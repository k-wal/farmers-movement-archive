In a setback to the Uddhav Thackeray-led-Maharashtra government and former minister Deshmukh, the Supreme Court Thursday dismissed their pleas challenging the Bombay high court order directing a CBI probe into allegations of corruption and misconduct levelled against him by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh. Speaking to reporters in Nagpur, Fadnavis said, "The Bombay high court had very clearly said that the allegations are such that the minister is under suspicion and this being a high profile case should be investigated by the CBI." "There was no point of him (Deshmukh) going to the SC, but he approached it nonetheless and the decision by the top court has given a befitting reply to the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) leaders, who were commenting on this issue," he said. "After the decision, the CBI will investigate this case and expose this extortion racket," he added.  Singh, in his plea filed on March 25, had sought a CBI probe against Deshmukh who, he claimed, had asked police officers, including suspended cop Sachin Waze, to extort Rs 100 crore from bars and restaurants. Deshmukh has denied any wrongdoing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cbi-will-now-expose-extortion-racket-devendra-fadnavis-on-sc-ruling/articleshow/81976034.cms||---

The Election Commission has made provisions for voting through postal ballot for citizens above 80 years of age and persons with disability from the comfort of their homes. In a letter to Sudeep Jain, the deputy election commissioner in charge of the state, Chowdhury, also the leader of the Congress party in the Lok Sabha, said that the decision of the poll panel to depute an unarmed civic volunteer should be changed. "The Election Commission has decided to allow the disabled persons and old aged infirm persons to cast votes from their houses instead of attending the election booth. It is learnt that it has been decided to escort the officer by civic volunteers having no arms while going to receive the casting of votes from respective houses of disabled persons. "Serious apprehension raised in my mind that there will be manipulation in casting of votes by disabled persons. Ruling party members will dominate the will of the disabled voters and will cast vote in favour of ruling party candidates frustrating the wise desire of Election Commission," the letter read. To ensure fair polling, two or more central force personnel should accompany officials going to houses of infirm people to get their votes, Chowdhury said. In the assembly election in the state, the BJP is trying to dethrone the Trinamool Congress while the Mamata Banerjee-led party is seeking to return to power for the third time in a row. Three of the eight phases of polling have been completed in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/central-force-personnel-should-go-with-officials-to-get-votes-of-infirm-people-adhir-ranjan-chowdhury/articleshow/81976323.cms||---

---||India||Total caseload tops 13 million, last 1 million in record 11 days||Even as fresh Covid-19 infections hit another single-day peak of over 1.3 lakh on Thursday, the country's total caseload crossed 13 million (1.3 crore), with the last 1 million cases coming in just 11 days. The time taken for the count to rise from 12 million to 13 million equalled the record for the fastest 1-million increase in cases, when the count rose from 4 million to 5 million in 11 days during the peak of the first wave in September. India has so far reported 13,057,812 cases of the coronavirus, the third highest total in the world after the US (31.6 million) and Brazil (13.2 million).  India has been logging the highest daily cases of the virus over the past few days. On Thursday, the country reported 1,31,918 new cases, beating the previous highest of 1.26 lakh recorded the previous day. This was the fourth fresh peak in daily cases since the count topped the 1 lakh mark on Sunday amid a surge in the pandemic numbers across the country. Thursday's Covid death toll rose to 802, which was the first time in 173 days since October 17 last year that the daily casualty count had exceeded 800. Maharashtra alone recorded 376 deaths in the last 24 hours, followed by Chhattisgarh, where as many as 94 fatalities were reported. Punjab recorded 56 deaths, Uttar Pradesh 39, Karnataka 36, Gujarat 35, Madhya Pradesh 27 and Delhi 24. As many as five states logged their biggest ever single-day surge in Covid cases, evidence that the pandemic's second wave was now raging across most of the country.  The five states were Chhattisgarh, where 10,652 fresh cases were detected, marginally higher than Wednesday's all-time high of 10,310.  Fresh cases in Uttar Pradesh touched a new peak of 8,490 for the first time since the first wave. Similarly, Rajasthan reported a new high of 3,526 while Gujarat cases topped 4,000 for the first time at 4,021. Madhya Pradesh's tally climbed yet again to 4,324. Twelve other states reported their daily surge of cases in 2021, including Delhi (7,437 cases, highest since November 19), Tamil Nadu (4,276, highest since October 17), Haryana (2,872, November 20), Bengal (2,783, December 10), Andhra Pradesh (2,558, November 5), Telangana (2,055, October 7), Bihar (1,911, September 4) and Jharkhand (1,882, highest since September 9). Infections have been rising in Kerala as well. The state logged 4,353 new cases on Thursday, the most since February 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/total-caseload-tops-13-million-last-1-million-in-record-11-days/articleshow/81978216.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

In other serious adverse events too, the overwhelming majority took place in the three-day window. Even as AEFI deaths are reported daily, causality assessment by the National AEFI Committee appears to be lagging with information about just 10 deaths in the public domain. Coronavirus: Live updatesMany of the AEFIs and deaths reported in India bear striking similarities to those recorded in the European Union and the UK, on the basis of which European Medicines Agency (EMA) has warned “healthcare professionals and people receiving the vaccine to remain aware of the possibility of very rare cases of blood clots combined with low levels of blood platelets occurring within 2 weeks of vaccination”. Read AlsoCovid-19: India has vaccine stocks for 5.5 days, 1 more week’s in pipelineData collated from the Union health ministry shows that states have on average just over five days of vaccine stocks remaining at their current levels of vaccination, and an additional week’s supply is in the pipeline. In some states like Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, however, current stocks are forPublic health activists who have been tracking adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) in the ongoing covid vaccination effort have repeatedly sought greater transparency in AEFI investigations and more rapid causality assessments to help inform vaccination policy. After initial denial, the European Union and the UK medicine regulators, following detailed investigation, have concluded that there is a possible link between some blood clotting events with low platelets and the Oxford-Astra Zeneca vaccine and have asked for these to be listed as “extremely rare potential side-effects”. However, they have asked for the vaccination to continue as benefits still outweigh risks. The presentation to National AEFI Committee on March 31, showed that over 90% of AEFI hospitalisations (276/305), more than 87% of cases of severe AEFI (55/63) and 93 out of 124 deaths happened within three days of the vaccination. “The majority of reported AEFIs occurring soon after doing may also represent a reporting bias as events happening after the initial few days could be getting missed out,” said Malini Aisola, a public health activist. She added that since Covishield is the same vaccine as the AstraZeneca one, warnings related to the rare conditions flagged by EMA, information for vaccine recipients and the public about when to seek medical attention, and information for health providers about how to identify and treat such occurrences needs to be done for Covishield too. Out of 86 such events reported in the EU and UK where 25 million people had received the vaccine, 18 were fatal. India has administered over 90 million doses, of which the bulk have been Covishield, the vaccine AstraZeneca licensed to the Serum Institute. Since the start of the vaccination drive on January 16, according to the health ministry press briefings, there were 9 deaths recorded by January 27, 46 by February 26 and 89 by March 16. “As expected, with the pace of vaccination picked up and the categories of those eligible for vaccination expanded, the number of deaths reported went up.  Between March 16 and 29 there were 91 deaths,” pointed out Siddartha Das, who has been tracking AEFI events reported from across the country. He added that with so many cases, the committee would have to work much faster to do proper causality assessment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/180-deaths-after-jabs-till-mar-31-75-within-3-days/articleshow/81978526.cms||Rema Nagarajan
---||Varanasi||Court orders ASI to survey Gyanvapi Mosque complex in Kashi||VARANASI: A local court on Thursday allowed a survey of the entire Gyanvapi Mosque complex, adjacent to the Kashi Vishwanath temple here, by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to find out "whether the religious structure standing at the present and disputed site is a superimposition, alteration or addition, or there is structural overlapping of any kind". The order came just over a year after the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya, saying there will be a Ram Mandir at the disputed site and Muslims will be given an alternate 5-acre land for their mosque. In its order on Thursday, the court of civil judge (senior division), fast track, Ashutosh Tiwari, directed the ASI director general to constitute a five-member committee of eminent persons who are experts and well-versed in the science of archaeology, two of whom should preferably belong to the minority community. In its order, the court also directed the DG to appoint an eminent and highly experienced person, who can be regarded as expert in the science of archaeology, to act as observer. "Such person should preferably be a scholarly personality and established academician of any central university," it said. The five-member committee shall submit a report of its survey work to the observer on a daily basis. The court further said the "committee shall prepare comprehensive documentation along with the drawing, plan, elevation, site map with precise breadth and width of the disputed site, marked with hatched lines in the plaint map". "The purpose of the archaeological survey shall be to find out as to whether the religious structure standing at the present and disputed site is a superimposition, alteration or addition or there is structural overlapping of any kind. If so, then what exactly is the age, size, monumental and architectural design or style of the religious structure, and what material has been used for building the same," the court said. For that purpose, the committee shall be entitled to enter into every portion of the religious structure, the order said. The committee shall first resort to ground penetrating radar or geo-radiology system or both to satisfy itself as to whether any excavation or extraction work is needed in any portion. The excavation should be done by trial trench method vertically on a very small scale, and horizontal excavation shall be done only when the committee is fully satisfied of being able to reach a more concrete conclusion regarding the archaeological remains below the ground. Advocate Vijay Shankar Rastogi, as the "next friend" of Swayambhu Jyotirlinga Bhagwan Vishweshwar, had filed an application in the court of civil judge in December 2019 requesting a survey of the entire Gyanvapi compound by the ASI. He also demanded the restoration of the land on which the mosque stood to Hindus, claiming that Mughal emperor Aurangzeb had pulled down parts of the old Kashi Vishwanath temple to build it. In January 2020, defendant Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Committee had filed an objection against the petition. The first petition was filed in Varanasi civil court in 1991, seeking permission for worship in Gyanvapi. The petitioner had contended that the temple was built by Maharaja Vikramaditya about 2,050 years ago, but Aurangzeb destroyed it in 1664 and used its remains to construct a mosque, which is known as Gyanvapi masjid, on a portion of the temple land. The petitioner had requested the court to issue directions for removal of the mosque from the temple land and give back its possession to the temple trust. The petition contended that the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act was not applicable on the suit as the mosque was constructed over a partly demolished temple and many parts of the temple exist even today. In 1998, the Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Committee moved the high court contending the mandir-masjid dispute could not be adjudicated by a civil court as it was barred by law. The high court then stayed the proceedings in the lower court. In February 2020, the petitioners approached the lower court again to resume hearing as the HC had not extended the stay in the past six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/varanasi-court-orders-archaeological-survey-of-india-to-survey-gyanvapi-complex/articleshow/81978667.cms||Binay Singh

"We are all aviators," Australia's Chief of Air Force, Air Marshal Mel Hupfeld said. "In everything that we do, we are aviators first and foremost." The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) statement did not explicitly credit the change in language to the increasing number of women in its ranks. Rather it said the service wanted to instil a stronger sense of identity. Women make up more than 20% of the nearly 15,000 personnel in the RAAF, a 2019 report found, the highest female participation in any branch of the country's military. The air force aims to have women make up 25% of its members by 2023.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/we-are-all-aviators-australian-air-force-replaces-the-term-airmen/articleshow/81978789.cms||---
---||India||Supreme Court: Rohingya won’t be freed but deportation must be as per law||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a plea for release of illegal Rohingya Muslims who have been detained in Jammu, and said the Union government could deport them to Myanmar only after scrupulously adhering to the procedures prescribed under law. Two Rohingya migrants, staying in refugee camps in Delhi since 2011, had moved the SC through advocate Prashant Bhushan seeking release of fellow illegal migrants on the ground that they faced threat to life and limb if forcibly deported to Myanmar, especially after the military coup. Bhushan had cited a judgment of the International Court of Justice to persuade the SC to intervene. Even the UN special rapporteur had unsuccessfully attempted to intervene in support of continued stay of Rohingya migrants in India. This was opposed by solicitor general Tushar Mehta who told the court that the Union government would scrupulously follow the provisions of the Foreigners Act while dealing with the illegal migrants, and expressed the government’s resolve not to allow India to become the capital for illegal migrants. Mehta said the ICJ ruling cited by Bhushan was for states who were signatories to the UN Refugee Convention, and had no application to India which had not signed the treaty. A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde rejected Bhushan’s pleas but said, “It is not possible to grant interim relief. However, it is made clear that the Rohingyas in Jammu... shall not be deported unless the procedure prescribed for such deportation is followed”. Meeting Bhushan’s argument that the right to life of Rohingya migrants must be respected by the Union government and the SC, the bench said, “It is also true that the rights guaranteed under Articles 14 and 21 are available to all persons who may or may not be (Indian) citizens. But the right not to be deported is ancillary or concomitant to the right to reside or settle in any part of the territory of India guaranteed under Article 19(1)(e)”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-rohingya-wont-be-freed-but-deportation-must-be-as-per-law/articleshow/81978832.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The collegium, also comprising CJI-designate N V Ramana and Justices R F Nariman, U U Lalit and A M Khanwilkar, met in the afternoon but discussed no names. TOI had reported on Thursday that as per convention, no CJI schedules a collegium meeting after the President appoints his successor. President Ram Nath Kovind had appointed Justice Ramana as the next CJI with effect from April 24. CJI Bobde retires on April 23. CJI Bobde, in his tenure of one year and five months, could not recommend a single name to the government for appointment as SC judge.  The oldest vacancy in the SC, caused by CJI Ranjan Gogoi’s retirement on November 17, 2019, has not yet been filled. Since then, four more judges — Justices Deepak Gupta, R Banumathi, Arun Mishra and Indu Malhotra — have retired, taking the total vacancies to five. He will be the only CJI to retire without appointing a judge to the SC. A precedent of this nature was escaped by CJI H L Dattu, who during his tenure had made only one appointment to the SC in Justice Amitava Roy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-collegium-meets-but-discusses-no-names/articleshow/81978948.cms||---

This will start from the current rabi marketing season (RMS), which will kick off in Punjab from Saturday. With this, the MSP payment to farmers across the country will become online. Food and public distribution secretary Sudhanshu Pandey told TOI, “The MSP given to farmers shall be paid directly to their bank accounts on the basis of physical document of the land duly counter signed by either patwari or sarpanch of the village. In six months, the land record will also be integrated online.” The arhtiyas will continue to get their commission of 2.5% separately, officials said. The breakthrough came at a meeting chaired by food minister Piyush Goyal which was attended by four ministers from Punjab, including finance and food ministers. Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal told TOI, “The Centre refused to budge on the direct cash transfer issue and insisted that Punjab will have to transfer money directly to the farmers within 48 hours. Else, they said, they (the Centre) will not procure from Punjab.” Badal said he and food minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu tried to convince Goyal that there has been a tradition of making payments through the arhtiyas in the state, but Goyal outrightly rejected it. Having hit a dead end, Punjab will now discuss the issue with the arhtiyas. “CM Capt Amarinder Singh will be meeting the arhtiyas on Friday. We will work out a mechanism where some protection can be given to the arhtiyas and procurement can begin,” Ashu said. Is Punjab DBT ready? Punjab has been demanding exemption from direct payment and wants the arhtiyas to continue to play a role. However, sources say the DBT payment systems in Punjab were almost ready, something that has been conveyed to the Centre by various agencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/punjab-bows-to-centre-agrees-to-transfer-cash-directly-to-farmers/articleshow/81978978.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||India||Blow to Maharashtra govt as CBI gets SC go-ahead||NEW DELHI: In a setback to the Maharashtra government and its former home minister Anil Deshmukh, the Supreme Court on Thursday allowed the CBI to go ahead with its probe into former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s allegations against the NCP functionary of extortion, bribes for transfers and interference in investigations into important criminal cases. A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hemant Gupta said probe by an independent agency was needed in the case in view of involvement of high-profile figures of the level of minister and former Mumbai police chief in the controversy. The bench said the minister and the police chief were hand in glove and working together till they fell apart. The apex court said it was not a case of corporate or political rivalry but a “virtual right hand man” of the minister making allegations against him. Senior advocates A M Singhvi and Kapil Sibal, appearing respectively for the Maharashtra government and Deshmukh, tried their best to convince the bench that the HC order was illegal as it was passed without giving an opportunity to the minister to counter the allegations and it will set a bad precedent if a probe is ordered on hearsay without credible evidence against a person. They invoked the SC verdict in the Birla-Sahara diary case to emphasise that investigation against a person can be ordered only when there is prima facie evidence against him and not on the basis of diary entry or allegations. Sibal said that law must be equally applicable to all. But the court dismissed their plea and was so convinced about the correctness of the HC order that the order was passed without hearing Param Bir Singh and other opposite parties. Senior advocates Harish Salve, Mukul Rohatgi and Ranjit Kumar did not have to argue the case against the state government and the former minister. “Dehors the niceties of an elaborate order passed by the HC, we are of the view that the nature of allegations, the personas involved and the seriousness of the allegations do require an independent agency to inquire into the matter. It is a matter of public confidence, given the factual scenario. We may also add that what has been directed is a preliminary inquiry albeit by an independent agency,” the court said. Singhvi and Sibal had contended that the CBI probe was not required after Deshmukh’s resignation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/blow-to-maharashtra-govt-as-cbi-gets-sc-go-ahead/articleshow/81978973.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||World||Joe Biden targets ‘ghost guns’ as he introduces limited firearm curbs||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden and his Attorney General Merrick Garland announced limited measures to tackle gun violence in the United States on Thursday, in what the White House described as a first step to curb mass shootings, community bloodshed and suicides. The new measures include plans for the Justice Department to crack down on self-assembled "ghost guns," and make "stabilizing braces" - which effectively turn pistols into rifles - subject to registration under the National Firearms Act. Biden said he will also ask the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to release an annual report on firearms trafficking in the United States, and make it easier for states to adopt "Red Flag" laws that flag at-risk individuals who own guns. "Today we're taking steps to confront not just the gun crisis, but what is actually a public health crisis," Biden said, speaking in the Rose Garden to an audience filled with family members of victims of gun violence. He noted another mass shooting in South Carolina this week. "This is an epidemic for God's sake and it has to stop," Biden said. Biden, a Democrat who has a long history of advocating for gun restrictions, has come under pressure to step up action after recent mass shootings in Colorado and Georgia. Biden announced the measures alongside Vice President Kamala Harris and Garland, who Biden said would prioritize gun violence as head of the Department of Justice. "We've had more tragedy than we can bear," Harris said. "People on both sides of the aisle want action. Real people on both sides of the aisle want action .... So all that is left is will and the courage to act." The measures Biden unveiled do not meet all of his campaign promises and are not legislative. The White House says the president will continue to push for Congress to take more aggressive steps. Gun control is a divisive issue in the United States, which has experienced a significant number of deadly mass shootings at schools and other public venues for decades. The U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/joe-biden-targets-ghost-guns-as-he-introduces-limited-firearm-curbs/articleshow/81979017.cms||---

This was even as the MEA again underlined the need for early disengagement in the remaining areas in eastern Ladakh and said this would lead to de-escalation and “hopefully lead to restoration of peace and tranquillity and provide conditions for our overall bilateral relationship”. Asked if China could consider India’s position that the pre-April 2020 status quo be restored, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said that was something for the two sides to discuss during talks. “The ins and outs of the China-India border issue are very clear. The responsibility does not rest with China. It is hoped that India will meet with China halfway, earnestly implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, strictly abide by the agreements signed by the two sides, and take concrete actions to further ease the border situation,” Zhao said. While refusing to confirm the date for the 11th round of military talks, the Chinese foreign ministry also denied that there had been a delay in holding dialogue for further disengagement in eastern Ladakh. Zhao said the two countries were talking about holding the next round of military talks. It was reported on Wednesday that the talks were going to be held on Friday.

The insurgents released him deep in the forests of South Bastar in Chhattisgarh, some 20-22km from the ambush site where 22 soldiers, including some of Manhas’ colleagues, were martyred on April 3. It was an unconditional release. The abducted CRPF commando was handed over to social worker Dharampal Saini, tribal leader Telam Boraiya, Sukmati Hakka, sarpanch of Murtunda in Bijapur and Rudra Khare, a retired teacher, who were the emissaries for his release, an official said. The commando’s family was overwhelmed with joy. “I have received official communication of his safe return. He is in good health. Today is the happiest day of my life. I always remained hopeful of his return,” said his wife, Meenu. Home minister Amit Shah spoke with Rakeshwar Manhas and his family members over phone and asked about his well-being. Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel and state home minister Tamradhwaj Sahu also expressed happiness at the commando’s release and thanked the interlocutors and officials who made it happen. Manhas was freed around 4.30pm. He didn’t speak to mediapersons and was taken straight to hospital. Videos of the release show armed Maoists untying the ropes that bind his arms as villagers watch. He was brought to the Tarrem camp — 8km from the Tekulguda ambush site — and then shifted to the field hospital in Basaguda as he was suffering from weakness and dehydration. Local reporters Ganesh Mishra and Mukesh Chandrakar, who were among the interlocutors, said, “The Maoists had told us that unless the state government sends a team of interlocutors, they wouldn’t release him. We contacted Bastar range IG P Sundarraj and he formed a team of social workers. We then received a call from Maoists on April 5 and they asked us to reach Junnaguda.” The team was taken 15km deep into the forest from Junnaguda, where Manhas was released.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/maoists-free-crpf-jawan-after-five-days/articleshow/81979063.cms||Rashmi Drolia

The BJP government will create anti-Romeo squads and put each of these Romeos behind bars,” Adityanath said at a BJP rally in Hooghly’s Chanditala. UP’s anti-Romeo squads had faced severe all-round criticism for meting out “punishment” — making them do sit-ups in public or shaving their heads — till the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad HC directed UP police to follow the rule book. There were frequent allegations of these teams targeting couples in a consensual relationship. The UP CM, aware of Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee’s following among women voters, promised several plans targeted at women. “The BJP government will ensure free education for girls from KG to PG. The government will also ensure free travel for women on public transport,” the UP chief minister said. Mamata would also start chanting “Jai Shri Ram” after the assembly poll results on May 2, Adityanath said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/will-set-up-anti-romeo-squads-in-bengal-yogi-adityanath/articleshow/81979097.cms||Falguni Banerjee

Four of those wounded in the shooting rampage at Kent Moore Cabinets, a warehouse-sized facility at an industrial park in Bryan, Texas, were rushed to area hospitals in critical condition, the police department said on Twitter. The suspect was not immediately identified, although police said he had been employed at Kent Moore Cabinets. Investigators said they did not yet know what motivated the deadly outburst of workplace violence in east-central Texas. One victim was found shot dead at the scene, along with four others badly wounded by gunfire. A sixth person who sustained an unspecified minor injury and a seventh who suffered a medical emergency initially described as an apparent asthma attack, were also rushed to area hospitals, according to the Bryan Police Department. In addition, the Texas Department of Public safety said a state trooper was shot and wounded during a pursuit of the suspect into a neighboring county and was hospitalized in serious but stable condition. Authorities provided few details of the attack itself. Houston-based television station KPRC-TV, an NBC affiliate, quoted Police Chief Eric Buske as saying the shooting occurred in the "bays" of the plant and the gunman had fled the scene by the time police arrived. KPRC, citing police, also reported the suspect was believed to have opened fire with a handgun. Bryan, a town of about 87,000 residents and the seat of Brazos County, is a short drive from Texas A&M University in nearby College Station about 100 miles northwest of Houston. The Brazos Industrial Park where the shooting unfolded lies just southwest of the tidy-looking downtown area of the city, whose official motto is "The Good Life, Texas Style." The rampage is the latest in a string of at least a half-dozen deadly mass shootings across the United States since mid-March. Eight people were slain at Atlanta-area spas, 10 people at a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado, and four people, including a 9-year-old boy at a real estate office in Orange, California. On Wednesday, a former professional football player shot and killed a South Carolina doctor, his wife, two grandchildren and another man before taking his own life. Hours before the shooting in Texas, US President Joe Biden and US Attorney General Merrick Garland announced limited measures to tackle a surge in US gun violence in recent years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/gunman-opens-fire-at-texas-cabinet-business-at-least-one-dead/articleshow/81979121.cms||---
---||Business||Supreme Court rules in favour of taxpayers, stay of I-T demand can continue beyond 365 days||MUMBAI: A three-member bench of the Supreme Court, has recently struck down a proviso in the Income-tax (I-T) Act, which curtailed the powers of the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), to grant stay of demand for a period exceeding 365 days, even if the delay in disposing of the appeal was not owing to any fault of the taxpayer. This third proviso to section 254 (2A) was introduced with effect from October 1, 2008. The Supreme Court bench has held this proviso to be “arbitrary, discriminatory and in gross violation of the principles enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution of India.” In this case, Pepsico India, which was aggrieved by an assessment order for the financial year 2007-08, filed an appeal with the ITAT. On May 31, 2013, the ITAT granted stay on the assessment order which was further extended till May 28, 2014. Since no further extension of stay could be granted beyond the period of 365 days in view of third proviso to section 254(2A) of the Act, Pepsico India filed a writ petition before the Delhi High Court challenging the constitutional validity of the third proviso. The Delhi High Court struck down the part of third proviso which denied extension of stay beyond 365 days for no fault of the taxpayer. The tax authorities challenged this order before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court upheld the Delhi High Court’s order. It observed that though the apparent object of section 254(2A) seems to provide for expeditious disposal of appeals, no differentiation is made by the third proviso between the taxpayers who are responsible for delaying the proceedings and taxpayers who are not so responsible thereby treating ‘unequals also equally’. The Apex Court stated that the object of the provisions itself cannot be discriminatory. It held that any order of stay of demand shall stand vacated after the expiry of the period or periods mentioned in this section, only if the delay in disposing off the appeal is attributable to the taxpayer. According to Rakesh Nangia, chairman Nangia Andersen India, “The well-reasoned judgment, holding the provision of the I-T Act as capricious, irrational and disproportionate, reinstates the faith of the taxpayers in the Indian Judiciary. Keeping aside the golden rule of interpretation of statutes, the Supreme Court agreed that where literal interpretation of a statutory provision produces a manifestly unjust result, which could never have been intended by the Legislature, the court may modify the language so as to achieve the intention and produce a rational construction. Consequently, the Supreme Court established that if a policy is arbitrary and discriminatory then such policy will have to be struck down.” “ The Apex Court has now made it clear that once a stay is granted, it cannot be vacated unless delay in disposing the appeal is attributable to the taxpayer,” adds Nangia. In its tax alert, Dhruva Advisors sums up, “This decision brings much needed respite to and instils confidence in taxpayers who were otherwise coerced by the Revenue to cough up the outstanding demand even while the matter was pending for disposal before the ITAT without any fault of their own. This ruling will go a long way in restoring taxpayer’s faith in judiciary in protecting their fundamental rights.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/supreme-court-rules-in-favour-of-taxpayers-stay-of-i-t-demand-can-continue-beyond-365-days/articleshow/81979162.cms||Lubna Kably

Initially, six truckloads of troops were deployed to quell protesters in the town of Taze, the Myanmar Now and Irrawaddy news outlets said. When the protesters fought back with handmade guns, knives and firebombs, five more truckloads of troops were brought in. Fighting continued into Thursday morning and at least 11 protesters were killed and about 20 wounded, the media said. There was no word of any casualties among the soldiers. That would take the toll of civilians killed by security forces to over 600 since the junta seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP). It had a toll of 598 dead as of Wednesday evening. Taze is near the town of Kale, where at least 12 people were killed in a similar clash between troops and protesters on Wednesday, according to news media and witnesses. Security forces fired live rounds, grenades, and machine-guns on protesters who were demanding the restoration of Suu Kyi's government, AAPP said. "Taze, Kale have many hunters in the jungle," said Hein Min Hteik, a resident of the region and a youth activist. "They have handmade firearms. And now they came out with their weapons in order to protect the locals, while the people were under attack by the junta." A spokesman for the junta could not be reached for comment. "People will try to defend their own lives and their rights," said a former government minister who is part of the CRPH, a group of lawmakers representing the ousted civilian government. "People will not wait for CRPH to act," the minister said in a video call with Reuters. "The CRPH cannot stop the possible armed resistance by the people, from the people." The junta on Thursday arrested Paing Takhon, a model and actor who had spoken out against the coup, his sister told Reuters. In Yangon, the country's biggest city, activists placed shoes filled with flowers to commemorate dead protesters. AAPP has said 2,847 people were currently being held in detention. In addition, arrest warrants have been issued for hundreds of people, with the junta this week going after scores of influencers, entertainers, artists and musicians. 'LOCKED OUT OF EMBASSY' Paing Takhon, 24, well-known in Myanmar and Thailand, was one of the latest celebrities to be detained. He had condemned the military takeover and pledged support for Suu Kyi. His sister, Thi Thi Lwin, told Reuters that the military detained her brother at 4.30 am at their parents' home in Yangon, where he had been staying for several days while unwell, suffering from malaria and a heart condition. The security forces came with eight military trucks and about 50 soldiers and it was unclear where he had been taken, she said. The country’s most famous comedian, Zarganar, was arrested on Tuesday, media reported. Overseas, tussles for control of Myanmar's diplomatic missions emerged again on Wednesday. Myanmar's ambassador to London Kyaw Zwar Minn said he was locked out of the embassy, with sources saying his deputy had shut him out and taken charge on behalf of the military. Kyaw Zwar Minn has broken ranks with the ruling junta in recent weeks, calling for the release of detained civilian leader Suu Kyi. "It's a kind of coup, in the middle of London... you can see that they occupy my building," he told Reuters. There have also been similar counter claims in embassies in other global centres and at the United Nations. Meanwhile, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the junta's leader, said in a statement on Wednesday that the civil disobedience movement, or CDM, had halted the working of hospitals, schools, roads, offices and factories. "CDM is an activity to destroy the country," he said. Fitch Solutions said in a report that Western sanctions targeting the military were unlikely to succeed in restoring democracy, but said the army was losing control. It predicted a violent revolution pitting the military against an armed opposition comprised of members of the anti-coup movement and ethnic militias. "The escalating violence on civilians and ethnic militias show that the Tatmadaw (military) is increasingly losing control of the country," it said. The vast majority of people back Suu Kyi's ousted government, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/11-killed-as-myanmar-protesters-fight-troops/articleshow/81979168.cms||---

All these animals and birds were being reared by Rajesh Sinha, an affluent farmer. Police said the animals and birds were probably killed over a property dispute or business rivalry. Fatuha SDPO Rajesh Kumar Manjhi said Sinha owns at least 40-bigha land in Fatuha. “He had returned home from Mumbai during Covid-induced lockdown last year and ventured into agriculture and animal and poultry rearing,” Manjhi said, adding Sinha doubts the involvement of some locals, including his brother, in the incident. “Sinha has so far not submitted any written complaint. He had not complained even when mushroom farm was destroyed earlier,” the SDPO said. Manjhi said at least four people reached Sinha’s farm in the wee hours of Thursday and held the guard, Sunil Gop, hostage at gunpoint. “Three of them entered the farm and killed the animals and birds one by one,” he said. Meanwhile, Akhilesh Singh, a sub-inspector posted at Khusrupur police station, said Patna district’s touring veterinary officer Dr Sudhanshu Kumar was called for conducting post-mortem of the dead animals and birds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/goats-birds-killed-over-property-row/articleshow/81974720.cms||Debashish Karmakar

A show-cause notice has been served to all the BEOs to explain their negligence and poor performance in this regard. The DEO in his order passed on Wednesday has mentioned that all BEOs under the district were asked to report the progress of vaccination in two dedicated forms for the purpose daily at his office but they either failed to report or submitted the forms with incomplete information.

It was 2.5 to 3.5 before the district started witnessing more number of Covid positive cases. TPR stood at 4.6 on Tuesday when around 10,000 tests were conducted. The health authorities hope that the positivity rate will not bounce back to six in next 10 days. The district witnessed 20% increase in cases this week compared to the previous week. “Maximum socializing of people happened during the election campaign. We don’t expect socializing of people anymore. But we are keeping fingers crossed thinking of the situation in the next 10 days,” said district programme officer (Ernakulam) Dr Mathew Numpeli. The requests from authorities urging the public to cooperate with them in preventing the spread of the infection are falling on deaf ears. Most of the cases daily reported in Ernakulam are from Thrikkakara, Edathala, Kalamassery and neighbouring places. Health authorities say the cases are recurring from these places because primary contacts refuse to reveal that they came in contact with an infected person. “Most of these cases are related to institutional clusters. When we trace primary contacts, they refuse to cooperate with us by claiming that they have not come into contact with the infected person. This is to evade quarantine. More people are getting infected from those who refuse to undergo quarantine. Edathala, Keezhmad, Thrikkakara, Vengola and Perumbavoor are interconnected. As many as 100 cases were reported from Munambam in connection with a marriage function last month. Pallippuram and Vadakkekara reported positive cases after this event. The source of infection was a person who came from Thrissur to attend the function. It is still an active cluster. Though large number of cases are reported from corporation limit, these places report more when we look into per million people,” said another health official. Health officials anticipate that number of cases will rise exponentially from Thursday. This will lead to increase in ICU admissions after two to three weeks. Complicated cases will be reported after some time. Another cause for concern is that healthcare workers who got vaccinated are also testing positive for coronavirus. “Such cases are getting reported as the efficacy of the vaccine is 75%,” said Dr Numpeli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/covid-19-tpr-in-ernakulam-inching-towards-five/articleshow/81975722.cms||---

The new campaign, introduced with two 35-second films, shows how men changing the conversation can create a safe and equal world for women and girls. Titled ‘Soch Badlein, Baat Badlegi’, the campaign informs men that changing how they think will lead to a change in the conversation, and the world will also change. One film shows men commenting when a girl passes by on a cycle. The other shows boys whispering to each other when a girl bowls out a batsman. In the first, the men actually remark if roads were better, it would be safer for kids to go to school; in the second, the boys say the girl has the potential to make it to the Indian team. “Patriarchy promotes toxic masculinity that dehumanizes men and fosters discrimination and violence against women and girls. This campaign urges men to look inwards, examine the kind of masculinity they want to embrace, free themselves of patriarchal learning and reclaim their humanity. It aims to inspire men to transform the way they view women, talk and behave, thereby creating communities and families where women can live violence-free and equal lives. It shows men who view women as individuals deserving respect, not as objects,” said Swayam director Anuradha Kapoor. Sk Ashraf Ali of Metiabruz who grew up believing men have to be rough and devoid of emotions, said it distanced him from his family. “It is only after I became aware that being emotional was not a sign of weakness, that the relationship changed and we began to have meaningful conversations,” said Ali. Kapoor said once men’s attitude towards women changes, women will feel safe. “Men don’t have to play the role of a protector or saviour. All they need to do is treat women as their equals,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/feminist-groups-gender-equality-drive-inspires-men-to-change-how-they-think/articleshow/81977270.cms||Subhro Niyogi

According to the manager of the plant, Bipil Bariyar, at least 7,200 bottles will now be produced every day, thereby fulfilling the needs of passengers during the peak summer season. “The Khagaul-based plant, which was set up in 2004 on the initiative of the then railway minister Nitish Kumar, has been supplying Rail Neer bottles to Bhubaneswar, Kolkata, Guwahati, Sonepur and several parts of Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh to cater to the needs of passengers,” Bariyar told this reporter. The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) had launched Rail Neer. “Based on an advanced technology, the plant is fully automatic and involves no manual handling of the product at any stage as a result of which the quality and purity of the water are maintained,” senior public relations officer of the IRCTC, A K Jha, said. He added, “Amid rise in demand for Rail Neer bottles at railway stations and low production capacity at the moment, the IRCTC is likely to set up six more plants across the country to ensure easy supply in all the zones of the railways.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rail-neer-plant-restarts-producing-water-bottles/articleshow/81974519.cms||Kumod Verma

The recovery was made barely a month after the recovery of a SIM card from the bag of an inmate Vijay Krishna, a former MP, two cell phones from the jail barbershop and two registers containing five bank accounts and 20 cell phone numbers during a raid by DM Chandrashekhar Singh and SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma on March 3. The inspectorate of prisons and correctional services sources said that an FIR has been lodged with the Beur police station in connection with the recoveries made on Thursday. Sources said the two cellphones and a charger were found buried behind the jail's Godavari block while another cell phone was hidden behind the Yamuna block. “There was specific input about hidden cell phones and chargers at some locations. Based on those inputs, the recoveries were made. No SIM cards were recovered from these cell phones,” a prison source said. The source said at both locations garbage was dumped on the soil on which even grass had grown. “Spades were used to dig up the soil to recover the electronic items,” he said. Sources said only Godavari and Yamuna blocks were searched during the raid on Thursday. “The search started around 6.45 am and ended at 8.55 am,” the source said. On March 3, statewide simultaneous and coordinated raids were carried out in all central, district and sub-jails leading to the recovery of 36 phones, 7 SIM cards, 17 chargers and more than 200 grams of chewing tobacco. Beur jail deputy superintendent Sanjay Kumar arrived late due to which the DM and SSP had to wait for at least half an hour, which alerted the inmates. IG (Prisons and correctional services) Mithilesh Mishra later suspended Kumar for dereliction of duty on the DM's recommendation. Mishra also suspended Nawada district jail deputy superintendent Ramvilash Das and two warders over recovery of nine cell phones, four chargers, three batteries, two decks of playing cards and one earphone from the jail. On March 10, the home department posted Jitendra Kumar as the new superintendent of Beur jail by replacing Satyendra Kumar. ‘Strengthen e-Mulakat facility’: IG (prisons and correctional services) Mithilesh Mishra Thursday directed all prison authorities to lay emphasis on eMulakat and strengthen the system so that they can relieve their stress by interacting with family members, relatives as well as lawyers via video-conferencing after registration on the eprisons website. He said the surge in Covid-19 cases has once again created a situation that visitors inside jail premises would continue to remain barred for the next several months. “Talks are ongoing to allow visitors but now it would remain barred for the next several months due to the spike in cases,” he said. The system was started last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/3-cellphones-charger-found-buried-during-raid-in-beur-jail/articleshow/81974549.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The month also witnessed, for the first time ever, inflows through systematic investment plans (SIPs) cross the Rs 9k cr mark, data from industry trade body AMFI showed. The data for fiscal 2021 also showed that the fund industry had grown its assets under management (AUM) by 41% to Rs 31.4 lakh crore. This came mainly because of the smart recovery in the stock market in the last one year after leading indices had reached multi-year lows just a week before the end of fiscal 2020. AMFI data showed that during March this year, equity funds witnessed a net inflow at Rs 9,115 crore. A little over Rs 2,000 crore net inflow came in through thematic & sectoral funds, Rs 1,552 crore through ELSS and Rs 1,503 crore through midcap funds. Debt funds, however, continued to record net outflow at Rs 52,528 crore, mainly because corporates took money out of liquid and low-duration funds to meet their advance tax liability during March. This is a normal affair that is seen every quarter, fund industry players said. FY21 also recorded good growth of MF assets from places that are outside of the metros and top cities, called Beyond 30 or B30 locations in industry parlance. According to AMFI chief executive N S Venkatesh, FY21 saw rising acceptance for MFs from tier-2 and -3 locations, with MF AUM from B30 rising 54% to Rs 5.4 lakh crore by the close of the year, compared to Rs 3.5 lakh crore a year earlier. The year also saw the average AUM by SBI MF crossing the Rs 5-lakh-crore mark. The fund house is the first one to achieve this milestone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mfs-jump-41-in-fy21-gain-from-equity-highs/articleshow/81976866.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Bengal govt ramps up manpower, services as cases rise||KOLKATA: From strengthening the pool of medical manpower at Covid hospitals, ramping up Covid beds, reactivating safe homes and streamlining the ambulance services to forming various teams, the state is pulling up its socks to tackle the upsurge in Covid cases. On Thursday, 2,783 fresh cases emerged in the state, up by almost 400 from the previous day. The health department has deputed a batch of 33 medical officers, including specialists in various disciplines, for Covid wards across hospitals. Sources in the health department indicated further enhancement of manpower. “We might have to keep augmenting and revamping manpower as and when the situation demands. Things are definitely going to be worse,” said a health department official. On Thursday, the health department also directed officials of all medical colleges and district health administrations to ensure that a fleet of 102 ambulances is reserved for ferrying Covid patients which will not be utilized for any other purpose. Kolkata has about 90 such ambulances that the state deployed during the first wave. Nine officers (WBCS) on roster have been entrusted to guide members of the Covid admission cell. Eight IAS officers, along with the DME and DHS, have been assigned to look after different divisions. The number of active cases in the state has reached a little above 16,000, of which Kolkata’s share is 5,223. On March 31, the number of active cases in Bengal was 5,775. Hospitals, especially in Kolkata and the neighbouring districts, have been asked to ramp up Covid beds. “We have 40 Covid beds, including 16 critical care ones. As an immediate measure, we will ramp up our Covid beds to 60, including 29 critical care beds. We have planned to increase our stock of non-invasive ventilators and HFNOs to overcome any crisis,” said R Venkatesh, zonal director east, Narayana Health. Other hospitals are preparing to enhance beds too. “We are converting a 40-bed unit into a Covid ward,” said a source at RG Kar Medical College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/govt-ramps-up-manpower-services-as-cases-rise/articleshow/81976837.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC moves to protect legal rights of minor victims in Pocso cases||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Thursday passed several directions to ensure that legal rights of child victims under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act were not flouted. It held that the Act had created a legal framework for the child’s family and legal counsel to be present or represented during hearing of bail pleas by the accused. Section 40 of the Pocso Act mandates that if the family or the guardian of the child are unable to afford a legal counsel, the legal services authority shall provide a lawyer to them. As a “necessary corollary”, the child’s family and legal counsel are entitled to be informed about applications being filed and scheduled for hearing in pending cases, said the HC bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni while disposing of a public interest litigation (PIL) by activist Arjun Malge. Malge through his counsel Somasekhar Sundaresan sought the court’s intervention to ensure “strict implementation” of the Pocso provisions along with section 439(1A)of the criminal procedure code (CrPC) that provides for presence of informant or her representative during bail hearings in rape cases. Sundaresan showed the bench several orders by special Pocso courts. The high court said, “We see from such orders that the courts concerned have completely overlooked the mandate of Section 40 of the Pocso Act read with Rule 4.” It added, “Considering the avowed legislative intent of such provisions, it thus cannot be countenanced that when it comes to the administration of criminal justice, the stakeholders who are concerned with the investigation of such offences, as also the special courts…overlook and not implement the mandate of such solemn provisions.” The high court said that the prosecution and the accused should serve a notice to the child/family if either of them make an application. Before proceeding to hear an application, the special trial court must ascertain the status of service of notice, and if it is found that a notice has not been issued, the court may pass orders to secure ends of justice, but also consider any emergent circumstances that warrant hearing an application in the absence of the child’s family or counsel. If after the notice, the family does not attend the hearing, the court may proceed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-moves-to-protect-legal-rights-of-minor-victims-in-pocso-cases/articleshow/81978365.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Business||Q4 may see highest revenue growth in 8 quarters for India Inc||MUMBAI: After several quarters of negative to low revenue growth, India Inc could expect a double-digit expansion as the results for the quarter ended March 2021 (Q4FY21) start rolling out in a few days. This sharp rise in revenues and profit would be due to a low base, supportive demand environment and strong cost reductions since the pandemic started a year ago, analysts said. According to a report by Crisil Research, India Inc is expected to report a jump of 15-17% in Q4FY21 revenues. The strong corporate numbers are expected to be reported mainly by the larger players, which displayed more resilience than mid and smaller corporates in dealing with the impact of the pandemic. However, this analysis of 300 top companies does not include those from banking, BFSI and oil companies. “There has been a recovery across sectors led by higher volumes and commodity prices, although consumer discretionary services, such as airline services and media, continue to tread water. Sequentially, revenue is up 6-7% on-quarter,” the Crisil report noted. “However, overall revenue growth for India Inc was constrained by a fall in consumer discretionary products and services revenue. The pandemic posed a severe blow to players in this segment as revenue fell 10-12% on-year in fiscal 2021 due to a shift in consumer spending patterns, with consumers increasingly cautious about spending money,” the report said. A report by Edelweiss also noted that larger companies would lead this recovery. For the Nifty 50 companies, low base and strong earnings momentum are likely to propel earnings growth to a record 100%-plus rate on a yearly basis, analysts at Edelweiss wrote in the note. “On a reported basis, profit growth is likely to be very strong in cyclicals — commodities, banks, industrials and consumer discretionary (except auto). However, some softening of earnings momentum is likely in FMCG, cement and domestic auto owing to rising input price pressures,” the analysts said. In the software sector, a supportive demand environment and large deal wins would result in strong growth in Q4FY21, despite cost pressures. According to analysts at Motilal Oswal Securities, tier-1 software companies are expected to report growth of between 2.5% and 3.4% on a quarterly basis — their strongest Q4 performance in the last five years. In the BFSI segment, the annual growth in Q4 profits would be about 20%, mainly on the back of an uptick in credit growth, stable net interest margins (NIMs), and seasonally strong fee income during the quarter. This data does not include numbers by Yes Bank, a report by ICICI Securities said. The fourth quarter of the financial year is seasonally strong, both on sourcing as well as collections. However, trend would be divergent across product categories: Home loans to lead, CV, cab aggregators, wholesale real estate to drag, the I-Secs report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/q4-may-see-highest-revenue-growth-in-8-qtrs-for-india-inc/articleshow/81976839.cms||---
---||Business||Axis Bank as promoter brings stability: Max Life||MUMBAI: Axis Bank becoming a promoter of Max Life has reduced the pressure on the life insurance company to diversify its distribution channel. The private lender accounts for 55-60% of the insurer’s sales and this was creating pressure on Max Life to ensure certainty of relationship. Speaking to TOI, Max Life MD & CEO Prashant Tripathy said that the transaction removed uncertainty over third-party distribution channel. Axis Bank as a promoter makes the private lender a permanent, stable distribution channel. Axis Bank has been distributing Max Life’s products for almost a decade. Tripathy said that with this bancassurance partnership becoming a joint venture, there will be deeper tech integration and use of analytics-based technology. “Those with deep domain expertise in investment, people & technology and solid track record of retail financial services are going to participate in our board,” he said. Axis Bank became a co-promoter of Max Life following the private lender’s acquisition of a 13% stake in the life insurance company this week. Max Life’s board will be recast with three Axis Bank nominees. Further, Axis Bank entities will have the right to acquire another 7% in the private insurer. In February 2020, the partners had announced that Axis Bank and its two subsidiaries — Axis Capital and Axis Securities — collectively own a 12.99% stake in Max Life. The life insurer will carry a tag line stating that it is a Max Financial and Axis Bank JV. In the last five years, Max Life has been expanding 18-20% year-on-year and in the first 11 months of FY21, despite Covid, the company recorded 14% growth in individual new business. This, at a time when the private industry recorded negative growth. The company has been growing its share of premium from the sale of protection policy, which already accounts for 10% of the premium. A large chunk of the protection covers is sold online with 12% of the total premium coming from online sales and half from the company’s website.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/axis-as-promoter-brings-stability-max-life/articleshow/81976916.cms||Mayur Shetty

Nitish, who is also a member of the high-level committee, attended the meeting through videoconferencing from here. PM Modi said a number of activities would be organised throughout the year across the country to mark the 400th birth anniversary of Guru Tegh Bahadur. Guru Tegh Bahadur’s 400th birth anniversary falls on April 18, 2021, but the celebration would continue for a year till April 18, 2022 at many places across the country, including Patna Sahib. Guru Tegh Bahadur had arrived in Patna via Sasaram and Gaya on his way to Bengal and Assam. While leaving for Assam, he had asked his mother, Mata Nanaki, and wife Mata Gujri to stay in Patna. His son Guru Gobind Singh, who later became the tenth Sikh guru, was born in Patna in 1966, while Tegh Bahadur was away in Dhubri in Assam. The Patna Sahib Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (PSGPC) has decided to celebrate 400th birth anniversary of Guru Tegh Bahadur in a grand way. “As the celebration would continue for a year, the Patna Sahib Gurdwara has decided to observe Guru Tegh Bahadur’s 400th anniversary on January 4 to 6 in 2022,” PSGPC general secretary Sardar Mahendra Pal Singh said. Singh said the PSGPC has submitted a detailed programme to the Bihar government on the three-day-long celebrations. “We want to celebrate it as grand as we celebrated 350th birth anniversary of tenth Sikh Guru Gobind Singh in Patna a few years back,” Singh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-participates-in-pms-meet-on-guru-tegh-bahadur-birth-anniv/articleshow/81974702.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Business||Anil Agarwal may see Vedanta stake rise to 65% from 55%||MUMBAI: Metals and mining magnate Anil Agarwal will see his stake in flagship Vedanta increase to 65.2% from the existing 55.1%, if he accepts all the shares tendered by minority shareholders in the open offer that closed on Wednesday. The 67-year-old Agarwal had offered to buy 17.5% of Vedanta from public shareholders in what was his latest attempt to tighten his grip over the India-listed entity. Minority shareholders tendered 37.4 crore Vedanta shares as against the 65.1 crore Agarwal had offered to purchase, stock exchange data revealed. The 65.2% stake in Vedanta will take Agarwal’s total promoter shareholding closer to 90%, a threshold he requires to take the company private. India’s capital market rules state that a promoter can delist the company from the stock exchanges if s/he acquires 90% of the total equity capital. Last October, Agarwal had attempted to take Vedanta private but minority investors spoiled his plans. LIC, the largest non-promoter shareholder of Vedanta, quoted a price of Rs 320 apiece as against Agarwal’s indicative delisting price of Rs 87.5. LIC’s quote subsequently became the discovered price for the delisting process, impacting Agarwal’s plans. Agarwal, ranked 47 in Forbes’ India rich list, then came out with an open offer to acquire up to 10% of Vedanta from public shareholders at Rs 160 apiece. He later sweetened the scheme by offering to acquire 17.5% of Vedanta at Rs 235 a share. In October 2018, Agarwal had delisted Vedanta Resources from the London Stock Exchange. The open offer for the Indian company was made by Vedanta Resources. Agarwal, according to Bloomberg News, wants to access Vedanta’s cash to retire his $7-billion debt housed in a private holding company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/agarwal-may-see-vedanta-stake-rise-to-65-from-55/articleshow/81976990.cms||---

Gujarat saw 14 people test positive every five minutes while 35 people succumbed to the virus. This was a 10-month high mortality -- last time the daily deaths were in 30s was in the first half of June 2020. On Thursday, the state’s mortality rate was 0.9%, a major jump from 0.6% in 24 hours. All four major cities recorded yet another peak with Ahmedabad topping the tally at 951 (18% rise in a day), Surat at 723 (16% rise in a day), Rajkot at 427 (8% rise in a day) and Vadodara at 379 (8% rise in a day). Share of the four cities in the state’s tally was 62%. As the active cases rose to 20,473, the health infrastructure gasped for essentials. While beds and Remdesevir injections continued to remain scarce, most alarming was oxygen shortage reported by many hospitals. Highly placed sources said that on Thursday, oxygen requirement was reported at 336 MT against the peak of 240 MT reported at the peak of corona pandemic last year. Hospitals operating on oxygen cylinders that need refill were most affected. For instance, Shifa Hospital in Jamalpur sent out an SOS for oxygen on Thursday after the hospital's supplier declined oxygen citing severe shortage of oxygen and its cylinders. “We had 28 patients admitted and had to run for oxygen in the middle of Wednesday night. We need 100 cylinders against which we could manage 15-20 from others.” Dr Manish Bhatnagar of ICON Hospital, a Covid-19 designated facility in Vastrapur, said they are reeling under oxygen scarcity since the past three days. “With Covid-19 critical patients needing high flow oxygen, we require 80-100 jumbo cylinders a day. However, supply is erratic citing high demand. We have written to the AMC flagging the issue as currently we are forced to beg and borrow oxgen cylinders from other hospitals to ensure uninterrupted flow to patients,” said Dr Bhatnagar. Gujarat Food and Drug Control Administration (FDCA) chief HG Koshia said oxygen shortage was reported by mid-size hospitals using cylinders due to logistics issue. But the government has immediately directed a large chunk of oxygen meant for industrial purposes to be directed to the hospitals. The crisis will be resolved in a day,” Koshia said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guj-gasps-for-oxygen-as-covidexplodes-breaching-4k-cases/articleshow/81976560.cms||---

Offices have also been urged to bring back rostering so that employees can attend office on alternate days to reduce crowding. The state irrigation department has already issued a notice on 50% attendance from Friday and other government offices are likely to follow suit. The state home department may issue a fresh list of protocols soon. Acting on instructions from Union health ministry to tighten Covid norms, the state is set to ramp up testing. With cases declining since the beginning of February, RT-PCR test count had also dipped in recent months. The state has asked KMC to increase vigil and sanitization efforts at municipal markets and introduce steps to prevent crowding and enforce wearing of masks with help of cops. Police will be instructed to be vigilant on crowds in public places. But, crowd control will continue to be a challenge till polls are over. A section of the city goes to polls on Saturday. With polls also scheduled on April 22 and 29 for two city areas, rallies will be a cause for concern.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/offices-told-to-reinforce-cov-protocol/articleshow/81976851.cms||Saikat Ray

The police have launched a manhunt to nab three other absconding accused. According to reports, the 50-year-old property dealer Narayan Dutt Tiwari alias Guddu Tirawi, a resident of Akhari village was sprayed with bullets near a brick kiln in Rohaniya area on April 5 night. He was returning from Shooltankeshwar temple when the assailants stopped him and started indiscriminate fire on him. They fled from the scene after committing the crime. The local residents rushed to the spot after hearing the gun shot and saw Tiwari lying on the ground with multiple bullet injuries. They immediately informed the police and his family members. The police rushed Tiwari to the Trauma Centre of Banaras Hindu University, where he succumbed to injuries in course of treatment. The Rohaniya SHO Pravin Kumar said that an FIR was lodged against five persons including Neeraj Pandey, Dheeraj Pandey, Dayanad Pandey, all residents of Kurahua, and two unidentified persons under sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 302 (murder), 504 (intentionally insults, and thereby gives provocation to any person) and 34 (a criminal act done by several persons) of IPC.

---||Business||CSR spends can earn GST input tax credit: AAR||Mumbai: The UP bench of the Authority of Advance Ruling (AAR) has ruled that corporate social responsibility (CSR) expenses are incurred by a company in the course of business and are eligible for input tax credit under goods and services tax (GST) regulations. It pointed out that CSR expenditure is incurred in order to comply with the requirements of the Companies Act, 2013. This ruling, which distinguishes between goods given voluntarily as ‘gifts’ and those that are part of CSR activities, provides much relief to companies engaged in litigation on the issue of input tax credit, or ITC. The ruling will strengthen the case of companies providing free goods as part of their CSR activities. While advance rulings do not set a judicial precedent, they do have a persuasive effect in the course of assessments. The UP bench of the AAR gave the ruling in the case of Dwarikesh Sugar Industries, which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of sugar and allied products. In order to comply with its CSR obligations, the company undertook the construction of school buildings, additional rooms, and labs. It also supplied for free various goods such as furniture and electrical equipment for use in the schools. In other words, for carrying out its CSR activities, it purchased goods on which GST was levied. The moot question was whether input tax credit would be available against its final GST liability, for the GST paid by it, in procuring such goods. The AAR answered in the affirmative, but with a caveat. It pointed out that input tax credit of goods and services used for construction of the school building would not be available to the extent these have been capitalised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/csr-spends-can-earn-gst-input-tax-credit-aar/articleshow/81976970.cms||---

Justice Rajeev Ranjan Prasad passed a detailed judgment on Wednesday, directing the state government to shift the eight-member special investigation team, including the current Munger SP, to some other place within three days to ensure a free and fair investigation. The CID will now investigate the case. The court observed that the order to shift the SIT elsewhere must not be seen as an indictment of those officers, and no adverse inference shall be drawn against them. The court observed that the investigation by Munger police didn’t progress with the desired pace and precision. The court further observed that the CID must get an opportunity to act freely, collect evidence and submit its first report in a sealed cover within four weeks for the next hearing. The court didn’t agree to a CBI inquiry observing that there was no strong material present that CID will not investigate the case against police personnel in a free and fair manner. However, the court has given the liberty to the petitioner, Amar Nath Poddar, the slain youth’s father, to point out to the court if the investigation is not progressing in a natural direction or if it is biased or influenced by any person. Petitioner had pleaded for a CBI inquiry in his son’s death in the alleged police firing along with compensation of Rs 5 crore. The high court also gave the liberty to CID ADG to take over all connected cases if required to maintain uniformity and consistency in the investigation into the youth’s killing. The HC also directed the ADGP to decide on constituting a special investigation team as per requirement and he will also constitute a team consisting of police officers above the rank of DSP whenever required to interrogate police personnel for investigation. On the assurance of advocate general Lalit Kishore, the bench also directed that CID ADG Vinay Kumar shall not be transferred anywhere else in the course of the investigation. The court has also ordered the state government to pay Rs 10 lakh to the petitioner as compensation within one month. The petitioner can claim further compensation against the wrongdoers. Supreme Court advocate Alakh Alok Srivastava, assisted by Manas Prakash, were appearing pro bono for the petitioner, while advocate general Lalit Kishore, additional advocate general Anjani Kumar, government pleader Nadim Seraj, assisted by Shailesh Kumar and Shailendra Kumar Singh, were appearing for the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-to-monitor-cid-probe-in-munger-case/articleshow/81957319.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Representatives of different private schools handed over separate memorandums to Nalanda DM Yogendra Kumar Singh and Sheikhpura DM Enayat Khan on Thursday, urging them to take up the matter with the state government so that schools are reopened after April 11 in the interest of students, teachers, management and other staff members. Over 200 representatives of private schools from Nalanda, Sheikhpura and Nawada districts had met at Biharsharif on Wednesday. President of Bhartiya Swatantra Shikshak Sangh Kaushlendra Kumar alias Bharat Manas said online education did not yield desired results during lockdown. “Teachers of government schools get their salaries even during closure. However, private schools find it difficult to pay teachers and other staff if the educational institutions are closed. It is surprising that the government has not shut down malls, markets and other public places yet. Only schools are being closed and told to follow Covid protocols,” Manas added.

Serial entrepreneur Beerud Sheth, co-founder and CEO of Gupshup said the investment will help them meet rising demand for conversational experiences in business to customer interactions and they chose to go for it rather than having an operational cash flow need. “The pandemic has accelerated digital communications by businesses, and messaging platforms have emerged as the new digital storefront,” Sheth said.

There has been no violation of Sebi’s takeover regulations and the promoters have complied with applicable laws, RIL said in a stock exchange filing. The promoters informed RIL that they will appeal to SAT and they remain confident of vindicating their position, RIL added in the filing. Sebi had imposed a fine of Rs 25 crore collectively on multiple promoter entities including Ambani and his wife Nita for not complying with takeover norms in an RIL share issue that dates back to 2000. The promoter entities had raised their stake in RIL by 6.8% by subscribing to its equity shares. According to Sebi, rules require promoter entities to make an open offer to minority investors if they acquire more than 5% in the company. RIL said that it had issued debentures with convertible warrants in 1994 and allotted equity shares against the warrants in 2000. “Sebi had issued a show-cause notice in February 2011 (more than 11 years after acquisition of shares) to the then promoter group (as in the year 2000) alleging violation of its takeover regulations,” RIL’s statement read. In the event the promoter entities fail to pay the fine within 45 days of the receipt of the Sebi order, the regulator had said that it would initiate actions to recover the amount along with interest by attachment and sale of movable and immovable properties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mukesh-ambani-to-move-sat-against-sebi-fine/articleshow/81976982.cms||---

The state was following the ‘test, trace and treat’ protocol to identify Covid patients and isolating them at the earliest so that the chain of transmission could be broken. The state, the PM was informed, was also focussing on increasing testing and vaccinations for four districts of Lucknow, Kanpur, Prayagraj and Varanasi which had accounted for 50% of the over 8,400 cases reported in UP on Thursday. The PM has asked all states to hold a Vaccine Utsav from April 11, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Jyotiba Phule, to April 14, the birth anniversary of Dr BR Ambedkar. During this time, UP, along with other states, will have to ramp up vaccinations, look at targeted vaccinations for various groups and create awareness among people about Covid-19 and why vaccination is essential. Yogi will hold a video conference with all mayors and councillors ahead of this utsav so that there is better coordination for its roll out. An all-party meeting will be convened by Governor Anandiben Patel so that even Opposition party leaders and members are on the same page as the government and can assist in increasing the reach of vaccinations. The CM informed the PM that UP had increased vaccinations and so far, more than 80 lakh people had been vaccinated. On April 5, the state inoculated more than 5 lakh people while on other days, an average of 3.5-4 lakh doses were being administered. The state had also carried out over 2 lakh tests on Wednesday, the highest in the country. UP has 125 government labs and 104 private labs which are carrying out the tests, he said. Yogi Adityanath said that ventilator beds are available in all districts and there are 50,000 ventilator beds available in the state right now. A virtual ICU facility is also functional where consultation from specialists in other hospitals and cities is being sought for critical patients. There are 59,000 nigrani samities active in rural areas and 14,000 in urban area which are keeping an eye on people coming from other states and those under quarantine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-shortage-of-beds-medicines-or-manpower-in-state-yogi-tells-pm/articleshow/81978345.cms||Neha Lalchandani

An NCB team led by zonal director Sameer Wankhede on Tuesday had nabbed Danish in Kota district, Rajasthan, in connection with a drug syndicate. His name came up during the interrogation of Ibrahim’s aides Chinku Pathan and Arif Bhujwala, who were arrested by NCB last month. Officials said Danish was the son of Yusuf Merchant alias Yusuf Chikna, a Dongri gangster with ties to the Dawood gang in the 1980s-90s. NCB had raided a drug laboratory in Dongri last month and had arrested Rafiq Shaikh and seized codeine cough syrup. Shaikh claimed he used to work for Danish, who was suspected of running the operation, but had fled to Rajasthan. At the time of arrest, Danish had 200gm of hashish on him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ncb-to-produce-dawood-aide-in-court-today/articleshow/81978358.cms||S Ahmed Ali
---||Patna||Patna University to revamp its vocational courses||PATNA: Patna University (PU) has, of late, initiated necessary steps for strengthening all its self-financing (vocational) courses and enhancing placement opportunities for the passouts. The ordinance and regulations of different courses would be amended and the feasibility of starting new programmes keeping in view the present employment scenario would also be studied. PU vocational courses’ chief coordinator Birendra Prasad told this newspaper on Thursday that the course coordinators of different self-financing courses, running both at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, have been directed to examine the course intake capacity. “They have also been asked to check the viability of old courses in the modern context and send a detailed report to the university,” Prasad said. The chief coordinator pointed out that the various issues relating to the enhancement of utility of self-financing courses were discussed at a recent meeting of the programme directors and course coordinators with the PU vice-chancellor, G K Choudhary. “It was decided that all the self-financing courses will frame uniform criteria of admission, examination, results, fee structure and number of papers in each semester,” Prasad added. It was found that the students of different disciplines and faculties were admitted to the same academic programme like MA in personnel management and industrial relations (PMIR), MA in rural management, MA in social work and MA in mass communications and journalism. “The nomenclature of the course should not be confined to one discipline. Rather the new name should be Masters in PMIR,” the chief coordinator said, adding that the nomenclature of all such courses will be changed so that students doing these courses do not suffer at the time of their placement. However, some undergraduate students have faced problems in getting jobs due to different nomenclature of the same course as BA in computer applications and BSc in computer applications. “The nomenclature of both these courses will now be changed as Bachelor of computer applications (BCA),” Prasad said. Mathematics or statistics at +2 stage would be one of the minimum eligibility criteria for admission to the BCA course. Meanwhile, the programme directors and course coordinators have been asked to activate the placement process. “Colleges and postgraduate departments will maintain the record of such placement. Each college will have a separate placement cell with a placement coordinator for its proper functioning,” Prasad said and added that each department or college would conduct an academic audit of self-financing courses at regular intervals and procure students’ feedback in each session.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-university-to-revamp-its-vocational-courses/articleshow/81974582.cms||B K Mishra

Station house officer (SHO) of Kurtha police station Dinesh Bahadur Singh was honoured with the certificate of ‘Best Police Station, 2020’ by DGP Sanjeev Kumar Singhal here on Thursday. The certificate had been issued by the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA). Kurtha police station was selected for the award from among the 16,000 police stations in the country where an MHA team conducted a survey in November last year. Gandhi Maidan police station in Patna and Dhanarua police station in rural Patna were also in the race. However, the feedback received from the people about policing, response time after an incident of crime, behaviour with visitors, sanitation, toilets, police barracks and above all people’s perception about the police left other police stations behind in the race. Finally, Kurtha police station, which was witness to a series of massacres in the late 90s, bagged the award. The message was conveyed to the senior police officers of the state police headquarters by the MHA a couple of days ago. SHO Singh said teamwork led to this achievement for the police station. He said the award has inspired each staff of the police station to try and improve their performance. Arun Kumar, who earlier officiated as incharge of the Kurtha police station, recalled that there was a time when no police officer would want to be posted there due to Maoist activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/arwals-kurtha-police-station-adjudged-states-best-thana/articleshow/81974769.cms||---

---||Patna||Bihar: 2 wks after rape survivor’s death, convict gets 10yrs in jail||PATNA: Almost a fortnight after a rape survivor got killed in a road accident, a special court in Patna awarded 10 years rigorous imprisonment to the convict, Sonu Kumar (28), after holding him guilty of sexually exploiting the girl on the pretext of marriage. The special POCSO court of ADJ-VI Awadhesh Kumar ordered Rs 10 lakh compensation to the rape survivor's two-year-old son fathered by the convict. The court also imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on Sonu. The special public prosecutor (POSCO Act), Suresh Chandra Prasad, said the survivor was a minor at the time she was sexually exploited several times by the convict. Prasad said it was via newspaper reports that the court came to know that the woman was killed in a road accident on March 21 this year and an FIR in connection with her death was registered with the Traffic police station at Saguna Mor in Danapur, Patna. “The convict had eloped with the minor girl in November 2015. He took her to his sister’s residence at Hajipur in Vaishali. Sonu later denied to keep the girl or marry her after his sister came to know about his acts,” Prasad said. He said an FIR was registered by the then minor girl against Sonu for sexually exploiting her on multiple occasions promising to marry her, with Phulwarisharif police station in Patna on November 4, 2015. He said the convict was around 23 years old in 2015 when he had sexually exploited her. “Sonu and the victim later filed a compromise petition before the court and even married each other. The victim had turned hostile in the course of the trial after filing the compromise petition,” he said. The PP said both of them were kicked out of their homes by their respective parents and they together started living in Hajipur. He said the convict later again refused to keep her as his wife and kicked her out of his accommodation in Hajipur. “She started to live alone in Patna. In 2018, she even gave birth to a male child while continuing to live alone until she got tragically killed in a road accident on March 21,” the prosecutor said. The PP said the victim had approached the court multiple times after Sonu denied to accept her. Prasad said it was the victim’s father who had supported the case strongly which was the major ground of Sonu’s conviction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/2-wks-after-rape-survivors-death-convict-gets-10yrs-in-jail/articleshow/81974842.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Man beheaded in Nawada, body dumped on riverbank||PATNA: Police have recovered the beheaded body of a 32-year-old man from the left bank of Sakri river near Govindpur in Nawada on Thursday. He had gone missing on Wednesday evening. The deceased Ajay Kumar was from Maheshpur village located on the opposite side of the river from where his body was recovered. He worked at a petrol pump at Lakhpat Bigha in Baksauti village which is around two kilometres from his home in Maheshpur. Govindpur SHO Narendra Prasad said Kumar went missing around 6 pm on Wednesday. “He had not returned home at night. His family members were looking for him. However, they informed the police only on Thursday morning that Kumar was missing,” he said. Prasad said within hours of police receiving the missing report, information was received that a mutilated body was lying on the riverbank opposite the victim's village. “Police reached the spot and the body was identified to be that of Kumar. Family members also ascertained the identity,” he said. SHO Prasad said Kumar was beheaded. “Only a small part of the head was connected to the rest of the body. The rest of the neck region was slashed open. It seems a heavy sharp-edged weapon must have been used in the beheading,” he said. The SHO said it seems he was murdered somewhere else after which the body was dumped at the spot. “Police have detained two suspects in connection with the murder. However, nothing concrete has surfaced yet. His family members also have no suspect,” he said. Prasad said his cellphone and other belongings were perhaps taken away by the killers. “Only the clothes he was wearing were on the body. Police suspect that some persons from nearby areas are involved in the killing,” he said, adding police are awaiting call records to know with whom Kumar had interacted the last time and what was his location. He said the body has been handed over to the family after conducting a post mortem examination at the Nawada Sadar hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/man-beheaded-in-nawada-body-dumped-on-riverbank/articleshow/81974792.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Kolkata||Remdesivir numbers dwindle across Kolkata pvt hospitals||KOLKATA: Private hospitals across Kolkata have been facing a shortage of Remdesivir — the principal Covid drug used on patients with moderate to severe symptoms, including those on oxygen. Even as the number of Covid patients continue to rise sharply, several hospitals have been running out of stock over the last few days and some were forced to borrow from other hospitals. The crisis was triggered by a sudden slump in supply that has resulted from a diversion of Remdesivir to the worst-affected states, said a section of suppliers. The Dhakuria unit of AMRI Hospitals had run out of Remdesivir earlier this week. While the hospital had 47 Covid patients then, 40 of them needed the drug. “We somehow managed to acquire some. On Thursday, we received 50 doses and are supposed to get 50 more on Friday. But this slow supply is not enough to cater to patients,” said an AMRI spokesperson. A consignment of the drug that is administered to Covid patients for five consecutive days reached Kolkata on Thursday. But the size of the consignment — just 1,260 doses — was inadequate. A patient at a south Kolkata private hospital who was supposed to receive her third dose on Tuesday had to skip it as the hospital ran out of Remdesivir. Hospital authorities are exchanging frantic messages on their WhatsApp groups, keeping track of each others’ stocks and seeking replenishment from each other. Belle Vue Clinic said its stock has been thin for several days and the authorities are worried since the number of Covid patients has gone up sharply. “We have 83 Covid patients and several require the drug. Supplies have slowed with the rise in cases across Maharashtra, Karnataka and Punjab. Our suppliers say that the bulk of the drug is going to these states. We are keeping fingers crossed,” said CEO P Tondon. He added that two other hospitals owned by the Belle Vue group in Rajasthan and Jharkhand were facing a similar shortage. Peerless Hospital was supposed to receive 80 vials on Thursday, but received only half that quantity. “We have more than 35 Covid patients now and around six of them need the drug. Four of our suppliers have stopped providing Remdesivir. Our stocks will last two more days and we will have a crisis if fresh stock doesn’t reach us by then,” said CEO Sudipta Mitra. There is no suitable alternative to Remdesivir, according to doctors. “It has to be administered early to moderate and severe patients. This is why it’s important to have enough stock. At this stage, we are not sure if the requirement will rise sharply over the next few days,” said Belle Vue internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/remdesivir-nos-dwindle-across-city-pvt-hospitals/articleshow/81976859.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Those who want to take their money out will get it on the pre-scheduled date of closure, while those who wish to continue to invest will have to send applications to the fund house for rollover. The FMPs, which are closed-ended schemes with a fixed date of maturity, were launched in January 2018 and are set to close this month. The fund house is giving this option to its FMP investors since existing investors have already made good money in these funds because of the rally in bond prices last year and can now enjoy some more indexation benefits if they decide to continue their investments in the same schemes. The options are being given at a time when alternate investment options are available at low rate of interest, A Balasubramanian, CEO, Aditya Birla MF, said. According to mutual fund distributors, the fund house is extending the schemes at an expected rate of about 4.65% and the same quality of papers in its portfolio, which are mostly AAA, for this extension but with investors’ consent. Investors will get the indexation benefits for this period. None of the papers in the portfolios of these FMPs have any issue, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/birla-mf-gives-rollover-option-in-six-fixed-maturity-plans/articleshow/81976856.cms||---

In its order, the court of civil judge (senior division), fast track, Ashutosh Tiwai directed the Director General of Archaeological Survey of India to get a comprehensive archaeological survey of the entire Gyanvapi compound done. The court directed the ASI DG to constitute a five-member committee of eminent persons who are experts and well-versed in the science of archaeology, two of which should preferably belong to the minority community. In its order, the court also directed the DG to appoint an eminent and highly-experienced person, who can be regarded as expert in the science of archaeology, to act as observer. “Such person should preferably be a scholarly personality and established academician of any central university,” it said. The five-member committee shall submit a report of its survey work to the observer on a daily basis. The court further said the committee shall prepare comprehensive documentation along with the drawing, plan, elevation, site map with precise breadth and width of the disputed site, marked with hatched lines in the plaint map. “The purpose of the archaeological survey shall be to find out as to whether the religious structure standing at the present and disputed site is a superimposition, alteration or addition or there is structural overlapping of any kind. If so, then what exactly is the age, size, monumental and architectural design or style of the religious structure, and what material has been used for building the same,” the court said. The committee shall also trace as to whether any temple belonging to the Hindu community ever existed before the mosque in question was built or superimposed or added upon it at the disputed site. For that purpose, the committee shall be entitled to enter into every portion of the religious structure. The committee shall firstly resort to Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) or Geo-Radiology System or both to satisfy itself as to whether any excavation or extraction work is needed in any portion. The excavation should be done by trial trench method vertically on a very small scale, and horizontal excavation shall be done only when the committee is fully satisfied of being able to reach a more concrete conclusion regarding the archaeological remains below the ground. Advocate Vijay Shankar Rastogi, as the ‘next friend’ of Swayambhu Jyotirlinga Bhagwan Vishweshwar, had filed an application in the court of civil judge in December 2019, requesting for survey of the entire Gyanvapi compound by the ASI. In January 2020, Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Committee had filed an objection against the petition. The first petition was filed in Varanasi civil court in 1991 seeking permission for worship in Gyanvapi. The petitioner had contended that Kashi Vishwanath Temple was built by Maharaja Vikramaditya about 2,050 years ago, but Mughal emperor Aurangzeb destroyed the temple in 1664 and used its remains to construct a mosque, which is known as Gyanvapi masjid, on a portion of the temple land. The petitioner had requested the court to issue directions for removal of the mosque from temple land and give back its possession to the temple trust. The petition contended that the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act was not applicable on the suit as the mosque was constructed over a partly demolished temple and many parts of the temple exist even today. In 1998, Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Committee moved the high court contending the mandir-masjid dispute could not be adjudicated by a civil court as it was barred by law. The high court then stayed the proceedings in lower court. In February 2020, the petitioners approached the lower court again to resume hearing as the HC had not extended the stay in the past six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/court-orders-asi-surveyof-gyanvapi-compound/articleshow/81975459.cms||---

The Association of Mutual Funds’ chief executive NS Venkatesh people are trying to gauge which way the gold price will move.

Interacting with the district panchayati raj officers, sub-divisional officers and block development officers via videoconferencing, secretary of the commission, Yogendra Ram, said it was necessary to make the reserved seats online at the panchayat level to avoid any trouble. “Reservation norms will be followed on the basis of the previous panchayat polls held in 2016. The seats were reserved for different categories on the basis of the 2011 census report,” Ram clarified while assessing the arrangements for the forthcoming panchayat polls. Of the 8,286 posts of mukhiya in the state, 3,772 seats are reserved for women. Similarly, 1,388 seats are reserved for SCs. Of these, 562 are reserved for women. Likewise, 92 seats are reserved for ST, of which 21 are reserved for women. Of the 1,441 seats for OBCs, 585 are reserved for women. The polls are to be held for the posts of district board member, mukhiya, sarpanch, ward member, panch and panchayat samiti member. However, the schedule of the election is yet to be announced by the election commission. Ram also expressed his displeasure over the “callous attitude” of the DMs of Araria, Kishanganj, West Champaran, Gaya, Rohtas, Banka and Jamui in identifying the shadow zone polling booths under their jurisdiction. They were told to adhere to the directive of the commission and submit their reports at the earliest. “The report will help us make special arrangements for communication at the polling booths falling under the shadow zone,” a senior official of the commission told this reporter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/digitise-reserved-seats-at-panchayat-level-ec/articleshow/81974643.cms||Ramashankar

By the end of the day’s vaccination programme, we could be left with about 10 lakh doses, which could see us through for three days at the most. If we do not get fresh stock within these three days, we may run out of vaccine given the kind of numbers we have scaled up,” said a senior health official. State health department officials requisitioned more vaccines during a meeting with the health ministry officials on Thursday. “The stocks need to be replenished within the next two-three days,” an official said. So far, Bengal has received 85,74,200 doses (74 lakh-plus Covishield and 11 lakh-plus Covaxin), the last consignment having arrived on April 2. Till Wednesday, 70,55,520 doses had been used to inoculate people, officially. But health officials said the actual number could be slightly higher due to data backlog in the Co-WIN system. “A few days ago, Bengal was allotted a fresh consignment of 21 lakh doses of Covishield on paper. But this lot will not arrive before April 15, which is still about a week away,” said a source at Swasthya Bhawan. At present, over 2.5 lakh doses are being administered daily across vaccination centres in the state. On Monday, a whopping 4.4 lakh people were inoculated, followed by 3.1 lakh the next day. State health department officials said they could have scaled up the number of recipients to 5 lakh a day if it were not for the state of the current vaccine stock. “We have already flagged our concern that we may face a vaccine shortage if the stock does not get replenished in the next two-to-three days. We are hopeful of a stop-gap solution with temporary allotment,” said state family welfare officer Ashim Das Malakar. Of the about 14 lakh doses left, only 15,000 doses of Covaxin are currently in the custody of the Bagbazar central vaccine depot, the rest having been sent to cold-chain points or district vaccine stores. “In all likelihood, we might get a shipment by Friday or Saturday, but we have no idea about the quantity. The job does not end at receiving the consignment. It has to be brought to the Bagbazar depot to be sorted and sent to the different districts, which needs time. We hope to get a shipment by Friday,” said a source at the health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-jabs-3l-a-day-has-10l-plus-vax-doses-left/articleshow/81976597.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The decision was taken in view of the large influx of pilgrims who are expected to visit Haridwar for the Maha Kumbh Festival. The HNBGU officials told TOI that the decision was taken in interest of the students as it is quite risky for them to travel during the Maha Kumbh Festival, especially when Covid-19 cases are on a rise.

---||Delhi||Two illegal call centres busted in outer Delhi, 20 in police net||New Delhi: The outer district police have busted two fake call centres, which were allegedly duping people on the pretext of selling expensive phones at cheap rates and providing work during Covid-19, respectively. Twenty people have been arrested, police said. In the first case, the accused were duping people on the pretext of selling phones at a discounted rate. They were operating from an illegal call centre in Mangolpuri. According to Parvinder Singh, (DCP outer), twelve people, including eight women employees, have been arrested. “A person named Krishan was running the call centre with the help of three male and eight female employees,” the DCP said. “His telecallers would dial random numbers and ask people if they were interested in buying a particular phone worth Rs 20,000 for Rs 4,000. If any victim agreed and placed an order with them, they would send a plastic phone packed as a new phone,” the DCP added. When the cops raided another office in Nangloi, they found two men — Ajim Ali and Afzal Mirza -- allegedly running a racket with the help of six female telecallers. The accused were found involved in making lucrative job offers to prospective victims through telephonic calls, WhatsApp chat and emails. “To avoid suspicion, they kept the amount asked for verification, etc to the minimum— from 1,000 to 3,000 rupees per victim. They thought that for such a low amount, victims were unlikely to complain,” DCP Singh said. Their modus operandi was to call random numbers through telecallers and put up home/online job offers with remuneration of up to Rs 2,000 per day. If the called person agreed, they would ask for money for verification and final placement. Once the money was transferred to their account, there would be no further contact.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/two-illegal-call-centres-busted-in-outer-delhi-20-in-police-net/articleshow/81977074.cms||---
---||Goa||Taxi operators’ strike evokes partial response||Panaji: The call given by taxi operators for a day long strike to demand for scrapping of GoaMiles, the state-backed app-based taxi service, evoked partial response with many continuing with their operation. Barring a few, tourists, could reach their destinations without any hassle from both the airport and railway stations as taxi service was available there. While the taxi union said they will continue with the stir, the authorities have cancelled the permission given to them for a protest at Azad Maidan, Panaji, for violation of SOPs for Covid. Thursday was the third day they had been assembling in hundreds to press for their demand. The taxi operators went on strike a day after the transport minister asserted that there was no question of withdrawing GoaMiles which was started in 2018. While most of the North Goa taxi operators kept their vehicles off the road, many in South Goa kept vehicles running. Many who didn’t join the strike said they will support their union on Friday. “We don’t want cab aggregators in Goa. We had given an ultimatum to the government. We want GoaMiles to be scrapped, only then we will discuss matters,” a taxi association head Laximan Korgaonkar said. Taxi operator Chetan Kamat said that Goa is not a metro city so running cab aggregators was not necessary and that “taxi operators from North to South Goa” will gather at the Azad Maidan in protest. The taxi operators have warned that they will not go for digital meters unless the GoaMIles service is scrapped. Transport minister Mauvin Godinho said that “better sense must prevail” among the taxi owners. “No government will give in to such a demand. This is like holding a gun to the head and telling us to act on this. It is the government’s business to decided how to go about having an aggregator for the state. It is not the case that the existing operators should run the taxi business. We have been sympathetic towards them by waiving off taxes, penalties and now fixing digital meters for free,” he said. Godinho said that he will be calling them to discuss the installation of digital meters and revision of fares wherein the issue of GoaMiles will also be addressed. “The way they are behaving, they will only delay things for themselves. They must come to the negotiating table and we can sort out the problems. Even if they want to achieve something, this is not an approach to attaining success in their demand,” he said. While so far tourists have not been stranded in the state due to the disruption of taxi services, the transport minister said that buses of the Kadamba Transport Corporation Ltd (KTC) and yellow and black taxis will come to the aid of people in such a scenario.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/taxi-operators-strike-evokes-partial-response/articleshow/81978370.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Breaking all previous records, UP records 8,490 fresh cases of coronavirus||LUCKNOW: Breaking all previous records, 8,490 fresh cases of coronavirus were recorded in the past 24 hours in Uttar Pradesh. The number surpassed the previous peak recorded in the state on September 11 with 7,042 cases. Experts are concerned over two things. One, the new peak of 8,490 cases is already 20% higher than the previous one. Two, the number of new cases is doubling very fast. In fact, cases went up from around 4,000 to 8,000 in just four days.The new cases took state’s tally to 6.54 lakh on Thursday. Of the total cases, 6,06,063 have recovered, including 1,084 in the past 24 hours. Also, the death toll for state crossed 9,000 mark with 39 more deaths. The surge in new cases reflected on the number of active infections which went up from about 31,000 on Wednesday to 39,338 on Thursday. Officials said the total active cases, 16,434, were in hospitals while the others were under home isolation. Assessment of data indicated that 50% of the new cases came from just four districts — Lucknow, Prayagraj, Varanasi and Kanpur Nagar. Data shows that 37,210 cases were reported in UP between April 1- 8, of which 19,872 cases are from these four districts. Lucknow leads with 10,068 cases, followed by Prayagraj 4,396, Varanasi 3,565 and Kanpur 1,843 cases. Calling the surge ‘unprecedented’ and ‘unfortunate’, experts associated the increase to failure of people to adhere to the Covid-19 preventions like wearing mask and social distancing. Some of them also attributed to lack of strictness by local administration to penalise people violating the protocols. “The rise is alarming. Unless everyone joins the battle against the virus, the system will get distressed and finally collapse as even doctors and nurses are falling sick. Everyone will have to take the responsibility of one and ones closed one to keep trouble at bay,” said social activist Dr PK Gupta. Additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said the rise in cases was a cause of concern and in the wake of surge, the testing and surveillance activity has been intensified. “More than two lakh tests were conducted in the past 24 hours and more than 86,000 samples received by the labs for RT PCR tests,” he said. “More than 78 lakh doses of the vaccine have been administered in UP while focused vaccination is underway. Of the doses given, 11.79 lakh targeted beneficiaries have taken both the shots,” he said urging people to shun their fear and take the vaccine in individual and social interest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-has-new-covid-19-peak-with-8490-cases/articleshow/81978356.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Goa||Goa: Classes IX-XII to get new offline exam guidelines||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Thursday said that considering the prevailing Covid-19 conditions in the state, the directorate of education will issue new guidelines for conducting examinations for students from Classes IX to XII in offline mode. “It was earlier decided to hold examinations from Classes IX to XII in offline mode and for rest of the classes in online mode. Based on it, some schools decided to hold examinations in offline mode. But considering the conditions, we are thinking about it and the directorate of education will issue instructions accordingly,” Sawant, who also holds the education portfolio, said. When asked if Goa too would take a decision like Maharashtra to cancel examinations for students up to Class VIII, he said, “Instead of directly promoting students, let them answer the examination in online mode. At least their ability to study will increase.” He said that creating mini containment zones is the alternative available to control the spread of Covid 19. With the increase in number of Covid-19 cases, Sawant said that the bed capacity has increased at the South Goa district hospital, and a Covid care centre has been activited at the ESI hospital in Margao. “We have given emphasis on home isolation, and for that early testing is the only solution. If detected early, we can then isolate the patients,” he said. Sawant said that night curfew won’t help control the spread of the virus. “Being a tourist state, if we implement night curfew then it will have an effect on the tourism industry,” he said. Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi advice, Sawant said that the state government has decided to hold a “Tika Utsav” from April 11 to April 14 to carry out a massive vaccination drive to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The chief minister also said that those who are 45 years of age and above should take the vaccine. Sawant said that Prime Minister Modi ruled out a lockdown as a solution to control the virus. “We have to take precaution to control the spread of Covid-19. We have to wear face masks, maintain social distance and get vaccinated. A lockdown is not a solution,” he said after attending the Prime Minister’s meeting with chief ministers, on Covid. Tika Ustav will be held at various gram panchayats and the list of places will be announced on Friday, Sawant told reporters. He said that Modi urged youths to create awareness about vaccines and Covid-19. “I urge the youths of Goa to create awareness,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/classes-ix-xii-to-get-new-offline-exam-guidelines/articleshow/81978444.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kochi GIS map: Cardiff univ takes crowdsourcing route||Kochi: The University of Cardiff’s Welsh School of Architecture is planning to create a GIS (geographic information system) map of Kochi, by mapping every single buildings and roads in the city with some basic information on them, through crowdsourcing. The Liveable Urbanism design studio at the architecture school, which is behind the project, will be using the map for advanced spatial analysis of Kochi. “This is a very ambitious plan and the team is trying to use the crowdsourcing method to map details of 2,41,000 buildings and 37,000 road segments in Kochi. While we are also hoping to get about 4,000-5,000 responses for each of the social, environmental and economic sections of the survey to do a robust analysis,” said Shibu Raman, lecturer in architecture and urban design at Cardiff University. The design studio is now appealing to the public to help mark the various aspects of the town, which includes the physical environment, on the map using a survey that is open to the public. For the past three academic years, the studio has been working on smart city mission-funded medium-sized cities in India. Since 2019, they have been working in Kochi with the support of the Indian Institute of Architects-Cochin Centre and with SCMS School of Architecture. According to Raman, the studio aims to develop an evidence-driven vision and dynamic urban strategy to make Kochi more sustainable and liveable considering all the social, ecological, economic and spatial complexities. “One of the biggest issues in working with cities on such an ambitious agenda is the availability of data and maps and this becomes even more critical in cities in Global South. Geographically located data normally in the form of a GIS map is fundamental in analytical modelling of cities and in the absence of this, Liveable Urbanism Studio endeavoured to develop their GIS map through a collaborative workshop with local architecture students,” he said. “The next critical step is to map fine-grain data on physical characteristics of the city, environmental, ecological, social, cultural, economic characteristics and travel behaviour. This survey has four distinct sections,” he said. For ease of use, Liveable Urbanism has provided the survey in both Malayalam and English versions, which could be accessed at: https://tinyurl.com/5b5bka8c. “People could also participate in the survey using the QR code on the website,” Raman said. “The design studio team hopes to present their creative ideas and strategies to the city in June or July with a virtual or physical exhibition of the work depending on the travel situation at that time,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kochi-gis-map-cardiff-univ-takes-crowdsourcing-route/articleshow/81975758.cms||Shenoy Karun

She, as an RTE quota student, had studied in a private school till Class VI.It is, however, not clear whether she would be eligible for a medical seat next year, on the basis of her performance in NEET this year. NEET score is valid for the current year only.The case relates to a case filed by Sabhana’s father, stating that she had studied in a private school under RTE quota, Noting that she did Class VII to Class XII in a government school, he said she is eligible for admission under 7.5% quota. He, however, said that while filling the application form, she had marked ‘no’ against a column which asked if she had studied in a government school from Class VI to Class XII.Justice V Parthiban, deciding the case in her favour, said the state ought to have had a separate column for students who studied in private schools under RTE quota. Due to the absence of any specific column for RTE category students, the very valuable right of Sabhana for being considered under 7.5% quota had been cruelly denied to her, said Justice Parthiban, adding: "No amount of consolation from the state authorities could compensate the loss suffered by the petitioner's daughter at the crucial stage of higher educational pursuits.”Observing that the state government is under moral and legal obligation to consider her admission, Justice Parthiban asked the state to explore the possibilities to accommodate the student in this academic year. After being informed of the closure of the admission process, the judge directed the state to reserve a seat for the student and provide her admission next academic year on a priority basis in medical courses in terms of her overall standing in the merit list under 7.5% quota, if she is interested in taking up the course to be offered to her.It was the state’s case that had the student approached the counselling authority , her name could have been included for extension of 7.5% preferential admission this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/reserve-medical-seat-for-rte-student-next-year-hc/articleshow/81978380.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy, however, directed the three officials to deposit the penalty and costs imposed on them with the registry of the high court as a precondition to hear their appeals against the convictions awarded to them in a contempt case filed by two oustees of Mallanna Sagar reservoir. The bench refused to stay the single judge’s order in respect of nullifying 11(2) notification of land acquisition. “You neither gave time to the people to act nor did you seek an extension of time from the court. Your compliance is an eyewash,”the bench said. All the three contemnors were present in the court. The case was posted to August 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-breather-for-collectors-on-jail-term/articleshow/81977114.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The prosecution submitted that the petitioner was a teacher and used to help the girl with her studies. Ramesh called her often and sent voice messages goading her to enter a romantic relationship with him. He attempted to misbehave with the girl once, and the girl was rescued by her mother, it said.When the girl’s mother tried to lodge a harassment complaint with a sub-inspector of police (SI) of the station concerned, no case was registered. Subsequently, she approached the deputy superintendent of police (DSP), no action was taken. Only when the girl informed the Child Helpline, a case was registered.Taking cognizance of the submissions, justice M Nirmal Kumar observed that no action was taken by the SI and DSP despite several directions given to police to register cases immediately in such offences. The lethargic attitude cannot be appreciated, the judge said and directed Virudhunagar DSP to monitor the case probe and file a report on April 19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/court-slams-cops-inaction-over-minors-harassment/articleshow/81978392.cms||---

---||Vadodara||Patients from other dists flood Vadodara||Vadodara: With a steady rise in the number of Covid-19 patients being rushed to the city from neighbouring districts, attempts are being made to ensure that these patients are treated in their respective district itself. Vadodara itself has seen a major surge in the number of patients.The trend had started emerging since last month itself and a video conference of collectors of the districts from where patients were reaching Vadodara was conducted. But the trend has continued, putting pressure on hospitals in the city that are already packed.Officer on special duty for Covid-19 Vinod Rao said that the patients from districts bordering Vadodara or located close by, used to come late after a referral from a local hospital. These patients usually occupied ICU beds in the city hospitals.In an attempt to ensure that patients get treatment locally, all Covid hospitals, oxygen beds and ICU beds in the region had been mapped in nine districts. The information will be linked with the VMC portal to get real-time online information regarding the availability of beds.Rao said that this information will be integrated with the108 ambulances and patients will be taken by these ambulances to nearby hospitals with available beds. For instance, patients from Bharuch can be taken to Ankleshwar instead of Vadodara or patients from Anklav and Bhadran can be taken to Karamsad or Anand instead of Vadodara. Besides reducing the pressure on Vadodara, the administration is also expected to ensure early treatment of patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/patients-from-other-dists-flood-vadodara/articleshow/81975777.cms||---

The GMC becomes the second municipal body in UP after Lucknow to be listed on the stock exchange. A government spokesperson said that the corporation was rated AA by two agencies and the coupon rate of the bond was fixed at 8.1%. “The bonds have a maturity of 10 years with staggered redemption. The municipal corporation has also received an incentive of Rs 19.5 crore from the Centre for raising funds through municipal bonds,” he said. The bonds, with a base issue of Rs 100 crore and a green issue option of Rs 50 crore, have generated funds for a tertiary sewage treatment plant to be set up in Ghaziabad’s Indirapuram for use in the Sahibabad Industrial Area. The total cost of the project is Rs 240 crore. An official said that the detailed project report has been readied and the treated waste water will be purchased by local industrialists which would reduce their dependence on groundwater. The project is slated to be completed within 27 to 30 months. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath said: “It is a matter of pride for UP that GMC has raised Rs 150 crore through its Green Bond which got listed on BSE. It is the trust of the investors which UP has earned during the last four years of governance which will augment our effort to improve infrastructure in urban areas. It also shows the improvement in the industrial climate of the state and the trust which investors have reposed in the state machinery.” UP urban development minister Ashutosh Tandon highlighted the broader aspects of the work being done by the government of UP and said that other urban local bodies would soon follow the example set up Lucknow and Ghaziabad to similarly raise funds for various infrastructural development projects. When it was launched in November 2020, the Rs 200 crore Lucknow Municipal Corporation bond was oversubscribed by 4.5 times and closed at 8.5% coupon rate for 10 years. The funds raised will be used for various infrastructure schemes like water supply and housing which are being implemented under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) Scheme. Ashish Kumar Chauhan, MD & CEO of BSE said: “The order book was filled more than four times in a matter of few minutes, which establishes Ghaziabad Nagar Nigam as a credible entity in the Indian bond market. The green bond market has immense potential and is an attractive opportunity for Indian municipalities to leverage funds for meeting clean and climate-resilient urban infrastructure targets for the nation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ghaziabad-municipal-corps-bond-listed-on-bse-other-cities-to-follow/articleshow/81978385.cms||---
---||Delhi||Man misbehaves with crew, strips on Bengaluru-Delhi flight||NEW DELHI: Passengers on an Air Asia flight from Bengaluru to Delhi were in for a shock when a flyer onboard stripped naked and created ruckus mid-air, causing the authorities to hand him over to police once i5-722 landed at the Indira Gandhi International Airport. The authorities say the man was inebriated and could be placed on the no-fly list. The flyer reportedly first misbehaved with a cabin crew member during the journey on Tuesday. On being asked to behave, he began stripping and started creating a scene, causing the cabin crew to alert the pilot. “The pilot relayed the same to the air traffic control at the Delhi airport and both CISF and Delhi Police were informed. The passenger was asked to dress up again, which he did, but tried to strip for a second time,” said an official. An AirAsia India spokesperson said, “An inebriated guest onboard i5-722, from Bengaluru to New Delhi on April 6, behaved in an inappropriate manner, including with a cabin crew on duty. The guest was advised repeatedly and paid heed only after multiple requests by crew members.” Delhi Police has registered a case, while the passenger’s report is being looked into by both the civil aviation ministry and Airports Authority of India. Air Asia said the matter was reported on landing at the Delhi airport to police and necessary action has been initiated by AirAsia India based on regulations governing the safety and well-being of aircraft and passengers under the disruptive passenger handling policy. “As an airline that has consistently emphasised and worked towards the security and well-being of our guests and crew, we have a zero-tolerance approach to disruptive behaviour on our flights and strongly condemn incidents of such nature,” the airline added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-misbehaves-with-crew-strips-on-flight/articleshow/81977144.cms||---

---||Lucknow||HC seeks govt response on ’15 as base year for rotational quota||LUCKNOW: The Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court on Thursday sought response of the state government and State Election Commission (SEC) on a plea challenging the constitutionality of the recent amendment in Panchayati Raj Rules providing suitable changes in the rules to make 2015 as the base year for providing rotational quota in the three-tier panchayat elections in Uttar Pradesh which already commenced on march 26. The court also issued notice to the advocate general to address it on the question of the challenge to the constitutionality of the said amendment. It fixed the matter after three weeks for the next hearing. A bench of Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and Justice Manish Mathur passed the order on the writ petition filed by one Dilip Kumar through his lawyer Amit Singh Bhadoria. The petitioner also challenged the March 26, 2021, notification of the SEC whereby it announced the three-tier elections. The petitioner had pleaded that the rotation system started in 1995 and once it began it could not be set at naught by providing a new base year in 2015. “The system of reservation being followed from 1995 cannot be set at naught to defeat legitimate expectation of enforced equality of villages with lower population of protected groups that have not benefitted from reservation thus far”, pleaded Bhadauria in the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hc-seeks-govt-response-on-15-as-base-year-for-rotational-quota/articleshow/81978396.cms||Ravi Singh Sisodiya
---||Noida||Noida left with 4,745 Covishield doses, DM insists ‘no shortage’||GHAZIABAD/NOIDA: Private hospitals in Noida and Ghaziabad, faced with an acute shortage of Covid vaccines, are either turning away recipients or allowing only those who have registered themselves. With about 6,200 shots of Covishield and 820 of Covaxin administered on Thursday, Noida is left with just 4,745 Covishield doses.  This, sources said, may not cover the entire drive on Friday and more private facilities are expected to refuse walk-in vaccinations. In Ghaziabad, health department officials claimed to have 15,000 doses of both the vaccines, but most of them were for government hospitals. Officials in private hospitals said they were being given just half of the doses they used to get earlier. Many of them said if the supplies didn’t improve, they would allow walk-in vaccinations only from Monday. The authorities in Noida, however, said there was enough stock to last 2 days and hoped fresh supplies would arrive by then. “There is no shortage and we will hopefully receive fresh stocks soon. Till then, we will schedule vaccination appointments based on availability,” said Suhas LY, the Noida district magistrate. In Ghaziabad, where officials claimed to have 15,000 doses in stock, several private hospitals put up signboards informing recipients they had stopped the vaccination drive for now. According to sources, the available doses of vaccine are mostly being supplied to government centres. As a result, there is a rush of people to get themselves inoculated at government hospitals. Both Noida and Ghaziabad had last month been accused of not vaccinating enough people. The drive picked up pace after the government allowed those aged over 45 years to get themselves vaccinated. Initially, 36 private hospitals and 46 government ones were administering the vaccine in Ghaziabad. But over the past few days, several private hospitals have pulled out over depleting stocks. For instance, Ganesh and LYF hospitals in the district have stopped the vaccination drive for now. St Joseph’s Hospital had last allowed recipients on Sunday. Officials at LYF Hospital said they had been told they would get the next stock by Friday or Saturday. Choudhury Hospital, which has vaccine stock to last this week, is hoping to get fresh supplies next week. On Thursday, only 13 private hospitals in Ghaziabad could participate in the vaccination drive, five down from 18 a day earlier. Representatives of several private facilities in the district could be seen making rounds of the chief medical officer’s office, but coming back empty-handed. NK Gupta, the Ghaziabad CMO, said government vaccine centres should not face any problem because the health department still had 15,000 doses left. He said he had demanded fresh supplies from the government and most of it would be directed to the private centres. Among residents who were turned away from private vaccine centres was Sameer Jindal, who lives in Indirapuram. “My wife and I have been trying to get inoculated for the past three days. But these private hospitals are saying they don’t have enough stock,” he added. Many residents complained they could not find any slot till May. According to the health department’s figures, a total of 8,171 people took vaccine shots in Ghaziabad on Thursday, of which, only 1,117 were inoculated in private hospitals. In Noida, 7,025 people were vaccinated on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-left-with-4745-covishield-doses-dm-insists-no-shortage/articleshow/81978400.cms||Snehil Sinha

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Back-to-back campaigns take a toll on these candidates||Thiruvananthapuram: As the candidates in the district take a break after a monthlong campaign, some among them deserve it more considering they had been through two gruelling series of campaigns within a span of three months. A day after the elections, R K Ansajtha Russal deals with a sore throat and a hoarse voice. She had literally gone on a high-pitched campaign. In November 2020, she had visited colonies, shops and houses in five panchayats under Vellarada division as candidate for district panchayat election. She had directly attended 90% gatherings of employment guarantee scheme workers and thereby ensuring that she built a connect with each of the households. When her candidature was announced, she had to cover nine panchayats and she planned it smartly focusing more on four panchayats which had to be covered from the scratch. “I took my local body campaign as the first phase. I had made personal connect with my voters in November and this assembly polls I built on that work and focused extensively on four panchayats in Parasala constituency,” said Russal, who represents Vellarada division in the district panchayat. Even after two back-to-back campaigns spanning nearly 60 days braving the heat and Covid threat, Russal still found herself busy. On Wednesday, she was visiting hospitals where some of her campaign workers who got injured in an interparty clash on the final day of campaign were admitted. “There is no doubt that it is physically taxing to be on our feet for such a prolonged time span. I have been doing this for the past 25 years and had been a district panchayat member since 1995. Experience helps,” she says. O S Ambika, who is the first woman candidate to represent CPM in elections to Attingal legislative assembly, was picked for the new role while serving as the president of Chirayinkeezhu block panchayat for the second term. During her campaign, she had sustained injuries to her arm and leg as a concrete slab on which she was standing broke and she fell into a drain. She is yet to follow up on the treatment due to the busy nature of the campaign. “I covered around 12 colonies per panchayat for assembly elections. Every day I used to return home with severe pain in my feet but we draw energy from our supporters to meet as many voters as possible,” says Ambika. G S Asha Nath, who won from Pappanamcode ward in corporation elections, was in for an uphill task as BJP candidate in Chirayinkeezhu. She also had to switch between Nemom and Chirayinkeezhu as the party had entrusted her with campaign duties in Nemom as well. “The open jeep campaigns and processions were really tiring. I was an athlete during my school days and it really helped deal with exhaustion from heat,” says Nath who also found time to play cricket with youngsters during her campaign. V V Rajesh also had to go through dual campaign sessions. He won from Poojapura in corporation polls and then went on for a tight fight in assembly polls at Vattiyoorkavu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/back-to-back-campaigns-take-a-toll-on-these-candidates/articleshow/81975793.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Three months ago, she moved into a rented house in Sun City.

On Wednesday, the couple moved to a new house in Hydershakote. In the night, Basappa got into an argument with Padmamma. He slammed her head to the wall and the floor, killing her on the spot,” Narsingi SI Anvesh Reddy said. At 5am, Basappa locked the house and tried to sneak out of the area.

Dismissing a PIL — ‘In Re-Postponement of UP Panchayat Election 2021’ — a division bench comprising Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Saurabh Shyam Shamshery observed, “The state government, while notifying elections in Panchayat Raj Institutions has already declared a protocol to be adhered during the election campaign of the elections. This court has also issued certain directions in Public Interest Litigation (PIL) relating to corona pandemic for the state government to follow during the entire process of elections. All necessary care as such shall be taken by the state government to prevent spread of infection during the course of Panchayat Raj elections. Hence, the PIL is dismissed.” This petition, said to be in public interest, was preferred to have a direction for the state of Uttar Pradesh to postpone the Uttar Pradesh Panchayat Election scheduled from April 15, 2021. As per the petitioner, looking to the massive surge in coronavirus infection in different parts of the state, it would be against public interest to hold the panchayat elections in rural areas. According to the petitioner, the elections would be causing enormous injury to the health of public at large and that would be in contravention to Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which provides protection of life and personal liberty. After hearing rival submissions, the court dismissed the PIL, saying, “We do not find any merit in the argument advanced.” The court passed this order on April 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-turns-down-pil-seeking-ban-on-panchayat-poll-due-to-covid-surge/articleshow/81976577.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

He said, “Farmers operate combine harvesters round-the-clock and it has been observed that during night raw crop is harvested, which is full of moisture. Later, farmers face problems during procurement. Besides, pollution-causing stubble burning has also been banned.” The Mohali administration has also imposed an environmental compensation fine of Rs 50,000 on a farmer found operating a combine harvester without super straw management system (Super SMS). The combine harvester machine of the farmer was also impounded. The DC said, “Amid the coronavirus pandemic, it has become all the more important to check stubble burning as polluted air may put people with co-morbidities at higher risk. Farmers and combine operators must resort to stubble management practices by adopting new hi-tech technologies.” Super SMS attached with the combine chops the straw into minute pieces, making it easier for other machines to operate in the fields. It has the potential to do away with the stubble burning trend as other machines can directly sow seedlings while ploughing the existing residue in the field. Farmers not happy with decisionMany small-time farmers are not happy with the decision of banning the use of combine harvesters during night. They said they get the machine only after owners have harvested their produce. Jasbir Singh, Kultar Singh, Mohinder Singh and Prem Singh, farmers from Mullanpur, Jayanti Majri, Parch and other villages, have small land holdings. They said they could not afford to buy combine harvesters with super seeders. So, they take machines on rent and these are available only during night. “Banning of harvesters at night will waste our time, leading to overripening of the crop,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-prohibits-use-of-combine-harvesters-between-7pm-and-10am/articleshow/81975773.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

The vaccine - developed with Oxford University and considered a frontrunner in the global vaccine race - has been plagued by safety concerns and supply problems since Phase III trial results were published in December, with Indonesia the latest country forced to seek doses from other vaccine developers. The Philippines suspended the use of AstraZeneca shots for people below 60 after Europe's regulator said on Wednesday it found rare cases of blood clots among some adult recipients although the vaccine’s advantages still outweighed its risks. Australia recommended people under 50 should get Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine in preference to AstraZeneca's, a policy shift that it warned would hold up its inoculation campaign. The African Union is exploring options with Johnson & Johnson having dropped plans to buy AstraZeneca's vaccine from India's Serum Institute, the head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention told reporters. AstraZeneca's shot is sold at cost, for a few dollars a dose. It is by far the cheapest and most high-volume launched so far, and has none of the extreme refrigeration requirements of some other COVID-19 vaccines, making it likely to be the mainstay of many vaccination programmes in the developing world. But more than a dozen countries have at one time suspended or partially suspended use of the shot, first on concerns about efficacy in older people, and now on worries about rare side effects in younger people. That, coupled with production setbacks, will delay the rollout of vaccines across the globe as governments scramble to find alternatives to tame the pandemic which has killed more than 3 million. 'EXTREMELY RARE' Italy joined France, the Netherlands, Germany and others in recommending a minimum age for recipients of AstraZeneca's shot on Wednesday and Britain said people under 30 should get an alternative. South Korea also suspended use of the vaccine in people under 60 this week, while approving Johnson & Johnson's shot. AstraZeneca has said it is working with the British and European regulators to list possible brain blood clots as "an extremely rare potential side-effect". South Africa also paused AstraZeneca vaccinations last month because of a small trial showing the shot offered minimal protection against mild to moderate illness caused by the dominant local coronavirus variant. AstraZeneca is grappling with production issues that have led to shortfalls of its shot in several countries. Indonesian Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin said on Thursday the country was in talks with China on getting as many as 100 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to plug a gap in deliveries after delays in the arrivals of AstraZeneca shots. India has put a temporary hold on all major exports of AstraZeneca's shot made by the Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s biggest vaccine-maker, as domestic infections rise. That has affected supplies to the GAVI/WHO-backed global COVAX vaccine-sharing facility through which 64 poorer countries are supposed to get doses from the SII, the programme’s procurement and distributing partner UNICEF told Reuters last month. Britain is slowing its vaccine rollout due to a shipment delay from India and is at loggerheads with the EU over exports. Australia has also blamed delays in its immunisation campaign on supply issues in Europe. AstraZeneca has cited reduced yields at a European factory behind the supply shortfall to the European Union.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/more-countries-put-age-curbs-on-astra-shot-amid-clot-fears/articleshow/81979172.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Mamata Banerjee has forgotten Ma, Mati, Manush: Yogi Adityanath in Bengal||LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday again attacked Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee and accused her of unleashing party goons to orchestrate violence in West Bengal during the anti-CAA protest to garner votes from a particular community. Addressing rallies in Champdani, Chanditala assembly seats of Hooghly and Sankrail seat in Howrah, Yogi said the TMC government deliberately turned a blind eye towards rioters in pursuance of its policy of appeasement of a particular community. “Mamata Didi ko in dangaiyon mein TMC ka vote bank nazar aata hai (Mamata sees vote bank in the rioters),” he said.He pointed out that his government cracked down on the rioters and recovered from them the cost of damages done to the government properties. Yogi also flayed the TMC boss for not abiding by the slogan ‘Ma, Mati, Manush’ (Mother, Motherland and People) which she had given before storming to power in Bengal 10 years ago. “She speaks of Ma but restricts the puja of Durga Ma and supports the slaughter of Gau Mata (cow),” he said sarcastically. Yogi said that if Mamata thinks that people performing Durga Puja are communal then so be it. “We will not compromise with ‘aastha’ (faith) of people,” he said.The CM said that Mamata may be speaking of ‘Mati’ but she does not allow farmers to get the benefit of PM Kisan Samman Scheme that ensures Rs 6,000 per annum to small and marginal farmers. “She has rather turned the ‘mati’ of Bengal into a synonym of corruption,” he said, highlighting the Saradha chit fund scam and the alleged involvement of the family of Mamata’s nephew Abhishev Banerjee in a mining scam. “Yahan ka manush thaga hua mehsoos karta hai (people of Bengal feel cheated),” Yogi said, asking Mamata where was the ‘Poriborton’ (change) she had promised to the people of Bengal. BJP’s star campaigner said Bengal was on the verge of another ‘Parivartan’ as BJP is getting massive public support in the assembly elections.“Why is there dejection and disappointment in this land of scientists and philosophers who once gave new directions to the progress of the country,” Yogi asked, pointing out that the Bengali youth was forced to migrate from the state which has given several famous freedom fighters to the country. The UP CM also hit out at the TMC for opposing the development ideas and vision of PM Narendra Modi by obstructing welfare schemes of the Centre. He said BJP will fulfil the dream of ‘Sonar Bangla’ once it comes to power in Bengal after May 2. “There would be a complete end to hooliganism and corruption. There would be rule of law. Every person would benefit from government schemes,” he said, adding that the BJP government would set up ‘anti-Romeo’ squads like UP for the safety of women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mamata-has-forgotten-ma-mati-manush-yogi-in-bengal/articleshow/81978427.cms||Pankaj Shah

Meanwhile, district collector Avinash Lavania, on Thursday wrote to hospitals asking for judicious use of Ramdesivir on Covid-19 patients, following a letter of controller, food & drug administration, Dr Sanjay Goyal, to CMHOs across the state, saying that Ramdesivir is for “restricted emergency use” and it should be used according to guidelines of the Union health ministry. In a clear move to curb the use of Remdesivir, Dr Goyal wrote, “Record should be maintained as to which emergency situation necessitated the use of the drug on a patient and the expert should write down the reason for giving this injection to a patient in his prescription.” He further said if a doctor prescribes it except in an emergency situation and the pharmacist dispenses the vial, they will be “responsible” for it. Following this, the district collector in a letter written to director, AIIMS, dean, Gandhi medical college and all other government and private medical colleges and hospitals, on Thursday, asked them to strictly follow the health ministry guidelines on the use of Remdesivir. He further asked for maintaining record on use of Remdesivir and present the same to inspecting or investigating officials, when demanded. President of Bhopal Chemist Association, Lalit Jain, when asked about the supply situation of Remdesivir, said, “If the demand shoots up all of a sudden, an imbalance in demand and supply is only natural. Besides, the drug is supplied mainly from Mumbai and Pune, which are worst affected by coronavirus, so its consumption there is very high. Then, it comes to Indore, which again is the worst affected district in MP. So, whatever is left, comes to Bhopal and other areas of MP. That’s why the drug is in short supply.” But, he denied the charge of black-marketing of drug and said “If somebody knows, which medical shop is black-marketing the drug, give his name in your newspaper and let there be action against him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/remdesivir-missing-from-markets-as-ve-cases-surge/articleshow/81975838.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

---||Kochi||Water scarcity triggers acute diarrhoea disease in Ernakulam||KOCHI: Scorching summer heat and water scarcity pose health risks for residents in the district. Acute diarrhoea disease (ADD) outbreaks are being reported from various parts of Ernakulam, including West Kochi and Chellanam which face acute water shortage every summer. Thrikkakara and Ayyampuzha also witnessed ADD outbreaks early this year. The outbreak in West Kochi was reported in three events last month. Division numbers 1 and 4 are still active in ADD. As many as 6,887 acute diarrhoea cases have been reported in the district so far this year. Source of infection of most of the incidents are related to sucking drinking water using motor directly from the pipe of Kerala Water Authority (KWA), using water supplied through tanker trucks or using piped water without boiling. People in West Kochi and Chellanam are solely dependent on KWA for water. The authority had shut down the supply two times last month as part of their routine maintenance works. When the water supply was disrupted, many residents sucked water using advanced motors, directly from the KWA pipelines. These old pipelines are near drainage system. When water is sucked directly from the pipes, the joints of pipes get widened due to pressure and the contaminated water enter the lines. When residents use this water without boiling, they get infected with diarrhoea. More than 80 cases were reported from West Kochi in March from three incidents. Tanker truck is also one of the sources as the storage tank might not be clean,” said a health officer. It has been found that people using welcome drinks at functions, where boiled water is not used, also contract diarrhoea. Health authorities warn that failure in following hygiene would also result in diarrhoea. “Elderly people would say they grew up drinking water directly from the well and it was a healthy habit. But now things have changed. The groundwater is contaminated and one should drink water only after boiling it,” says a health officer. Corporation health standing committee chairman T K Ashraf said people ignore early advisories by the KWA about shutting down of supply for maintenance works. In Ayyampuzha, children drank piped water and they contracted diarrhoea. Health authorities urge people to wash their hands after using the toilet. Avoid eating uncooked vegetable salad, juice, chutney, buttermilk, curd and mint juice from hotels and eateries, said the advisory. Comorbid people, children and elderly should be taken care of if they develop diarrhoea. An apartment complex at Thrikkakara also reported ADD outbreak in January this year after their well got contaminated with flood water. “Due to Covid pandemic no outsiders were allowed inside apartment complexes in the city. As a result overhead tanks remained uncleaned. We found carcass of a bat in their overhead tank,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/water-scarcity-triggers-add-in-ekm/articleshow/81975847.cms||---

Director-general, prisons, Anand Kumar on Thursday reviewed security arrangements at Banda district jail where Mukhtar is lodged. Later, talking to TOI, he said that the department is using artificial intelligence (AI) based technology for the surveillance of prisons in the state. He also took a glimpse of security provisions using a video wall established at the prison headquarters. The video wall has 24 screens from where all the 72 jails are monitored online. It runs on exclusive leased lines of 100 mbps each. UP was the first state in the country to come up with such state-of-art facilities in 2019, said the DG. Another jail official privy to the probe said that night vision drone cameras will be used in Banda jail to keep a vigil not just on the jail premises, but also wide area around the jail. A three-member police team has been trained by experts in managing AI-based drone cameras which would be used from Friday to keep a vigil on the jail premises. The official also said that as many as 50 jail personnel have been decked up with body worn cameras to check minute-to-minute details of their interaction with jail inmates. No personnel from eastern up has been included in the team managing the jail premises mainly because the mafia don, too, belongs to the same area. Another senior jail official in Banda said that wheel-chair of the don was taken away as doctors said that it was not required. The don is walking normally without the wheel-chair.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ai-based-drones-to-keep-an-eye-on-banda-dist-jail/articleshow/81978440.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||HC rejects woman’s plea to quash suicide abetment case||Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court (HC) has held that merely because details of alleged quarrels between a couple are not given in an FIR, an inference cannot be drawn that such quarrels had no connection with the suicide. Especially, when the allegations about the quarrels are supported by two suicide notes left behind by the deceased, the court said.A high court division bench of justices Ravindra Ghuge and B U Debadwar rejected an application by a 32-year-old woman from Kannad tehsil in Aurangabad for quashing of an FIR lodged by her brother-in-law accusing the woman of driving her husband (aged 39 years) to end his life a little over four months after their marriage by picking up frequent quarrels with him.The deceased, a farmer from Kannad tehsil, had hung himself from a tree in his farm on February 7, 2019. The police, while removing the body, found a suicide note from his pocket. The note mentioned that the deceased was fed up with frequent quarrels with his wife with whom he had a second marriage. The note formed the basis for his younger brother to lodge a suicide abetment case against the woman.Post-funeral and last rites, the Kannad police came across another identical suicide note which was found tucked in the speedometer of the motorcycle belonging to the deceased and mentioning the same cause behind his decision to take the extreme step. On a few occasions prior to his suicide, the deceased had also confided in his younger brother about the frequent quarrels his wife would pick up and how he was frustrated by his second marriage.The woman’s lawyer had argued in the plea for quashing of the FIR that the same did not mention any specific details of the alleged quarrels between the couple and, that, the woman had no intention to drive her husband to suicide.The bench, however, observed that the deceased was mentally and physically fit person and had committed suicide only within four months and six days after the marriage with the applicant.“It is alleged in the FIR and two suicide notes, left behind by deceased…., that the applicant used to pick-up quarrels with him frequently. Therefore, he was fed-up and committed suicide. In view of these material allegations made in the FIR and two suicide notes left behind by deceased……, at this juncture, inference cannot be drawn that the applicant did not instigate her husband…… to commit suicide or there was no intention behind the quarrels, which she used to pick-up with her husband frequently. Only after trial, this material aspect can be decided. Therefore, it is not proper to quash the FIR getting influenced with the submission that the applicant had no intention to drive her husband….. to commit suicide,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-rejects-womans-plea-to-quash-suicide-abetment-case/articleshow/81974174.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The CBI produced both the accused before its special court on Thursday and obtained their two days’ police remand for further interrogation.The accused have been identified as Anil Mor, a resident of Jind, and Dilbagh Singh of Kaithal.In his complaint to the CBI, Mohit Sharma, director of MS Fantasy Gaming Technology Pvt Ltd, Ambala, said he received a call from the accused, who allegedly demanded a bribe of Rs 50 lakh to settle a complaint filed against him regarding a property dispute at the office of Zirakpur DSP Amroj Singh. The complainant said, “Anil Mor claimed that he was close to the DSP. I had already paid a bribe of Rs 12.5 lakh to the accused and Rs 10 lakh was the second instalment.” Mohit gave a complaint to the CBI and after verifying it, the agency registered an FIR. The accused asked Mohit to come with Rs 10 lakh at Narwana, Haryana, on Wednesday. The CBI sleuths laid a trap and as soon as one of the accused accepted the bribe and handed it over to the other, they nabbed them and recovered the money. The DSP was inquiring the complaint against Mohit and the police had frozen his accounts. During the hearing in the CBI court, the public prosecutor said they needed the police remand of both the accused to investigate the role of DSP Amroj Singh and others. CBI sleuths also conducted searches at three residences of both accused in Jind, Kaithal and Zirakpur and seized some documents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cbi-arrests-two-for-taking-bribe-to-settle-property-case/articleshow/81975834.cms||---

Health officials and doctors said that people are still hesitant to take the vaccine and efforts are on to increase awareness.As per the data from Open Government Data Portal of Tamil Nadu, around 5,50,000 beneficiaries have received the first dose in the ten southern districts. However, except for Madurai and Virudhunagar, none of the other southern districts have crossed one lakh vaccinations. Nearly 40% of the total vaccinations in south TN are from these two districts.Health officials said that there was no significant increase in vaccinations. “The vaccination is progressing steadily but it is not up to the mark. We are trying to create more awareness at ground level. But, some people are still hesitant,” said a district health official from Kanyakumari.In Madurai district, out of the total beneficiaries to be vaccinated, nearly 60% are from the general public. “Many among the elderly, especially those who are already taking medications for other diseases, are worried about adverse reactions. But, not taking the vaccine is actually riskier since the vaccine greatly lessens the severity of Covid-19 infection in elderly and those with comorbidities,” said a senior physician from Madurai. On the other hand, health officials said that since vaccination is not mandatory, many of those aged above 45 years who do not have comorbid conditions are not keen to take the vaccine. Even many of the healthcare workers, especially from private sector, are yet to take the jab due to poor awareness. Health officials said that due to elections, there could have been a slow response for the drive . They expect more people to come forward in the coming week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/vaccination-still-sluggish-in-southern-districts/articleshow/81978431.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

There was a jump of 176 cases and seven deaths from the previous day, which itself were records. The cases were reported from 19,176 tests, slightly less than Wednesday’s number (19,191).The figures jumped due to high number of cases from Nagpur rural which probably reported its highest ever tally of 2,628 cases and 28 deaths. The city saw a slight dip in cases with Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) reporting 2,881 positive cases and 40 Covid deaths.Rural areas had never reported more cases than city before. Health officials are shocked to see the spread of infection in rural areas. High number of cases from rural areas would stress resources there as well and increase burden on city’s health infrastructure, which has almost collapsed, officials said.The district also reported 3,277 recoveries which included 1,112 from rural and 2,165 from city. The district now has 45,097 active cases.As per the civil surgeon press note, the district has 6,082 Covid patients hospitalized or in Covid care centres. Of these, 5,146 are in over 100 hospitals in the city and outskirts including 505 in 12 tehsils in the district.The second consecutive tally of over 5,000 cases took this month’s numbers to 33,697, which is more than any month except September.The district also inched closer to 500 fatalities within nine days of April on Friday as number of critical patients is high in this second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/high-rural-cases-push-daily-district-tally-to-new-high/articleshow/81975836.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Deputy commissioner (excise) T Sudhakar passed a notification lifting the levy on Wednesday. The move is expected to boost the hospitality, service, tourism and allied sectors that were hit adversely due to the lockdown. The administration imposed a 25% levy on special excise duty on liquor products sold in the territory from June last year to mobilize funds to battle Covid-19. "From today, April 8, 2021, the price regime that was in existence before the imposition of special excise duty will be restored," lieutenant governor (additional charge) Tamilisai Soundararajan said on Thursday. Spokesmen of various associations representing the hotels, bars and restaurants, wholesale liquor merchants and allied sectors welcomed the government’s decision though remarking that it was taken belatedly. “Our members have proposed to offer a 5% discount to customers who have taken the Covid-19 vaccine to encourage people to come forward and take the vaccin,” said Hotel Association of Pondicherry treasurer Anand Gandhi Raj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/puducherry/liquor-to-be-cheaper-in-pondy-again/articleshow/81975843.cms||Bosco Dominique
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh man gets death for killing pregnant wife||VIJAYAWADA: The Mahila Sessions Court at Vijayawada on Thursday awarded death sentence to a man who had killed his pregnant wife about two years ago by setting her on fire. The court had earlier convicted Battula Nambiar (35) for murder, domestic violence and dowry harassment. According to the prosecution, Nambiar, a jobless college lecturer, suspected his 30-yeatr-old wife Sailaja’s fidelity and often argued with her. On June 15, 2019, Nambiar poured petrol on Sailaja while she was asleep at their residence at Fakirgudem in Vijayawada and set her afire. There was no one at home at the time. Sailaja, who was pregnant, woke up screaming for help. Neighbours rushed into the house but by then Sailaja had received third-degree burns. She was taken to Vijayawada government hospital where she died a few hours later. Arguing for the prosecution, advocate Garimella Daiva Prasad told the court that all the material evidence and statements of witnesses proved that the accused committed the grievous crime. He also argued that the case fit the definition of rarest of the rare case. He added that the convict had carefully planned to kill his wife. Judge G Pratibha Devi too observed that the brutality of the murder fit the Supreme Court’s definition of rarest of the rare and awarded the death penalty. Police officials said Nambiar, a native of Jonnapadu in Krishna district, initially worked as a lecturer in a private junior college at Gudiwada town. He married Sailaja, who was a teacher in a private school at Krishna Lanka in Vijayawada, in December 2018. A few months after the marriage, Nambiar quit his job and stayed with his wife in a rented house. He used to depend on her for money. But soon he suspected her of having an affair. He even argued with his in-laws over the issue multiple times. Sailaja’s two sisters and brother also stayed with her. Her parents stayed at Lingayapalem under Koduru mandal. The prosecution said on the fateful day, Sailaja’s siblings were visiting their parents. Nambiar began arguing with Sailaja and assaulted her before setting her on fire early in the morning. The police registered a case following a complaint from her father, Mohan Rao, and arrested Nambiar. After hearing the arguments on both sides and examining more than 18 witnesses, the court convicted him under all charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-man-gets-death-for-killing-pregnant-wife/articleshow/81978445.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Government hospitals have also run out of antiviral injection, Remdesivir, for treating patients. According to health department sources, only those requiring a second dose of vaccine were given the jab on Thursday. A large number of people had started thronging the vaccine centres since the last week of March as the number of Covid-19 cases began to rise. After the government allowed people above 45 years of age to take the vaccine, the crowds increased even more. Chief medical officer of Agra district Dr RC Pandey said, “We have a limited stock available at select centres which is being administered to those requiring a second dose of the vaccine. The matter has been brought to the notice of the state government and demand for supply of vaccines is being placed. So far, Covid-19 vaccine has been administered to 1.48 lakh people in Agra district. Out of these, 1.15 lakh people have received the first dose and 33,000 the second dose.” On the shortage of remdesivir injection, Dr Sanjay Kala, principal of SN Medical College, said, “I have requested the state authorities to supply the medicine or allow us to directly purchase it from the market.” Meanwhile, 43 people were tested Covid-19 positive in Agra on Thursday, increasing the number of active cases in the district to 486. Four junior doctors of SN Medical College were among those who tested positive. They were on duty at the Covid care centre. Following a surge in Covid-19 cases, the district administration has declared that shops found violating social distancing norms will be shut down for 48 hours. Those found not wearing a face mask at public places will be penalized. The district administration is also planning to restrict public movement from 10 pm to 6 am. According to district magistrate Prabhu N Singh, in case 100 Covid-19 cases are reported within 24 hours or the number of active cases exceeds the 500 mark, public movement at night will be restricted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/200-of-227-covid-19-vax-centres-run-out-of-stocks-in-agra/articleshow/81974832.cms||Deepak Lavania

The state government has already advertised the post in March and the process for selection has already begun. The question of who will be the next UPPSC chairman is being hotly debated in the corridors of power in the state. Kumar is all set to retire by April 18 and the state government is scouting for a good candidate so that recruitments in state government remain fair and there is no taint on the state government which has been claiming fairness and transparency in job selections as its hallmark. The service term of the chairman is five years or 62 years of age and Prabhat Kumar is completing 62 years. Apart from serving and retired IAS officers, a good number of people from academics have also applied for the coveted post as head of the commission which recruits officers of state police and civil services also. Traditionally, any officer who enjoys the confidence of the dispensation in power and is close to the chief minister is appointed to the important post. Kumar had been known to be close to the chief minister and enjoyed his trust, apart from having an impeccable service record. Before taking up the assignment, Kumar was Agriculture Production Commissioner (APC) in the government. Rumour mills say a number of senior bureaucrats and academic are lobbying and even tapping links in the RSS for the coveted post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bureaucrats-lobbying-for-uppsc-chairmans-post/articleshow/81978459.cms||Subhash Mishra

Moradabad DIG Shalabh Mathur has, meanwhile, suspended the erring cops with immediate effect. Following the complaints lodged by commuters to the DIG, a police team led by inspector Rahul Singh from the DIG office raided the Najibabad-Kotdwar road and caught the three cops, including Jafrabad picket incharge, and three villagers red-handed. In a complaint lodged against the accused, inspector Singh stated, “DIG, Moradabad, had got a tip-off that a few people were extorting money from vehicle owners by erecting barricade on the road. During a raid, we found three persons standing close to the barricade raised on Najibabad-Kotdwar road and one of them was holding a torch and signalling drivers to stop their vehicles. As we found some vehicle owners giving money to them, we arrested accused Sachin Sharma and Mohammad Shakir of Jabtaganj mohalla in Najibabad and Harshvardhan from Salmabad village.” “According to the accused, they are poor and have been hired by chowki incharge Rameshwar for Rs 300 each to extort money from vehicle owners. A share of the extorted money goes to other officers, too. When our team entered the police chowki, we found sub-inspector Rameshwar Singh in the chair and seized Rs 17,000 from his possession and around Rs 9,000 from the three villagers hired by him. The SI's pistol was sealed," stated inspector Singh. A case has been registered against the accused under sections 384 (punishment for extortion) of the IPC, while the policemen were also booked under appropriate sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Bijnor superintendent of police Dharamveer Singh, meanwhile, said sub-inspector Rameshwar Singh, head constable Jafaruddin and constable Ashish Tomar posted at Jabtaganj police chowki were detained and suspended, while three other accused Sachin Sharma, Mohammad Shakir from Jabtaganj mohalla of Najibabad, Harshvardhan from Salmabad village were arrested.

---||Delhi||Reprieve likely for six thermal plants||New Delhi: Six thermal power plants, which are located within a 300-km radius of Delhi and are contributing to the capital’s pollution, are likely to receive relaxations for the next three years, states Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). In an analysis carried out by it, the NGO found the latest categorisation of thermal power plants — based on the Union environment ministry’s recent amendment to the 2015 notification for coal-based thermal power plants (TPPs) — will mean that over 72% of the total capacity of India’s thermal power plants will receive an extension in the deadline to comply with stringent emission norms. Norms to limit pollutants from TPPs were announced in 2015 and were expected to be adopted by 2017. The deadline for compliance was later extended till 2022. So far, a mere one-third of the plants have taken steps in order to switch to cleaner technology, claims CSE. “Instead of working to ensure implementation, the ministry has chosen to extend the deadline further, allowing a majority of the plants to pollute for another three to four years. However, extension is not the only matter to be worried about. What makes this a fatally flawed notification is that the deterrence provided in it for non-compliance actually gives the polluters a licence to pollute,” said Sunita Narain, director general at CSE. Power plants are falling into three categories — Category A, including TPPs in a 10-km radius of NCR or cities having a million-plus population as per the 2011 census; Category B that includes TPPs in a 10-km radius of critically polluted areas and non-attainment cities; and the rest of the TPPs are in Category C. TPPs in Category A have to meet the deadline by 2022, while those in Category B need to meet it by by 2023, and in Category C by 2024. CSE states flouting the deadlines is also easier because the penalty is less. “While installing the equipment for pollution control will cost between Rs 40-100 lakh/MW, the penalty that thermal power plants will have to pay to keep running without installing this equipment is roughly Rs 5-11 lakh/MW,” said the CSE analysis. “It is clear that thermal power sector is a major contributor to India’s pollution challenge – from air to water – and this notification nullifies all the work that was being done to improve performance of the sector,” says Nivit Kumar Yadav, programme director, Industrial Pollution Unit, CSE. For those polluting Delhi, the six TPPs likely to receive extensions largely fall in Punjab. Earlier, they had to comply with the 2019 deadline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/reprieve-likely-for-six-thermal-plants/articleshow/81977282.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||Patients taking longer to recover in second wave||Nagpur: A common experience of doctors in the present surge of Covid-19 cases in Vidarbha is that moderately and severely symptomatic patients are taking more time to recover as compared to the September wave. Though fewer patients are needing hospitalization this time, those who are in ICU or require oxygen supply are taking more days to recover. Weakness after discharge from hospital is also a major issue and persists for a longer time, said doctors.“During the September peak, 14 days of hospitalization was enough for most of the patients who recovered from Covid-19. At present, this span is more than 21 days,” said Dr Nilesh Bawankar, intensive care specialist. According to doctors, the co-morbidities of patients are holding sway during the Covid-19 treatment. “Patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic bronchitis are requiring more intensive care, oxygen and other support. Elderly patients are not recovering early. We have to wait after prescribing the medicines as per protocol,” said chest physician Dr P Vijayashree.As protocol of medicines and oxygen supply is now quite clear, doctors are following it and monitoring the health parameters of the patients admitted in hospitals. For those who are recovering under home isolation, the conditions are different. Officially too, the quarantine period has been increased from 14 days to 17 days considering the late recovery of patients.“I have been monitoring my SPO2 level and temperature daily during my quarantine period. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) authorities told me that I have to stay away from family members for 17 days now,” said Anushree Joshi, a teacher. Doctors also said that it has been taking more time for patients to overcome the fatigue and weakness after Covid-19. “Weakness used to persist till 2 weeks earlier. But more patients are requiring rest for up to 4 weeks since March 2020,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde. A comparative analysis between daily new cases and daily recoveries indicates that patients are taking more time to recover in the current surge. In September 2020, average difference between daily new cases and daily recoveries was 240. That means everyday 240 more new cases were reported than recoveries. In March 2021, the average difference was 1,398. In 8 days April, this number is 3,206. On April 8, nearly 5,000 more new cases were reported than number of recoveries. Due to this, the number of under-treatment patients is at a record high in this phase. In all, 81,281 patients are under treatment in Vidarbha. Recovery slowing down? - Average hospitalization period risen from 14 days to 21 days - Patients with co-morbidities taking even more time to recover - Not only elderly, but those young and fit in home isolation also taking more time- Post-Covid fatigue or weakness staying for more than 3 weeks now - Though severity of disease has reduced, recoveries are taking longer||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/patients-taking-longer-to-recover-in-second-wave/articleshow/81975844.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The hospitals are blaming it on third party administrators (TPAs) and insurance companies for delaying the clearance in times of crisis, and for arbitrary deductions in the bills by insurers.It takes at least 6-7 hours to grant approval under the cashless scheme at the time of discharge or death. This delays the whole process, holding up a bed for the incoming patient and leading to reluctance towards cashless facility, said hospitals’ sources. The TPA officials TOI contacted maintained that approvals were being granted in time. Insurance company sources are pointing towards hospitals. “Hospitals are overcharging and under the cashless scheme only justifiable expenses are cleared. Under cash mode, the onus is on the patient to submit a claim with the insurance company and get a reimbursement. This makes it convenient for the hospitals,” insurers said.Health insurance consultant Prasanna Dani said hospitals are insisting on advance cash payments. “There have been instances of insurance companies disallowing sizeable amounts from the bills submitted by hospitals at the time of cashless settlement,” he added. Another insurance consultant Rahul Khasnis said hospitals are insisting on cash payment for beds over and above the quota reserved for Covid patients. “As per norms, hospitals have set aside part of the beds exclusively for Covid patients. If any additional patient has to be taken in, cash payment is being insisted on,” he said.Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA) convener Dr Anup Marar said the delay by insurance companies was leading to loss of crucial work-hours for the already burdened hospital machinery. “During this period there are jittery patents waiting to get discharged and others waiting to get admitted,” he added.Marar said most insurance companies have fixed their own price of remdesivir drug to the “bare minimum level” based on government supply rates. Any additional claim is being disallowed, he stated.“Hospitals, on the other hand, are purchasing whatever brand is being made available by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In such cases relatives are unwilling to pay the difference amount. Relatives of patients availing cashless scheme are being asked to procure the drug on their own too,” he added.Marar shared a document in which Rs16,000 were deducted by a private insurer from a claim of Rs35,000 for remdesvir administered to a patient.Consumer activist Shahid Sharif said he had come across a number of cases of insistence of advance cash payment by hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hospitals-again-refusing-cashless-facility-for-covid-patients/articleshow/81975871.cms||Shishir Arya

The walkway, renovated by the Cochin Smart Mission Ltd at a cost of Rs 7.1 crore, was inaugurated on February 27. The walkway belongs to Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA). As there are no bins available, visitors either litter the waste on the walkway or simply throw it into the water. “The plastic bottles dumped in the water get accumulated around the roots of mangroves. A rag-picker collected around 100 plastic bottles from the roots of the mangroves on Wednesday. The quantity of waste being dumped would be more on Sundays when more people visit the area. A group of women from a nearby apartment complex collect it on Mondays. Lack of bins along the walkway forces people to litter the waste. The authorities concerned should take steps to prevent this,” says Ranjith G Thampi, an environmental activist. CSML said there are some more works to be completed on the walkway. “The contractor has been entrusted with the task of maintenance and waste collection in the walkway. We will install bins,” said a CSML source. Meanwhile, Kochi corporation also plans to install waste bins along the renovated walkway. “We have asked our workers to clean the walkway. We will install CCTV cameras besides posting three or four workers to nab the people who litter waste. Those who found dumping waste will be fined. We will also install signboards against waste dumping,” said health standing committee chairman T K Ashraf.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/renovated-walkway-is-now-in-a-state-of-neglect/articleshow/81975895.cms||---

---||Meerut||5 dead, four injured in explosion in firecracker godown in UP's Bijnor||Bijnor: Five persons were killed and at least four others injured in a powerful blast that tore through a firecracker godown in Uttar Pradesh’s Bijnor district on Thursday afternoon. Entire building was gutted in the subsequent fire which erupted after the blast in the district's Bakshiwala village. Five of the nine workers who were trapped inside the building at the time of the explosion were killed, instantly. Police with the help of locals managed to pull out four labourers alive, but seriously injured. They were rushed to district hospital. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath took cognisance of the incident and directed Bijnor’s district magistrate (DM) Ramakant Pandey and other senior officials to probe the matter. A magisterial inquiry has been set up. Officials said that the owner had a licence till 2025 to store the firecrackers. DM Pandey said, “A fire erupted because of the presence of some inflammable material. Apart from the five deaths, four others were injured. But their condition is not serious. The godown had license to operate until 2025.” The owner of the godown, Mohammad Yusuf, has been arrested. He was booked under IPC sections 336 (whoever does any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life or the personal safety of others) and 304 (whoever commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and under section 9 and 13 of Explosion Act. Chintu (22), Pradeep (18), Brijpal Singh (45), Kumar Shanu (29) and Vedpal (45) died in the blast. They were residents of Bijnor. Samarpal, who was lucky to have escaped with few burn injuries, said, “We were inside the godown when it all happened. Our five friends were charred to death. The fire engulfed the entire godown within minutes. We somehow escaped from death.” Bijnor’s superintendent of police Dharamveer Singh said, “A magisterial inquiry has been set up to get into details of the blast.” In February 2016, six persons were charred to death and another six were injured in an explosion in a firecracker shop at Chandpur town in Bijnor district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/5-dead-four-injured-in-explosion-in-firecracker-godown-in-ups-bijnor/articleshow/81974865.cms||Harveer Dabas

---||Hyderabad||Increase RT-PCR tests, fine all without masks: HC to Telangana govt||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Thursday directed the state government to increase RT-PCR tests to 70% of Covid-19 tests from the current low of 10%. It also asked the director-general of police (DGP) to strictly enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour and slap fines on violators of social distancing and mask norms. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy gave these directions while resuming the hearing in Covid-19 batch petitions. The bench went through the status reports furnished by state public health director Dr G Srinivas Rao and DGP M Mahendar Reddy and made several suggestions, sought answers to several queries and gave certain directions. Agreeing with a suggestion made by counsel L Ravi Chander, who wanted Section 17 of the Disaster Management Act be invoked, the bench asked advocate general BS Prasad to advise the state to constitute an advisory committee under this section with experts to chalk out strategies to tackle the onslaught of the virus. Referring to the contents of the DGP’s report that they had fined one lakh people for violating the norms last year, the bench told him that double that number could be achieved within just two days in GHMC area alone. “This is a thickly populated city and people have thrown caution to the wind, you have to enforce the law strictly,” the bench said. The bench also directed the state to create containment zones and micro-containment zones immediately to ensure movement of people into these affected areas was controlled. “Since your GOs that deal with the maximum ceiling of 200 guests for marriage functions etc., are valid only in containment zones, there is no point in having those GOs when you have abandoned the idea of creating containment zones altogether,” the bench said. “Also, you have to restrain the gathering of people at malls, liquor shops, theatres, marriages, funerals, etc. There are certain states that are hit badly by the second wave and you can impose a condition that all those who are entering Telangana while coming from such states, have to come with an RT-PCR test report. Several states such as Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, J&K have started doing this already. You had set up an RT-PCR lab at the Hyderabad airport to ensure that those who depart from here would get a quick lab report. Maybe you have to insist that they have to get a similar certificate when they are coming into Hyderabad,” the judges added. The AG assured the bench that he would convey the suggestions to the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/increase-rt-pcr-tests-fine-all-without-masks-hc-to-t-govt/articleshow/81978496.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Hyderabad||Firm begins activating frozen Karvy accounts||Hyderabad: Broking and advisory firm IIFL Securities Ltd said it has started activation of 11 lakh Karvy Stock Broking Ltd’s demat accounts that were frozen for over a year following the markets regulator Securities & Exchange Board of India (Sebi)’s directive. According to IIFL, the total assets under management for these 11 lakh Karvy demat accounts stands at Rs 3 lakh crore. The exercise was kicked off after IIFL recently won the official bid to acquire all the demat accounts held by Karvy with National Securities Depository Ltd and Central Depository Services Ltd. Sebi had decided to auction Karvy’s demat and trading accounts to compensate its clients for the losses they suffered after the demat scam came to light in November 2019. The bidding process began in early February and IIFL securities bagged the demat accounts. With this, all these Karvy account holders can now begin trading and investing activities with IIFL. The Karvy demat scam came to light in November 2019 and Sebi banned Karvy from taking new clients after it found the broking firm had illegally pledged funds and securities of clients. Commenting on the development, Sandeep Bhardwaj, CEO-retail, IIFL Securities, said with this the accounts of all Karvy demat account holders have been unfrozen and investors can start trading or investing with IIFL Securities.  He also said IIFL Securities has created a dedicated web platform and phone number for all Karvy demat account holders to facilitate restarting of these accounts and has, a goodwill gesture, waived off the first-year annual maintenance contract charges on these accounts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/firm-begins-activating-frozen-karvy-accounts/articleshow/81977292.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Twin-bin garbage collection stay: MC seeks legal advice||CHANDIGARH: The municipal corporation has asked for legal advice from senior standing counsel (SSC) of the Chandigarh administration on the decision of the Punjab and Haryana high court to stay collection of segregated garbage through twin-bin vehicles. “Since we had started the twin-bin vehicles in almost all the areas of the city by spending crores of rupees after the National Green Tribunal orders, we are looking into all the available options to fight the case in the court, therefore advice of the senior standing counsel has been sought. Based on the advice, the next course of action will be decided,” an official said. Sources in the municipal corporation said the authority can also file a review petition in the apex court. “But any decision will be taken after consultation with top legal and administrative officers of the Chandigarh administration,” they added. A division bench of the HC had stayed the operation and effect of the Solid Waste Management Bylaws, 2018, and the resolution dated December 13, 2019, passed by the MC to purchase garbage collection vehicles. One of the contentions before the bench was that the 2018 bylaws and the resolution were contrary to the letter and spirit of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, issued by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change, which contemplated the need to empower the garbage collectors and help ensure their employment. It was said that a clause in the guidelines issued by the ministry made it clear that it was the duty and responsibility of the local authorities to establish a system to recognise the organisation of waste pickers or informal waste collectors. And it was also their responsibility to promote and establish a system for integration of these authorised waste pickers and collectors to facilitate their participation in solid waste management, including door-to-door collection of waste. The bench was also told that the resolution was in conflict with the state policy, which endeavoured to create new employment opportunities and remove middlemen from all service sectors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/twin-bin-garbage-collection-stay-mc-seeks-legal-advice/articleshow/81975851.cms||Deepak Yadav

The man, Danish Ali, a resident of Meerut, uploaded a video on a social media platform saying that anyone who beheads the controversial priest will get Rs 51 lakh. The priest, Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati, recently made a controversial statement against the Prophet, prompting Delhi Police to book him for hurting religious sentiments. The statements were made at a press conference at Delhi Press Club. Danish is heard in the video purportedly saying, “I will sell my property, jewellery, everything. I have and will arrange Rs 51lakh.” Though Danish did not name Saraswati, he referred to him as the “priest of the Dasna temple in Ghaziabad.” Meerut’s superintendent of police (SP) Vineet Bhatnagar said, “We have arrested Danish Ali. We have also seized the mobile phone through which he had made the controversial announcement.” Reacting to the development, the priest said, “I have already said that I am ready for my assassination. But I stick to my stand. These people have always used terror to silence criticism because they don’t have anything substantial to debate.” The priest’s comments drew sharp reactions from various quarters. Jamiat Ulama-I-Hind’s general secretary Maulana Mehmood A. Madani has appealed to the Prime Minister to punish him for using “the filthiest and the most abusive epithets to insult the Prophet.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/man-arrested-for-announcing-reward-on-killing-of-controversial-dasna-priest/articleshow/81974917.cms||Sandeep Rai

However, there is a difference of opinion among doctors regarding the use of Remdesivir. Those who support use of Remdesivir believe it is a life saver for Covid-19 patient while others oppose the “rampant use” of the drug. TOI spoke to pharmacists, treating doctors and health experts on how useful the injection is, and the reason behind its shortage. Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral medication which is administered via injection into a vein. “It was originally developed to treat hepatitis C. Later, Remdesivir was effectively used for Ebola virus disease. As novel coronavirus started spreading, the medication was studied as a post-infection treatment for Covid-19,” said pharmacist Dr Vikram Ghodeswar. During the first wave of the pandemic, Remdesivir was approved or authorized for emergency use to treat Covid‑19 in around 50 countries. In India, the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) has approved only emergency use of this injection. Dr Sushant Meshram, head of Pulmonary and Sleep Medicine department of the Super Specialty hospital in Nagpur, told TOI that Covid-19 patients suffering from mild to severe disease have benefitted from Remdesivir in the first five days. “Injections can be given daily for one to five days. But if the patient is getting serious even after that, the treating doctor can continue the dose for a maximum of 10 days. However, this injection should be used with caution in patients with kidney disease,” he said. Remdesivir was given to 15 to 20% patients during the first wave which roughly ended in October 2020. Updated guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO) in November 2020 recommended against the use of Remdesivir for the treatment of Covid-19. So, it was expected that the use will reduce. Surprisingly, Remdesivir is now being used on 80% patients, especially at private hospitals. “It does not fit into the standard protocol but private hospitals are still using it exponentially,” said health minister Rajesh Tope while speaking with media on Monday about the reasons behind shortage of the drug. “Currently, doctors and hospitals are prescribing the injection even for those suffering with mild problem of breathlessness,” said Tope adding that it’s a violation of the protocol. After getting five to seven doses of Remdesivir, the patient’s bill to increases. Currently, the health department does not have a system to check whether every patient really needs this injection. The treating doctor is the only authority to decide. This has created a shortage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/is-remdesivir-a-life-saver-whats-causing-a-shortage/articleshow/81976015.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

With fresh surge in Covid-19 cases, the district administrations across the state have unanimously ordered closure of various establishments including gyms and swimming pools. The administration expressed apprehension that gyms could possibly become a source of spreading infection. However, those from the health industry have termed the move as counter productive. The association members apart from writing a letter to the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO), reached out to the revenue divisional commissioner’s office and made a written representation and demanded waiving off the electricity bills, rents, loans of the gyms. In addition to this they also demanded monetary compensation citing serious revenue losses the industry has suffered in the past one year. ABAM president Mohsin Ahmed said opening of gyms will not only be a source of relief for the industry,but will also help health conscious citizens in improving their immunity.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/gyms-should-be-allowed-to-operate-demands-bodybuilders-association/articleshow/81974907.cms||Mohammed Akhef

A video has gone viral in which a candidate and his supporters went to the extent of using a heavy earthmoving machine and spades for mixing ingredients to prepare laddoos to be distributed to voters. Police have booked 10 for violating model code of conduct. The incident occurred in Gauspur village under Singhawali Aheer police station of Baghpat. The village has 3,500 votes. According to Baghpat circle officer Anuj Mishra, “Investigations have revealed that Mohammad Jabbar, a candidate for the post of gram pradhan, along with his supporters had made huge quantity of sweets and distributed them among the villagers, which is a violation of the model code of conduct. A video has also come to our notice, in which he has deployed an earthmover and spades for making laddoos. Jabbar and his nine associates along with a dozen others have been booked under IPC 171 [E] (bribery) and 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant).” While the poll aspirant wasn’t available for comment, some villagers said that using earthmover to make laddoos was intended to make the video shot of the activity viral. Aslam Mohammad, a villager, said, “The quantity was not that much as can be seen in the video. But the entire idea and associated activity was quite hilarious and within no time, the video had gone viral.” This comes days after another pradhan aspirant was caught in a village in Amroha with 100 kg of rasgullas. He was distributing the packets among the voters. In the four-phase elections for 60,000 gram panchayats in the state, Baghpat will go to polls in the second phase on April 19.

The body arrived in his native village in Agra on Wednesday night after an autopsy was conducted in Delhi. Following the family’s protests, SSP Muniraj G ordered a joint inquiry by a two-member committee, comprising an ADM and Additional SP-rank officers, into the allegations and assured that strict action will be taken if anyone is found guilty in the matter. The SSP told TOI that the inquiry will be completed by the committee within a month. Earlier in the day, local residents and kin of the deceased blocked the Jaitpur road crossing here and refused to cremate Dharmendra’s mortal remains till “the cops responsible for his death in custody are suspended and an FIR registered against them”. The youth’s family alleged it was a case of custodial torture and death as Dharmender had been beaten up and threatened to be killed in an encounter. However, police claimed that he died due to rabies. “The cause of death will be made clear in the postmortem report, which will be received within a couple of days," said SP (east) K Venkat Ashok. According to police, the postmortem was conducted in Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital following the metropolitan magistrate’s orders, as the death occurred in judicial custody. Agra district magistrate Prabhu N Singh said that whatever help is needed by the family will be provided by the administration after assessing the case. BJP MLA from Fatehabad, Jitendra Verma, and former MLA Raja Mahendra Aridman Singh who visited the family gave them cheques of Rs 5 lakh and Rs 1 lakh respectively. On March 25, Dharmendra was picked up by police, saying there was a meeting of all dhaba owners at the police station before the panchayat elections. The next day, he was sent to jail. Police, however, claimed he had been arrested for dealing in spurious liquor and he also had a criminal history. On April 3, his family got a word that he had fallen sick and was admitted to Agra’s SN Medical College. Before the family could get there, Dharmendra had been moved to Delhi’s Maharishi Valmiki Infectious Diseases Hospital on April 4 at 2.45am with symptoms of rabies— hydrophobia and aerophobia. His family, however, dismissed this possibility. “He had never been bitten by a dog,” claimed the deceased’s brother Mukesh. “At the Delhi hospital, when we saw him, he told us he had been badly beaten up, given electric shocks and was threatened to be killed in an encounter. He was asked to run away from custody and when he refused, they poured petrol on his private parts.” He died on April 4 at 7pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/custodial-torture-death-family-protests-cremates-body-after-probe-is-ordered/articleshow/81974903.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Goa||Govt Must Stand Firm||Goa’s infamous taxi mafia is at it again: Threatening the government, putting public and tourists to inconvenience and coming out with unreasonable demands. This time it is a strike against scrapping GoaMiles, an app-based taxi service. That they did not find much resonance to their demand among their members itself shows that their irrational behaviour always doesn’t find takers. The high-handedness with which they have operated for so many years clearly shows the political patronage they have enjoyed. The government has stood firm till now and transport minister Mauvin Godinho has categorically stated that they will not scrap GoaMiles. The government has also invited the taxi operators for talks to hear their grievances and even offered to install digital meters free for all the taxis in the state. The taxi operators have never allowed app-based services to enter Goaand the politicians, for a few votes, have always preferred to inconvenience Goans and the tourists. CM Pramod Sawant has so far stood his ground against the strongarm tactics of these taxi unions and shown that he has the political will to handle the thuggery. The time has come for him to act and ensure these taxi operators fall in line.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-must-stand-firm/articleshow/81977320.cms||---

Lakshmi is one among the six selected women researchers from Brazil, India, Egypt, Kenya and South Africa. The project will be guided by Kim Thompson and David Smith of Moredun Research Institute, Scotland, and will be performed in cooperation with The Roslin Institute, UK. “India stands second in global production of tilapia and now there is no preventive medicine against mortality caused by this virus. Tilapia farmers will face huge losses if this virus enters a single farm in an area,” said Lakshmi, who has completed her fellowship project supported by the department of health research (DHR) under the health ministry. The project is with an initial grant offer of Rs 46.22 lakh for 10 months. Lakshmi will be working seven months in India and the rest three months in the UK. “The topic is of global interest. It is particularly relevant for the development of India and other low-income countries, where fish health management has significantly dampened due to infectious diseases,” she said. As a part of this project, collaborating research experts from the UK will visit India. The project aims to improve the sustainability of tilapia aquaculture in India by developing a nanoparticle-coupled vaccine against TiLV. TiLV is one of the primary concerns for tilapia farming worldwide. In India, disease outbreaks and mass mortality of more than 85% has been reported. The study is expected to have the potential to control TiLV infections thereby allowing sustainable expansion of India’s tilapia aquaculture industry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/scientist-from-kochi-bags-intl-grant/articleshow/81975984.cms||Sudha Nambudiri
---||Delhi||Minor apprehended for stalking, threatening girl||New Delhi: Delhi Police has apprehended a juvenile who allegedly threatened a girl on social media to establish sexual relations with him. The matter came to light on Wednesday when the girl, a resident of Jagatpuri, gave a police complaint alleging that someone was stalking her on Instagram and sending her obscene messages, pictures and videos despite her repeated objections. The girl told the police that the person was harassing her to have sexual relations with him. Acting on the girl’s complaint, the cops immediately collected all the relevant information and analysed the email IDs and social media accounts used by the suspect. “It was established that the culprit was using virtual private networks to access the email account. The cyber cell team then tactfully used forensic tools to zero down on the culprit and on the basis of technical surveillance, identified the suspect as a 17-year-old boy from Krishna Nagar,” said a senior police officer. Following a raid, a police team apprehended the boy from his house. He is a student of Class XI. He was produced before the juvenile justice board and later sent to a correction home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/minor-apprehended-for-stalking-threatening-girl/articleshow/81977318.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Police claimed it to be a case of suicide.Nirdosh, in his mid-30s, was arrested in a murder case in 2010 from Jaitpur police station in Delhi. The body was found at his residence in Dehpa village under Pilkhuwa police station in UP’s Hapur district. The murder weapon was not recovered from the spot, police said. According to police, his parole was about to end and he most likely killed himself under depression. “His parole was about to end. He had a point-blank bullet injury though the weapon was not recovered from the spot. Live cartridges were recovered from his pocket,” Sarvesh Mishra, Hapur additional superintendent of police, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-man-on-parole-from-delhis-tihar-found-dead-with-bullet-injury-police-claim-it-to-be-suicide/articleshow/81974934.cms||---
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Hapur autos get special ID for tracking||MEERUT: About two weeks ago, a woman, 30, from Noida on her way back home from work hailed an auto. There were three men inside — it was a shared auto. After she got in, she was allegedly abducted, taken to a desolate spot in Hapur and gangraped. But CCTV cameras could not offer a look at the registration number of the vehicle and it took days for the police to arrest the three suspects. With the growing instances of such crimes, Hapur Police has come up with an initiative to make it easier to track autos — a four-digit ID in addition to the registration number. “Often, the registration number at the back of the vehicle is not captured on CCTV cameras. That makes it difficult to trace autos when a crime takes place. "The four-digit ID will instantly help us identify the vehicle by matching it with our database,” Mishra added. “It’s also easier to memorise than registration numbers.” The code begins with an ‘H’, for Hapur, and is followed by four digits, the first of which refers to the route the auto plies. The four-digit code has to be displayed in a large, bold font on the sides of the vehicle and at the rear. Besides, the driver’s complete information has to be displayed on a plate, much like a registration plate, at the rear. “It is a good move. It will be easy to remember the number in case we forget something in an auto too,” said a commuter. By now, the exercise has covered 4,167 of 7,125 autos in the district. Last year, Visakhapatnam had, in a similar project, attached tracking devices to 1,000 autos in the city and assigned QR codes to each in a pilot project to curb crimes against women. At the beginning of a trip, the rider has to scan the QR code or enter the registration number and then enter the destination. A mobile app can be used to send a distress signal, to which a command control room responds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/noida-gangrape-fallout-hapur-autos-given-spl-4-digit-ids-for-fast-tracking/articleshow/81974928.cms||Piyush Rai
---||Ahmedabad||Companies come calling at GIFT City||AHMEDABAD: The development commissioner for the special economic zone at Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City) received a record number of applications for setting up international finance service operations. At a time when the special economic zones in the country are facing the brunt of global slowdown on businesses, GIFT City SEZ that houses the country’s first International Finance Service Centre (IFSC) has received a dozen proposals that came up for clearance before the development commissioner on Wednesday, said sources in the state government. One of the main reasons for the large number of companies lining up at GIFT IFSC is the formation of the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA). “This has smoothened the application process and companies are finding it easier to move their proposals faster. Earlier, the proposals had to be cleared by multiple authorities like the Reserve Bank of India and the stock exchange regulator,” said a senior government official. In the last one month, about 25 companies, including the 12 new ones, have lined up their investment proposals at GIFT IFSC, he added. With this, the country’s first aircraft leasing services activity has finally got wings with the SEZ development authority likely to clear the decks for Acumen Aviation and VMan Aero Services to set up their shops at GIFT City IFSC, said sources. The dozen proposals also include Singapore Stock Exchange setting up its first subsidiary in India called SGX Indian Connect IFSC. Other proposals include five fund management entities including DSP Asset Managers, Kedaara Capital and Rising Fintech, among others. In February, the IFSCA came out with a special framework to enable setting up of aircraft leasing and ancillary services. As a result, entities in this area who were earlier forced to look for options at overseas IFSCs, could now set up their operations at the Indian IFSC centre at GIFT City. VMan Aero Services, which was planning to set up its operations in Abu Dhabi or Ireland, changed its plans and decided to move to GIFT City after the IFSCA announced new set of guidelines for aircraft leasing services on February 19. Vishok Mansingh, CEO of Vman Aero Services, confirmed, “We were planning to set up our operations in Ireland or Abu Dhabi when the new framework for aircraft leasing and asset management activities was declared by IFSCA. The proactive support from IFSCA , the unified regulator, is helping the industry move faster and develop a new line of business in India. The Indian aviation industry has seen a lot of positive changes in the last six years or so in all areas including ease of doing business.” “We are seeing great interest from financial services players in setting up business in fund, aircraft leasing, banking and ancillary services. IFSC in India has potential to emerge as a leading IFSCs,” said Dipesh Shah, Head Development, International Financial Services Centres Authority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/companies-come-calling-at-gift-city/articleshow/81976006.cms||---

He was alone and we guys can kill him very easily!!” Delta command said, “See, that’s not how it looks like if we were to kill him, he will start his magnetic force and grab our guns! Also, he is 23X and has more speed than us. 98% accuracy and 54% eyesight.” But he did not do anything like that, said Jack. Ahmedabad: These are excerpts from a novel written by 11-year-old Shaurya Mishra, who resides in Prahladnagar area of Ahmedabad. The setting of his fiction novel is unearthly however, for it’s in space! The title of the book is ‘Space Mafia On The Loose.’ Chief minister Vijay Rupani lauded the young child for achieving the remarkable feat. “Your entire book, full of space achievement, is imagined very bravely, compiled, completed and created during the lockdown period,” the chief minister wrote in a letter addressed to Shaurya, a student of DPS School, Ahmedabad. The young child developed interest in the space at a young age of 7. His mother, Shreya Mishra, a qualified lawyer, got him an encyclopedia on space with several colourful images taken by NASA. Shaurya’s father Bimlesh Mishra is working as a senior executive with an overseas NGO. “A year later, I also gifted him a telescope through which Shaurya and his twin brother Yuvraj would observe Moon and Mars, staying mesmerized by the enchanting beauty of space, night after night,” said Shreya Mishra. Later, they also visited the planetarium in Delhi. Shaurya would spend hours talking about becoming an astronaut who would visit space and make a first telephonic call to his mother from his space rocket. He got interested in everything related to space and then got hooked to an online game called ‘Among Us’ which takes place on a space observatory. Shaurya would weave stories on different subjects. He used to visit a bookstore every fortnight and would spend an hour or two reading books there and purchasing them. All this came to a grinding halt when the Covid-19-induced lockdown was announced last year in March. That’s when his mother asked him to write down his thoughts in a diary. This got him thinking and he decided to write his own story. He was given an old cellphone without sim card by his mother to learn sketching. He utilized this source and lockdown period and wrote down ‘Space Mafia On Loose’ in a short span of two months. “Writing runs in his blood. His maternal great-grandfather Dr Bhagwati Sharan Mishra, a retired IAS officer, is a well-known writer. Also, Shaurya’s maternal grandmother advocate Chhaya Mishra writes stories and poems,” said Shreya Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/11-yr-old-pens-space-fiction-during-lockdown/articleshow/81976014.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||MC polls a morale booster for Cong, eye-opener for BJP||Shimla: Congress has finally managed to stop the winning streak of BJP by clinching two municipal corporations seats out of four, voting for which was held on April 7. The Congress has a clear majority in Palampur and Solan municipal corporations. Victory in two municipal corporations before the assembly elections next year is a morale booster for the Congress cadre. The perception is that this indicates that the party is slowly regaining lost ground after the crushing defeat of 2019 parliamentary elections and assembly byelections of Pachhad and Dharamshala. The results are also an eye-opener for the BJP, which will have to revise its strategy for ‘Mission Repeat’ in the 2022 assembly elections. Of the total of 15 seats of Mandi Municipal Corporation, BJP has won 11 and Congress four. In Dharamshala, of the 17 seats, BJP has won eight, Congress five and independents four. Of the 17 seats in Solan municipal corporation, Congress won nine, BJP seven while one seat went to an independent candidate. In Palampur, of the 15 seats, Congress won 11, BJP two and independents two. Of the 64 seats in all four municipal corporations, 29 have gone to the Congress and 28 to the BJP. CPM and AAP have failed to clinch any seat anywhere. Addressing media persons in Shimla on Thursday, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said that in Solan, BJP has received over 10,000 votes while Congress has received only around 9,000 votes. He said his party BJP would assess the reasons that led to the its defeat in Palampur and Solan. Along with municipal corporations, elections were held to some panchayats and municipal councils and BJP won in six municipal councils, he said. Local issues dominated the MC elections and presence of rebels played spoilsport, because of which both Congress and BJP suffered, he added. State Congress president Kuldeep Singh Rathore claimed that despite BJP being in power, it could only win with clear majority in Mandi municipal corporation, the chief minister’s home district. In Dharamshala, BJP did not get a clear majority despite blatant misuse of power, he added. Rathore said after the panchayati raj elections, he had openly challenged the chief minister to conduct municipal corporation elections on party symbol. “BJP had earlier termed these elections as semi-final to 2022 legislative assembly elections and the results have proved that BJP has lost people’s faith,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-polls-a-morale-booster-for-cong-eye-opener-for-bjp/articleshow/81977319.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Love jihad, temples’ liberation main agenda of VHP meeting in Haridwar||LUCKNOW: The raging issues of ‘Love Jihad’ and government control over temples in the country are set to reverberate at the meeting of Margdarshak mandal, the highest decision making body of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), scheduled in Haridwar on Friday. Confirming this, VHP working president Alok Kumar told TOI that the issues happen to be national concern and are directly related to welfare of the Hindu community. The meeting of mandal happens twice a year.“We need to take them to the margdarshak mandal (comprising a host of prominent seers) which would decide the future course of action and the agenda ahead,” he said. The agenda set by the margdarshak mandal is subsequently followed up by the Sanghparivar, experts said. The VHP was initially planning to defer the meeting in the wake of the spike in corona case but eventually decided to go ahead with it. Besides a host of seers, the meeting will be attended by mandal convener Jeeveshwar Mishra, Alok Kumar, VHP international vice-president and general secretary of Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, Champat Rai and VHP secretary general, Milind Parende. Kumar said that parishad would seek the guidance of seers on the proposed campaign for liberation of temples from government control. “It is only temples which are statutorily managed by the government in various states. This has been a very unsatisfactory state of affairs. The temple properties are being acquired and ‘Shashtra Vidhi’ is not observed,” he said, adding that an alternative structure for the maintenance of temples also needs to be put in place. The VHP brass would also discuss the progress of crowd funding for the Ram temple project in Ayodhya. Kumar said it was a matter of great satisfaction that the parishad managed to reach out to 5.5 lakh villages across the country to collect public funds for the project. “Nearly 65 crore people gave donations for the temples liberally,” he said. The VHP is also expected to review some of its regular projects including pursuance of `Samajik Samrasta’ (social harmony) and voluntary effort for socio-economic development of Dalits. Experts said that the RSS and the VHP have been working amongst the socially oppressed classes through multiple programmes, in what has eventually helped the BJP consolidate its position amongst Dalits who happen to be electorally prominent. Sources said that the VHP is also scheduled to review the progress of `Ghar Wapsi’ of Hindus. The parishad stance comes days after a host of BJP ruled states including Uttar Pradesh brought in a stringent law against forced religious conversion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vhp-meet-love-jihad-temples-on-agenda/articleshow/81978513.cms||Pankaj Shah

According to the statistics, as many as 214 patients in the age group of 21-40 years have tested positive for Covid-19 over the past one week. The number accounts for 36% of the total 589 patients who tested positive in the duration. In the same period, a 65-year-old man and a 26-year-old woman succumbed to the infection. On Thursday, 165 Covid-19 positive cases were detected in Meerut, taking the tally to 22,573 since the outbreak of the pandemic. In view of the spurt in cases, Meerut district magistrate K Balaji has imposed a night curfew from 10 pm to 5 am in the district till April 18. He has ordered that all schools and colleges to remain closed till then. Meanwhile, Covid-19 vaccination is on in full swing in the district “As many as 214 people in the age group of 21-40 years have tested positive for Covid-19 in Meerut in the last one week. This accounts for 36% of the total 589 cases which were reported in the said period,” said the report of the health department. When the cases had peaked in August and September, 2020, as many as 4,158 patients had tested positive for Covid-19. Out of these, 1,911 patients had tested positive in August and 2,247 had tested positive in September. While in August, as many as 910 patients were less than 40 years old, in September, 1,000 were below the age of 40. Dr Akhilesh Mohan, chief medical officer, Meerut, said, “While the effect of Covid-19 virus is on the people of all age groups, youngsters are the most exposed because they tend to skip wearing masks. The only way to remain safe is to follow the norms of wearing a mask and maintaining social distancing.” In an earlier report, TOI had quoted Dr Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS, New Delhi, as saying, “Younger people are going out a lot. They feel even if they are infected, it will only cause mild symptoms.” He had added that it was important to realize that the youngsters could become super-spreaders if they do not follow Covid-appropriate behavior while going out and this would eventually lead to more cases among high-risk groups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/youngsters-account-for-36-of-covid-19-cases-in-meerut-says-report/articleshow/81974943.cms||Ishita Bhatia
---||Delhi||Some lawyers feel routine work will suffer, others favour move||New Delhi: The unprecedented situation of courts shifting judicial proceedings to the virtual mode last year is back again owing to the surge in Covid-19 cases, albeit only till April 23. Lawyers have given mixed reactions to this move, from welcoming it to expressing reservations on it. Post lockdown, a majority of the district courts put all necessary precautions in place to function physically in tandem with some leeway for virtual hearings. With the situation changing again, advocate Ashima Mandla said, “If the government says that we have to learn to live with the virus, then why are these restrictions being placed? The curbs won’t curtail the infection. The only thing being curtailed is the economy.” Advocate Amresh Anand stressed that though the shift to videoconferencing was a welcome step, lawyers who earned from miscellaneous court appearances and daily work were likely to face the brunt. “A large segment of lawyers still face difficulties during virtual appearances. With strict adherence to precautionary measures, the risk can be minimised,” he added. Recalling an appearance before district judge Nivedita Anil Sharma at Karkardooma courts, where only three lawyers were allowed inside, Anand said, “Even those having their masks below their noses weren’t permitted.” However, advocate Arpit Bhargava differed in opinion saying virtual hearings, with physical hearings being an exception, were the future. “Resorting back to the virtual space is a blessing in disguise. Physical hearings resumed under pressure from top members of the bar, especially when courts were functioning well virtually. We have seen the results and have been compelled to go back to virtual hearings,” he added. “It’s unfortunate that instead of investing in infrastructure, taking into account long-term solutions for judges and advocates, short-term gains and personal interests were seen and pressure was built to switch to physical hearings. Even judges and court staffers have families and are more vulnerable as they have to handle 50-60 files every day, besides interacting with several people,” said Bhargava. Advocate Soutik Banerjee voiced a similar opinion saying the situation in district courts was “really bad” owing to overcrowding and minimal safety norms. “Fortunately, district courts have already put in place a largely effective mode of virtual hearings. Physical hearings place judicial officers, courts and registry staffers at peril. Recording of evidence in the virtual mode can be challenging, but courts have to be willing to cope with it,” he added. On the other hand, advocate Manoj Taneja lauded the high court’s decision saying it was just and proper keeping in view the interest of the entire legal fraternity. “Courtrooms were getting crowded and there was no mode to control it. Many court staffers, prosecutors and even judges have tested positive for the infection,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/some-lawyers-feel-routine-work-will-suffer-others-favour-move/articleshow/81977331.cms||Aamir Khan
---||Chandigarh||Haryana: Ashok Khemka cuts revenue court pendency||CHANDIGARH: Nearly half the cases of revenue courts of Haryana financial commissioners have been decided by senior state bureaucrat Ashok Khemka in the last financial year. The 18 revenue courts presided by financial commissioners of Haryana had decided 279 cases related to revenue matters pertaining to various districts from April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021. Of these 279 cases, 121 cases were decided by Khemka while presiding over the revenue court, which constitutes 43.4% of the total cases, decided or adjudicated by all financial commissioners of the state. According to data, as on April 1, 2021, pendency of cases in the court of Ashok Khemka was 30 only, against the state-wide pendency of 2,015 cases. Interestingly, pendency of cases before some of the revenue courts of financial commissioners is above 100 or even 200. Some of the bureaucrats did not decide a single case during this period. These revenue courts of financial commissioners, who are senior IAS officers, adjudicate the revision petitions filed against the orders of revenue courts of collectors or divisional commissioners of various districts. The senior bureaucrats preside over revenue courts exercising quasi-judicial powers, apart from discharging their duties while hearing other departments of the state government. Every financial commissioner presiding over the revenue court is allotted different districts as per the roster. Of the 18 revenue courts, 16 are single benches and two are division benches presided over by senior IAS officers of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/around-half-of-cases-in-hry-revenue-courts-decided-by-khemka/articleshow/81977323.cms||Ajay Sura

While the priest had died of a heart attack six days ago, Meena and his supporters alleged that he died from the shock after his land was illegally grabbed by land mafia. It was a failure of police intelligence as they were clueless about Meena’s plans and his move to shift the body from Dausa to Jaipur overnight. “There has been an uproar over the priest’s death for the last six days in Dausa’s Mahwa area. We want justice for the priest who died after his land was illegally grabbed by land sharks,” Meena told reporters. “I brought the body to Jaipur following an order of the state president. For six days, we have been fighting the battle for justice. The Brahmin community is demanding justice, but no action has been taken against the land mafia,” he added. "The body will remain here until the demands are met,” he added. Meanwhile, the police in plain clothes suspect that the box could be empty as there was no stink coming from the wooden box in which the body is said to be kept. “If the body is six days old, there has to be a stink and the protesters must arrange for ice to ensure that the body is not decomposed.  It appears that there is nothing in the box. Our men in plain clothes are at the spot and we are monitoring the situation,” said a senior officer on condition of anonymity. When contacted, police commissioner Anand Srivastav said, “Adequate force has been deployed in the area and we will ensure that no law and order problem occurs. Protesters had talks with the government. We are monitoring the situation.” Other BJP leaders also joined the dharna and said that they would continue until the demands are met. Jaipur BJP MP Ramcharan Bohra and former party president Arun Chaturvedi alleged that priests were being killed in Rajasthan. According to officials, the priest was in shock after his land was allegedly grabbed by land sharks. He was admitted to Mahwa community health centre on March 29 and was referred to Jaipur on March 30 in a critical condition. On April 2, he died while undergoing treatment at SMS Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/kirori-stages-dharna-with-body-of-priest-near-civil-lines-cops-clueless/articleshow/81977322.cms||---
---||Chennai||FASTag has caused congestion: HC||Chennai: Introduction of electronic highway toll payment through FASTag has resulted in creating more congestion in toll plazas instead of reducing the waiting time, said the Madras high court on Thursday. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) should have created some amount of infrastructural setup prior to introducing FASTag, the first bench of chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said. The court made the observations while hearing a plea to restrain NHAI from collecting user fee at Chengalpet’s Paranur toll plaza between Tambaram and Tindivanam highway. The petitioner claimed that the contract awarded to the concessionaire has expired. When the plea moved by A Joseph Sagayaraj came up for hearing, the bench said the present system remained inaccessible to several roadusers. Opposing the plea, assistant solicitor-general of India G Karthikeyan submitted that NHAI, which is maintaining the highway, is entitled to collect 40% of user fee as per Rule 6 (6)(b) of the National Highway Fee (determination of rates and collection) Rules, 2008. Recording the submissions, the bench directed the NHAI to submit additional information on the present user fee levied on each of the vehicles in the stretch. According to the petitioner, the contract awarded to the concessionaire has expired. Therefore, NHAI is entitled to collect only 40% as per the rules. He said the toll is being collected with aid of provisional completion certificate awarded in favour of the concessionaire, despite the said provisional completion certificate indicating very many deficiencies. Responding to the plea, NHAI submitted that cogent reading of Rule 1(4) and Rule 6(6)(b) of the Rules would make it clear that the build-operate-transfer (BOT) (Annuity) projects are public-funded projects and NHAI is authorised to collect user fee from roadusers till the entire capital cost of the project is fully recovered as per the applicable financial practices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/fastag-has-caused-congestion-hc/articleshow/81976026.cms||---

GFP has written to chief secretary Parimal Rai pointing out that several government employees who retired in 2016 and later are yet to receive their pension. “It is demanded to constitute a committee under your chairmanship or with finance secretary as chairman and having all heads of departments as members and director of accounts as member secretary to meet quarterly and review of all pending pension cases and also of the employees who are likely to retire within two years and initiate action timely settlement of the pension,” said John Nazareth, convenor of GFP’s wing for employees. GFP has highlighted the case of Madan Naik, a former driver with the directorate of panchayats, who retired in June 2018. Nazareth said Naik’s pension case has not been settled till date and he has to rely on petty odd jobs or borrowed funds to meet his daily expenses. Nazareth pointed out that delay in settlement of pension requires penal interest to be paid to the pensioner. He said pension revision cases are pending with various departments. It also urged the government to allot office space in the state capital for a pensioners association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/settle-pension-cases-quickly-gfp-to-govt/articleshow/81977336.cms||---

The appointments on PMDS are made for five years. However, citing the need for better management, the government’s law and judiciary department has issued the notification dissolving the memberships. Between 2010 to 2017, there were no appointments on the PMDS and the administration was looked after by the district collector of Kolhapur. In 2017, the then Bharatiya Janata Party-led government had appointed Mahesh Jadhav, a close confidante of state BJP president Chandrakant Patil as the chairman of the PMDS. The notification issued on Thursday states, ‘Government of Maharashtra is of the opinion that for better management and administration of the endowments, the management of the endowments should be taken over temporarily by the state government.’ Now, as the members are terminated, the government has appointed district collector Daulat Desai as the administrator of the PMDS for period of one year. Meanwhile, outgoing chairman Mahesh Jadhav, said, “I have not received any letter from the government, but have got the notification, which is in public domain. I have apprised our leader Chandrakant Patil about the development.” After the MVA government was formed, there were talks that the BJP-appointed members on major temple management committees in the state would be terminated. Several Nationalist Congress Party and Congress Party leaders are lobbying hard to get key positions on PMDS. Bhaiyya Mane, NCP leader and close confidante of senior minister Hasan Mushrif, is seen as a top contender to the PMDS chairman post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/govt-ends-pmds-panel-memberships/articleshow/81974208.cms||---

The speaker, who was served a notice to appear before the agency’s Kochi office, is learnt to have sent an email to Customs that he would appear before the agency on a later date due to medical reasons. It was the second notice issued to the speaker by the Commissionerate of Customs (Preventive). Customs would decide on issuing a third notice to him soon. The currency smuggling case was registered based on a revelation by the accused in the Thiruvananthapuram gold smuggling case that 1.9 lakh US dollars (equivalent to Rs.1.30 crore approximately) was smuggled out by Khaled Ali Shoukry, a former staffer of the UAE consulate Thiruvananthapuram while travelling to Cairo in August 2019. Later on, accused Swapna Suresh and Sarith PS gave a statement before the magistrate that the speaker had also handed over a bag containing currencies to them to be smuggled abroad. The accused had also alleged that Sreeramakrishnan had investments in Oman and he was trying to expand educational business to Sharjah. Customs had arrested former principal secretary M Sivasankar as well in the case. The agency had claimed that the statements given by Suresh and Sarith point to the fact that Sivasankar has colluded with them in awarding the contracts of Life Mission project to Unitac Builders, which facilitated receipt of commissions by the UAE Consulate officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/speaker-skips-summons-from-customs-again-cites-ill-health/articleshow/81976031.cms||---

The exams that were to be held on April 10 will now be held on May 7, it said. The timing of the entrance test will be from 11am to 2pm. The decision has been taken keeping in view the Covid-19 situation in the state and the steps taken by the state government to check its spread. The university had recently reschedule college exams for postgraduate medical students. The medical colleges affiliated with Gujarat University include B J Medical College and Civil Hospital, GMERS Medical College and Hospital (Sola), NHL Municipal Medical College and GMERS Medical College, Gandhinagar. Also, in a separate announcement, the varsity had, earlier this week, decided to put the exams for arts, commerce, science and law students on hold. The new dates for the exams will be announced later on, it said.

---||Delhi||As Covid cases spike, Delhi HC and district courts to hold virtual hearings for 2 weeks||NEW DELHI: Taking note of the “alarming rise” in Covid 19 cases, the Delhi high court has decided to hold proceedings through virtual mode only from April 9 to April 23. A Full Court meeting of judges of the high court decided that district courts across the city will also take up matters through virtual mode only till April 24. The Full Court, which was convened virtually by chief justice DN Patel, decided that during this two-week period, joint registrars and district courts will not pass any adverse orders if a litigant or lawyer is unable to appear via videoconferencing. Sources said, while initially there was a discussion to scale down the court functioning by 50%, several judges made a compelling argument to go fully virtual in the wake of the steep rise in cases and the fact that district courts see massive footfall and can become super spreaders. An office order issued later in the evening by registrar general Manoj Jain said, matters fixed for recording of evidence before the joint registrars and district courts shall be adjourned. The order also asked all district judges to ensure proceedings are held via virtual mode only from April 9 to April 24 and videoconferencing links are made available on the website/causelist. “It has been further directed that the principal district and sessions judges in consultation with the DG (prisons) shall make necessary arrangements for extension of remand of undertrial prisoners (UTPs). Wherever required, during the trial, UTPs may be produced through videoconferencing,” the order added. Following the outbreak of Covid-19 in March last year, the court was holding proceedings through videoconferencing for several months and its functioning was restricted to urgent matters from March 16 last year. From March 25 last year, the functioning of the high court and district courts was further restricted and no physical hearing was being conducted. Subsequently, from September last year, a few benches started holding physical courts everyday on a rotation basis. Some of them were even holding hybrid proceedings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-covid-cases-spike-hc-and-district-courts-to-hold-virtual-hearings-for-2-wks/articleshow/81977343.cms||Abhinav Garg

For the Rs 40 crore project, 22 trees will be cut. The project has been awarded without floating tenders. However, neither a public notice has been issued nor suggestions and objections been taken from citizens before hacking the trees, as mandated by Tree Authority norms. The garden was fenced off last week and work to dig it up for the tank began. BMC’s Garden Department has written to the Storm Water Drain (SWD) department, that is carrying out the work, saying that it doesn’t have the nod to hack 22 trees. BMC officials said permission to hack trees can be taken from municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal as the number of trees to be hacked is less than 25. However, even for that a public notice has to be issued and suggestions and objections from citizens sought. “After our letter, SWD department submitted a proposal to hack trees... They were going ahead with work, without the nod,” said an official. Activist Zoru Bhathena said it is mandatory to issue a public notice before cutting trees. “Regardless of the number, a public notice must be issued and suggestions and objections taken from citizens,” Bhathena said. Additional municipal commissioner (Projects) P Velrasu said, “...Tender procedure is not possible given the shortage of time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/22-trees-to-be-axed-as-bmc-starts-work-on-tank-at-garden-in-mumbai/articleshow/81978557.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Shoppers flood markets in Kolar, Shahpura after lockdown||BHOPAL: Abrupt decision of the district administration to impose 10-day lockdown in Kolar and Shahpura came as a raw jolt to residents of the area.  Within minutes, roads in the two areas were flooded with cars and two-wheelers with people rushing to market to stock essentials for the lockdown period.  Traffic snarls could be seen at several places as everybody appeared to be in a hurry to get to the market. Bank ATMs, grocery shops, vegetable markets were all flooded with people, though the lockdown will come into effect at 6.00 pm on Friday. Queue of customers could be seen in supermarkets of the areas with the staff hard-pressed to get people to stand in circles drawn outside the stores. “A decision like lockdown should be communicated at least two day in advance. Otherwise, the very purpose of lockdown is defeated as people rush to markets, roads get jammed and there are people all around”, said Shishir Khare, a resident of Shahpura, who had come to a supermarket for purchase of grocery items and vegetables. Though the administration said that vegetable supply would be maintained through vendors authorised by the BMC but peoples’ experience during the lockdown previous year, when many families had to do without vegetables and fruits for days together made people to stock vegetables and fruits, too, in addition to grocery. Both Shahpura and Kolar are mainly residential areas and there is a sizeable population of retired persons in the areas, many of them not having their children in Bhopal. It’s they who face problems in arranging essentials for themselves. “I live here with my wife. My son is in Bangalore and daughter is married at Nasik. I didn’t know about the lockdown till Sanjay, who lives by the side of our house, came and told me that the area has been put under lockdown from tomorrow. Now, I am rushing to market to get t5hings, which my wife has spelt out in the list”, said Radhakrishna Sharma, a retired teacher. Spokesperson for the district administration, Arun Rathore, made it clear that Coronavirus vaccination work would continue in the areas under lockdown. When asked how people would be able to reach the vaccination centres, he said “They should carry their Adhar card, which is seen at the vaccination centres as well. If they are above 45 and going for vaccination, they will not be stopped”, he said. Newspaper vendors will be allowed to distribute newspapers and Sanchi parlours will also open for distribution of milk. Grocery can be ordered online from supermarkets like Reliance Fresh and D Mart and even grocery traders in the neighbourhood can supply grocery with the permission of SDM. Banks, ATMs and government offices will remain open in the lockdown areas on working days and government servants living in the areas will also be exempt from lockdown for the purpose of going to office and come back. Essential services will also be exempted from lockdown restrictions. District collector, Avinash Lavania, said that lockdown had to be imposed in these areas because 40 percent of active Coronavirus cases are from these areas only and in the last 10 days, 1800 new Coronavirus cases have been found in the localities being put under lockdown. He further said that vaccination work would continue in the areas under lockdown and appealed to all the people beyond 45 years of age to get themselves vaccinated and motivate others as well for the purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/shoppers-flood-mkts-in-kolar-shahpura-after-lockdown/articleshow/81976029.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

The shops will open on Monday," said FTAP president Fatehchand Ranka.He said the traders held a meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray who assured a breakthrough in two days and urged the traders not to resort to agitation. On Thursday, traders, wearing black badges, staged demonstrations on Laxmi Road, condemning the state government’s order to keep non-essential shops shut till April 30. The demonstration was organised by FTAP. The shopkeepers displayed placards and raised slogans condemning the decision. Meanwhile, the Vishrambaug police on Thursday night registered a case against Ranka and 35 others for protesting on Laxmi Road.“We have registered a case against the traders under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC,” said police inspector Sanjay Mogale of Vishrambaug police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/protesting-traders-postpone-decision-to-reopen-shops/articleshow/81976035.cms||Sarang Dastane

If the discussions in LDF and UDF are mostly around the possibility of either of them coming to power with a comfortable, if not wafer-thin majority, the best of the possibilities that leaders in the NDA camp nurse is a hung assembly in which NDA may emerge as a decisive factor. The assembly segment-level calculations done by BJP on the ground level, in almost all seats, predicted chances in high number of seats. However, the leadership is not ready to go by those figures. It would wait for the assessment of RSS functionaries who were in charge of each of the seat to deduce a realistic figure from the ground reports. Several state-level leaders of BJP shared the opinion that if there was a favourable political tilt towards BJP, the numbers could even crossfrom three to 15. A realistic assessment, say many, is that BJP candidates hold a 50:50 chance in winning at least six seats where BJP candidates took LDF or UDF, head on. Some senior leaders said BJP is hopeful of winning Manjeswaram where the party president K Surendran had almost got through in 2016. “A detailed review has proven that close to 300 BJP votes were not polled in the election in 2016 when Surendran lost the seat for 89 votes. The vote trade allegations that CPM and Congress leaders trade against each other in Manjeswaram is seen as a good indicator in favour of BJP,” said a BJP state committee member. The seat that BJP is confident of a win after Manjeswaram and Nemom is Palakkad where E Sreedharan has put up a spirited fight against Congress’ sitting MLA Shafi Parambil. The constituencies which the BJP think can go either way are Kazhakkoottam, Thrissur, Chathannoor, Malampuzha, Vattiyoorkavu and Thiruvananthapuram. BJP had either come second in all except Thrissur seat in the 2016 elections. However, since actor and MP Suresh Gopi had won votes in large numbers from Thrissur in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the party lays high hopes in the seat. BJP leaders are also of the opinion that the decision to field K Surendran in two seats has helped the party to avoid religious and political consolidation against him in Manjeswaram. In all these seats, BJP has a solid and sizeable vote share and victory in these seats could be counted as hard earned, political ones. If the Sabarimala issue has clicked in favour of BJP, the number of seats the party would get would be much more. The BJP core committee is expected to meet next week after its state president K Surendran is back in the state capital by this weekend.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/bjp-hopeful-of-winning-minimum-three-seats/articleshow/81976056.cms||B S Anilkumar

A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli made it clear that such conduct will not be tolerated and warned of stern action against the erring union leaders and their members. The MCD Swachhata Karamchari Union leaders, who gave the strike call, appeared before the court and assured it that they will not resort to any such conduct in future. “We have impressed upon the president and secretary of the union that though they are entitled to exercise their rights as provided by the law to raise their grievances, they do not have a right to create nuisance and take law in their hands by spilling garbage on roads and restraining others from performing their duties,” the bench reminded the unions, disposing of a petition by East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) seeking direction to Delhi Police and Delhi government to ensure that there is no obstruction created for “willing” safai karmcharis coming to work. The corporation had, earlier, complained that several unions called for a strike in March and that they should be restrained from throwing garbage on streets or hampering the functioning of the corporation. The court noted that “If there is a grievance, you (union) have a right to raise it and nobody is taking away your right. But you cannot create nuisance and ‘gundagardi’. We will not allow this and will come down heavily with an iron hand... Spilling of garbage on streets is not allowed and you cannot restrain others from doing their duties.” In its plea, EDMC had also sought direction to the authorities to provide necessary assistance so that day-to-day operations of the corporation can be run smoothly and no inconvenience is caused to the general public. A batch of petitions raising grievances regarding non-payment of salaries to all classes of municipal employees is pending before the high court, which has been passing orders, as a result of which, all Group D employees have been paid their outstanding salaries till December, 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-warns-safai-unions-against-gundagardi/articleshow/81977357.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘A newer variant is at play; local lockdowns could help’||Variants of SARS-CoV-2 are behind the second wave in Maharashtra, said Dr Giridhara R Babu, professor of epidemiology at the Public Health Foundation of India, in an interview with Malathy Iyer. And, if steps such as identifying the mutation, banning gatherings of more than 10 or imposing restrictive measures such as local ‘lockdowns’ are not implemented soon in the rest of India, then the ‘Maharashtra problem’ could be repeated elsewhere. Excerpts...Q: What has led to the current ballooning of cases in Maharashtra? Is it only due to poor adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour?A: If lack of Covid-appropriate behaviour is the reason for a surge in cases, then the infection should have peaked all over the country. Any permutation and combination in mathematical modelling done for Mumbai cannot explain how cases have risen to such an extent. This clearly means a newer variant is at play. Q: But the Centre has categorically said that the surge isn’t related to any mutant…A: It is unfortunate that we are left to guess which variant is at play. It is most straightforward to step up resources for genomic sequencing to concurrently carry with epidemiological investigations of the cluster of cases. This would help identify the variants of concern (VOCs). Despite the rise of cases in Maharashtra, this doesn’t seem to be a priority as the mainstay of Covid-19 response in the country. Higher the circulation, more will be the errors and more will be mutations. Some of these mutations lead to newer variants of concern. The penalty (of failing to pinpoint a variant) is that now we can potentially have more variants at play in different parts of the country. Cases will continue to rise to such an extent that Mumbai’s present struggle will be the story everywhere. There is no peak in sight at the moment and cases will continue to rise till the end of April or early May. This means the problem we are seeing in Maharashtra is going to be every state’s problem. Q: Hasn’t Maharashtra failed in checking the surge?A: I have seen Maharashtra and Kerala trying every best public health response and yet have been unable to cope with the rising number of cases. Apart from studying the outbreaks, we have to conduct surveillance using genomic sequencing. We cannot wait to have the results after three months. We have to identify all clusters of cases and subject 5% of these in a representative manner. Not just among cases, the VOCs will have to be detected among contacts. In vitro testing should be done to understand the infectiousness. Once the VOC is identified, we should try to limit its spread...If we don’t, we are in for greater trouble. Q: Is national lockdown an option at all?A: We should not impose a national lockdown...as the poor will be most affected by it. But as the situation is going beyond control, local lockdowns would help. It would take two weeks to show results...and then we have to relax the restrictions gradually. We should begin with defining a crowd. In Japan, two is a crowd. But say in India, we decide that 10 is a crowd. We need to stop crowds of more than 10 then. Lockdown is the last and lazy policy option in the current phase, but in some parts of the country it is needed. Q: Is there anything else that can be done now to control the situation?A: We need to step up surveillance, carry out cluster investigations and genome sequencing in areas where cases are rising. We are seeing 1 lakh cases now and about 5% of them need hospitalisation, but what if we have a peak of 3 lakh, then we need 15,000 new cases a day needing hospitalisation. How will rural India cope with such a burden?||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-a-newer-variant-is-at-play-local-lockdowns-could-help/articleshow/81977366.cms||---
---||Delhi||Corpn plans survey to push vax drive||New Delhi: As Delhi goes for another round of serological survey, North Delhi Municipal Corporation is planning to start a door-to-door survey to collect data on the vaccination status of people. Mayor Jai Prakash said domestic breeding checkers (DBC) would be deployed for this massive exercise. The exercise, which is expected to begin sometime next week, would help collect crucial data and identify localities where awareness campaigns need to be carried out. Apart from around 1,500 DBCs on the rolls of the civic body, officials said other field staff could also be deployed. The mayor said the exercise would be carried out in the form of a campaign to not only help control breeding of mosquitoes, but also provide a boost to vaccinations. A senior civic official said, “For carrying out this exercise, we will use the data of more than 10 lakh properties that have been registered under Unique Property Identification Card system for collecting property tax.” The corporation has six administrative zones, including Karol Bagh, City-Sadar Paharganj, Keshavpuram, Rohini, Civil Lines and Narela. Meanwhile, in the wake of the surge in Covid-19 cases, all three mayors and key functionaries from the three municipal bodies held a meeting in which discussions were held on strategies to augment the infrastructure, enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour and disinfection drives. “The licensing officers have been instructed to ensure that weekly bazaars are wrapped up before the night restrictions kick in. They will also ensure that masks are worn and vendors are allocated space based on social distancing norms,” said Prakash. The civic bodies will once again start making markings on the floor to indicate social distancing in marketplaces. They have already passed orders to reserve funeral platforms for bodies of deceased Covid-19 patients. East Delhi Municipal Corporation on Friday announced that it would provide a 5% additional rebate on house tax to encourage people to get themselves vaccinated. Mayor Nirmal Jain said the rebate would be provided on submitting the proof of vaccination. “Even after vaccination, people should keep wearing masks in public places. We will also increase the frequency of disinfection drives,” he added.

The rest will have to reschedule their operations, though it is a common raw material in manufacturing and engineering,” he said.He said the state Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), which monitors oxygen supply and production, would decide which industry gets the nod. They have so far received applications from 12 industrial units.Nine oxygen manufacturers in Pune and Mumbai cater to the entire state. “Oxygen manufactured in Pune goes to Nanded, Kolhapur, Sangli and Solapur, which puts constraints on the supply chain,” he said. Sandeep Belsare, president of Pimpri Chinchwad Small Industries Association, said restricted oxygen supply was likely to affect 15,000 units in Pimpri Chinchwad, Chakan, Talegaon and Ranjangaon. “As per the order, industrial units that need oxygen as a raw material must seek FDA’s permission by April 10. We request the government to extend this deadline to April 15,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/5-of-oxygen-supply-in-dist-allocated-to-industries/articleshow/81976060.cms||Neha Madaan

The Sinhgad Road police arrested the two jobless youths — Karan Arjun Dalve (19) and Hanuman Vaijnath Junzare (21) — of Vadgaon Budruk on the charges of murder attempt, causing hurt, trespass and violating the Covid-19 norms, among others. “Dalve and Junzare had casually gone to Manikbaug. They spotted a drinking water pot placed near the automation firm’s entrance and went there to drink the water,” senior inspector Devidas Gheware of the Sinhagad Road police said. “While doing so, one of them spit on the staircase nearby. Hanuman Dnyanoba More (29), an employee of the company, saw it and scolded the duo for spitting in times of Covid-19. This led to a heated verbal exchange between them,” he said. “Angered, the duo started pelting stones at More. He ducked in time to save himself, but the stones shattered the glass windowpane of the office,” Gheware said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/row-over-spitting-turns-violent-two-in-police-net/articleshow/81976069.cms||---

Three others, also dalits, were grievously injured and are undergoing treatment. The Arakkonam Taluk police, under whose purview the village falls, have detained four youths belonging to the vanniyar community and hailing from Perumalrajapet and Salaivedal hamlets in connection with murders. Ranipet SP Sivakumar told TOI that the deceased youths and the murder suspects knew each other well and that the clash broke out following a sudden provocation. “Around 20 vanniyar youths rounded up the five dalit youths and attacked them with logs, while a couple of them stabbed Arjunan and Suriya using broken liquor bottles,” he said. The SP, DIG of Vellore range N Kamini and a contingent of police are camping in Soghanur to prevent a caste clash. Arjunan and Suriya died on the way to a hospital, another youth was said to be in a critical condition while the other two injured were stable. Political leaders have condoned the twin murders. VCK functionaries charged that the crime was politically motivated as the attacked youths had campaigned for VCK candidate J Gowthama Sannah in Arakkonam (reserved) constituency. VCK leader Thol Thirumavalavan has announced a state-wide protest on Saturday. “... Caste fanatics committed these murders out of fear of losing the election. VCK demands arrest of PMK caste fanatics & sand mafia gangs. We’ll hold demos on Apr10 at all Dt headquarters,” he tweeted.

---||Delhi||Wrap up by 9pm or face action: Civic officials crack down on weekly mkts||New Delhi: After issuing directions to all weekly markets to wrap up businesses by 9pm, the municipal corporations have started deploying licensing officers to keep a check on defaulters and take immediate action. South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) officials said a meeting was held with the heads of all weekly markets on Thursday morning to clarify that no relaxation in timings would be granted and they should stringently adhere to the Covid norms, including no crowding at one stall, earmarking entry/exit and no encroachment. Since the implementation of movement restrictions from 10pm to 5am, SDMC has issued over 15 challans at weekly markets in two days. “There are 76 weekly markets across south Delhi on different days. Instructions have been issued to the licensing inspectors and the rent collectors to ensure that weekly markets should not also leave their items on roads as per the guidelines,” said an SDMC official. These markets are operating under the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) norms that include maintaining social distancing, wearing masks and use of sanitiser at each stall. The district administration is making available a Covid testing van at every market. “If anyone, including visitors, is taking the situation lightly, they will be prosecuted. Violations include spitting, chewing of tobacco and smoking,” the official added. The mayors of the three municipal corporations also called a meeting to discuss measures/action plan for public areas, markets and weekly bazaars to control the spread of infection and involve market associations to avoid congestion. North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash decided to visit the markets with local police in the late hours, especially Sadar Bazar where major loading-unloading happens at night. Leader of the house Yogesh Verma said the corporation had 110 markets under its jurisdiction. “Representatives of these markets visited us on Wednesday demanding some relaxation in timings for collecting their stuff. But we categorically told them to bring limited items and start packing by 9pm so that everyone should leave the place by 9.30pm,” said Verma. “We can’t give them any liberty considering it’s a DDMA direction and even subdivisional magistrates are taking random rounds with licensing officers.” A market may even be shut down for some time because of an unexpected violation or chaos, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/wrap-up-by-9pm-or-face-action-civic-officials-crack-down-on-weekly-mkts/articleshow/81977370.cms||Vibha Sharma

Housing societies have said many of the small shop owners in the area have 4-5 workers. Societies too have 10-15 workers most in the 18-45 age group. The letter said citizens cannot cover the cost of private RT-PCR tests. Currently, there is one government-run Covid testing centre per ward in PMC.Sarang Wable, from the residents’ association, said, “There is only one government testing centre in the entire area in Bopodi which is far. Secondly, one has to wait for 2-5 hours for the swab test. The results come after two to three days. All we want is for the government to open more testing centres in the area so that the workers can get tested every 15 days without becoming a burden on the business owners or the residents.”Pune’s municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar said mobile testing units in societies will not be possible at this point. “However, if there are companies or industries with 100 or more employees, we have spoken to private laboratories, to set up mobile testing units at such places. We would be releasing an email id where these companies can apply stating their strength and need. These will be paid tests. Rapid antigen test results will also be accepted in place of RT-PCR test reports,” he said.Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil said, “We have a limited capacity for RT-PCR tests every day.

The court said that he has the remedy to make a complaint before the competent magistrate.  “It is not that the aggrieved public servant or the person against whom the said offence is alleged to have been committed has no forum to take his grievances to,” the court said. In his plea the officer had accused Republic TV editor-in-chief Goswami, channel’s director and Goswami’s wife Samyabrata Ray Goswami and ARG Outlier Media Pvt Ltd, owner of Republic Media Network, for the alleged disparaging remarks made against Mumbai Police and him in connection with the probe in actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. The court said that under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) a sessions court could take cognizance of such an offence upon a complaint in writing made by the public prosecutor. “In the present complaint, the complainant is not the public prosecutor. He merely has filed the complaint of Shri Trimukhe... The public prosecutor, thus, is nothing more than a medium to file this complaint. This certainly is not in compliance with what Section 199(2) of the CrPC mandates,” the court said. Trimukhe’s plea had said freedom of speech and expression and freedom of press was not an absolute right and “was clothed with a sense of responsibility which the accused is duly accountable in law when he strays as a habitual offender.” It said the accused have “cunningly hidden behind the “nation wants to know” rhetoric to make their statements and get away from consequences of their wrongdoing.” Trimukhe had been granted sanction for the complaint by the state home department on October 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ips-officer-plea-against-arnab-dismissed/articleshow/81978608.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Mumbai||Youth’s body found in local, ‘robber’ held||Mumbai: A 23-year-old man has been arrested for murder three days after a youth was found dead, with multiple stab wounds, in the luggage compartment of a Panvel-CSMT local. Officials of the railway crime branch, which zeroed in on Asif Shaikh based on CCTV footage from stations, suspect it to be a case of a robbery bid gone wrong, reports Nitasha Natu. “The two did not know each other. It appears they either had a dispute or more likely, the accused tried to rob him,” said a GRP officer. Senior inspector Shailendra Dhiwar of GRP crime branch said, “More likely, the accused tried to rob the victim. Faced with resistance, he could have killed him and fled, after grabbing his phone and identification. Shaikh hasn't spoken so far about what happened.” He added that they are verifying if Shaikh has a crime record.  The police are still trying to establish the victim's identity. The body was found on March 29, when the train reached CSMT around 10.45pm. The victim appeared to be in his twenties and was not carrying any identification or belongings. The railway police at CSMT and the railway crime branch started checking CCTV grabs on all harbour line stations to establish the sequence of events. Footage outside railway limits was also examined.  “The murder victim had boarded the luggage compartment at Kurla station. All travellers, except one, had alighted from the compartment at this station. We deduced that the only other traveller in the compartment was the killer,” said senior inspector Shailendra Dhiwar, GRP crime branch. CCTV grabs at Govandi station showed the accused boarding the luggage compartment with a backpack. Then at GTB Nagar station, the man is seen jumping out of the train from the opposite door with his backpack.  Armed with Shaikh's images from the CCTV grabs, the police combed colonies at Govandi. They received information that Shaikh had been spotted at a transit camp at Wadala Truck Terminus. He was picked up on Thursday and the police are in the process of recovering the murder weapon from him.  BOX: ANOTHER RAILWAY MURDER CASE SOLVED  A 25-year-old man was arrested for the murder of his father-in-law as he was having an affair with his mother-in-law. The corpse was thrown on the railway tracks in the Karjat-Bhivpuri belt in the early hours of March 17 with no identification to make it appear like a railway accident. Police teams travelled to Mumbai, Thane, Palghar, Ahmednagar, Satara, Pune, Amravati and Solapur, following up on leads. Eventually, a family of street dwellers at Thane's Teen Haath Naka identified the victim as Ravi Pawar, 45. Pawar used to live with his wife.  "Pawar's relatives told us they had last seen him on March 16 when Shailesh Bhosle, Pawar's son-in-law, came for a visit. Bhosle took Pawar out for a drink and the two never returned. Relatives suspected Bhosle's involvement," said an officer. Bhosle lived in Ahmednagar. He had taken his mother-in-law to live with him for a while. But she later returned to her husband. "Bhosle had come to Mumbai two days before the murder. He thought eliminating Pawar would force his mother-in-law to be with him permanently," said an officer. Bhosle was tracked down and arrested from Thane on March 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/youths-body-found-in-local-robber-held/articleshow/81865099.cms||Nitasha Natu

The public is barred from all places of worship, which can follow essential rituals with only staff in attendance but will have to shut by 8 pm from April 10. Retail fruit and vegetable shops at the Koyambedu complex here will be also be shut from that date. The government has urged people aged above 45 years to get vaccinated in government hospitals and recognized private hospitals within two weeks. Industries should arrange for vaccination of their employees based on the guidelines issued by the Centre and stern action would be taken for violation of standard operating procedures. Chief secretary Rajeev Ranjan said the public should cooperate for effective containment of the virus. “The management of industries, shopping complexes, private organisations, offices and restaurants should ensure thermal scanning, use of hand sanitisers and wearing of face masks by their employees, officials and the public. Persons without face masks should not be allowed to enter the premises,” he said in an order. The government also set up field-level teams of IAS officers, supported by revenue, police and health officials for each of the 15 zones in Chennai, and engaged monitoring officers for each district, to intensify containment measures. Public and private intra-state buses, including Metropolitan Transport Corporation services in Chennai, would be permitted with the passengers restricted to seating capacity. This applies to buses being operated to Puducherry, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka too. The government said certain restrictions had become imperative given the considerable increase in Covid cases daily and the reason for which was due to non-adherence to Covid-19 protocols, such as wearing of face masks in public places and maintaining social distance.  The active cases that stood at 13,070 on March 28 rose to 30,131 on April 8, following which the health department has begun conducting 80,000 RT-PCR tests a day now and increased and aggressive testing in affected areas. Round-the-clock monitoring will be done in containment zones by teams of officials drawn from police, local bodies and health departments to check the movement of people. Volunteers will be engaged to cater to the essential needs of people in containment zones, besides taking control measures such as spraying disinfectant.  Police, health, revenue and local body staff have been directed to intensify the fever camps, surveillance of people with symptoms of fever, cold and cough daily and contact tracing. The district collectors and commissioner of Greater Chennai Corporation have been directed to enforce the measures strictly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/fresh-curbs-from-tomorrow-in-tn-to-contain-covid-surge/articleshow/81977372.cms||---

On March 31, the number of Covid beds in hospitals was 5,815, but it stood at 10,840 on Friday as per the Delhi Corona mobile application, an increase of 86.4%. The number of ICU beds with ventilators during the same period increased from 787 to 1,157, a rise of 47%. While on March 31, 1,799, or almost 31%, of the 5,815 beds were occupied, on Friday evening, 5,119 (47.2%) of them were occupied as per the mobile app. Out of the 1,157 ICU beds with ventilators, 729 (63%) were in use, while 1,076 (60%) of the 1,777 of ICU beds without ventilators were taken up. During the third and deadliest wave of cases in November 2020, more than 16,000 hospital beds were reserved for Covid treatment. With a decline after December, the number of both ward beds and ICU beds were scaled down to cater to non-Covid patients. On Thursday, Delhi government directed 115 hospitals with 50 beds or more to reserve 50% of their total ICU and ward beds for Covid. As a result, while the number of reserved beds was 8,813 on Thursday, it went up by 2,000 in 24 hours. Four days ago, the state government had increased the availability of Covid beds in 11 of its hospitals by 1,540 and had directed 54 large private hospitals to reserve at least 30% of their ICU beds and ward beds or double the occupancy, whichever was higher. This measure led to Covid beds increasing from around 6,000 to nearly 9,000. The number of active cases on Friday stood at 26,631. However, only 26% of these patients were admitted in hospitals, including in ICU. But with the consistent rise in cases, the beds available for Covid might need to be augmented. The government also directed hospitals to depute sufficient manpower and infrastructure in the holding or triage areas with enough oxygen facility to avoid an unnecessary wait for completing admission procedures and increasing the chances of spreading the coronavirus in such crowded areas. It has instructed doctors belonging to the dental and Ayush cadres to be deployed for Covid duties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/5000-covid-beds-added-in-9-days/articleshow/81995706.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Taking a U-turn on Thursday, office-bearers of Niranjani akhada said that the decision to anoint Rathore has been postponed since he refused to become a sanyasi as per the akhada’s tradition and a householder cannot be anointed as a mahamandaleshwar of the akhada. Earlier, though, it was alleged that mahamandleshwar is just an honorary post and a family man can also be anointed on this post. Sources meanwhile said that the decision was reversed since the seer community had become irked over the decision of the Nairanjani akahada. Akhil Bharatiya Akahada Parishad (ABAP) president and senior seer of Niranjani akhada Mahant Narendra Giri told TOI, “We had decided to anoint BJP MLA Suresh Rathore as mahamandaleshwar of the akhada but he refused to become a Naga sanyasi as per our tradition after which the decision was reversed. There is a clear rule in our tradition that only a sanyasi can hold the post of mahamandaleshwar.” Meanwhile, Rathore who also holds the post of Ravidasacharya of Ravidas sect, said that he is not aware of the decision of the akhada. “I have no idea about the cancellation of the anointment process. There is much enthusiasm among my supporters regarding the anointment and we have already taken out a shobha yatra (procession) in this regard. Some seers may have some misgivings about my anointment but I am sure that these issues will be resolved.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/in-u-turn-niranjani-akhada-says-bjp-mla-not-to-be-anointed-as-mahamandaleshwar/articleshow/81975020.cms||MS Nawaz

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 51 centres may be shut today, vax shortage fear triggers rush||Mumbai: After a rush triggered by fears of vaccine shortage, the city inoculated 56,909 people. Among them was Sunita Ahire, a resident of Gundavali in Andheri. But she had to wait three hours in the scorching sun with hundreds of others to enter the SevenHills Hospital building from the compound. “We watched in the news that the vaccine was getting over, so we rushed here,” she said. But Marol resident Dicky Alphonso (45) had to return without a shot as Holy Spirit Hospital, Andheri, ran out by 1pm. “Many were sent back from Sion hospital due to unavailability of vaccines. This should not happen to old people who are putting themselves at risk by stepping out of their homes in a pandemic,” said Congress corporator Ravi Raja. The BMC released a statement on Thursday, saying it had around 50,000 doses left for Friday. According to a list shared by assistant municipal commissioner for F-North ward Kiran Dighavkar on social media, 51 of 120 centres have cancelled the drive on Friday. Some of the major public centres like the BKC and Dahisar jumbo facilities, SevenHills, Cooper, Kasturba and V N Desai hospitals, have curbed or cancelled. “After the use of about 40,000- 50,000 doses (on Thursday), we are left with an equal number which is barely enough for a day,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer. In Vasai-Virar, only second doses were given and others were turned away. The situation was grim across the state. The state on Wednesday vaccinated 4.37 lakh people, taking the total count of doses administered in the state to 89.55 lakh. The corporation said it had received 17,09,550 doses till April 7. Out of that, 15,61,420 were used and 1,48,130 were left after Wednesday. Of that, 44,810 were Covaxin doses that have to be reserved for second doses. So vaccination opened on Thursday with 1,03,320 doses, which was halved during the day. Among private hospitals, Nanavati in Juhu, Bhatia in Tardeo, Holy Family in Bandra may not hold drives on Friday. Sneha Joseph, executive director of Holy Spirit, said they didn’t get stocks on Thursday, so there was uncertainty over Friday’s drive. Dean of SevenHills Dr Balakrishna Adsul said the crowd had swelled because the vaccines got over around 11am. “It restarted around 12pm after we managed to get 2,750 doses,” he said. Dr Vispi Jokhi, CEO of Masina Hospital, said they have restricted walk-ins so that those who have registered can get it.

Under the revised Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) of Project Tiger, villagers are given two options. Till now Option I included payment of Rs10 lakh per family in case it opts for relocation without the help of the forest department. Under Option II, relocation will be done by the forest department with the same package per family. Now per family package for the same will be Rs15 lakh. In Maharashtra, the villagers proposed to be relocated and owning farmland also used to get four times the cost of farmland as per the ready reckoner rates. The new package will not be applicable to villages already relocated. It is not clear whether it will be applicable to those partially relocated. According to officials, in Maharashtra 110 villages were to be rehabilitated from tiger reserves and sanctuaries. “So far, 66 villages have been relocated,” they said. According to MoEFCC statistics, currently, there are over 41,000 families in 496 villages across the 50 tiger reserves. Around 18,500 families across 215 villages have been relocated till now. The relocation package has been lucrative as per family includes a major (over 18 years) son irrespective of his marital status, unmarried daughter/sister more than 18 years, physically and mentally challenged person irrespective of age and sex, and minor orphan, who has lost both his/her parents and a widow or a woman divorcee. The new national estimate puts the count at 2,967 tigers, a steep jump of 110% over 1,411 recorded in 2006. NTCA officials attributed the voluntary relocation of villages from the tiger reserves as one of the major reasons for the increase in tiger numbers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ntca-hikes-relocation-package-to-rs15-lakh/articleshow/81976093.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Sources in the city cybercrime police said they found that the accused was using a web browser initially designed by the US Navy for secure operations. “Due to this browser, Tor, which keeps the identity of user anonymous, we cannot reach the perpetrator’s IP address because it keep jumping from one country to another,” said a cybercrime officer. He said they are now relying on ISPs to know the gateway the browser was using to narrow down their search because trying to rely on IP addresses will lead to an unending probe. This case has become a prestige issue for the city cybercrime police, who have been investigating for nine months now. A team of 200 hackers and experts from other agencies in the country have been roped in to identify the accused who first threatened to publish obscene pictures of students if an exam was not cancelled, and later even published morphed pictures demanding cancellation of online classes. The accused made the first threat in September 2020, to force the school to postpone exams. Though the school management and parents approached the cops, the accused subsequently emailed more such warnings. The accused had on March 31 joined an online session for Class 12 and shared with the attendees a link to morphed images of students with the latest demand: ‘No online classes till June first week’. Cybercrime cops swung into action and intensified their probe after that incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cybercrime-cops-write-to-all-isps/articleshow/81976098.cms||Ashish Chauhan
---||Hyderabad||SNDP moots Rs 850 crore works to revamp storm water drains||HYDERABAD: Hit hard by the October 2020 flash floods that inundated large swathes across the city, the Strategic Nala Development Plan (SNDP) wing established under the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has prepared detailed proposals worth Rs 858 crore for development and maintenance of storm water drains in the city. The government has established Strategic Nala Development Plan to plan, develop and maintain comprehensive storm water drainage and nala systems, after the devastating floods in October last year. Some of the long-pending issues, such as restoration of Balkapur nala in Khairtabad and construction of a six-lane major bridge on Tank Bund opposite Marriott hotel, are among the civic body’s proposals to the state government. The state government accorded administrative sanction to the project after the GHMC officials submitted zone wise plans and measures to mitigate the damage caused to floods with focus on clearing encroachments on nalas and other structures that obstruct the flow of water and result in flooding. “SNDP had carried out a detailed study of the existing nala and storm water drainage system and has identified critical narrow points, encroachments on nalas, trunk mains and feeder nalas among other issues and submitted a detailed report to take up all the works on a mission mode. These include crucial works in peripheral Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) as well,” the government order read. Meanwhile, in a review meeting with the engineers at the GHMC head office earlier this week, municipal administration and urban development (MAUD) minister K Taraka Rama Rao had directed the civic body officials to remove encroachments and obstructions that have come up along the nalas. “For the displaced homeless families, steps should be taken to allocate double-bedroom houses,” the minister said. The proposed project will be carried out in 15 different packages to expedite the work and complete them at the earliest. The GHMC commissioner shall prioritise the works to be taken up in the first phase and take necessary action accordingly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sndp-moots-rs-850-cr-works-to-revamp-storm-water-drains/articleshow/81976096.cms||---

In his FIR with Sola police, Dr Chirag Shah, a resident of Thaltej who runs a dental clinic near Shreyas Tekra in Ambawadi, said the incident took place on Thursday morning. “I was at home at around 10.30am when I got from call from an unknown person who introduced himself as Inspector Sandip Patil from Nanded in Maharashtra. He told me he wanted to inquire about an accidental death case,” said Shah, in his FIR. As Shah told him to proceed, he told Shah that a pregnant woman who had taken painkillers for a toothache from Shah had died during treatment. The accused told Shah that the woman was also suffering from diabetes and he had given her medications without properly inquiring into her condition. The accused further told him that the woman died due to the side-effects of the medicines and her father had approached cops seeking to file a complaint against Shah. Shah told the accused to let him speak to the deceased’s father, but he told Shah that the father was crying a lot and could not talk with anyone. Then, the accused told Shah that the father would not file a complaint if he transfered Rs 1 lakh to him. Shah said he agreed on humanitarian ground and transferred the money. Later, the accused called him again and said he would have to pay Rs 1.20 lakh more to the cops or he would face legal action. Shah then realized he was being duped and told the accused that he would need time to arrange money. He then called the police control room and filed a complaint of cyber fraud with Sola police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/caller-dupes-dentist-of-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/81976112.cms||---

The remand report says that accused 1-11, who were CPM workers along with other 14 other identifiable persons, arrived as a group and attacked Muhsin and when his brother Mansoor tried to prevent the attack, they attacked him as well. When the two tried to run away, the accused followed them and hurled a bomb with the intention to kill, the report said. The report said the accused had reached the scene after proper planning and committed the attack after identified the targeted person. The police on Thursday recorded the arrest of Shinos, a CPM activist who was taken into custody soon after the attack on Mansoor. He has been remanded for 14 days. The probe into the case has been handed over to Crime Branch. Commissioner of police, Kannur City, R Ilango said a 15-member team headed by district crime branch DSP Ismail has been constituted to investigate into the case. He said the remaining accused had gone into hiding. UDF boycotted an all-party peace meeting convened by Kannur collector to bring about peace in Panoor and nearby areas. IUML and Congress leaders protested over the police’s failure to nab the accused even after their names and addressed have been provided. They hit out at the police for arresting and taking around 24 persons, including Class X student, who participated in the funeral procession of Mansoor in connection with the violence and attack against CPM offices on Wednesday night. "Forty hours have passed after the murder…and police have not been able to nab anyone other than one accused who was detained by Mansoor’s brother, during the attack…We don't have faith in the steps taken by police so far," DCC president Satheesan Pacheni said. IUML state vice president Abdul Khader Moulavi said rather than trying to nab those involved in the murder, the police have been arresting IUML supporters who attended Mansoor’s funeral procession. The police have nabbed around 24 IUML activists in connection with the various violent incidents which took place after Mansoor’s funeral. As many as eight CPM offices had been damaged in the attack. CPM district secretary M V Jayarajan and other leaders visited the party offices which were damaged in the violence.

Directing to keep the lokpal’s orders in abeyance, Justice Tejinder Singh Dhindsa has issued notice to the Punjab government and other respondents, seeking their replies on the contentions that Kaur has raised. The hearing is on August 10. The SGPC president had challenged the lokpal’s orders of January 8, 2021, for a regular inquiry under Section 13 of the Punjab Lokpal Act, 1996, about the complaint filed on August 24, 2011. The complainant wanted to know how a nagar panchayat common land in possession of a school came into the hands of the society that runs the school. Kaur’s counsel argued that under Section 10 of the Punjab Lokpal Act, the lokpal had the powers to look into any allegations only within five years of the misconduct. The petition stated: “The present case doesn’t fall within the scope and ambit of Section 10 (1) for an inquiry to be directed.” The counsel claimed that Kaur had taken a specific stand before the lokpal that the school in question had come up in 1955 and a society managed it. The counsel further stated: “The petitioner married into the village only in 1980 and, thereafter, served as president of the school society at different times. Section 12 (3) of the lokpal Act mandates that any lokpal verdict affecting the rights of the accused has to be a speaking order, while the orders against the petitioner cannot be construed as a speaking order, as her objections were not dealt with.” Based on the contentions, the high court ordered further proceedings in pursuance of the lokpal orders to be held in abeyance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-stays-lokpals-land-grab-probe-against-sgpc-chief/articleshow/81976134.cms||---

According to officials, the Gaddianaram market, the largest fruit market in Telangana, is receiving 400 tonnes of mangoes every day. The quantity is expected to rise to 600 to 700 tonnes in the next few weeks. “We are receiving mangoes from Kolhapur, Nuzvid, Khammam and Rangareddy. Mostly we are getting the Banganpalle variety and are expecting Totapuri, Peddarasalu and Chinnarasalu varieties in the next few days,” said Praveen Reddy, secretary, Gaddianaram market. While the wholesale price for one kg of Banganpalle is about Rs 30-60, the retail price stands at Rs 80-120 per kg.

But now, the quality of mangoes has improved and city is expected to receive better quality mangoes this year,” said Reddy. Apart from mangoes, the city markets are also receiving grapes, watermelons, muskmelons, sweet lime, apple and bananas in abundance.

Most said they are planning to begin with a few and gradually include more corporate offices, depending on resources and demand.  The move follows a directive, issued by the Union health ministry on Wednesday that laid down a series of guidelines for inoculation at workplaces, urging hospitals to flag off the drive on April 11. Medica Superspecialty Hospital plans to begin the vaccination on Monday at two-three corporate sites. “We have finalized an arrangement with HINDALCO, Exide, IOCL and Victoria Memorial to inoculate their employees. There are a hundred companies in our line-up, where we are going to set up camps,” said Medica chairperson, Alok Roy. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS), for instance, plans to begin with two workplaces and employ a team of five from the hospital for the drive. “We will have three support staff, a vaccinator and a doctor in the team. They will travel in a fully-equipped ambulance. We are waiting for the final confirmation from the corporates and have already apprised them of the requirements,” said RTIICS zonal head, R Venkatesh. He added that the hospital may not be able to flag off the drive on Sunday. “But we will begin it within the first two days of the week,” said Venkatesh. Ruby General Hospital has been receiving requests from “several corporates and old-age homes” for off-site centres. But the hospital is planning to wait till April 17 due to an election-induced staff shortage. “A large section of our employees will be voting between April 10 and 17 which could make it difficult for us to manage workplace sites. But we will begin after April 17. Before corporates, we might be visiting the old-age homes,” said Ruby general manager (operations), Subhasish Datta. Charnock Hospital will set up vaccination sites at the offices of Airports Authority of India, ESI, FCI, ONGC, NTPC and others. “There are more on the list and we will begin next week,” said Charnock managing director, Prashant Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/private-facilities-plan-to-start-office-vaccination-next-week/articleshow/81976156.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

They said the state should at least pay them Rs 5,000 per month until schools physically reopen or give them Rs 2,000 per month for the last 10 months. “We are glad that the CM reacted on our issue, but the help announced is too little. We were demanding Rs 10,000 per month, the state should at least give us Rs 5,000,” said Shabir Ali, president, Telangana Private Teachers Forum.  The teachers said that instead of giving them Rs 2,000, the state should talk to managements and ensure that they get at least 50% of their salary dues. “Even if we assume that a teacher is being paid Rs 10,000 per month, we will get Rs 60, 000 if 50% of the salary is paid.

With mercury rising in the city, the locals have demanded the civic officials to look into the matter and get the machines fixed at the earliest possible. However, Prerna Dhyani, PRO, Dehradun Smart City, told TOI, “Due to rising Covid-19 cases, the operator is not sitting at the water ATMs inside the Doon Hospital. It’s working in auto mode and people can deposit coins to get water. At Gandhi Park too, people can deposit coins to get water.” To this, locals have said that a lot of commuters return after not finding an operator inside the booth. They add that the officials must put up a board stating that the machines are working. Vineet Rawat, a local, said “How are we supposed to know that we can get water by putting in a coin? Earlier, the operator used to give the water.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/water-atms-in-doon-lying-dysfunctional-for-months/articleshow/81975035.cms||Abhijeet Singh
---||Ahmedabad||Q4 car sales in Gujarat up by 16%||AHMEDABAD: The year 2021 seems to be better than last year, at least for car dealers in the state. Car sales have registered a 16% jump this year in January-March (Q4) as compared to sales in the same period of 2019. Registration data of the transport department reveals that 83,000 cars were sold in the first three months of 2021, which is higher than the 71,000 cars sold in the same period in 2020, or even the 74,000 sold in Jan-March 2019. The data also reveals that from April 2020 to March 2021 car sales dropped by only 5.8% against the previous year’s sales, while two-wheeler sales dropped by 39%. In March 2021, 25,000 cars were registered as against 19,000 registered in 2019. In March, the vehicle registration recorded an increase of 31.6%. The sales of two-wheelers in March 2021 registered a decline of 43% against last year’s. In March 2021, 67,000 two-wheelers were sold as against 1.18 lakh in 2020. Pranav Shah, chairman, Gujarat region, Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (FADA) said, “There are many reasons for the growth in car sales, but the main reason is that people are keen on using private vehicles and avoid public transport. “I also feel that the income of middle and upper-middle income group has not been affected much, or at least it has not kept them away from buying cars. “Also, we have realized that the loan rejection rate for a four-wheeler was not as high as that for a two wheeler and hence availability of finance at lower rate of interest has also brought people to buy more cars than two-wheelers.” Amit Khatri, a traffic expert said, “The new mantra is that fear of health is forcing people to buy four-wheelers. The demand was high from Tier II and Tier III towns as they had the cash, and to keep away from public transport they have utilized their resources. People prefer the enclosed and relative isolation of a four-wheeler as against two-wheelers.” There is, however, a pronounced negative sentiment among two -wheeler buyers which continued in this financial year, and the drop in sales compared to the last financial year ranged from 30% to 60% across various districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/q4-car-sales-in-gujarat-up-by-16/articleshow/81976203.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

The 65-year-old doctor, who heads the state’s nodal hospital for Covid care, said she is ready to take up all responsibilities even as the hospital beds are being filled up fast by positive patients. “I am still on medication but that’s alright. I am thankful to doctors and other support staff at SSKM Hospital, who took care of me, so that I could be back on my feet. Senior health officials at Swasthya Bhawan, too, ensured that I got proper care,” Haldar said. She was at Midnapore Medical College as an external examiner for the final MBBS examination when TOI caught up with her. “Beds in our hospital are filling up fast with Covid-positive patients. This is going to be the beginning of another tough phase. But we will put in our best efforts come what may,” said Haldar, who did not take a single day off during the first wave. To encourage healthcare workers Haldar took the vaccine on January 16, the first day of the rollout. Even as she faced no issues after the first dose, she fell seriously ill after getting the second dose of the vaccine. She was hospitalised for about 12 days in February at SSKM Hospital with complaints, including acute myositis (muscle pain in the lower limb) and vomiting. She had to be re-admitted again in the hospital between March 7 and 17. “The vaccine could have been a coincident. Now the pain and cramp in muscle are easing away slowly. So, I should have no problem going back to work full-fledged,” said Haldar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/key-cov-facility-head-back-at-work-after-bout-of-illness-post-second-jab/articleshow/81976224.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Chandigarh||SAD (D) in talks with like-minded parties, no leader joining AAP: Parminder||Chandigarh: Shiromani Akali Dal (Democratic) leader Parminder Singh Dhindsa said on Thursday though his party is in talks with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and other like-minded parties — other than the Congress, SAD (B) and the BJP — to come up with a fourth political front in Punjab, none of his party leaders was joining AAP. Asked about the claim of AAP leader and leader of opposition in Punjab assembly, Harpal Singh Cheema that SAD (D) leaders are going to join his party soon, Dhindsa told TOI, “None of the leaders from our party is joining the AAP. His claim is wrong.” The former finance minister and Lehra MLA, however, said he had recently met two senior leaders of the AAP, including AAP co-incharge in Punjab Raghav Chadha, in Chandigarh, for initial deliberations on the issue and the talks were moving in a positive direction. All possibilities were discussed in the meeting but both the parties are yet to reach any final decision, he clarified. Since SAD (D) is looking for an alliance with other political parties like the AAP, Bahujan Samaj Party and Lok Insaaf Party, Dhindsa is of the view that in case talks mature, AAP may lead since it is a big party. He also said there is no fight for the chief minister’s face in the state assembly elections scheduled early next year and that he is not running after the chief minister’s post in the larger interest of Punjab. The SAD (D) leader further added that his party will also try to bring together all the like-minded people who want to see Punjab prosper, including Bholath MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira and former MP of AAP from Patiala Dharamvira Gandhi. The former finance minister said their doors are also open for the former cabinet minister and Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-d-in-talks-with-like-minded-parties-no-leader-joining-aap-parminder/articleshow/81976207.cms||---

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Companies breathe easy as antigen tests an option for on-site staffers||PUNE: The municipal commissioners of Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, as well as the district collector, on Thursday allowed the use of rapid antigen tests for on-site employees of exempt industries. Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar and his Pimpri Chinchwad counterpart Rajesh Patil said this during a meeting with industrial representatives on Thursday, held to discuss the logistics of holding vaccination drives on factory premises. Collector Rajesh Deshmukh confirmed the development to TOI over the phone. Other norms, such as testing workers every 15 days, remain the same, but Thursday’s decision comes as a massive relief to industries — especially micro, small and medium enterprises — which were worried about the high cost of conducting regular RT-PCR tests. “Industries would be allowed to use rapid antigen or RT-PCR tests. We made this decision after holding discussions with officials, including the chief secretary,” PCMC chief Patil said. Meanwhile, Patil and Kumar they have set up dedicated teams to field requests from companies that have offered their facilities for vaccination drives. Nodal officers would review the preparedness of each premises. “We would prefer premises that can accommodate at least 100 vaccinations per day,” PMC commissioner Kumar said. “There are some requirements under the standard operating procedure — separate rooms for waiting, vaccination and observation, and computer support for to enter and record date. We would also require staff to manage beneficiaries. If some companies have fewer than 100 employees, they can team up with nearby units and set up a vaccination facility,” he added. District authorities said they have already received several requests and expressed confidence about a smooth rollout, despite reports of vaccine shortage. “So far, 17 companies have expressed an interest in holding vaccination drives on their premises. They have existing medical facilities and tie-ups with hospitals. We hope to roll out vaccination at the workplace smoothly, and we are getting new stock of vaccines every three or four days,” Pune ZP CEO Ayush Prasad said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/companies-breathe-easy-as-antigen-tests-an-option-for-on-site-staffers/articleshow/81977464.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

Vehicle registrations in Gujarat in the financial year 2020-21 declined by 36% overall compared to 2019-20. The number of vehicles registered in the state from April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021 was 10.52 lakh as compared to 16.44 lakh in 2019-20. The data shows that districts with municipal corporations registered declines over 37%. The biggest decline was in Surat which saw a 45% decline followed by Ahmedabad, where registrations fell by 42%. In sharp contrast, at least 10 districts, mostly dependent on agriculture, recorded increases in four wheeler registrations ranging from 1% to 10%. The rural population, with a good monsoon this year, also invested heavily in tractors and harvesters and this was to tide over the labour crisis which was due to the exodus of workers to their homes following the Covid outbreak in March. The officials said that the districts of Bhavnagar, Devbhoomi Dwarka, Banaskantha, Amreli, Patan, Tapi, Surendranagar, Narmada, Chotta Udepur, Dahod, Ahwa, Veraval among others saw an increase in four-wheeler registrations this financial year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vehicle-sales-fall-by-36-overall/articleshow/81976225.cms||---

Chief minister Pramod Sawant had last year announced a Rs 50 lakh insurance cover and a 20% wage hike for healthcare workers. “However, till date, neither have been fulfilled,” AAP’s Goa convenor Rahul Mhambre said. Goa is now facing the second wave and the government is ill-equipped to deal with it as it is following the same procedures it undertook earlier, without realising that the second wave needs to be dealt with differently, Mhambre said. AAP government in Delhi came out with a good model to deal with Covid, which has been hailed and adopted by some other states, he said, adding that it is unfortunate that Goa did not take a leaf from Delhi even though a painstakingly prepared white paper was presented to the Goa government. He said the state government would do well to implement the recommendations in the white paper and at least adopt the five-point strategy of home isolation, reducing death count, ambulance management and involving all stakeholders. “It is time for Sawant to take the second wave seriously and ensure the safety of the Goan population,” Mhambre said. The 5-T formula which includes testing, tracing, treatment, tracking and teamwork, that gave excellent results in Delhi, must be adopted in Goa, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-govt-yet-to-meet-wage-hike-for-healthcare-workers/articleshow/81977458.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Why this discrimination against Maharashtra? Tope||MUMBAI: A day after Union health minister Harsh Vardhan hit out at some states, especially Maharashtra, over vaccine shortage, state public health minister Rajesh Tope questioned the Centre’s discrimination against Maharashtra by allotting it fewer vaccine doses compared to other states. Tope said that on Wednesday, the Centre had allotted only 7.4 lakh additional doses for the state though it is leading in the vaccination drive in a bid to control the second wave. After speaking with Harsh Vardhan on Thursday, it was revised to 17.4 lakh doses. “Maharashtra has been allotted 17.4 lakh doses, while UP will get 48 lakh, 40 lakh will go to MP, 30 lakh to Gujarat and 24 lakh to Harayana. Why is there discrimination against Maharashtra?” asked Tope. “Gujarat, which has a population of six crore, and Maharashtra, which has a population of 12 crore and also the highest caseload, deaths and contributes to 54% of active cases in the country, have been given almost the same amount of doses. Gujarat has received a total of 1 crore doses, while Maharashtra has received 1.04 crore doses so far… With Maharashtra being worst-hit due to the second wave, there is a need to give vaccine to the state on priority,” he added. As on Thursday morning, the state had about 9 lakh doses left which would last less than two days. “There are many districts like Satara, Sangli, Buldhana, Gondia, where shots have been halted due to shortage. There is very little stock left with Mumbai and Pune as well. We are repeatedly demanding 40 lakh doses per week to keep up the pace of our vaccination drive,” said Tope. “Though health is a state subject, the Centre has kept all the decisions regarding vaccination with them. They should devise a method of replenishing stocks at regular intervals so that a ‘hand to mouth’ situation does not arise,” said Tope, adding that Maharashtra is a “very cultured state” and does not want to create any controversy. He rejected the Centre’s claims that Maharashtra has failed to handle the Covid crisis properly. The state has followed all the guidelines issued by ICMR and the Centre in totality. “Our administration and health machinery have been working round the clock. We have been sincere and transparent about reporting all the data to the Centre. I cannot say the same about other states,” said Tope.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/why-this-discrimination-against-maharashtra-tope/articleshow/81977485.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Kolkata||After hacking down trees, Lake eatery sets up concrete tables||Kolkata: Green activists visited Rabindra Sarobar on Thursday to find that the owners of the eatery, who had hacked two or three full-grown palm trees on Monday for the beautification of its open-air seating arrangement, have done more damage to the ambience. On being alerted by some morning walkers, representatives of the NGO, Public, visited the spot and found that concrete tables have been built there. Chopping off the trees was actually a part of their plan to create a bigger setup by occupying more space inside the eco-sensitive zone, which is included in the National Lake Conservation Plan (NLCP). Bonani Kakkar, founder president, Public, said, “Much to our dismay, we found that the assault to the otherwise pristine area has been greater than we imagined.” Even as KMDA, the custodian of the 192-acre lungs of south Kolkata, has sealed off the eatery after morning walkers had lodged a complaint with the police against the tree-felling, Kakkar’s team couldn’t find any security guard at the spot. “The place must be restored. It’s been three days but KMDA has just left things as they were,” said Kakkar. The NGO wrote to P Ulganathan, CEO, KMDA: “We visited the site today and found even more reasons to be concerned. The ‘ex-Army’ shop that was reported to have been responsible for the hacking of trees also seems to be setting up some temporary shacks and a few concrete tables for their business.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-hacking-down-trees-lake-eatery-sets-up-concrete-tables/articleshow/81976238.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

The hospital’s occupancy continues to be at around 75%. More than a dozen patients from GMC’s Covid wards have been transferred to the South Goa district hospital over the past few days. Recently, the hospital has been seeing more than 30 admissions on some days. Only one bed in the nine-bedded ICU, which is reserved for patients with kidney failure, is vacant. The hospital has readied a nine-bedded intensive treatment unit (ITU) complete with high flow oxygen and ventilators, which will act as a step down from the ICU. This is located next to the ICU, on the same floor as the hospital’s Covid wards, but is awaiting manpower. “The hospital’s ITU will be started when doctors from GMC and DHS are sent there,” a health official said. While all the Covid patients are being accommodated on the third floor of the hospital, preparations are on to open up another floor and scale up by another 150 beds. “The floor with 150 beds is ready with medicines and all infrastructure in place. As soon as we send doctors, nurses, ward boys and patient handlers to the hospital, it will commence functioning,” the health official said. TOI has been reporting that a spike in coronavirus cases has led to a significant rise in hospitalisation over the past few weeks. The new ward is expected to decrease the load on GMC. Health minister Vishwajit Rane had said on Tuesday that ten patients were on trolleys at GMC for want of beds in Covid wards. The state’s premier hospital treats the state’s most critical Covid patients, especially those who require super speciality care, besides other Covid patients. Rane on Tuesday said that the government has proposed to add 300 more beds to the South Goa district hospital within a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/south-district-hosp-icu-full-for-12th-consecutive-day/articleshow/81977469.cms||Lisa Monteiro

---||Nagpur||New species added to bird list of India from Arunachal||NAGPUR: A team of scientists from Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), Mumbai, while exploring the high-altitude coniferous forests of Arunachal Pradesh, has recorded a rare species of bird which has been identified as the Three-banded Rosefinch after detailed observations. According to assistant director of BNHS, Girish Jathar, this species is a resident of Southern China and vagrant in Bhutan. Thus, this is the first confirmed report of Three-banded Rosefinch from Arunachal Pradesh, a new addition to the list of birds from India. The bird was recorded on February 8, 2021, but the team some took time for confirmation. “We recently published this finding in the journal Indian Birds. Our team is conducting intensive surveys of finches across the Eastern Himalayas as a part of an ongoing study funded by Oracle,” said Jathar. Jathar further said that during one of these surveys, BNHS researchers Atharva Singh and Himadri Shekar Mondal first photographed a male and a female individual of this species at Sela Pass, Arunachal Pradesh, at an altitude of 3,852 metre above the sea level. “This pair was seen with a flock of White-browed Rosefinch, a species commonly seen in this landscape,” he said. The species belongs to the family of finch, Fringillidae, which are seed-eating passerine birds with a distinctively conical bill. Singh, lead author of the published work, states that the Three-banded Rosefinch may be using the high altitude temperate coniferous forest of Arunachal Pradesh as a passage while migrating from China to Bhutan. “Thus, this landscape is a potential corridor for this species. Little information is available on the ecology of this species,” said Mondal, who is the second author of this paper. Jathar, who is leading the Climate Change and Himalaya Program at BNHS, mentions that the altitudinal record of this species sighting from India is higher than its previous known altitudinal records from China. Hence, it opens up interesting ecological research on the species in the future. So far 1,340 bird species have been reported from India and with the advent of technology and enthusiast birders reaching remote areas of the country, several species are being reported each year. “Since 2016, the bird checklist of India has increased by 104 new species which were not reported previously. In 2021, five new species including Three-banded Rosefinch have been added. In 2020, there were three new additions to the checklist,” said Jathar. This new addition of birds for India by scientists from the BNHS highlights the importance of intensive surveys in the least studied landscapes like the Eastern Himalayas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/new-species-added-to-bird-list-of-india-from-arunachal/articleshow/81974310.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

There’s much resentment among people over the Centenary Memorial Park coming up 7-odd kilometers from the national memorial. To earn their sympathy, the administration collected long-preserved blood-soaked soil from the families of the martyrs to keep over there. However, one of the project contractors told TOI that the martyrs’ well had been “given a new look for a better view”, with statues that give an impression of a crowd’s coming to the Baisakhi festival 102 years ago. About the exact count of those martyrs from an undivided India, Pakistan’s Bhagat Singh Memorial Foundation chairman Imtiaz Rashid Qureshi said: “I have begun efforts to know.” Alleging an attempt to overshadow the massacre’s actual site, Jallianwala Bagh Shaheed Parivar Samiti president Mahash Behal said, “There was no need of a centenary memorial. It was a government’s decision and not of the people of Amritsar or the families of the martyrs. The Samiti will approach the government to get the martyrs’ count. Different records put the number between 1,000 and 1,500 but the process to know the fact should begin this April 13.” The samiti resented not being taken into confidence for the renovation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/test-of-history-before-all-new-jallianwala-bagh/articleshow/81976239.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Delhi||DDMA ponders over more preventive steps||New Delhi: Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Friday discussed various measures to check the surge in Covid-19 cases, including imposing restrictions on movement, curbs on weekly markets, capping the number of passengers in public transport buses, restricting gatherings, staggering office timings, among other measures. However, no final decisions were announced. Currently, movement is restricted in the city between 10pm and 5am till April 30. A source said there was no possibility of an immediate lockdown because the members agreed that it was not feasible and it would hit the economy hard and may also trigger another exodus of migrant workers. DDMA also discussed the ways other states were adopting to check the virus spread. Some more restrictions may be announced soon if the situation continues to worsen. The meeting was chaired by LG Anil Baijal and attended by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, deputy CM Manish Sisodia, revenue minister Kailash Gahlot, health minister Satyendar Jain, Delhi chief secretary, AIIMS director Randeep Guleria, and other officials. “After detailed deliberations with experts, strict enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour was emphasised, particularly in marketplaces, public transport, workplaces, etc, especially in the wake of the upcoming festivals,” the LG tweeted. Stress was put on enhancing the capacity of both government and private hospitals. “Besides ensuring enhanced capacity and dedicated resources in hospitals for treatment of Covid-19 patients, the district administrations were directed to ensure optimum utilisation of existing Covid Care Centres,” Baijal further tweeted. The health department was asked to ensure ramping up of medical infrastructure and preparedness to the November 2020 levels and reinforcing systems for case fatality management, etc. DDMA also directed the authorities to be more vigilant and ensure strict enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour at marketplaces, malls, hospitals, restaurants, public gatherings, public transport and offices. The authorities were also advised to go for extensive information, education and communication activities, engagement of community leaders and residents’ welfare associations for creating awareness among people for self-regulation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ddma-ponders-over-more-preventive-steps/articleshow/81995806.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||India||India’s doing all that’s needed for net-zero emission: Kerry||NEW DELHI: Putting at rest intense speculation that US special envoy John Kerry was in India to pressure the Indian government to make a ‘net-zero’ pledge, Kerry on Thursday said it was not his message to the government and India was doing all that is needed to reach such an outcome. “That was not my message with the Prime Minister. He understands the challenge. It would be great if India wanted to say that but I don’t think it’s an absolute requirement. India is doing all the things it needs to do to get us there (to ‘net-zero’). India has a plan right now for 450 GW. If 450 GW of renewable power is put into place, India would be one of the few nations helping to keep 1.5 degrees alive,” he said. Questioned about his remarks that he was putting to gether a consortium to finance India’s renewable energy ambitions, Kerry said Modi’s goal of getting 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030, was “terrific, powerful”. “We want to make sure we can help reach that goal — that’s part of our partnership.” Speaking with a group of journalists, he added, “What is more important than making a pledge is real actions now from 2020-2030. Our challenge over the next few months is to get more people engaged in the 2020-2030 decade. That’s what President Biden is trying to do with the summit he’s hosting, where he’s asking nations to up their ambition.” He said there are lots of countries which would be willing to invest in India’s green energy ambitions “if there are right investment conditions”. He said, “The agreement at our discussion yesterday (is that) we intend to work very closely with India, focusing on technology and financ ing.” UAE, he said, is one of the countries with whom India is already working and which is interested in doing more. “I’ve also talked to other countries — some in Europe, some in our continent who are prepared to come forward.” “We need to work through some of the details with the Modi government. We’ve already started that and will continue through the next few weeks. The clock is ticking on Glasgow (COP 26) and 2030,” the envoy said. Meanwhile, giving an official readout of Kerry’s visit, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said, “Given our complementary strengths, the Prime Minister and special envoy Kerry agreed to collaborate on a 2030 Agenda, with focus on clean and green energy through enhancing the availability of climate finance, building resilient infrastructure, energy storage and green hydrogen.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indias-doing-all-thats-needed-for-net-zero-emission-kerry/articleshow/81979156.cms||Indrani Bagchi
---||Kolkata||Buses go off road for election duty, commuters left in lurch||Kolkata: With the  Commission requisitioning 70 per cent of city buses to ferry security forces and polling personnel for the fourth phase of Assembly elections in the state, daily commuters are facing a major crisis. A majority of passengers are now dependent on autos for their daily commute to workplace, resulting in a sharp rise in conveyance cost for most. Old scenes of long queues for buses have returned at nearly all bus stops with demand far exceeding the supply. Some buses were found to be over-crowded during the morning and evening peak hours. EC started requisitioning a large number of buses in the city since early last week. By the beginning of this week, 50% of buses were taken off the road. “I had great difficulty in getting buses to reach my office. It is worse at the end of the day when we are homebound,” said Amiya Patra, a private company employee from Behala who travels to his Garia office by bus, but is now availing of autos. Patra is now spending four times what he used to spend for his daily bus trip. “We are in a strange trouble; our salary has decreased, yet travel cost has increased,” he added. Bengal in earlier elections did not see this scale of deployment of central armed forces (CAFs) across the state to ensure a peaceful election. Since the poll dates are extremely stretched out, CAF needs to move from one place to another. On Wednesday, a day before the campaign ended, EC took away more buses for ferrying polling officials. “We now have 10 to 15% buses left to sustain the office commuting. Fortunately, schools are closed,” said Tapan Banerjee of joint Council of Bus Syndicates. Only the entire fleet of e-buses were spared as most of the places don't have charging facilities. EC has revised the hiring charges of the buses. This has led bus operators to voluntarily offer their vehicles to get requisitioned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/buses-go-off-road-for-election-duty-commuters-left-in-lurch/articleshow/81976251.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Mumbai||No. of commuters on WR, CR locals drops by 6 lakh per day in Mumbai||MUMBAI: The lockdown has led to a fall in the number of passengers by at least 6 lakh across the suburban network on Western Railway (WR) and Central Railway (CR) as offices are not working at an optimum capacity. Suburban train services resumed for general category passengers from February 1. CR’s chief public relations officer Shivaji Sutar said, “After March 8, the number of passengers per day had touched around 22 lakh. However since the lockdown, the figures is estimated to be around Rs 19 lakh.” A WR official said, “On WR, the number of passengers has decreased from nearly 17.5 lakh to 14.5 lakh per day.” WR and CR, used to carry around 35 lakh and 45 lakh passengers respectively per day prior to the lockdown. The number of passengers has been dwindling even before the second lockdown was announced. Kurla resident Pankesh Damania who works for a cash operations firm at CBD Belapur said, “We have been asked to not come to office due to the rise in cases in past weeks.” Borivli resident Aswhini Sarode who works for a logistics company said, “Before lockdown we had been asked to come to office on alternate days. But after the fresh notification, everyone has been asked to work from home.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-of-commuters-on-wr-cr-locals-drops-by-6-lakh-per-day-in-mumbai/articleshow/81977544.cms||Manthank Mehta

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: As MVA & BJP spar over vaccine supply, Sharad Pawar says Centre helping||MUMBAI: Even as Congress and NCP in Maharashtra on Thursday hit out at Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan for his criticism of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government on the vaccine availability row and state health minister Rajesh Tope accused the Centre of “discrimination,” NCP president Sharad Pawar created a flutter by saying the Centre had assured it would help Maharashtra. Pawar, seeming to diverge from the MVA’s stand against the Centre, said Harsh Vardhan had assured him the Centre would stand by the Maharashtra government and all other states to tackle the situation. “The Centre is also helping. I spoke to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan yesterday regarding the situation in Maharashtra,” the NCP chief said in a live address on Facebook. BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis, on the other hand, accused the MVA government of playing politics over vaccine shortage to divert attention away from its own failures. Fadnavis said the Union government has taken all states on board. He said NCP Sharad Pawar had spoken to the Union health minister, who had assured him of all assistance. Fadnavis said vaccination centres were being deliberately shut and vaccination politics was being played to divert people’s attention. He said 15 lakh vials were still left with the state. Union minister Prakash Javadekar however claimed the state still had 23 lakh doses and 7 lakh were on the way. Javadekar alleged the MVA government had wasted 5 lakh doses. On Wednesday, Vardhan had lashed out at Maharashtra and some other states, accusing them of trying to cover their “failures” by making “irresponsible” statements to distract attention. Former Union minister P Chidambaram, elected to Rajya Sabha from Maharashtra, said the Centre was targeting Maharashtra and ignoring hard facts. “Maharashtra has vaccinated 80% of healthcare workers, nearly 20 states are behind Maharashtra in vaccinating senior citizens,” he said. He added, “Maharashtra stands fifth in the country. These facts are from Harsh Vardhan’s statement. Vardhan should stand before a mirror and ask the question if the Centre has supplied enough vaccines to Maharashtra.” State Congress chief Nana Patole, state NCP presidentJayant Patil and medical education minister Amit Deshmukh criticised Vardhan and blamed Modi government for not providing adequate supply of vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-as-mva-bjp-spar-over-vaccine-supply-pawar-says-centre-helping/articleshow/81977518.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||SAD requests world-class museum to commemorate Guru Teg Bahadur’s life||Chandigarh: The SAD on Thursday raised the demand to establish a world class museum in Delhi to showcase the life and sacrifice of Guru Teg Bahadur on the occasion of his 400th birth anniversary. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal also urged for withdrawing all cases against farmers as well as youth which had been registered after the Republic Day violence “in the spirit of sarbat da bhala”. Participating in a meeting of a high-level committee presided over by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which was held on Thursday to finalise the year-long events to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the Guru, the Ferozepur MP said the proposed museum should be on the lines of the Virasat-e-Khalsa at Anandpur Sahib. “This is the need of the hour to make the new generation aware of the sacrifice of Guru Tegh Bahadur as well as those of his followers,” he added. The SAD president also urged that the birth anniversary of the Guru on May 1 should be observed as ‘National Integration Day’ and his life and sacrifice as well as that of the other Gurus should be included in the school curriculum. He also requested that the three holy towns of Amritsar, Baba Bakala and Anandpur Sahib should be developed appropriately. Though the erstwhile SAD-led government had done its bit to develop Amritsar, more could be done by the central government, he added. Sukhbir also requested the Prime Minister to take appropriate steps to reopen the Kartarpur Sahib corridor so that Sikh pilgrims could pay their obeisance at the last resting place of Guru Nanak Dev. He said the PM could take up the issue with the Pakistan government. The SAD president also called for the release of all Sikh detainees who were still incarcerated in jails even after completion of their jail sentences. He said doing so would send a right message on the occasion of the 400th anniversary of the Guru. He requested that SGPC be made the nodal agency for organising the year-long celebrations stating this would ensure that the Sikh maryada was observed appropriately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-requests-world-class-museum-to-commemorate-guru-teg-bahadurs-life/articleshow/81976247.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Former NCM vice-chairman condemns SGPC resolution against RSS||Jalandhar: Condemning the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee resolution against the RSS for its alleged bid to make India a “Hindu rashtra” and suppression of freedom of other religions, senior BJP leader and National Commission for Minorities (NCM) former vice-chairman Manjit Singh Rai alleged that the resolution had been passed due to political reasons at the behest of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president. “Everybody knows who appoints SGPC president and who sends the name of the appointee in an envelope. It is politics of the Shiromani Akali Dal to defame RSS for political purposes. It is not difficult to know who is behind the scene,” Rai said while addressing a press conference here on Thursday. Although he did not name SAD president Sukhbir Badal, he gave ample indications about who he meant. “It is misuse of a religious institution for political purposes. The resolution has been passed only due to political reasons even as they clearly know how RSS has always vouched and worked for Hindu-Sikh unity and has always promoted respect for Sikhism,” he said. Quoting from two books, he claimed that these were swayamsevaks (RSS volunteers) who protected Darbar Sahib twice – first on March 6 and then on March 9, 1947 – from Muslim mobs trying to attack the central Sikh shrine. “RSS has always promoted great respect for Sikh gurus and Sikhism. Even during the November 1984 anti-Sikh violence, RSS and BJP people protected the Sikhs,” he said. Rai’s contention was endorsed by Rashtariya Sikh Sangat district Jalandhar unit general secretary M P Singh, who accompanied him in the press conference, said his family was protected during the November 1984 violence at Kalanaur town of Rohtak by RSS members who stood guard outside the street for three days to turn the rioters away. “Job of the SGPC is to promote Sikhism but they have been failing in their primary task. Scores of Sikhs have converted to Christianity in border areas of Punjab but SGPC has turned a blind eye towards such a crucial issue. They should focus on spreading Sikhism in place of indulging in politics. Working of SGPC is full of deficiencies but in place of introspection they have passed a resolution against the RSS only due to political reasons which is condemnable,” Rai alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/former-ncm-vice-chairman-condemns-sgpc-resolution-against-rss/articleshow/81976253.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||KLF narco-terror: NIA adds charges||MOHALI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) filed a supplementary chargesheet against three accused in Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF) narco-terror case in the NIA special court in Mohali on Thursday. According to NIA official statement, additional charges have been filed against Rajinder Singh alias Ganja of Amritsar, Parminder Pal Singh alias Bobby, and Jasmeet Singh Hakimzada, a Dubai-based international drugs smuggler and money launderer originally from New Delhi. All three have been charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, it added. It said investigations revealed that Rajinder used to smuggle heroin to India while Parminder played a crucial role in channelising the proceeds through hawala from India to Dubai. Hakimzada used to further transfer the funds to entities based in Pakistan, which funded banned terrorist organisation KLF for terror activities. The chargesheet states: “Hakimzada and Harmeet Singh, a Pakistan-based self-styled chief of KLF, have been instrumental in running a narco-terror network to strengthen the terrorist activities of the banned outfit. The investigation also established that a network of narco-traffickers, terrorists and hawala operatives based in Punjab, Delhi and Dubai was operating at the behest of Harmeet Singh and Hakimzada and indulging in subversive activities against India.’ The case emerged from a Punjab Police FIR following a seizure of 500g of heroin and drug proceeds of about Rs 1,20,000 on May 31, 2020, from Jajbir Singh Samra and two other accused persons. The NIA took over the case later and after completion of investigation, filed a charge sheet against 10 accused persons in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/nia-files-supplementary-chargesheet-in-klf-narco-terror-case/articleshow/81976286.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

Kannur DCC president Satheesan Pacheni, in the complaint filed to chief electoral officer Teeka Ram Meena, has stated that the remarks made by the chief minister was a clear violation of the Part 1 (General Conduct), Clause 3 of election model code of conduct, which says that “there shall be no appeal to caste or communal feelings for securing votes”. Pacheni has urged the EC to take cognizance of the violation and appropriate action in this regard. He has also submitted a USB drive containing the visuals of the election day media interaction of the chief minister after casting his vote at R C Amala Basic UP School at Pinarayi. “It is a serious violation of the election model code of conduct as the chief minister himself has taken the initiative to mislead the people by exploiting their religious feelings,” Pacheni said. Responding to the media question on the remarks of NSS general secretary G Sukumaran Nair that believers’ still harboured resentment against the LDF government, Vijayan had said that gods stood with the state government as it has protected the people of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cong-files-plaint-with-ec-against-pinarayi/articleshow/81975115.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The US, too, said it is increasingly concerned about what it sees as escalating Russian aggression and was discussing the issue with its Nato allies.  “Russia now has more troops on the border with Ukraine than at any time since 2014,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in Washington, referring to the period when Russia annexed the Crimea region of Ukraine. Officials in Ukraine and the West have raised concerns about increasingly frequent ceasefire violations in the country’s industrial heartland, known as Donbas.  Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited the area of conflict on Thursday and accused Russia of flexing its military muscles. In Moscow, a senior Kremlin official sternly warned Ukraine against using force to reclaim control of the rebel east, saying that this might force Russia to step in to protect civilians there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/germany-us-concerned-over-russian-troops-near-ukraine/articleshow/81979381.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Surge tests capacity, labs say can’t scale up further||NEW DELHI: The RT-PCR testing capacity in the city seems to have hit its maximum potential. Around 85,000 tests have been conducted daily over the past eight days. Of these, nearly 51,000 (60%) have been RT-PCR and the rest Rapid Antigen Tests, data shared by Delhi government shows. RT-PCR detects infection by targeting specific genetic sequences of SARS CoV2. It has 68-80% sensitivity (ability to correctly identify the disease). RAT, however, targets specific viral proteins present in the samples. Though RAT gives results faster, the test’s sensitivity is significantly lower, which means it has a high rate of false negative results. Therefore, RT-PCR testing is preferred. While RT-PCR is available free of cost in government hospitals, private labs charge Rs 800 for it. For home collection of samples, Rs 400 is charged by private labs. In the last two weeks, since Covid-19 cases started to rise exponentially, there have been multiple complaints of private labs refusing to collect the samples from home. The labs said this was because they were overburdened. “We are conducting close to 4,000 tests daily. To do more tests, we might have to buy machines, hire more manpower and create space. All this costs money and requires time. We are short of both,” said the owner of a private lab chain. Dr Naveen Dang, founder of Dr Dang’s Lab, said they had increased testing capacity by over three times in the last six months. “To increase it further, we will have to buy equipment and hire more trained manpower. This needs time,” he added. Dr Arvind Lal, chairman and managing director of Dr Lal Path Labs, said the government should hold a meeting of all stakeholders to find a solution to the emerging crisis. Founder-director of Genestrings Diagnostic Centre, Dr Gauri Agarwal, said they were conducting nearly 2,000 tests daily, including samples sent from centres managed by government agencies. “We’re operating at maximum capacity. However, if the demand for testing rises with the increase in cases, the existing infrastructure might not be enough,” she added. Some private labs said the current fee for testing was not enough for them to meet the break-even point. “The matter has been raised with the Centre as well as states. But there has been no redressal of our grievances or any support to scale up the infrastructure. After the first wave, the government should have called a meeting of all stakeholders to prepare a roadmap to boost infrastructure for testing,” said an Indian Medical Association member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/surge-tests-capacity-labs-say-cant-scale-up-further/articleshow/81976338.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

---||Chandigarh||Gangster Binny Gujjar granted bail by HC||Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court has granted regular bail to gangster Deepak Kumar alias Binny Gujjar and his accomplice in connection with a case of attempt to murder of a liquor contactor of Hoshiarpur in Punjab in December 2019. The other accused, who has also been granted bail along with Gujjar, is Saurav Jindal. They were booked on the basis of a disclosure statement made by a co-accused Paras Sharma that he was instructed for firing at liquor contractor’s residence by Gujjar from the jail. “The veracity of such like disclosure statements made by co-accused would be tested during the course of the trial and its admissibility would be subject to its corroboration by other evidence. Further, it remains unexplained as to how Deepak Kumar alias Binny Gujjar had access to a mobile phone while in jail. “In any case, since both the petitioners have been behind bars since the last more than one year and conclusion of trial is likely to consume time as even charges have not been framed and as many as 22 witnesses have been cited. Further detention of the petitioner will not serve any useful purpose,” observed the HC while granting bail to the accused. Justice Gurvinder Singh Gill passed these orders while allowing the bail plea of Gujjar and his accomplice Jindal. They had sought regular bail in case registered at model town police station of Hoshiarpur for attempt to murder and related charges under the Arms Act. As per the complaint given by Malkit Singh — security guard of liquor contractor Naresh Kumar, on December 20, 2019 some unknown person outside his employer’s house started firing with intention to kill him and one shot hit at his ankle. The unidentified person fled away after the firing. Counsel appearing for the gangster Binny Gujjar, advocate Mandeep Kaushik informed HC that both Gujjar and Jindal were not named in the FIR and nominated as accused on the basis of a disclosure statement allegedly made by co-accused Paras Sharma. Even as per the statement of petitioner Deepak Kumar alias Binny Gujjar was in jail at the time of occurrence in hand, Kaushik had argued. Objecting to the bail plea, counsel for the state government submitted that both the accused are habitual offenders having been involved in several cases and should not be granted bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/gangster-binny-gujjar-granted-bail-by-hc/articleshow/81976325.cms||---

---||Pune||80% Covid fatalities linked to comorbidities in Pune district||PUNE: About 80% of the total 10,339 patients succumbing to Covid-related complications in Pune district also suffered from comorbidities like hypertension or diabetes, the recent report on Covid-19 deaths by the district health office (DHO) has revealed. The report stated that 8,240 deceased also suffered from associated risk factors. Of the total Covid fatalities in the district till April 6, the maximum (5,650) occurred in the Pune municipal limits, followed by the Pimpri Chinchwad civic areas (2,094) and the rural parts (1,746), the report said. It said over 70% of the Covid deaths occurred in the 51-plus age group in the district. Based on this finding, health experts have exhorted senior citizens to take extreme precautions even after receiving both shots of the Covid-19 vaccine. Subhash Salunkhe, former director general of state health services and state Covid-19 task force member, told TOI, “The associated risk factors simply mean comorbidities. Be it hypertension, diabetes or obesity. Elderly individuals must remain vigilant about the infection spread and exercise extreme precaution by following Covid-appropriate behaviour.” Salunkhe had also contracted Covid-19 after getting vaccinated. He said clinical care management and early detection were vital to reduce the number of fatalities associated with Covid-19. “There have been many instances of patients being brought dead to the Sassoon General Hospital or in extremely critical condition with a low oxygen saturation level of 30-40%, which gives very little chance to save the person,” he said. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, Pune ZP, said, “We have managed to keep the Covid-19 deaths at the minimum level due to early detection of comorbid individuals with the help of ‘My family my responsibility’ survey. Around 5 lakh such people were identified and recommended proper medication. Our Asha workers monitored their progress.” According to Prasad, individuals with comorbidities were admitted to the dedicated Covid health centres even if they showed minor symptoms, which also helped in reducing the number of fatalities. Activist Maruti Bhapkar, however, said there was a need to strengthen the existing medical infrastructure and that various administrations had failed to do so. “The Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic administrations should increase the medical facilities on the lines of jumbo units to cater to the critical patients,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/80-covid-fatalities-linked-to-comorbidities-in-pune-district/articleshow/81977564.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Delhi||Delhi govt orders 115 private hospitals to reserve 50% beds for Covid||NEW DELHI: With the capital witnessing a massive surge of Covid-19 cases and active cases more than doubling in the last one week, Delhi government on Thursday directed 115 hospitals with 50 beds or more to reserve 50% of their total ICU and ward beds or more for Covid-19 patients. Delhi government also ordered its hospitals to deploy dental and Ayush doctors on Covid-19 duties, apart from providing sufficient manpower and infrastructure in hospital holding areas for patients. Three days ago, the government scaled up bed capacity in hospitals to treat Covid patients by increasing the number of beds for them in 11 of its hospitals by 1,540 and directed 54 large private hospitals to reserve at least 30% of their ICU and ward beds or double the occupancy, whichever was higher. The current decision was taken on Thursday in a meeting of health minister Satyendar Jain with officers of the health and family welfare department for reviewing the status of occupancy of Covid ICU and ward beds in the capital’s hospitals. The 115 private hospitals that have been directed to reserve more beds for Covid-19 patients are already identified and registered for providing Covid-related treatment. Such a hospital will now reserve 50% of bed capacity or 1.25 times the occupancy of Covid ICU and ward beds displayed on the Covid-19 management portal on Thursday, whichever is higher. These hospitals have been allowed to reserve more than the requisite beds for Covid-related treatment and temporarily increase 25% of their total bed capacity. However, the increased bed capacity will have to be used only for Covid-related treatment. The state government also directed the medical superintendents and the directors of its Covid-19 hospitals to depute sufficient manpower and infrastructure in the holding or triage areas with enough oxygen facility to avoid unnecessary wait for a long time for completing the admission procedure, which may lead to an increase in chance of spread of Covid further due to crowded area. The order states that it may be ensured that no patient is kept waiting for more than 10 minutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-orders-115-pvt-hosps-to-reserve-50-beds-for-covid/articleshow/81976381.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Delhi||Delhi’s positivity rate is lower than many states: Jain||New Delhi: Ruling out the immediate possibility of a lockdown in Delhi amid a surge in Covid-19 cases, health minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday said people were talking in extremes, with some being in favour and some against lockdown, so a middle ground had been chosen. Asked about the availability of the vaccine, the health minister said Delhi government had stocks for 4-5 days.“The infection is spreading fast among people aged between 20-45 years, who can pose a threat to the elderly at home. Therefore, vaccination should be made available to everyone. Delhi government has been demanding that the age restrictions be lifted. We have also demanded more vaccines from the Centre,” added Jain.The minister said the capital’s positivity rate was lower than other states and Delhi government was taking measures to contain it. “In all, 7,437 cases were reported on Thursday with the positivity rate being 8.1%. The positivity rate in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh is 25% and 18%, respectively. In other states, the positivity rate is above 10%,” added Jain, saying that he feared that the number of cases may break past records.“Delhi government is increasing the number of Covid beds in hospitals. Over 2,000 beds have been added in the past three days. In the next couple of days, another 2,000-2,500 beds will be increased. People complied with Covid guidelines for 2-3 months. But as soon as they became lax, the infection started impacting them. I appeal to people to strictly follow the protocol,” said Jain.Asked about the restrictions at night, the minister said there were reports about people hosting parties, which was causing unnecessary gatherings. In response to a query about the IPL match on April 29, Jain said the government would think about it later as they were concentrating on the situation at hand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhis-positivity-rate-is-lower-than-many-states-jain/articleshow/81976358.cms||---

Highlighting the grievance of the central forces, ADG (law and order) Jag Mohan, in a letter to the SPs and CEO on Wednesday, emphasized that from the fourth phase onwards, there should be proper standard vehicle in all constituencies where the central forces would be deployed. A senior EC official said that in various rural belts in South 24 Parganas, Hooghly and Howrah, the forces had to be ferried in autos and totos since the rural roads are not always accessible by four-wheelers. Even in some places, they were given motorized vans to reach the booths. AK Arya, DIG (operations) of BSF, had also pointed out their grievance in a letter to the ADG (L&O), saying the force was not given standard vehicles to reach the booths during the third phase of polling. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/central-forces-want-proper-vehicles/articleshow/81976403.cms||---

According to police, farmers in the locality saw a huge pit being dug in Jose’s land using an earthmover. Soon, three trucks came to the spot and started dumping waste into the pits. The shocked farmers mobilised a few more villagers and went to the spot. As soon as the truck drivers and their helpers saw the villagers, they fled the spot, police said.The villagers saw waste from one truck dumped into the pit and the remaining two trucks were about to dispose. They informed police and revenue department officials about the incident. Soon, a team of revenue officials headed by Anaimalai tahsildar Venkatachalam arrived at the spot along with police personnel. They found that similar pits were dug in the land and waste was dumped in the past also. Police seized the three vehicles and the earthmover.“The landowner is on the run. We have booked a case against him,” a police officer said.Villages bordering Kerala continue to witness similar incidents. Several protests were conducted in the past and revenue officials had also cracked down on the violators. But villagers said that unless vehicle checking is intensified in the border check post, the menace could not be stopped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/trucks-from-kerala-dump-medical-waste-in-pollachi-seized/articleshow/81976417.cms||---

Five patients from as far as Candolim were admitted to the hospital on Thursday as North Goa didn't have an operational Covid care centre as on Thursday. The Shyama Prasad Mukherjea stadium in Taleigao, which served as a Covid care centre for up to 250 people at the peak of the first wave last year, is being readied again, a government official said. “It will initially cater to 100-150 people, but can be scaled up as the numbers rise. The Covid care centre is for people who live in a single room and share toilet facilities and who cannot isolate themselves at home. It is also for those who require monitoring as their oxygen saturation levels fluctuate and cannot monitor themselves,” the official said.

Gorewada divisional manager (DM) Pramod Panchbhai confirmed a proposal has come under the CZA’s animal exchange program from the NZP, run by the MoEFCC, to give two tigers and two sloth bears in exchange for ungulates. Currently, there are nine tigers and four sloth bears rescued after human-animal conflict, kept at Gorewada. However, Gorewada being a rescue centre where injured or problem animals rescued from forest areas are treated and released, or those not fit for release are kept, the state chief wildlife warden will have to give formal permission for the exchange of animals. Later, the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) will take a final call. NZP director Ramesh Kumar Pandey confirmed the park has written on March 13, 2021, to zoos in Nainital, Van Vihar at Bhopal, and Gorewada at Nagpur for tigers and sloth bears. “Ours is a participating zoo for conservation breeding of five species – tigers, lions, one-horned rhinos, sangai deer, and red jungle fowl. We have successfully bred a number of endangered animals and birds.” “The zoological park needs 1:2 tigers for conservation breeding and an equal number of sloth bears for display. In exchange, the zoological park is ready to give sambars (8), albino blackbucks (10), blackbucks (10), barking deer (20) and even brow-antlered (sangai) deer, painted stork, and jackals to Gorewada,” said Pandey. Sangai deer is an endangered and endemic subspecies of brow-antlered deer found only in Manipur. Its habitat is floating marshy grasslands and hence it may find it difficult to survive in hot temperatures here. However, even as NZP is ready to give several surplus species, Gorewada has an herbivore enclosure facility and doesn’t have cages for small mammals. “At present, there are 9 tigers including two cubs in Gorewada and only 10 cages. We can give two females and one sub-adult tiger, and a pair of sloth bear (male-female) to NZP,” says Panchbhai. “Considering the chronic human-animal conflict in the region, there is a possibility of more tigers being captured in the future and hence there should be availability of enclosures in case of emergency. The herbivores which we will get in exchange can be an attraction for Indian Safari,” Panchbhai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/delhi-zoo-wants-tigers-bears-from-gorewada/articleshow/81974362.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

While Rajasthan government has already been contacted, zoo officials say they may also approach Delhi government on introducing wildlife into parts of the Ridge. The zoo has also requested the transfer of tigers and sloth bears from the Gorewada Rescue Centre in Nagpur.Ramesh Pandey, director of Delhi zoo, told TOI that apart from deer, nilgai, black buck and spotted deer, other animals could also be provided for rewilding. “We generally exchange excess animals with other zoological parks. We have already approached Rajasthan and will write to Delhi government officials soon. If required, free-ranging birds such as the painted stork can also be released,” said Pandey.Pandey also confirmed having written on March 13 to zoos in Nainital, Bhopal and Gorewada in Nagpur for tigers and sloth bears. “Ours is a participating zoo for conservation breeding of five species — tigers, lions, one-horned rhinos, sangai deer and red jungle fowl,” he said. “Delhi zoo needs two tigers for conservation breeding and an equal number of sloth bears for display from Gorewada.

Currently, nine tigers and four sloth bears rescued after human-animal conflict are kept at Gorewada. But since it’s a rescue centre rather than a zoo, the state chief wildlife warden will have to give formal permission for the exchange of animals, with CZA taking the final call.Even though fragmented, the central, southern and northern Ridge areas too could be considered for rewilding. Besides, officials at DDA’s Tilpath Valley Biodiversity Park have been looking to introduce herbivores in the nature reserve in the hope that they will automatically draw carnivores.CR Babu, head of Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems, who has been working at Tilpath Valley, said, “Animals that have been in captivity for a long time might not be able to survive in the wild easily. Young deer, however, can adapt more quickly and regain their natural instincts. While we sighted sambar deer in the park recently, we are hoping to introduce chinkara and chital now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/animal-exchange-deer-to-get-delhi-zoo-cats-and-bears/articleshow/81976433.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

A proposal sent to finance department by RTDC seeking Rs 45.50 crore grant to clear the pending retirement benefits of the employees came unstuck. When TOI contacted a senior official in the finance department, he said that the government is in favour of providing a grant or a loan, but the corporation needs to submit a revival plan. “The state government and the chief minister are very supportive of the tourism sector and RTDC is included in that. That’s why the sector has been allocated Rs 500 crore in the budget. But the corporation needs to present a revival plan based on which we will decide what benefits can be extended,” said the official. He said it’s not only the retirement benefits, there are many other areas where the corporation needs handholding. “But all depends on the roadmap the corporation prepares for its revival,” added the official. The fact that RTDC has not been able to audit its balance sheet for the past three years has also impacted its chances of creating a transparent picture of its internal working. Provisional estimates show that in 2017-18, it has run up losses of Rs 10.37 crore. In 2018-19 and 2019-20, the losses stand at Rs 11.31 crore and 12.43 crore, taking its outstanding losses to Rs 177.77 crore. Recently, the state government granted Rs 15 crore to clear the pending salaries and retirement benefits of the employees. But a member of a RTDC retired employees association said that only 5% of the Rs 15 crore has been spent for clearing dues of the retired people. He said since May 2018, the corporation has stopped depositing the Employment Provident Fund money. “We cannot withdraw the EPF money as RTDC has not been depositing the money in their EPF accounts,” said the member of the association. The senior official in the finance department said that RTDC needs to submit the revival plan by April-end. “We will look at the plan and then decide what needs to be done,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/retired-but-rtdc-employees-still-wait-for-retirement-benefits/articleshow/81976420.cms||---

Oxygen saturation level should be recorded using pulse oximeter. They should ensure that staff and customers wear masks properly and maintain social distancing. Establishments that fail to do so will face heavy fine and will be shutdown. Teams to inspect establishments in the city are already in place. Flying squads will also be formed for this purpose,” Pandian said.As many as 220 people within corporation limits are testing positive daily. Eighteen wards have been identified as hotspots. The commissioner advised people to limit crowds to 50 at functions and not to travel to other districts unnecessarily. “People can work and meet others using the internet. If travel is unavoidable, the traveller must isolate for four to five days in a room to avoid infecting others,” he said.Commercial establishments that have to follow 50% capacity from April 10, said the measures will affect their business. “People began frequenting theatres only two months ago, leading to movies like Sulthan screened to full house during weekends. Master ran for 75 days despite being released on OTT platforms,” said Srinath, general manager of PVR Cinemas. “New releases, including Dhanush-starrer Karnan, will face huge losses and other producers will hesitate to release big movies,” he told TOI.Brookefields Mall COO Ashwin Balasubramanian said they plan to implement 50% occupancy by reducing seating in the food court from 600 to 350, closing car parking when there are 350 cars compared to full capacity of 750 cars and doing the same for two-wheelers. “We have an app that count the number of people entering from all entrances. We will repurpose it to count every entrant walking in through our six entrances and ensure that there are not more than 3,500 visitors inside the mall at any given point of time, compared to our usual footfall of 14,000 on weekdays,” he said.Vaccination vans will be introduced from April 11 with 150-200 doses, Pandian said. “They will visit all streets and vaccinate residents.”The Coimbatore District Small Scale Industries Association (Codissia) has handed over hall D for the second time to the health department to establish another Covid care centre.

The woman named Shaiyaz Parveen was facing harassment from her husband Mohammed Hussain Junani as she had turned down his idea of surrogate pregnancy to have a child. The couple, married for 10 years, were not able to conceive a child despite consulting several doctors. Police said that the couple had unsuccessfully tried in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment around two years back, following which Parveen had given up hopes. For a year now, Junani had been trying to pursue Parveen for surrogate pregnancy. But as she kept refusing, Junani started harassing her. Tired of harassment, Parveen ended her life by hanging herself from a ceiling fan in her bedroom on Wednesday midnight. On Thursday, her mother Shabina Sheikh, who lives in Bharuch, lodged a complaint of abetment of suicide against Junani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/harassed-for-surrogate-pregnancy-woman-hangs-self/articleshow/81975155.cms||---

A senior official source said, “The expansion of Metro is not on cards. In the recent past, three IAS officers were posted in the department. However, scope of work is very little for a senior official at the Jaipur Metro Rail Corporation (JMRC).”The state government apparently stopped giving priority to its management after it became a loss-making entity. Sources said, “It was evident that the department is neglected as a non–IAS person was given the charge of managing director in recent past.”Sources further said at a time when tier-2 cities are launching and expanding Metro corridors with Centre’s assistance, the state capital has failed to reap the benefits as successive governments have never shown interest in the joint-venture.This has become the major reason for slow expansion of the corridor in Jaipur. In the last five years, the cash-strapped Jaipur Metro Rail Corporation (JMRC) has only constructed 2.35-km corridor.After CM Gehlot’s Budget speech announcement, the state also prepared a revised Detailed Project Report (DPR) for the Jaipur Metro-II project and brought the construction cost to Rs 4,500 crore. “On government’s direction, project cost of Jaipur Metro Phase-II has been reduced from Rs 10,000 to 4,500 crore. Serious deliberations were made to launch the project. However, it has been shelved as majority of public representatives do not want Metro on Tonk road.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-shunting-officers-to-jaipur-metro-is-stern-message/articleshow/81976471.cms||---

Racing towards a fast recovery — post pandemic — during the end of 2020, the city’s office space absorption plummeted by 61% between January and March 2021 (Q1), shows the latest office market report released by global real estate services firm, Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), on Thursday. Between October and December 2020 (Q4), Hyderabad witnessed a net absorption of 2.83 million square feet (sft) of office space. This dropped to 1.09 million sft in the first three months of the new year, the report revealed. Experts attribute this to uncertainty in the market “with respect to resumption of business as usual”. “Occupiers continued to adopt a cautious approach and focused on reassessing their real estate portfolios and long-term commitments. To add to the woes, increasing fears of a spike in Covid-19 cases in the second half of March further pushed occupiers to press pause again and postpone their real estate decisions,” said Samantak Das, chief economist and head of research and REIS, JLL (India). Completion of new projects too took a hit in the city with numbers slipping from 3.72 million sft (October to December, 2020) to 2.2 million sft (January to March, 2021). On the bright side, Hyderabad fared better than many major metros as the city, along with Bengaluru and Delhi-NCR, accounted for 80% of all office absorptions recorded during first three months of the year. “In sync with net absorption, the markets of Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Delhi NCR accounted for nearly 80% of new completions during the quarter,” the report said. Top seven metros are expected to see a net absorption of around 30 million sft in 2021. “At par with average annual net absorption levels seen during 2016-2018,” said Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyds-office-absorption-drops-by-61-still-among-top-three/articleshow/81976467.cms||---

Daily use could rise from roughly 50,000 doses to 1.5 lakh by April 30, he said. Tope held a meeting with senior executives of seven pharma companies on Thursday. “We have told them to double production. The companies should supply injections directly to government hospitals and district collectors to avoid any black marketing,” said Tope. Flying squads must be appointed in each district to prevent its unnecessary use. “Its MRP should be reduced as well to prevent profiteering,” said Tope. Tope said the companies have increased production and it will take at least 20 days for new batches to arrive. In Mumbai, several hospitals reported a shortage again on Thursday. The meeting was attended by executives from Cipla, Zydus Cadila, Hetero, Mylan Jubilant, Dr Reddy’s, Sun Pharma, officials of the Indian Pharmaceuticals Association along with FDA minister Rajendra Shingane, principal secretary Pradeep Vyas and FDA commissioner Abhimanyu Kale.

Many parking lots are lying vacant.According to officials, the economic crisis people are facing due to the pandemic has impacted on the auction of the corporations which ultimately affected the revenue of the corporation.Dilip Sharma, revenue deputy commissioner of JMC-Greater, said, “The impact of pandemic can be seen in the tenders as well. We have invited auction for many places, but there was no bidding or the bidding wasn’t sufficient. Due to imposition of nigh curfew again, the footfall in the market in the evening has gone down. So, the income of parking lots will not be up to the mark.”Similar situation was seen in the hoarding auctions of JMC-Greater. This year the revenue collection of both the corporations were low due to pandemic. The revenue collection of JMC-Heritage has been lower than the target set by the authorities. Out of the Rs 32 crore target set by the civic body, Rs 28 crore was achieved since the division of municipal corporations. JMC-Greater, however, managed to cross its Rs 42-crore target. Both the corporations have applied for loan of Rs 500 crore to carry out various functions.To tackle this situation, first hoarding and auction committee meeting was held in JMC-Greater on Thursday. It was decided that every councillor will send at least two identified sites for hoardings and parking lots in his ward. That is expected to help the JMC-Greater to earn better revenue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/a-few-bidders-for-parking-lots-and-hoarding-sites/articleshow/81976448.cms||---

The National Board of Examinations (NBE) commenced the application process for NEET-PG on February 23. Though the last date of application was March 15, all the examination centres in Hyderabad were filled up in a matter of few hours. Following this, many students had to either select districts or cities in the neighbouring states. The NBE is set to release the admit cards on April 12. “By the time I started applying, I could only select Sattupally in Telangana, which is 180 km from my hometown. There should have been more test centres so that aspirants could get options closer to their hometown,” said Sai Rajesh, an aspirant from Suryapet. With Covid cases rising across Telangana as well as other neighbouring states, aspirants are now in a state of anxiety as they will have to travel far amid the pandemic. “The cases are rising abnormally across the state. Amid all this, how does the government expect us to travel to other places to appear for an examination under so much pressure,” questioned Koushik Kumar, an aspirant who was allotted Visakhapatnam as his test centre. Many students from Bengaluru, Mysore have been allocated test centers in Hyderabad thereby reducing the chances of many local students to secure test centre in their hometowns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-spike-neet-aspirants-anxious/articleshow/81981080.cms||Preeti Biswas

According to sources, samples of a small group of Delhiites who have been vaccinated against Covid-19 may also be tested to see if they have developed antibodies. “The serological survey is scheduled to begin from Monday and all district authorities have been informed to make arrangements. The CLIA technology used last time will be repeated this time too,” said a Delhi government official. “Also, all samples will be tested at Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences to ensure that there are no variations in the results,” he said. The official added that the CLIA technology, used during the fifth survey in January, helps in getting more accurate results as the testing kits have higher sensitivity. The collection teams will ensure that at least 100 samples are collected from each of the 272 municipal wards in the city and that all age groups are proportionately represented, apart from people from all socio-economic strata. The last survey, carried out between January 15 and 23, had revealed that 56.1% Delhiites have Covid antibodies. The highest prevalence — 62.2% — was in South East district and the least among the 11 districts was in North at 49.09%. All other districts had a seroprevalence of more than 50%, including six with more than 55%. “The presence of antibodies in the population was on the higher side in the last survey as against the four surveys in 2020 that didn’t show more than 30% seroprevalance. However, many of those who had antibodies in January may not have them any longer, but that will be clear only after the results come out,” another official said. According to sources, the samples of those who have been vaccinated in Delhi may also be collected to see if they have developed antibodies. “But even after inoculation, the body takes some time for antibodies to develop and it may not reflect in the survey. There could be a separate survey for them,” he said. The first sero survey, conducted between June-end and the first week of July last year, had revealed the presence of Covid-19 antibodies in around 24% of the total 21,387 samples collected. The third survey in September showed 25.1% prevalence of antibodies, and the fourth survey that of 25.5%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/6th-sero-survey-from-monday-to-cover-28k/articleshow/81976491.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand HC stays further construction on river beds near Sahastradhara in Doon Valley||Nainital: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Thursday directed the state government and district administration of Dehradun to ensure that no further construction is raised on the river beds near Sahastradhara in Doon Valley. The court has also directed the district magistrate to inspect the area and ensure that illegal plotting and construction is immediately stopped. The directions came from the bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma as the court was hearing a PIL filed by Doon based social activist, Ajay Narain Sharma. The petition had alleged that the riverbed land was being fraudulently turned into Banjar land and sold to private parties. Sharma has said that the encroachment has been made in the upper region of Sahastradhara road on a rivulet named Aamwala Ki Rao which is now facing existential crisis because the construction and illegal plotting has led to the change in the course of the rivulet. “Even in such 'jal magna bhoomis' (water holdings), revenue records are being systematically converted into banjar bhoomi and construction has been allowed to come up and flourish, which is changing the character of the said rivulets in a pristine area of Doon Valley, even as the Doon Valley has been a notified Eco-Sensitive Area since 1989,” read the petition. “We had filed the petition saying that several acres of land on the riverbed have been termed as Banjar land and unchecked plotting is going on in the area which is affecting the sensitive ecosystem of the Doon Valley. The court has observed that it is a settled proposition in law that river land cannot be given away for plotting and therefore stayed any further construction in the area,” said Abhijay Negi, the counsel appearing for the petition. The court has now given three more weeks to the VC to file his report and listed the case for further hearing on May 6.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-hc-stays-further-construction-on-river-beds-near-sahastradhara-in-doon-valley/articleshow/81975263.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Goa||Fines can’t stop Covid, spread awareness: BJP||PANAJI: Opposing the state government’s decision to allow fining of a person more than once in a day if caught without a mask in public places, state BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade on Thursday said that this cannot be a solution. The government should instead create awareness to stop the spread of Covid, he said. “Putting double fines cannot be the solution, but creating awareness is more important. People should understand their own responsibility,” Tanavade said. Chief minister Pramod Sawant while announcing the decision on Wednesday, however, had said the penalty amount would not be increased. The state government should come out with a new standard operating procedure (SOP) so that large functions and parties don’t spread the virus, Tanavade told reporters. Last March, people were scared of Covid and police were on the streets, but now people have no fear of Covid. So, the government has to put some restrictions in place and even the police department should be made active, he said. Tanavade said that public representatives should create awareness about the spread of Covid-19. “Police should also create awareness,” he said. The state BJP president said that lockdown is not the solution. He said if new strict restrictions are introduced, then again people will blame the government. “The government is very serious about controlling the spread of Covid and the party also wants additional restrictions,” he said. Tanavade said that people should take the Covid vaccine. He said that it should be made compulsory for restaurant staff to go for Covid vaccination. “In the fight against the spread of Covid-19, everyone should take the responsibility and the law cannot always work,” he said. The opposition should not do politics over Covid, instead they should create awareness about it and that can get them more votes, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fines-cant-stop-covid-spread-awareness-bjp/articleshow/81977658.cms||---
---||World||Critics of Pakistan armed forces to face jail or fine of up to Rs 5 lakh||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s National Assembly (NA) panel has passed the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2020, aimed at penalizing anyone on charges of hatred and disrespectful behaviour against the country’s armed forces. The bill was referred to NA’s standing committee on interior on September 15, 2020, following its introduction in the lower house by a lawmaker from the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), after opposition leaders, specifically former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, had directly blamed the security establishment for all problems faced by the country. Sharif had allegedly held incumbent army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa and Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed responsible for imposing a “selected” PM, a reference to Imran Khan, through rigged 2018 elections, on the country. The introduction of the bill had also coincided with controversy around reporting by a Pakistani news website FactFocus of allegations that a former general, Asim Saleem Bajwa, did not declare millions of dollars of offshore family assets after becoming PM Khan’s special adviser. The opposition’s anti-military tirade had prompted the government to introduce a bill in the NA, seeking to jail anyone who “ridicules or brings into disrepute or defames the military”. After a detailed discussion, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Interior recommended on Wednesday that the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2020 may be passed by the lower house. Committee chairman Raja Khurram Shahzad Nawaz broke the 5-5 vote tie by voting in favour of the proposed bill. The bill proposes amendments in the Pakistan Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure. According to the proposed legislation, a person found guilty of intentional ridiculing and defaming of the armed forces or any of its member will be punished with imprisonment for a term of up to two years, or fined for up to Rs 5 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/critics-of-pakistan-armed-forces-to-face-jail-or-fine-of-up-to-rs-5-lakh/articleshow/81979383.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: District health officials gear up to tackle Covid surge, ask hospitals to stay alert||HYDERABAD: A major spike in Covid-19 cases has brought to the fore the prospect of insufficient beds to treat serious cases. To avoid repeat of the 2020 situation, health officials are trying to put in place a system so those who need hospitalisation will be able to get admission and not turned away. With chief secretary Somesh Kumar specifically asking health officials across the state to understand the gravity of the situation, officials are now on their toes. During a video conference with sarpanches and officials of panchayat raj department, panchayat raj minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao touched upon the rising cases and asked them to be more alert. In Suryapet, which was a red zone last year, collector T Vinay Krishna Reddy has asked the staff to do contact tracing, conduct tests and ensure those who test positive stay in home quarantine. There has been a significant rise in the number of Covid cases in Nizamabad too. According to reports, 96 people tested positive on April 7. The number of tests has increased with 3,333 done on a single day. Of these, 3,237 people tested negative. Nizamabad collector C Narayan Reddy asked the managements of private hospitals to be ready with the infrastructure needed, if more people infected with Covid-19 need critical care. “The situation appears to be severe and therefore hospitals should be ready to treat more patients,” the collector said, during a meeting with representatives of private hospitals. He said the situation appears to be ‘severe’ and therefore it was advisable that the government and private hospitals were on alert to admit patients. As of now, 172 Covid positive patients were taking treatment at government hospitals and at least 100 at private ones. Private hospitals have 400 beds in the district. A core committee meeting of government general hospital was held in Karimnagar. Collector K Shashanka said Covid test would have to be done for anyone coming for any ailment, if the patients shows any signs of Covid. Sports School in Karimnagar has been made a Covid Care Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dist-health-officials-gear-up-to-tackle-covid-surge-ask-hospitals-to-stay-alert/articleshow/81976513.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

Districts under the civic body have been asked to start facilities by April 11. Considering that the New Delhi area is a hub for government and private offices, organising a camp would benefit hundreds of people. “We have received applications from a couple of departments that are interested. We have asked them to identify locations on premises where arrangements can be made. Our teams will visit sites before making a final decision,” said an official from New Delhi district. Two centres in the district are testing for Covid-19 — one at Mandir Marg and the other at Charak Palika Hospital. However, NDMC issued a direction on Thursday to start a third testing centre at Birla Mandir Dharamshala with immediate effect. “The temple management will be responsible for appointing nodal officers for smooth implementation of the programme,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ndmc-readies-itself-to-start-vaccine-drive/articleshow/81976506.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Jaipur||Frequent transfers risk putting brakes on crucial reforms, initiatives||Jaipur: Frequent transfers of senior officials in departments like IT and tourism have slowed down decision-making affecting many projects and delaying revival of loss-making government ventures. The IT department is yet to roll out a new startup policy that has been in the works for nearly two years. Similarly, the Bhamashah Techno Hub, where hundreds of startups incubated after it was inaugurated in 2018, is today a shadow of its earlier self. There was no prior mechanism to renew KPMG’s contract or appoint a new agency to run the incubation centre. “The contract with KPMG expires about one and half year ago. Now, the process to appoint a new agency was set off recently for which tenders have been issued. But suddenly, there is change in leadership. It actually slows down the process which has already been delayed,” said an official in the IT department.In fact, after the Congress government came to power, department remained as an additional charge of officials heading other departments. But now with Alok Gupta, the department has got a dedicated high rank official unlike under principal secretaries Abhay Kumar and Ajitabh Sharma who had primary departments like cooperative and mines, respectively. In case of tourism, when things appeared to be settling down, again there is a change at the top. One of the major tasks of the department was to create a revival plan for debt-laden Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation (RTDC).During the early months of the current dispensation, the then tourism minister made it clear that that loss-making RTDC hotels would not be leased out and focus would be on their revival. The officials played along with him. Once the minister was removed after the political fiasco, the stance seems to have changed. The government now wants to lease out the hotels as part of the revival package. In the meantime, RTDC managing director post has been a revolving chair. Ngikya Gohain is the fourth official in the past two years to head the corporation. Now, principal secretary tourism and chairman of RTDC Alok Gupta, who recently started working on revival plan has now been shifted to IT department.“The government has already reaching halfway mark of its tenure. From next year onward, all the workings will be geared for the next elections. The previous BJP government made a similar mistake of not pursuing the RTDC reforms earlier in its tenure. A similar pattern is now playing out now. Now, by changing officials midway would not take the process too far,” said an official in the tourist department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/frequent-transfers-risk-putting-brakes-on-crucial-reforms-initiatives/articleshow/81976504.cms||---

The flyovers at Jahota, Sitapura and Bambala Puliya will ease vehicular movement. Residents alleged that the projects were already late and now these are not being opened for political reasons . Manoj Gupta, a resident of Jagatpura said, “The RoB at Sitapura was constructed after spending Rs 116 crore. The project was expected to be completed in January 2020, but it was completed late. Now that the project is ready, the residents cannot take benefit as the state government was in no mood to inaugurate it.” An official at JDA informed, the length of the Sitapura ROB is approximately 9.90 metres. Once the traffic is open, it would serve as an alternate route for Mahatama Gandhi Hospital patients, Jagatpura residents and RIICO industrial area commuters. Similarly, residents of many colonies including Swapna Lok , Kaladera industrial area , Rampura, Dabdi, Jalsu are waiting for Jahota flyover to be inaugrated, which is completed after spending Rs 54.60 crore. The Rs 21 crore road widening project of Bambala puliya situated on NH-11 (Jaipur- Tonk) , which had to be completed in 2018 was constructed recently. The project is allegedly under- utilized despite being completed. Kapil Sharma, national general secretary, People’s Green Party, said, “The government spends public money , but have no concern for them. The system of big leaders inaugurating the projects should be abolished as projects are built after spending tax payers money.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/three-robs-waiting-to-be-inaugurated/articleshow/81976509.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan government told to hold vaccination camps in offices but doses enough for just two days||JAIPUR: The state government on Thursday received the order for organising vaccination camps in offices. The health department is now encouraging private offices, communities and associations to organise camps, but with a rider that there should be at least 100 eneficiaries to get the jabs. The shortage of vaccine doses, however, might be a deterrent in scaling up the drive as the state currently has just 13-14 lakh doses, which will get exhausted within two days. Also, there is no communication from the Centre for supplying vaccine doses to the state in near future. Health department officials said they have not received information from the Centre about the next supply of Covid vaccines. The Centre has asked the state to scale up the vaccination drive. “Covid vaccination sessions may be organised at workplaces which are having about 100 eligible and willing beneficiaries (to facilitate optimal utilisation of vaccine dosage and reduce wastage) for vaccination. Organising vaccination at workplace will not only be convenient to the staff, but also help to avoid travel and hence reduce risk of exposure to Covid virus,” Centre told the states. The Centre said, “In order to increase the access of vaccine to people above 45 years of age, vaccination sessions may be organised at workplaces (public and private) which are having about 100 eligible and willing beneficiaries by tagging these work places with an existing Covid vaccination Centre. The private organisations, clubs, colleges have scheduled vaccination sessions for Friday including the Pink City Press Club.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-told-to-hold-vax-camps-in-offices-but-doses-enough-for-just-two-days/articleshow/81976507.cms||---
---||Mumbai||CCTV footage helps GRP nab man who stole Rs 27 lakh gold in Mumbai||MUMBAI: A Govandi labourer was arrested for stealing a co-passenger’s bag containing gold jewellery worth Rs 27 lakh from the platform at Lokmanya Tilak Terminus. Hasan Shaikh (25) was tracked down to Kalburgi in Karnataka by a GRP crime branch team after analysing CCTV footage and ticket-booking records. Balaji Devendra and his family, all Sion-Koliwada residents, were on their way to Coimbatore for a wedding on May 3. They boarded the S-11 coach of Coimbatore Express but while counting their bags inside they could not find one which had gold jewellery. They realised the bag had been stolen from the platform, so Devendra lodged a complaint with Kurla GRP. The crime branch started a parallel probe and checked CCTV footage of the platform. A man was captured picking up Devendra’s bag besides his own. He was also seen boarding another coach. Police checked CCTV footage at subsequent halts and at Kalburgi station, he was captured on camera alighting. “We analysed ticket-booking records and narrowed down a list of passengers booked up to Kalburgi. Eight tickets were booked by a travel agent from Mumbai. We showed him footage of the theft and he identified Shaikh,” said investigating officer Hemraj Sathe. Police got Shaikh’s number from the agent, tracked down his phone location in Kalburgi, and arrested him on Wednesday. “The jewellery was recovered,” said senior inspector Shailendra Dhiwar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cctv-footage-helps-grp-nab-man-who-stole-rs-27-lakh-gold-in-mumbai/articleshow/81977721.cms||---

He held a meeting with minister Satyendar Jain and senior officials from Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board and Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation to review the progress of the flats being constructed under the scheme for families living in slums. The state government has kept the scheme, which was part of the party’s poll promise, in the priority list. It is aimed at lifting the living standard of the slum dwellers. Kejriwal directed the officials that any problems coming in the implementation of the scheme should be brought to his notice so that they can be effectively removed and families can be shifted to their new homes. “Delhi government is committed to giving a life of dignity to families living in slums. It is going to provide flats in different areas of Delhi to the families living in slums under the ‘Jahan Jhuggi, Wahin Makan’ scheme,” the government stated. Under the scheme, 52,344 flats are being built in the first phase by Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board and Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation. Construction of 18,084 flats is under way and all of them are nearing completion. 34,260 flats are being built by DSIIDC of which 17,660 flats are ready, while 16,600 flats are under construction. Apart from these, 4,833 flats have been allotted to the homeless families living in slums, while the process of allocation of 7,031 flats is likely to be completed soon. A total of 89,400 flats are to be built in three phases for the homeless families living in slums under the scheme. These flats will be built on 237 acres of land in various areas of Delhi. Delhi government is building 52,344 flats in the first phase. These are set to be allotted by 2022. In the second phase, about 18,000 flats are to be built. The remaining flats are to be built in the third phase on the land that will be vacant after shifting homeless families to the flats built in the first two phases. The target is to complete the three phases by 2025.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/expedite-flat-allotment-for-slum-dwellers-cm/articleshow/81976511.cms||AlokKNMishra

---||Hyderabad||IIIT-Hyderabad developing method to detect spam emails||HYDERABAD: Vexed with getting spam emails that contain text inside an image? It might soon be a thing of the past as researchers at the International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad (IIIT-H) have been working on creating a system that can read and recognize information that is in the form of an image, such as a scanned document or a picture of a street sign. In collaboration with Computer Vision Centre (CVC), Barcelona, the researchers at Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT), IIIT-H are trying to make document image analysis more fluent and interactive. They said that spammers typically embed a bit of text inside images in a bid to circumvent spam-blocking software as there is still no easy way for computers to read and recognise information that is in the form of an image. “As a community, we are now looking for a superior understanding beyond just recognition,” said CV Jawahar, head of CVIT. He said that they are creating a system that can initiate a dialogue with different forms of written text such as that in a document, a book, an annual report, a comic strip, and so on. “Known as Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA), research here is centered around guiding machines to understand human requests and respond appropriately to them, eventually in real-time,” said Jawahar. The researchers said that the questions could range from very simple ones such as asking the system to identify what is in the image (for instance, is it a person, an animal, a food item, etc.), to the more complex — identifying persons (if it is a celebrity, system is asked to identify who the celebrity is) and what is happening in the image.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iiit-h-developing-method-to-detect-spam-emails/articleshow/81976524.cms||---

Police booked 23 people for attacking each other with wooden sticks, iron pipes and pelting stones. According to police, the sarpanch of Vadadla village had forged a compromise between the Gohil and Pathan families on April 6. Gohil’s nephew was in a relationship with Pathan’s daughter due to which the atmosphere in the village had become tense. To avoid any untoward incident, the sarpanch held a meeting of the two families and it was decided that the members of the two families won't meet or talk to each other. On the night of April 6, a member of Gohil’s family went to Pathan’s house and created a ruckus over the compromise. Feeling insulted, around 11 of Pathan’s relatives reached Gohil’s house and attacked them. In response, a dozen people from Gohil’s family and neighbourhood switched off lights and made a counter attack. Police reached the village and brought the situation under control and shifted six people to a referral hospital in Jarod.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/couples-interfaith-relationship-sparks-tension-in-savli-6-hurt/articleshow/81975295.cms||---

Maharashtra lost 2,100 people in the first week of April, just a few hundred short of the toll for all of March, when 2,495 persons died of Covid-19. On Thursday, deaths climbed steeply to 376 in Maharashtra, the highest since October 2, when 424 fatalities occurred. In September, the worst month of the pandemic in Maharashtra, 11,975 deaths were recorded. In Mumbai, cases dropped 15%, to 8,938 from 10,442 a day before. “The positivity rate in the city, too, has been lower for last three days,” additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said. State relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar hinted at placing some restrictions on the local tain travel for the general public. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the cases were going up but the case fatality rate (CFR) in the state was low. In February the CFR was 0.8%, which fell to 0.4% in March, and it was 0.5% in the first week of April. One of the 30 central team of experts visiting Maharashtra studied jumbo hospitals and vaccine centres in Mumbai on Wednesday. “They seemed satisfied with our isolation as well as vaccine facilities at the BKC jumbo facility,” Kakani said. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said the team would visit containment zones and more hospitals over the next two or three days. Both the state and Mumbai have been doing high number of tests. Thackeray said the state was conducting over two lakh tests per day, of which 71% were done using the RT-PCT method. Mumbai did 49,000 tests. “Of these over 34,000 were RT-PCR while 15,000 were antigen tests,” Kakani said. Dharavi detected 99 cases, one of the highest single-day figures there. Kalyan-Dombivli recorded 1,224 cases and four deaths, taking the tally to 89,758 and toll to 1,282. In Thane, 1,829 cases and seven deaths were registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-sees-2100-fatalities-in-1st-week-of-the-month/articleshow/81977743.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Dehradun||‘Over 50% van panchayats dysfunctional in Uttarakhand’||Dehradun: Uttarakhand, home to the country’s oldest forest management system - van panchayats (VPs) - constituted of villagers living near the forest fringes, has only 5,500 functional ones out of 11,522. Even though the VPs were formed in the hills in 1931 under the Indian Forest Act, 1927, to empower villagers to look after and protect the forests in their area, their powers have been repeatedly curtailed with successive amendments to the Act in 1976, 2001, 2005 and 2012. Although around 7.32 lakh hectares forest area in the state is currently estimated to be under the van panchayats, it has been almost a decade now that at least half of the VPs are yet to undergo elections, a senior official of the state forest department said. Uttarakhand which is battling wildfires could have saved its forests provided the VPs were given the right resources and direction, community members say. “Bageshwar has 824 VPs and only 100 have received funds of Rs 10,000 per panchayat to douse fires. Similarly, Champawat has 700 VPs and none of them have received funds. The locals use twigs and traditional methods to douse forest fires. Even till date, nothing has been modernised,” said Puran Singh Rawat, president, Van Panchayat Sarpanch Union of Bageshwar. Uttarakhand’s first van panchayat was established in Almora, and its present sarpanch Anand Kumar also agrees that a lot more needs to be done. “We need proper equipment to douse fires. VPs are ill-equipped to counter any kind of emergency be it forest fires or wild animal attacks,” Kumar said. Veteran Almora-based environmentalist Radha Bhatt, 88, told TOI that there is a need to win the "confidence of the villagers" to protect forests from fires. “Some mahila mangal dals and VPs are active. But, they refrain from entering the reserved forests even if there are fires as they are afraid of forest officials. The villagers and forests have to join hands, only then forests can be protected from these devastating fires,” she said. Acknowledging that VPs need to be nurtured, a senior forest official said, “Uttarakhand has a long way to go in terms of managing its VPs. Squeezed between revenue and forest departments, these unique entities of the country are losing their past glory.” When contacted, principal chief conservator of forests, van panchayat, Jyotsna Sitling, said, “The VPs have already been sanctioned more than Rs 11 crore in 2020-21. Almost all the VPs have been provided funds under various schemes. We are planning amendments in the VP policy in favour of the villagers so that they generate livelihood through the forest and also ensure their conservation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/over-50-van-panchayats-dysfunctional-in-uttarakhand/articleshow/81975301.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Nagpur||Thali Bajao, Sarkar Jagao: Traders stage protest over Covid restrictions||Nagpur: Protests by traders against the 25-day Covid-induced restrictions continued on Thursday, especially in Sitabuldi, Dharampeth, Jaripatka, Ganjakhet and Central Avenue. Sitabuldi Merchants’ Association (SMA), along with other traders’ associations including the 150-member parent body Nag Vidarbha Chambers of Commerce (NVCC), staged ‘thali bajao, sarkar jagao’ agitation in the city to protest against the state government’s “oppressive steps” to check the spread of coronavirus. They exhorted the government to revoke the restrictions without delay. “As chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had on Wednesday assured to announce the state’s decision on whether or not non-essential shops will be allowed to open on April 9, we will wait till Friday morning,” the agitated traders said. NVCC president Ashwin Mehadiya, SMA executive members Hussain Ajani and Parag Thakkar said they were firm on their plan to open shops if the government failed to withdraw the lockdown restrictions. Mehadiya demanded that the CM allow all shops to function in the city and across the state. The “oppressive” lockdown and the resultant loss of earnings may claim more lives than the virus itself, some traders said. Restaurant owners and staff too protested against the Covid-19 restrictions under #MissionRoziRoti by organizing silent protests outside many hotels and restaurants across the city. In view of the rising Covid cases, the state government had imposed lockdown-like restrictions on restaurants and shops dealing in non-essential goods/services till April 30, while allowing restaurants to carry on delivery/takeaway facility from 7am to 8pm everyday. This situation has caused immense financial and economic pressure on the hospitality industry. As a result, the Hotels and Restaurants Association (Western India), the Association of Hotels and Restaurants and the National Restaurants Association of India joined hands to form the United Hospitality Forum of Maharashtra (UFHM) to protest against the stringent curbs imposed by the government. Accordingly, a call for silent protest was made as the first step under #MissionRoziRoti initiated by UFHM, asking restaurant and hotels owners along with staff to assemble outside their establishments while maintaining Covid distancing with masks, and to hold placards and posters in protest. Several members of Nagpur Residential Hotels Association (NRHA), Nagpur Eatery Owners Association and Hotel Association, Nagpur supported and participated in the silent protest. NRHA president Tejinder Singh Renu said restaurant owners were facing extreme financial crunch as the timing of online food sale permitted by the state government was “absolutely illogical”. “Even when restaurants were permitted to remain open, they were asked to down shutters at 7pm. How can any restaurant survive amid such illogical timings when the main business happens during dinner time,” he added. Another unfortunate part, said Renu, was the “stepmotherly treatment” meted out to the rest of Maharashtra — where restaurants were asked to close online food sale in the night — as against Mumbai, where online food delivery is allowed 24 hours. “Our staff is worried and many are opting to seek jobs in neighbouring states.” Renu cautioned the state government and administration that NRHA’s patience was running out, and that the hospitality sector needed some logical relaxations to avoid intensified protests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/thali-bajao-sarkar-jagao-traders-stage-protest-over-covid-restrictions/articleshow/81976533.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Rajkot||Cases multiply but addition of beds at tardy pace||Rajkot: While number of cases are rising steadily, Rajkot city is struggling with the shortage of beds to treat Covid patients. Rajkot is registering 300 new cases per day and even as the district administration and RMC is struggling to manage more beds, private hospitals are still reluctant to get fire NOC because of strict rules. Nearly 80 percent of private hospitals don’t meet the requirement of new fire safety norms. Norms have become stricter after the fire incident in Uday Shivanand hospital in November last year in which six lives were lost, following which many private hospitals had closed their Covid facilities. The district administration data states there were 817 Covid beds vacant in Rajkot on April 1, while on Wednesday only 393 were vacant and that too after a new facility of 110 beds in Samras hostel was created. According to Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC), the city has more than 1,700 active cases which has exhausted the existing combined bed capacity of government and private hospitals in the city. The situation has particularly worsened owing to severe cases of Rajkot and also neighbouring districts like Morbi and Surendrangar being referred to the city. When the pandemic was in its peak in September-October last year, there were 32 private hospitals treating Covid patients in the city, while currently only 19 private hospitals have these facilities. Of these, five hospitals are very big scale hospitals where middle class people can’t afford the fees. A senior officer in RMC told TOI that before the Shivanand hospital fire incident, NOC were granted to those hospitals who have accommodation facility in hostel or hotel and also that hospitals had fire NOC of commercial buildings. “Now the norms of fire NOC have been upgraded and fire audit committee grants NOC to only those buildings that meet all the requirements to be used for hospital purpose only,” the official added. Praful Kamani, president of Rajkot Medical Association said, “Nearly 80% hospitals of Rajkot do not meet RMC’s new requirement for fire NOC. We had a meeting with the collector on Monday and suggested to remain liberal inNOC norms looking at the spike in the cases. The beds in most of the private hospitals are full currently and if beds are not increased, we may have to shift patients to Ahmedabad if this peak will continue for one more week.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/cases-multiply-but-addition-of-beds-at-tardy-pace/articleshow/81975308.cms||---

Forensic experts are now collecting fingerprint details from other districts in the state.”He said while the special teams had collected more than 100 CCTV footages so far, they hadn’t received any vital clues.In the second case, gold ornaments weighing 100 sovereigns were stolen from the house of 42-year-old C Karthik, of Dr Rajendra Prasad Road at Tatabad, on January 17, when he was away in Bengaluru with his family. In this case too, police had formed two special teams to nab the burglars.“We were too busy with the assembly election work, for which the special team members were also roped in. They have returned to normal duty on Thursday and are working on various angles to nab the burglars,” another police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/police-yet-to-crack-house-break-ins/articleshow/81976526.cms||A Subburaj

The state health department officials said that the dip is not due to unavailability of vaccines. Dr Nayan Jani, state immunization officer, said that the state has 15 lakh doses and the state is expected to get new shots soon. “Thus, we have encouraged all centres to improve their vaccination coverage,” he said. Tagore Hall, one of the biggest AMC-run vaccination centres, wore a deserted look on Thursday afternoon, officials, however, claimed that it’s because of the working day. “Numbers increase manifold during weekends,” said an official. Compared to 22,712 vaccinations in a day on April 6, on Thursday city recorded 19,549. Majority of the educational institutes based in Ahmedabad have initiated vaccination programme for their staff.

Increasing the availability of crucial medications was also one of their demands.Since none of their demands were met, close to 100 postgraduate students went on an indefinite strike on Wednesday. Dr Prenav, one of the doctors, said, “Our main issue is lack of facilities for doctors on Covid-19 duty to stay or quarantine. After our protests, we were shifted from a dormitory to the third floor of CRRI hostel, where we have individual rooms. But we must share a common toilet.

---||Goa||Film shootings without approval illegal: Entertainment Society of Goa||PANAJI: The entertainment society of Goa (ESG) has warned of initiating legal proceedings against those involved in carrying out film shootings without obtaining necessary permissions. Calling such shootings ‘illegal’, the ESG has said that there is a spate of incidents wherein film shootings are being done without its knowledge. The ESG is the nodal agency for providing the no-objection certificate (NOC) for film shootings in Goa. The ESG has demanded that “all film shootings being undertaken in Goa, mandatorily require a NOC from the ESG. Those violating the norm will be liable to face action as per the law.” The current procedure for obtaining film shooting permissions need to start with a request to be submitted at the office of the ESG from the registered line producers and Goan production houses. The requests are processed by the society by notifying or seeking permissions from various departments/agencies applicable. The NOC is issued only after carrying out due procedures. It charges an amount of Rs 10,000 from the applicant as processing fees and panchayats concerned get a revenue share of Rs 3,000. The other agencies/departments also charge a fee for shooting locations under their jurisdiction as per applicability. “Only after completion of the payment and processing, the NOC is issued by ESG for the shooting permissions in the state of Goa.” the ESG stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/film-shootings-without-approval-illegal-esg/articleshow/81977744.cms||---

The forest department had initially attempted to chase the tusker away into forest area, but in vain. Subsequently, foresters tranquilized and captured the elephant on Wednesday. Later, it was taken to the MTR in a truck.L C S Srikanth, deputy director, MTR-buffer zone, confirmed that the tusker was released in Asuvaramattam area on Thursday early morning. “The tusker seems to be docile. A special team has been formed to monitor the animal’s movement. Hopefully, the pachyderm would not have any problem in the new place. Recently, we had created a forest pond, which has a capacity to store 50,000 litres water, near Asuvaramattam with solar energized bore well motor.” Residents of Masinagudi and Vazhaithottam areas are, however, not happy with the forest department’s move of translocating the tusker to the MTR.A resident of Gudalur area said, “Already, there is a growing man-elephant conflict in Gudalur range. Leaving a rogue elephant in the MTR is a cause for concern for us all.”It is to be noted that the MTR buffer zone is tucked in between Gudalur forest division and Masinagudi area and the tusker could stray into both the places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/rogue-tusker-caught-near-dharmapuri-released-in-mtr/articleshow/81976538.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra seeks oxygen, 1,200 ventilators from Centre||MUMBAI: After requesting PM Modi to address leaders across parties to stop politics over the pandemic, CM Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday asked the Centre for more vaccine stocks, medical equipment and even oxygen, while suggesting curbs on misuse and export of Remdesivir that is being used to treat Covid patients. He reiterated the demand to allow vaccination of everyone above 25 and said the Centre should let Haffkine Institute in the state manufacture vaccine. A proposal has been sent to the Centre, and once approved, the facility can generate 228 million doses per year. There is a shortage of vaccine in the state and some vaccination centres are shut. “The central government has said 17.4 lakh doses will be given after April 15. The delay will hamper the vaccination drive. Therefore, vaccine stocks should be delivered as per our demand,” said Thackeray. The state needs 40 lakh doses every week to meet its objective of vaccinating 1.8 crore people in the priority groups. So far, 1.06 crore doses have arrived and 92-95 lakh have been administered. With active cases going up in the state, Thackeray said the requirement for oxygen is set to rise and sought the Centre’s assistance for adequate supply. “It is expected that the demand for medical oxygen will go up to 1,700-2,500 MT by the end of this month,” said Thackeray. The state’s oxygen production capacity is 1,200 MT. Maharashtra sought 1,200 more ventilators and repairing of some given earlier. As on Thursday, 40% of ventilator beds in the state were occupied, it was pointed out. Thackeray also asked the Drugs Controller General of India to curb the misuse of injection Remdesivir and stop its export. “As of today, 50-60,000 vials oare being used (for treatment), which will go up to 1 lakh in the next few days. ICMR should finalise a use protocol,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-seeks-oxygen-1200-ventilators-from-centre/articleshow/81977769.cms||Bhavika Jain

During the discussion held at the CM’s office at the Secretariat in Porvorim, the chief minister informed the MBA that in the hearing held on April 5, the Supreme Court has clubbed the special leave petitions filed by Goa, Maharashtra and Karnataka and directed the superintending engineers of the Joint Inspection Team to file independent reports within one week. Following their joint inspection on March 19, the team had failed to reach a consensus and each state has filed their report independently. Goa filed its report of the findings made by the supretending engineer of WRD Goa, M K Prasad, at the Kankumbi project site, on Thursday. “We are making best efforts to protect Goa’s interest. Superintending engineers of Karnataka and Maharashtra each submitted their reports independently,” advocate general Devidas Pangam said. Chief engineer of WRD Goa, Shrikant Patil said, “Scientists of National Institute of Hydrology will visit Goa again in the second half of May 2021 to conclude the salinity studies and thereafter submit their final report to the Union Jalshakti Ministry.” “The SC had disposed our petition as the senior counsel of Karnataka assured the apex court that they will not divert or utilise the Kalasa water. However, it has been noticed that Karnataka has been playing tricks and is diverting the Kalasa waters into the Malprabha basin. We have to plan our strategy to restrain Karnataka’s violations,” Nirmala said.

Then, these documents have to be submitted by the hospitals via email at the collector office. We have asked the hospitals to send their representatives to collect the injections,” Patel said.  He said there is no shortage of Remdesivir injections in last 20 hours ending Thursday, 2,882 injections have been allotted to different hospitals in the city through this system.

---||Delhi||Mughal Structure Gets New Life As Partition Museum||New Delhi: All this time, the Dara Shikoh Library has had an unnoticed existence on the Kashmere Gate campus of Ambedkar University Delhi. It lay hidden behind British columns and a large roof, looking more like a colonial building than a Mughal structure. Now after four years of conservation work, the building stands ready to be resurrected as the Partition Museum of Delhi. The Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach) began work to conserve the structure in March 2017 and now there are only the final touches to be administered. Dara Shikoh, the eldest son of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, was known for his intellectual pursuits and had established a library in 1637 near Kashmere Gate. He was killed in battle for power by his younger brother and later emperor Aurangzeb. According to Intach engineer Sagar, the lime plastering on the Mughal structure had completely eroded. “The building has a history of adaptive reuse, including as an office. Now, since it is to become a museum, we are making some more changes,” said Sagar. Before its transformation into a cultural space with three museums, one on the Partition, another housing Delhi’s historical artefacts and the third on Dara Shikoh himself, the library saw a chequered history. After the death of the prince in battle, the building was given to Donna Juliana, the Portuguese governess of the royal Mughal children after whom Sarai Julena near Jamia Millia Islamia is named. Then it came into the possession of Mughal elite Nawab Safdarjung and later of Sir David Ochterlony, British resident to the Mughal court. The building also housed a government college, a municipal school and the office of the state archaeology department. Sagar explained that the conservation project involved keeping intact the Mughal and the colonial features. “The Mughal arches are what remain of the original building. We strengthened and cleaned the structure. We also strengthened the wall built with lakhori bricks at the rear, filling in the gaps there,” the engineer said. Toilets will be installed, the backyard will be developed, and landscaping will be done at the front. According to Kishwar Desai, chair of The Arts and Cultural Heritage Trust, which will develop the Partition Museum as part of the government of India’s Adopt a Heritage: Apni Dharohar, Apni Pehchaan project, “the idea is to turn the historical complex into a cultural hub. She said that using the library space will honour its history. The Partition Museum is being created and, according to Desai, will be Daastaan-e-Dilli, in which the city will be showcased “in three phases of its evolution”. Desai added that discussions were going on about the creation of a separate entrance for the museum and for collaboration with the AUD faculty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mughal-structure-gets-new-life-as-partition-museum/articleshow/81996021.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

The strike affected wheat procurement till the evening, after which the district administration resumed operations with the help of a group of 200 commission agents (arhtiyas) led by Dharmbi Padha, who came out in support of the government over the procurement process.

Sources in the food and civil supplies department said the state’s delegation, led by the group of ministers, has conveyed Union food minister Piyush Goyal, that Punjab now has no other option and will work out a new system after the chief minister takes a final call. The brainstorming will begin with a series of meetings on Friday. First, food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu will meet chief minister Amarinder Singh at 10am and later various options will be put before the arhtiyas in a subsequent meeting. A new mechanism is likely to be unveiled by the evening, added sources. In their meeting with Goyal, the state’s delegation pointed out that the matter will be formally put up before chief minister Amarinder Singh as the latter had made a commitment to arhtiyas in 2018. Meanwhile, sources added that the Punjab government already had the technology ready to roll out the DBT system. “The idea had been that the procurement scheduled to begin from April 10 should run smoothly and technically the food and supplies department is ready to roll out a new system,” said an official. Earlier, speaking after the meeting with Goyal, Ashu said procurement and payment to farmers will not be impacted by the Centre’s decision to reject Punjab’s request to defer the DBT system for some more time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pb-may-unveil-new-system-today/articleshow/81976561.cms||Vibhor Mohan

The region recorded a drop of 20% in inoculation due to lack of vaccines from the state government. Overall 53,750 took the jab in Nagpur division as compared to 67,504 a day earlier. Gondia, the worst affected district, reported even lower inoculation figures at 254. Nagpur district’s tally slipped to 34,693 from over 41,000 a day ago. Local bodies were unable to provide fresh stock while public centres were managed through redistribution of vials. All districts in the regions are left with just a day or two of stock. In Nagpur city, no vaccination was performed at 21 centres comprising private hospitals and urban primary health centres (UPHCs) within the municipal limits. Less number of centres were opened on Thursday in Nagpur. While 183 centres carried out the drive on Wednesday, 162 were open on Thursday, of which 21 had no doses left. Officials from the deputy director of health services admitted that Covaxin doses were completely exhausted. “The vaccination drive is very much on though it may be over at some places. The government is well aware of the situation,” they said. Officials defended the ongoing crisis saying “it is not an emergency drug. It would be given if available”. In Chandrapur, the health department closed down 96 centres after running out of Covishield vaccine stock on Thursday. The vaccination drive is likely to be stopped till next week when fresh vaccine stock is likely to be delivered, but officials were unsure of the date of delivery. “All the vaccination centres, except two where Covaxin is being given, will be closed from Friday. We have sought 1.30 lakh doses from the government. However, delivery is not likely to come till next week,” civil surgeon Dr Nivrutti Rathod told TOI. In Yavatmal, no centre in the urban areas had vaccine. As the stock was exhausted, the administration was forced to pull down shutters at urban centres. District collector Amol Yedge said doses may come on Friday and the centres would start functioning thereafter. Vaccination drive in Chandrapur had begun on January 16, with 1.48 lakh beneficiaries including frontline workers taking the jab till Wednesday. They include 51,790 persons who have taken both doses of vaccine. As far as vaccination of common people is concerned, 77,310 senior citizens have received the first dose while 536 have taken the second dose. Also 19,169 citizens with comorbidities have taken the first dose while 109 have taken the second dose. Around 6,000-8,000 persons are vaccinated per day at the 98 centres in Chandrapur. The health department had to close down 33 centres on Thursday following shortage of vaccine. Only 65 vaccination centers were operational during the day and around 4,800 persons were vaccinated. Many of these centers pulled down their shutters midway after exhausting their vaccine stock. In Chandrapur city, six out of eight vaccination centres went out of stock on Thursday. “We have 3,600 doses of Covaxin. Hence, centres at Chandrapur Government Medical College and Hospital and at WCL area hospital at Lalpeth will remain operational till the stock of Covaxin is there,” said Dr Avishkar Kahndre, chief medical officer of Chandrapur Municipal Corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/many-vaccine-centres-across-region-shut-figures-slide/articleshow/81976572.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Also, a letter sent by Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative (Iffco) marketing director to state marketing managers on April 7 on revision in MRP of complex fertilisers from April 1 has deepened suspicions of farmers in Punjab. However, Iffco in a quick rebuttal aimed at ending apprehensions of farmers, said on Thursday it will sell 11.26 LT of complex fertiliser at old rates only “The material with new rates is not for sale to farmers. It has been sent from plants to fields for storage purpose. The selling price of the same might come down while the old stock is finished. Printing of MRP on bags is mandatory in order to move the inventory from the plants. Tentative DAP/NPK cost printed on bags now moved from plants in April 2021 is based on the current raw material prices to be applicable on fresh stocks only,” Iffco CEO and managing director U S Awasthi said in a series of tweets on Thursday. “Aggressive negotiations with international raw material suppliers for price reduction are yet inconclusive. We are trying our best to get the prices reduced for the benefit of farmers,” he added. However, farmers are worried that they will have to pay a steep increase in price of the new stock of fertilisers. BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri said though the Iffco has announced it will sell fertilisers on old rates, how long will it continue to do so. When the old stock expires, the prices will be hiked, he added. BKU (Dakonda) general secretary Jagmohan Singh said the prices of fertilisers are set to increase as the Centre wanted to punish farmers for struggle against farm laws. According to the details, MRP of diammonium phosphate and nitrogen phosphorous potassium had been revised. From Rs 24,000 per MT and Rs 1,200 per bag of 50 kg, the price of DAP would be Rs 38,000 per MT and Rs 19,00 per bag 50 kg from April 1. Likewise, from Rs 23,500 MT and Rs 1,175 per bag of NPK (10:26:26), the rates would be increased to Rs 35,000 MT and Rs 1,775 per 50 kg. The rates of NPK (12:32:16) were revised from Rs 23,700 MT and Rs 1,185 per 50 kg to Rs 36,000 MT and Rs 1,800 per 50 kg and the rates of NPK (20:20:0:13) from Rs 18,500 MT and Rs 925 per 50 kg to Rs 27,000 MT and Rs 1,350 per 50 kg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-farmers-worried-as-fertiliser-rates-set-to-be-hiked/articleshow/81976566.cms||---

In order to prevent further spread of the virus and to manage Covid-19 situation, NCH has decided to discontinue its OPD services and give its full attention and resources to Covid-19 patients. “As coronavirus cases are on the rise, we have decided to close all OPD consultations at NCH. However, emergency services will remain open at NCH,’’ said NCH’s statement on Thursday. According to sources, as on Wednesday evening, out of the total 1500 Covid-19 beds at NCH, 929 were occupied which is 62% occupancy and increasing day by day. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/as-cases-surge-nch-closes-opd/articleshow/81975352.cms||---

Meanwhile, 70% of the total 84 lakh MT of solid waste generated in the state was scientifically treated in the previous financial year. While the total waste generated was similar in volume as in 2018-19, only 53% of it was treated. Nandkumar Gurav, regional officer, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, said, “Of the daily waste generated, 22,685 tonne or 98.7% was being collected and 15,980 tonne or 70% was being scientifically treated. The waste being scientifically treated has touched 80% in 2021. We are finding it very difficult to audit waste generation and need a common platform to address this, and this is a key recommendation from MPCB to be included in the State Climate Action Plan.” Satish Sinha, associate director, Toxics Link, said, “There is an urgent need for a policy that will ensure that the informal sector recycling e-waste is aligned.” The data was shared with a panel of experts, members of civil society along with government officials in an e-consultation on waste management, hosted by non-profit Waatavaran Foundation and organised by Climate Voices, a collective, along with the state environment and climate change department’s Majhi Vasundhara initiative. Manisha Mhaiskar, principal secretary, environment department, said the administration should engage with the community to improve waste management systems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-just-1-e-waste-recycled-70-of-solid-waste-treated-in-19-20/articleshow/81976576.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Forest Research Institute closed for outsiders after trainee officers from 5 states test Covid +ve||Dehradun: The Central Academy for State Forest Service (CASFS) in the Doon-based Forest Research Institute (FRI) premises has reported that 14 trainee forest service officers have been found positive at the academy. “The trainees from five states —Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, Himachal, Bihar and UP —have tested positive while the result of 96 students and staff is still awaited. Everyone has been moved to the academy's south hostel,” said Kunal Satyarthi, principal, CASFS. The FRI administration has also shut down its sprawling green campus for outsiders as well as morning walkers. It may remain closed till April 18. The probationers had returned from their respective homes and now they will undergo online studies at least for the next fortnight. They will pass out from the academy in July, according to Satyarthi. The campus houses some of the premier forestry institutions of the country such as Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy (IGNFA), CASFS, Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education and FRI. Last year, too, the FRI premises was shut for outsiders after the state recorded its first official case from IGNFA. The premises were closed for over a month then. Meanwhile, as many as 91 people related to ONGC were reported to have tested Covid-positive on Thursday. At least 44 are ONGC employees while the rest are their family members. Around six are admitted at ONGC hospital while one is said to be critical. Confirming the infection at ONGC, director general of health, Dr Tripti Bahuguna told TOI, “These are cumulative figures since March 25, while on Thursday, there were 10 cases at ONGC. All the individuals are in home isolation due to mild symptoms. Only one of them is critical, who is admitted at the hospital.” Furthermore, at IIT-Roorkee, 20 more students and teachers tested Covid-positive on Thursday, taking the overall cases to 129, according to an official. Uttarakhand recorded 787 positive cases on Thursday and three deaths. The fatalaties were reported from Kotdwar, Roorkee and Dehradun. Currently, the state continues to have 5,052 active cases. So far, the state has recorded 105,498 positive cases and 1,744 deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/forest-research-institute-closed-for-outsiders-after-trainee-officers-from-5-states-test-covid-ve/articleshow/81975381.cms||Shivani Azad

We have informed them about the steps being taken to contain the spread of the virus,” Patel added.“The number of patients getting admitted in hospitals in Surat every day with serious infections is considerably higher than last year. On an average, 250 coronavirus patients are getting admitted in hospitals every day in the city. The administration is trying to provide health services but given the situation, the present health infrastructure may not be enough if people do not follow Covid-19 guidelines,” Patel warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/central-team-assesses-surat-situation/articleshow/81975375.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: HC relief for ex-chairman of SBI, travel restrictions lifted||MUMBAI: In a relief to ex-chairperson of State Bank of India (SBI), O P Bhatt, who had been called for questioning by the CBI in connection with bank loans to Vijay Mallya’s Kingfisher Airlines, Bombay high court has set aside travel restrictions imposed on him. The high court bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale on Thursday allowed him to travel abroad, but directed him to keep the agency informed of his arrival, departure and details of the trip. The HC said that since Bhatt “is not arraigned as accused for cognizable offence and he was merely called for questioning only once by CBI in connection with the case of Kingfisher Airlines, travel restrictions could not have been imposed upon him.” Bhatt, 69, had petitioned the HC against the travel restrictions and look out circular (LOC) issued against him. Senior counsel Prasad Dhakephalkar and advocate Ishwar Nankani said he was “wrongly detained at Mumbai airport on September 29, 2018, by immigration officials, later released and directed to contact the CBI on a particular mobile number.” They said he had not received any reply to a series of communications about his detention. He subsequently filed the petition. He submitted his reputation was at stake. “All that CBI could insist upon…was that it be informed about arrival/departure … in connection with his trips abroad,” the high court judgement said, noting that it was not even the Centre or CBI’s case, as argued by counsel Hiten Venegaonkar, that if he is permitted to leave the country it would be detrimental to the sovereignty, security or integrity of India or bilateral relations with any country or to the strategic or economic interests of India.” The CBI didn’t say any money was to be recovered from him either. Venegaonkar said that the Centre had cited a 2010 office memorandum and other circulars to say it was empowered to issue travel restrictions “particularly when it was suspected that he was involved in high value economic offences.” He said a lookout notice against Bhatt and other “high profile persons who were arraigned as accused” was issued in September 2018 to ensure that no one fled India in a bid to escape prosecution. He submitted that in March 2018, Bhatt was questioned but he had failed to give satisfactory answers in context of his actions to sanction loan facilities to Kingfisher Airlines, adding the case “involved huge economic loss to banks including SBI.”  The highc court in its judgment said it was “crucial” to see that the 2010 memorandum specifies taking recourse to look out circular in cognizable offences and that in the absence of any such offences, a person “cannot be detained or prevented from leaving the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-relief-for-ex-chairman-of-sbi-travel-restrictions-lifted/articleshow/81977798.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No police to man sealed societies, some corporators ask BMC to quarantine buildings||MUMBAI: On the day Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked states to focus on micro-containment zones, it is learnt that the BMC plan to get police to man entry gates of sealed buildings in the city is yet to get off the ground. Sealed buildings are treated as micro-containment zones. TOI visited various localities in the city and spoke to corporators on Thursday who said at times they themselves have to inform civic officials to seal a building or its floors with more than five Covid-19 cases. A civic circular, issued on April 5, stated police personnel deployed at the entry gates of buildings are to have control over who enters or leaves. “No egress shall be allowed, except with the concurrence of the secretary/chairman of the society and police deployed in each of these micro-containment zones, that too for exceptional cases only like medical emergencies and board exams of students,” the directive stated. Prakash Gangadhare, BJP corporator from Mulund, said this is not the case though. “There are several large housing complexes in Mulund but no police has been deployed anywhere. Besides, it is unrealistic to expect the police to man these housing societies at a time when cases are rising so rapidly. How many societies would they monitor?” Some corporators said as almost every society in the city has Covid cases at some point, they need to intimate the BMC to come and seal these. The rules state a society will be fined Rs 10,000 in the first instance of violation and Rs 20,000 thereafter. Pali Hill corporator Swapna Mhatre said many societies have become proactive with new rules giving powers to managing committees to seal flats with asymptomatic patients and also to put up boards at the gates denying visitors entry. At Kandivli’s 21-storey Whispering Palms XXclusive Co-operative Housing, for instance, resident Sameera Vakil said they have been sealing wings with over five positive cases since the beginning. “Luckily, we have cooperation from most society members,” she said, adding while one wing is sealed, there is no police deployment. BMC officials said they are in the process of writing to the police for deployment. “We assume the process may take time as they have to impose other restrictions in the city too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-police-to-man-sealed-societies-some-corporators-ask-bmc-to-quarantine-bldgs/articleshow/81975395.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Delhi||49% urban poor used unclean fuel in lockdown||New Delhi: Almost 36% of low-income housing groups in the capital are still reliant on unclean sources of fuel to cook, exposing them to high levels of indoor air pollution, a study carried out by city-based environmental NGO Chintan has found. The study, which was carried out in two survey phases, found the impact of the lockdown led to this figure to increasing to around 49%, owing to a reduction in income sources. The first data set on fuel use tracked 70 waste pickers in eight communities across Delhi during the lockdown and for five weeks following the end of the lockdown. Respondents were made to answer a range of questions related to work, income, food security and fuel usage. In the first week’s survey following the lockdown, respondents were asked what fuels they used for cooking in the pre-lockdown period and during the lockdown. In each weekly survey, they were asked what fuels were used to cook food in the previous week. The second data set drew from an ‘experiment’, where 61 waste picker households in two Delhi neighbourhoods (37 in Vivekananda Camp and 24 in Mulla Colony) were given LPG gas cylinders, while a ‘control’ group was set up to see the difference. The studies found overall, between 50 and 60% of respondents were using clean fuel for cooking. However, there was a shift towards the use of unclean fuels during the lockdown. “Before the lockdown, 36% of the respondents were using unclean fuels. After the lockdown however, 49% of the respondents have shifted either entirely or partly to using unclean fuels for cooking,” the survey said. The second survey revealed that less than a quarter (24%) of the households surveyed had already been using LPG for cooking prior to being provided gas cylinders through Chintan’s relief program. Households in both the experimental and control groups were equally as unlikely to have been already using LPG for cooking. Among respondents in the control group, 74% were using non-clean fuels only and 19% were using both. Only 7% were using LPG as the only cooking fuel source. “From this analysis, we can draw at least three conclusions. First, in the absence of provision of LPG, usage is low. Second, more than half of the respondents are exposed to high levels of indoor air pollution because of their complete reliance on unclean fuels. Third, shifts in fuel use are likely related to income as the drop in clean fuel use during the lockdown and return to clean fuel use in the post-lockdown period shows,” the study says, adding that only 44% of the cylinders provided by the NGO were re-filled again, with the remaining 56% stating they did not have adequate money for the same. Speaking on the findings during a webinar held by the NGO on Thursday, Shaily Jha, Research Analyst at CEEW said, “For the urban poor, they often have to pay money upfront to buy the cylinder, the subsidy money comes later in the bank which is often counter-productive for them. Hence people don't invest in LPG as a cooking fuel.” Bharati Chaturvedi, founder-director at Chintan, said indoor air pollution is an under-recognised killer, accounting for 33% of COPD deaths. “The poor say they can spend 400 rupees a month on cooking fuel. We must fill in the rest, whether via CSR or policy measures,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/49-urban-poor-used-unclean-fuel-in-lockdown/articleshow/81996090.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

The 10 companies of Punjab Police, while doing their duty, enjoyed the state’s coconut-fringed sandy beaches, immensely diverse cuisines and got along with the fishermen communities here. “One thing that we really enjoyed was fishing at sea. Some of us got up at 6am every day, left for Kovalam and after some fitness exercises, went with the fishermen and tried fishing with nets. I have never seen such a coordinated effort anywhere in the world,” said commandant of Punjab Police Kulwant Singh. The companies were deployed across Thiruvananthapuram city, Thiruvananthapuram rural, Kollam, and Alappuzha. After their daily election-related route march, the team took the opportunity to mingle with local communities and savour cuisines like fish fries, seasoned tapioca, puttu among other things. “We are not used to such kind of food in our place and this is our first trip to this part of the country,” he said. The companies also carried huge quantities of rations and provisions with them along with their own cooks. The team even hosted a Punjabi dinner for senior police officers in state. “Our daily meals are prepared by our cook. It is a practice deeply ingrained in our culture to host whoever is there with us,” he said. Team members visited several local attractions in the capital and other districts including Kovalam, Padmanabhaswamy Temple, and Jatayu earth centre. Several policemen felt that people here were more educated, friendly and full of empathy. “We are essentially trained fighters, but in Kerala, we feel that policing rarely requires the use of force as people are mostly law-abiding and the crime rate is comparatively low,” he said.  “They were cooperative and had fully adapted to the socio-political ambiance in state. They were of great help in maintaining peace during elections wherever they were deployed,” said ADGP (armed police battalion) K Padmakumar. The entire team was so touched by the hospitality and kindness of the people that members pooled some money and gave it to the school in Alappuzha where they had stayed. “When our school became their camp, they had promised that they wanted to do something in return. So they pooled an amount to get the school walls and the main gate repainted,” said Bindu T V, headmistress (in-charge) at GLPS, Kayamkulam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/punjab-police-team-gets-a-slice-of-local-life/articleshow/81975393.cms||KP Saikiran

According to the complainants M M Babu of Malayil Kalappurakkal house at Kundukad, P S George of Puthenveedu House at South Kondazhy, and K M Joy of Kalappurakkal House at Kundukad, they had booked tickets to travel from Wadakkanchery to Payyannur on October 9, 2013. As per the original schedule, the arrival time of the train at Wadakkanchery was 3.20am, and they had reached the station ahead of the scheduled time. The complainants alleged that there were announcements at the railway station stating the train would be late, but the railway authorities could not specify what time the train would finally arrive. Even after waiting for hours there was no specific information from the station authorities on the arrival of the train, forcing the complainants to explore alternative ways to travel. They proceeded to Shoranur to catch another train to Payyannur from there, advocate A D Benny, who appeared for the complainants said. The railway officials, however, submitted that the complaint was not bonafide, but for unjust enrichment and the late running of the train was due to “unavoidable operational reasons”. However, the forum president C T Sabu and the members K Radhakrishnan Nair and Sreeja S, in their order said, “In the absence of any contra evidence on the part of the opposite parties (Wadakkanchery railway station superintendent and senior divisional commercial manager, Palakkad) to establish that the late running was due to a genuine reason beyond the control of the Southern Railway officials or their subordinates, the commission has no other alternative, but to fix the blame of on the opposite parties alone.” The commission has directed the railway officials to pay Rs 5,000 each to the complainants as compensation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/consumer-forum-directs-rlys-to-pay-compensation-for-train-delay/articleshow/81975435.cms||T Ramavarman

The inscription was lying in Delhi Museum as a reserve collection. K Muniratnam Reddy, director, epigraphy branch, ASI Mysuru, said: “We have received a photograph of this inscription from the National Museum, Delhi. It is observed that this inscription from Nagarjunakonda remained unnoticed till now and is preserved in the reserve collection of the museum. It is written in Prakrit language and Brahmi characters of the second century AD. It seems to record the gift of Buddhapada”. The inscription reads, “Siddham Sakasa Modasa Bakanaya Budhaya Patapada Deyadhamma.” Nagarjunakonda was the seat of Ikshavaku dynasty that ruled Telugu land. The archaeological site, once a valley and now an island, is known for remains of ancient Buddhist monuments dated first to third century. Nagarjuna, the founder of Mahayana school of Buddhism, taught in the ancient university in Nagarjunakonda. Earlier, researchers found the tools belonging to the neolithic and palaeolithic age.

On March 1, the locals had staged a massive protest, which saw largescale violence, near the Gairsain assembly building. Residents of around 70 villages of the area had been protesting for the past several months in favour of their demand. Tharali legislator Munni Devi Shah met the CM on Thursday and apprised him of the problems being faced by the locals due to the single-lane road. Following this, the CM approved the project and directed the concerned authorities to start the work at the earliest. He told the officials of finance, planning and Public Works Department to coordinate and start the project. For a long period of time, the locals have been demanding the widening Ghat to Nandprayag road. Around four months back, former ex-CM Trivendra Singh Rawat had gone to the area and announced that the road widening work would commence soon. After waiting for around a month, the locals started protests and hunger strikes over the issue. The locals even formed a 19-km-long human chain during one of their protests. After their protests failed to draw any response from the authorities, around 2,000 locals staged a protest on March 1 – the first day of the budget session. The protest broke the barricading at Jungle Chatti – which is around 8-km from the assembly building at Bhararisain. Thereafter, another major protest was witnessed at Diwalikhal, which is 4-km before the assembly premises. The protest turned violent as some resorted to brick batting. Subsequently, the police had to resort to cane charge. Around 350 people, including 40 identified protestors, were booked for the violence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cm-approves-broadening-of-19-km-long-ghat-nandprayag-road/articleshow/81975419.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Delhi||251 plastic units asked for action plan on waste||New Delhi: Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has sought an extended producers responsibility (EPR) action plan under the Pastic Waste Management (amendment) Act from 251 industrial units that manufacture plastic bags. DPCC said if these units fail to submit an action plan within seven days, stringent action will be taken against them. Central Pollution Control Board has recently introduced standard operating procedures (SOPs) for registration of producers, importers and brand owners under the plastic waste management rules. A senior DPCC official said, “We have asked units to file EPR action plan according to SOPs of CPCB to avoid stringent action, including closure of defaulting units. We have also directed all 50 approved and redevelopment industrial areas to ask their member units coming in ambit of plastic waste management rules to apply for registration.” The official added all the civic bodies concerned have also been requested to furnish the details for setting up of infrastructure for segregation, collection, storage, transportation, processing and disposal of plastic waste to provide details of waste management agencies registered with the respective corporation to facilitate producer, importer and brand owners (PIBOs) to submit EPR action plan. According to the provision of amended plastic waste management rules, EPR for management of plastic waste packaging is entrusted with the PIBOs who introduce the products in the market. They are required to establish a system for management of plastic waste generated due to their products by engaging with local bodies. Local bodies are responsible for setting up of plastic waste management system with assistance from producers and brand owners. A DPCC official said, “We have been conducting a drive against producers, recyclers and manufacturers of plastic carry bags, which have been flouting the rules of plastic waste management. We have issued show-cause notices for closure to 19 industrial units since February this year for not having mandatory registration or manufacturing plastic bags with less than 50 microns thickness. Environmental damage compensation of Rs 13.2 lakh has also been imposed on them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/251-plastic-units-asked-for-action-plan-on-waste/articleshow/81996180.cms||---
---||Pune||This year, reserved Covid beds in Pune Metropolitan Region is down by half||PUNE: There are today fewer Covid beds at hospitals and care facilities in the Pune Metropolitan Region than what was available last year. In PMC limits, for example, a total of 8,176 beds have been set side this year for Covid patients - much less than the 14,352 beds reserved last year. Much of the bed shortage has been attributed to delayed government payments to private hospitals providing free or subsidised Covid care. Several hospitals, fearing losses, have been reluctant to reserve beds. Last year, the PMC had tied up with 11 private hospitals to provide free care. This year, the civic body has given payment assurances to only two private hospitals. The PCMC and the Pune rural administration too have reduced the number of beds. Officials said they have more ICU beds than last year, but have cut down on isolation beds at Covid care centres (CCCs) as many with mild symptoms are choosing to recover at home. They also said most patients this year - across the region - have been from the middle and upper-middle classes, compared to the scores of poor who were infected last year, necessitating the need for more isolation beds at care centres. PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar said, "Last year, the CCCs had most beds. This year, there are fewer CCCs as many patients in Pune have also opted for home isolation." The percentage of patients needing institutional isolation and hospitalisation was 60% during the September peak last year. This is now at 25% of all cases. "This year, 75% of all new patients are either asymptomatic or mildly infected. They are opting for home isolation," said Sanjeev Wavare, the PMC's nodal officer for Covid-19. Experts, however, said more need to be reserved across hospitals. Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital (DMH), which had the highest Covid admissions (435) in September, is already seeing a steady surge. "We currently have 325 admitted patients, including 50 in the ICUs. Unlike last year, higher numbers of smaller hospitals in Pune are now treating Covid, which has reduced the burden on the larger units. Despite that, we're still getting about 25 patients every day who need to be admitted," said Dhananjay Kelkar, the DMH's medical director. In Pimpri Chinchwad, healthcare activist Maruti Bhapkar said, "There were more beds during the slump last year than during this year's surge. When you call the helplines, the standard reply is 'there are no beds'." The PCMC had 5,327 beds reserved last year. The number is now down to 4,670. Officials from PCMC said they have increase the number of ventilator-supported ICU beds to 229. "Our Magar jumbo unit now has 400 beds. Overall availability will be increased soon," said Rajesh Patil, PCMC commissioner. Then there's the problem with the online dashboard that's supposed to show live bed availability. On April 7, the website showed the region had 22 available ICU beds with ventilators. But when TOI contacted hospitals, many said they were out of beds. The Criticare Hospital in Chakan showed six ICU beds on the dashboard. But a doctor at the hospital said all beds were occupied by April 6. "We had sent our updated bed information to authorities. We don't know why the dashboard is showing vacant beds at our units." Kamsheth Hospital, on April 7, didn't have a single ICU bed with a ventilator. But the dashboard showed it had five vacant beds. "We only have oxygen beds," a hospital representative said. The sub-district hospital, Manchar, had a contact number of an employee on the dashboard. But TOI found out the staffer had been transferred to Nagpur, with no other contact person listed for patients looking for beds.

Collector Rajesh Deshmukh confirmed the development to TOI over the phone.Other norms, such as testing workers every 15 days, remain the same, but Thursday’s decision comes as a massive relief to industries — especially micro, small and medium enterprises — which were worried about the high cost of conducting regular RT-PCR tests.“Industries would be allowed to use rapid antigen or RT-PCR tests. We made this decision after holding discussions with officials, including the chief secretary,” PCMC chief Patil said.Meanwhile, Patil and Kumar they have set up dedicated teams to field requests from companies that have offered their facilities for vaccination drives. Nodal officers would review the preparedness of each premises.“We would prefer premises that can accommodate at least 100 vaccinations per day,” PMC commissioner Kumar said. “There are some requirements under the standard operating procedure — separate rooms for waiting, vaccination and observation, and computer support for to enter and record date. We would also require staff to manage beneficiaries. If some companies have fewer than 100 employees, they can team up with nearby units and set up a vaccination facility,” he added.District authorities said they have already received several requests and expressed confidence about a smooth rollout, despite reports of vaccine shortage.“So far, 17 companies have expressed an interest in holding vaccination drives on their premises. They have existing medical facilities and tie-ups with hospitals. We hope to roll out vaccination at the workplace smoothly, and we are getting new stock of vaccines every three or four days,” Pune ZP CEO Ayush Prasad said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/companies-breathe-easy-as-antigen-tests-an-option-for-on-site-staffers/articleshow/81976603.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

On Thursday, the search and rescue teams recovered one more body from the main tunnel of the NTPC's Tapovan-Vishnugad hydro-power project, taking the total death toll to 78. "Two months after the flash floods, one more body was recovered from the main tunnel on Thursday. The rescue teams are working round the clock to remove the muck from the tunnel in which over 30 workers were initially believed to be trapped when the flash floods had hit the power plant," said Nand Kishore Joshi, disaster management officer, Chamoli. According to the state emergency operation centre, as many as 126 people are still reported to be missing and teams of National Disaster Response Force and State Disaster Response Force are continuing the search operation in the disaster-hit areas, including Raini village and areas around Tapovan barrage. The two expert panels formed by the National Disaster Management Authority to study the causes and the overall impact of the Chamoli floods, last week, visited Raini village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/chamoli-disaster-2-months-on-muck-removal-at-tapovan-tunnel-continues-78-bodies-found-so-far/articleshow/81975443.cms||Gaurav Talwar

Tripathi was convicted of being part of an unlawful assembly and obstructing public servants from doing their duty, but was discharged of rioting and other charges. Special judge Geetanjli Goel held that the prosecution had successfully proved Tripathi guilty beyond reasonable doubt under IPC Section 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions) read with IPC Section 149 (member of unlawful assembly). The judgment, however, noted, “He is convicted for the same, whereas he is acquitted of the offences under IPC sections 147 (rioting), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 333 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt to deter public servant from his duty) read with Section 149 IPC and Section 3 (1) of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984 read with Section 149 IPC.” Charges were framed against Tripathi and 17 others for rioting and obstructing Delhi Police from doing its duty, using criminal force on police, and voluntarily causing hurt to them, after the accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The court directed the accused to furnish affidavits of their assets and income within 10 days. The state was directed to furnish an affidavit of expenses incurred by the prosecuting agency within seven days as the case pertained to an MLA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-legislator-convicted-in-2013-case/articleshow/81996199.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In a letter to the dean of Sassoon hospital, the members said they are on the verge of suffering academic loss due to the tremendous workload. MARD general secretary Dnyaneshwar Jamkar said, “We have a training period of 3 years to become a competent specialist doctor. More than a third of that time has been spent working in Covid wards. If this continues, we are afraid we won’t have the necessary skills and competency by the end of our training period.” The statement issued by MARD stated, “Trainee doctors who have been at the frontline fighting the pandemic have received no exemption with regards to fees to be paid for the academic year. No exemption has been provided for thesis submission either, which is grossly unfair.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/trainee-resident-doctors-demand-good-quality-ppe-kits-fee-exemption/articleshow/81976605.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Far from madding crowd, 10 districts see only 7,000 to 23,000 cases||MUMBAI: In a state with more than 30 lakh Covid-19 cases and seven districts among the top 10 in India for active caseloads, there are still pockets where the coronavirus is not the biggest of problems. Unlike the city or Thane, where cases are in multiples of lakhs, these are patches where the pathogen has, for the most part, touched 10,000-20,000 persons so far. Coastal Ratnagiri district totalled under 13,500 cases at the beginning of the week. It is a district on the tourist map but could keep the virus under control even during the unlock phase because of its own thin population and, consequently, its ability to strictly implement the rules. Such districts have gained from a combination of less crowding and better, spread-out housing. “One of the reasons for the lower number of cases here is the very poor urbanisation and less movement of people,” Ratnagiri district collector Sanjay Shinde said. “Very few people from Mumbai or neighbouring districts are visiting.” Sindhudurg is another typical example of a place which, though not far from large urban centres, is characterised by low population density and independent housing units. Most live in a stand-alone dwelling on a small patch, unlike dwellers of semi-urban or industrial towns, who crowd together in poorly sanitised conditions. The state population is over 12 crore. The current Covid-19 tally of the state puts the average prevalence at over 2.5% of the population. In predominantly urban and crowded zones like Pune and Nagpur, 5%-10% of residents have been detected positive as the epidemic rapidly courses through neighbourhoods. But in remoter parts, the infection has run through barely 1% of the inhabitants. Reasons range broadly from poor connectivity and underdevelopment to better housing and low population density. The more poorly connected a district and the lower its importance to trade and industry, greater the probability of the pandemic blowing past it. Tribal Gondia, Gadchiroli and Nandurbar, and dry, interior Marathwada districts of Hingoli and Parbhani fall in this category. Gadchiroli collector Deepak Singal said the urban population was small there, and even hamlets were far from one another. “There is no movement of people from neighbouring districts,” he said. Hingoli collector Ruchesh Jaiwanshi said cases there began to rise only with the recent gram panchayat polls. The other districts among the best 10 in checking the spread of the virus are Washim, Wardha and Bhandara, all largely rural landscapes. “Urbanisation is less here and, as a result, movement of people is very low,” Satish Pawar, additional director of health services, said. “Population is very poor, distances between villages large, and so social gatherings few. There are no major industries.” Some districts have also been affected by the neglect of the administration, resulting in inadequate resources for detection and testing. The low number of tests done in these places is believed to have added to the impression that they are in some ways shielded from the pathogen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-far-from-madding-crowd-10-districts-see-only-7000-to-23000-cases/articleshow/81977855.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

The green signal has now paved the way for expeditious setting up of the apex statutory entity under the amended Motor Vehicles Act. Currently, the road transport ministry has a small unit of officials who deal with road safety issues in addition to other responsibilities. There are hardly any exclusive professionals to carry out research and studies to identify the problems. Though the board will be an advisory body, it will play a crucial role as it will have technical committees to look into different aspects of safety, ranging from civil engineering to vehicle construction and standards, suggesting recall of motor vehicles and safety equipment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/finmin-clears-proposal-for-national-road-safety-board/articleshow/81979392.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Shiv Sena minister couldn’t have done any wrong: Sanjay Raut||MUMBAI: A day after arrested police officer Sachin Waze claimed in a letter addressed to the NIA court that Shiv Sena minister Anil Parab had asked him to get a trust to do a “Rs 50 crore settlement” and collect “Rs 2 crore” from BMC contractors, Sena MP and the party’s chief chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut defended the minister, saying Parab could not indulge in wrongdoing. Without naming the opposition BJP, Raut said “dirty politics is being played” and attempts being made to weaken and destabilise the Maha Vikas Aghadi government. However, he said there was no threat to the government. Parab has denied all the allegations and said as a loyal Sainik of the late Balasaheb Thackeray, he could not do what Waze had alleged. Raut told mediapersons on Thursday that Parab was “a hardcore Shiv Sainik and he will not swear wrongly in the name of Balasaheb Thackeray, nor would he indulge in any wrongdoing.” The allegations were “a political conspiracy against the Sena minister and the state government,” Raut claimed. “If someone tried to play games and put the Maharashtra government into trouble with a ‘prompted’ letter, such an attempt would not be successful,” Raut further said. Indicating that the BJP was behind Waze’s letter, Raut stated, “No need to tell who is behind it.” Parab, who is transport minister, is known to be a close aide of CM Uddhav Thackeray. As an advocate, most legal issues are handled by him. Parab had also prepared CM Thackeray’s affidavits submitted to the election office when he filed his nomination for the legislature council member and Aaditya Thackeray’s affidavit when he contested the assembly polls from Worli in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sena-minister-couldnt-have-done-any-wrong-says-raut/articleshow/81977898.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Nagpur||Thackeray playing politics over vaccines shortage: Fadnavis||Nagpur: Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday accused the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of playing politics over vaccine shortage, to divert attention away from its own failures in handling the Covid-19 situation. “Look at the precarious situation in a state where patients aren’t getting ventilators, oxygenated beds, and even simple beds in government and private hospitals. There’s a massive shortage of Remdesivir and other essential medicines. All these factors aren’t in the hands of the Centre. Basically, this government has failed to fulfil its responsibility of providing basic services. None of the MVA ministers are talking about these issues,” Fadnavis said after his arrival at the city airport. Flaying MVA ministers, the LOP said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and his team need to pay attention to providing basic services, but instead they are blaming Centre for not supplying vaccines. Defending Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, the former CM said he told him that only three states received over one crore vaccines — Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan. “Gujarat and Rajasthan have the same population. Vaccines are supplied not on the basis of population, but on the basis of states’ vaccination performance. Maharashtra received 1.06 crore vaccines. The DGIPR in a tweet on April 6 mentioned 91 lakh vials were used, which means 15 lakh are still left.” The South-West Nagpur MLA questioned the government’s move to spread fake news about vaccine shortage and deliberately shutting down centres. “Vaccines would continue to be supplied by the Centre from April 9 to 12, where Maharashtra will again get 19 lakh vaccines. Despite having double the population than Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh was provided 92 lakh vaccines. The health minister assured me there will be no discrimination against Maharashtra. Even NCP supremo Sharad Pawar had a talk with Dr Harsh Vardhan and the latter apprised him of the situation.” Centre must stop playing with people’s lives in Maha: Malik Terming Fadnavis’ allegations ‘baseless’, minority affairs minister and NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said the Centre was meting out step-motherly treatment to Maharashtra to harass the MVA government. “We’re doing the highest vaccination of over seven lakh persons per day. Still, we aren’t provided required doses. On the other hand, UP was given 40 lakh, Haryana 24 lakh, and Gujarat 30 lakh doses.” He added that MVA had also sought permission to produce vaccines at Haffkins, but even that was denied. “In a few days, all private vaccination centres would stop inoculation, as their stocks have exhausted. We want to cover over 3.5 crore people in state and, therefore,we should have been provided 10 lakh vaccines per day. The Centre must stop playing with people’s lives in Maharashtra just to play politics with MVA government,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/thackeray-playing-politics-over-vaccines-shortage-fadnavis/articleshow/81976613.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Pune||Little or no use of remdesivir on critical Covid patients: Experts||Pune: Antiviral drug remdesivir has little or no impact on critical Covid patients and should be used only for the mild to moderately ill, experts have said. “Remdesivir should not be used as a routine treatment for critically ill Covid-19 patients. It is an antiviral drug and can benefit only carefully selected patients in mild to moderate stage,” said critical care expert Kapil Zirpe, chief intensivist, Ruby Hall Clinic. Halting the drug’s rampant and irrational use among non-indicated patients is the surest way to address the ongoing shortage, the experts said, considering many small- and medium-sized hospitals in Pune are reeling under a severe shortage of the drug. “In light of the new interim data from the WHO’s solidarity trial, remdesivir is now classified as a drug you should not use routinely in Covid-19 patients. It benefits those patients who are hypoxic (blood oxygen saturation below 94) or has inducible hypoxia (oxygen saturation dropping not at rest but after the walk) after three or six minutes walk,” Zirpe said. Remdesivir has potential side effects on the kidneys. “The drug should be used when a Covid patient has persistent fever/cough with chest CT score touching 12 or above. It can also be used for those who are either hypoxia or have inducible hypoxia with other pre-existing illnesses,” Zirpe said. The drug was initially used in severest patients with minimal positive response. Later, it was used in moderate illness with a better outcome. Steriods are now a standard part of the regimen given along with remdesivir. “Remdesivir kills the virus and decreases its load. Steroids douse the fire initiated by the virus. Therefore, it is logical to extend the use of remdesivir during the early stages to prevent occurring of inflammation. Not much benefit has been seen when this drug is given to critically ill patients,” said Subhal Dixit, chief intensivist, Sanjeevan Hospital. Critical care expert Kapil Borawake, director ICU, Vishwaraj hospital, said, “The drug is now being used in patients with minimal or inducible hypoxia when the fever does not respond or, when, on CT scan, we find abnormalities or people have significant comorbidities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/little-or-no-use-of-remdesivir-on-critical-covid-patients-experts/articleshow/81976659.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Popular among locals, the state government had been trying for a long time to boost tourism in the area with an Amarnath-like yatra. However, pilgrims faced challenges in reaching the spot as the area fell under the inner line limit (measured from the international border to the ITBP or Army post) due to its proximity to the Tibet border and thus, the visitors required special permission from the district authorities.

CBI registered three cases against the firms on complaints of Union Bank of India in 2019, and during investigations found the involvement of the two. CBI alleged that then DGM (regional head) Ashok Dhabai and GM (zonal head) Sanjay Sharma helped the companies to avail of credit based on forged documents.CBI said the companies’ directors, with the help of financial consultants and “paper companies” created fake documents. Officials said the bank extended credit letters to the companies without mortgages. The two had granted credit facilities without processing, appraisal, assessment and internal ratings. The first case was registered in June 2019 against Supama Trading Pvt Ltd along with its promoters Vijay Jain, Dilip Shah and Bajrang Kankani. They defrauded Rs 57 crore of credit facilities. In the second case, Dhabai and Sharma helped Asuti Trading Pvt Ltd’s promoters Siddharth Madanlal and Raj Goel defraud the bank of Rs 50 crore. In the third, Excel Metal Processor Pvt Ltd’s promoters Mohammad Iqbal Khan and Imran Khan defrauded Rs 43 crore. CBI stated that the companies created fake suppliers and submitted fabricated tax invoices, bills of exchange and forged lorry receipts to the bank to get LC discounting (a short-term credit facility). CBI stated that the promoters of the companies made employees directors in “paper companies” created for generating fabricated tax invoices to defraud the bank. Dabhai was also among the bank’s officials named in a first information report filed by the CBI in 2017 for allegedly allowing cash deposits of about Rs 85 crore after announcement of demonetisation in violation of norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cbi-chargesheets-two-bank-staffers-for-rs-150-crore-fraud-in-mumbai/articleshow/81977931.cms||Vijay V Singh

From cab drivers who can’t apply for passes to factory owners running night shifts and shops that restock at night, there are many exasperated groups. TimesViewAllowing night vaccination while imposing a night curfew seems illogical. The issue can only be sorted out if the process of issuing e-passes is streamlined. The matter must be resolved fast to ensure that the hapless citizen doesn’t suffer for conflicting administrative decisions.Naveen Gupta, general secretary, All India Motor Transport Association, claimed to have filed applications for three transporters only to have them turned down. “Almost all the work of goods transportation, loading and unloading happens during the night, but truckers are not getting e-passes,” he grumbled. “To maintain the supply chain, we need the labourers, drivers and office staff working at odd hours. The night curbs should have been thought through.” Kamaljeet Gill, representative of the cab aggregator drivers’ unions, pointed out that e-passes are not issued to taxi drivers, only to passengers. “If someone wants to go from Noida or Gurgaon to Delhi, how will the taxi drivers deal with restrictions?” Gill asked. Robin Dabas similarly pointed out the problem being faced by food delivery agents after 10pm. “Food delivery agents cannot apply for e-passes because they don’t have a specific office address. They work everywhere via online platforms, but the people enforcing the curfew haven’t been made aware of this,” Dabas said. In Delhi, shopkeepers need passes to be able to oversee the unloading of goods at night. “My stock arrives early in the morning or late at night, so I need a pass,” said Ashok Randhawa, president, Mini Market Association, Sarojini Nagar. “It’s been two days since I applied, but there’s no response. The website showed my application as accepted, but since then there is neither an update nor has my application status changed.” At Sadar Bazar, it was a problem the shop owners had to sort out with the cops. Rakesh Yadav, president, Federation of Sadar Bazar Traders Associations, “Since transporters were facing problems in deploying staff at night, we met police officers during which we asked for traders to be allowed to apply for passes for select employees or ensure alternative arrangements,” he disclosed.

Dheeraj of Raj Nagar in west Delhi has been trying to get a pass since April 6. “I have some medical problems, having recently undergone heart bypass surgery. But I have been unable to get the e-pass,” he tweeted. Many like him, many others too have been left frustrated. Vansh Madan of Faridabad said that he had to drive to UP via Delhi for the cremation of a relative, but was unable to generate the e-pass because the application required a Delhi address. “The portal only accepts Delhi addresses, but I am a Faridabad resident.

Realtor Mettu Narsimhulu and driver of the earth mover Ravi were in for a pleasant surprise when they found a pot full of golden and silver ornaments. Several earrings, nose beads and other golden ornaments were found in the pot. Jangaon additional collector Bhaskar, tahasildar Ravinder, assistant commissioner of police Vinod Kumar and other officials arrived at the spot and examined the ornaments. The tahasildar conducted a panchanama and seized the pot in the presence of witnesses. “We examined the treasure pot and found gold and silver ornaments. According to the bullion experts the silver ornaments weighed about 1.7 kg while gold is 189 grams,” said Ravinder. The state director and staff of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) visited Pembarthy and they decided to deposit the ornaments with the Warangal Urban district treasury. Media was not allowed to meet the ASI members and a district officer said that ASI will reveal the historical details of the ornaments after a thorough examination. Realtor Narsimhulu from Bhogaram village Medchal-Malkajgiri district brought 11 acres of land. Interestingly, a woman, whose sons sold the land to Narasimhulu alleged that many treasure pots may have been found in the land. “My four sons Yellaiah, Narsaiah, Parashuramulu and Praveen sold the entire land to the realtor.

---||Pune||Pune gets only 14% of state’s remdesivir share, daily demand up to 11,000 vials||Pune: The state government has allotted the district only 14% of the share of remdesivir vials it gets primarily from four pharma companies amid the spiralling shortage of the drug in Pune, top health officials confirmed. Besides low allocation, rampant and irrational use of the drug at private hospitals was one of the reasons for the growing shortage of the drug in the city, the officials stressed. Currently, the state gets 45,000 vials of the intravenous drug. Among them, Pune gets 6,300 vials (14%) when the district’s daily requirement has gone up to 11,000 vials every day. “Only four pharma companies — Hetero, Cipla, Mylan, and Jubilant — are currently providing the drug according to their production to the Maharashtra government. The government, in turn, allocates the drug to every district according to the number of hospitalised patients in their jurisdiction,” said a health official, requesting anonymity. The reason for low allocation lies in the state’s calculation of the daily requirement. “According to the state government’s calculation, only 50% admitted patients require remdesivir but, 80% of the hospitalised patients at private hospitals in Pune are being prescribed it, which is a matter of concern. Whereas the drug is given rationally at government-run hospitals,” said S B Patil, joint commissioner (drugs), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pune. Commenting on irrational use of the drug, Patil said, “The drug is given even to Covid patients with chest computed tomography (CT) score of 2 with no other clinical symptoms, which is not at all an indication of using the drug. The drug has to be given to moderately ill patients so that they do not progress to severe illness.” Senior medical expert Siddharth Dhende, who runs a small hospital at Nagpur Chawl in Yerawada, said, “Small hospitals are completely left out in the vial allocation. How I am supposed to treat my hypoxic patients? It is the responsibility of the FDA to ensure smooth allocation across all hospitals, big and small.” Sanjay Patil, the chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India, said, “Big hospitals are mainly stocking up the vials in a large number. That is also one of the reasons why small hospitals are compelled to look out for the drug. Patients’ relatives are running from pillar to post owing to the low allocation and mismanagement.” Anticipating a tripling of demand for remdesivir by the end of the month, public health minister Rajesh Tope urged the pharmaceutical companies to rapidly ramp up their production. The minister held a meeting on Thursday with senior executives of seven companies producing the injection. Tope said flying squads must be appointed in each district to prevent its unnecessary use. “Its MRP should be reduced as well to prevent profiteering,” he said. The Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner, Rajesh Patil, on Thursday issued showcause notices to the three private hospitals for inflating the prices of Remdesivir on Thursday. The hospitals’ representatives have been told to reply to the notice within 48 hours.

This, and various other facts, were revealed during the virtual town hall on waste management held on Thursday. Organised by Climate Voices in association with state’s environment and climate change department, the town hall was hosted by NGO Waatavaran Foundation with an aim of obtaining recommendations on solid waste management solutions. Data presented during the talk showed that a total of 84 lakh tonnes of municipal solid waste was generated in 2019-20 while 22,945 tonnes is being generated across the state daily. “Of the daily waste generated, 22,685 tonnes or 98.7% was being collected and 15,980 tonnes or 70% was being scientifically treated. The total figure for waste being scientifically treated has touched 80% in 2021,” said Nandkumar Gurav, Regional Officer (Headquarters) at MPCB. The state also generated 4.4 tonnes of plastic waste, of which 88% was collected while 61% was channelized for recycling and use. “We are finding it very difficult to audit waste generation and need a common platform to address this, and this is a key recommendation from MPCB to be included in the State Climate Action Plan,” added Gurav. Maharashtra has been annually reporting the highest quantity of waste among all states for the past five years, According to the government, funds and detailed plans are in place and what is needed is a strong administrative will to achieve highest waste management standards. Manisha Mhaiskar, principal secretary of state environment and climate change department, said, “The administrations from towns and cities should engage with the community. We have sufficient funds as well as plans and now all we need is will for implementation.” Mhaiskar also added that all the recommendations received in the town hall will be put together as a climate action agenda and submitted to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and environment minister Aaditya Thackeray on June 5 (World Environment Day). During the discussions, Leena Buddhe, director of Centre for Sustainable Development, highlighted waste management challenges in Nagpur. “The residents feel that all their efforts in segregating waste is going waste as all types of garbage is collected in one vehicle. Also, there is no plan in place for door-to-door waste collection in slums,” she said. The expert added that collection system for sanitary and household bio-medical waste also remains missing. “Door-to-door waste collection needs to be more effective. Decentralised waste management must be thought about and implemented,” she said.

Many citizens have in the past few days taken to the social media demanding an increase in Covaxin centres in Pune because their second doses were due. These citizens claimed that they had been unable to find the Covaxin centres.As on April 7, there were 45 Covaxin centres in Pune district. In comparison, 346 centres in the district were administering Covishield. On April 8, the number of Covaxin centres in the district dropped to 10.A couple of days ago, Pune district got around 78,500 Covaxin doses and Mumbai over 37,000. Aurangabad was provided with over 34,700 doses for second shots, while Latur and Nashik’s shares were over 30,700 and 33,200, respectively. This assumes significance particularly for Pune because little less than a month ago, many vaccination centres in the district began inoculating beneficiaries with the first doses of Covaxin. Health department estimates indicate that nearly 19,500 beneficiaries had received the first shots of Covaxin on March 16 and 17. Their second doses are due during the next few days. A senior district health department official said, “There aren’t too many Covaxin beneficiaries in the district who need the second dose. There is no requirement of increasing the session sites for the Covaxin second doses. Covaxin was administered on around 1.5 lakh beneficiaries (first doses) in Pune district around mid-March. The existing number of Covaxin centres will be sufficient for their second doses."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/citizens-awaiting-covaxin-2nd-shot-fret-over-few-sites/articleshow/81976679.cms||Neha Madaan

Pune Zilla Parishad (ZP) chief executive officer Ayush Prasad said the only reason for a clean record in these gram panchayats had been following Covid-appropriate behaviour.There are about 1,176 villages spread across twelve talukas in the district. The 229 villages account for one-sixth of the total villages or 16.29 % of the total number of villages in Pune district.Prasad told TOI, “It is not as if the Pune rural administration has not conducted tests or there has not been any surveillance in these villages. Everything that was being done in towns was also done at the villages and is still being implemented. These villages are still under observation and appropriate steps would be taken but, as of April 7, there have been 229 villages in the district without a single case ever since the pandemic struck the nation.”Talukas like Purandar, Daund and Khed have seen maximum villages with zero cases. Prasad said that just like other places in Pune and outside there were a large number of migrant workers, who had travelled to their villages from Mumbai during the lockdown. “What worked was the 639 village quarantine centres that were set up by the administration to manage the inflow of migrant workers and timely observation among them,” added Prasad.The administration also attributed the success to the hard work by ASHA workers and teachers since they went door-to-door for temperature and symptoms check, record-keeping by volunteers and constant follow-ups with villagers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/229-gram-panchayats-in-dist-report-zero-covid-19-cases/articleshow/81976693.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Sources said NIA could call Sharma again for questioning if the need arises. The NIA has so far arrested 3 persons: assistant police inspector Sachin Waze, murder convict constable Vinayak Shinde and Gujarat-based bookie Naresh Gor. Sharma arrived at the NIA’s Pedder Road office at around 11 am on Thursday and left at around 10.20 pm. NIA wanted to examine his mobile phone, but there was no confirmation if it had seized it. Sharma has denied his involvement. “We were not satisfied with Sharma’s questioning and hence he was asked to again join the probe. All those connected with the case who have been questioned earlier will be called again,” said a source. NIA is probing how Waze arranged the gelatin sticks. NIA wants to know who procured the gelatin sticks, how and from where. Sharma was asked about his presence at the police headquarters and his meeting with Waze on March 2. The same day, Waze asked Hiran to meet a lawyer and draft a complaint letter alleging harassment by police and media. Shinde was an accused along with Sharma in the fake encounter of Lakhan Bhaiya in 2006. Sharma was the only accused acquitted in that case. Waze was in Sharma’s team in 2004 when the custodial death of 2002 terror suspect Khwaja Yunus happened. Waze was under suspension for 17 years. NIA on Thursday took Waze to JJ Hospital for a check-up as he complained of chest pain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nia-quizzes-encounter-cop-for-over-11-hrs-on-2nd-day-running/articleshow/81977957.cms||Mateen Hafeez

---||Nagpur||Covid-19: Deaths of ‘others’ pushing up death toll in Nagpur district||NAGPUR: Of the 5,573 Covid19 deaths recorded in Nagpur till Thursday, 893 are of people not residents of Nagpur district. This is more than 16% of the total death toll. Deaths listed under the ‘other’ category has pushed up the case fatality rate to 2.14%. Minus the other patients, it would have been 1.80%. Moreover, the fatality rate of such patients is more than 83%. More alarming is that 90% of them died the day they reached Nagpur or within 48 hours of their admission. Who are the ‘others’? Patients referred in a critical condition from neighbouring states and even other parts of Maharashtra who test positive for Covid-19 after coming to Nagpur are counted in this category. Being a medical hub of central India, Nagpur receives patients not only from entire Vidarbha and Marathwada region, but also from adjacent states of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. A large number of patients come to Nagpur from MP and Chhattisgarh every day. As per official data, 1,075 such patients have been reported in Nagpur so far — less than 0.5% of the total 2.59 lakh cases in the district. Significantly, 893 of them have not survived. The data conveys that the other patients are brought in a serious condition and die during treatment. Doctors who have been treating such patients said that they either get infected during treatment or already have the Covid-19 infection but are reaching untested to the city. “Being a tertiary healthcare centre, GMCH receives hundreds of patients from neighbouring states everyday,” said Dr Avinash Gawande, the medical superintendent. According to Dr Gawande, many come in very critical condition after being referred to Nagpur by the local private or government hospitals. As per protocol, their Covid-19 test is done here. Mayo Hospital also receives many patients from MP and Chhattisgarh. Many private and trust-run hospitals are also admitting a large number of patients from across the Central India region. A leading heart specialist from Nagpur, who is also a director of a private multi-speciality hospital said that patients avoid Covid-19 tests in their home state. “Many patients from MP and Chhattisgarh reach Nagpur for treatment of non-Covid ailments. On coming to Nagpur, we conduct their Covid-19 test. Most of them test positive. Testing is not followed in neighbouring states as strictly as in Maharashtra,” he said. As these patients avoid Covid-19 tests, they don’t get medication and treatment for the virus in their home districts. As a result, they are already in a serious condition on reaching Nagpur making it very difficult for the doctors to provide treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/deaths-of-others-pushing-up-death-toll-in-nagpur-district/articleshow/81976736.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The new rules and regulations for teacher transfer policy have been announced by the education department. Teachers can have a preference of 30 schools while filing the transfer forms, while teacher couples will be appointed in schools within 30km. After the transfer, the teachers will also eligible for paid maternity leave and for nursing and serious accidents. Many are apprehensive about the transfers to be effected this year with the current Covid situation in the state. A government school teacher said, “In the past three years, the appropriation of teacher posts has not been done. In these three years, the student enrolment has either reduced or improved. Hence, the state government will have to once again conduct the process of appropriation with respect to student-teacher ratio and other parameters before effecting the transfers.”The transfer process will be conducted online and teachers said even if the process would save time, the officers working for the transfer process last time have either retired or they have been assigned other jobs. In their absence, having a new team completely will pose a big challenge to complete the process by May 31, which is nearly 50 days away.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/teacher-transfer-policy-rules-say-only-5-yrs-in-one-school/articleshow/81976721.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

At that time Kerala was reporting around 4,000-5,000 new cases/day. Rest of India’s percentage share in new Covid cases was 32%. By March 1, new cases from Kerala began to drop further. India on March 1, reported 12,270 new cases and Kerala’s share dropped to 27%, while Maharashtra’s jumped to 68%. Rest of India only contributed 6% of the total Covid cases. By April 1, the scenario changed completely with India seeing a surge in Covid cases– 72,113 new cases in a day. Of these, 55% cases were reported from Maharashtra and 41% from the rest of India. Kerala’s new Covid case percentage share dropped to 4 with 2,000 to 2,700 new cases being reported in a day. “How did Kerala turn around the Covid situation in a span of 8-10 weeks amid a fiercely fought assembly election? Aggressive ramping up of testing and vaccination has ensured that Kerala was able to reduce its month-on-month mortality moving growth rate (MGR) as well as Covid cases,” said Mysore Sanjeev, convener, Project Jeevan Raksha that came out with monthly projections for each state during the initial months of the first Covid wave. “Stringent guidelines, early detection of cases and quick quarantine have helped control the spread of infection in the state. HCWs and the state's people have played a major role besides government. At no point our hospitals were overburdened with Covid patients,” said Dr PK Jameela, former director, directorate of health services. But, she said that the post-election Covid scenario is a concern and the state is already taking stringent measures to control the spread of the infection, even as the rest of India is hit by a second wave. “As per sero-surveillance, Kerala hasn’t missed many cases. Continued Covid appropriate behaviour among people has ensured that the spread of infection from one person to another is low,” said internal medicine expert Dr Arun NM, who has been analysing Covid death trend in Kerala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-follows-a-different-covid-trajectory-yet-again/articleshow/81975494.cms||Preetu Nair

The incident was reported from Islamnagar area of Budaun district on Wednesday. His two friends suffered injuries in the accident. The victim, Shoeb, 17, who rode pillion, had left home along with his college friends Aman and Armaan in the afternoon. In the evening, an anonymous caller informed Shoeb’s father Akhtar about the accident. Soon, the trio's relatives rushed to the spot and shifted them to a hospital. Shoeb, however, succumbed to the injuries he had suffered on his head within a few minutes of the treatment, said police. Islamnagar police station SHO Bachchu Singh told TOI, “The family had shifted the victim to a hospital before we reached the spot. Later, we came to know that one of the boys had died. The other two are stable. Since there was no other vehicle involved in the accident, no complaint was lodged. The family refused a post-mortem examination and buried Shoeb. We will register a complaint against the person riding the bike for rash driving and damaging public property as per the law.” “We came to know that the boys were making videos on the moving bike. But, we have so far not found a photo or a video clip.

She will address the public meeting at Pavilion Grounds at 5.15 pm. Sharmila’s mother YS Vijayamma is expected to be present at Friday’s public meeting. Sharmila’s team has chalked out a route map from her Lotus Pond residence to Khammam. She is expected to go in a large convoy of vehicles. En route, there will be small public gatherings at Hayathnagar, Choutuppal, Nakrekal, Suryapet, Namavaram and Nayakangudem before the convoy reaches Pavilion Grounds. The meeting at Khammam with her supporters will be the first wherein Sharmila will address a public gathering and not a closed-door meeting. Her supporters from all the districts are set to take part in the meeting. Till now, Sharmila has conducted meetings with her supporters from nine erstwhile districts at her Lotus Pond residence. Meanwhile, Khammam police have given permission for the public meeting, but sent a letter on April 6 asking the meeting organisers to strictly adhere to Covid-19 norms. “We will follow Covid-19 guidelines,” Sharmila’s aide Konda Raghava Reddy said. “However, if the ruling party leaders try to pose hurdles to the meeting, we won’t make it easy for them. Some ruling party leaders are already apprehensive about the emergence of Sharmila and her new political party,” Raghava Reddy said. No dispute in the family, says mother YS Vijayamma wrote an open letter to the public the other day seeking their blessings for her daughter. “As the daughter-in-law of Telangana, Sharmila feels her political path is in Telangana. This is what she is pursuing,” Vijayamma said in the letter. She also explained that her son, Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy wants cordial relations with all neighbouring states in order to take AP forward. She said there were no differences between Jagan and Sharmila. Jagan’s YSRCP has so far stayed away from active politics in Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sharmila-public-meeting-in-t-today-mom-likely-to-attend/articleshow/81976833.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

---||Kolkata||Colleagues, not opponents, bigger worry for TMC’s Javed||Kolkata: Kasba assembly constituency might pose a serious challenge to the present incumbent, say political observers, pointing at reasons, including the lack of coordination between Trinamool candidate Javed Ahmed Khan and a section of the party’s block and ward-level leaders, who could make or mar the minister’s poll prospect. A senior Trinamool leader in south Kolkata conceded the two-time MLA was more worried about “anti-party activities” of some of his colleagues in no less than three KMC wards than his rival Left Front councillors, who were in control of two wards under Kasba constituency. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, he had managed to ensure a marginal lead from those two Left-dominated wards (91, 92) for Trinamool’s South Kolkata parliamentary constituency candidate Mala Roy. “Khan would have lost the 2016 elections had he failed to bag 28,000 votes from Ward 66, where his son, Faiz Ahmed Khan, is a councillor. Khan had trailed from two wards, where two Trinamool councillors were expected to play a major role in ensuring votes for the candidate,” the Trinamool leader said. Of the six KMC wards—(66, 67, 91, 92, 107 & 108)—in Kasba assembly constituency, Khan is reportedly concentrating on four wards that might give him clear lead. “We have changed our election plan. We are taking a foolproof strategy and carefully choosing our polling agents so that no damage is done to our poll prospect by any untoward incidents,” said Faiz. The infighting in certain wards notwithstanding, the Trinamool seemed assured of an intact vote bank in Ward 66, as was evident from reactions of the electorate. Ajay Bharti, a businessman and a resident of Picnic Garden Road, said Khan would take a comfortable lead from the area, as he did in 2016. Apart from pointing at the infighting within Trinamool’s rank and file, Satarup Ghosh, the United Force-supported CPM candidate, has been campaigning against the current incumbent’s failure in uplifting Bengal in all spheres as well as against BJP’s divisive politics. “We need to unite to avert the twin dangers of communalism and corruption that may tear the society apart. We need to be aware of these twin dangers and exercise our franchise accordingly,” Ghosh urged voters across Kasba. But oncologist Indranil Khan, who will contest the Kasba seat on a BJP ticket, claimed residents were politically aware and could unmask CPM leaders, who had themselves “joined hands with communal forces but accused the BJP of playing communal cards”. People would reject Trinamool from Kasba as its leaders were engaged in rampant corruption and ran syndicates, Khan said. “Only BJP can guarantee a corruption-free, steady and progressive government in Bengal,” he said. A section of BJP leaders in Kasba, however, conceded that compared to CPM or Trinamool, the party in the constituency lacked an effective election machinery that could ensure genuine votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/colleagues-not-opponents-bigger-worry-for-tmcs-javed/articleshow/81976787.cms||Saikat Ray

---||Kolkata||Poll season glare on Chinatown problems||Kolkata: While an  holds new promises for some, it also comes with a grim reminder of years of disappointment for some others. The Chinese in Kolkata, who have adopted the city as their home for generations, claim discrimination, lack of opportunities and neglect from governments of all colours were the reasons behind the unfulfilled dream of the community’s integration with the rest of the population. Absence of employment or favourable policies for the youth had forced the younger generations to move out of the city and even country for better life, they pointed out. A steady exodus in the past few decades has shrunk the community size from 1,00,000-1,20,000 in the 1950s to merely 2,000-2,500 now. “The Chinese youths are getting good opportunities in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the US and UAE. In India, there is hardly employment and business opportunities for Indians. We Chinese don’t stand much chance. It is painful for us to see our children leave but we can’t deny them a better life,” said Liu Yan Chen (68), a member of Tangra Welfare Society. Tangra—one of the oldest Chinatowns in the world—which falls in the Kasba constituency, will vote on Saturday. “I will cast my vote like always. The civic infrastructure has improved, and the neighbourhood is more secure now. But these are basics and our children need favourable policies and better opportunities,” said Chen. In the 1770s, Chinese merchants from Guangdong Province settled down in Kolkata and set up sugar plantations on land granted by the East India Company. Kolkata’s Chinese population surged in the 1940s and 50s as affluent Hakka immigrants acquired and built tanneries in Tangra. Chinatown came up around the tanneries and gradually grew into an integral part of the city, offering the best restaurants in town. The tanneries, which once lined the “township”, have since been moved to Bantala and luxurious condos have come up in those places. Chinese faces are fast disappearing at the markets, tea-shops and clubs in the neighbourhood but politicians keep trying to woo the community as is evident from the graffiti in Chinese. In the early ’60s, several Chinese were taken to prison in Deoli, Rajasthan, on suspicion of being spies after the India-China war. Monica Liu, the “Mandarin matriarch” and owner of popular eateries, was a child at that time. “The fear of a repetition of such accusations started off the exodus,” said Liu, who have stayed back. But her children and grandchildren have all migrated. “We have to think about our security, too,” said Chu Yu Ming, a beautician in Tangra, remembering the discontent against the Chinese in Kolkata after border skirmishes between India and China in Ladakh’s Galwan valley last year. Chen at times dreams of working on a museum, showcasing Chinese history and their contribution to the city. “But I change my mind. If there is no effort from the authorities for the people, who will look after the museum?” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/poll-season-glare-on-chinatown-problems/articleshow/81976844.cms||Zeeshan Javed

---||Mumbai||Vax shortage: Over 40% of Mumbai centres cancel today’s program||MUMBAI: The vaccine shortage turned acute on Thursday, with 25 of the 71 private centres in the city unable to inoculate a single person. After Thursday’s drive, the city is left with 40,000 to 50,000 doses, barely enough to last a day. As a result, at least 51 of the total 120 centres, including public ones, have cancelled their drives for Friday, according to BMC. Some major public centres like BKC Jumbo, SevenHills Hospital, Dahisar jumbo, Cooper Hospital, Kasturba Hospital and VN Desai have either cancelled or trimmed their drive for Friday. On Thursday, some big centres saw unprecedented rush as word of the shortage spread. Crowds at SevenHills Hospital in Andheri spilled out to the compound and the Nesco jumbo vaccination centre saw serpentine queues. Local corporators were flooded with calls from panicky people, who either returned without a shot or had their appointments cancelled. Civic officials told TOI that a consignment of 1.86 lakh doses could reach Mumbai on Friday, but till that happens, centres with zero or few doses may not plan sessions. After a rush triggered by fears of vaccine shortage, the city inoculated 56,909 people. Among them was Sunita Ahire, a resident of Gundavali in Andheri. But she had to wait three hours in the scorching sun with hundreds of others to enter the SevenHills Hospital building from the compound. “We watched in the news that the vaccine was getting over, so we rushed here,” she said. But Marol resident Dicky Alphonso (45) had to return without a shot as Holy Spirit Hospital, Andheri, ran out of doses by 1pm. “Co-WIN should have a mechanism to tell registered people the shots are over,” she said. “Many were sent back from Sion hospital due to unavailability of vaccines. This should not happen to old people who are putting themselves at risk by stepping out of their homes in a pandemic,” said Congress corporator Ravi Raja. The situation was grim across the state, with Yavatmal and Chandrapur districts in Vidarbha on Thursday joining Gondia and Amravati in closing down almost all inoculation centres. In Vasai-Virar, only second doses were given and others were turned away. The state on Wednesday vaccinated 4.37 lakh people, taking the total count of doses administered in Maharashtra to 89.55 lakh. The BMC released a statement on Thursday, saying it had around 50,000 doses left for Friday. “After the use of about 40,000- 50,000 doses (on Thursday), we are left with an equal number which is barely enough for a day,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer. While people may not be able to book online appointments as sessions will not be planned, those walking-in may face disappointment if that particular centre runs out of stocks. Hospitals suggested that people should enquire over the phone about stock status before approaching a centre. Of the 120 vaccination centres in the city, 49 are public and 71 private. Gomare said the public centres may be hit on Friday. The corporation said it had received 17,09,550 doses till April 7. Out of that, 15,61,420 were used and 1,48,130 were left after Wednesday. Of that, 44,810 were Covaxin doses that have to be reserved for second doses. So vaccination opened on Thursday with merely 1,03,320 doses, which was halved during the day. Among private hospitals, Nanavati in Juhu, Bhatia in Tardeo, Holy Family in Bandra may not hold drives on Friday. Sneha Joseph, executive director of Holy Spirit, said they didn’t get fresh stocks on Thursday, so there was uncertainty over Friday’s drive. Dean of SevenHills Dr Balakrishna Adsul said the crowd had swelled because the vaccine stock got over around 11am. “It restarted around 12pm after we managed to get 2,750 doses,” he said.

---||Lucknow||BJP fields Ex-MLA Sengar’s wife Sangeeta from Unnao||LUCKNOW: BJP has fielded Sangeeta Sengar, wife of expelled MLA Kuldeep Sengar, as its candidate from an Unnao zila panchayat member’s seat. She had won the zila panchayat chairman election in 2016 as an independent candidate. Kuldeep was expelled from BJP one and a half years ago after being convicted in a rape case. Sangeeta will contest from Fatehpur Chaurasi-3 ward in Unnao zila panchayat. Sources said she was fielded since the Sengar family still wields influence in Unnao. Her candidature was approved by senior state leaders, including party chief Swatantra Dev Singh and state general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal, at a meeting recently. Sengar, sentenced to life, was disqualified as the MLA in February last year. His brother Atul Senger is facing the accusation of beating the rape survivor’s father who later died in police custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-fields-ex-mla-sengars-wife-sangeeta-from-unnao/articleshow/81978037.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Param Bir Singh's extortion accusation: SC says allegations are serious, allows CBI to probe Anil Deshmukh||NEW DELHI: In a setback to the Maharashtra government and its former home minister Anil Deshmukh, the Supreme Court on Thursday allowed CBI to go ahead with its probe into former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s allegations against the NCP functionary of extortion, bribes for transfers and interference in investigations into important criminal cases. A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hemant Gupta said a probe by an independent agency was needed in the case in view of the involvement of high-profile figures of the level of minister and former police chief in the controversy. The bench said the minister and the police chief were hand-in-glove and working together till they fell apart. It said it was not a case of corporate or political rivalry but a “virtual right hand man” of the minister making allegations against him. Senior advocates A M Singhvi and Kapil Sibal, appearing respectively for the Maharashtra government and Deshmukh, tried their best to convince the bench that the HC order was illegal. SC agrees with Bombay HC order fully, brooks no argumentThe Supreme Court has allowed a CBI probe into former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s allegations against former home minister Anil Deshmukh. Senior advocates A M Singhvi and Kapil Sibal said the HC order was passed without giving an opportunity to the minister to counter the allegations and it will set a bad precedent if a probe is ordered on hearsay without credible evidence. They invoked the SC verdict in the Birla-Sahara diary case to emphasise that investigation against a person can be ordered only when there is prima facie evidence against him and not on the basis of a diary entry or allegations. Sibal said that the law must be equally applicable to all. But the court dismissed their plea and was so convinced about the correctness of the HC order that the order was passed without hearing Param Bir Singh and other opposite parties. Senior advocates Harish Salve, Mukul Rohatgi and Ranjit Kumar did not have to argue the case against the state government and the former minister. “Dehors the niceties of an elaborate order passed by the high court, we are of the view that the nature of allegations, the personas involved and the seriousness of the allegations do require an independent agency to enquire into the matter. It is a matter of public confidence, given the factual scenario. We may also add that what has been directed is only a preliminary enquiry albeit by an independent agency,” the court said in its order. Singhvi and Sibal had contended that CBI probe was not required after Deshmukh’s resignation as home minister. However, the bench was not convinced and it also rejected the plea that the HC order against Deshmukh was wrong as he was not heard. Sibal contended the case should be heard by HC again and he be allowed to counter the allegations and bring on record many things not known so far. “Is this the process of law to order a probe when someone makes statements against others with no supporting documents and material. If that is the law then a probe will be conducted in every unsubstantiated allegation. There must be some evidence to show that a person is prima facie involved in it,” Sibal said. The bench rejected their submission. “We are unable to accept the contentions of A M Singhvi that merely because the home minister has resigned after the impugned order would be a factor not to direct enquiry by an independent agency. The two personas held post of home minister and commissioner of police for a long period and the latter would be a post of confidence of the former. Further, we are unable to accept the contention of Kapil Sibal that even for directing a preliminary enquiry, the petitioner Anil Deshmukh is mandatorily entitled to be heard in his individual capacity even though the state government was represented and he was a minister at that time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sc-agrees-with-bombay-hc-order-fully-brooks-no-argument/articleshow/81978102.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

We also have around 10,000 doses of Covaxin, which have been kept in reserve for the second dose for beneficiaries,” PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil said. There are 80 vaccination centres in the PCMC limits and 60% of those are run by the civic body. In Mumbai too, 25 of the 71 private vaccination centres were unable to inoculate a single person as they had run out of stocks. The situation is likely to worsen on Friday as more private and even a few public centres are likely to exhaust their remaining doses. After Thursday, Mumbai is left with 40,000 to 50,000 doses, barely enough to last a day. The situation was grim across the state, with Yavatmal and Chandrapur districts in Vidarbha on Thursday joining Gondia and Amravati in closing down almost all inoculation centres. In Vasai-Virar, only second doses were given and others were turned away. The state on Wednesday vaccinated 4.37 lakh people, taking the total count of doses administered in Maharashtra to 89.55 lakh. PCMC to halt immunisation drive today over shortage Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “We got to know about the PCMC’s decision to halt the inoculation drive because of the vaccine shortage. As of Thursday evening, we have around 73,000 doses. Of these, around 40,000 are of Covaxin. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), on the other hand, has around 25,000 doses, which would ensure the day’s vaccination without much issues.” Deshmukh added that if the administration received fresh vaccine stock on Friday, it would be distributed on an urgent basis to all inoculation centres. On Wednesday, the Satara district administration had issued a statement saying they would not conduct the vaccination drive on Thursday due to the vaccine shortage. The vaccination drive in Pune district saw inoculation of 54,059 people on Thursday. Pune rural continued with the highest vaccination coverage (25,661), followed by PMC (18,480), and PCMC limits (10,018). The Pune Municipal Corporation’s Bindumadhav Balasaheb Thackeray hospital in Karvenagar and some other vaccination centres were closed on Thursday afternoon due to the shortage of vaccines. A similar situation was reported from some centres in the PCMC limits. A district health official said they have sought more vaccines from the state government and were awaiting fresh stock. PMC additional commissioner Rubal Agarwal said the private hospitals should return the doses, which they might not use, to the civic body. Civic officials told TOI that a consignment of 1.86 lakh doses could reach Mumbai on Friday, but till that happens, centres with zero or few doses may not plan sessions.

---||India||Dassault rejects claim it paid middleman for Rafale deal||NEW DELHI: Dassault, the manufacturer of Rafale fighter aircraft, has rejected the claim of a French media portal that the company, along with its affiliates, paid several million euros to an alleged Indian middleman in order to bag the deal for 36 fighter jets. In a statement here on Thursday, Dassault said the deal went through numerous checks, including by the French anti-corruption agency, and no violations were detected, adding that the company had implemented strict internal procedures to prevent corruption for the last two decades. “Numerous controls are carried out by official organisations, including the French anti-corruption agency. No violations were reported, notably in the frame of the contract with India for the acquisition of 36 Rafales (in 2016),” a Dassault spokesperson said. “The contract with India has been established on a governmentto-government basis. This contract, as well as the offsets corresponding contract, meet the criteria established by these regulations and are being executed in full transparency between the various government and industrial partners,” he added. French portal Mediapart claimed that the Enforcement Directorate did not investigate the payment Dassault and its subsidiaries made to the middleman, Sushen Gupta, despite “evidence” of him having obtained documents from the defence ministry which helped the French aircraft manufacturer clinch the Indian order for the r jets. Significantly, Gupta is facing trial for for receiving payoffs in the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper deal which was negotiated under the UPA. While opposing his bail plea before a special court in 2019, the ED had claimed that a diary retrieved from his Dubai-based chartered accountant Rajiv Saxena, an accused in money laundering cases, had revealed that he had paid Rs 50 crore to one ‘RG’. “Dassault and Thales paid highly for Gupta’s know-how. They hired him at the beginning of the 2000s, at the very moment when India announced it was looking to buy 126 fighter jets,” the French news website claimed. It quoted “evidence from the ED’s case file” to claim that the two French firms “paid him (Gupta) several million euros over the 15 years leading up to the signature of the contract”. The article further said Gupta used shell company IDS to receive payments from Dassault, “the same system he employed in the ‘Choppergate’ scandal for which he now faces prosecution”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/dassault-rejects-claim-it-paid-middleman-for-rafale-deal/articleshow/81979397.cms||---

In one such incident reported from Sayon ka Kheda village in Nathdwara tehsil of Rajsamand district, a male leopard wandered into a house in Gurjar basti past midnight. However, no one was harmed and the house inmates managed to lock the wild cat in a room which was rescued by the forest department in the morning. “The leopard climbed up a 10-feet-high boundary wall and jumped inside the courtyard of the house of one Champalal Gurjar where he was asleep. Hearing the noise, when the people woke up and screamed, the leopard ran into the adjoining house belonging to Champalal's brother Mohanlal, who too was asleep in the open. The leopard got inside a room and immediately, Mohanlal locked the room,” said Mukesh Purohit, the sarpanch pati, who reported the incident to the forest officials thereafter. “It was a male leopard, around 3 to 4 years old. The settlement is surrounded by forest from all sides and it is natural habitat for leopards which are found in good numbers. Perhaps the leopard strayed into the colony in search of food or water,” Ismail Shekh, range officer, Nathdwara told TOI. The forest team arrived in the morning and after inspecting the door size, brought a cage to trap the wild cat. ACF Vinod Rai instructed the officials for the rescue operation which was completed in around 2 hours. The cage which was covered, was placed on the door exactly to fit the size and as the door was let open, the leopard stepped directly inside the cage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/leopard-strays-into-house-in-rajsamand-dist-rescued/articleshow/81976854.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Haridwar Maha Kumbh 2021: Low devotee footfall worries seers||HARIDWAR: A week after the Maha Kumbh officially began, a limited footfall of pilgrims due to Covid-19 RT-PCR report being mandatory, is affecting seers as well as hoteliers. Seers said they are hardly receiving any visitors this festival. Hoteliers and other stakeholders of the tourism industry are staring at huge losses as well. According to sources, the turnout is less than one-tenth of the expected numbers. Swami Ajay Giri, also known as 'Rudraksh Baba', whose camp is located at Tulsi Chowk in the city area, told TOI, “I belong to Niranjani akhada and came from Haryana. I installed my camp after saints of Niranjani akhada entered the city in March. But this time devotees are not visiting the camp.” He added, “Only a few locals visit the camp . I also participated in the 2010 Kumbh, but this time low footfall due to Covid-19 guidelines being enforced is a matter of great concern for the seer community. I hope devotees will come for the upcoming shahi snan.” Khadeshwar Baba, another seer, also expressed similar sentiments.“Only limited pilgrims are coming to seek blessings from us. It doesn’t matter for seers though. We have a duty to come to the Kumbh. ” Saints of all seven sanyasi akhadas have installed their camps while Bairagi saints have started camping in the Bairagi camp area. Also, Kinnar akhada is another main attraction of the Kumbh mela. Even though they did not get land for camping, a few Kinnar saints have set up their camps near Juna akhada where locals can often be seen taking selfies with them. Low footfall of pilgrims from other states is worrying many in the hotel business as well. Vibhas Mishra, president of Haridwar’s hoteliers' association, said, “Kumbh mela was a great opportunity for the government to revive the hotel industry which has been facing huge economic losses due to Covid-19 pandemic. But the government created a negative environment about the Kumbh mela. Recently, the government tried to take a clear stand, but it was too late. Now, the result is that the pilgrims are not showing much interest in visiting the mela.”Hoteliers Also Affected||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/low-devotee-footfall-worries-seers/articleshow/81975591.cms||MS Nawaz

Ambasana is heard saying that people from the community who are traditionally in the furniture making business should stop the work and get into farming. He said that the furniture business has reached a saturation point as people from other communities have started it. In the four-minute-long video, Ambasana also hurls abuses at the communities. Police said that the video had become viral in several villages in Lalpur and before it could instigate anyone, Ambasana was booked. According to police, after making the video, Ambasana has disappeared from the village and teams have been formed to nab him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/man-booked-for-making-abusive-video/articleshow/81975590.cms||---
---||Lucknow||UP: Waqf to appeal against ASI survey of Gyanvapi||AYODHYA: The Sunni Central Waqf Board has decided to move the High Court against the order of Varanasi civil judge for archaeological survey of Gyanvapi complex compound. Sunni Waqf Board chairman Zufar Farooqui told TOI on Thursday, “We are moving the high court against this order. We think this order is in violation of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 that was also forcefully endorsed by the Supreme Court in its Ayodhya title suit judgment.” “The order of the civil judge, Varanasi court, ordering a survey by the Archaeological Survey of India will be challenged in the high court. Our understanding is clear that this case is barred by the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991,” he added. Farooqui further said that The Places of Worship Act was upheld by the five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in the Ayodhya verdict as hence the status of Gyanvapi Masjid is, as such, beyond question. Even otherwise, we can say as per legal advice that the order of survey is questionable because technical evidence can only supplement certain foundational facts, he claimed. “No evidence has been produced before the lower court that suggests there was a prior existing temple at the site of the mosque. Even in the Ayodhya judgment, the ASI excavation was ultimately of no use. The ASI could not prove that Babri Masjid was built after demolishing the temple,” the Sunni Waqf Board chairman asserted. The Supreme Court has specifically observed that there was no such evidence. Thus, this practice of mosques being ‘surveyed’ by the ASI has to be stopped. We will approach the high court against this unwarranted order immediately, said Farooqui.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/waqf-to-appeal-against-asi-survey-of-gyanvapi/articleshow/81978072.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

---||Hyderabad||TRS & BJP gearing up for another GHMC, ULB joust||HYDERABAD: TRS and BJP are heading for another showdown in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation and other urban local bodies (ULBs). Telangana State Election Commission has decided to hold bypoll to Lingojiguda ward in GHMC. BJP had won the ward in December 2020 GHMC elections, but its corporator-elect Akula Ramesh Goud died before taking oath. Even though it is a matter of a ward, the talk in political circles is that both TRS and BJP would go all out to win the seat. While it is crucial for the saffron party to retain the seat to prove that it is fast emerging as an alternative to the ruling party, TRS wants to show BJP its place. Lingojiguda ward would go to bypoll along with elections to seven urban local bodies (ULBs), including Greater Warangal and Khammam municipal corporations. Along with the elections to seven ULBs, bypoll would be held to nine wards which fell vacant for various reasons in the municipal bodies of GHMC, Gajwel, Nalgonda, Jalpally, Alampur, Bodhan, Parkal, Metpally and Bellampally. A big fight is expected between TRS, BJP and Congress in all these ULBs. The SEC has already issued notification as per which the draft of ward-wise photo electoral rolls was published on April 5, objections and suggestions would be received till April 9, disposal of objections on April 10, and publication of ward-wise photo electoral rolls would be on April 11. After the completion of this process and finalisation of polling booths and reservations, the SEC would announce the poll schedule to ULBs around April 15 and is likely to hold polls in the last week of this month or first week of May. BJP chief spokesperson Krishna Saagar Rao told TOI that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has initiated municipal elections process on expected lines and was trying to rush through, immediately after Nagarjunasagar bypoll.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-bjp-gearing-up-for-another-ghmc-ulb-joust/articleshow/81976846.cms||Roushan Ali
---||World||French President Emmanuel Macron set to close France’s elite school||PARIS: French President Emmanuel Macron is on Thursday to abolish the top university he attended along with four of the last six presidents in a move portrayed as a blow against elitism and in favour of greater diversity. The Ecole Nationale d'Administration, known as ENA, is a small Strasbourg-based finishing school for top civil servants that plays an outsized role in French public life. Created in the aftermath of World War II, admission virtually guarantees an influential job in the upper reaches of the public sector and has long been viewed as the most promising route into politics. Macron, who attended from 2002-2004, announced plans to scrap the institution in 2019 following "yellow vest" anti-government protests which highlighted inequality. Later Thursday, he was set to announce a new school with a new name that will be responsible for training students for senior public sector roles, with an emphasis on opening up pathways for people from poorer or ethnic minority backgrounds. The idea is to "offer closer, more efficient, more transparent and more benevolent public services to French people," an aide told reporters ahead of the announcement. Macron has previously criticised ENA for taking in fewer students from a working-class background than at the end of the last century, even though the school is in theory open to all. In February, Macron said that 1,000 places would be created in two new programmes to prepare students from disadvantaged backgrounds for applying to France's top colleges. He said the "social elevator" in France -- the process by which people from poorer backgrounds rise to prominent positions -- "works less well than 50 years ago". Studies show that ENA's student intake is dominated by the children of wealthy, professional families. "Among the vital problems in France, there is one that you are aware of every day: it's the absolute fracture between the base of society -- people who work, who are retired, who are unemployed, young people, students -- and the supposed elite," Francois Bayrou, a close political ally of Macron, told France Inter radio on Thursday. The school was created in 1945 when France needed to rebuild its civil service, parts of which had collaborated with France's Nazi occupiers during World War II. It succeeded initially in opening up the vast public administration to people drawn from different backgrounds, rather than the old aristocracy which had traditionally dominated the French state. Its success in producing highly-qualified public administrators has spawned copycat institutions in other countries, however, including Russia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/french-president-emmanuel-macron-set-to-close-frances-elite-school/articleshow/81979393.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Mithun roadshows: Tolly gets nod but not Behala||Kolkata: The denial of permission for a Mithun Chakraborty roadshow in Behala on Thursday led to an agitation by BJP supporters in Behala West as well as Behala East as they saw it as a missed opportunity to give the party an “extra push” on the last day of campaign ahead of the Phase IV elections on Saturday. BJP workers, led by party’s Behala West candidate Srabanti Chatterjee, converged on the Parnasree police station and reportedly had a scuffle with on-duty cops, complaining about discrimination. Srabanti subsequently took out a protest rally along the route where Mithun was supposed to hold the roadshow that led to a police FIR. The supporters claimed police had denied the permission fpr the roadshow at the last moment. Mithun could take out his rally in Tollygunge, where the procession was given the go-ahead. In Behala, BJP had planned Mithun’s roadshow from the Parnasree bus stand to Roy Bahadur Road, covering both the constituencies of Behala East and West. In Behala West, the assembly election contest is between Trinamool veteran Partha Chatterjee and actor Srabanti, while Behala East will witness a fight between Trinamool’s Ratna Chatterjee, the estranged wife of Sovan Chatterjee, and actor Paayel Sarkar. BJP leaders complained that they had sought permission for the roadshow on Wednesday evening through Suvidha App. It was rejected. “We then applied for the roadshow permission at the Parnasree police station. But it was denied yet again. As a last resort, we applied for a door-to-door campaign. The permission for that, too, was denied by police. We have no clarity on why it was denied,” said BJP Behala West-2 president Rabin Roy. Police, however, said BJP had not applied for permission for any rally or roadshow from Parnasree bus stand, while an earlier one for Rabindra Nagar was rejected. The Behala West BJP candidate saw a “Trinamool hand” in the police action. “They (Trinamool) are worried that they will lose. But they cannot stop BJP by resorting to such antics. I will speak to senior party functionaries and decide on the next course of action,” said Srabanti. Trinamool spokesperson Tapas Roy, however, denied the charge. “Everything is decided by the EC through Suvidha App. Trinamool has no role in these aspects,” Roy said. Pointing out that BJP had not applied for permission for a roadshow from Parnasree bus stand, an officer said, “On Wednesday, they mailed us, seeking to know if they needed to apply for permission from us for a roadshow. We said they had to go through Suvidha App.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mithun-roadshows-tolly-gets-nod-but-not-behala/articleshow/81976862.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The hearing before additional sessions judge Neelofer Abida Parveen was connected to Sidhu’s bail plea. Sidhu’s counsel Abhishek Gupta argued that the call for the protest was by farmer leaders, and his client was not a member of any of the farmers’ union. He added that Sidhu was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. “There is no evidence that I have mobilised the crowd,” Sidhu stated. The prosecutor, however, argued that fundamental rights did not mean that one could harm police officials. The hearing in the matter will continue on April 12. In an earlier hearing, when Sidhu sought a free and impartial investigation, his counsel had argued that there was no video of him calling people to gather at Red Fort. “He did not indulge in any kind of violence. He was only a peaceful protester. In fact, he was staying at a hotel in Murthal. He checked out from there at 12noon. By that time people had already reached Lal Qila,” it was argued. Gupta had also contended that CCTV footage of the hotel could show that Sidhu had left the hotel only at 12noon. “Further, his call records and mobile location will also establish timing of his presence enroute Murthal to Red Fort,” he added. “No call was ever made by him in connection with going to Red Fort, nor did he join any tractor rally,” Sidhu’s plea stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/didnt-mobilise-crowd-deep-sidhu-tells-court/articleshow/81976871.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Spurt in Covid-like symptoms at Singhu border, farmers not keen on tests||NEW DELHI: The farmers protesting at Singhu border since November last year visited the medical kiosks there mostly for help with stomach ailments and recently from heatstroke. But more lately, an increasing number of people are going to the volunteer doctors with complaints of fever, cough and other symptoms often associated with the Covid-19 infection. While a few doctors feared these could indeed be coronavirus cases, there is no way to make sure because no tests are carried out at the protest site. On April 6, a 40-bed makeshift hospital came up near the main stage at Singhu border. It was built for the agitating farmers by the Indian National Lok Dal. Doctors at the hospital disclosed that “every third case” is of someone suffering from dry cough, fever and body ache, which are also symptoms of Covid. “Despite all this, we cannot establish Covid testing here because the protestors may not like the idea,” revealed one doctor. Parikshit Malik, a doctor from Sonipat working at the new hospital, elaborated on why tests may only annoy the protesters. “The farmers oppose Covid tests because they don’t want it to become the reason for their dispersal from the area,” Malik explained. “In any case, to show their anger at the government, the farmers aren’t keen on masks either. The hospital staff keep urging people come here for treatment not to ignore such precautions, but not many are keen about even getting themselves vaccinated.” Another doctor also said, “An increasing number of protesters are showing symptoms of flu, so we tell them to be cautious. But we may never know if they are Covid-positive or not.” Covid is, however, not a topic for avid discussion at the Singhu border. Avtar Singh, co-founder of an eight-bed hospital set up on January 8 by NGO Life Care Foundation there, asserted, “There are no Covid cases at the protest site. Many people come here with common ailments and if someone is seriously ill, we shift the individual to a hospital where Covid tests are done. No one from here as yet has proved to be Covid-positive. No Covid deaths either. People have good immunity and are eating well.” Avtar Singh also said, “We and the staff have worked here for months now, and none of us have contracted the coronavirus despite treating thousands of people in this period.” Paramjit Singh of Jai Kisan Andolan and member of the protest organising committee also had the same refrain. “We have no information of Covid cases at the protest site,” he claimed. “We have only had cases of heatstroke, for which we are setting up fans, while some protestors have put up ACs and coolers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/spurt-in-covid-like-symptoms-at-singhu-farmers-not-keen-on-tests/articleshow/81976869.cms||---

But it said that the rules will change if the Centre amends them.The Ministry of Power in its Electricity (Rights to Consumers) Rules, 2020 had said that load capacity of above 10 kilowatt will not be considered for net metering putting at risk majority of the rooftop projects.RERC had also used the norms to deny net metering benefits to projects above 10kw by putting them under gross billing or metering category. Under the gross billing or metering, the project owner will have to pay normal electricity rate to discoms even though it uses cheap power from its rooftop plant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rerc-to-change-rooftop-solar-guidelines-if-central-govt-does/articleshow/81976857.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Stop politics, ensure vax supply: Uddhav to Modi||Mumbai: Stressing that Maharashtra has never lagged in the fight against Covid and that it never will, CM Uddhav Thackeray asked PM Modi on Thursday to intervene and stop the politics over the pandemic, a day after Union health minister Harsh Vardhan lashed out against the state, reports Bhavika Jain. Speaking at a PM-CMs meet, he said the Centre should deliver vaccines according to the state’s needs and pointed out that the promise of 17.4 lakh doses from the Centre after April 15 will mean a lull in the drive. Interestingly, figures released by the Centre claim that Maharashtra will be getting 19.4 lakh doses. The state added that as on Thursday morning, it had vaccines for less than two days. After requesting PM Modi to address leaders across parties to stop politics over the pandemic, CM Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday reiterated the demand to allow vaccination of everyone above 25 and said the Centre should let Haffkine Institute in the state to manufacture vaccine. A proposal has been sent to the Centre, and once approved, the facility can generate 228 million doses per year. There is a shortage of vaccine in the state and some vaccination centres are shut. “The central government has said 17.4 lakh doses will be given after April 15. The delay will hamper the vaccination drive. Therefore, vaccine stocks should be delivered as per our demand,” said Thackeray. The state needs 40 lakh doses every week to meet its objective of vaccinating 1.8 crore people in the priority groups. So far, 1.06 crore doses have arrived and 92-95 lakh have been administered. With active cases going up in the state, Thackeray said the requirement for oxygen is estimated to rise and sought the Centre’s assistance for adequate supply. “It is expected that the demand for medical oxygen will go up to 1,700-2,500 MT by the end of this month,” said Thackeray. The state’s oxygen production capacity is 1,200 MT. Maharashtra sought 1,200 more ventilators and repairing of some given earlier to make them operational again. As on Thursday, 40% of ventilator beds in the state were occupied, it was pointed out. Thackeray also asked the Drugs Controller General of India to curb the misuse of anti-viral injection Remdesivir and stop its export. “As of today, 50-60,000 vials of injections are being used (for treatment), which will go up to 1 lakh in the next few days. ICMR should finalise a protocol for its use,” said Thackeray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/stop-politics-ensure-vax-supply-uddhav-to-modi/articleshow/81978975.cms||---

The fraud occurred in December last year. The private bank, which issued the credit card, conducted an internal inquiry, and refunded the money to the customer. Its deputy manager lodged a police complaint on Wednesday. When contacted, the complainant refused to comment. Inspector Ajay Jogdand, who is investigating the case, said the customer approached the complainant on December 31, claiming that his credit card was used to purchase an air ticket to Sharjah. “The complainant checked the system and found that the card was used outside India on December 24, 2020, and that an air ticket worth Rs29,748 was purchased,” Jogdand said. “The customer never travelled outside the country, nor did he receive any call seeking his card details,” Jogdand said. A preliminary probe showed the card was cloned. “We are looking into how the fraudsters gained access to the card details,” Jogdand said. The police have reached out to the Mumbai police, who recently busted a card cloning racket. “We are seeking more details from them,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bank-duped-of-rs-rs-30k-in-credit-card-cloning-case/articleshow/81976874.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Letter bomb’ against Sachin Waze says he settled BMC e-tendering scam with contractors||MUMBAI: A day after arrested assistant police inspector Sachin Waze in a letter alleged that Shiv Sena minister Anil Parab had asked him to identify 50 fraudulent contractors and collect Rs 2 crore from them, a letter dated March 19 has emerged which has accused Waze of “settling the issue” with the contractors in the recent BMC e-tendering scam. The letter, sent by one John Micheal D’Costa to municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal and commissioner of police Hemant Nagrale, demanded that a probe be initiated into the Rs 500-crore e-tendering scam in the BMC and claimed that Waze, who was investigating the racket, had ‘settled’ the matter. The letter was sent six days after Waze’s arrest on March 13. When contacted, Waze’s lawyers refrained from commenting on the matter. In February, there were complaints about hacking of bids by a cartel of contractors who allegedly managed to breach the BMC’s online tendering system, check the bids and then quote lower bids to bag contracts worth hundreds of crores. It was alleged that a section of contractors got access to the ‘wallet balance’ and rates quoted by other contractors at the time of submission of online bids. The municipal corporation launched a digital forensic investigation following written complaints in the names of Allarakha and Ramlalla alleging rigging of tenders by breaching the e-tendering system. A committee of senior officials and independent experts were formed to study the forensic audit report and make changes to the online bidding system. But D’Costa’s letter dated March 19, which was delivered to Chahal’s office in the BMC headquarters and marked to several top officials including Nagrale, claimed that Waze had summoned several BMC contractors for the investigation and ‘settled’ the matter. “...on complaints of Allarakha and Ramlalla, a BMC internal investigation is under process and a digital forensic report is awaited for filing an FIR. The police headquarters appointed Waze as investigation officer. Initially investigation was going on with contractors, but Waze has settled the issue and no inquiry is going on from the last 30 days. It is requested that the municipal commissioner and commissioner of police start the pending investigation and depute any sincere police officer,” the letter stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-letter-bomb-against-waze-says-he-settled-bmc-e-tendering-scam-with-contractors/articleshow/81978176.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

But the strategy backfired in Kumbakonam where people gathered in front of a grocery shop seeking essentials against the token distributed by a party. An AMMK functionary was subsequently booked for bribing voters. Kanagaraj, Karuppur branch secretary of the party, was booked under section 171E of the IPC based on a complaint lodged by village administrative officer Surendra Kumar. According to police, the VAO in his preliminary inquiry found that Kanagaraj had distributed tokens to voters seeking their votes in favour of his party. This led the crowd to gather in front of Priyam Malligai Agencies on Big Bazaar street in Kumbakonam. S Balamurugan is the AMMK candidate in Kumbakonam and G Anbazhagan the DMK candidate. According to K Sheik Mohamed Rawther, proprietor of Priyam Malligai Agencies, people started gathering in front of his shop a day before the election. “I was puzzled to find over a 100 people in front of the shop on Monday morning with the tokens. I chose to shut the shop seeing the crowd swelling,” he said. He pasted a notice in front of his shop saying that the shop has nothing to do with the tokens issued by candidates. Despite the announcement, people gathered in front of the shop on Wednesday, a day after the election, seeking groceries against tokens. “When I explained matters to them, many returned,” said Rawther. As word spread about the crowd in front of the shop, district collector M Govinda Rao directed the VAO to inquire into it. The AMMK functionary was booked after the VAO lodged a complaint with Kumbakonam police. “Preliminary investigation has revealed that token distribution has indeed taken place and functionary of the said political party was also booked for bribing voters,” said Rao. He assured that suitable action will be taken against those involved in bribing voters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/case-against-ammk-man-for-voter-bribing-in-kumbakonam/articleshow/81976893.cms||---

The two facilities together have 580 beds to quarantine and treat asymptomatic cases. Simultaneously, the health department has increased RT-PCR testing to 4,000 samples per day from 3,000.The covid care centre has been established in two blocks at Bharathidasan University’s campus in Khajamalai with 180 beds including 120 for men and 60 for women. The centre has the capacity to add 20 more beds. Owing to increased testing and infection spreading fast, health officials said that the district on an average records 120 cases per day. Last week, Trichy reported 881 new positive cases, of which 50% of the primary contacts are asymptomatic. Though asymptomatic patients without any comorbid conditions are allowed for home quarantine, Covid care centres were established to quarantine asymptomatic cases without adequate isolation facility. Similarly, the district administration has made arrangements to add 400 beds initially at the government engineering college at Sethurappatti on Madurai NH. “The government college facility can be extended to accommodate 600 beds. We are readying food arrangements and medical teams to be stationed at the centre,” a senior health official said.The two care centres are touted to be adequate to deal with the surge in cases while the GH and private hospitals have adequate beds to treat symptomatic cases, the official added. The health department claimed that the surge in infection was due to unnecessary travel by both symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers. Although there are no active clusters, the district administration and Trichy corporation are conducting random tests in people gathering places as part of early intervention. While testing has already increased by over 150%, the district administration is considering increasing testing further to 5,500 samples per day. “Areas that report more cases will be identified to promote vaccination against Covid-19,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/two-covid-care-centres-in-trichy-to-treat-mild-cases/articleshow/81976929.cms||Deepak Karthik

He intended to kill his father and three more brothers who were also present in the house, but because of the ruckus that erupted, other family members and neighbours came out to overpower him, but the accused fled from the scene, police said. He was later arrested from Jabarkiya village, 12km from the spot of crime, around 5pm on Thursday. The incident took place in Bhinai town of the district early on Thursday. The accused Amachand Jangid was preparing for REET examination in Jaipur. It is said that the exam was delayed for two years and he also tried for a job in a private school. But because of the pandemic, he failed to get any job. He returned to Bhinai where his parents stayed with a younger son. Three more brothers of the accused came to the town from Ajmer a day before the incident. According to police, at 2.30am on Thursday, Amarchand came out of his room, cut off electricity and bolted the main gate from inside. He found an iron hammer in the gallery as the father of the accused is a carpenter. He took the hammer and went to the room of his mother Kamala, 61, and hit her on the head. She died on the spot. The accused came out and went to the room of his brother Shivraj, 22, and bludgeoned him to death. The victims were in deep sleep when they were attacked. In the meantime, his father Ramdhan, 65, awoke on hearing some commotion and found that his son Amarchand, wielding a hammer, was going into the room where his three brothers were sleeping. Ramdhan called out his sons and all three — Bhagchand, Omprakash and Tarachand, got up from their beds and overpowered Amarchand. Even neighbours came out for help. Looking at people trying to control him, the accused fled from his house. Police said they sent the bodies for post-mortem and registered a case. Prima facie, it appears that the accused killed them under depression, but police will verify certain things to know the cause of the crime. Police got a call from villagers of Jabarkiya that a youth was trying to hide in the fields. Police reached the spot and when interrogated him, they discovered that he was Amarchand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/youth-hammers-brother-and-mom-to-death-in-bhinai-held/articleshow/81976898.cms||---

A cub can only go eight days without its mother. A fortnight on, as the cubs lie hunched up in a bundle at their enclosure at the Lucknow Zoo, always together, veterinarians believe this is precisely how they survived — they banded together. And as the cubs, three male and one female, gradually get used to life on their own without their mother, they follow the strongest of the streak for cues. “When we found them (on March 24), the cubs were traumatised and dehydrated. They had possibly survived by scavenging on the remains of kills by other carnivores,” said Dr Daksh Gangwar, veterinarian at the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve. The cubs, just two months old, were found 1km from their mother’s carcass. “Studies have shown that a tiger stays with its mother for 18 months and a tigress, for 22 … These cubs were so small they couldn’t even kill a rabbit. But they stuck together, which possibly saved them.” They were taken to the Lucknow Zoo a day after they were rescued so they could be brought up in a relatively controlled environment. They seem to be doing well. “They are adapting to captivity. They've gained weight. Their diet has gone from 1kg chicken to 2kg buff each. But they are still scared when anyone approaches their enclosure,” said Dr Brijendra Yadav, veterinarian at the Lucknow Zoo. “They lie bunched up together. It seems three of them follow the strongest of the streak . In the wild, the survival of all four cubs would have been extremely difficult. Only the stronger ones survive. We, too, face a challenge in saving them all." But one of the things the zoo authorities have to ensure is that the cubs don’t get infected. “They are kept in isolation. Only their keeper Nasir is allowed to enter after wearing proper protective equipment to ensure no infection is carried inside. The ward is sanitised regularly … We are sharing their health status with senior officials,” said Dr Ashok Kashyap, senior veterinarian at Lucknow Zoo. For now, an official at the zoo said, the cubs will remain in isolation, away from visitors. “We are ensuring they adapt and survive the captive environment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/4-motherless-tiger-cubs-survived-by-banding-together-theys-still-thick/articleshow/81974088.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

On Wednesday, we formally registered a case of cheating and forgery offences and started our probe.” Shinde said, “The two contractors are based in Hyderabad.

---||Lucknow||Six to eight-hour agonising wait for kin at electric crematoriums||LUCKNOW: Long queues outside two electric crematoriums -- Baikunth Dham and Gulala Ghat -- in the city can be seen these days due to surge in Covid-19 deaths. As electric cremation is advised in such a case, people have to wait for six to eight hours for their turn to cremate their loved ones. “The two electric crematoriums have two machines each. On an average 30 bodies -- from Lucknow and adjoining districts -- are coming for cremations at the two places. Since it takes at least two hours to cremate a body with full Covid protocols, there is a long waiting list. So much so that we have to issue tokens to people for their turn,” said LMC chief engineer RN Tripathi. At Baikunth Dham, Aasha Devi, a resident of Sitapur, had come along with the family to cremate her father who died due to Covid-19 while under treatment in Lucknow. "We came here around 11 am and got the fifth token number. It is around 3:30 pm now, but we are still waiting. Such a long wait is torturous after days of mental trauma of first seeing our father suffering from Covid and then losing the battle with the disease.” Jeetu, whose elder sister succumbed to the deadly virus, said "We are waiting for the past three hours and still don't know when my sister's last rites will be performed. My family members have not eaten anything since last night after the casualty. First, you have to wait for a long time to get custody of the body and then for cremation.” Caretaker at Baikunth Dham Munna said, "About 105 bodies have come for cremation in the past one week. Last rites of 18 were performed on Thursday. Everyone involved in the cremation has to wear a PPE kit and machines have to be sanitised after each funeral.” Greenatorium to be installed soon: The pressure on the two electric crematorium is expected to ease with the start of the 'Greenatorium’ in the next few days. It will be the first Greenatorium of the city, said city mayor Sanyukta Bhatia. Two machines for cremations have already been installed in Baikunth Dham. Officials said that the greenatorium used a technology in which cremation is performed in a traditional way without causing air pollution. The machine has a cascade where the body is put on the pyre. After performing last rituals, the pyre is lit up and the chamber is closed. The chamber uses about 150 kg wood to generate enough heat required for burning of the body. The mechanism also has a filtration that prevents emission of toxic gas into the atmosphere. Cost of cremation in Greenatorium is between Rs 300-500.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/six-to-eight-hour-agonising-wait-for-kin-at-electric-crematoriums/articleshow/81978182.cms||Pranchal Srivastava

The most industrialised constituency in the district, it registered 66.74% turnout, a tad lower than the 67.83% registered in 2016. Migration of workforce, relocation of families of officials retiring from industries and young voters settled abroad were cited as possible reasons for the low turnout.Even in the 2019 general election, assembly constituency-wise turnout reveals that Thiruverumbur had recorded only 63.4%. While it is common for an urbanised constituency to poll lower than the rural segment, Thiruverumbur boasts an equal proportion of rural and urban voters. Yet, it polls lower than completely urbanised segments like Trichy West and Trichy East. The constituency has Bhel Trichy, Ordnance Factory Trichy and Southern Railway’s Golden Rock workshop. While a section of retiring officials settle locally, others opt to return to their native places though many have not changed their voting place. “In the workshop alone, we are witnessing 20 to 30 retirements per month. There are families that have relocated to other districts but still have their votes in the constituency,” K C Neelamegam, a railway employee, said.Migration of workforce depending on the MSMEs in Thiruverumbur industrial area such as Ariyamangalam was cited as another reason. With MSMEs gradually closing down, the breadwinners are employed elsewhere but have their votes locally. Bhel employees who retired from service but continue to reside in Thiruverumbur have their children studying or working abroad, which is another factor influencing the turnout. “Many of my friends and my family members have not voted this time as they were settled abroad and in other states. The urban areas of the constituency have young NRI voters working in the Gulf,” K Shyamsundar, a voter , added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/thiruverumbur-continues-its-poor-show-in-polling-percentage/articleshow/81976963.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Mumbai||With petrol pump plan, railway police branch out into beyond-crime arena||MUMBAI: In a first-of-its-kind project for Mumbai, a police-owned petrol pump is set to come up on Eastern Express Highway (EEH) at Ghatkopar (east) later this year. At present, there is no fuelling station between Sion and Mulund on EEH. Plans are also afoot to develop a plaza, adjacent to the petrol pump to house a fast food joint or a cafe, an ATM and consumer goods outlets. Mumbai Government Railway Police (GRP) have tied up with Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd for this project. The GRP owns 35 acres of land on the fringes of the EEH at Ghatkopar which has police residential quarters and a ground. The pump will come up on a 3,600-sqm plot on this land. Revenue that is generated will go to the police welfare fund. GRP commissioner Quaiser Khalid said it would not only benefit motorists using the EEH but would also generate employment for policemen’s families.  This project is an unusual departure from the usual policing tasks in the city. Khalid said it would serve as a model for other departments to replicate. “Not only will it give the GRP a unique identity, but also the fact that the pump will be police-owned would lend it much credibility,” he said. Deputy commissioner of police Pradeep Chavan that said the pump will have 16 petrol-filling stations besides CNG stations and would need between 50 and 100 employees to operate the setup. “Besides recruiting workers with experience, we will also hire from families of retired as well as serving policemen who are interested in these jobs,” said Chavan. Around 850 families reside at the police quarters in Ghatkopar. Khalid recently carried out the ‘bhoomipuja’ for the project with BPCL executive’s director (retail) PS Ravi. The pump will be at a key location where a new bridge linking Ghatkopar and Kurla will come up. “BPCL will install the pump and transfer it to the police department,” said Chavan, adding that the tendering process has begun. “The pump would’ve been ready by July but the second Covid wave is likely to push it by a few months,” For the plaza, the plan is to have a three-storey structure. Meanwhile, BPCL has inked a pact with the railway police to develop the ground at Ghatkopar into a professional sports arena for football, volleyball, net cricket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-railway-police-to-set-up-first-fuel-pump-on-the-sion-mulund-stretch-along-eeh/articleshow/81978247.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Trichy||Friends beyond faith for 40 years, they pass away one after another||Trichy: A life-size obituary banner with portraits of two elderly men sprung up on Jubilee road in Jayankondam town in Ariyalur on Wednesday afternoon as many residents gazed in disbelief. K Mahalingam, 70, and P Jailabudeen, 66, thick friends for 40 years, had passed away within a space of 30 minutes just the previous night. Both families had erected the common banner as testimony to a friendship that transcended religious and professional barriers. Mahalingam was priest at the Mariamman temple on Vriddachalam road and had been running a tea stall near the temple. Jailabudeen was a rice mill owner staying opposite to his house on Jubilee road. Their families recall that the two addressed each other as mama-mapla (informally used between close friends). Being a priest, Mahalingam was a staunch believer in Hindu rituals and was often seen with holy ash smeared on his forehead while Jailabudeen followed Islam. “No function or festival in our house happened in the absence of Jailabudeen thatha (grandfather). They used to tell us that they were neighbours even as young boys and hung out together,” says S Guru, Mahalingam’s grandson. “My family always consulted Mahalingam thatha while hosting any function. Wish we had a snap of the two while they were alive, the deaths were sudden,” Abdul Rashith, grandson of Jailabudeen, said. Family members say Mahalingam who had hypertension complained of uneasiness on Tuesday noon. He was rushed to a nearby private hospital by his family in an autorickshaw. They were not aware that Jailabudeen was already at the hospital after he also showed some discomforts. Both were referred to Jayankondam GH and admitted to the same ward. Jailabudeen had chest pain, according to his grandson, and he fell unconscious and died around 4 pm. When Mahalingam was informed about the death of his friend, the families said he was already slipping away, but tears welled in his eyes. He breathed his last half an hour later. Mahalingam was cremated at the cremation ground in Jayankondam town while Jailabudeen was buried at the Muslim burial ground on the outskirts on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/friends-beyond-faith-for-40-years-they-pass-away-one-after-another/articleshow/81976951.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Lucknow||Delay in RT-PCR report posing problem to patients||Lucknow: Overwhelmed by the exponential surge in Covid-19 in the past 10 days, government and private labs are taking 2-4 days in giving results, posing problems to people suspected to have been infected by novel coronavirus as well as serious non-Covid patients for whom it is now mandatory to bring test reports for getting treatment in major hospitals. Many private labs have also stopped home collection. There are 17 private labs authorised for Covid tests. These labs conduct around 3,500 tests through RT-PCR method daily. Besides, three government supported labs at KGMU, SGPGIMS and RMLIMS together conduct around 20,000 RT-PCR tests per day. However, these three labs are getting nearly 30,000 samples daily from the city and state. Dr Amit Rastogi, president of the private pathologists’ association, said that results are delayed because of work overload and lack of hands. “We have to stop home collection because many staff members are scared of catching infection.” Chief development officer Prabhash Kumar, in-charge of Covid coordination in Lucknow, said that meetings with labs were held on Thursday to ramp up the testing. Rimjhim Singh (25) gave her samples at a government hospital for testing on April 3 after surfacing influenza like symptoms. However, when no report came even after 48 hours and she started feeling uneasy, on the advice of family doctors, the private executive began Covid medication and contacted five private labs for tests so that she can at least be confirmed about her status. “However, none of the private lab was ready to collect samples from home. Also, all said that they will take at least two-three days to give the result. Fortunately, a private lab on Rae Bareli road agreed for home collection,” said Singh while narrating her ordeal. “In the meantime, the government lab uploaded the result after four days on Tuesday night. It said that I was negative, but the report of the private lab that came on Wednesday was positive. The four days were not only mentally traumatising, but also put my family at risk,” she added. Aazhar Ali (45) has been suffering from acute pain due to oral cancer for the past 10 days. Doctors at KGMU advised surgery, but to get admission in the hospital, he needed a Covid test report. He gave samples to a government lab on Monday, but results are still awaited. “The pain is unbearable and I need immediate medical intervention. I don't know what to do without the test report,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/delay-in-rt-pcr-report-posing-problem-to-patients/articleshow/81978217.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Frontline risk: 30% cops & BEST staff yet to get jabs in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Even as a large chunk of the city’s frontline workers—the police force and BEST staff—has got vaccinated against Covid-19, there are still thousands who are still to get their first shots and thus continue to be at risk of contracting the infection daily. Latest trends show, on an average, 148 state police personnel and seven BEST staffers test positive in a day. Yet, around 35% cops and 30% BEST staffers are still to be inoculated. The stated reasons for the delay range from waiting for their scheduled appointment to reluctance on the part of some.  A BEST official said 34,000 staffers had registered for the vaccine. Of these, 24,000 have got the jabs, including 9,000 who have received the second. As many as 10,000 staffers, including a section of drivers and conductors, though, haven’t. “We are confident of getting the rest vaccinated soon. There are 150 to 200 staffers going in for vaccine doses daily,” said Anil Kumar Singal, chief medical officer, BEST. He said those who are reluctant are being persuaded. “We are trying all possible methods—be it counselling them on how safe the vaccines are, the importance of taking the jabs or through messages on mobile phones and workshops,” he said.  As on April 5, 29,822 of 41,082 Mumbai police personnel had been vaccinated. Similarly, in the state force, a total of 1,23,555 have got their first dose, excluding Mumbai. Meanwhile, 60,419 personnel in the state, including 15,969 from Mumbai, have taken their second dose. Police officials said 70-75% of their personnel have taken the vaccine so far and no one has shown any hesitation. State police spokesperson DCP Manoj Patil said the drive is being carried out as per schedule. Currently, the Mumbai police force has 413 active cases and the state’s 2,764. Union health minister Harsh Vardhan had pointed out on Wednesday Maharashtra has vaccinated just 73% frontline workers with the first dose. “There are five Indian states/UTs that have already done more than 85%,” he said. Meanwhile, both Central and Western Railway aim to vaccinate around 500 employees daily. Till March 31, only healthcare workers and frontline employees such as train running crew, ticketing staff and booking clerks were allowed. CR’s chief public relations officer Shivaji Sutar said, “We have vaccinated around 25% of the total 32,500 workforce in Mumbai division; 60% of those eligible have been covered in Mumbai division...We aim to vaccinate 500 a day.”  Till now, vaccination was provided at the railway hospital in Kalyan and Byculla. He said, “One more centre opened at Thane on Wednesday. One centre each will come up at Parel, Panvel and Igatpuri.” WR’s chief public relations officer Sumit Thakur said, “In Mumbai division, we have vaccination facilities at the railway hospitals in Mumbai Central, Surat and Valsad. More are planned.” WR said it vaccinates around 450 a day. An official said, “Vaccine hesitancy has been overcome to some extent as politicians as well as celebrities are publicising their doses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/frontline-risk-30-cops-best-staff-yet-to-get-jabs-in-mumbai/articleshow/81976967.cms||Somit Sen
---||Trichy||HC order on arrears: BDU may extend date to pay sem exam fee||Trichy: Bharathidasan University (BDU) is likely to extend the last date for paying examination fee for the upcoming semester examination in the wake of the observation of Madras high court against the state government decision to cancel arrear examination of students in arts and science colleges citing the Covid-19 pandemic. BDU plans to hold semester examination next month for students in its 150-odd non-autonomous affiliated colleges across 12 districts. While the last date for paying the examination fee ended on March 31, the high court’s observation may prompt students to appear for the semester examination to clear their arrear papers. It may be noted that following the government order (GO 125) that enabled students to pass arrear examinations, marks were given to the students based on their internal marks and previous semester examination marks. Since many students scored less marks and would want to improve their scores, BDU had conducted improvement examination for them last month. About 50,000 students appeared for the arrear papers out of which 30,000 could clear all of them. The remaining 20,000 will appear again in the semester examination scheduled for May to clear their arrears. There are about 5,000 students who have not written improvement exams and rely on the marks given by the college and university based on GO 125. Now that the high court is unlikely to recognise the GO, these students may want to appear for the exams in the ensuing semester exam. According to controller of examination S Srinivasaragavan, the last date to pay examination fee may be extended if request comes from students to appear for the arrear papers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/hc-order-on-arrears-bdu-may-extend-date-to-pay-sem-exam-fee/articleshow/81976975.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The procurement centres have been opened at Mayapuri, Narela and APMC Najafgarh Mandi. “A series of cutouts and banners are placed at the gates of APMC Najafgarh mandi as well as at the gates of Food Storage Depot at Narela and Mayapuri, inviting farmers to sell their produce at the determined MSP for wheat procurement of Rs 1,975 per quintal,” the FCI said. The FCI said the Delhi government had requested for opening of wheat procurement centres and they accepted their request. All three centres have been operational from April 1.

Sarabhai is the father of India’s space programme. Sharma,who was a part of the Indo-Soviet joint manned mission between April 3 and April 11, 1984, was participating in a nearly two-and-a-half hour webinar organised by the Russian House in Mumbai to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the world’s first manned mission by Yuri Gagarin. The historic mission that paved the way for manned flights took place on April 12, 1961. Though the programme was meant to highlight the achievement of Gagarin, who passed away in 1968, the focus was on Sharma with majority of the questions being directed towards him. Sharma said that when astronauts and cosmonauts work in space, they appreciate the value of planet Earth. “You miss the lack of social interaction and seeing greenery.

Later, reports in a section of the media said that a “powerful minister may join the Kejriwal-led party soon.” Maharaj told TOI, “In the last few days, I was busy campaigning for BJP in Darjeeling and other parts of West Bengal. I do not know how and why these rumours were spread. It appears that some people are trying to circulate false news to malign my image.” The tourism minister maintained that he has never met Kejriwal. “We have a lot to do for Uttarakhand.

As Mali facing severe mental torture during the crucial stage of pregnancy, her mother Sharda brought her to her home in Kalali. Just before the delivery of the fourth child, Sharda took Mali to her in-laws’ home at Sangma village in Padra and the two families reached a settlement. But when she delivered a baby girl, Babu and Ganga again started harassing her due to which Sharda had to go and visit her daughter several times. During one of her visits, Mali told her mother that time and again Ganga too used to ask her to consume poison to end her life. After the intervention of Mali’s mother, the situation would subside but would flare up again after a few days. On Wednesday afternoon, when the couple had a heated argument, Mali left home in anger. “Before leaving, she told her husband that she will jump in the canal and end her life. Despite her threat, no one in the house stopped her. In the evening, her body was found by the villagers in the canal,” said sub-inspector P T Jaiswal of Padra police station. “We will formally arrest them after the Covid tests,” said Jaiswal. The daughters are now with Sharda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/woman-tortured-for-not-bearing-male-child-ends-life/articleshow/81975671.cms||---

It was also told to decide the hierarchy structure of all such centres, which would have in-charge doctor or administrator and on-duty medical staff. These facilities would also act as transit care centres for serious patients who require immediate hospitalisation, but do not get admission and have to wait for the bed.Earlier, the commissioner-led panel said that it had taken a slew of decisions including approving Covid-19 hospital applications by the NMC within 24 hours and that Covid patients would be subjected to two types of tests — antigen and RT-PCR. The Sanjeev Kumar-led panel was entrusted to ensure adequate infrastructure at these centres that would have common toilets, proper supply of medicines and oxygen, and also to declare two helpline numbers for supply of medicines and equipment. It will also seek help from the Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA) and Indian Medical Association (IMA) for running these day-care centres. It will further ensure that doctors having qualifications like BAMS, DHMS and Ayush are deployed at these facilities. The panel was told to seek help from private hospitals to voluntarily spare their staff like doctors and nurses to work at these centres. It was told to procure material available at Radha Swami Satsang Hospital in Kalmeshwar, where a jumbo hospital was planned by the NMC earlier, but never materialized. The judges added Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) joint commissioner Dr Kose as a member of Nagpur Covid-19 Committee and made MADC and MPCB as new respondents.The bench further directed all private hospitals to scrupulously follow the criteria issued by the government for admitting Covid patients. The criteria in this regard would be found in the “Maharashtra Covid-19 Task Force recommendations for the management of hospitalised Covid-19 patients”, dated March 23. “These recommendations are available on the website of the state ministry of public health. However, these recommendations must be uploaded on the NMC website. Therefore, we direct the NMC commissioner to complete formalities by April 9,” the bench said.The bench further asked private hospitals to cooperate with GMCH teams when they would visit their premises for verifying patients’ numbers. “If the team comes across non-cooperation or resistance from any private hospital or any discrepancy in admissions, it should be brought to HC’s notice so that the issue of taking necessary action, including coercive one, would be considered,” the bench stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/start-day-care-centres-for-covid-patients-in-2-weeks-hc/articleshow/81975677.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

As the afternoon fire spread fast, Army jawans at Cantonment swung into action and launched a massive fire-fighting operation along with the fire department to stop the fire from spreading to nearby settlements. The reason behind the wildfire is yet to be ascertained, said officials, who didn’t rule out spontaneous combustion due to hot temperature. Chief executive officer, Bareilly Cantonment Board, Vivek Singh said, “The fire broke out in the forest area all of sudden. The reason what caused the fire is still unknown. Fortunately, the flame was put out by Army jawans with the support of fire-fighting teams. Fire tenders arrived timely and we had, too, deployed all fire-fighting equipment to control the fire. Fortunately, no loss of life was reported. We will assess the loss later. Besides, we will sensitise people living around the Cantonment area not to burn dry leaves as it can result in a forest fire.” Cantonment police station SHO Rajeev Kumar said, “We have asked nearby villagers to stay alert. The Cantonment Board has not filed a complaint in this connection, so far.” Meanwhile, videos and photos of Army jawans dousing the fire were widely shared on social media and Twitterati praised their effort.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/razing-fire-spread-in-forest-area-in-bareilly-army-jawans-put-out-blaze/articleshow/81974797.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

A vegetable vendor and a resident of New Bidipeth, the Covid patient’s oxygen saturation level had drastically depleted. He had deep lung infection and immediately required ventilator bed, which was not available in the city since Wednesday morning. “I saw VIPs, journalists, politicians and common people throwing their weight but couldn’t get their patients admitted to medical colleges and private hospitals. Around 2am, my uncle asked me to rush for Warangal where he had secured a bed in a private hospital,” said Abhimanyu, 21, who works in an IT company in Nagpur. The ambulance reached Warangal at 11.30am and Abhimanyu’s father was immediately rushed to the ICU where he is battling for life. A prominent fleet owner told TOI that at least five patients died in ambulances as they couldn’t get a bed for hours. “Last night was ‘Qayamat ki raat’. Some left for Sawangi, Wardha, Seoni, and other states. We have a list of 100 patients waiting at home for beds,” said Dr Abhishek Rana who operates a fleet of ambulances. Dr Rana said there is no space either in private or government hospitals for Covid patients. “Those who survived were dropped off at their homes and oxygen support was arranged,” he said. He further said that around 50 ambulances, including 15 belonging to him, were on calls in the city in the night. According to him, another patient died on Thursday morning in ambulance. “The patient was brought from Chhindwara to Ramdaspeth. When he reached, the bed was allotted to someone else,” he said. NGO HelpForGood’s Gagandeep Singh Vij, who helps citizens find beds, said he had received around three to four queries, including Abhimanyu’s, late on Wednesday night. “All were for ICU and ventilator beds but we couldn’t arrange for anyone. One patient left for Bhandara but when he reached there, the bed was occupied,” he said. Dr Rana said relatives are now looking for options out of the city. Management consultant Amjad Khan was searching a bed for his 57-year-old aunt since Wednesday night. On Thursday evening, his aunt was still at home. “Remdesivir is not available anywhere and no hospital has a Covid bed. How does a patient survive at home?” he said. Vidarbha Hospital Association convener Dr Anup Marar said it is a distressing situation for all healthcare service providers as relatives are agitated because of lack of ICU beds, dialysis beds and Remdesivir. “Hospitals are overwhelmed with admission calls, and both sets of RT-PCR positive and negative Covid like presentations with dearth of oxygen and Remdesivir,” he said. Dipti (name changed), a resident of Dattareya Nagar, said the private hospital where her uncle was admitted had asked them to shift him since the infection was deep and he needed a ventilator which was not available. Similarly, there were countless calls and queries from relatives and friends of Covid positive patients who need urgent hospitalization but had to wait. Shockingly, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) didn’t release its daily bed vacancy chart. Civic and district authorities didn’t answer to TOI’s calls and messages regarding the problems faced by citizens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/youth-drives-covid-ve-father-to-warangal-hosp-on-deadly-night/articleshow/81976989.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Trichy||Covid-19: Tamil Nadu adopts 4-pronged strategy to arrest second surge||The core committee for prevention and management of Covid-19 headed by chief secretary Rajeev Ranjan ruled out chances of a complete lockdown in Tamil Nadu, but planned scaling down of indoor non-essential activities. On Thursday, health secretary J Radhakrishnan, in an interview to TOI, said the directorate of public health has worked out four strategies to aggressively rein in the pandemic curve in Tamil Nadu. Testing aggressively: Early identification of positive cases with aggressive testing will aid early isolation, treatment and prevent transmission and deaths. The state’s new target is to reduce the test positivity rate below 5 in all high incidence districts and below 1 in low incidence districts. On an average the state now tests 85,000 people, which will go up to a lakh in 10 days. Vaccine ramp up: After vaccinating about 1.2 lakh people a day, the recipient numbers in TN came down drastically in the last one week as most health workers were posted as polling staff. The state is targetting 3 lakh vaccinations – first and second dose included – a day across the state. The state has so far received 54.85 lakh doses of vaccines, with a stock of nearly 17 lakh doses. Enforcing protocols: While fever camps will be held across the state, corporations and local bodies will hold door-to-door surveillance in containment areas. A building with three households and a street with three houses will be declared a containment area in cities. Health authorities have been asked to track down at least 30 contacts of positive cases within 72 hrs. Those violating home isolation will be moved to Covid care centres. The state will also fine people sans masks or those who fail to maintain social distancing. Health officials, police and revenue officials can levy penalties on violations under the TN Public Health Act. Triaging patients: As cases continue to increase, hospitals in high incidence districts are filling up quickly. While people will have access to a number of beds in private hospitals through the health department webpage (https://stopcorona.tn.gov.in/, screening centres at various PHCs and emergency units in hospital will triage patient and send them to covid care centres, health centres or government medical college hospitals for primary, secondary and tertiary care. This will ensure patients do not crowd one facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/tn-adopts-4-pronged-strategy-to-arrest-2nd-surge/articleshow/81976985.cms||---

But all the ice cream seller Nandkishore Gupta will get to contend himself with will be a bench which the police had seized as muddamaal!. Last week, a court here acquitted four persons, accused of committing the theft and torching Gupta’s and another man’s food cart. As the accused never appeared for the trial and the prosecution too could not produce any evidence to convict them, they were acquitted by the court. On the intervening nights of September 4 and 5 in 1990, Ashok Vaghri, Raju Vaghri, Amrut Vaghri and Mukesh Vaghri allegedly stole Rs 4,200 cash and ice cream from Gupta’s hand cart and Rs 10,000 from Hasan Kaasam’s hand cart near Sursagar pond and later torched the carts. Gupta had lodged a complaint and the investigating officer had filed a chargesheet against the four accused after 10 days. The court had issued summons to the four accused, but they never turned up, so the trial continued in their absence. During the trial too, the prosecution could not furnish any strong evidence implicating the accused and key witnesses including Kasam too did not turn up for examination. Due to the absence of the accused and the witnesses, and since the case was not heading anywhere, Gupta filed a pursis (a written statement) to withdraw the case. The court of additional chief judicial magistrate D J Parmar noted that the prosecution could not prove the charges against the accused and the pursis filed by Gupta acquitted them. The court also ordered that Gupta’s bench which was seized by police almost 31 years ago be returned to him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/awaiting-justice-ice-cream-seller-gets-a-bench-after-30-yrs/articleshow/81975713.cms||Jay Pachchigar

State drug controller Dr Ritu Sahay said, “We are regulating the supply of the drug, like we did during the first wave, to make sure that it reaches those who are in dire need of it and to eliminate any kind of black marketing. We are keeping a track on the availability of the drug and the requirements put forward by the healthcare facilities and distributing it accordingly.” Explaining how the regulating and tracking system works, Dr Sahay said, “As soon as we saw the fresh surge in cases, we prepared two Google Sheets -- one contained the details of the stocks available and the other contained details of the patients being treated at the various Covid care centres. This helped us in identifying the exact requirement and the stocks we are receiving. Every morning, all of our drug inspectors go through the requirements put forward by the Covid care centres and check the available stock and then direct the suppliers to provide the drug to the hospital concerned.” Asked if the state is facing any scarcity of the drug, Dr Sahay said, “The whole country is experiencing a shortage and we are trying our best to ensure that it is available to everyone. I have held meetings with representatives of GOI, the pricing control authorities and leading manufacturers and I am in constant touch with them in this regard. On several occasions, we have placed orders in advance to make sure that the state gets its share of the drug within the stipulated time-frame.” She added, “We have already asked the manufacturers to increase the supply for Remdesivir. Besides, we are also monitoring the supply of other essential drugs like docycycline, Ivermectine and other anti-coagulators and we have those drugs available in plenty.” Critical care expert and director of Medica Hospital Dr Vijay Mishra said, “Given the surge in cases, Remdesivir is likely to go off the markets, like it did during the first wave. But we are getting an optimum supply of the drug at the moment and are putting it to good use.” Rims trauma centre head and professor of critical care Dr Pradeep Bhattacharya said, “Not every Covid patient needs Remdesivir as there are other drugs available to treat the viral infection. Having said that, we are experiencing a shortage of Remdesivir, which is normal given the current spike in cases, but there hasn’t been an acute scarcity yet.” Besides Remdesivir, any facility which is treating Covid patients needs to have sufficient oxygen supply and according to Dr Sahay, Jharkhand is a surplus manufacturer of it. “We have 17 manufacturers of medical oxygen in the state. Apart from supplying to the state hospitals, we are providing medical oxygen to neighbouring states like Orissa, West Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jkhand-prepares-for-rainy-day-regulates-remdesivir-supply/articleshow/81976018.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||Amid 2nd wave, migrants return home in J’khand||RANCHI: Govind Kumar is a resident of Bagodar block in Giridih district. For nearly five years now, Govind has been working at a coffee shop in Mumbai’s Worli to sustain his family back home. Govind earns nearly Rs 30,000 a month, of which he can send a little back home. On Thursday, Govind doled out a chunk of his salary to purchase air tickets to the state. With Maharashtra announcing night curfews and lockdowns during the weekends in a desperate effort to tame the spiralling Covid-19 infection rate, Govind’s employers have downed the shutters indefinitely. “Night curfews are in place till April 30, so my employer asked me to go home. He said he will summon me once situations ease out,” Govind said outside Ranchi’s Birsa Munda International Airport upon arrival. Govind is not alone. Anil Kumar Mahto, a native of Hazaribag’s Ichak block, also arrived at the airport from Bengaluru. A carpenter working at a furniture store, Mahto’s employers gave him the marching orders under similar circumstances. “After sitting at home for months, I returned to work just before Diwali. And now, my job has become uncertain again,” Mahto rued after arriving at the Ranchi airport. With several big cities imposing curbs, night curfews and lockdowns to tackle the second wave of Covid-19, Jharkhand is beginning to witness a reverse migration. Each day, hundreds of migrants are returning to Ranchi and other parts of the state from Maharashtra, Punjab, Delhi and Telangana and dispersing to their homes amid an uncertain future. Akram Ansari, a cab driver based in Ranchi’s Hindpiri, has been ferrying migrant workers from Chhattisgarh. “Only last week, I drove back five workers from Raipur in my car to Ranchi. They paid me Rs 13,000. There are many others like them who are hiring vehicles and arriving at the state’s borders after their employers asked them to leave,”Ansari told TOI. For Surendra Singh, a salon worker in Navi Mumbai, it is a waiting game. “I want to return to Mumbai because there is no work here,” Singh, a native of Giridih, said. “But if the situation doesn’t improve in Maharashtra, I will be forced to look for work as my savings will dry up by then,” he said. While the state government had vowed to create a database of incoming migrants during the lockdown and provide them local employments, the idea did not materialise. As per estimates, nearly six lakh msigrant workers had returned to their homes in Jharkhand last year. When contacted to know the government’s response, state labour minister Satyanand Bhokta’s office said he was campaigning in Madhupur. State labour commissioner A Muthukumar is camping in West Bengal’s Nadia district as an election observer. “We are keeping an eye on the inflow of workers during the second wave,” an official in the labour department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/amid-2nd-wave-migrants-return-home-in-jkhand/articleshow/81975864.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Hearing a suo moto public interest litigation (PIL), a division bench of Chief Justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad used the term to describe the lackadaisical approach of Rims in procuring the machine. The bench ordered the director of the autonomous healthcare institute to submit an application on Thursday itself to the government for the purchase of a CT scan machine. The HC has listed the matter for hearing again on Friday. Rims has been functioning without a scanning machine and patients have to conduct their scans in private hospitals and radiology centres. Their reports are then shown to the doctors of Rims for evaluation and treatment. Several news reports had already highlighted the matter. The HC took suo moto cognisance of the news reports in local dailies and issued notices to the Rims administration and the state government on the matter. The court was also informed that several pathological tests were not conducted in the hospital. Earlier, the court had issued notices to the state health department secretary, seeking an explanation on the irregularities and the lack of services at Rims. The department had assured the court that all irregularities existing in the hospital will be removed for smooth operation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/shameful-that-rims-has-no-ct-scan-jkhand-hc/articleshow/81976033.cms||---

The transgender, noted social activist Amruta Soni (38), will be a member of the NLA’s bench number 19 which also comprises a judge and a panel lawyer. Hailing from Sholapur district in Maharashtra, Soni completed graduation from the Jamia Milia University in 2007 and did MBA in marketing from the Symbiosis Institute in Pune. While growing up, Soni had to beg on the streets and was a former sex worker. Later, she worked as a nodal officer with project Vihaan which provided help to HIV-infected persons in Chhattisgarh. Soni is currently associated with the non-profit non-government organisation, TRY, which runs hospitals with the help of the tribal welfare department in Jharkhand. TRY is also working for female sex workers. DLSA secretary Abhishek Kumar said, “Soni is the first transgender selected for the NLA bench in the state and selected based on her experience and works. The step would help ensure rights and respect to the transgenders in society.” He said the executive chairman of Jharkhand Legal Service Authority Justice, Aparesh Kumar Singh, has given directions to take up measures to bring the transgenders and the sex workers into the social mainstream. DLSA also believes that with this step, more people from the neglected groups would come forward before the administration with their problems, he added. On her selection, Soni said she would try to ensure justice in matters which comes up before her bench. She said society may have despised her but she will not do the same. “Many sex workers have expressed happiness over my selection in the bench saying now they would not have to struggle for justice. Several of them plan to come to the court and watch me,” Soni said. It may be noted here that a total of 57 benches, including 29 for judicial officers and 18 for administrative officials, have been formed for the NLA. Notices have been sent by courts to 6,000 litigants for the lok adalat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/in-jharkhands-first-transgender-to-be-part-of-natl-lok-adalat-bench/articleshow/81976952.cms||Sanjay Sahay

In Bokaro, the district authorities stopped the drive after it ran out of vaccine stock. As the centres remained shut in Jamshedpur, many beneficiaries, including senior citizens, were seen standing outside the hot sun to enquire about the fresh stocks and their turn to get the jabs. On the vaccine shortage, a senior official of the district health department, Dr Sahir Paul, said, "We have placed orders for the vaccine and there is no way now other than waiting for the supply from the state headquarters." Among the beneficiaries who returned empty-handed are Sishir Mukherjee and his wife Sabita, both in the mid-eighties, were standing disappointed at the Sonari community health centre. The couple, who lived one at their Sonari house as their only son is in the US, said they were suffering from various ailments and had a difficult time coming to the vaccination centre. Sishir said, "The government should have some responsibility towards the senior citizens. They should use the public address system to announce the availability of the vaccine so that we do not face such hardships in this sizzling 40°C. In other centres, too, there was a heavy rush of people to get the vaccine shot." He also lamented that the government did not keep its promise of setting up the centres at every two kilometres. Similarly, Supriya Jha (75), who was suffering from cancer, had to wait for a long time at the Steel City Nursing Home in Bistupur before being turned away citing lack of vaccine. She said, "I had taken so much trouble to reach the centre but I was turned away." Rontu Das, a retired bank employee, complained that at many centres, those who want to get vaccinated but not registered in the Arogya Sethu app were not allowed to get the registration done for the vaccination. He said, "When everyone in the country does not have smartphones, it is impossible to get the registrations done through apps. The government should clarify on this matter." Meanwhile, over 5,000 people assembled at aground near Kasidih to watch a cricket match on Wednesday night. The incident happened when the administration was trying to tighten the loose ends to bring the pandemic under control by making surprise checks at busy public places. The PCR vans nearby remained a mute spectator to the entire incident. The grim situation of the vaccination drive is also witnessed in Bokaro with the district authorities admitting that they have run out of vaccines. Civil surgeon Dr A K Pathak said, “We were forced to shut vaccination centres today due to lack of supplies. A message has been sent to the state health department requesting fresh stock.” Pathak said barring a couple of session sites in rural areas, most of the 64 vaccination sites in the district remained closed on Thursday. These included two dozen private hospitals in the city and in the suburbs. Bablu Agarwal, a city-based businessman who returned from a session site without getting vaccinated, said outside the ANM vaccination centre in Camp-2, “I came to get vaccinated, but the centre is closed saying there is no vaccine left.” The district administration, however, has intensified testing and setting up new containment zones. As on Thursday evening, there were 23 containment zones across the district and the number of Covid cases was 7,191. The district had 272 active cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/short-of-hope-2-industrial-cities-run-out-of-covid-vaccine-stock/articleshow/81983030.cms||Divy Khare

Addressing mediapersons on Thursday, deputy commissioner Aditya Kumar Anand said he has issued orders in this regard to civil surgeon Dr Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal. He also admitted that there is a shortage of vaccine doses. Anand further said safety protocols will be strictly implemented in the district and violations, including attempts to take out religious processions, will be strictly dealt with. He said, “On an average, around 1,500 samples are being tested daily. But with the rising cases, we must increase the number of tests. We have given the necessary directions in this regard. At present, there are six sample collection centres where all tests are done through RT-PCR and TruNat machines.” Stating that most of the cases are reported from the Hazaribag town, the DC said the new hotspot towns are Babugaon, Hurhuru, Holy Cross, Boddom Bazar, Ravindra Path and Jheel Tower areas. “Residents have to shed their casual attitude and observe the Covid-19 protocols religiously, otherwise we have to initiate more stringent rules,” he said.

Union railway minister Piyush Goyal via video conferencing from New Delhi inaugurated the 32-km-long railway line, built at a cost of Rs 550 crore. He also flagged off the new train, which left Godda at 3 pm and is slated to arrive at New Delhi in 24 hours. Mahagama MLA Deepika Pandey Singh, transport minister Champai Soren and Yadav attended the event. A bunch of JMM and Congress supporters allegedly barged into Godda station and carried party flags to make their presence known. Dubey, who was invited by the Railways and was present at the station for the flag-off, also boarded the train for its onward journey to the national capital. Although it is not known what led to the tussle between the two, Dubey and Yadav exchanged heated words and in a video, which later started doing rounds on social media, both were seen trying to land blows at each other as their bodyguards and police officers tried to shield them away from each other’s ranges. Dubey accused Yadav, Singh and Soren of hijacking the event. He also accused the Godda administration of being a mute spectator and not dispensing its duties to enforce the April 6 order passed by the state government which prohibits public gatherings. “I underwent a Covid-19 test before attending the event and only attended after I tested negative. But the lawmakers from the ruling alliance violated the guidelines, arrived here with hundreds of supporters and even tried to harm me,” Dubey said. While Yadav could not be contacted, Singh tried to downplay the scuffle. “Unruly scenes or not, the event is a matter of great joy for the people of Santhal-Pargana.” She deflected questions on the alleged violation of Covid-19 guidelines. A statement issued by the Railways quoted Goyal as saying: “The Hansdiha-Godda project was approved in 2011, however, no progress was made until 2014. Till date, this project has attracted an investment of Rs 550 crore. With this new Hansdiha-Godda Rail line, the area would develop at a faster pace generating more employment opportunities in future. A Kisan rail may be started to transport the farmers’ produce from this area.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-mp-cong-mla-scuffle-at-train-inaugural-event-in-jkhand/articleshow/81975674.cms||---
---||Ranchi||25% beds to be reserved for Cov patients across pvt hosps in Ranchi||RANCHI: State health minister Banna Gupta on Thursday said the government will not hesitate in taking action against those private healthcare facilities which are unwilling cooperate with the state in its fight against Covid-19. Gupta’s remarks came after representatives of a few private hospitals in Ranchi did not turn up for a high-level meeting held at the Institute of Public Health in Namkum to review the Covid-19 situation in Jharkhand despite the health minister inviting them. “I have directed the MD of National Health Mission (NHM) to issue a show-cause notice to those who didn’t turn up for today’s meeting. I have also directed senior officials to conduct a surprise inspection of such hospitals and if they are found flouting government norms, they will be booked under the Disaster Management Act, 2005,” Gupta said after the meeting. The high-level meeting, which was presided over by Gupta, was attended by state health secretary K K Soan, NHM’s MD Ravishankar Shukla and a few representatives of private hospitals. They discussed issues like increasing the number of beds, ensuring availability of essential medicines and the current status of the vaccination drive. Gupta said, “We are trying to establish a coordination among the state-run and private healthcare facilities to work together during such tough times. After detailed a discussion at the meeting, we have decided that all private hospitals in Ranchi will reserve 25% of their beds for Covid patients. They have also been asked to display the number of beds available and the government-regulated tariff at their facilities and that needs to be shared with the district administration every six hours.” Asked about the less number of ventilator beds available in Ranchi, Gupta said, “Only 10% of the total Covid patients require ventilator, the rest can be treated with the help of oxygen support and medicines. Right now we are focussing on treating that 90% and the number of ventilator beds will be increased gradually.” Meanwhile, the private hospitals’ representatives suggested ways to reduce the mortality rate and to monitor the asymptomatic patients properly. “Regular monitoring and providing medical kits to asymptomatic patients, who are in home isolation, will help us in reducing the patient load in hospitals. It will also help in giving a boost to such patients’ confidence,” Yogesh Gambhir, the president (Jharkhand chapter) of Association of Private Healthcare Providers India, said. Shukla assured the private hospitals of full co-operation and requested them to keep beds ready for the critical Covid patients. “I have assured the private hospitals of all help and if needed, the state government will provide them with medical oxygen,” he said. Following the meeting, as many as 10 private hospitals across Ranchi were asked to increase their number of beds for Covid patients in order to comply with the 25% reservation order and accordingly, Devkamal hospital, Seva Sadan, Medanta, Samford, Pulse, Rampyari and others have altogether added 172 beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/25-beds-to-be-reserved-for-cov-patients-across-pvt-hosps-in-ranchi/articleshow/81975663.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Goa||CM: Mining corp before May 30||Panaji: The Goa Mining Corporation “will be functional before May 30”, chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Thursday. The deadline was fixed at a meeting held with secretaries to discuss the implementation of the budget. Four days ago, Sawant had told TOI that “the government will come out with an ordinance soon” for the setting up of the corporation. A bill will be introduced in the assembly in July, he had said. TOI had reported that the state government has decided to issue an ordinance to resume mining activities through the auction route. Sawant had announced the setting up of the corporation in his budget speech. “The government will sign an MoU with the Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd (MECL)... And that will help the state government start the process for e-auction,” Sawant had said. Mining in Goa came to a halt three years ago following the decision of the Supreme Court to quash the second renewal of 88 mining leases. While it’s currently unknown if the industry will restart this financial year, Sawant has set a target of mopping up Rs 550 crore from the industry. Of the state’s 40 constituencies, ten have substantial areas dependent on mining, four in South Goa — Sanvordem, Curchorem, Sanguem and Quepem — and six in North Goa — Poriem, Valpoi, Bicholim, Sakhali, Mayem and Tivim. Eight of these are represented by BJP MLAs. Two mining companies have approached the apex court seeking an extension of the mining leases till 2037. The companies had filed special leave petition after the high court of Bombay at Goa dismissed their petitions challenging the Goa, Daman and Diu (Abolition and Declaration of Mining Leases) Act, 1987. State government had told the SC that the mining companies had made a representation to the mines department contending that under the amendment to Section 8 A of the Mines and Minerals Development Act, they are entitled to extend their leases up to 2037, but that it will abide by the court’s decision. The state government has filed a review petition in the apex court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-mining-corp-before-may-30/articleshow/81977152.cms||---

She would not be intimidated by show-cause notices, the Bengal CM added, seeking to know how many complaints the EC had got against PM Narendra Modi’s “communal and divisive speeches”. Modi had slammed Mamata for her comments, saying he would have got “eight to 10 notices from the EC” had he asked Hindus to unite and vote for BJP. The EC notice to Mamata came on Wednesday, 24 hours after the PM’s comments. “You all voted for BJP last time. But what has it done other than spreading violence and lies? A cylinder of cooking gas now costs Rs 950. Tell them that you don’t want Rs 1,000 for going to BJP rallies or Rs 500 for casting your vote for BJP; in stead, ask them to give you cooking gas free,” she said, pointing out how India’s economy had slid under the BJP’s watch.

The CM held up Trinamool Balagarh candidate Manoranjan Byapari as an example of someone who had come up from the grassroots. “He is the chairman of the Dalit Sahitya Academy.

---||Goa||Travel and Tourism Association of Goa calls for arrest of protesting taxi operators for threatening govt||PANAJI: Tourist stakeholders other than taxi operators said that if the government gave in to the demand of the latter and scraped the app-based taxi service, it would be unjust and unreasonable. They have demanded strict action against tourist taxi operators for threatening the government. President of Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) Nilesh Shah said that the taxi drivers who are threatening the government should be arrested. “Put them behind bars. The government must take strict action against them for threatening. Transport service available in the state is not for tourists alone, locals too avail of it,” Shah said. In this age and time of Covid-19, when businesses and activities have tuned into the online mode, having an an-app based taxi service is a necessity, stakeholders said. “If the government bows before their demand, it will be a step backward,” director of First Class Holidays Atish Fernandes said. Hotelier Ralf de Souza said they (taxi owners) are asking to shut down an entity that has been doing business legally. “In this country, if anyone is doing business legally, he can’t be stopped. The government will not be able to revoke the app-based taxi service,” de Souza said. He said people are opting for an app-based taxi because there is a certainty of fare. “If taxis have meters consumers will have a sense of comfort. This is what differentiates app-based taxis from other taxis operated without digital meters,” de Souza said. Partner of Paradise Cruises Akash Madgavkar said that the government must take a strong stand against those protesting by congregating at Azad Maidan when the state is witnessing a rise in Covid-19 cases. Those in the tourism trade felt that when the industry is suffering overall due to the pandemic, this type of action by one segment of the industry will deal them a further blow. “When sentiments are not favorable, this type of attitude of taxi operators will kill the industry unless the government steps in and takes action against them. Hotels are facing cancellations of bookings due to a rise in cases. The app-based taxi service should be promoted. When the PM speaks of digitalisation it is not of currency alone, but he also means digitalisation of businesses. The government must act strictly against the taxi operators who are threatening,” Shah said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ttag-calls-for-arrest-of-protesting-taxi-operators-for-threatening-govt/articleshow/81977313.cms||Bindiya Chari
