---||Kolkata||As COVID 2.0 takes a toll on F&B biz, food delivery services back in demand||The food and beverage industry, which was severely hit by the first wave of COVID-19, finally embarked on the road to recovery in January as the city reported a dip in new cases. However, the green shoots remained short-lived as the second wave of the pandemic is back to haunt restaurateurs and cafe owners. Sudesh Poddar, president of Hotel and Restaurants Association of Eastern India, said, “Until last week, the F&B industry was recording around 85-90% business activity. Restaurant owners were breathing a sigh of relief as they started recovering last year’s losses. But from last Monday, the sale has again dropped to 50% as a result of the second wave. With so many new cases being reported every day, people are back in panic and avoiding dining out. Takeaway business, too, has reduced by 30% as people are again wary of having outside food.” Many restaurants shut down after succumbing to the losses incurred during the first nationwide lockdown. “Restaurant owners are once again staring at uncertainty as they await fresh COVID guidelines by the state government. Another lockdown or a night curfew would serve as the final nail in the coffin for the F&B industry,” he added. While the demand for dine-out facilities continues to fall, tiffin services and home deliveries are seeing a rise in enquiries. Won’t survive another lockdown: RestaurantsAnirban Sengupta from What’s Up! Café informed that since last week, their sales have dropped by 30-40%. “We’re afraid it will go down further if there’s no improvement in the COVID situation. People are naturally tense and unwilling to dine out. We are still better off than other restaurants who do not have an open area, which is a top preference in COVID times,” he said. Dalia De from BOWLOUT, Daily Bhoj and Asian Deli said apart from the fear of getting infected, many people are not dining out to curb expenses. “The pandemic fear has again gripped people’s minds like last year. Just when things started looking up, the second wave came as a big blow to us. People are unsure about their future and spending on restaurants can be an added burden. However, our food delivery business is still not affected,” she said. Echoing similar sentiments, Marbella’s owner Nikhil Chawla said, “Our business is facing one of its worst phases. Customers are going back to the last lockdown trend of eating in their own cars rather than dining in the cafe. Thankfully, the demand for takeaway services has increased as people feel it’s safer to order in and enjoy their food at home.” Sayantan Saha from Kareem’s said they had started recovering losses made during the first lockdown from November onwards, but the second wave has taken them “ten steps back” in terms of business. “Since last week, there is a 30-40% dip in our sale. Very few customers are opting to dine out. Even our takeaway service is not doing great. We still don’t know what new guidelines will be announced after the election results on May 2. So, we are living in highly uncertain times,” he said. The uncertainty over fresh government directives likely to be announced after poll results is making many restaurant owners jittery. “For the past 20-25 days, our sale has already dropped by 30-40% as people are hardly stepping out. If another lockdown or night curfew is declared, we won’t be able to survive,” said Sohon Saha from The Spirits. The fall of dine in, return of order in Like last year, several families have again started confining themselves to their homes and restricting the entry of domestic help who use public transport and work at multiple houses. These families are now banking on home deliveries for their meal requirements. People are not just ordering a la carte, but booking daily meals in advance. There are cases where the entire family is getting affected and there is no one to even place orders. There are family members who live in different parts of the country and have been booking meals for their parents and families back home, giving the home delivery business a major boost. Amrita Das from Abcos Food Plaza said, “The demand for takeaway and delivery has increased by 30%. We’ve added more options to our menu on food delivery apps so that customers get a better variety. Besides, we also have customers who get their daily meals from us as they are avoiding fish and vegetable markets. We even customise the food on request.” Turni Dhar from Dependablez – an organisation that looks after the welfare of elderly citizens whose children are settled outside the city – runs two cloud kitchens. “When we started last year, we used to cater to 15 families in the south and 10 families in the north. These were mostly senior citizens. As the situation improved, many of them stopped buying meals as their domestic help joined back,” she said. With the surge in daily cases, the demand for her home delivery service has again gone up considerably. “Of late, I am getting calls from people residing in Canada and America. They request us to deliver meals to their elderly parents living here, who are either COVID positive or unable to manage without maids. The demand is so high that we are having to refuse a lot of orders,” Turni added. Tamal Roy from RosoighoReR Rohosyo said when things were going back to normal between November and February, the demand for their home-cooked daily meals started decreasing. But the second wave has pushed up the demand yet again. “Our sale is already up by 15-20%. Multiple factors like the fear of dining out, people refusing their domestic help from coming home and all family members falling sick together have led to a significant rise in demand for food delivery. They have no option but to depend on us for daily meals, even breakfast.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/as-covid-2-0-takes-a-toll-on-fb-biz-food-delivery-services-back-in-demand/articleshow/82130345.cms||Ruman Ganguly
---||Goa||Goa have a fantastic goalkeeper: Al Wahda coach||PANAJI: FC Goa goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh’s performance in the goalless draw against Al Wahda received a lot of praise, including from the UAE side’s Dutch head coach Henk ten Cate. “They (Goa) have a fantastic goalkeeper or you can say we missed too many easy chances and we should have won this game. Unfortunately, it’s just a draw. The first half we were sloppy with the passing. But we got better in the second half. In the first half, we had two or three very good chances and we should have scored,” said ten Cate after Saturday’s goalless AFC Champions League battle against the hosts at the Nehru Stadium, Fatorda. The former Indian U-17 World Cupper brought up a number of crucial saves, including an added time block to frustrate Syrian striker Omar Khrbin. “In the second half, these decent chances you cannot miss. You can say it is decent goalkeeping, but the chances were not the only one. We had two or three. If you score 50 percent of the chances, then it’s a good score. We should have scored at least one goal,” said the former Barcelona assistant coach. Just like other visiting teams, the former Ajax coach is finding it challenging to get acclimatised to the weather conditions, that too during the Ramzan when Muslims refrain from food and drink during daylight. “It’s really affecting your body; you lose a lot of sweat and you keep constantly drinking, but your energy levels go down. You have to make changes which doesn’t benefit the game and team,” said the coach. Persepolis (Iran) and Al Rayyan (Qatar) are also clubs from Islamic countries like Al Wahda, but ten Cate doesn’t want to give any excuses. He has now set his sights on doing well in the remaining four games. “There is always room for improvement in the passing game and finishing. This is what we must talk to our players and keep our heads up. Four matches are still left, and we have a chance. It's just a draw and we didn’t lose. We are still in it,” said the 66-year-old.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-have-a-fantastic-goalkeeper-al-wahda-coach/articleshow/82133782.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

Austin police, calling the situation "an active shooting incident," said they were searching for a suspect. "While a suspect is still at large, it appears this is a domestic situation that is isolated and there is no risk to the general public," Austin police said on Twitter. The shooting occurred near a popular shopping area in the northwest part of the city, which is the capital of Texas. Police know the identity of the gunman, according to a report by KVUE-TV in Austin. Austin-Travis county emergency medical services department said three "adult patients" were dead at the scene of the shooting, which was reported shortly before noon, local time. "No additional patients have been reported or located at this time," the department said on Twitter about an hour after the incident was first reported. Police urged residents to avoid the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/at-least-three-people-reported-dead-in-austin-texas-shooting/articleshow/82134287.cms||---
---||World||Islamists clash with cops, many feared dead||ISLAMABAD: A number of workers of the proscribed far-right Islamist party, Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), were feared dead and several others injured in Lahore in clashes with police after the protesters tortured a deputy superintendent of police (DSP) and took him, as well as four other officials, hostage on Sunday. Police said the violence occurred after the protesters attacked a police station and abducted the DSP. “Today in the early morning, ‘miscreants’ [TLP workers] attacked Nawankot police station where rangers and police officers were trapped inside the police station and DSP Nawankot kidnapped and taken in the markaz [referring to TLP headquarters],” the Punjab Police posted on Twitter. It claimed that TLP workers have also taken an oil tanker containing 50,000 litres of petrol to their headquarters. “The miscreants were armed and attacked rangers/police with petrol bombs. Police and rangers pushed them back and took back the possession of the police station. Police did not plan or conducted any operation against the mosque or the madrassa. The action, if any, was in self defence and to protect public property (sic),” the statement further read. A TLP spokesperson said the clash started when police launched an operation to clear the area around Lahore’s Yateem Khana Chowk, where workers of the banned party have been staging a protest since earlier this week, following the arrest of their 26 year old leader, Saad Hussain Rizvi. “We will bury those killed when the French ambassador is expelled from the country and our agreement with the government is implemented,” TLP spokesperson Shafiq Ameeni said in a video message. The TLP workers wielding sticks and stones also climbed atop the Orange Line Metro Train, while calls for support were being made to people from the mosque in the area. In a short video doing the rounds on social media, the Nawankot police station DSP, who identified himself as Mohammad Umer Farooq, can be seen appealing to the government to resolve the matter through dialogue. The DSP, presumably under duress, narrated the events that led up to him being taken hostage, telling the government that it should “honour” the agreement if one was reached between the two parties. “Three people to my right have so far been martyred whereas scores are injured,” Farooq said before he requested the government to try and resolve the situation amicably. “We are all Muslims, and our common enemy is France who committed blasphemy,” the DSP said in the video. TLP was formally banned by the federal government earlier this week after its supporters staged three days of violent protests across the country, resulting in deaths and injuries to several policemen. Founded by firebrand cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi, who had died last year in November, TLP has agitated for several years over the issue of perceived blasphemy, holding mass demonstrations across the country calling for all “blasphemers” to be killed. The party rose to further prominence after the country’s 2018 general election, when it secured the fourth-highest vote share.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/islamists-clash-with-cops-many-feared-dead/articleshow/82134412.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The State Executive Committee issued the guidelines after Lieutenant Governor (LG) Manoj Sinha chaired a high-level meeting in Jammu and reviewed the Covid-19 situation in J&K. “The State Executive Committee, in exercise of the powers conferred upon it under Section 24 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, hereby orders that all universities and colleges in J&K shall remain closed for imparting on-campus and in-person education to the students till May 15, 2021,” the order said. However, the order made it clear that colleges and universities shall remain open for courses or programmes that require “physical presence of students on account of laboratory, research, thesis work and internship”. “Colleges will move to online mode and schools across J&K shall continue to remain closed for imparting on-campus and in-person education to students till May15, 2021,” read the order. “The ceiling on the number of people permitted to attend gatherings and functions related to funerals shall be 20, 50 for all kinds of gatherings at indoor venues and 100 for outdoor venues,” the order said. In case of public transport, it said: “Matadors, buses, mini-buses and other modes of public transport shall ply strictly as per their registered and authorized seating capacity; no standing of commuters will be allowed.” All district SPs have been asked to ensure that the guidelines are strictly complied with and punitive measures are taken in case of violation. “The existing guideline for compulsory testing of all incoming passengers to J&K shall be strongly enforced… they will have to compulsorily undergo a Covid-19 antigen test,” it said. The order further stated that all district magistrates shall put in place an effective mechanism to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour in all crowded markets, shopping complexes and malls. While reviewing Covid-19 management and control efforts in J&K, the LG instructed officers to achieve 100% coverage under the Ayushman Bharat-SEHAT scheme, besides making serious efforts to intensify vaccination in their respective districts. He also directed Deputy Commissioner, Srinagar, to ramp up efforts to increase vaccination of the age-appropriate categories and involve prominent religious leaders, sportspersons and public figures to sensitize the public for getting vaccinated for one’s own safety and safety of others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amid-covid-surge-jammu-and-kashmir-orders-closure-of-all-educational-institutions-till-may-15/articleshow/82134438.cms||M Saleem Pandit

However, in the wake of the recent permit to allow food deliveries to take place 24X7, city folks are doing a lot of late-night ordering, and most times, it’s around the midnight hour. The work-from-home routine (WFH) seems to be one of the factors spurring the trend, but it’s not the only one. The city is also glued to the ongoing cricket tournament or bingeing on a fave TV show, which often has them ordering for nocturnal snacks that they settle down to enjoy in front of their screens.  What’s fuelling the trendQuite a few city-goers are hitting food order apps to satiate themselves. Andheri-based corporate executive Tarun Poonia, says, “The cricket matches are on and my friends have been sharing pics of these home-cooked snacks on our group chat. Since I stay alone, I skipped dinner and just ordered out for this customised game night snack-box and it was fun to try it. Since we can order late now, I also plan to make a late order of cake or ice-cream for my friend’s birthday and send it over to surprise her, so she can ring in her birthday with it.” Pic credit: iStockFor some, the late indulgence marks some chill-out relaxation. Shivali Mehta, a finance professional, shares, “My husband and I have these long WFH hours, so this weekend we’ve decided to order something from out and binge on a show at night when we are free. Don’t see any harm as it’s just once a week, right? But many are also doing these on weekdays, something that was rare in pre-COVID times.” ‘We recently got an order at 3.30am for tacos’Rajesh Dhaktode of a cloud kitchen at Bandra affirms the late-order trend. He says, “There has been an increase in food deliveries in the late evening hours and late night since recently. What is surprising is that people don’t want anything fancy, but order the basic fare — rice and gravy combos being the most popular. Normally we used to receive orders from BKC, Kalina and Bandra West, but now we are seeing orders from Prabhadevi, Worli and Andheri, too.” Adds Megha Datwani from a restaurant at Khar, “Night food deliveries are big and in fact, most of our orders are flowing in after 11pm. Cricket is one thing, but the ongoing international football matches also start at midnight, so people want to eat through that. And it’s mostly quick bites that people want. Pizzas are in big demand, so are burritos and enchiladas. Platters with different starters are also being ordered late at night, even as far as 3am. In fact, we recently got a 3.30am order for tacos!” Many are ordering to enjoy a late-night snack while watching their favourite game or bingeing on a TV show (Pic: iStock; For representational purpose only)The weather is also pushing the demand for ice creams and cold desserts. Reveals a staffer at a juice centre at Haji Ali, “Seasonal items are big now, so there’s a huge demand for everything mango – juice, shakes and mango with cream.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/midnight-delivery-picks-up-pace-as-mumbaikars-turn-late-night-diners/articleshow/82132217.cms||Ismat Tahseen

"Whether it is Kumbh or Ramzan, there has been no Covid-appropriate behaviour. It cannot happen. That is why we had to appeal and the Kumbh has now turned symbolic," Shah said in an interview with Times Now channel.

The new variant of the virus spreads quicker. It is less lethal but spreads faster.” Coronavirus: Complete coverageShah further said scientists were studying new mutants and would soon have a fix on them. "The speed at which the virus is spreading today is certainly problematic but I have full faith that we will win the second fight against the pandemic," he added. He also highlighted that most of the worst-affected states were those which had large diaspora populations. "Punjab, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Kerala, Delhi... it is these states which have a larger international travel," he said.

Self-quarantining andOn the possibility of a lockdown, Shah said it was for states to decide. "For the last three months, we have allowed states to impose restrictions as per their analysis. Every state is fighting a different battle. Evaluation will have to be done by state governments, and they have the right to impose restrictions. It is up to states to decide what needs to be done to curb the spread. If the situation is normal in Assam even after the elections, what is the need to impose lockdown there?" he said.

Shah, who addressed two rallies during the day, claimed that Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee will haveWhen asked about political parties carrying on with their campaign amid surging infections, the minister said the issue fell within the jurisdiction of the Election Commission. “The EC spoke with all parties, and it was decided to reduce campaigning by one day and to finish the day’s campaign by 7 pm. Political parties were urged to provide masks and sanitisers at rallies and my party has, starting with the PM's rally on April 17, provided 5 crore masks. But what is to be done about an election which is underway can only be decided by the EC,” he said. Shah was bullish about BJP's prospects in the Bengal polls and said the party’s strong performance in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections had dispelled people’s doubts about its electoral viability and it was set to win more than 200 seats. “I have enough experience of participating in elections. I can guarantee you that BJP will form the government with more than 200 seats,” he said, adding that Trinamool was now scared. Shah denied that BJP had enlisted the “Jai Shri Ram” chant to seek to mobilise the majority community, insisting that it was not a religious slogan. "Jai Shri Ram imbibes the idea of development, it means standing up against injustice. It means opposing politics of polarisation and reflects the pain of those who have been living in the country without citizenship. It signifies the rage of devotees who have to go to courts to organise Durga Puja. Jai Shri Ram reflects the pain of those three teachers who were killed because they wanted to study and teach in Bangla and Urdu and whose last rites could not be performed," he said, asserting that the PM's speeches in Bengal were focused on development. On the Sitalkuchi incident, he repeated his allegation that West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee first engineered the incident by inciting people to gherao paramilitary personnel and then tried to exploit the deaths of those who were killed in the firing that ensued. Shah also said Banerjee had left out mention of Anand Burman who was shot dead from point blank range in the same village.

The coverage remains poor, considering vaccination began on January 16 with health workers, followed by frontline workers, with only 2.36 crore health and frontline workers registered for vaccination, even though states and UTs were asked to pre-populate this category. If the number of registered health and frontline workers is considered, the coverage of those fully vaccinated rises to 47%, which is still less than half. Officials said many states had not been able to mobilise this priority population, resulting in slow pace of vaccination during the initial phase. Though many well-known doctors and public figures came forward to endorse the vaccines after an intensive awareness drive about safety and efficacy of vaccines by the health ministry, there were still some who remained hesitant and did not come forward for their shots. Some might have assumed they had antibodies since they had not developed infections, an official said. “There is absolutely no justification for vaccine hesitancy among health workers. If a healthcare worker has vaccine hesitancy, it will be very difficult to recommend vaccination to society at large and there should be some consequences if this category does not get itself vaccinated,” Manipal Hospitals chairman Dr Sudarshan Ballal said. Overall, 12.26 crore doses were administered till 7 am on Sunday. Over 10.8 lakh people between 45 and 60 and 38.9 lakh above 60 have been fully vaccinated with two doses. Currently, eight states account for 59.5% of the total doses given so far. Maharashtra (1,21,39,453), Uttar Pradesh (1,07,12,739), Rajasthan (1,06,98,771) and Gujarat (1,03,37,448) have so far administered more than 1 crore doses each. However, in terms of share of their population, the coverage has been low in many of these states despite the surge in new cases. Maharashtra and UP have not done not well in coverage of the over-60 population.

A consistent rise was seen since April 12 even as tests increased only marginally. Chhattisgarh recorded a phenomenal 30.3% infection rate. The national weekly positivity rate has increased from 3% to 13.5% in the last one month. Besides Chhattisgarh, states and UTs like Goa, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Ladakh also reported high positivity during April 11-17, depicting a steep rise in weekly positivity as compared to a month ago (March 11-17). Goa (24.2%), Maharashtra (24.1%) and Rajasthan (23.3%) have weekly positivity above 20%, indicating the need for much more testing and containment.   Officials said while cases were increasing rapidly, daily tests to detect infections had not increased proportionately in most states. Moreover, the share of RT-PCR continues to be low in states of concern which have a high caseload. Overall, daily tests have been in the range of 11.73 lakh to 15.66 lakh in the last 12 days. On Saturday, 2,61,500 new cases were reported across the country with 10 states accounting for 79% of the total. While Maharashtra continues to record the highest daily new cases at 67,123, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi are also reporting a steep rise in cases over last fortnight. Between April 4 and 17, Uttar Pradesh saw daily new cases increase from 4,136 to 27,334, whereas in Delhi, fresh cases jumped from 4,033 to 24,375 in the same period. The other states with large number of new cases are Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan. In most of these states, healthcare systems are under pressure with many serious patients seeking oxygen support and ventilator supported ICU beds. The Centre has asked states to urgently increase hospital infrastructure and bed strength. In a letter to states and UTs, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan asked them to ensure maximum possible dedicated hospitals or blocks for Covid-19 patients. On Saturday, 1,501 new deaths were reported and Maharashtra saw the maximum of 419, followed by Delhi at 167. With more deaths from the infection, the national recovery rate has dropped during this second wave to 86.62%. India’s total active caseload has reached over 18 lakh cases with Maharashtra alone accounting for 38% of the total.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/daily-positivity-rate-doubles-from-8-to-16-7-in-just-12-days/articleshow/82135403.cms||Sushmi Dey

Singh offered five suggestions to ramp up vaccination programme, urging the government to be transparent in publicising data on stocks and their distribution patterns. He said the Centre should grant greater flexibility to states to decide who to designate and vaccinate as frontline workers even if they are below 45 years, and support vaccine manufacturers with funds and concessions. “The government should indicate how this expected supply will be distributed across states based on a transparent formula,” he said, adding that the Centre should retain 10% supplies for emergency use. Singh said there was a need to place advance orders for vaccine supplies so that manufacturers could adhere to schedules of supply and states should have a clear signal of likely availability so that they could plan their rollout. Extending his suggestions to the PM in the spirit of “constructive cooperation”, Singh also warned the government against the temptation of looking at absolute numbers of people being vaccinated, and to focus instead on the percentage of population vaccinated. The former PM said the Centre must proactively support vaccine producers to expand their manufacturing facilities quickly by providing them with funds and other concessions. “I believe this is the time to invoke the compulsory licensing provisions in the law, so that a number of companies are able to produce the vaccines under a licence. This, I recall, had happened earlier in the case of medicines to deal with the HIV/AIDS disease,” he said. Singh said as far as Covid-19 was concerned, he had read that Israel has already invoked the compulsory licensing provision and there was an overwhelming case for India to do so as well quickly. He said keeping in mind limited domestic supplies, vaccines cleared for use by credible authorities like the European Medical Agency or USFDA should be allowed to be imported without insisting on domestic bridging trials. “We are facing an unprecedented emergency and, I understand, experts are of the view that this relaxation is justified in an emergency. The relaxation could be for a limited period during which bridging trials could be completed in India,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/manmohan-singh-offers-pm-5-point-covid-fight-plan/articleshow/82135603.cms||---

Night curfew from 10pm to 4am and total curfew on Sundays will be effective from April 20 in Tamil Nadu. According to a statement issued by the state government, no public or private transport will be allowed during night curfew. Intra-state and inter-state public and private transport will also not be allowed to operate. “Not over 100 people will be allowed in weddings and for funerals, the number stands at 50. Only 50% employees will be allowed in IT firms. Others should work from home,” the statement said. Continuous process industries can continue to operate even on full curfew days. All tourist locations, including hill stations, beaches, zoos, parks and archeological sites will be barred for the public on all days from April 20. Tamil Nadu has also postponed class 12 state board examinations without fixing a fresh date. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday announced night curfew from 9pm to 5am, besides authorising all district and block headquarters to impose Section 144 of the CrPC to restrict crowd movement in places and areas they would deem as fit for putting prohibitory orders in place. He also announced the payment of one-month additional salary to the frontline doctors, health workers and others concerned. The government also decided to keep schools, colleges, other educational institutions and religious places closed till May 15. There will be no examination during the period, except those conducted by recruitment commissions, the CM said. All parks, cinema halls, swimming pools and malls have been closed while all kinds of private and official public functions have been prohibited. Shops, fruit and vegetable mandis will close by 6pm, instead of 7pm. Dining in restaurants and dhabas has been banned but home delivery of edible items is allowed till 9pm, Nitish said. He said the number of persons attending the burial and funeral ceremonies has been pruned to 25, while only 100 persons will now be allowed to participate in the marriage and ‘shraddh' ceremonies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/night-curfew-fresh-curbs-across-tamil-nadu-bihar/articleshow/82135641.cms||---
---||Business||As Covid second wave surges, wait for e-grocery delivery gets longer||NEW DELHI: As restrictions return across major cities, it’s déjà vu for consumers looking to place online orders of grocery and other essentials. E-commerce platforms such as Amazon India, Flipkart and e-grocers such as Bigbasket and Grofers are seeing a surge in demand. They are also opening a limited number of slots for deliveries. This has impacted delivery timelines -- from a day to four days, depending on the city and the pin code. There is no panic buying yet this year for staples like flour, rice and pulses besides disinfectants, hand sanitisers, and diapers. The development comes as governments are urging people across metros to stay at home, and states like Maharashtra allowing people to move only for essentials needs, shutting down malls and restaurants (for dine-in services). Delhi had its first weekend curfew this week. This is almost a replay of last year when the whole country was under a stringent lockdown. There was an 80-100% jump in online orders back then. The spike in orders currently is not as much as in March last year because the current restrictions are localised and do not apply to all major cities yet. But the trend remains steady with more demand for essentials online. While e-commerce firms are better prepared than last year, there is still an impact with longer delivery estimates, industry executives said. Even in Bengaluru, which hasn’t put stringent restrictions, e-commerce platforms are cautioning users that deliveries may take longer than estimated. “In Delhi, things are still fine but there is a significant surge in orders across Mumbai compared to last year. We are trying to open new slots but have to be practical about it since consumers will get upset if deliveries are delayed by more than a few hours,” an executive from an e-grocery platform said. Senior executives across online platforms are in a virtual huddle to overcome logistical problems in different cities. “We are working across the operations network to enable faster deliveries to customers,” a spokesperson for Amazon India said. “As an essential service provider, we have not faced any last-mile challenges and are working closely with local authorities to prevent any potential disruptions. Since there is a movement of migrant workforce due to the current situation, we are hiring additional warehouse and delivery staff to address the surge in demand and serve as many households as we can in this time of need. We are also opening up slots on the app every day for our customers, while prioritising the supply of essential products,” a Grofers spokesperson said. Bigbasket and Flipkart did not immediately respond to TOIs’s query on the matter. “Companies are more prepared this time around but the issue of allowing essentials only in cities like Mumbai will be hard. At this point, anything can be essential for a user. There is no panic buying for now and the next few weeks will be critical (as to how this plays out),” said Satish Meena, senior forecast analyst at Forrester, a market research firm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/as-second-wave-surges-wait-for-e-grocery-delivery-gets-longer/articleshow/82135879.cms||Digbijay Mishra
---||Business||Companies help men get back to work after break||MUMBAI: Career transition programmes for professionals who take a break are no longer restricted to women. What started as a platform offering second career opportunities to help women return to work are now increasingly being extended to men as well. Organisations like John Deere, UBS and Deutsche Bank have inclusive second career programmes for both men and women. If women largely take career breaks for child care, men too have left careers for various reasons including eldercare. Pune-based tractor manufacturer John Deere has a programme called REAP (Rekindle your career, Engage back with workplace, Apply your skills and talents, Perform and prove your mettle). This was initially conceptualised as a second career programme for women. The company’s regional talent management leader Shobha Pandey said, “When we presented this to the country group, during the discussion a point emerged — why not extend the programme to men as well? We want to be an inclusive organisation, and inclusion is about everyone. Men are equally taking breaks. The idea is to tap people who have taken breaks for various reasons.” With REAP becoming completely gender-neutral, the only guideline for applicants is a two-year career break. “However, we do look at what relevant experience the person has had in his/her career and whether the person requires any upskilling,” said Pandey. UBS India’s ‘Career Comeback Programme’ is designed to help men and women on a career break of 18 months or more to transition into a corporate role in full-time or part-time capacity. There are no earmarked roles and the company believes in hiring and absorbing these candidates in immediately available open positions. There’s no age limit either — just willingness and relevant prior experience in a wide variety of areas like technology, finance, operations, HR, analytics, AI and data sciences. Sometimes a career break can make it tougher for professionals to return to the corporate world. UBS India head (HR) Jyothi Menon said, “A professional may take a break for any reason — family care, sabbatical or to try something new. We believe each of these experiences offers valuable insight to the individual. Career Comeback Programme offers a platform to make the transition easier through coaching and learning interventions that help the candidate come up to speed and contribute and succeed in their next innings at work.” Once the candidate is onboarded, there’s a journey of 6-8 months, customised to the team and the role they join in with learning interventions, buddies, mentors and networking opportunities. “They’re also inducted into a peer network, which is a community of ‘career comebackers’ across UBS (in different countries and roles) who offer support and share experiences. We run sessions to equip hiring managers with tools to make the transition process smoother for the career comebacker in their team, along with a 90-day onboarding schedule that supports the managers and their newest members as part of the programme,” said Menon. Under its gender-neutral ‘Return to Work’ programme, Deutsche Bank India has hired candidates who had taken a career break, including a phased back-to-work by offering part-time roles as well. DB India HR head Madhavi Lall said, “The idea is to have a diverse talent participation from various walks of life, which in turn helps bring in wide-ranging ideas, thought process and perspective to work. We plan to make this programme more structured and institutionalised and build scale.” However, a majority of those who opt to come back under a second career programme are women. The reason for this could be that as compared to men, more women take career breaks. John Deere’s REAP has so far benefited one man, while at UBS, four male candidates have made a comeback. “We will continue to run the programme and will keep updating our interventions and processes to include more professionals who wish to come back to a corporate role,” said Menon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cos-help-men-get-back-to-work-after-break/articleshow/82134850.cms||Namrata Singh

At 61,647 cases, the state battled an all-time high number of active patients with almost all private and government hospitals nearly full. As Gujarat fights an unprecedented health crisis triggered by the pandemic, TOI spoke to CM Vijay Rupani who said that the biggest priority is adding oxygen beds in the state. “In the past one month, we have increased the number of Covid beds by 37,000 – from 41,000 on March 15 to 78,000 on April 18. Overall, the state now has 35,000 oxygen beds and 10,000 ICU beds,” said Rupani. With more and more patients getting hypoxic and needing oxygen to breathe, the state will add 8,000 beds with oxygen supply in the next 10 days. “We are adding oxygen beds on a war footing,” the CM said. It needs mention that Gujarat ranks among 10 states recording highest daily cases and five states registering highest daily deaths in India. Terming oxygen as the biggest focus area for the state government for Covid treatment, the CM said that during the last wave in November-December the daily oxygen requirement was 250MT. “In this wave, it has increased by three times to 830MT. It can be interpreted both ways – the number of patients requiring oxygen has increased, and the number of beds with oxygen supply has also increased,” he said. Rupani said that the notification is already issued that all the oxygen manufacturing in and around four major cities – Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot – would be diverted for medical usage only to meet the rise in demand. The CM said that eight municipal corporations are key to contain the viral spread. “The eight cities account for 65-70% of the daily cases. If we can control the new cases there, we can control the overall situation. Thus, the testing is ramped up to quickly find new cases, containment zones are increased and new beds are added,” said Rupani. He pointed at the upcoming 900-bed medical facility in Ahmedabad at Gujarat University Convention Centre in coordination of DRDO as one such example. “We are starting the trial run for it on April 22. The facility can be expanded for 500 more beds,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/will-add-8k-oxygen-beds-in-10-days-on-a-war-footing-cm/articleshow/82134511.cms||Parth Shastri

On April 3, thousands of people had gathered at Bavdhan village, in Wai taluka of Satara district, for the annual Bagaad yatra on the occasion of Rangapanchami. The gathering had taken place despite prohibitory orders and Covid restrictions being in place. More than 100 organisers were ultimately booked and around 84 people were arrested. Before the yatra was held, the village, with a population of 10,000, had reported only four Covid cases since the pandemic had receded last year. However, since the mass gathering, more than 117 cases have been added to the village’s Covid tally. Moreover, several cases have been reported in nearby villages from where the people had gone to attend the yatra. Similarly, after the political campaigning — without adherence to the Covid protocol — the number of infections have gone up in the Pandharpur-Mangalwedha assembly segment. Mangalwedha has reported 494 cases and 10 Covid deaths in the past 10 days, while Pandharpur has recorded 1,565 new cases and five deaths. The local administration had even registered cases against organisers of the political meetings, especially those of the NCP and BJP. However, that did not deter both the parties from holding large public meetings in the open. The district health authorities said that anticipating a spike in cases, mass surveillance has already been started. Solapur district health officer Shitalkumar Jadhav said: “Mass surveillance and testing in both the talukas have been ramped up. The spike in cases clearly shows that a large number of people had come in contact with each other mainly during the political meetings. We expect the number to go up over the next two weeks as the current strain is more virulent when compared to the virus strain observed last year and it infects a large number of contacts.” Mangalwedha taluka, which is mostly rural, was reporting less than 30 cases every day 10 days ago. Now the daily count has crossed the 120-mark. Similarly, Pandharpur taluka, which has the temple town of Pandharpur, used to report around 100 cases daily. This number has doubled to 200. Pandharpur has added the highest number of cases in the past 10 days among the 10 talukas in Solapur district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/covid-cases-rise-after-secret-bagaad-yatra-in-satara-and-poll-rallies-in-solapur/articleshow/82132241.cms||---

While Welspun offered Rs 425 crore for the Hyderabad-based company, lenders led by Canara Bank have proposed to go ahead with J C Flowers’ offer. In a letter to Sathavahana’s lenders, which has also been marked to the finance ministry and has been accessed by TOI, Welspun said that absence of a proper process and resulting information asymmetry has hindered value maximisation for the lenders. Sathavahana, with a debt of Rs 1,250 crore, was declared an NPA in June 2017. Mismanagement of the company by promoters led to inability in servicing loans and the consequent NPA status, according to Welspun’s letter. Welspun had submitted an indicative offer of Rs 360 crore for Sathavahana’s loan portfolio. When it was informed that JC Flowers’ Rs 410-crore offer had been selected as the H1 bid, Welspun improved its offer to Rs 425 crore. However, it was told that lenders had proposed to go ahead with JC Flowers. “Lenders should take cognizance of our Rs 425-crore offer as H1 bid for the proposed Swiss challenge, or they should run a transparent e-auction process, which will result in better value realisation for them according to RBI directives on this matter,” the letter said. Sathavahana’s pig iron is used as raw material to manufacture steel pipes, which are part of Welspun’s business interests. “Acceptance of a lower bid of Rs 410 crore will result in lenders foregoing additional benefits to the tune of Rs 15 crore offered in Welspun bid,” the Mumbai-based enterprise said and requested it to be considered as the H1 bidder for Swiss challenge. Welspun declined to comment on the report, while Canara Bank couldn’t be reached for a comment. Under the Swiss Challenge method, an H1 bidder’s quote is taken as an initial price and the other buyer can make a counter offer. The H1 is then offered an opportunity to match the counter offer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/welspun-asks-iron-co-sathavahanas-lenders-to-consider-revised-rs-425cr-bid/articleshow/82134804.cms||Reeba Zachariah

The restructuring is, however, subject to the K V Kamath-led expert committee’s nod. The resolution plan also includes the restructuring of Future Retail’s non-convertible debentures (NCDs) that are listed on bourses. However, NCDs issued to certain trusts and US bonds, carrying an annual interest of 5.6% and maturing in 2025, will not be part of the resolution plan, Future Retail said. The company believes that it will be able to recover from the Covid-induced financial stress once the resolution plan is implemented. Future Retail has a debt of about Rs 10,000 crore and the restructuring will give promoter Kishore Biyani time to chalk out a new strategy even as he awaits the court’s approval on the sale of the company’s business to Reliance. As part of the resolution plan, lenders have agreed to extend the repayment period of working capital loans by two years. They have also decided to waive unpaid penal interest and processing fees from March 2020 till the implementation date of the plan. They have also agreed to convert interest accrued between March and September 2020 into a loan, which will have to be paid by December.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/future-retail-lenders-give-nod-to-debt-recast-plan/articleshow/82134762.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The company currently has around Rs 235 crore of debt on its books with no major investments planned for the next two years. The promoter family of Pricol has also worked out a settlement and stake restructuring among family members moving all group businesses under a holding company said Pricol MD Vikram Mohan. “We have arrived at a settlement within the family including reorganisation of share holdings of all companies in the group,” said Vikram Mohan. “My brother has never been involved in the business and I have bought out his shares. We have moved all group businesses to a holding company structure and my wife and I will be involved in the business by the way of both ownership and management,” he added. Apart from Pricol, other group businesses were founded by Vikram Mohan but family members had some shares “which has now been sorted out,” he said. Apart from the flagship component company, the Pricol group also has hospitality, corporate & leisure travel, cargo and realty businesses. The company had recently seen some transfer of shares between promoter family members as part of “balancing personal books,” he said. “I had organised funds for family members to subscribe to the rights issue and those shares have now been gifted to me,” he explained. The family settlement comes at a time when Pricol is also cleaning up its books. Apart from a small Indonesian unit which is profitable and the Singapore-based purchasing unit, Pricol has exited all loss-making foreign subsidiaries. With around Rs 300 crore capex already spent in the last 2 years and new products and two new plants up and running, there will be no big capex spend coming up. Pricol is also entering new segments including a refocus on passenger vehicles now that the non-compete clause with Johnson Controls and Denso are over. “We are at 75% capacity utilisation and have increased marketshare and added new products which is why our revenue was up 40% in QFY21,” said Mohan. However is that Pricol can now produce only 85% of its demand due to a pronounced global integrated circuit shortage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pricol-to-turn-net-debt-free-by-2023-md/articleshow/82133410.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

The police got a tip-off that some people were gambling in a bungalow in the Gold Valley society area in Lonavla. A Lonavla city police team led by inspector Dilip Pawar raided the spot on Saturday night and found nine men gambling inside the bungalow. An officer said that none of them were following any social distancing norms. “All the nine men were traders from different parts of Mumbai,” an officer from the Lonavla City police said. The nine suspects have been booked under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Maharashtra Prevention of Gambling Act and the Epidemic Diseases Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nine-men-booked-for-gambling-in-lonavla/articleshow/82134384.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Now on, Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation won’t pick up unsegregated garbage||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) has decided to not collect non-segregated garbage from the public and instead opt for 100% door-to-door segregated waste collection. The civic body took the decision to intensify its solid waste management practices by adopting the guidelines of the Solid Waste Management rules 2016. The GVMC had earlier made a council resolution on SWM rules 2016. As per rules, waste generators will have the responsibility of segregating waste into three streams, including wet waste (biodegradable), dry waste (plastic, paper, metal, wood, etc.) and domestic hazardous wastes (diapers, napkins, empty containers of cleaning agents, mosquito repellents, etc.). GVMC commissioner G Srijana said that effective segregation would come with the benefit of only non-usable and non-recyclable waste reaching the landfill. “It would also offer several environmental benefits. The GVMC is promoting home gardening from composting of wet waste. The hazardous waste will be processed in a scientific manner,” said Srijana. The GVMC commissioner added that the civic body would identify those who cannot afford the bins for garbage segregation and distribute the bins free of cost. “The GVMC requests Vizagites to participate in this initiative and show their responsibility, as segregation of waste is the only mantra to reduce garbage in the city. With these measures, we can utilise our natural resources in an efficient way and also make for a better environment,” said Srijana. As per the Solid Waste Management rules 2016, waste generators shall hand over the segregated waste to authorised rag-pickers or waste collectors of the local bodies. Every street vendor should keep suitable containers for storage of waste generated during the course of the activity such as food waste, disposable plates, cups, cans, wrappers, coconut shells, leftover food, vegetables, fruits, etc. The GVMC is currently implementing a two-bin system in all commercial areas, by placing bins at a distance of every 50 metres. It has already banned plastic products of less than 50 microns through a council resolution, which empowers the civic body to levy fines on violators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/now-on-gvmc-wont-pick-up-unsegregated-garbage/articleshow/82132916.cms||---
---||Vadodara||In Gujarat, Covid tightening grip on children below 10 years||AHMEDABAD: It’s been more than a year of trial now for the children who were first locked up inside homes during the lockdown and having to cope with online education in the first round of the Covid-19 induced pandemic, but situation turned a shade worse for them now. Of the 20,162 Covid-19 cases registered in Surat city, 296 are of children between the age group of 0 and 10 years. This shows that the new strain in the second wave has made the young children, particularly infants, highly vulnerable to the deadly contagion. What’s more, the rate of fatality is also much higher among them as well as the need for oxygen or ventilator support. In Surat alone, on average nine kids have been infected on a daily basis in the past one month. In Vadodara, around six kids test positive daily in the rapid test carried out at the outpatient department of the state-run SSG Hospital. The situation has been so alarming that private children’s hospitals in the city had to even create ICU beds for infants. “Initially we created three beds for infants, but within a week we had to expand the facilities as more infants with severity were brought in,” said Dr Mohit Sahni, state president of National Neonatology Forum. Vadodara has witnessed 661 Covid-19 cases in the age group of zero to 10 years, of which 580 have recovered. Yet, there are 81 active cases in this age group, as per Vadodara Municipal Corporation’s data. “We had 16 patients who were treated at our Covid facility for paediatric patients. Ten of them have recovered while six are undergoing treatment,” said Dr Sheila Aiyer, head of Department of Paediatrics at SSG Hospital, which was the first in the state to set up a dedicated emergency room for kids in March. She confirmed that around six children test positive daily at OPD of the department. “Children are coming with bad pneumonia. As infection amongst adults is on the rise, we are getting more patients with each passing day,” said Aiyer. Dr Rakesh Joshi, additional medical superintendent in Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad, said that the positivity among the toddlers has increased manifold during the current wave. “It could well be attributed to the nature of the viral spread. This time we see many children whose parents or family members are infected first getting transmitted with the virus. Same with the newly-born whose mothers have got infected,” he said. “In 40% of the cases, the toddlers are getting infected either from playing outside or being exposed to infection inddors. However, mortality has remained low compared to the general population,” Dr Joshi added. At Ahmedabad civil hospital, about 12 paediatric patients are under treatment. The number in the first three months of 2021 had been hovering around one or two only. Doctors have been observing that infants are showing more severity than older children. “Some serious cases of older cases have also been reported, but these are less than infants,” said Sahni. “We are surprised at the parameters of the infants,” he added. Doctors are also planning to get in touch with the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune to know more about the strain of the virus. Last week, three infants had died during treatment for Covid-19 at different hospitals. Sahni said that the cause of death is renal failure or heart failure. “A few kids have been discharged and we may discharge three more in a couple of days,” Sahni said. Secretary of Ahmedabad Academy of Paediatrics, Dr Manish Mehta said that diarrhoea has remained a very common symptom in recent times along with gastro-intestinal involvement. Dr Pushkar Shrivastava, an Ahmedabad-based paediatrician said that the number of adolescents is slightly higher owing to their movement as well as insensitivity to safety rules. “Along with the symptomatic patients, we should also keep in mind that several kids also have post-Covid complications, commonly known as multi-system inflammatory syndrome which can happen for up to two months of recovery,” Dr Shrivastava said, adding that the common symptoms include reddening of eyes, lips or tongue along with lack of energy.

---||Surat||In Gujarat, Covid tightening grip on children below 10 years||AHMEDABAD: It’s been more than a year of trial now for the children who were first locked up inside homes during the lockdown and having to cope with online education in the first round of the Covid-19 induced pandemic, but situation turned a shade worse for them now. Of the 20,162 Covid-19 cases registered in Surat city, 296 are of children between the age group of 0 and 10 years. This shows that the new strain in the second wave has made the young children, particularly infants, highly vulnerable to the deadly contagion. What’s more, the rate of fatality is also much higher among them as well as the need for oxygen or ventilator support. In Surat alone, on average nine kids have been infected on a daily basis in the past one month. In Vadodara, around six kids test positive daily in the rapid test carried out at the outpatient department of the state-run SSG Hospital. The situation has been so alarming that private children’s hospitals in the city had to even create ICU beds for infants. “Initially we created three beds for infants, but within a week we had to expand the facilities as more infants with severity were brought in,” said Dr Mohit Sahni, state president of National Neonatology Forum. Vadodara has witnessed 661 Covid-19 cases in the age group of zero to 10 years, of which 580 have recovered. Yet, there are 81 active cases in this age group, as per Vadodara Municipal Corporation’s data. “We had 16 patients who were treated at our Covid facility for paediatric patients. Ten of them have recovered while six are undergoing treatment,” said Dr Sheila Aiyer, head of Department of Paediatrics at SSG Hospital, which was the first in the state to set up a dedicated emergency room for kids in March. She confirmed that around six children test positive daily at OPD of the department. “Children are coming with bad pneumonia. As infection amongst adults is on the rise, we are getting more patients with each passing day,” said Aiyer. Dr Rakesh Joshi, additional medical superintendent in Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad, said that the positivity among the toddlers has increased manifold during the current wave. “It could well be attributed to the nature of the viral spread. This time we see many children whose parents or family members are infected first getting transmitted with the virus. Same with the newly-born whose mothers have got infected,” he said. “In 40% of the cases, the toddlers are getting infected either from playing outside or being exposed to infection inddors. However, mortality has remained low compared to the general population,” Dr Joshi added. At Ahmedabad civil hospital, about 12 paediatric patients are under treatment. The number in the first three months of 2021 had been hovering around one or two only. Doctors have been observing that infants are showing more severity than older children. “Some serious cases of older cases have also been reported, but these are less than infants,” said Sahni. “We are surprised at the parameters of the infants,” he added. Doctors are also planning to get in touch with the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune to know more about the strain of the virus.

The PM sought the latest figures of testing, beds, medicines, vaccines, manpower and treatment of Covid patients in the district. He thanked doctors and medical staff for doing their duty in this hour of crisis and urged them to use their experience of the first wave last year and move forward cautiously. Modi asked officials to focus on the strategy of ‘testing, tracking and treating’ adopted during the first wave of pandemic. Interacting with public representatives and officials, the PM said he is also taking feedback from the people of Varanasi constantly. “The expansion and modernisation of medical infrastructure in Varanasi in the last five-six years has helped in combating Covid. Since the number of patients is increasing, the number of beds in Covid facilities, ventilators and availability of oxygen is being augmented in Varanasi,” the PM added. The entire machinery has to work with the same strategy which had helped in controlling the first wave of Covid-19, Modi said. The Prime Minister emphasized on increasing efforts at all levels due to increase in cases. He said that the Varanasi administration should step up the pace of work in all fields in the same way it rapidly set up the ‘Kashi Covid Response Centre’. He asked officials to ensure early results of Covid samples so that treatment can be started promptly if the report is positive so that severity and complications can be prevented. The PM also told officials to take proper care of patients in home isolation sensitively with full responsibility. He also appealed to the people to wear masks, maintain two-yard distance and strictly follow all Covid protocols. He also asked officials to ensure that maximum people over 45 years are vaccinated in the ongoing drive. The PM appreciated the role of social and voluntary organisations in extending all support to the government in combating Covid-19 effectively and urged all public representatives and officials to ask people to be alert and cautious to avoid further spread of the pandemic. Earlier, the officials gave all details of arrangements, exercises and measures for tackling Covid-19, including setting up a control room for contract tracing, home isolation, command and control centre, dedicated phone lines, ambulance services, telemedicine facilities and rapid response teams. They informed the PM that 1,98,383 people had been given the first dose and 35,014 have received the second dose of the vaccine against Covid-19 in the district so far. Divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal, police commissioner A Satish Ganesh, district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma, municipal commissioner Gaurang Rathi, chief medical officer Dr NP Singh and IMS-BHU director Prof B R Mittal attended the virtual meeting with the PM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/ramp-up-efforts-to-counter-surgeensure-prompt-aid-to-people-pm/articleshow/82133274.cms||---

One police officer and a constable posted at Gandhi Maidan police station in the state capital were the latest to be tested positive for the virus. Similar cases were reported from Kankarbagh, Buddha Colony, Patrakarnagar, Shastri Nagar, Beur, Phulwarisharif, Gopalpur and Naubatpur police stations in Patna district. The spike in corona cases prompted IG, central range, Sanjay Singh to instruct the station house officers (SHOs) to restrict the entry of visitors to the police stations. As per the IG’s instruction, complaint boxes were installed at the entrance gate of many police stations. The complainants were asked to talk to the officials on phone. The situation in other districts was no better. Authoritative sources said altogether 16 police personnel, including seven officers and nine constables, tested positive in Bhagalpur district. Bhagalpur SSP Natasha Guria said among the cops found infected were the SHOs of Nathnagar, Kotwali and Mozahidpur police stations in the district. As a result, sub-inspectors have been given additional charge of the respective police stations. Similarly, four constables and a home guard deputed at the official residence of Supaul DM tested positive for the virus. One woman constable was also infected in Naugachhia police district. However, Katihar was the worst hit as 83 cops were detected positive in the district. Katihar SP Vikas Kumar said among the infected were three inspectors and two sub-inspectors. The rest were constables posted at different police stations. Kumar admitted that the investigation was getting hampered due to police officers testing positive for Covid. Policemen being infected with the virus were also reported from Gaya, Banka, Nawada and Munger districts. Many police officers posted with the CID at the police headquarters were also found infected. The state police headquarters has already restricted the entry of outsiders as a precautionary measure. “The situation has turned worse in the last few days,” a senior IPS officer said. A police officer, preferring anonymity, said sub-inspector Rakesh Kumar, who was attached to the SIT constituted to probe the Munger police firing, died of Covid-19. Meanwhile, the police headquarters has directed all the SPs to get all police barracks, police lines, offices of the senior police officers and the police stations sanitised to avoid trouble.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/inquiry-into-many-cases-hit-as-cops-test-ve-across-state/articleshow/82133121.cms||Ramashankar

The deceased was identified as Dumpa Pawan Reddy (19), a native of Regalagadda village of Konkanamitla mandal. According to Pellur police, the incident happened on Saturday morning when he was found by fellow students hanging from the ceiling fan in the hostel kitchen. The students soon informed the warden and other college staff members and teachers. Cops said that they are yet to ascertain the actual reason behind the extreme step but suspect that the deceased might have taken the decision due to poor academic performance. Preliminary inquiry revealed that he had been expressing guilt for his poor performance as he had failed his previous exams as well. Family members, however, alleged that Pawan Reddy was beaten up by his teachers after he was caught cheating in his exams using answer slips on Friday. Cops registered a case under Section 174 of CrPC and the body was sent to Ongole Government Hospital for postmortem. Further investigation is still on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/inter-student-hangs-self-in-hostel-kitchen/articleshow/82133006.cms||---

---||Patna||60 tonnes of liquid oxygen brought to city in 3 days||PATNA: At least 60 tonnes of liquid oxygen has been supplied to Patna within three days in an attempt to address the acute shortage of medical oxygen in hospitals with exponential rise in Covid-19 cases in the state. As per the sources, one tanker with liquid oxygen reached Patna on Friday morning, followed by two more on Saturday and one on Sunday morning. The liquid oxygen came from two industrial gas plants at Bokaro in Jharkhand. As per the sources, two-three more tankers with liquid oxygen are expected to reach by Monday morning. Liquid oxygen is being supplied to three different oxygen gas manufacturing plants in Patna where cylinders are refilled for supply to the hospitals. The state industries department is coordinating with the Patna district administration to meet the needs of liquid oxygen supply. However, Dr Ashok Sinha of a private hospital at Saguna Mor in Patna said there was still a shortage of oxygen at medical institutions. “Supply is yet to get streamlined. We are still not getting oxygen in normal quantities, forcing us to deny admissions,” he said. Sinha said that his hospital used to get 170 oxygen cylinders per day on normal days, but they are somehow managing to procure 70 to 80 cylinders only. As per the official data shared by Patna district administration, 3900 oxygen cylinders were supplied from the three gas plants in Patna on Friday and 3973 on Saturday. The oxygen gas manufacturing plants have been instructed to run round the clock in three shifts. As per district administration’s assessment, at least 10,000 oxygen cylinders are required by hospitals in Patna in the present scenario per day. Besides, Patna requires four tankers of liquid oxygen per day for meeting the requirements. Besides bringing large consignment of liquid oxygen from manufacturing plants outside the state, oxygen supply to industries by the three Patna plants has been limited to 10%, which was earlier as high as 80%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/60-tonnes-of-liquid-oxygen-brought-to-city-in-3-days/articleshow/82132906.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Citylights||Rare Trees Vanish From City As Bldgs Mushroom Thanks to the unplanned growth of this historic city, rare and beautiful species of plants have vanished during the last five to six decades. Even ‘patli’ trees after which the city had derived its ancient name ‘Patliputra’ are on the verge of extinction. Only a few species of this tree, including one on Patna Museum campus, can be found in the city today. Old timers recall that a huge tree near A N Sinha Institute of Social Studies and two trees near Biscomaun Bhawan of Adansonia Digitata species (monkey-bread tree) existed long ago, but they were cut down when the construction of these buildings started. These trees had swollen trunk containing water inside and travellers used to quench their thirst by boring the trunk. These trees are very much missed by the Patnaites, especially during summer. Guazama Tomentosa trees have great medicinal value. A few trees of this species, closely resembling the Kamini tree, existed near the place where a posh hotel is now located near Gandhi Maidan. At least four other plant species, namely Hyphaene Indica, Madhuca Longifalia, Didymocarpus Ladelicate and Tectona Grandis, which used to be the prized possession of the city until a few decades back, have already vanished, according to botanists. In Ambedkar’s Memory Volunteers of Youth for Free India, an active social work movement of the St Xavier’s College of Management and Technology students, visited slums in Digha, Rajeev Nagar and Ashiana Nagar on the 130th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar on April 14 and told the residents about the life and contributions of the architect of Indian Constitution. They also recited inspirational quotes and distributed sweets, chocolates and stationery among the children of the slums. The social awareness committee of the college also organised a poster-making competition on Ambedkar and his contributions. In the debate contest, eight students tried to influence the feelings of the virtual audience with their arguments for and against the motion. Unique Initiative Railways has roped in scouts and guides to create awareness among people and convince them to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. Artists-cum-railway employees, on the other hand, are being seen holding street plays at different places, including Patna Junction, on the theme of Covid-19 to aware people and contain spread of the virus in the city. Danapur DRM Sunil Kumar said banners, posters and play cards are other mediums through which people are being told to wear masks and maintain social distancing to keep Covid at bay.

But people are confused as they fear getting infected,” said Anita, who works in south Delhi. “Last year, due to the lockdown and the surge, I stayed at home without work for four months. I literally spent days without money.” Anita is not alone. The situation of most domestic workers or those working mostly on daily wages is almost the same.Nazeer and his wife Manbara Begum segregate plastic waste at the Bhalswa site. Manbara also works as a house help. “We have a hand-to-mouth existence. That’s why two days’ restrictions have brought back the memories of last year’s financial crunch,” said Nazeer. “We also fear catching infection but don’t have the option of sitting at or working from home.” Many people, especially working couples, are confused about domestic workers, as they still have to go to work. “In our colony, though 80% people didn’t call their house workers, nobody plans to discontinue them unless there is a lockdown,” said Ruby Makhija of Navjiwan Vihar.Anjali Bhardwaj, an RTI activist and founding member of Satark Nagrik Sangathan, said it was the responsibility of the government to look after these people. After the mass exodus last year, Delhi government had decided to distribute ration to 10 lakh non-card holders, but many more were there. “We pursued the matter in the HC and finally 55 lakh such people got help.”The government should take steps before these people become unemployed and start returning to their hometowns, she said, adding that she had written to the chief minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/domestic-workers-take-early-trek-to-reach-workplace/articleshow/82134387.cms||Vibha Sharma

Majority of male members of my family, including my children, are in Kuwait,” he said. “I returned to India from Kuwait three months ago after leaving the responsibility of the business on the shoulders of my children as I always dreamt of doing something for my village. I want good educational institutions for girls, good roads, round-the-clock electricity and proper water supply. I am here also because I feel a lot of changes are required in the system.”  “People of Kuwait are very hardworking. I saw that Kuwaiti people work hard to see their country grow and prosper.

NMCH superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh, who had requested the health department on Saturday to relieve him from duty owing to shortage of oxygen and other facilities, said on Sunday that preparations were underway to create 500-bed facility exclusively for Covid-19 patients after receiving the letter Saturday evening. Dr Singh said 400 beds will have oxygen facilities while there will be 100 general beds, 43 ICU beds, including 38 for adults and five for kids, and 76 ventilators. The hospital presently have the capacity to admit 160 Covid-19 patients. However, around 175 patients were already admitted in the Covid ward and 14 ICU beds were also full. “The hospital can further increase 100 beds with oxygen facilities, if required. Meanwhile the patients requiring non-Covid tertiary care, who cannot be discharged, will be transferred to other hospitals on Monday,” he said. There are about 50 non-Covid patients admitted there. The superintendent has already written to the heads of both the hospitals to make arrangements for the patients. Dr Singh also pointed out that the hospital did not have the adequate staff to run the facility as a dedicated hospital. “I have written to the health department to provide 506 staff, including 100 physicians, for smooth functioning of the hospital. We need more doctors, nurses, ANMs, paramedics, lab technicians, anaesthesia operators and dialyses technicians among others. NMCH has only 1,500 staff, including medical staff, sweepers and ward boys,” he said. Talking about the oxygen crisis, the superintendent said its generation plant has the capacity to fill 45-50 cylinders per day, but the requirement has increased in last few weeks to 450 cylinders per day. “We have a small oxygen generation plant. The state government needs to increase its capacity as oxygen is also being supplied to other hospitals treating Covid patients,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nmch-readies-500-beds-for-coronavirus-patients/articleshow/82133069.cms||Faryal Rumi

After tie-up with another payment gateway earlier, the insurance giant has sought a fresh contract as most of its payments shift to digital modes. The new contract requires a smoother payment process, wider variety of payment options and adding more players (banks, wallets, etc) in payment channels. According to sources, there were 17 payments platforms that had bid aggressively. Paytm’s ability to straddle multiple payment services worked in its favour as others were dominant in particular segments like UPI or cards. LIC has seen a surge in digital payments after the pandemic. The corporation does Rs 60,000 crore of premium collections from the digital mode, which does not include the payment made through banks. It sees around 8 crore digital transactions — a number expected to go up sharply. LIC had sought an end-to-end solution not just for premium payments but for all type of collections including remittance of collections by insurance agents. The mandate also involves automation of some processes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/lic-appoints-paytm-to-handle-its-e-payments/articleshow/82134835.cms||Mayur Shetty

---||Patna||Hospitals struggle to handle patients as 300 doctors test Covid positive in Patna||PATNA: Over 300 doctors and hundreds of nurses and paramedics of different government and private hospitals in the city have gone into home isolation after being tested positive for Covid-19 in the last few days. Acting president of the state unit of Indian Medical Association (IMA) Dr Ajay Kumar said the number of such doctors was increasing with each passing day, thus affecting the healthcare system in urban and rural areas. However, since most doctors, nurses and healthcare workers have taken both doses of Covid vaccine, they have developed mild symptoms in the second wave and isolated themselves at home to protect others from catching the virus. As 62 doctors and 50 nurses of Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) have tested positive for Covid, the hospital administration has written to heads of all departments seeking details of the severity and symptoms of all those under home isolation. “Since most of them have taken both doses of vaccine, we want to assess the symptoms, severity and other Covid effects on them,” PMCH superintendent Dr I S Thakur said on Sunday. He admitted that non-availability of several infected doctors, nurses and healthcare workers has affected functioning at the OPDs. “Many of these doctors were involved in conducting Covid tests and microbiological examinations of samples. Some of them were also deputed in Covid wards,” he added. Dr Thakur said a separate 27-bed ward has been created for treatment of doctors and health workers of PMCH with serious Covid symptoms. At Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) too, healthcare services were affected with 25 doctors and 27 nurses testing positive for Covid and placing themselves under home isolation. “As most of them had received two vaccine doses, they have thankfully not experienced severity of the disease,” NMCH superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh said. However, the NMCH’s main concern for the time being is to shift about 150 non-Covid patients to other hospitals. The NMCH was recently made a Covid-dedicated hospital by the state government. “The hospital needs 800 to 900 oxygen cylinders per day for serious Covid patients. We have already informed the government about our requirement,” Dr Singh said. The number of Covid positive health workers at AIIMS-Patna has increased to 102. Hospital’s nodal officer for Covid Dr Sajeev Kumar said 25 junior residents, 17 senior doctors and 65 nurses are in home isolation. It is learnt that over 12 doctors of the ESIC Hospital at Bihta have also tested for positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hospitals-struggle-to-handle-patients-as-300-docs-test-covid-positive-in-city/articleshow/82132875.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Patna||Patna: Plasma demand up amid rise in Covid cases||PATNA: The city hospitals are again witnessing increase in demand for convalescent plasma used in the treatment of critical Covid-19 patients, as the number of cases and hospitalizations continue to rise in Bihar amid the second wave of pandemic. Convalescent plasma therapy is an experimental treatment where antibodies from the blood of people who have recovered from Covid-19 are given to those battling the virus to help them recover from the illness. It is believed that plasma helps produce an immune response to Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes the disease. AIIMS-Patna nodal officer for Covid Dr Sanjeev Kumar said the demand for plasma would increase manifold in the next few days as more critical patients are being admitted at the hospital. “The plasma therapy builds antibody in ill patients and helps them fight against the disease. This therapy, however, helps the patients with moderate symptoms in recovery, but less than 20% of severe cases survive,” he said. “The hospital has administered plasma to around 55 patients since March 22 and 80% received it in a couple of weeks. We are giving plasma only to those patients whose antibody titer (level) is above 6,” he said. NMCH is also witnessing demand of plasma therapy. The hospital sent such patients to AIIMS-P. NMCH nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Mukul Kumar Singh said they did not have the plasma storage and transfusion facility and had to refer such patients to AIIMS-P. “The demand for plasma therapy has been increasing as the dose of plasma along with the medication helps Covid patients build immunity. But in this phase, most of the Covid-19 patients admitted at the hospital are critically ill,” he added. The demand was the same at IGIMS and PMCH too. Several people took to social media urging people who recovered from the infection to come forward and donate plasma.Ravi Kumar, whose father is admitted at a private hospital in Kankarbagh, said he was trying to get O negative blood from donor who has recovered from Covid in the last 3 months. “I have requested on social media for donor. The hospital says plasma therapy would help him recover from the disease. He is in the ICU,” he said. Ayush Raj, who is trying to get blood plasma for his mother, said unlike last year, the number of donors has decreased.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/plasma-demand-up-amid-rise-in-cases/articleshow/82132884.cms||Faryal Rumi

Of the 20,162 Covid-19 cases registered in Surat city, 296 are of children between the age group of 0 and 10 years. This shows that the new strain in the second wave has made the young children, particularly infants, highly vulnerable to the deadly contagion. What’s more, the rate of fatality is also much higher among them as well as the need for oxygen or ventilator support. In Surat alone, on average nine kids have been infected on a daily basis in the past one month. In Vadodara, around six kids test positive daily in the rapid test carried out at the outpatient department of the state-run SSG Hospital. The situation has been so alarming that private children’s hospitals in the city had to even create ICU beds for infants. “Initially we created three beds for infants, but within a week we had to expand the facilities as more infants with severity were brought in,” said Dr Mohit Sahni, state president of National Neonatology Forum. Vadodara has witnessed 661 Covid-19 cases in the age group of zero to 10 years, of which 580 have recovered. Yet, there are 81 active cases in this age group, as per Vadodara Municipal Corporation’s data. “We had 16 patients who were treated at our Covid facility for paediatric patients. Ten of them have recovered while six are undergoing treatment,” said Dr Sheila Aiyer, head of Department of Paediatrics at SSG Hospital, which was the first in the state to set up a dedicated emergency room for kids in March. She confirmed that around six children test positive daily at OPD of the department. “Children are coming with bad pneumonia. As infection amongst adults is on the rise, we are getting more patients with each passing day,” said Aiyer. Dr Rakesh Joshi, additional medical superintendent in Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad, said that the positivity among the toddlers has increased manifold during the current wave. “It could well be attributed to the nature of the viral spread. This time we see many children whose parents or family members are infected first getting transmitted with the virus. Same with the newly-born whose mothers have got infected,” he said. “In 40% of the cases, the toddlers are getting infected either from playing outside or being exposed to infection inddors. However, mortality has remained low compared to the general population,” Dr Joshi added. At Ahmedabad civil hospital, about 12 paediatric patients are under treatment. The number in the first three months of 2021 had been hovering around one or two only. Doctors have been observing that infants are showing more severity than older children. “Some serious cases of older cases have also been reported, but these are less than infants,” said Sahni. “We are surprised at the parameters of the infants,” he added. Doctors are also planning to get in touch with the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune to know more about the strain of the virus. Last week, three infants had died during treatment for Covid-19 at different hospitals. Sahni said that the cause of death is renal failure or heart failure. “A few kids have been discharged and we may discharge three more in a couple of days,” Sahni said. Secretary of Ahmedabad Academy of Paediatrics, Dr Manish Mehta said that diarrhoea has remained a very common symptom in recent times along with gastro-intestinal involvement. Dr Pushkar Shrivastava, an Ahmedabad-based paediatrician said that the number of adolescents is slightly higher owing to their movement as well as insensitivity to safety rules. “Along with the symptomatic patients, we should also keep in mind that several kids also have post-Covid complications, commonly known as multi-system inflammatory syndrome which can happen for up to two months of recovery,” Dr Shrivastava said, adding that the common symptoms include reddening of eyes, lips or tongue along with lack of energy.

The government order (GO) issued by the chief secretary shows that 476 cases against 1,686 persons are pending between 1991 till 2021 and are yet to reach their logical conclusion. “A large number of such cases are found to be pending and the time taken for disposal of these disciplinary cases is unduly long in almost all cases. Such unacceptable delay in finalisation of the disciplinary cases results in a large number of employees remaining under suspension and drawing full/part salaries without turning out any work, thus proving to be a burden on the public exchequer,” the GO states. The GO prescribes specific deadlines for investigation and prosecution procedures for trap cases and disciplinary proceedings. It also reiterates that disciplinary proceedings against government employees should be carried out simultaneously with the criminal proceedings. “Failure to conclude the disciplinary proceedings within 100 days or failure to follow the above prescribed timelines by the departments, competent authorities and Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) shall be viewed seriously by the government and disciplinary action shall be taken against the concerned responsible for the delay,” the GO warns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/go-prescribes-100-days-to-clear-pending-acb-cases/articleshow/82133050.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Traders talk in 2 voices over markets’ closure||NEW DELHI: Several traders’ associations have decided to keep markets closed for a couple of days due to the surge in Covid-19 cases in the city. However, many other traders called these announcements as ‘rumours’ and confirmed that their businesses will re-open on Monday after the weekend curfew ends. Sanjay Bhargava, president of Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, said the association had an emergency zoom meeting with its members and requested that the Old Delhi establishments stay closed till April 25. “The market is quite congested and in spite of measures, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to maintain social distancing,” he said, adding that he doesn’t want the Covid situation to spiral any more than it already has. “After April 25, we will review the situation and take further decisions.” Bhargava said that the escalating Covid-19 positivity rate in the city and shortage of hospital beds, oxygen ventilators, medicines and other medical facilities was alarming many traders like him. However, Chamber of Trade and Industry chairman Brajesh Goel claimed that except for a few shops on main Chandni Chowk road, rest of the shops in the area will remain open. “There has been no direction from the government to keep the markets closed. I have also spoken to the president of Delhi Hindustan Mercantile Association, which has 27,000 shopkeepers as its members. He assured that 25,000 shops in the area will be open from Monday,” Goel added. Goel claimed that Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapaar Mandal has only 250 members and the closure of these shops should not affect others in the market. General secretary of Sadar Bazar Traders Association Devraj Baweja claimed that unlike main markets in Chandni Chowk, other major trade associations including paper, electrical, electronics, radio, among others in east Delhi have announced the closure of markets from Monday till April 25. Ashish Grover, member of Delhi Pharmaceutical Traders Associations, Bhagirath Palace, said that they have convened a meeting on Monday to take a decision on the issue. “Many business organisations are closing markets till April 25 to stop the chain of infection. Confederation of All India Traders has convened a video conference on Monday to take a final decision,” said CAIT secretary general Praveen Khandelwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/traders-talk-in-2-voices-over-markets-closure/articleshow/82134378.cms||Vibha Sharma

With Covid treatment slowly moving outside hospitals, Covid care centres are opening up in the city once again and are already seeing a huge demand. “We have been getting requests from patients to set up home care set up for oxygen. This is not difficult to set up if one can secure an oxygen cylinder. In the recent days, I have assisted three families to set it up for their patients. They were apprehensive of going to a hospital and in one case, the patient was previously treated at home when he was infected during the first wave,” said a general physician in Mehdipatnam area. Also, demand for isolation centres and Covid care centres is increasing. “We already have a lot of queries coming to us. We are setting up a Covid care centre which will be at a subsidised rate in a few days from now,” said Sunil Jain, from the Jain International Trade Organization (JITO) which had run a similar centre during the first wave of the pandemic. Meanwile, many hoax messages of Covid centres are currently circulating on social media, said patients.

Experts have, however, suggested that despite the threat, keeping a positive mindset would go a long way in overcoming difficult times. Vidhya Nair, a Delhi-based psychologist and holistic doctor, said the pandemic has taken a toll on mental health of many people. “Various psycho-social factors, such as economic hardship, personal losses, lockdown, job insecurity and constant media barrage about the pandemic have affected people of different age groups. Most common conditions, such as anxiety, nervousness and feeling of hopelessness are triggered by fear of infecting other family members, physical distancing, loneliness, prolonged quarantine and confinement at home,” she said. Nair added learning to cope with stress and accepting the situation are the best possible ways to stay positive under the current circumstances. “People should also maintain personal hygiene,” she added. Dr Binda Singh, a city-based clinical psychologist, said though following Covid-appropriate behaviour is necessary, one should not be obsessed about it. “Excessive disinfection, hand washing, constant fear of catching virus and nervousness over slightest misconduct indicate an obsession which should be avoided,” she said. Mental health experts said lack of face-to-face interactions for elderly, disruption of healthy work life balance due to remote work for young adults and online classes for children are the major problems. Vinay Kumar, a psychotherapist, said maintaining distance from negative people is important for everyone, especially homemakers. “Taking a step back from household chores and reflecting on personal health is important for homemakers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/stay-away-from-negativity-during-pandemic-experts/articleshow/82133230.cms||---

According to the state health department data, altogether 12,978 people have tested for Covid-19 in Bhagalpur till Saturday and 102 of them died of the infection. The district had 2722 active cases on Sunday. Bhagalpur civil surgeon Dr Umesh Sharma on Sunday said the second wave of Covid-19 is severe. “Several doctors of Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital (JLNMCH), paramedical staff, doctors associated with private nursing homes and hospitals as well as nursing staff are infected with the virus and are hospitalized or home quarantined. We have prepared Covid centres at Teachers Training College (TTC) near Ghanta Ghar and Sadar hospital having 100 beds for corona patients,” he said. The previous JLNMCH superintendent, Dr Asim Kumar Das, has also tested positive, following which Dr Kumar Gaurav was made in-charge superintendent of the hospital. Dr Gaurav said the ICU is full with 164 patients. “There is no shortage of oxygen or medicines for the treatment of Covid patients. We are doing our level best to provide medicare to patients coming to JLNMCH, which has been declared as dedicated Covid hospital,” he said. Bhagalpur DM Subrat Kumar Sen reviewed the situation with district officials, private nursing homes and hospitals on Saturday. “Private doctors and hospitals management have agreed to provide maximum number of beds for Covid patients at the government rates as per Covid-19 protocols,” the DM said.

Some people also performed rituals at their rooftops in view of alarming rise in Covid-19 cases in the state. Neelam Raj, a resident of Hanuman Nagar, said she missed going to Ganga ghat to perform Chhath rituals. “Hope I will be able to go to the ghat the next time. I prayed to the Sun God to end the pandemic,” she added. Gautam Kumar, who used to visit his native village for Chhath puja, cancelled his plans this time owing to the pandemic. “I have been experiencing body pain for the last three days. Hence, I cancelled my plans to leave the city at the last minute,” he added. Priyanshi Singh, a resident of Kankarbagh, said she celebrated the festival this time with family and close friends. “The festival was unusually quite this time,” she added. Street vendors selling Chhath articles were a disappointed lot following drop in sales due to the pandemic. “I sold only four clay stoves this time as opposed to 17 last year,” said one Ramesh Lal who was seen waitig for customers near Malahi Pakri Chowk. Suman Kumar, a coconut seller, said, “I had bought 100 coconuts in view of the festival.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Fresh disciplinary action against ABV for ‘derogatory comments’||VIJAYAWADA: The state government on Sunday initiated fresh disciplinary proceedings against former intelligence chief AB Venkateswara Rao for allegedly making derogatory comments against the investigating officers in the case of alleged irregularities in the procurement of surveillance equipment. A government order in this regard was issued by chief secretary Adityanath Das under Rule 7 of the All India Service (Conduct) Rules, 1968 which states, “no member of the service shall, in any radio broadcast or communication over any public media published anonymously or in any communication to the press or in any public utterance, make any statement of fact or opinion which has the effect of an adverse criticism of any current or recent policy or action of the central government or a state government.” This charge of misconduct and misbehaviour was levelled against Rao citing his media interaction on April 4 accusing him of making 'derogatory comments' against the investigating officers in his case. The GO cites some of his allegations that during the course of the investigation, the ACB threatened the witnesses, reports have been submitted with false information, created forged e-file, he was implicated in the case with a mala fide intention etc. The order also directs Rao to submit a written statement of his defence and also state whether he desires to be heard in person, within 30 days. Earlier, deputy inspector-general (technical services) and spokesperson for AP police, G Palaraju, on Sunday alleged that former intelligence chief AB Venkateswara Rao had pressurised then Kadapa SP, Rahul Dev Sharma, in YS Vivekananda murder case. Addressing a press conference here on Sunday, Palaraju reacted to the letter sent by the suspended IPS officer to the CBI claiming he had information pertaining to the case. Palaraju said the letter by Venkateswara Rao was against All-India Service (AIS) rules and tantamounts to ‘misconduct’. Pointing to the timeline of the case, Palaraju alleged that Venkateswara Rao was running the entire investigation and passing orders to Rahul Dev Sharma and other officers back in March 2019. Dev Sharma, who was at the press conference, supported the allegation of Palaraju. “I was there for a period of 12 days before I got transferred and during the course of collecting evidence, there was pressure in taking action and arrests of certain individuals,” Dev Sharma alleged. “For 15 days after the murder, Rao was running the entire investigation and passing orders to the then Kadapa SP and others. Why didn’t he use important information that he had on the murder when he was an active part of the investigation?,” Palaraju wondered. He also questioned the timing of the letter and pointed that for three months after the murder, the TDP was in power. “Nine months after the present government took over the case was with us. Since the last one year, it has been with the CBI. What took ABV more than two years to come out with this information?,” Palaraju asked. Palaraju found fault with Rao for allegedly leaking the letter to the public domain “causing unrest among people regarding the case”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/fresh-disciplinary-action-against-abv-for-derogatory-comments/articleshow/82132991.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

GMC commissioner C Anuradha instructed ward administrative secretaries to ensure that secretaries in their respective offices get vaccinated without fail. The commissioner asked administrative secretaries to submit a report about the progress of the vaccination programme for secretaries by 6 pm, Monday. “All those who have not taken the vaccine should produce a medical certificate,” the GMC commissioner directed, adding that it has been made mandatory for all secretaries to take the vaccine as per government instructions. The commissioner directed secretaries to visit the nearest vaccination centre in ward secretariats and get the jab without fail. “Disciplinary action will be initiated against administrative secretaries who failed to submit a detailed report along with the medical certificates of those who have taken the vaccine,” said the commissioner. The Centre has announced that the vaccination programme is voluntary and not mandatory. However, the GMC has been making attempts to tweak the instructions on the issue. Earlier, the GMC threatened the staffers with withholding their salaries if they did not take the vaccine. However, it withdrew the circular following a report in TOI. Health department principal secretary (Covid-19 vaccination programme) Muddada Ravichandra, however, said vaccination would be completely voluntary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/guntur-civic-body-makes-jabs-mandatory-for-staff/articleshow/82133010.cms||Samdani MN
---||Delhi||Five questions regarding Remdesivir you wanted answered||India is facing an acute shortage of Remdesivir, an injectable anti-viral drug, in the wake of the spiralling Covid-19 cases. The Centre has banned its export, states are sending special flights to get it from the manufacturers, and there have been protests against the shortage. But how crucial is the drug really? Dr Neeraj Nischal, additional professor, internal medicine at AIIMS, explains to Durgesh Nandan JhaHow crucial is Remdesivir in the treatment of Covid patients?Remdesivir is an anti-viral drug that has been repurposed from the Ebola pandemic. It works by incorporating itself into the genetic material of the virus and prevents the replicating enzyme from making new copies of the virus. The mechanism appears very promising, but the actual effect on patients is not so. Thinking Remdesivir as a miracle cure for Covid is wrong. In fact, most patients don’t require remdesivir for surviving this disease. The Centre has flagged the “irrational use” of the drug. Do all patients need it?Remdesivir was given emergency-use authorisation for its use in the management of Covid. Since then, it has been indiscriminately used in Covid patients, leading to scarcity. The use of Remdesivir for treatment of Covid has very specific indications. It is beneficial only in a very small subset (in terms of shortening the time to recovery by approximately five days) of patients early in the disease and on low-flow oxygen. Outside this group of patients, Remdesivir really is not much better than placebo for Covid. The decision to use it should be based on the clinical status of a patient and not his social status. Though the drug is only supposed to be supplied to hospitals, chemists had been selling it. What happens if a Covid patient who doesn’t need Remdesivir is given the drug?Remdesivir is an injectable drug that has to be administered by the intravenous route. The drug itself may cause an allergic reaction, which may be life-threatening in some people. IV cannulation itself can predispose a patient to unnecessary risks of clots in the veins. It has side effects on the heart and liver, which so far seem to be reversible, but we cannot be sure as the mechanism is not known.  The US Food and Drug Administration had approved it as the first drug to treat Covid last year, but WHO says there is still no evidence that Remdesivir is beneficial in treating hospitalised coronavirus patients… The jury is still out. The US FDA has given approval for the use of this drug in hospitalised patients (their admission criteria is different from ours in daily practice). The WHO-Solidarity trial (of which AIIMS Delhi was a part) and a meta-analysis of four trials on Remdesivir did not show any overall benefit of Remdesivir. One of the studies that was evaluated in the meta-analysis (the ACTT-2 trial), has shown fewer deaths in patients receiving Remdesivir who were on low-flow oxygen. The studies on Remdesivir were not all designed the same, and this group of patients on low-flow oxygen was only studied in this particular trial. The drug may be effective when used logically, but not when used indiscriminately. Remdesivir is a repurposed drug originally meant to treat Hepatitis C and then Ebola. What are its side effects?Remdesivir is an injectable drug, and some people might have an infusion reaction to it. This usually manifests as some mild rashes or itching. However, in rare cases, it may lead to breathing difficulties and cardiovascular collapse as well. It may have very specific side effects on the heart where it can cause bradycardia (low heart rate), which may sometimes be wrongly attributed to Covid. It can cause pain in the abdomen, nausea and vomiting. It can cause derangement of blood sugar, liver enzymes as well as kidney function tests. This is not necessarily a complete list of possible side effects and data is still emerging. The interaction of this drug with other drugs is still not well defined.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/five-questions-regarding-remdesivir-you-wanted-answered/articleshow/82134395.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

The residents of these villages fear that the rising number of Covid cases will invariably lead to shortage of life-saving essential like Covid beds, ventilators, oxygen cylinders and even medicines. The decision to observe the janata curfews come against the backdrop of the authorities failing to convince the residents to stay indoors. Most small markets and streets in the villages continue to see crowding. Also, there is hardly any presence of police and administrative staff to enforce the Covid restrictions. One such village is Yelavi, in Tasgaon taluka of Sangli district, which has been reporting 2-3 daily Covid deaths in recent times. The villagers here have now decided to keep only milk and medicine shops open for two hours in morning and evening but shut all other essential shops. When asked about the unilateral decision taken by the village panchayat to implement a janata curfew, Sangli district collector Abhijeet Chaudhary said: “We will not interfere if the decision is unanimous. If there is any opposition from any section, it is advisable to follow the government’s Covid restrictions.” Many villages in Satara districts too are preparing to observe janata curfews. Some are opting for 7-day janata curfews while others are choosing weekend curfews. The village administrations, however, make sure that the supply basic essentials — such as milk and medicines — is continued. Satara district collector Shekhar Singh said: “We have no problem with a janata curfew as long as the essential services are kept operational for the convenience of the villager residents.” The government has allowed ration shops, bakeries, confectionaries, poultry, mutton and even pet shops to stay open during the 15-day period of strict Covid restrictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/villages-pick-janata-curfew-to-keep-infection-at-bay/articleshow/82132246.cms||---

Talking to TOI, K Shanmugam, 34, one of the protesters, said 700 workers were employed with the firm. Dr Soundammal, deputy director of health services, said they had subjected all the employees to Covid-19 testing. “Sixty-nine of them have been infected with the virus. Health department workers have disinfected the premises of the firm.” Pointing out that many workers of the firm had visited nearby shops to buy essentials and other items, S Sybudin, revenue divisional officer, said they had directed nearly 300 shop owners to down their shutters until further orders. “Sanitary workers have sprayed the street and shop premises with disinfectants.” The villagers said the cattle feed firm was still functioning round-the-clock. “Officials have also not taken any steps so far to close the firm that has become a Covid-19 hotspot. It should be closed for a few days to contain the virus spread,” Shanmugam said. The villagers withdrew the protest after officials assured to take steps to close the firm. Meanwhile, DMK cadres called for a demonstration on Tuesday, if the cattle feed firm was not shut on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/erode/with-69-cases-cattle-feed-firm-in-erode-turns-covid-cluster/articleshow/82134396.cms||---

Last Sunday, more than 45,000 people were given their jabs. Officials said only 312 vaccination sites were active this Sunday in the district, compared to the total of 381 last week. They added that turnouts have reduced due to the weekend curfew in the region. A total of 24,493 people were vaccinated across the district on Sunday. Pune rural clocked the highest vaccination numbers at 9,560. It was followed by PMC areas (8,412) and the PCMC (at 6,521). More than 1,900 beneficiaries were given Covaxin, while around 22,559 got Covishield. Officials from the health department said they were expecting numbers to go up on Sunday after the arrival of 1 lakh Covishield and 15,000 Covaxin doses the day before. Sanjog Kadam, deputy director, health services, Pune circle, said, “Low turnouts could be due to the weekend curbs. But we were expecting this over the weekends. During the weekdays, we have an average of 50,000 daily jabs in the district.” He said the region got around 3 lakh vaccine doses last week. “We are expecting another consignment of doses this week, starting on Monday,” he said. Kadam said low vaccine supply was another reason for the drop in coverage. “We had hit a high of 85,000 daily jabs. But weak supply has forced us to restructure targets,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/just-over-24k-get-jabs-as-weekend-curbs-slow-pace/articleshow/82134391.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The farmers had gathered under the banner of Haryana Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) (Charuni). The Kurukshetra district administration had made tight security arrangements such as barricading the venue and deploying a riot squad. When the farmers reached the venue, a team led by additional superintendent of police (ASP) Ravinder Singh Tomar talked to them and directed them to the designated rally ground near the Theme Park. Social distancing went for a toss at the BJP event in KurukshetraRaising slogans against the BJP and its government at the Haryana and Central government, the farmers crossed the barricades but police managed to stop them short of the venue. BKU Haryana’s Jasbir Singh Mamumajra said: "The government is acting biased. Why are the Covid-19 guidelines imposed on the farmers and general public not imposed on the BJP functions. The BJP function was huge and to oppose it was our right." Additional superintendent of police Ravinder said: "The farmers had promised to protest peacefully and not disturb the event, so we gave them a space in the Theme Park, but they jumped over the police barricades and we had to arrest 60, whom we, later, released on the magistrate’s orders.

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Suspecting affair, man runs truck over 2 daughters before killing self||PUNE: A truck owner, who suspected his 18-year-old daughter of having an affair and her 14-year-old sister of supporting her, ran over both of them with his vehicle and killed himself at Indori village near Talegaon Dabhade, about 45km from Pune, on Sunday morning. “We have recovered a note, purportedly written by the man, near his body stating that he was taking the drastic step as he was not happy with his elder daughter’s behaviour. The note added that no one should be held responsible for their deaths,” senior inspector Pradip Londhe of the Talegaon MIDC police told TOI. Londhe said the man’s wife, in her complaint, stated that her husband was upset with his eldest daughter for chatting with someone over the cellphone. “The family had a discussion about it on Saturday. About an hour past Saturday midnight, the man got up in a fit of rage and woke up the two girls and forced them out of the house. He made them sleep on an internal road in front of the house,” Londhe said. By this time, the wife and their youngest daughter aged five woke up and saw the man forcing the two girls to sleep on the road and starting the truck. The horrified wife ran to a relative’s house nearby to seek help, but by the time she returned, the man had allegedly run over his two daughters and ended his life too, Londhe said, citing the FIR. “Based on the note and the circumstances, we suspect that after running over his daughters, the man jumped out of the truck which was moving at slow speed and threw himself in front of the vehicle. We are verifying these aspects,” Londhe told TOI. The police have registered an offence of murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/suspecting-affair-man-runs-truck-over-2-daughters-before-killing-self/articleshow/82134403.cms||---

---||Aurangabad||MSEDCL starts issuing disconnection notices||Aurangabad: The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) has started sending SMSes carrying disconnection notices to consumers who owe dues of more than two months. The stern measure, which asks for payment of dues within 15 days, has evoked sharp criticism with a section of consumers citing weak financial condition due to the pandemic situation and curbs associated with it. As per section 56 (1) of the Indian Electricity Act (IEA) 2003, it is mandatory for MSEDCL to serve notices to consumer 15 days prior to the disconnection. To comply with the laid down norm, the state power utility establishes necessary communication through registered mobile number of consumers. “There exist genuine reasons for consumers for non-payment of power bill. The MSEDCL cannot go hammer and tong against such consumers who are at the receiving end of Covid-19 in many ways,” said Asha Majalgaokar, a consumer from the CIDCO area said. The MSEDCL Aurangabad zone, which covers Aurangabad and Jalna districts, has over 6.83 lakh residential consumers besides over 70,000 commercial and industrial consumers, among other categories. When contacted, acting chief engineer for Aurangabad zone of MSEDCL Sanjay Akode said that the SMSes in question carrying disconnection notices are being sent to defaulter consumers through the central system. “These are system-generated messages which get shoot by default if consumers fail to pay their bills for around two months. It will be policy decision of the state government whether to carry out recovery drive during the current pandemic,” he said. Notably, the recovery of power bills and possible waiver had stoked major controversy last year during the first-wave of Covid-19 with different ruling party leaders taking different stands. Eventually, consumers were made to pay dues in instalments among other easy options without any waiver.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/msedcl-starts-issuing-disconnection-notices/articleshow/82132258.cms||---

Saying that the country’s Covid situation is worrisome, Chadha said that while India had breached the 2-lakh daily mark in daily cases, BJP had been focusing on conducting rallies with huge crowds in West Bengal. “Winning elections and collecting votes is their sole motive, BJP has nothing to do with the people of India and their lives,” he alleged.“Under the leadership of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi government is working relentlessly round-the-clock to contain Covid. BJP under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah is busy conducting gigantic rallies and roadshows that could be potential super-spreaders,” Chadha claimed.On April 6, when India lodged nearly 1,15,000 Covid cases and 630 deaths, Modi conducted two rallies in West Bengal and the next day, when 1,26,00 cases and more than 684 deaths were recorded, Shah attended four rallies in West Bengal, the MLA said. Elections will be won and lost, parties may come and go, but the lives of people will not, said Chadha. “Today the people of the country want the Centre to leave election management aside, and render full focus on the Covid-19 management.” Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said that even during the Covid crisis, AAP is indulging in petty politics. “When the Centre is supporting all states to fight Covid, it is regretful that AAP is indulging in petty political allegations to divert attention from its failures,” he alleged. The people of Delhi, Gupta said, “very well know that the Centre’s hospitals like AIIMS, Safdarjung and RML are the city’s biggest support and, by setting up a huge temporary hospital near Chhatarpur through DRDO in record four days, the central government has extended major support”.AAP functionary Durgesh Pathak alleged that while the BJP-run corporations had around 3,127 hospital beds in Delhi, they had not provided a single bed for Covid patients of Delhi.Refuting the allegation, BJP’s Praveen Shankar Kapoor said while North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s Hindu Rao Hospital had opened a Covid ward with 200 beds, many other civic hospitals were ready to offer beds and were awaiting the approval of the Delhi government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/chadha-targets-bjp-says-its-sole-motive-is-winning-polls/articleshow/82134411.cms||---

The Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) in Aurangabad has kept aside 1,500 vials of the injection that will now be provided to the private hospitals through a centralised process monitored by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) and the district administration. FDA drug inspector Rajgopal Bajaj, the officer supervising the supply of remdesivir from the GMCH, said private hospitals can take remdesivir stocks on a loan. “These hospitals will have to return the injections to the GMCH as and when the supply of remdesivir is restored,” he said. As a part of the new procedure, private hospitals will have to inform the FDA and the district administration — via its help centre on 0240-2331200 — of their daily remdesivir requirement along with a list of patients before 6 pm every day. “In the wake of the acute remdesivir shortage, hospitals have been told to reserve the injection doses for critical patients only. Patients’ relatives have been requested not to approach the help centre or the FDA officials,”Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan said during a review meeting on Sunday. Aurangabad district has reported almost a 10-fold rise in remdesivir use by the second week of April in comparison to usage on March 11. Dr Praveen Surywanshi, the president of the association of private hospitals in Marathwada, said: “Patients or their families should not insist on remdesivir injections. They should let the treating doctors take a call.” Surywanshi said a group of hospitals in Aurangabad have teamed up to arrange for remdesivir stocks from Pune. “We are now sending a private vehicle every day to Pune to get the supply. The available supply is distributed among the hospitals,” he said. Shiv Sena MLC Ambadas Danve said the demand for remdesivir supply has been raised with the state government. “Aurangabad is expected to get the supply shortly. When compared to other major cities, the dearth of the injection is felt in Aurangabad only now. The issue will be resolved once the state-level supply is streamlined ,” he said. Local MLA Sanjay Shirsath could not be reached for his comments despite repeated attempts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-runs-out-of-remdesivir-gmch-to-loan-the-drug-to-pvt-hosps/articleshow/82132262.cms||Prasad Joshi

---||Pune||Walking indoors helps citizens achieve daily target steps, stay fit||Pune: The implementation of curbs at night has urged many working professionals to make accommodations to their fitness regime according to their work schedule. After completing his work from home shift, Rahul Chandani would go for a brisk walk at 8 pm. “Since I get off work only by 7 pm, it is not possible for me to go for my daily walks outside. Hence, I spot walk at home for 15-20 minutes. I have started skipping for another 10 minutes. This regime gives me the cardio workout I need,” he said. Customer service executive Shweta Lal said, “I have to be on calls from 12 noon to 8 pm. I would take a walk in my locality, or in the society premises after dinner for half an hour but I cannot do that since curfew has been implemented. With such tight rules, I prefer to get my steps in at home where I walk briskly from one room to another, sometimes making variations in the route. The silver lining is that I don’t have to wear a mask while I walk around in my house.” “Spot walking or jogging is a good way to get the step count up during the curfew. The 6 pm curb is inconvenient for many working professionals, who are on duty during the period. Instead of foregoing their walks entirely, they can consider spot walking or jogging. Making sure that you do enough cardio exercises is important to do 30 minutes of moderate cardiovascular exercises such as brisk walking or jogging,” said Ruchi Sethia, physical trainer. Fitness consultant Anmol Singh suggested, “People living in smaller apartments can do spot walking or jogging. Working professionals can also integrate spot walking/jogging into their schedules. For example, when they are taking calls, they can spot walk instead of standing or sitting in one place.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/walking-indoors-helps-citizens-achieve-daily-target-steps-stay-fit/articleshow/82134418.cms||---

According to the Coimbatore district general secretary of AITUC Construction Workers Union, N Selvaraj, the brick manufacturers have increased the prices of bricks and the state government should intervene immediately to control the price hike. “In the recent days, the construction materials – cement, thermo-mechanically treated (TMT) bars and other raw materials prices have increased drastically and the construction work has been crippling due to the price hike.

Asking the promoters to furnish the details in a stipulated format, MahaRERA invoked the enabling provisions of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, which has been in force since May 2017.

---||Allahabad||Boatmen, vendors, priests at Sangam struggle for livelihood amid absence of pilgrims||Prayagraj: There has been a strident decline in the strength of visitors in Prayagraj since the cases of coronavirus surged in UP and other parts of the country in the past fortnight. Due to this, priests, boatmen and vendors selling flowers and other puja items, who majorly cater to pilgrims, are finding it difficult to earn their livelihoods. President of Prayagraj Navik Sangh, Pappu Nishad, told TOI, “The drastic fall in the number of visitors owing to the sudden spike in Covid cases has left us struggling with our daily expenditure.” “The families of around 1,500 boatmen of Prayagraj rely on the arrival of pilgrims for their livelihood. They are currently living hand to mouth amid the second wave of Covid-19,” he added. Nishad further said, “There is hardly 1% visitors at Sangam these days. Even locals are not visiting the banks of Ganga and Yamuna due to Covid fear.” The absence of a large number of visitors arriving from states like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerela to take holy dips in the Sangam, has forced the boatmen community to fight for their survival, said Nishad. Pradeep, a boatman, said, “A majority of the boatmen in the city are struggling to manage two square meals a day by catering to the few visitors who arrive to immerse the mortal remains of their loved ones. These visitors usually arrive at the Sangam campus by their private vehicles.” Pradeep demanded that the state government must initiate corrective measures for the families of boatmen and other vendors who solely depend on visitors to earn their living. The boatmen would again be debt-ridden and might even reach the verge of starvation if the situation remains the same for a long time, he added. Pushpa, a local vendor, said, “We have no other alternative source of livelihood. Within just a week, the footfall at Sangam has drastically declined, leaving us without work.” Kali, another flower vendor, said, “We are in a bad situation as we have to protect ourselves from the disease as well as earn our living. Absence of visitors would prove costly for our families. The local government must do something for us at the earliest.” Meanwhile, P N Pandey, a priest, said, “The only visitors seen these days are the ones arriving to immerse the ashes of their family member in the Sangam.

Scroll through Twitter, Facebook or Instagram, and you will find fervent pleas for ventilators, oxygen, ICU beds and Remdesivir dominating conversations. You will also find users discuss their deeply personal stories of loss and agonising battles of survival with the sly and relentless virus. Visuals of ambulances, patients’ names and hospitals, cremation pyres convey a sense of despondency across platforms. On Facebook, there were over 27,000 posts around #Remdesivir on Sunday. Most of these posts came from smaller cities, including Patna, Indore, Gorakhpur, among others, from those who could not find the in-demand injection in their local pharmacies. Similarly, on Instagram, Facebook’s photo sharing platform, there were over 13k posts about Remdesivir requirement. Some stories are heart-rending. On Twitter, a journalist in Uttar Pradesh live tweeted the drastic fall in his oxygen levels before he tragically passed away. One of the last photos he posted showed an oximeter attached to a finger with a reading of 31. His death was confirmed by a retired IAS official, with a verified account. A user from Madhya Pradesh posted about her experience of trying to find a bed for her mother, whose oxygen levels were drastically falling. Some users, with urgent requirements of medicines, tagged journalists and activists, hoping to reach the authorities and save their loved ones. Some posts also highlighted the crumbling health infrastructure. Yet there are also stories of hope, of people joining hands in these tough times for the greater good. A handle, Pandemic Relief List India, has started collating a list of pan-India resources consisting of ambulance service, hospitals, therapists and other community initiatives. Covid Warriors, a Facebook group comprising people from Delhi who have recovered from the coronavirus, was flooded with requests for plasma, with users posting requirements every hour on Sunday. Another pan-India group Covid19 Plasma Donor – Recipient Help India Group had over 130 posts every day over the last one week. Even on instant messaging platforms like Signal and WhatsApp, users sent requests for essentials required to fight the virus; plasma and Remdesivir being the most common. Resource tools, compiled on Google Doc, have also become extremely common, especially for the younger generation. The lists containing details of plasma centres, Remdesivir suppliers and hospitals with available beds, are being used by families of positive patients as a last resort.

During these nine days, the district has accounted for close to 30% cases of the state. Keeping in mind the spread of the virus – Gujarat on Sunday for the first time crossed the daily figure of 10,000 cases and 100 deaths – leaders of different walks of life on Sunday appealed to the citizens to keep themselves under ‘self-imposed lockdown.’ With over 21,000 active cases in the district, all private and government-run hospitals are nearly full to the capacity.

The police cordon had a lot of trouble containing the farmers. For the programme to proceed, the cops had to detain eight protest leaders and chase away their followers. During this time, the farmers also set a BJP flag on fire. The Bharatiya Janata Party had kept the guest list and the venue from the administration but the farmers came to know. The cops had to barricade Patel Nagar in quick time.

---||Chandigarh||PPCB not authorised to issue challans against violators of noise, water pollution rules||Ludhiana: In an interesting reply to the right to information (RTI) filed by city-based social activist Rajesh Gupta with Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), it has emerged that the department does not have powers to issue any challans for violation of any norms related to Noise Pollution Rules 2000 and Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974. According to the activist, the information was received a second appeal filed by him. Giving more information, Gupta said, “In reply filed before the State Information Commissioner by PPCB in regards to a RTI filed by me the department (PPCB) in an affidavit has stated that they have no powers to issue any challans against anyone found violating any norms. The information was revealed after a long battle during the second appeal and it took about nine months to reveal this information and everyone was shocked with the reply received from PPCB. As Ludhiana is facing serious issues of pollution and we are often called pollution capital of Punjab, the purpose of the RTI was to know from PPCB, that what action they take against any violates, but shockingly the PPCB has said, since they have no such power under the Act, hence no challans have been issued.” Gupta also added, “The issue was brought to my notice by many residents of Ludhiana that PPCB has just become den of corruption and nothing concrete is being done by them to check violations of various types of pollution. Perhaps, this is one of the reasons why the instances of noise pollution are increasing day by day in the city and the violators are having free run with no fear of action by the authorities as PPCB is totally toothless in this case and does not even have the provision of slapping fine on the violators. This is a very serious issue, and with the collective efforts of residents of Ludhiana this matter will be raised before high court, in a public interest litigation.” Notably, in the last few months, some residents have taken to social media to express their anguish over inaction by authorities in the case of some restaurants and private persons playing loud music in residential areas that too in the wee hours. Gupta meanwhile has claimed that he will take these violators to task even if PPCB and other authorities have failed to act in this context.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ppcb-not-authorised-to-issue-challans-against-violators-of-noise-water-pollution-rules/articleshow/82134423.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Surat||Have crocodiles made Tapi their homes in Surat?||Surat: After Vadodara's Vishwamitri, crocodiles seem to have made Surat’s Tapi River their new home in the last few years. With the number of crocodile sightings on the rise in and around Tapi, city-based Nature Club Surat along with Wildlife Trust of India and Forest Department has started a new capacity building project to mitigate the human-crocodile conflict in the city. The group also plans to carry out a population estimation exercise in near future. “In the last two years, around five to six crocodiles have been rescued from Tapi river banks. The sightings of the reptiles are increasing by the day. Though no untoward incident of human-crocodile conflict has been reported so far we want to prepare a database of the crocodiles. It will help us in carrying out various awareness activities and also in the conservation programmes. Next week, we are going to organize an online rescue training programme for volunteers on how to rescue crocodiles,” said Krunal Trivedi the coordinator of the project. “Once the Covid-19 situation becomes normal, we will organise hands-on training in association with the Surat zoo,” he added. According to Trivedi, crocodiles have been sighted at reliance Hazira, ABP Shipyard, ONGC Bridge in Magdalla, and Variyav among others areas close to Tapi River. Crocodile sightings near human habitations have gone up considerably, thus increasing the chances of human-crocodile conflict. At present the situation is not so grave in Surat but with the increase in the number of crocodiles, chances of friction between the reptiles and humans can’t be ruled out in future. In this project we will conduct a survey for crocodile presence and identify the potential human-crocodile conflict area.” Trivedi added. “We are already in touch with fishermen who operate along the Tapi. They often provide us information about crocodile sightings. We have also asked citizens to inform us if they spot a crocodile,” Trivedi said. Though an exact figure of the crocodile population is not available, according estimates, there could be over 20 crocodiles living in their natural habitat in and around Surat city. “Prior to the 2006 floods, there were no records of sighting or rescue of crocodiles in Surat city. But in the last few years, their numbers have gone up. So we need to study the issue for long term conservation of the reptiles,” Snehal Patel, President of Nature Club Surat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/have-crocodiles-made-tapi-their-homes-in-surat/articleshow/82133447.cms||---

---||Delhi||No Method To This Madness? How Online Mode Is Affecting Learning||New Delhi: Amid an alarming spiral of Covid cases, at least another semester at universities and colleges will continue in the online mode. Teachers say this has massively affected learning. With assessment at different universities being conducted through an online open-book exam (OBE) method, which is not proctored, it has led to the students not taking their studies seriously. A senior teacher at Delhi University said: “Offline exams are important to ascertain how much the students have learned. During online OBE, the answers get circulated on WhatsApp groups and many students tend to copy the answers. While evaluating the papers, we get to know about it. It’s the students who are serious about their studies suffer.” DS Rawat, dean of examination at DU, said online exams could not be a substitute for the offline mode. “But we cannot conduct a proctored examination. I had received emails from students that they had to travel several kilometres to get internet network. So, all these things need to be considered,” he said. But Rawat added that they had a system in place where if evaluators found that a few students might have copied an answer, they could flag it. “It is then treated as unfair means and, for looking into that, we have a committee.” Jamia Millia Islamia had tried to conduct a proctored examination earlier, but following protests, it had to revert to OBE. Nazim Hussain Jafri, controller of examination and registrar of Jamia, said that “online learning is no substitute for offline learning. The students are denied an opportunity to interact with teachers and peers. They often complain that they do not understand a lot of things. So, even if they are serious about studying, they are bogged down by the troubles of online learning”. He stated that OBE was also not a viable mode of evaluation as it didn’t maintain the integrity of exams. “We at Jamia had decided to conduct a proctored exam last year, but students objected to it. For OBE, students often rely on their books and notes, instead of studying properly.” The university might think of conducting proctored exams in the next semester, Jafri said. Former dean of students’ welfare at DU Gurpreet Singh Tuteja believes that DU has the means to conduct a proctored exam. “There are multiple software that are AI-based and can be used by universities like DU.” Tuteja said: “OBE goes against the principles of Bloom's Taxonomy, which is a set of hierarchical models used to classify educational learning objectives into levels of complexity and specificity. Students going through continuous evaluation is much better than relying on OBE.” Another teacher at Shri Ram College of Commerce said: “Many students have taken it for granted that they will either be promoted or have to appear for OBE. In the last one year, it will be very difficult to say how much knowledge students have actually gained.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-method-to-this-madness-how-online-mode-is-affecting-learning/articleshow/82134439.cms||Shradha Chettri

Apart from the work of linking Dwarka flyover with the new flyover being constructed opposite KK Wagh College to Jatra Hotel on the highway, NHAI has also taken up the work for widening the Sinnar -Shirdi highway last year. Dileep Patil, the project director of NHAI said, “The fear of lockdown was prevalent among the construction workers since the beginning of March as the district administration started imposing restrictions due to the spread of Covid. So, many construction workers, who are mainly from other parts of the state and the country, had started leaving for their home towns.” As of now, the construction works are being carried out by only 40 % of the workers.  Given the huge number of accidents and traffic snarls on the highway opposite K K Wagh College and Jatra hotel, a stretch of approximately 3.5 km, NHAI had taken up the work of constructing a flyover between these two locations in April 2018 and then linking it with the existing elevated corridor over Dwarka. While the earlier deadline for completing this work was October 2020, the pandemic hit and the construction was delayed. Now, when it was just a matter of linking the two flyovers and throwing the elevated corridor open for traffic, the project has again been hit by the second wave of Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/2nd-wave-of-covid-hits-2-nhai-projects-in-nashik/articleshow/82132301.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Officials from the PCMC said last-minute transfers of such patients - from private to civic-run hospitals - puts lives at risk and applies strain on hospital staff receiving these referrals. Rajesh Patil, commissioner of the PCMC said, "We have seen that many times, critically ill patients suffered a lot during transport. Such practices can result in death. There's also the problem of shortage of beds at civic-run facilities. Those who've been transferred at the last minute have to wait a long time for medical attention. Ideally, a critical patient who is already on ventilator support should not be moved to any other facility.” Patil added that the PCMC is working to improve bed availability. “We are going to add at least 100 more ventilator-supported ICU beds at civic facilities within the next 10 days. If we get more ventilators, they will be allocated to private hospitals that have the manpower,” he said. On Sunday, the virtual bed dashboard showed only one available ICU bed with ventilator support, out of 384 such beds in PCMC limits. Officials in the PMC and Pune rural administration said no such patient transport advisory has been issued to private hospitals in their jurisdictions. Pune mayor Muralidhar Mohol said the administration will add more beds. Ayush Prasad, the chief executive officer of the Pune zilla parishad said, “We have a strict referral policy. If a patient requires urgent specialised care, she/he can be transferred along with all relevant medical records so that the receiving hospital can resume treatment accordingly." Prasad said the administration is aware of instances in which private hospitals transferred critically ill patients to avoid on-site deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-advisory-asks-pvt-hospitals-not-to-transport-seriously-ill-patients/articleshow/82134443.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: A separate barrack & subdued iftaar at Arthur Rd jail this yr||Mumbai: The Arthur Road jail has created a separate Roza barrack for inmates who fast during Ramzan. The breakfast to inmates in this barrack is given at around 3.30am till 4.30 am as part of Saheri. But this year, due to lockdown, there won’t be any iftaar get-together for other inmates in the jail. Before the lockdown, many Hindu prisoners prepared iftaar for co-inmates, demonstrating brotherhood and affection in the jail. They would bring fruits, make different plates for dozens of inmates, sit next to Rozadaar prisoners and eat together when they broke fast. However, this year only those observing Ramzan will be part of the Roza barrack. Those staying in this barrack and fasting will have different timings for breakfast and dinner than the regular inmates. While the regular inmates get breakfast at 7am, those fasting eat between 3am and 4.45am.“The purpose for this barrack is that with all those fasting kept in one place, it becomes easier to provide food at midnight and for iftaar. Earlier, people from different barracks would participate in iftaar but due to Covid, it won’t be done this year,” said a jail official. During the month of Ramzan, non-vegeterian food will also be available in the jail canteen, and an inmate can buy it from there. Currently, non-veg food is being prepared in the jail canteen only once a week. In the Roza barrack, many inmates are seen offering prayers, chanting tasbih (beads) and reading Quaran. They all start preparation for iftaar after the 5.30pm namaz. Some inmates buy additional fruits from the jail canteen, bring it to their barracks and accordingly everything is set. The regular jail food is served to them in the evening which they eat after breaking the fast.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-a-separate-barrack-subdued-iftaar-at-arthur-rd-jail-this-yr/articleshow/82135254.cms||Mateen Hafeez

Rangasamy of Selvapuram, who was staying on the encroached land, had built the Shiva temple 40 years ago. The city corporation demolished Rangasamy’s house three years ago and provided him a house at Arivozhi Nagar near Kovaipudur. When corporation officials attempted to demolish the temple, Hindu Munnani cadres had opposed the move.The civic body deployed more than 50 police personnel at the site before launching the demolition drive on Sunday. They arrested 25 Hindu Munnani cadres who opposed the drive. When police shifted them to a police vehicle, M Karthik, 24, of Selvapuram, damaged the interior of the vehicle. He was booked under Section 143 (unlawful assembly), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the Indian Penal Code, read with section 3 (i) of the Tamil Nadu Property (Prevention of Damage and Loss) Act. Police arrested Karthik and remanded him in judicial custody. Rest of the HM men were let off later.After demolishing the illegal structure, corporation officials removed three idols from there and kept them at the corporation office at Town Hall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/temple-on-encroached-land-demolished/articleshow/82133453.cms||---

The women, some as young as 18, were forced to work against their will at the unit, revenue department sources said. “They are natives of Rayagada district in Odisha and had arrived at the unit last December for a three-month training programme. They did not get adequate remuneration from the company and after completing the programme, were forced to stay back. After the women sought help, their parents alerted authorities in Odisha, who contacted Tirupur city police commissioner G Karthikeyan on Saturday night. A team from the social welfare department, directorate of industrial safety and health, revenue department and Velampalayam police searched the unit on Sunday morning and rescued the women,” said a police officer. The women were shifted to a marriage hall. They will be sent to Odisha by train on Monday. An inquiry has been initiated against the firm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/19-odisha-women-rescued-from-garment-factory/articleshow/82133450.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh may face stricter curbs if Covid surge continues||CHANDIGARH: If the spike in Covid-19 cases continues, be prepared for stricter restrictions. The warning came from UT adviser Manoj Parida on Sunday. “The situation will be reviewed during the war room meeting in the next few days. If there is no improvement, residents should be ready to face curbs stricter than the weekend lockdown,” Parida told TOI. “People need to understand that following Covid protocol and behaviour is one of the crucial steps in combating this rampaging virus,” he said, adding the administration has planned to increase vaccination by taking it to a wider scale. The administration has also asked PGI to enhance its capacity to accommodate more patients, he said, while assuring health infrastructure was good. “We have adequate medical infrastructure, but PGI has been told to raise its capacity. We have plenty of vaccines and medicines. Since it is a medical emergency, we are monitoring the situation. All required decisions will be taken in the war room meeting to be chaired by Punjab governor and UT administrator V P Singh Badnore,” Parida said. Sources in the administration said private laboratories were conducting the majority of sample collection work owing to limited resources in the government sector. “Private labs are collecting samples and giving it to the hospitals to conduct the test. Results are being given by the government health institutions. Only PGI and Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, are able to conduct the tests,” sources said. Parida backs Tricity lockdown for 2 days Emphasising on a simultaneous weekend lockdown in the Tricity, UT adviser Manoj Parida said, “Lockdown needs to be imposed at the same time in the Tricity, else restrictions will not solve any purpose. It is the need the hour. This will help us manage the situation,” Parida said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/city-may-face-stricter-curbs-if-covid-surge-continues/articleshow/82132840.cms||Deepak Yadav

Pawar was addressing online while inaugurating the 295-bedded Covid care centre (CCC) in Nashik city, which has been set up by the Bhujbal Knowledge City, Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), NCP and Akhil Bhartiya Samta Parishad. Praising the joint efforts of the education institute, local body and NCP, Pawar said the state is going through a phase of Covid and the situation is not so good. “Government and the health sectors are taking all the efforts to provide every support to Covid patients, but at the same time industries, co-operative and educational institutes should help the local and district authorities in creating health infrastructure,” said Pawar. A CCC has been set up at the Meenatai Thackeray stadium along the NH-3 in Panchavati division of Nashik city. “Apart from the general beds, we have also made plans for oxygen beds in the CCC. Of the 295 beds, there are 180 beds with oxygen and the remaining are general beds. We have set up large oxygen cylinders to provide oxygen to the patients. Moreover, adequate health staff has been deployed at the CCC here,” said district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal. Nashik divisional commissioner Radhakrishna Game, Nashik municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav, district collector Suraj Mandhare, commissioner of police Deepak Pandey, Nashik ZP CEO Leena Banso and other senior officials were present on the occasion||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/pawar-calls-upon-industries-to-help-during-crisis/articleshow/82132321.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Delhi||Proctored exams can take cheating out of picture, but tech issues a major concern||New Delhi: As universities prepare for prolonged online education and online open-book exams, those critical of the sanctity of such evaluation systems for “promoting rote learning” are instead suggesting proctored exams as a viable option. In this alternative process, students write their exams at homes with the camera of their electronic device on. Institutions then either use a human proctor or artificial intelligence processes to check cheating. Delhi Technological University conducted proctored exams for 2,500 final-year BTech and MTech students last year. “We are the flagbearers of this form of examinations,” claimed Kamal Pathak, DTU controller of examinations. He said the preference to conduct the final-year exams in this format and not in Delhi University-favoured OBE format was “to maintain the integrity and credibility of the exams”. DTU used a third-party artificial intelligence proctored platform for recording live video, images and the screens of the candidates. “The computer screens of the students are shared with the help of software, so if any student tries to use Google, for example, a warning is sent to them,” explained Pathak. There was manual invigilation online too, with one teacher monitoring 25 examinees. However, DTU has changed its evaluation pattern and will not conduct exams this year, relying instead “on continuous evaluation” to assess performance. “This gives us a better idea of their progress,” said Pathak. At Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, exams for over 96,000 students were conducted in the proctored format. “We had 550 proctors and they could see the students in their rooms during the exam,” said Prodyut Bhattacharya, controller of examinations. “We didn’t want open-book exams and decided to go for an AI-proctored exam. We did not charge the students anything extra for this. They also benefited by not having to travel to write the exam papers.” Jamia Millia Islamia had announced human-enabled proctored exams, but the students objected on the grounds that many students did not have laptops or computers. Ambedkar University Delhi too decided against AI-proctored exams after setting up a committee to explore that option. Private universities were the first to take the step in this direction. At Bennett University, the administration is not worried about the surging wave of Covid infections and is going ahead with the already notified exam schedule. Sudhanshu Verma, COO, Bennett University, said, “We had already planned for proctored exams.” Verma, however, added that while the sanctity of exams wasn’t affected by OBE “because exams have to test knowledge and are driven towards scoring based on what is given in textbooks”, today’s potential employers looked for knowledge above and beyond textbooks. Last year, OP Jindal University also conducted its LSAT law entrance test in an AI-enabled remote-proctored manner. AT BML Munjal University too, Jaskiran Arora, associate dean, academic operations, stated that in his institution, much like last year, “the exams will be conducted in an AI-proctored environment where the student's attainment of the learning outcomes can be assessed in a fair manner and the sanctity of the exams maintained”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/proctored-exams-can-take-cheating-out-of-picture-but-tech-issues-a-major-concern/articleshow/82134453.cms||Mohammad Ibrar
---||Dehradun||Rising Covid cases spell doom for tourism industry at Uttarakhand’s popular tourist spots||NAINITAL/ MUSSOORIE: The rising number of Covid-19 cases and curbs have affected the hospitality business for the second time in a row during the peak summer tourist season. Bookings at Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR), which were hit this time last year due to the country-wide lockdown, have again reduced to half this year. On Sunday, over 100 people visited the reserve while 51 opted for a night stay. The hoteliers in the Corbett area said that their advance bookings have fallen by over 90 per cent. “The hotels here are on the verge of bankruptcy. There is not a single hotel near Corbett which can claim that even a tenth of its rooms are booked. It is becoming increasingly difficult for us to survive,” said Hari Mann, Ramnagar’s hotels’ association president. “Usually, at this time of the year, hotels here have 70 to 90 per cent bookings. Only last year was an exception,” Mann added. Corbett officials meanwhile said that although the night bookings had fallen by 50%, the day safaris have been affected even more. “Till April 4, we had a decent tourist footfall, but since then, the tourist numbers have been going down. We are trying to assess the actual numbers and the impact of Covid restrictions will be known only then,” said Corbett director, Rahul (who uses only his first name). Resorts which double as wedding venues are also bearing the brunt. One of the hoteliers whose resort is located on the periphery of CTR said that all the weddings scheduled for April and May have been cancelled. “The only booking that I still have is for November. We had almost a dozen bookings for April and May, and now, all of them have been cancelled,” he said. The Corbett administration is now planning to make RT-PCR- negative certificates mandatory for entry into the reserve. “With the rise in the number of Covid-19 cases, we are worried about its spread in Corbett. Therefore, we have had discussions with the stakeholders and Covid certificates will soon be made mandatory for tourists,” Rahul said. Mann said the move will make things worse for the resorts. “We all depend on Corbett for our living. The mandatory Covid-negative certificate requirement will further stop tourists from coming to Ramnagar, and ultimately, lead to many job losses in the area,” he added. Meanwhile in Mussoorie, three weeks after Uttarakhand issued an advisory asking tourists from 12 high-load states (including Delhi, UP, Maharashtra) to carry RT-PCR negative test reports, the drastic fall in business has forced several restaurants, cafes and hotels in the town to shut down. Sources say others are on the verge of downing shutters indefinitely. Satish Dhoundiyal, owner of Green restaurant in Mussoorie, said, “Tourist footfall has been negligible since April 1, resulting in heavy losses for us. With the rising Covid-19 cases in the state, the safety of our staff has also become a concern. We have closed our restaurant and will open once the situation improves and tourists start coming again.” Naresh Vachani, owner of Chic Chocolate Café on the Mall Road, too, closed his establishment on Friday. “The lack of tourist footfall, which resulted in heavy losses, coupled with the rising threat of the coronavirus were the reasons we decided to shut down. We will now wait for normalcy to return,” he said. According to the local traders’ association, there are a total of 50 large restaurants and cafés on the Mall road, out of which around five have already shut down and many more are planning to follow suit. Estimates suggest restaurants and café operators have been suffering losses ranging between Rs 20,000 and Rs 40,000 per day. “The food industry is labour-intensive and their inventory is perishable, which is why they have been hit the worst,” said Rajat Aggarwal, president of Mussoorie Traders’ Association. Hotels have also started to shut down. According to Sandeep Sahni, president of Uttarakhand Hotel Association, of around 250 hotels in Mussoorie, six hotels have temporarily closed down and at least 25 to 30 per cent more are going to close down by next week. “Such a situation at the peak tourist season is worrying, especially as we had pinned our hopes on this season to recover from last year’s losses,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rising-covid-cases-spell-doom-for-tourism-industry-at-uttarakhands-popular-tourist-spots/articleshow/82132781.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Pune||Cremation of Covid-19 deceased at all PMC facilities||Pune: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has allowed cremation of the Covid-19 patients in all its crematoriums with immediate effect. Earlier, the cremation was carried out only at the Kailash crematorium. One of the two electrical cremation facilities at the Kailash crematorium has stopped functioning due to the overload. The decision was taken because of the increase in deaths. The PMC has 21 cremation facilities. Every day, 150 dead bodies are cremated. Of these, 60 to 70 nCoV bodies are cremated in the PMC limits. According to civic officials, the cremation of Covid-19 patients has gone up nearly 8 to 10 times in the last fortnight or so. “Since the number of expired patients is high, relatives of the deceased patients wait for hours together at the Kailash crematorium. Some keep the dead bodies at the morgue. It is anguish for the relatives and is causing complications in the process of cremation,” a senior PMC official said. “The decision will reduce the hassles for the relatives of the deceased patients,” Shrinivas Kandul, a senior PMC official, said. The civic administration said the cremation of the nCoV patients is done following all the Covid-19 protocol. The relatives and hospital staff call the helpline. The details of the deceased are shared online. The civic body sends an ambulance and completes the other formalities. A civic team carries out the cremation. Only 20 people are allowed to be present at the cremation site.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cremation-of-covid-19-deceased-at-all-pmc-facilities/articleshow/82134447.cms||---
---||Goa||Over 40ha barren land turned green again||Ponda/Poinguinim: Over the years, increasing tracts of farmland in the state were either going uncultivated or being allowed to be taken over by non-agricultural activities. However, parts of Dharbandora and Canacona talukas are witnessing a reverse trend with over 40ha of fallow land being brought back under cultivation. During the last season, while such agricultural land patches in Dharbandora have been brought under paddy cultivation, a community farming initiative in Polem, Canacona, has seen youth tilling the land to grow the local bean variety ‘alsando’. Significantly, in both talukas, it has been a youth-driven initiative. In Vakekuyan in Shigao, Dharbandora, around 70 farmers have turned 30ha of fallow land green again. The land belonging to Eknath Khedekar’s family was lying untilled over the last three decades, since his father’s demise. Last season, Khedekar successfully produced a good yield of the local rice variety. “In the coming monsoon, I will try growing basmati rice. There is no mill in Goa to process the basmati variety, so I will get it processed in Karnataka,” Khedekar said. At Polem, about 20,000sqm of land lying fallow for almost twenty years has now similarly been turned green by a group of 11 locals. Locals earlier cultivated paddy on the land, but the practice was abandoned over the years. Youths from Polem said they had been left without employment during the pandemic and therefore decided that growing the commercial crop ‘alsando’ would fetch them a good price in the market. And they weren’t wrong. “Instead of idling away our time, we got together to use this barren land. We met the zonal agriculture officer Kirtiraj Naik Gaonkar, who guided us on this crop, which has good demand in the market,” said Sandesh Satarkar. Gaonkar said the ‘alsando’ is set to fetch the youth a price of Rs 160 to Rs 180 per kilo. A good monsoon during 2020 aided their efforts, said Jatan Pagi. “Since ‘alsando’ grows well in residual moisture, we identified this patch of fields located in a low lying area,” said Shripad Sawant. Naik Gaonkar said the ‘alsando’ crop is also known to turn soil fertile and will aid future crops in this patch of land now. It has been seen in recent years that farmers and landowners have been reluctant to practice farming as it is labour-intensive and the costs of labour are high. There is also a manpower shortage for such work in Goa. Beating these odds, in Dharbandora taluka, at least 44ha of land, which was lying fallow, has now been brought under cultivation, as per records of the agriculture department. Around 16ha that was under sugarcane cultivation is now under paddy cultivation following the Sanjivani sugar factory shutting down, Dharbandora zonal agriculture officer (ZAO) Nagesh Komarpant said. Farmers in these areas had also been facing disturbances from wild animals and the agriculture department has provided them with around 2.1km-long solar fencing at 90% subsidy to curb the wild animal menace. In Vagon, around 10ha lying fallow for 12-odd years has now been once again turned into farmland, Komarpant said. Farmer Namdev Mardolkar said they had let the farm go barren as their crop was getting ruined due to a breach in the Dholbag canal, from where they get water. “Now, the state has repaired it, so we have resumed farming,” Mardolkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/over-40ha-barren-land-turned-green-again/articleshow/82134462.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Makkar elected as Punjab Dyers’ Association chairman||Ludhiana: Putting an end to the ongoing controversy in the Punjab Dyers’ Association (PDA) over an alleged proposal by some stakeholders of the under construction common effluent treatment plant (CETP) at Tajpur to remove Ashok Makkar, a director in the board of directors of CETP, stakeholders in a meeting held on Saturday elected Makkar as chairman of the body. The need for meeting arose after rumours of a letter being written by some members against Makkar and asking for his removal spread but during the meeting, members who were earlier alleged to have issued letter for Makkar’s removal, claimed that they were in favour of him and unanimously brought a proposal to elect him as chairman. Meanwhile, in the meeting that was held at a city hotel, other faction of the PDA led by president Bobby Jindal too was present and efforts were made bMy the members to end other matters of conflict among the warring groups but it was decided to sort them out in another meeting that will be held after two weeks. Speaking to TOI, Ashok Makkar said, “During the discussions it also emerged that the letter written against me was forged — signatures of about 20 members from 28 who were being claimed to have written this letter were found to be fake. Based upon this all the directors and shareholders of the CETP have deposed their full faith in me and along with being given clean chit I was also given the important responsibility of chairman.” Makkar also added, “This is sad that on one side we are working day and night for the betterment of the industry and materialise our dream of setting up this CETP which will prove to be a gamechanger for the industry and also for the city, but on the other hand some are only creating roadblocks in the smooth functioning of the board of directors.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/makkar-elected-as-punjab-dyers-association-chairman/articleshow/82134446.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Pandemic-hit ‘qaidi mulaqat’ goes online again||MUMBAI: The one thing prisoners anxiously wait for is the next meeting with their relatives and lawyers. But though mulaqat (physical meeting) has once again been prohibited in state prisons to check the spread of Covid, smart phones have come to the rescue of 31,000 state prisoners. Prison authorities have again started organising virtual meetings between inmates and their relatives/lawyers through mobile video calling and video conferencing. Video calling facility, available to both undertrials and convicts, has begun in over 50 state prisons. While an undertrial can communicate to his/her relatives for 10 to 20 minutes once a week, a convict can avail this facility only once a fortnight. “For a lawyer-inmate mulaqat the time is unlimited,” said Sunil Ramanand, additional director general of polie, Prisons. After the outbreak of Covid last year, the state had released more than 10,000 prisoners from various jails to decongest the overcrowded prisons. Their numbers had decreased from 36,000 to 27,000 (following emergency parole, recommendations of high-power committee and regular bail). However, in the last couple of months, the number of prisoners in jails have again gone up to 31,000. Till now, jails have recorded 3,116 Covid positive cases among inmates and 717 among jail personnel. Most have recovered. Since the start of lockdown, the ‘wakeel-qaidi’ mulaqat was stopped in all jails. While hearing a PIL in July last year, the Bombay high court had directed the prison department to install smartphones in all jails and arrange lawyer-prisoner meeting through video calling. But with the pandemic seemingly in control towards the end of last year, physical meeting of inmates and relatives had resumed. However, with the surge in Covid cases, the physical meeting has again been stopped and entry of all visitors in jail premises has been prohibited. The video calling facility is also time-saving and cost-effective. It is, in fact, saving manpower too. To escort an inmate from jail to court, three to four police personnel have to be deployed with a police van.  Advocate Mubin Solkar, a criminal lawyer, welcomed the move. “I didn’t know about this facility till sometime ago when I got a video call from a murder convict in a state prison. He wanted to know the status of his appeal in the high court. Such (online) meetings are a welcome move. While it will help inmates get updates on their case, it is also a matter of convenience for both the inmates and lawyers,” said Solkar. He said that it will especially be helpful for convicts who are not taken to court after conviction. “By these facilities, even the convicts will know the status of their cases/appeal in the higher courts. The lawyer and inmates, while talking face to face through video calling, can share important facts relating to the case. The clients can give their inputs and the advocates can give timely advice to their clients. It’s a win win for both. The state government must be appreciated for this move as many undertrials are languishing in jails for years without proper communication with their advocates,” said Solkar. A source from the jail department said they have created dedicated email IDs for each prison. A lawyer can also visit the website — www.mahaprisons.gov.in — and send e-mail to the concerned jail authorities. The email can mention an inmate’s name, cell or barrack number, court case number etc. Once the jail authorities fix the e-meeting, a time is allotted to the lawyer to communicate with his client. Besides this, the prisoners can also make phone calls from 60-coin boxes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-pandemic-hit-qaidi-mulaqat-goes-online-again/articleshow/82135314.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Chandigarh||BJP leader chased into street in Haryana, video goes viral||Ismailabad (Kurukshetra): Saturday’s local video of farmers’ chasing BJP’s Jai Singh Pal into a street and manhandling him became Sunday’s social-media sensation. Appointed Haryana de-notified tribes’ development board vice-chairman last week, Pal was in town for a congratulatory event that the BJP had to cancel. It was small welcome event organised at a local shop but the farmers got wind of it despite the rescheduling and cordoned the venue. Some people tried to smuggle Pal out to his car but the farmers confronted them with anti-government slogans. Pal abandoned his car and ran into a lane, where farmers chased him down while raising pro-BKU slogans. The video shows young members of the farmer union running behind Pal into the street and catching hold of him, after which they tell him to follow them. Ismailabad SHO Vikrant said: "We got the report late but our teams reached the spot in front of the Patanjali store of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) worker Vinod Sharma. When we got there, there were 15-odd people around the shop and we asked them to leave. Till Sunday afternoon, we had no complaint about the attack." The community of Jai Singh Pal assembled at Pal Dharamshala in Kurukshetra on Sunday and met local MP Nayab Singh Saini before it took a written complaint to Ismailabad police. Kurukshetra district BJP president Raj Kumar Saini said: "It was a pre-planned attack. The people who sabotaged an event to honour a Backward Class leader cannot be farmers. They could be Congressmen and communists." Saini said: "Jai Singh Pal is a poor, humble man. An attack on him is an attack on the entire BC community. The Congress is an old enemy of the SC/BC communities."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bjp-leader-chased-into-street-in-haryana-video-goes-viral/articleshow/82136040.cms||JK Singh

According to the private hospitals’ association, beds earmarked for the critical patients are almost all taken. As per the reports of the NMC’s central bed reservation system (CBRS), all the 910 beds in the two civic-run Covid hospitals (Bytco and Zakir Hussain), including 421 beds for critical patients, are occupied. In the past week, NMC has increased the number of beds from 5,232 to 6,226. Raj Nagarkar, president of the Nashik private hospital owners’ association, said almost all the beds in over 140 private Covid hospitals too are occupied. “Private hospitals are also facing a scarcity of staff. Around 15% of the total staff in all the private hospitals have contracted Covid-19. We are making do with the staff available,” said Nagarkar. “There is a 50% shortage of health staff in private covid hospitals. The present staff is under tremendous pressure,” he added. Traders appeal for janata curfew from Monday All traders and social organisations in the city have appealed to the traders to observe a janata curfew for the next 10 days. Many traders, during the meeting called by the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture, agreed to participate in the curfew. Hemanth Rathi, president of Nashik Citizens’ Forum also appealed to the traders and residents to observe the curbs. He has appealed to the milk and fruit vendors to keep their shops open between 7 am and 10 am, and grocery shops between 8 am and 1 pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-1000-new-covid-beds-fail-to-meet-demand/articleshow/82132338.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Pune||Dearth of meds delays switch to nCoV hosps||Pune: Private medical practitioners and non-Covid hospitals are coming forward to bring in more beds under Covid-care in the city considering the severe crunch of hospital beds. However, apprehension over getting regular supply of essential medicines, like remdesivir, tocilizumab, and liquid medical oxygen, is holding the hospitals back from converting into Covid-19 hospitals or health centers. “The collaboration between private doctors and non-Covid hospitals can swiftly bring in additional 500 beds under Covid care,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India. Shortfalls in medical resources, however, are holding them back. “Doctors and hospitals willing to convert are currently on wait-and-watch mode as quite a few existing small and medium-sized hospitals treating Covid patients are grappling with shortage of all sorts of drugs, including liquid medical oxygen and trained human resources,” Patil said. “If the administration and government provide support with essential medical resources, the city can swiftly have a sizable number of oxygen beds,” he said. Currently, 9,000 beds are reserved under Covid-care at private and public hospitals in areas under Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). The surge in Covid patients needing hospitalization has overwhelmed the city’s medical infrastructure and skilled human resource is falling short to tackle rising admissions especially at small and medium-sized hospitals in Pune. Some hospitals are even asking patients’ Covid-recovered relatives to chip in. “Private medical practitioners, running clinics across the city, have started coming forward to support small hospitals treating Covid patients. At the IMA Pune branch, we are currently creating a pool of such willing doctors and helping hospitals in a structured way,” said BL Deshmukh, president of the city chapter of IMA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dearth-of-meds-delays-switch-to-ncov-hosps/articleshow/82134485.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Those who could not, were planning to do so on Monday in view of the state-wide lockdown that has now been imposed in Uttarakhand on Sundays. Mahant Hari Giri, patron of Juna Akhada told TOI that almost 80% of seers from his akhada had already left Kumbh and only a few seers will take a symbolic dip on the last shahi snan on April 27. “We do not want to risk the lives of the seers and pilgrims coming to Haridwar at a time when Covid cases are rising phenomenally. Therefore, a collective decision was made regarding closure of the Kumbh by our akhada,” he said. Juna Akhada — the largest of the 13 sects of seers in the country — had pulled out of the religious festival after convening a meeting of its core committee on Saturday. Most of the camps bear a deserted look as seers of prominent sanyasi akhadas like Juna, Atal, Agni, Ahavan, Niranja… https://t.co/6yzAqs5Q9r— TOI Cities (@TOICitiesNews) 1618799028000Meanwhile, seers of the Bairagi and Udasin sects reiterated that they will continue to stay on in the Kumbh mela and will participate in the last shahi snan. According to estimates, around half of the seers and most of the devotees from the Bada and Naya Udasin akhadas had left the Kumbh mela area. While the Bairagi seers were camping on, presence of devotees in their camps — where religious discourses and skits are being organised ahead of Ramnavami — was extremely low. Presence of devotees at the evening Ganga aarti at the Har-ki-Pauri ghat, which draws lakhs of pilgrims, was also minimal on Sunday. “Even though some seers are saying that they will stay for the last shahi snan, most of the camps are almost empty. The Kumbh is more or less over and we estimate that the devotee numbers will further decline in the next few days,” said an official from the mela administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kumbh-camps-wear-deserted-look-as-seers-pilgrims-leave/articleshow/82132814.cms||---
---||Nagpur||‘Break the chain’ of fake forwards, hoax messages on O2, remdesivir, beds||Nagpur: A certain medical representative “Nok**h is happy to help you with injection Remdesivir”, beds are available right now at these XXXX hospitals, list of oxygen suppliers, and RTPCR home collection contacts. Social media groups are flooded with messages and posts like these as soon a member calls out for help in getting a bed in a Covid hospital, medical oxygen, RTPCR tests or medicines. The social media hoaxes are not limited to just citizens falling prey to these messages, and wasting their time and resources besides deriving a false sense of hope. Doctors too are receiving calls from enterprising touts promising some additional money for admissions. Names of political leaders and ministers too are being dropped on such messages. “Among the hundreds of calls I am daily receiving, there are at least a dozen who say they will make the patient pay more than what our hospital charges,” said a hospital director. Psychiatrist Dr Suleman Virani said there are a couple of reasons behind this trend. “First is opportunity. Some people look at it as a good chance to make money. But some are genuine helpers and try their best, but fail as they are not in a powerful position,” he said. Cyber law expert Mahendra Limaye said pharmaceutical companies whose names are being used, local administration and the police must take action. “They are fully empowered under the Disaster Management Act,” he said. Limaye said before forwarding or believing in a social media post, people must try to verify the claims. “Panic is such that nobody is verifying. Have we ever seen marketing of pharmaceutical products like this? There are already curbs on online sale by pharma firms,” he said. Limaye cautioned that forwarding documents like Aadhaar card, address proof, personal details have risk of fraud in the long run. Dr Virani too agreed that it is important for public to verify from an official source before forwarding any message. “But it is impulsive behaviour, where the person takes the decision within fraction of a second thinking he is doing good. He realizes he did wrong but then it is too late,” he said. Dr Virani said developing a basic habit of waiting for a day can help break the chain of fake messages. “Some people act out of concern. But such persons must think that they are not alone and there are many helping out the affected person,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/break-the-chain-of-fake-forwards-hoax-messages-on-o2-remdesivir-beds/articleshow/82134464.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The Covid tests at the biggest testing facility in the state capital have been suspended for 48 hours as the lab is now shut for sanitisation. Contact tracing of the lab staff has begun, GDMC principal Dr Ashutosh Sayana told TOI. “We have around 25 staffers at the Covid lab. They work in three shifts round the clock. We will get everyone tested as per the protocol,” Dr Sayana said. “People should not get discouraged before vaccination when they hear about an already inoculated individual testing positive again. Those tested positive after vaccination get mild symptoms. The fatality rate also reduces after vaccination. So, we all should get vaccinated,” he added. In wake of the latest Covid surge, director general (DG) of health Dr Tripti Bahuguna reviewed the situation at the government hospital on Sunday. Since almost all the beds at Doon Hospital are full, the DG has ordered the immediate setting up of a 75-bed facility for Covid patients at the Coronation Hospital.“These 75 beds will be reserved at Coronation Hospital’s recently inaugurated wing. This new wing already has an oxygen pipeline,” Dr Bahuguna said. The DG added that patients in home isolation should follow the medical prescription issued by the health department and “hoarding of medicines must stop.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/5-staffers-of-doon-hospitals-covid-lab-test-ve-lab-shut-for-48-hours/articleshow/82132852.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Goa||All I needed was trust from the coach: Dheeraj||Margao: FC Goa goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh had a simple request to everyone: Please don’t create any hype (around me). “I am young and there are lot of areas I still have to improve," he reasoned during a pre-match media interaction on Monday. Since the AFC Champions League kicked off last week, Goa have made heads turn with some impressive defensive displays. They have maintained two clean sheets and remain the only team in group E not to concede a goal. At the heart of these defensive displays is goalkeeper Dheeraj. He was good in the opener against Al Rayyan and did even better in the next clash against Al Wahda, prompting coach Juan Ferrando to call him a ‘superman’. The Spanish coach got to see Dheeraj just four months ago when he made the move from ATK Mohun Bagan to Goa. Prior to his January transfer, the young goalkeeper played just one game in 18 months for the Kolkata giants. Yet, he got the nod to start in goal, ahead of Mohammed Nawaz and Naveen Kumar. Dheeraj didn’t enjoy the best of starts at Goa. He was suspect with set-pieces, gave away balls easily, conceded soft goals, and while all this happened, Ferrando continued to show faith. “He’s just 20. He will learn and improve,” the coach told whoever questioned him. Soon, Dheeraj grew in confidence and has now started to deliver on the promise that made him a star at the Fifa U-17 World Cup 2017 at home. “The World Cup was a big thing for me. It gave a lot of confidence. However, for the last season and a half, I only played one game at ATK Mohun Bagan. For a goalkeeper and a young player, you need matches to improve. Luckily, I was able to move to Goa. “All I needed was trust from the coach. He kept on supporting me to perform. I have no pressure coming from the coach. He asks me to play my natural game and that was very important for me to get my confidence back," said Dheeraj. At the AFC Champions League, Dheeraj grabbed plenty of attention. He made it to the best XI of ACL matchday one by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). Given his showing against Al Wahda in the next game, nobody was surprised when he made it to the best XI on matchday two as well. Dheeraj, though, admits his performance wasn’t flawless. “If you look closely at the last game, I made a few errors in the game, but always had my teammates to back me up. We play as a team and if anyone makes a mistake, we are there to support him,” he said. Goa will need Dheeraj at his best against group favourites Persepolis FC on Tuesday. The Iranian champions and last year’s ACL finalists are in terrific form, winning both their group games. Against Laurent Blanc’s Al Rayyan, they were down by a first-half goal, but turned the tide in their favour with three goals in nine minutes after the change of ends. “I am sure there will be some opportunities to score but it won’t be easy,” said Persepolis coach Yahya Golmohammadi. “We should grab our chances. The goalkeeper of Goa is a real star, one of the best player of Goa.” Looks like Golmohammadi didn’t hear what Dheeraj had to say. No hype, please.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/all-i-needed-was-trust-from-the-coach-dheeraj/articleshow/82151051.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Delhi||Delhi: Within hours, Covid ward of Hindu Rao Hospital sees 43 beds filled||NEW DELHI: Hindu Rao Hospital started admitting Covid-19 patients on Sunday, and by the evening, 43 beds have been occupied, according to the Delhi government application. The hospital, which is run by North Delhi Municipal Corporation, has dedicated 210 beds for Covid patients, including 10 for ICU/CCU. As per an order issued by Delhi government on Friday, the hospital, which has around 900 beds, will make arrangements for extending the facility by 350 beds from April 25. “The moment people of nearby areas got to know about the launch of the Covid ward at the hospital, there was a sudden increase in the footfall. However, the hospital administration checked the condition of patients, including their oxygen levels, before admitting them,” said mayor Jai Prakash, who visited the hospital and spoke to the medical staff. “I assured them all support and discussed the strategy for ensuring smooth treatment of patients.” The centre has been opened in the emergency building like last year and has separate entry and exit points. “People coming for other treatment and OPDs don’t need to be afraid of the infection. We are also arranging for regular sanitisation of the whole premises.” said Jai Prakash. The testing and vaccination centres will also continue at Hindu Rao. An isolation ward at Balak Ram Hospital is also ready and will start as soon as the corporation gets permissions, he added. In south Delhi, the civic body has got the permission to start a Covid ward at its Tilak Nagar Multispecialty Hospital from Monday. “We have placed everything in order and the district administration has given permission to start the 60-bed facility from Monday. Here we will provide basic treatment to Covid patients, including oxygen supply, but no ICU facility,” said an official of South Delhi Municipal Hospital. If a patient’s condition becomes serious, he will be referred to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, its link hospital. The Tilak Nagar hospital will increase the number of beds to 100 in the next two days. The Covid facility at Kalkaji Hospital is expected to start from next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/within-hours-covid-ward-of-hindu-rao-sees-43-beds-filled/articleshow/82134486.cms||Vibha Sharma

The monthly total of positive cases is also set to cross a lakh in just 19 days of April, on Monday. Of 85 deceased, 45 were residents of the city. Six each deceased were from Hanuman Nagar Zone, Nehru Nagar Zone, Lakadganj Zone and Mangalwari zone. Four zones, Dharampeth, Dhantoli, Gandhibagh and Satranjipura recorded four deaths each. Three deceased were from Laxmi Nagar zone and two from Ashi Nagar zone. Of remaining 40 deaths, 33 deceased were residents of rural parts of the district and seven from other districts who tested positive and succumbed during treatment in hospitals in the district. A major worry for the district is that the deaths are seeing a new high every day for the last four days. Before beginning of second wave, the highest number of deaths on a day were 64 on September 17 last year. Excluding four days, all days in April have registered 60 or more deaths. Highest deaths in a day were 73 on April 8, then 74 fatalities were recorded on April 15, followed by 75 on April 16, 79 on April 17, and 85 on April 18. Total toll in 18 days of April has been 1,175, which is more than the monthly fatalities in the entire pandemic excluding September last year, which recorded 1,465 deaths. Cumulative deaths stand at 6,273 as on Sunday. The district is fourth among 35 in the state in the matter of fatalities, after Mumbai, Pune and Thane. Case fatality rate (CFR) in April is lower compared to August to October 2020, due to high number of cases in the current month. CFR in April is 1.21% (1,175 deaths against 97,068 cases). CFR was 3.80% in August followed by 3.02% in September and 3.55% in October last year. The district had witnessed peak of first wave from third week of August to end of September. The district recorded 7,107 positive cases on Sunday, which was the second-highest total in a day, the highest being 7,201 on April 11. The district has registered 97,068 cases in 18 days of April, which is much more than those registered in all months in the pandemic. The number is double those registered in September last year (48,457), which was highest among all months till March. Active cases surged to 69,243 on Sunday, again the highest-ever figure for a day, worsening crisis of beds. Meanwhile, Kingsway Hospital in association with Centre Point Hotels and Resorts started admission of mild and moderate patients in Covid Care Centre (CCC) developed at Centre Point Hotel at Ramdaspeth on Sunday, where 10 patients were admitted and number will be increased to 150 in phased manner. Also, corporator Vijay Zalke along with Dr Manish Patil opened 20-bedded CCC at Ramleela Lawn on Narsala Road at Dighori on Sunday. Suyog Hospital in association with Adi Hotel on Sunday also announced start of a 65-bedded CCC in the hotel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/85-covid-patients-die-in-dist-on-sunday-highest-in-a-day/articleshow/82134483.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Chandigarh||‘Need thorough study to help Punjab out of financial mess’||Chandigarh: Former deputy speaker of Punjab Vidhan Sabha and SAD (Democratic) leader Bir Devinder Singh said that there was the need for a thorough debate to help Punjab emerge from the “current fiscal mess and administrative decay.” “The taxonomy of DBT (direct benefit transfer), MSP (minimum support price), and purpose and performance of RDF (rural development fund) needs to be dissected thoroughly with clinical precision to identify the rot,” he said. The former deputy speaker said it was unfortunate that the culture of micro-audits and accountability had almost vanished from the system of governance in Punjab. “Eventually, the nexus of corrupt Punjab politicians and bureaucrats of the same hue began overlooking the inflexible fiscal discipline in utter disregard of their sworn responsibility towards the financial health of the state,” he said in a press statement. He was of the view that the decay started increasing progressively when the strength of the ‘steel frame’ of the Indian Administrative Services began crumbling due to non-adherence of administrative ethics and moral values. “Things became horribly nastiest when the Punjab government led by Parkash Singh Badal pledged the entire annual receipt of RDF amounting to Rs 4,200 crore approximately for five years to the Punjab National Bank and drew a whopping loan of Rs 20,000 crore against the RDF,” said Bir Devinder. He claimed that the pledged RDF practically became a non-performing asset (NPA) for Punjab and unrestricted usage of Rs 20,000 crore drawn against the RDF was used very liberally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/need-thorough-study-to-help-punjab-out-of-financial-mess/articleshow/82136045.cms||---
---||Pune||Remdesivir, tocilizumab shortages continue in Pune||PUNE: Relatives of Covid-19 patients and small city hospitals continued to report shortages of key drugs remdesivir and tocilizumab on Sunday. Remdesivir is primarily meant for moderately ill patients; tocilizumab is given to those who are severely ill. Both are repurposed drugs (originally designed to fight other diseases) and are not targeted therapies against Covid. Their use, however, has been beneficial in carefully selected Covid-19 patients. "Pune district did not receive a single vial of remdesivir on Sunday (April 18). But we expect to get 4,300 vials on Monday (April 19). The supply will ease the shortage in the district to some extent," said Shyam Pratapwar, assistant commissioner (drug), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pune branch. Critical care expert Prasad Rajhans said, "Remdesivir is not the panacea against Covid. It works only in carefully selected patients. We have other supportive drugs, including steroids and blood thinners, that have led to excellent recovery rates." As for tocilizumab, a section of doctors in the city has started giving the drug subcutaneously to Covid patients with pneumonia. Subcutaneous administration of the injection requires a lower dose compared to the standard practice of giving it intravenously (IV). "The supply of tocilizumab has always been erratic. So we have been using the drug subcutaneously in select patients. Like remdesivir, it is also not a targeted therapy against Covid-19. It has proven beneficial only to some Covid patients," said infectious disease expert Parikshit Prayag. The anti-rheumatic drug has been found effective in counteracting the cytokine storm, an abnormal immune response caused by SARS-COV-2. On tocilizumab's shortage, Pratapwar said, "Unlike remedesivir, which is produced by over seven pharma companies in India, tocilizumab is an imported drug. Cipla pharmaceuticals is the only Indian company that has an import license. It is a very costly drug and its supply has remained erratic for over a year now."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/remdesivir-tocilizumab-shortages-continue-in-city/articleshow/82134490.cms||Umesh Isalkar

After receiving a complaint against a South Delhi hospital that denied admission saying no bed was available despite the Delhi Covid app indicating 239 vacant beds, Delhi government ordered legal action against it. A similar action has been taken against another hospital in Janakpuri, which had claimed on the app that 93 beds were vacant but denied admission to patients claiming unavailability of beds. Recently, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had directed officials to take stern action against hospitals uploading wrong information about availability of beds. All hospitals in the capital have to declare information about the bed availability on the government’s Delhi Corona app, and also on the hospitals’ LED boards. Delhi government has appointed senior officials at these hospitals to look after these matters. Delhi government has also ordered FIRs against four airlines for carrying passengers from Maharashtra without valid RT-PCR tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-orders-firs-against-2-hosps-for-wrong-info-on-corona-app/articleshow/82134528.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nashik||Nandurbar boards Covid patients on train||Nashik: Nandurbar district administration has finally started using train coaches to isolate and treat Covid patients with mild symptoms after the Railways put in place a series of measures to ensure patients are not in distress due to the rising temperature. It is the first district in north Maharashtra to use train coaches to board and treat patients since the outbreak of the pandemic. The Railways had provided 20 coaches to the Nandurbar district administration last week. However, the district administration had not immediately started using the coaches as it feared that the rising daytime temperatures would cause severe inconvenience to the patients. Raghunath Bhoye, the district civil surgeon, told TOI: “We have now overcome this problem as the Railways has set up seven to eight big desert coolers in each coach. These big coolers are placed outside the coaches near widows facing the platform. The Railways has also put smaller coolers inside the coaches. Sacks have been placed on the roof of the train, which is watered frequently during the day to keep the coaches cool.” Bhoye said only male Covid patients will be admitted to these Covid care coaches. “The admissions process started on Saturday evening and so far, 15 patients are undergoing treatment here. There are six doctors and four male nurses appointed at the Covid care coaches. Once the number of patients increases, more healthcare workers will be deployed,” said Bhoye. Railway minister Piyush Goyal on Sunday tweeted, “Railways is devoting all its resources for fighting Covid-19. Isolation coaches have started functioning at Nandurbar, Maharashtra with Covid-19 patients are being admitted. (sic)” Nandurbar district collector Rajendra Bharud responded to Goyal’s tweet by thanking the Railways for making the Covid care rail coaches comfortable. The Covid care train is stationed at one of the platforms of the Nandurbar railway station and the entire area around that platform has been covered.

Three sustained severe burn injuries while four have minor burns. All seven burn victims have been shifted to a hospital in Sangli. The company deals with inflammable solvents. “The fire continued to rage for four hours before it was brought under control. Overheating in the solvent extraction reactor unit may have caused the blast,” said Khed sub-divisional officer Avish kumar Sonone. The high intensity blasts shook the area, said a fire brigade official. Dozens of workers were inside the plant when the incident took place. Five fire brigade vehicles and private water tankers were pressed into service to contain the blaze. “The fire started at 9 am and its actual cause is still unknown. Investigation is on,” said Khed police assistant inspector Sujit Gadade. “The deceased were identified as Mangesh Jankar (22), Vilas Kadam (36) and Sachin Talwar (28). The injured include Omkar Salvi (23), Vishwas Shinde (62), Vilas Kharavate (42), Parvez Alam Shaikh (26), Ramchandra Bahutule (55), Jitendra Akhade (23) and Anant Jankar (27).

---||Nashik||During lockdown, vax drive will be on hold: Collector||Nashik: District collector Suraj Mandhare has said that in case a total lockdown is imposed in Nashik district to contain the spread of Covid-19, all vaccination centres too would remain shut for the entire duration. In order to ensure a complete lockdown, if and when its is announced, the police would be manning the streets and people would not be allowed to step about. Citizens found moving about in the city will not be able to use “visit to a vaccination site” as an excuse. “The police personnel will ask people for their reason to be out of their homes. If the vaccination centres are kept open, people may use them as an excuse. It will them be difficult for the police to assess the genuineness in each case by checking for the vaccine SMSes,” Mandhare said. Such a practice would be impractical and would further bring the police personnel in the close contact with the persons. They might ven catch the infected. That is why it is advisable to keep the vaccination centres closed during a complete lockdown, the collector reasoned. Mandhare further stated that there were fewer vaccine doses available across the district and the vaccination drive had already slowed down. “It may also be noted that the vaccine stock is dwindling and not all centres are running in full strength anyway. Besides, vaccination and ‘Break the Chain’ are two different things. Therefore, it is likely that the vaccination centres would remain closed,” the collector added. “Rhere are currently 65,000 vaccine doses available with us. And only about 50 out of the 205 vaccination centres are conducting the process at this time,” he said On average, about 16,000 daily doses are being administered to the beneficiaries in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/during-lockdown-vax-drive-will-be-on-hold-collector/articleshow/82132354.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Chandigarh||Daily Covid cases touch 625 for first time in Chandigarh||CHANDIGARH: The city on Sunday recorded the highest single-day surge of 625 Covid-19 cases since the pandemic broke out in March last year, leading experts to predict such numbers for another few weeks, then a dip and a spike again. “This is like the Spanish flu where surges came on and off. We need to learn to live with this virus. And, this is possible with Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said a public health expert in PGI, even as the last 18 days logged 6,678 cases and 33 deaths. Three people died of the virus on Sunday — a 52-year-old man from Sector 24 having respiratory distress syndrome, a 62- year-old diabetic woman from Sector 29 and a 28-year-old woman from Mauli Jagran suffering from respiratory distress syndrome and kidney problem — pushing the toll to 413. According to estimates, 28,252 out of every 10 lakh people in Chandigarh have tested positive. The doubling rate, however, is over 100 days. “This is community transmission. All the non-exposed people will be at risk of infection. One needs to be careful and follow the norms strictly,” said the expert. The administration implemented weekend lockdown from April 17 after double mutant strain was reported in the city. “It will take a while to understand the effectiveness of this measure. However, there seems to be no scientific evidence behind night curfew,” said the expert. In the last one week, the number of new infections has grown by an average of 1.3% every day. The recovery rate is 90%. A total of 411 patients were discharged on Sunday, taking the recovery count to 29,896. Confirmed cases are 33,934, including 3,625 active cases. “Even while we are seeing younger patients, including children, in severe category, most are recovering after a week or so. Things might change as there is a lot of unpredictability about this virus,” said a faculty member in PGI. The testing has been ramped up, with over 3,000 samples tested in a day. Mohali: Record 880 infections Mohali reported a record 880 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, pushing the count to 36,073, including 6,211 active cases. Three patients died too, taking the toll to 502. A total of 370 cases were from Mohali urban, 194 from Kharar, 136 from Dhakoli, 57 from Derabassi, 55 from Gharuan, 32 from Boothgarh, 20 from Lalru, 11 from Kurali and five from Banur.

---||Kochi||Police team takes Sanu Mohan into custody from Karnataka||Kochi: More than three weeks after a 13-year-old girl was found dead in Muttar River in Kochi on March 23, her father Sanu Mohan (40) — who mysteriously disappeared on March 20 — was intercepted by the police in Karnataka on Sunday. Though city police were yet to formally confirm his arrest, a well-placed source within the force confirmed that he was nabbed by a team early on Sunday. According to sources, the caught person was undergoing interrogation and a news conference has been scheduled in Kochi by city police on Monday to unravel the mystery in this case. As per the ‘lookout notice’ issued by the police, he was being traced in case number: 234/2021, a man missing case registered at Thrikkakara police station. However, it is yet to be confirmed whether the police are going to charge him with any other offence. According to sources, after leaving the hotel in Mookambika where he was staying, Mohan kept travelling by bus and was apprehended when he was in Karwar, Karnataka. Source said that he had travelled in a bus towards Udupi and later got down near a forest area. He took another bus and travelled in the opposite direction towards Karwar where he was apprehended by state police with the help of Karnataka police. His disappearance became suspicious due to the mysterious death of his daughter Vaiga. According to the police, they suspect that the child was in a semi-conscious state when she came in contact with the water, increasing the possibility of her death becoming a murder. Also, police now believe that there was no third party involved in the whole incident, making the disappearance of the father more suspicious. The breakthrough in the case came on Friday when Mohan was spotted at Mookambika. With this, police were finally able to confirm that he was alive and decrease the search radius. City police had also recovered CCTV footage of his presence at a hotel and from other areas in the temple town. The missing person had stayed at the hotel for nearly a week and was supposed to check out on Friday. He had promised to pay via card but managed to flee without paying, making the hotel staff suspicious. This led to the crucial alert about his presence to the police. Police had deployed over five teams in cities near Mookambika to track him down. Entry and exit points, including railway stations and airports, were alerted to prevent his escape. Mohan was based in Pune before settling down at Thrikkakara five-and-half years ago. He reportedly came to Kerala without the knowledge of his relatives. It is suspected that he used the flat in Thrikkakara as a hideout due to his financial crises. Mohan was last seen when he left with his daughter in his car from their flat at Thrikkakara on the night of March 20. The child’s body was found in Muttar on March 23. The mystery behind her death of the girl had strengthened when police found CCTV visuals of Mohan crossing the Walayar checkpost in the early hours of March 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/police-team-takes-sanu-mohan-into-custody-from-karnataka/articleshow/82133678.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Rs 8-lakh fake currency seized, 1 held||New Delhi: Delhi Police’s Special Cell has seized fake currency with a face value of Rs 8 lakh from a smuggler at Anand Vihar. Due to the pandemic, the Malda-based cartel was trying to pump in fake notes in the denominations of Rs 2,000 and Rs 500. The consignment originated in Pakistan and was being routed through Bangladesh. The cartel collected it on the Indo-Bangladesh border and brought them to Delhi via train. According to deputy commissioner of police (Special Cell) Sanjeev Yadav, the smuggler has been identified as Abdul Rahim, a resident of Malda in West Bengal. He was arrested from near exit gate of Anand Vihar railway station following a tip-off. “He is a member of Malda-based fake Indian currency notes (FICN) syndicate and has been smuggling FICN from Bangladesh for a long time. For this purpose he has visited Bangladesh several times. Rahim was about to deliver the notes to one of his contacts based in Delhi when he was arrested,” Yadav said. In 2016, Rahim started a business of ladies suits and used to visit Bangladesh for to purchase these. He met a fake currency supplier there and joined the trade. The supplier bas been identified as Nasruddin. Rahim was initially being paid Rs 3,000 per trip. Nasruddin used to collect the FICN from smugglers/suppliers based near Indo-Bangladesh border, who smuggled the fake notes from Bangladesh through cross-border smugglers. Later, Rahim also started accompanying Nasruddin to collect the FICN from the suppliers. They both collected several consignments of FICN from there and further supplied to their associates based in different parts of India in the last three years. For the last few months, Abdul Rahim was getting Rs 1 lakh of FICN as his share on delivery of Rs 8 lakh or more.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rs-8-lakh-fake-currency-seized-1-held/articleshow/82134574.cms||---
---||Patna||Night curfew in Bihar; schools, colleges, religious places to remain shut till May 15||PATNA: Amid sustained daily increase in the number of Covid-19 positive cases in the the state, CM Nitish Kumar on Sunday announced night curfew from 9pm to 5am, besides authorizing the district and block headquarters to impose prohibitory orders under Section 144 of CrPC to restrict crowd movement in places and areas they deemed proper. He also announced the payment of one-month additional salary to the frontline doctors, health workers and others concerned. After a marathon meeting of the crisis management group with the DMs, the government also decided to keep schools, colleges, other educational institutions and religious places closed till May 15. There will be no examination during the period, except those conducted by recruitment commissions, the CM said. All parks, cinema halls, swimming pools and malls have been closed while all kinds of private and official public functions have been prohibited. Shops, fruit and vegetable mandis will close by 6pm, instead of 7pm. Dining in restaurants and dhabas has been banned but home delivery of edible items is allowed till 9pm, Nitish said. He said the number of persons attending the burial and funeral ceremonies has been pruned to 25, while only 100 persons will now be allowed to participate in the marriage and ‘shraddh' ceremonies. The CM said essential services like transport, banking, health and fire services have been spared. Similarly, e-commerce and activities at industrial centres will continue unencumbered. “The situation will be monitored daily for taking the necessary decisions further,” the CM said, adding that the state recorded 8,690 coronavirus cases on Sunday, which was the highest single-day count. “The decisions are based on the talks we held with leaders of political parties on Saturday as well as the information shared by the DMs of different districts during the over four-hour meeting we held through videoconferencing today,” he added. The DMs have been asked to create containment zones in areas which throw up corona positive cases. They have also been asked to stagger the vegetable markets to newer areas in the towns to prevent overcrowding of people. The government and non-government offices, which earlier used to close at 6pm, will now close at 5pm. The presence of the number of staff in offices will continue on the rotational basis. The CM said detailed discussions were held with regard to migrant workers, maintenance of the supply chains of medicines and oxygen, opening and monitoring of quarantine centres at the sub-divisional level and daily monitoring of the cases of those kept in home isolation. “If the migrant workers were willing to return to the state, they should do it early. It will help them and also the government in taking care of their needs, like creating work opportunities for them and keeping them in quarantine centres for the limited period after their testing, if the need arose,” he said. “On Sunday, talks were also held with the Centre with regard to the oxygen supply. The testing and treatment of infected persons is of utmost importance and, accordingly, even the private hospitals have been roped in down to the sub-divisional level. The doctors at AIIMS will also give them training on the testing and treatment of the corona cases,” Nitish said, adding that the report of the RTPCR tests will be provided in time. The CM also said the panchayati raj and urban development department will provide masks to the persons concerned and also asked people to maintain Covid appropriate behaviour and observe all the protocols required for the prevention of infection and transmission. Mass publicity drive through microphone will also be launched in the state to raise public awareness, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/night-curfew-in-state-schools-colleges-religious-places-to-remain-shut-till-may-15/articleshow/82133677.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: No trace of 20 Covid-positive patients 24 hours after they escaped government hospital in Tehri||DEHRADUN: Twenty-four hours after 20 Covid-19-positive patients who had visited the Kumbh mela fled Sridev Suman Government Hospital in Narendra Nagar, Tehri, none of them have been traced yet. Police meanwhile blamed the health department and the hospital for giving insufficient details. Tehri CMO Dr Suman Arya said that the patients took advantage of the chaos that ensued at the hospital after a Covid-19 patient died and escaped. According to Tehri district magistrate Iva Ashish Srivastava, the FIR filed by Narendra Nagar police on Sunday evening under sections of the Epidemic and Disaster Management Acts mentions that seven of the patients who fled were tourists from Rajasthan, one was from Uttarakhand, three were from Haryana, four from Odisha and five from Uttar Pradesh. However, the hospital had informed that all the escapees had come from Rajasthan. Narendra Nagar deputy SP Ravindra Kumar Chamoli told TOI, “The hospital informed police about the missing coronavirus-positive patients at 10:30 pm on Saturday. We rushed to the hospital, only to find there was no staff who could give any definite details. No one knew the exact number of patients that escaped or when. We had to wait till morning to get these crucial details, which is enough time for someone to cross the state’s borders.” At the time of the incident, the hospital, where 200 beds are allocated to Covid patients, had 38 Covid-positive patients, said chief medical officer (CMO) Tehri Dr Suman Arya. A senior health department official told TOI that the matter came to light when a caterer went to the hospital to distribute food packets and found half the packets had not been picked. This tipped off hospital staff, who then discovered that 20 patients were missing. As for how 20 patients managed to escape a hospital undetected, the CMO said that a Covid patient had died at the hospital and a large number of people had gathered outside. “The patients took advantage of the chaos. As it was a sad time for the family of the patient who died, we were not able to immediately ask them to leave the hospital premises.” The CMO added that the patients had earlier requested to be discharged, saying they hadn’t packed enough to stay for two more weeks in Uttarakhand. She added that the escape did not seem to be a spur-of-the-moment decision. “It had to be planned. It is impossible to travel from an area as remote as Tehri without assistance. There is hardly any conveyance available here. We believe they took the help of a local resident,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/no-trace-of-20-covid-positive-patients-24-hours-after-they-escaped-govt-hosp-in-tehri/articleshow/82132920.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Surat||In Gujarat, Covid tightening grip on children below 10 yrs||Surat/Vadodara/Ahmedabad: It’s been more than a year of trial now for the children who were first locked up inside homes during the lockdown and having to cope with online education in the first round of the Covid-19 induced pandemic, but situation turned a shade worse for them now. Of the 20,162 Covid-19 cases registered in Surat city, 296 are of children between the age group of 0 and 10 years. This shows that the new strain in the second wave has made the young children, particularly infants, highly vulnerable to the deadly contagion. What’s more, the rate of fatality is also much higher among them as well as the need for oxygen or ventilator support. In Surat alone, on average nine kids have been infected on a daily basis in the past one month. In Vadodara, around six kids test positive daily in the rapid test carried out at the outpatient department of the state-run SSG Hospital. The situation has been so alarming that private children’s hospitals in the city had to even create ICU beds for infants. “Initially we created three beds for infants, but within a week we had to expand the facilities as more infants with severity were brought in,” said Dr Mohit Sahni, state president of National Neonatology Forum. Vadodara has witnessed 661 Covid-19 cases in the age group of zero to 10 years, of which 580 have recovered. Yet, there are 81 active cases in this age group, as per Vadodara Municipal Corporation’s data. “We had 16 patients who were treated at our Covid facility for paediatric patients. Ten of them have recovered while six are undergoing treatment,” said Dr Sheila Aiyer, head of Department of Paediatrics at SSG Hospital, which was the first in the state to set up a dedicated emergency room for kids in March. She confirmed that around six children test positive daily at OPD of the department. “Children are coming with bad pneumonia. As infection amongst adults is on the rise, we are getting more patients with each passing day,” said Aiyer. Dr Rakesh Joshi, additional medical superintendent in Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad, said that the positivity among the toddlers has increased manifold during the current wave. “It could well be attributed to the nature of the viral spread. This time we see many children whose parents or family members are infected first getting transmitted with the virus. Same with the newly-born whose mothers have got infected,” he said. “In 40% of the cases, the toddlers are getting infected either from playing outside or being exposed to infection inddors. However, mortality has remained low compared to the general population,” Dr Joshi added. At Ahmedabad civil hospital, about 12 paediatric patients are under treatment. The number in the first three months of 2021 had been hovering around one or two only. Doctors have been observing that infants are showing more severity than older children. “Some serious cases of older cases have also been reported, but these are less than infants,” said Sahni. “We are surprised at the parameters of the infants,” he added. Doctors are also planning to get in touch with the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune to know more about the strain of the virus. Last week, three infants had died during treatment for Covid-19 at different hospitals. Sahni said that the cause of death is renal failure or heart failure. “A few kids have been discharged and we may discharge three more in a couple of days,” Sahni said. Secretary of Ahmedabad Academy of Paediatrics, Dr Manish Mehta said that diarrhoea has remained a very common symptom in recent times along with gastro-intestinal involvement. Dr Pushkar Shrivastava, an Ahmedabad-based paediatrician said that the number of adolescents is slightly higher owing to their movement as well as insensitivity to safety rules. “Along with the symptomatic patients, we should also keep in mind that several kids also have post-Covid complications, commonly known as multi-system inflammatory syndrome which can happen for up to two months of recovery,” Dr Shrivastava said, adding that the common symptoms include reddening of eyes, lips or tongue along with lack of energy.

---||Goa||Goa: Birds crashing into new-age buildings on the rise||PANAJI: In a hostile environment that new-age constructions create for avifauna, the trauma of surviving in a shrunken habitat is enhanced by new obstructive conditions. Birds crashing into glass-fronted houses and buildings is slowly on the rise, say birders. Use of glass, coated thinly with metallic oxide on one side, for walls and windows may be considered fashionable for modern constructions. It also mitigates global warming by keeping interiors cool through reduced power consumption. But many birders and nature lovers are saddened by increasing cases of avian fatalities. Goa is fast losing its green patches, which are possibly bird corridors. But the glare of reflective glass is adding a new dimension to the birds’ shrinking habitats. “On an average, we receive one or two cases of bird injuries every week within a 20-km radius of Ponda. Two days ago, a barbet crashed into a house window in Nagueshi,” an animal rescuer and state wildlife advisory board member Charan Desai said. Many bird fatalities arising from this unanticipated problem may be unreported. “The bird habitats are already impacted due to construction and other activity. Birders may realise about such cases only when they are on the spot or through complaints,” a veteran birder Mandar Bhagat said. But birders agree that such cases are growing and it is a worrisome problem. “We came across eight cases of injured oriental dwarf kingfishers. Only one found near North Goa district hospital building, in Mapusa, survived out of eight,” chief naturalist at a tourism firm Savio Fonseca said. In Goa, reflective glass use appears to be more of a style statement for new houses. “Birds fly straight into the glass because they see a reflection of trees or forest or may be at times, they don’t see anything,” an animal rescuer Benhail Antao said. The impact on hitting the glass is mostly fatal. “Spinal fracture is the most common injury when birds fly into glass doors or windows. The recovery is difficult, but we euthanise them only as a last option,” a veterinarian Dr Charmaine Pinto said. Birders suggest use of plain, non-reflective active glass to prevent injuries. As a mitigation measure, others suggest use of transparent stickers printed by graphic printers reflective glass to cut the glare. “The issue of mirror type/reflective windows can be resolved through use of stickers of raptors, colourful curtains or uttered windows,” Fonseca said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/birds-crashing-into-new-age-buildings-on-the-rise/articleshow/82134607.cms||Paul Fernandes

Asking the promoters to furnish the details in a stipulated format, MahaRERA invoked the enabling provisions of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, which has been in force since May 2017. The format asks for details such as total number of floors/wings, number of flats/shops/rowhouses, carpet area, sold/booked/unsold inventory and registration date with the sub-registrar’s office. “We welcome the latest MahaRERA order which seems to be aiming to weed out illegal constructions mostly seen in smaller towns,” CREDAI Maharashtra president Sunil Furde said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-disclose-sold-or-booked-inventory-says-maharera/articleshow/82135344.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Drug crisis adds to Kolkata’s Covid woes||KOLKATA: The crisis in hospital beds triggered by an unprecedented rise in Covid cases in the city has been further accentuated by a shortage of two key medicines used to treat serious patients. Remdesivir, a broad-spectrum antiviral medication, and Tocilizumab, an immunosupressive drug that is used to treat inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, are either in short supply or not available in market channels. The crisis in these two drugs prompted chief minister Mamata Banerjee to write to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday and seek the Centre’s assistance for emergency supply to treat critical patients admitted in hospitals. According to the letter, Bengal currently requires 6,000 vials of Remdesivir and 1,000 vials of Tocilizumab daily. While the state is able to procure around 1,000 vials of Remdesivir a day, there is no Tocilizumab vial available. However, these drugs are not to be taken without permission from doctors. Chandresh Sanghvi, a pharmaceutical dealer and member of the Bagree Market Medicine Association, believes Remdesivir stocks that are lying with various stockists or retailers will hit the market this week as the government has issued a notification reducing prices. “Since medicines cannot be sold at prices higher than MRP, the Remdesivir stock in the market will be cleared soon as it is priced higher than the batches of medicine that will arrive next,” he said. Pankaj Vora, another drug-seller in Bagree Market, said he had received multiple requests from clients for these two drugs but had been unable to supply them. “I don’t know when the supply will normalize,” he said. After the Remdesivir crisis first surfaced, pharmaceutical companies were asked by the Centre to deliver the drugs directly to hospitals and doctors according to their requirement. Sanghvi and other medicine wholesalers at Bagree Market and Mehta Building said that the crisis was an artificial one caused by panic purchase and hoarding by an affluent section of the population. Raju Khandelwal of Dhanwantary chain, which retails medicines, said demand for both Remdesivir and Tocilizumab was high but he was unable to supply them as they were being sent directly to hospitals. “If a doctor prescribes any of these medicines to a patient in home isolation, then it is a problem,” he said. An administrator of a city hospital said supply was inadequate and suggested helplines to acquire these two drugs. However, there have been reports of some hospitals allegedly telling patients’ families to source these drugs from agents at a premium. Gautam Jatia of Frank Ross, however, said its stores at AMRI Hospitals had adequate stock, but it was only meant for indoor patients. They were unable to sell it to outdoor patients, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/drug-crisis-adds-to-kols-cov-woes/articleshow/82133687.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Atwal said, “Mohali is placed fifth in the state for the number of RT-PCR tests. We have challaned 4,868 violators.” He said the administration has constituted fresh teams to keep checks in the markets for not wearing masks as well as not maintaining social distancing.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 40-bed Covid ICU at Mulund octroi naka likely in a week||MUMBAI: The BMC is setting up a 40-bed Covid ICU at the defunct octroi naka in Mulund. It will appoint doctors and nurses to run the centre. The facility is expected to start next week, officials said.  “We’ve begun work on the unit as there’s a shortage of ICU beds. We’ve already converted the Mithaghar School into a Covid hospital. The ICU at the octroi naka will be a high-dependency unit and all beds will have ventilators,” said Kishori Gandhi, assistant municipal commissioner of T ward. The BMC last month re-started its 275 bed Covid centre at Mithaghar School after two Covid hospitals in the Mulund Bhandup belt were shut down owing to incidents of fire to tackle the scramble for beds in the locality. Officials said after Covid-19 cases were reported in Mulund, a scramble for beds in private hospitals had begun in the area. The fire at Sunrise Hospital housed in Bhandup’s Dreams Mall was the second fire at a Covid-19 hospital in the Bhandup-Mulund belt in six months. Last October, two patients died while being shifted after a fire broke out at Mulund’s Apex Hospital due to a short circuit at the hospital. “We have over 3,500 active cases in Mulund and there is a desperate need for ICU beds since most patients are from buildings and are senior citizens. So we need ICU beds. It’s a welcome move that BMC is now making a 40-bed dedicated ICU unit at the octroi naka,” said BJP MLA from Mulund, Mihir Kotecha. Last June, BMC converted a school in Mulund into a full-fledged Covid-19 hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-40-bed-covid-icu-at-mulund-octroi-naka-likely-in-a-week/articleshow/82134606.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The concept of toddy board, that will have a direct impact on the lives of approximately 40,000 direct and thousands of ancillary labourers working in 5,800 toddy shops in the state, was notified on the eve of elections. The concept was being discussed for more than three years. However, the rules could not be framed as the model code of conduct was in force by then. According to the notification issued by the government, the duty of the board is to organize, develop and encourage toddy industry, ensure employment and perform functions as may be fixed by the government from time to time. The board should ensure the availability of natural toddy to consumers, collect and store toddy from places where there is large scale production and transport it to other necessary places, start initiatives for the production of value-added products from toddy, make necessary arrangements to store and preserve excess toddy produced during peak production season. The board would also take up initiatives to plant high-yielding toddy producing trees, construct permanent buildings to run toddy shops, conduct toddy shops as much as necessary, establish toddy parlours with modern facilities in tourism centres, provide necessary training to existing and new entrants in the toddy sector, keep statistical data on industry, open knowledge centres for workers and farmers and publish journals and encourage required research in this field. However, a decision on how the financial requirement of the board would be met while undertaking its duties has not been taken. According to the notification, the board shall have its own fund and all receipts of the board shall be credited thereto and all expenditure by the board shall be met therefrom. It also says that the board may accept assistance or loans from toddy workers’ welfare fund board. In addition to chairman of the board appointed by the government, the board will have a secretary (finance), secretary (taxes), excise commissioner, director of research of Kerala Agricultural University, chairman of Kerala toddy industry workers’ welfare fund board, one representatives each from recognized trade unions in toddy sector, two representatives from toddy shops licensees’ association and two representatives of coconut farmers. “Though the notification has been issued after deliberating on it for more than three years, the rules are still pending. It will have to be seen how the new government takes the proposal further,” said senior taxes department sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/no-rules-framed-yet-for-operations-of-toddy-board/articleshow/82133688.cms||KP Saikiran

---||Goa||Goa: ‘Be transparent about availability of meds, oxygen, vaccines’||PANAJI: With Covid-19 cases rising in Goa, opposition leader Digambar Kamat on Sunday urged the state government to issue regular bulletins on the availability of oxygen, medicines, and vaccines in Goa. Kamat said that transparency about the state’s preparedness will help prevent rumours and panic among people. The Congress MLA also asked chief minister Pramod Sawant to take pro-active steps to control the influx of people from other states. “With rising Covid cases in Goa, it is important that the government keep the people updated on its preparedness,” Kamat said. “I urge the chief minister Pramod Sawant to release daily stock reports of availability of medical oxygen, medicines, like Remdesivir, and Covid vaccines to avoid fear and panic in the minds of people.” The former chief minister pointed out that reports of medical oxygen shortage as well as medicines to treat Covid patients in Goa have begun emerging. He said that it is the responsibility of the state government to ensure that adequate stocks are maintained to take care of any emergency. “The government needs to show complete transparency about its plan of action to handle the current Covid situation,” Kamat said. He also said questioned the state government’s obstinate stance of asking students to physically appear for SSC and HSSC exams when the number of cases are on the rise. “The confusion created by the government with its decision to hold offline exams of SSC and HSSC is a result of the failure of the Goa government to prepare an academic action plan even after one year of outbreak of the Covid pandemic,” Kamat said. He has reiterated his demand that the state government needs to use the Intranet Optic Fibre Cable network to streamline online education in Goa. “Unfortunately, the government did not pay attention to our suggestion, which has now compelled the government to ask students to appear physically for the examinations risking their health,” he said. Kamat also said that the ongoing vaccination drive should not be used for political gains. He said that the state government should prioritise health and not economic gains.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Luxury tower exchanges hands as lender steps in to speed up project||Mumbai: The family of builder Pankaj Shah of Satellite Group has ceded control of its uber luxury residential tower, Sesen, at Nepeansea Road to Pune-based VTP Group.Shah, who gained development rights of the 1.2-acre bungalow property in 2005, was found dead inside the Oberoi Hotel during the November 26, 2008, terror attack on Mumbai. His son, Sarjan, took over the under-construction skyscraper project, where some of the 30 duplexes were sold for around Rs 75 crore each. However, the planned 66-storey tower remained stuck as Satellite was unable to procure further building permissions and had to pay back a Rs 340 crore loan to Indiabulls.“VTP group is the developer nominated by the lender (Indiabulls) to complete the project. We have acquiesced. Effectively, we have given them full control,” Sarjan Shah told TOI.The plot earlier belonged to the National Textiles Corporation (NTC) whose sole tenant was the late industrialist Kamal Morarka, who occupied the bungalow. Morarka and the senior Shah had tied up to redevelop the plot though a rival builder in 2005 had objected to the agreement on the ground that Morarka was only a tenant.The bungalow was demolished, and construction of the tower commenced. However, it remained incomplete because the developer was unable to get additional floor space index (FSI) from the NTC, which was to auction it.“Unfortunate as it is, after the father’s death, the son could not manage the project,” said a source. “Subsequently, development control rules have changed. Now the new developer can buy additional construction rights from anywhere to complete the project and does not have to depend on NTC’s FSI. The project requires quick implementation given the momentum in premium real estate. So, it’s best that a more established player with focus on construction takes over,” said the source.According to a joint development agreement signed between Satellite Group and VTP Group, the latter will be responsible for obtaining all pending approvals.“Expected revenue from the project will be approximately Rs 2,500 crore. VTP Group will be entitled to fees of 12% of revenue or Rs 200 crore, whichever is lower. As per latest reduction in rates of premium by government, the approval cost of the project has reduced by Rs 216 crore. Pending cost to complete the project will be Rs 630 crore,” said a market source.Of the 30 duplexes, 11 have been sold over the past decade and two more are on the verge of being sold. Each duplex is around 10,000 sq ft in size. While some were initially booked for Rs 75 crore each, a few are believed to have fetched around Rs 100 crore. Yes Bank co-founder, Rana Kapoor (currently in jail) and his family firms booked three duplexes in Sesen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-luxury-tower-exchanges-hands-as-lender-steps-in-to-speed-up-project/articleshow/82135362.cms||Nauzer Bharucha

The heat is intolerable, singeing almost, and Rajesh Singh, 35, who runs a small departmental store in Lahartara, is sweating profusely, waiting for his turn. His uncle has just died from Covid-19 and the funeral rites have to be done. The “manager” asks him for Rs 11,000. When Singh protests, saying it shouldn’t be more than Rs 5,000, the man asks him to leave with the body he has brought. Across cremation grounds in UP, harried kin of those who have fallen to the virus are being overcharged. And they have no recourse but to pay up. With bodies brought in unending piles, caretakers at these places have neither the time nor the patience to bargain. “The same wood and ‘samagri’ that were earlier available for Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 is now being sold for Rs 11,000 or more,” Singh told TOI on Sunday. “The quantity is also compromised, but you just can’t ask anything. Where will people go with dead bodies?” Another person, who didn’t want to be named, that this correspondent met said he was reduced to tears. “I lost my aunt on April 14. I paid Rs 22,000 for her cremation at Harishchandra Ghat. Then I lost my grandmother yesterday (Saturday) and this time I was made to shell out Rs 30,000. They said, ‘Forget the earlier rate, can’t you see how many bodies are in the queue?’ I had to give in.” He added, “Even after overcharging, the services are not satisfactory. The wooden logs, at times, are not sufficient. Often partially burnt logs are stuffed into fresh pyres.” It’s the same story at Meerut’s Surajkund cremation ground. A team led by local municipal commissioner Manish Bansal held talks with people of the ghat over pricing. Bansal said, “We were getting complaints that purohits (priests) are fleecing relatives of the dead. We held a meeting and told them the rate should be fixed. A rate list for all other items has also been put up now.” According to rough estimates from people staffing Harishchandra Ghat, in the last week alone at least 40 to 60 bodies were cremated on wooden pyres daily, up from 10-15 during pre-Covid times. The gas crematorium in Varanasi was inundated and just couldn’t take the load. After several complaints, the local administration seems to be finally waking up. “Now we have fixed rates for cremations. Someone who has died due to reason other than Covid-19 will be cremated at Rs 5,000. And Covid-19 victims for Rs 7,000,” Deepak Kumar, a sub-inspector posted at Assi outpost in Varanasi, said. “And for electric crematorium, it will be Rs 500. The community in charge of the burning ghats has agreed. We will put up a rate list prominently.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/soaring-cost-of-cremation-singes-families-of-dead/articleshow/82136043.cms||Piyush Rai
---||Chandigarh||In Haryana, 9 dists falter on contact tracing||Chandigarh: Prime Minister Narendera Modi and Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s formula to fight Covid-19 includes the “3 Ts” (tracing, testing and treatment), but nine out of 22 districts in the state have failed to meet the minimum criteria of contact tracing. All nine districts in Haryana which have an average of less than 10 contacts traced per case, have emerged as major hotspots. Haryana has an average of little over 10 contacts traced per infected person, which is not enough. Health authorities, especially health and home minister Anil Vij, have set a target of tracing up to 12-15 contacts of infected persons to control the disease. Once considered to be the worst-hit district and having earned the wrath of many on the account of detection of infected persons who attended the Tablighi Jamat event last year, Mewat has the highest rate of contact tracing with lesser Covid positive cases. Jind district is the worst performer in contact tracing with lowest ration. Ironically, districts which have emerged as worst hotspots are among the worst performers. According to records prepared by Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), Haryana, Nuh has contact tracing ratio of over 20 persons per infected person. After Nuh, Palwal has the second highest number of contacts traced per infected person, 16. The figure is 13 in Kaithal. Jind has the lowest ratio of little over five persons per patient, followed by 6.6 in Fatehabad, 7.45 in Faridabad, 7.79 in Panipat, 8.25 in Rewari, 8.75 in Mahendergarh, 8.81 in Charkhi Dadri, 9.25 in Yamunanagar, 9.36 in Rohtak, and 9.7 in Karnal district. Districts with borderline of over 10 but less than 11 contacts traced include Jhajjar, Sirsa, Ambala and Kurukshetra, while the districts which have the average of above 11 but below 12 contacts per infected patient include Sonipat, Panchkula, Gurugram, Hisar and Bhiwani. Panipat civil surgeon Sanjeev Grover expressed ignorance on the contact tracing ratio as he had joined two days ago. Jind CMO accepted low contact tracing. Dr Manjit Singh, the CMO, cited staff shortage. “Now we have got 200 Saksham workers who have been put on job. You shall see results by next week,’’ he said. Karnal civil surgeon Dr Yogesh Sharma expressed satisfaction and reasoned that most of the contacts of infected persons had got infections. “You take the case of Kunjpura; all students were contacts of each other. Otherwise, we are already working hard to improve contact tracing,’’ he said. Faridabad civil surgeon could not be reached. When contacted, Faridbad NIT MLA Neeraj Sharma assured to take up the issue with health authorities. “Concealing any information amounts to crime against humanity. All infected persons must provide health department the details of persons whom they had come in contact with. They should also motivate contacts to approach health authorities. Rest, we will also take up this issue with health department,’’ said Sharma. “All our health workers, medicos, para medicos and frontline workers are making all-out efforts to ensure adequate contact tracing as well as other issues related to surveillance. Patients and those who came in contact with them too must share this responsibility of coming forward. Else, our efforts are improving things,” said Usha Gupta, director, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), Haryana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/in-haryana-9-dists-falter-on-contact-tracing/articleshow/82134642.cms||Manvir Saini

In video clips that went viral on Sunday, opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis was seen engaged in a heated conversation with the police over the detention of Rajesh Dokania, a director of Bruck Pharma. Praveen Darekar, opposition leader in the council, also questioned the police. The police said they were acting on intelligence that remdesivir stock was going to be illegally flown abroad, but the BJP cried foul. Home minister orders inquiry into Fadnavis run-in with copsAfter the police took Bruck Pharma director Rajesh Dokania to the BKC police station for questioning over suspicious stock of the scarce drug remdesivir late on Saturday, the BJP said the government was harassing the company official because Bruck had been approached by the party to supply remdesivir to the state to fight Covid-19. Leaders of the oppositon Devendra Fadnavis and Praveen Darekar reached the police station and had a heated debated with the officials. State home minister Dilip Walse Patil said he had ordered an inquiry into the happenings at the police station. “It was highly improper on the part of Fadnavis and Darekar to interfere in police administration. The police were probing specific information. The owner [of Bruck] was called to the police station for more information. Nothing’s wrong with that,” he said. BJP MLC Prasad Lad, who said he had asked the Bruck manufacturing unit in Daman & Diu to supply the injections a few days ago, also accompanied Fadnavis and Darekar to the police station. While politicians from ruling parties made allegations of foul play and said there was a bar on procurement of the scarce drug by anyone other than the state government, Fadnavis said the pharmaceutical company had obtained all permissions and was providing the injections to the state and no one else. “The BJP is not purchasing the drug. We are procuring it for Maharashtra and the Food and Drugs Administration has given approval for it. If it were illegal, why would the FDA give the letter? In fact, two days ago Darekar met the minister and said the FDA should buy it. We never asked permission for BJP to buy it,” he said. Dokania had been questioned for over an hour and a half before Fadnavis’s arrival. DCP (Zone VIII) Manjunath Singe was questioning Dokania and officials from the Food and Drug Administration too were present. Dokania had been called for questioning from his Kandivli home around 8.30pm. The director of Bruck was allowed to return home around midnight, after Fadnavis, Darekar and Lad’s confrontation with the police officials. A police officer said they had information that remdesivir stock was going to be sent abroad by air cargo despite a ban on its export. The official said at least 60,000 vials of remdesivir had been stored Bruck Pharma at different locations in the city such as Vile Parle, Malad, Kandivli, and some South Mumbai locations. “The DCP and his team are probing the reason for the alleged stocking of 60,000 vials at the exporter’s unit instead of it being distributed in the local market at a time when chief minister Udhav Thackeray has repeatedly mentioned that they are falling short of the vials. There has been no case, seizure or arrest in the matter so far,” a police source said. In a press release issued late on Sunday, the police said Fadnavis enquired why the pharmaceutical company director had been called to the police station. He said permission was taken from the commissioner of FDA to donate the stock of remdesevir vials to the state Government, as remdesevir stocked for export could not be diverted to the domestic market without approval of the Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) or the FDA. The police said the communication from the FDA to the pharmaceutical company was not available with the BKC police Station, which was acting independently on the information that was available with it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-home-minister-orders-inquiry-into-fadnavis-run-in-with-cops/articleshow/82134721.cms||Clara Lewis

Edakkara police identified the arrested accused as Constan Xavier of Prize Villa at Karunechi. The video of Xavier dragging a dog along the road for a distance of around 3km on Saturday had gone viral. The dog could be saved after a social worker intercepted Xavier, following which he untied the animal from the vehicle. The dog, which sustained some injuries, is being taken care of by the emergency rescue force based at Nilambur. Police had registered case against him under section 429 (Mischief by killing or maiming…animal of the value of fifty rupees) of the IPC and Section 11 (1) (a) (torture or treating of any animal so as to subject it to unnecessary pain or suffering) of the Prevention of Cruelties to Animals Act. He was released on station bail. Edakkara inspector of police, Santosh Kumar said that the accused had taken the dog to abandon it, saying that it was creating problems to neighbours by catching chickens and also chewing footwear. “He claimed that it was not his pet and that the animal has been staying in the house premises.

The guidelines also have clear information for doctors on the kind of care and medication needed for positive patients on the basis of the severity of the infection. According to the guideline, those who have tested positive but are asymptomatic, and those with mild systems like only fever and diarrhoea without breathlessness/hypoxia, should be in home isolation or be at a safe home. But the home isolation should be under tele-consultation of a doctor who can keep tabs on parameters like temperature, pulse, BP and oxygen saturation. The guideline said parameters like oxygen saturation going below 95%, persistent and high-grade fever, breathing distress, chest pain and palpitation were warning signals to get the patient referred to a Covid-19 hospital. Otherwise, a 17-day home isolation is enough for a patient. “As the load is increasing on hospitals, triaging patients according to the level of infection is very important not only to lessen the burden on hospitals but also to ensure quality care. A good number of positive cases don’t really need hospital care,” said infectious diseases specialist Yogiraj Ray. The protocol by the health department said symptomatic patients above 60 years, or those who have co-morbidities like diabetes, chronic lung/kidney diseases or those who were immunocompromised but do not need oxygen support or need less than 10 litres per minute, can be admitted to a general Covid ward. They should be shifted to the ICU or HDU if they throw up any signal that the infection was getting severe. Patients who have problems like high-grade fever with oxygen saturation less than 95%, respiratory rate above 22/minute, respiratory distress and chest pain should be cared for at the ICU or HDU. They should be put on oxygen therapy along with a series of medicines, like steroids, anti-coagulants, anti-virals and antibiotics. In a couple of days, a team from Swasthya Bhawan will start doing the rounds of hospitals to see if the protocol is being adhered to. “There is a section of patients who wants to be in hospital care due to panic, even though they can be good in home isolation. With the kind of surge we are going through, the number of severe cases will rise. We need to judiciously use the hospital beds only for those who need it so that hospitals are not unnecessarily overwhelmed and so that people who really need hospital care get it,” said Anirban Dalui, public health specialist at Swasthya Bhawan. The guideline also specified the kind of investigative tests each category of patient should be subjected to during the hospital stay. “Such guidelines will definitely help in uniform treatment protocol being followed and also lessen the burden on hospitals. At the same time, the government will need to increase ICU/HDU beds as the number of patients who will require these facilities will keep rising,” said a doctor at a government Covid facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/stay-at-home-rule-for-asymptomatic-patients-to-ease-burden-on-hospitals/articleshow/82133716.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

According to the announcement by chief minister Ashok Gehlot, the government has started a process of cutting all the illegal water connections and will regularise them. After 15 days, the process of cutting the illegal water connection will start for which PHED has floated tenders and if the people wouldn’t regularise their connections, it will be difficult for them in ongoing summer season. In Jawahar Nagar slum area, more than 1,000 illegal water connections are said to be in use which department wants to get regularized, however, just 160 applications have been received in the last 45 days. According to officials of PHED, they have given a time frame till April 30 after which all those illegal connections will not be regularised. Manu Sharma, assistant engineer of PHED, said, “We are doing what we can from our side but if the public doesn’t respond properly then those connections will never be regularised. We will start cutting the illegal water pipeline and people will be left without any connection.” The cost of legal connection is around Rs 4,000 which is why people are not responding to the pleas at present. Although the population of the slum must be more than 25,000 but the waterlines are laid down in just 10 lanes that are adjacent to the highway.

The members of the committee went to the place where the verandah roof of three shops at Tripoliya Market collapsed two days ago, allegedly because of weak pillars. The committee members even stopped the repairs and demanded action against the responsible officials of Jaipur Smart City Pvt Ltd. The roof of shop no. 154 to 157 collapsed at 8.30am on Friday, although no one was injured. The repair of the verandahs of these shops were being carried out by Jaipur Smart City Pvt Limited. Samiti president Bharat Sharma blamed officials for sheer negligence. “On April 18, we celebrate World Heritage Day, but we wanted to mourn the death of heritage in the city. The administration is least concerned about the situation, the result of which was the collapse of the verandah. Renovation is under progress in the entire Tripoliya Market for the last six months, but the quality of work is not up to the mark. We want strict action against the officials,” said Sharma. Dinesh Goyal, superintendent engineer of Jaipur Smart City Ltd said, “Renovation is going on at these shops and soon it will be completed. On Sunday, some members of Dharohar Bachao Samiti stopped work. We will talk with them. There has been some cracks in the structures due to Metro work in the market, but we didn’t notice any such problem over there.” This was the second incident in six months when infrastructure of Unesco World Heritage Site had collapsed.

Subair said that though he received the notice, there was no mention of which case it was related to in the document that he received. ED sources hinted that the questioning was related to a preliminary enquiry based on information received by the agency on incidents of financial irregularities in which the leader was allegedly connected to. Earlier, Kunnamangalam police had registered a case against Subair and PK Firos, state general secretary of MYL, on the basis of a complaint by Yusuf Padanilam, former MYL national working committee member, that they misappropriated funds collected to help the victims of Kathua and Unnao sexual abuse cases. The case was registered under IPC section 420. Padanilam had said in the complaint that MYL had collected funds to provide legal support to the victims on April 20, 2018, after giving advertisements in newspapers.

With the latest Covid surge coinciding with the holy month of Ramzan, more people are trying to clear their doubts about the deadly virus and its vaccine by interacting with clerics through the online platform. Maulana Ishak Gora, who runs the free online service in Deoband, said, "A large number of people are coming forward these days with queries related to the pandemic. So, a panel of clerics was formed. And, a special online phone service has been started during Ramzan." The maulana added, "People from across the country are making calls. For instance, a caller recently wanted to know if someone has been infected by the virus and is still meeting others without disclosing it then what advice can be given to such a person under the Shariat law. Our cleric replied that the infected individual should remain in isolation, and if anyone tries to hide the disease then it is 'najayaz' and a big sin." Meanwhile, vice-chancellor of Darul Uloom Deoband, Maulana Abul Qasim Nomani, urged Muslims to strictly follow the government's Covid-19 guidelines. In a written statement, he said, "The Covid-19 second wave is here now. And the news we are hearing is worrisome. The toll and caseload are increasing daily. To break the chain, the state administration has imposed night curfew. It should be followed at all cost."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/follow-govts-covid-guidelines-hiding-disease-is-a-sin-say-deoband-ulemas/articleshow/82133005.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Could the local body elections have contributed to the current surge of Covid cases in Gujarat?The elections were held in February when cases in the state were very few — about 300 daily. The elections were scheduled in November, but given the Covid situation, the state election commission was requested to defer it. In an affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court, the commission had said that the polls would be conducted within three months. Thus, they were held. The rise in cases is a national phenomenon. Several states such as Maharashtra are recording a surge in cases though no election took place in those states in recent times. Ambulances are lining up outside government hospitals daily. What’s going wrong?We are at the Covid peak in cities such as Ahmedabad where even with the 14,000 overall bed capacity, private hospitals are nearly full. Thus, we are constantly increasing health infrastructure like beds in government hospitals and those run by the municipal corporation on a war footing. Of the 8,000-odd beds at Medicity, over 3,000 are earmarked for Covid patients. Yes, there are queues of ambulances. But one must understand that against 25 patients in the queue, there are 3,000 being treated inside the hospital. We are not sending anyone back. Patients are assured of beds and treatment. What about the rise in the death toll? Are the numbers showing the true picture of the pandemic?You are referring to the visuals of many pyres at crematoriums. Yes, deaths have increased over the past few days. The rise in Covid mortality has been recorded across the country. The method of recording Covid deaths has been stipulated by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and all states, including Gujarat, are following it. Other states are also not recording the deaths of comorbid patients as Covid fatalities. Across Indian states, the daily mortality rate hovers around 1%, which is closer to what Gujarat is reporting. But we can assure people that every death is being investigated and recorded by the death audit committee. Relatives have to endure a long wait to claim bodies…See, after a patient’s death, it takes about two hours for the death audit committee to complete its work. Then there are other procedures, including the identification of the deceased. We understand the sentiments of relatives. Thus, we have a system in place under which the officials release the body after coordination with crematoriums to reduce the waiting time. We are now also allowing the last rites of patients from outside the cities at their native places. Our purpose is to free the medical staff from this coordination function. Also, we have deployed over 22 IAS officers on Covid duty. Is Gujarat performing adequate tests? The state’s RT-PCR numbers were the lowest among the major states, according to a recent report.By March 15, Gujarat was performing about 50,000 daily tests. On April 17, the state performed 1.73 lakh. We have increased the share of RT-PCR tests in the total tests to 50% —whether they are performed in urban or rural areas. The labs are working round the clock, and we are ensuring that the test results are delivered within 48 hours. We are also keeping a close eye on the positivity rate. The state currently has a cumulative rate of 2.5%. Through the Itihas system, we are identifying potential areas with high positivity. The government is increasing the number of beds, but what about staff?Almost the entire staff of the state health department — about 2 lakh officers and personnel ranging from sanitation workers to medical superintendents — is on Covid duty. Right from superspecialty doctors to medical interns, all are treating Covid patients. Besides, the doctors are also required for initiatives such as Dhanvantari Rath, Sanjivani Rath, 104 fever helpline and so on. For this, we have roped in all the PG students, final-year MBBS students, and all AYUSH and homoeopathic doctors. Two decades ago, the state had only 11 medical colleges; now it has 41. Hospitals and medical colleges in areas like Dahod are catering to a large local population. Likewise, we are also pooling in all available nursing staff and students. We are incentivizing resident doctors with stipends of Rs 25,000 and intern doctors with Rs 5,000. The medical students’ bond period is also considered during their Covid duty, which is a plus for them. How equipped is Gujarat in terms of Covid medicines? Were the queues outside hospitals for remdesivir a wake-up call?Gujarat is producing about 30,000 remdesivir injections daily. Of that, about 17,000 are being procured by the state government. We have a system in place where even private hospitals are provided the injections at their doorsteps. We have ensured several steps to prevent profiteering. Likewise, the state is also keeping a close eye on other medicines required for Covid patients. We have procured over 15.3 lakh favipiravir tablets, of which 2.4 lakh are currently with hospitals. What steps are being taken to ensure the prevention of Covid spread from other parts of the country in the wake of major events such as Kumbh Mela?We have already issued an order to not only screen, but also conduct the RT-PCR test for all returning from the Kumbh Mela. We have chowkies at the state border to screen every person and check whether they have valid RT-PCR negative certificates issued within the stipulated period. Stringent checks are implemented at railway stations, airports and bus depots. Moreover, the focus now is to create more micro-containment zones to prevent the spread. Gujarat currently has over 22,000 such zones where 13,000 teams of medical staff are carrying out tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/adding-health-infra-on-war-footing-cm/articleshow/82134767.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Goa||Iranian champions Persepolis set to test FC Goa’s resolve in ACL||Margao: FC Goa coach Juan Ferrando has told his players they would have to work “three times as hard” as Persepolis FC if they have to get anything out of their AFC Champions League group encounter at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Tuesday. Goa have enjoyed a phenomenal debut in Asian football’s top-tier club competition with draws against Al Rayyan (Qatar) and Al Wahda. In the last game against the UAE side, Ferrando’s team even had chances to steal all three points but lacked the final touch. The defence – yet to concede a goal in 180 minutes – and goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh, in particular, has come for special praise from opponents. But while Goa survived the barrage of attacks in the first two games, Persepolis would offer a much fiercer challenge. The Iran Pro League champions, after all, have made it to the final twice in the last three years and remain the strongest team, not just in group E but also the competition. “Everyone knows what happened in last (year’s) AFC Champions League,” said Ferrando. “We have just one day to prepare for this game. This is a first for everyone. We need to remain focused, and in the end, we will see what happens.” With two exhaustive games in the last six days, Ferrando may have to tweak his lineup to bring fresher legs against the Iranian champions. One will be out of compulsion – Alexander Romario remains suspended – while he has the choice of deciding to hand the likes of Redeem Tlang and Princeton Rebello a start. “Against Persepolis, it won’t be about tactical decisions. It’s necessary to have the right mentality. It’s necessary to be hungry (for success). If we concede one goal, we have to remain strong and stick to our plan. We have to play as a team. “Goa must work three times more than Persepolis. It’s important to focus every second. If not, there will be big problems. We all saw what happened in the last game against Al Rayyan. That’s a good example for Asia,” said Ferrando. Persepolis won both their games so far – against stronger opponents in the group – with their 3-1 win against Al Rayyan showing just why they are the most dangerous. Down by a first-half goal, the Iranians turned the match on its head with three goals in nine minutes after the change of ends and forced 10 saves from the Qatar goalkeeper. “This game is going to be a good fight between the defence of Goa and forwards of Persepolis,” said coach Yahya Golmohammadi. Golmohammadi warned his team not to take the debutants lightly, even though there is a gulf of difference in quality and experience between the two teams. “Goa are a very good side and have good technique,” said the coach. “They run a lot. They stopped two good teams and these draws were not lucky at all. I think they are the surprise package in the Champions League so far.” Should Goa get anything from their next game, that would be the biggest surprise of them all.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/iranian-champions-persepolis-set-to-test-fc-goas-resolve-in-acl/articleshow/82150793.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The court had earlier asked the department to finalise the draft of the policy at the earliest and intimate it about the same. Farmers belonging to scheduled caste and scheduled tribe are provided power connection immediately on demand and on nominal charges (demand notice). “When the matter was raised by me in the disability court, the energy department had stated in the court that the provision of providing power connection to Divyang farmers on the same pattern as SC/ST will be taken up during the meeting to draft the new energy policy. Later, the department wrote to JVVNL, citing reminders issued by the disability court, seeking a factual report on the matter,” said Hemant Bhai Goyal, national vice-president, Divyang Adhikar Mahasangh. Goyal has also written to chief secretary Niranjan Arya demanding nomination for persons with disability (PWDs) in panchayati raj department, power connection for Divyang farmers, reservation in NREGA work, reservation for PwDs in private sector jobs and priority to PwDs in notary public vacancies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/power-connection-for-divyang-farmers-on-sc/st-pattern-factual-report-sought-from-jvvnl/articleshow/82133713.cms||---
---||Kochi||Guest workers create ruckus at railway station||Kochi: At a time when Covid cases are increasing all over the country with people being told to avoid crowds and maintain social distancing norms, hundreds of migrant workers faced a harrowing experience in Aluva over wait-listed tickets on Saturday. On Saturday night, hundreds of migrant workers, armed with wait-listed ticket reached Aluva railway station to board Shalimar Express train to go home. But, they were forced return to their rented places as their tickets were not confirmed and they couldn’t board the train. This caused some ruckus at the railway station as hundreds of them were not issued refunds after the train left the station. Some railway officials said issuing hundreds of waiting tickets should be avoided at this juncture considering the Covid situation. They said that there was a need to avoid unnecessary gathering of passengers. Other senior officials said the system was already in place earlier and these passengers had the chance to secure refunds 30 minutes before the train arrived. Shalimar express usually witnesses a huge rush of migrant workers. With railways running only special trains due to Covid, passengers with reserved tickets are allowed to travel. “As railways is issuing hundreds of wait-listed tickets, these hapless workers, who make both ends meet with daily wages reach railway station hoping to board the train. Earlier, when their wait-listed tickets were not confirmed, passengers could board the train in a general compartment. Now, no general tickets are allowed,” said a railways staff. When the ticket is not confirmed, railways allows refund 30 minutes before arrival of train. After that system won’t accept request for a refund. On Saturday night, hundreds did not get refund as there were many passengers with waiting tickets. To get it refunded later is cumbersome process that involves approaching commercial branch and submitting forms with details of bank account, added the railway staff. Meanwhile a senior official in Thiruvananthapuram said passengers with wait-listed ticket reach the stations determined to board the train. “They will be refunded next day between 8am and 11am. They made ruckus on Saturday night after the train left,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/guest-workers-create-ruckus-at-railway-station/articleshow/82133732.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Gadkari plans to cut road accident deaths by half in 4 years||Nagpur: The minister of road transport and highways (MoRTH) Nitin Gadkari has prepared a roadmap to cut deaths due to accidents on highways by half in four years. Addressing a webinar hosted by the International Institute of Security & Safety Management (IISSM), Delhi, Gadkari said, “Every year over 1.5 lakh people die and 5 lakh are injured in the country in road accidents. By 2025, we plan to reduce the number of deaths to 50% and to zero by 2030.” Gadkari said the ‘Stockholm Declaration’ adopted at the 3rd global ministerial conference on road safety in Sweden held in February 2020 called for a reduction of road accidents by 50% by 2030. “However, we plan to achieve this by 2025,” the minister said. Gadkari said his ministry was focusing on engineering, effective implementation, training and strengthening of emergency services and has already amended the Motor Vehicles Act (MVA), 2019, and now it’s the responsibility of the Centre and states to follow the Act. Road safety is an urgent health and development matter. The number of deaths on the world’s roads remains unacceptably high, with an estimated 13.5 lakh people killed each year. In addition, as many as 5 crore people are injured. Road traffic crashes are the eighth leading cause of death globally for people of all ages and the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5–29 years. “Death percentage of people between 18-45 years is 70%. Road traffic deaths and injuries shatter lives and throw families into poverty. On average, they cost the countries 3.14% of their GDP. If we could stop this loss, the countries could save Rs 1 crore towards every person,” said Gadkari. “We have already started implementing the roadmap by creating awareness among drivers, road safety drives at school levels. The country needs 22 lakh drivers and to meet the target we have already started training centres. In Nagpur, NGO Jan Akrosh is creating awareness drives on road safety,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gadkari-plans-to-cut-road-accident-deaths-by-half-in-4-years/articleshow/82133020.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: NKDA to seek nod for vax drive in gated societies||KOLKATA: In the wake of the spike in Covid cases, the New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) will seek permission from health department authorities on Monday for plans to conduct off-site vaccination drives in gated communities and housing blocks. The authorities are asking residents of gated communities and housing blocks if they are interested in having vaccination drives within the complexes. “We are asking them to let us know how many residents want to get vaccinated so that our health workers can conduct off-site vaccination subject to approval from the health department, and provided nurses and vaccines are supplied from the district health unit. We are also urging the residents’ welfare associations to set up isolation rooms,” said a senior NKDA official, adding that private hospitals have also been urged to seek permission from the health department for off-site vaccination in gated communities. NKDA is also planning to introduce mobile rapid antigen test drives using ambulances from this week. “The plan is to conduct the rapid antigen tests in the markets and other busy places in the morning peak hours. The rapid antigen test centre at AA3, which was closed due to polls, will resume operations from Monday. We have also urged the RT-PCR kiosks, run by two diagnostic centres at the NKDA Mela ground earlier, to start functioning again from next week,” said an official. The safe house in New Town that was being used as a vaccination centre will be re-introduced as a safe house from Tuesday with more beds. An upcoming banquet hall near the bus terminus in Action Area I will be temporarily converted into a vaccination centre. Another vaccination centre is running at CB Block market community hall, said NKDA chairman Debashis Sen. Bidhannagar, which has been logging over 250 new cases daily, reported a record of over 300 new cases on Saturday. Active cases have risen to over 2,000 now. Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation plans to increase vaccination centres, subject to availability of vaccines. BMC is operating about 10 vaccination centres at present — at three civic body-run hospitals and seven primary health centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nkda-to-seek-nod-for-vax-drive-in-gated-societies/articleshow/82133726.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Nagpur||Will ram coronavirus down Fadnavis throat: Sena MLA Gaikwad||Nagpur: Shiv Sena MLA Sanjay Gaikwad refused to apologize for his comments about infecting leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis with Covid-19, on Sunday evening. Earlier in the day, the Buldhana MLA had said, “If I get a hand on coronavirus, I would put it in Fadnavis’ mouth.” This sparked outrage among BJP workers across the state who demanded an apology and his arrest.Gaikwad told TOI, “I stand by my statements because it’s the frustration and anger of people speaking. Everyone has seen the dirty politics (over Covid-19) which BJP is playing with Maharashtra and Fadnavis is the face of it.” Former energy minister and senior BJP leader Chandrashekhar Bawankule, however, wasn’t understanding. “I am convinced that Gaikwad is in need of urgent treatment for mental health. Even though his party is in power, he’s acting like the opposition and blaming BJP for problems, which have in fact been caused by Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA),” said Bawankule. BJP MLC Girish Vyas said Gaikwad was trying to punch above his weight. “Gaikwad’s statement simply shows the level of frustration in the government. Just to hide their failure, their MLAs have now started to play the blame game. Regardless, Gaikwad is a political nobody and his statements are unparliamentary,” said Vyas. Gaikwad said his statements are simply a “reflection of ground reality”. He said, “Daily I am seeing bodies piling up and patients hanging on to dear life only because vital medicines are not being made available. It is Fadnavis and his party leaders who are creating a false impression in the minds of people regarding our government. Fadnavis has been speaking so much against Maharashtra that he has shamed the entire state.”Meanwhile, BJP and Shiv Sena supporters clashed at Buldhana today over statement made against Fadnavis by Gaikwad.While speaking to TOI, Gaikwad alleged that BJP workers had gathered to burn his effigy. “Around 25 of them gathered at Jai Stambh chowk to burn my effigy. A dozen of my supporters snatched that effigy and during that a scuffle ensued,” said Gaikwad.He said that while police case has been filed against both party members, there was still a question mark over gathering of people at the spot. “How did so many BJP people gather at the chowk with my effigy even though restrictions are in place. My supporters only went there as a response to their presence,” said Rathod.Use Rs100 crore lying in mining foundation fund: BawankuleFormer energy minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule said Nagpur district authorities must immediately use the Rs100 crore corpus lying in mining foundation fund. This fund is built up using royalty from mining activities. “It takes roughly around Rs2.5 crore to set up a 50-bed hospital with oxygen concentrators. Hotels can be taken over by government and turned into 50 bed hospitals,” said Bawankule. He added that there is no restriction on the use from this corpus. “I know it for a fact that no special permission is required. The guardian minister can use the fund for this emergency use immediately,” said Bawankule. He also alleged that Nagpur is being deprived of its right share of vital drugs. “In Thane, patients are getting two or three Remdesivir injections whereas in Nagpur we are struggling to get even one. So how is this happening? Are some powerful ministers using their clout to divert the medicine stock,” asked Bawankule.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/will-ram-coronavirus-down-fadnavis-throat-sena-mla-gaikwad/articleshow/82134451.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Admitting that the city’s critical bed supply was almost matching up to the demand, additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that around 80 high definition unit beds will be added in the next few days. “Patients can be stabilised in HDU units and further course of treatment can be decided,” he said. While cases appear to have stabilised, Kakani said the next two weeks would be critical with the beginning of reverse migration. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said that patients should consult a doctor as soon as they develop symptoms and not delay getting tested or isolating themselves. He added that the recovery rate in the state had dropped to 80.9%. While there were additions, as many as 45,654 persons also got discharged from various hospitals, taking the count of recovered people to 31,06,828.

The woman and children of this district’s Kanalsi village stood inside the waters with placards of appeal for saving the river from indiscriminate mining. They were all from the Yamuna Nadi Mitra Mandli, which celebrates the river’s birthday every year. Yamuna Sewa Samiti president Kiranpal Rana said: "Like every year, the villagers gathered on the riverbanks to offer prayers. Before ending our fast, we offered food to the Yamuna first. This year and the last, Covid-19 restrictions had forced us to limit the worshippers’ group but those who went to the river today found earth-movers and dug-up riverbed." The villagers alerted Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) member secretary S Narayanan and requested him to stop this "killing of the Yamuna river". Rana also filed a petition before the National Green Tribunal (NGT), which has instructed the state government to form district-level committees to check mechanised mining of the Yamuna."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/worshippers-find-ravaged-river-on-yamuna-jayanti/articleshow/82134731.cms||JK Singh

On Sunday, Maharashtra saw its highest singleday addition of positive cases ever at 68,631, pushing the state’s overall total to 38,39,338. This was the fourth straight day of the state clocking over 60,000 positive cases. The state has recorded an average of 57,000 cases daily in April.   Over 500 coronavirus deaths were reported on Sunday, the highest single day count in seven months. The 503 fatalities took the state’s cumulative toll to 60,473. Mumbai’s cases steadied at 8,468 new detections, although for the fifth day the city added over 50 casualties. The city’s total caseload reached 5,79,486 while overall fatalities touched 12,354. Active cases for Maharashtra stood at 6,70,388 on Sunday, and that of Mumbai 86,688. Of the 53 deaths in Mumbai, 26 had comorbidities. As many as 16 deaths occurred in people between 40 and 60 years of age; 35 were above 60. On a day cabinet minster Aaditya Thackeray of the Shiv Sena, who is also guardian minister of the Mumbai suburban district, said the state had started preparing for the third Covid wave, there was only one ventilator available for Covid patients in the private sector and 18 in the public hospitals in Mumbai. BMC says cases stabilising, but next two weeks criticalCovid-19 ICU beds in the city were down to 43 on Sunday. Of these, 32 were in public hospitals and 11 in private. Over 3,500 normal beds were available. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said that simultaneous plans were being drawn up to augment beds in the city and state. Admitting that the city’s critical bed supply was almost matching up to the demand, additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that around 80 high definition unit beds will be added in the next few days. “Patients can be stabilised in HDU units and further course of treatment can be decided,” he said. While cases appear to have stabilised, Kakani said the next two weeks would be critical with the beginning of reverse migration. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said that patients should consult a doctor as soon as they develop symptoms and not delay getting tested or isolating themselves. He added that the recovery rate in the state had dropped to 80.9%. While there were additions, as many as 45,654 persons also got discharged from various hospitals, taking the count of recovered people to 31,06,828. As on Sunday, Pune had the highest active cases at 1,22,486, while Thane with 86,732 active cases surpassed Mumbai. Nagpur, one of the worst hit in the second wave, had 73,485 persons under treatment, and Nashik had 42,563. The rest of the districts and cities had fewer than 20,000 active cases. Ahmednagar recorded the highest deaths in a single day at 61 among other districts and corporations. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region crossed 12 lakh cases on Sunday. Of the 503 deaths reported on Sunday, 210 occurred in the last 48 hours and 128 in the last week. The remaining 165 deaths occurred a week before that. Only eight out of the 61 districts and corporations in the state have recorded zero Covid deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-bmc-says-cases-stabilising-but-next-two-weeks-critical/articleshow/82136332.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Kochi||Thrissur Pooram organizers demand easing of curbs||THRISSUR: The Thrissur Pooram organizers are continuing their objections against the alleged ‘tight Covid-19 regulations’ even as social media campaigns are demanding deferring or scaling down of the festivities considering the rapid spread of the disease. The Pooram organizers and officials hope that the uncertainties will be resolved at the online meeting convened by the chief secretary on Monday. The district has reported 1,750 Covid positive cases on Sunday, which is significantly up from the previous day’s figure of 1,149. The test positivity rate has also shot up to 22% from19.2% recorded on Saturday. A group of writers and activists has appealed to the government and the organizers to defer the Pooram this year, due to the spread of Covid-19 in scary dimensions. Pointing out that Pooram acquires its completeness through the participation of the masses, they said it will be impractical to conduct the Pooram by adhering to the conditions like maintaining social distance. This could only also lead to excessive use of force by the police. The signatories to the appeal include Prof K G Sankarappillai, Vaisakhan, Aravindakshan, K Venu, Kalpetta Narayanan, Kusumam Joseph and Dr P Sailaja. Writer Vinod Chandran in a Facebook post suggested that the Pooram fans must seriously introspect whether they are celebrating life or death. The district collector S Shanavas convened a meeting of the office-bearers of the Paramekkavu and Thiruvambady devaswoms as well as the officials of various departments on Sunday to discuss the conduct of the Pooram on Sunday. A press release issued after the meeting said it has been decided to conduct the Pooram without losing its grandeur, but simultaneously adhering to Covid protocol. The collector informed the meeting that as per the direction from the state government, RT-PCR certificate will be mandatory for the Pooram spectators, or else they may have to produce documents establishing that they have taken two doses of vaccine. The Pooram organizers have demanded waiver of the condition that only those who have taken two doses of vaccine can participate in Pooram, according to Paramekkavu devaswom president Satish Menon. The devaswom secretary, G Rajesh, alleged that a well-crafted plan to sabotage the Pooram was being executed by the government by changing the Covid-related restrictions frequently. Thiruvambady devaswom president Prof Chandrasekharan said it will be tough to conduct Pooram with such conditions. The chief secretary has convened a meeting of the officials and Pooram organizers to take decision on the Covid regulations for Pooram, on Monday and the collector has assured the devaswoms that their concern will be reported to the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/organizers-demand-easing-of-curbs-for-pooram/articleshow/82133037.cms||T Ramavarman

The infected police officers and other staff have been placed under home quarantine and the Hayatnagar police station was sealed for the next 48 hours for sanitisation and disinfection. Confirming the development, Sambhal superintendent of police (city) Chakresh Mishra said, “After test reports of seven policemen posted at Hayatnagar police station found them positive for Covid-19, the police station was sealed for the next 48 hours during which a massive sanitisation and disinfection exercise would be carried out on the premises.” “During the lockdown period, the Hayatnagar police station will function from the Sarai Tareen police outpost. Therefore, any important development or crime taking place under its jurisdiction should be reported at the outpost,” added the SP. Divulging details, Hayatnagar police station SHO Satendra Bhadana told TOI, “Seven police personnel, including a sub-inspector, a head constable and five constables, have tested positive for Covid-19. I have tested negative and am under home quarantine. Others who tested negative have also been quarantined in their homes.” Sambhal police has, meanwhile, deputed inspector Raghu Raj Singh at Sarai Tareen police outpost to look after the functioning of Hayatnagar police station.

---||Kolkata||New Town residents’ forums to extend helping hand to seniors||Kolkata: Several gated communities in New Town have decided to resume the services they had started to help senior citizens and other members during the lockdown in March last year, following the sharp spike in Covid cases in the past few days.  The Residents’ Welfare Associations (RWAs) have decided that the services will include reaching out to senior citizens in the township and keeping track of their health. Volunteers will fetch them groceries and medicines from the stores. The New Town Residents’ Welfare Association has also decided to assist those affected to get a hospital bed depending on availability. “We have a high number of senior citizens staying alone in New Town. With the virus spreading again we must protect them. We have put together a team of volunteers from different housing complexes who will be the contact persons for these senior citizens. They will buy medicines, groceries and even chat with them at regular intervals to ensure they are not unwell,” said Samir Gupta, joint convenor of New Town RWA. Several residents contacted their RWAs during the lockdown last year seeking help. “While some people were not getting beds in hospitals, others could not get medicines or baby food. They would get in touch with us and we would help them through our volunteers. This time, too, we will be doing the same,” said Mainak Kanrar, secretary of the RWA at Sukhobrishti. Many residents have also pitched the idea of boycotting shops and service providers where owners and employees don’t wear masks. The RWAs have requested individuals to enlist themselves as volunteers. “We require more people to come forward. This will not only help us reach out to more people but also decrease chances of infection,” said an office bearer of New Town RWA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-town-residents-forums-to-extend-helping-hand-to-seniors/articleshow/82133746.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The western Uttar Pradesh district has added at least 1,000 Covid-19 positive cases in the last 48 hours. In return, after the procession completed a round of Salawatnagar village, the children were given toffees. Taking cognisance of the video, which had turned up on social media platforms, district magistrate Shailandra Singh ordered a probe on Sunday. Station house officer (SHO) of Mailani police station, Chandrabhan Yadav, said, “The videos and the pictures were cross-checked. It was found that the children were campaigning for Gurmeet Kaur, a private school teacher. She has filed her nomination from Salawatnagar gram panchayat in Mailani.” Salawatnagar is a gram panchayat with just 43% literacy rate, according to the 2011 census. Father of a nine-year-old boy, who was part of the group, told TOI, “We were not aware of what was happening. We initially thought that our children were playing. Later they started shouting slogans in favour of a candidate. My son later told me that he was offered a handful of toffees. This was not right as we keep our children away from election activities.” Additional superintendent of police Arun Kumar Singh told TOI, “A probe is on. An FIR will be registered against the candidate and her aides. This is a violation of model code of conduct and pandemic guidelines as well.” Gurmeet couldn’t be contacted for her comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/children-made-to-cheer-campaign-for-village-pradhan-candidate-dm-orders-probe/articleshow/82133067.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

With the declaration of Covid-19 as a state-specific disaster, the amount has been sanctioned from the state disaster response fund (SDRF) and it should be used only for activities in connection with the coronavirus disease, according to an order issued by principal secretary (revenue and disaster management) A Jayathilak. The funds should be utilized from the current year’s budget provision, and as per the conditions laid out in the SDRF norms. The expenditure details should be uploaded in the national disaster management expenditure portal (NDMIS) within one month of spending the funds, the order said. The government has also appointed as many as 10 IAS officers as “Covid Warriors” and deputed them to various districts to assist the district collectors in enforcing and coordinating measures to prevent the virus spread. The officers are: M G Rajamanickam (Malappuram), G R Gokul (Palakkad), Jafar Malik (Kasargod), Sheeba George (Kottayam), Vinay Goel (Thiruvananthapuram), Asif K Yusuf (Kollam), Afsana Perween (Ernakulam), Arun K Vijayan (Thrissur), Anupam Mishra (Kozhikode) and Snehil Kumar Singh (Kannur).

Those coming from other states will have to either undertake an RTPCR test or must undergo a mandatory quarantine for 14 days. The meeting also decided to take a day-to-day stock of oxygen availability, and store maximum available oxygen supplies. The state has a storage capacity of 219 metric tonnes. The meeting also decided to strictly implement testing, isolation and enforcement measures so as to reduce the test positivity rate significantly in the next seven days.

---||Kochi||Social justice dept comes up with new guidelines for old age homes||Thiruvananthapuram: The social justice department has come up with a set of comprehensive guidelines that should be followed by old age homes run by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the government. The guidelines have been issued in the wake of several incidents where senility or lack of awareness about the rights of senior citizens have been exploited by those running such institutions. The guidelines will be applicable to 619 old age homes run by various NGOs and 16 by the government in the state, in which there are approximately 20,000 inmates. As per the latest order compiling all the rules issued by the government, all such homes, including those which offer free services, should enter into an agreement with the inmate or their representative that will have full details of the individual, the reasons for residing in such homes, the details of relatives, their medical records, the services that they are seeking from such homes, the kind of food that they would prefer, the amount that the home charges for its services, the details of movable assets that the inmates have brought with them, including gold, etc. The old age homes should have details of the concerned person whom those assets will have to be handed over in case the inmate dies and how the body of the inmate should be cremated or whether the body should be handed over to relatives or for medical studies etc. Four copies of the agreement will be prepared and one each will be handed over to the inmate, the institution, district social justice officer and orphanage control board. All the services that will be offered and which cannot be offered will have to be made clear in advance, and a minimum of three inmates should be members of the board of management of the institution. In addition, there are also a set of regulations for the homes regarding the mandatory facilities that should be provided for operating such homes. All such homes should function only if there is a facility for providing accommodation to at least 15 inmates and there should be a minimum of 80.7 sq ft for a person to use his bed. A minimum of one washroom and toilet should be at the disposal of every eight inmates and those should be senior-citizen friendly, close to their residing rooms. Not more than 10 inmates can be allowed to reside inside a dormitory, and if the building is a rented one, the rent agreement should be for at least five years. There should be separate rooms for the staff and visitors and should have sick rooms. Of late, there have been complaints of office-bearers or staff cheating the inmates. In one such incident in Thrissur a couple of years ago that was reported to the social justice department, the then superintendent of a government home managed to fool a few inmates to purchase a vehicle in his name using the money of the inmates. The file demanding a disciplinary action against the official is still pending with the government without any action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/social-justice-dept-comes-up-with-new-guidelines-for-old-age-homes/articleshow/82133058.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Kolkata||Ashoknagar floats in oil dreams in poll season||Ashoknagar(N 24 Parganas) : Ashoknagar is growing up. The sleepy district town of not-so-distant past is witnessing a boom — floating in oil dreams. In 2018, oil and gas reserves were discovered on the outskirts of this town, just around 50km from Kolkata. And last November, ONGC put this area on India’s oil map after it was found that oil and gas extraction here could be commercially viable. So, the mofussil town, set up by Bidhan Chandra Roy around the Baigachi Airfield built by the British Royal Airforce during World War II to defend Kolkata, is now teeming with people in orange and red overalls and shops in Kachua and Gol Bazar markets are doing brisk business. Workers in fluorescent overalls can been seen purchasing cell phone chargers, getting their numbers recharged, purchasing groceries and eating out at local eateries. Ashoknagar is looking at a future of prosperity. Over the past few months, there has been an influx of workers, managers, government officials here. And with that, demand for accommodation, white goods and eateries has outpaced the supply. “This small town has a few hotels that are all reserved now. The oil company is renting spaces in the homes of residents,” said Samaresh Mazumdar, a resident of Ashoknagar Kalyangarh. Ashok Modak had a small shop of gift items in Gol Bazar. After the pandemic he shut the shop and started a small tea stall near the oil field. “The lockdown has affected everyone in this town. Many people have lost their jobs and others suffered huge losses. But oil field has come up as a boon with almost all households are gaining in some way or the other,” said Modal, who also recharges cell phones Market of electronic and white goods is already going through a boom in Ashoknagar with residents going on a buying spree for air-conditioners, washing machines, beds, mattresses, chairs and dinning tables. Residents are, however, scared that the discord between the state government and the Centre might mar the chances of Ashoknagar to make it to the oil map of the world. “We would want both the governments to set aside their political differences after the election and chalk out a roadmap on how to develop the area,” said Mazumdar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ashoknagar-floats-in-oil-dreams-in-poll-season/articleshow/82133757.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Later in the day, Shiv Sena and BJP workers clashed in Buldhana. “If I get a hand on the coronavirus, I would put it in Fadnavis’s mouth,” Gaikwad had said before the clash. Gaikwad alleged that the clash occurred because about 25 BJP workers had gathered to burn his effigy at Jai Stambh chowk. “A dozen of my supporters snatched away that effigy and during that a scuffle ensued,” Gaikwad said. He said that while a police case was filed against members of both parties, it should be explained how so many BJP people gathered at the chowk with his effigy despite Covid-19 restrictions. “My supporters only went there as a response to their presence,” he said. Gaikwad’s remarks on Fadnavis sparked outrage among BJP workers across the state and they demanded an apology and his arrest. Gaikwad refused to apologise and said his remarks were the frustration and anger of the people finding voice through him. “Everyone has seen the dirty politics [over Covid-19] which the BJP is playing with Maharashtra and Fadnavis is the face of it,” he said. Former energy minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule of the BJP said he was convinced that Gaikwad was in need of urgent mental health treatment. “Even though his party is in power, he’s acting like the opposition and blaming the BJP for problems, which have in fact been caused by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA),” he said. BJP MLC Girish Vyas said Gaikwad’s statement showed the level of frustration in the government. “Just to hide their failure, their MLAs have now started to play the blame game. Regardless, Gaikwad is a political nobody and his statements are unparliamentary,” Vyas said. Gaikwad said his statements are simply a “reflection of ground reality”. He said that every day he I am seeing bodies piling up and patients hanging on to life by a thread only because vital medicines were not being made available. “It is Fadnavis and his party leaders who are creating a false impression in the minds of people about our government. Fadnavis has been speaking so much against Maharashtra that he has shamed the entire state,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-will-ram-coronavirus-down-fadnavis-throat-says-sena-mla/articleshow/82134843.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Nagpur||43 die at home, 518 within 48 hrs of hospitalization in last 46 days||Nagpur: Of the total patients from district who died of Covid-19 in 31 days of March and 15 days of April, 43 passed away at home and 518 within 48 hours of hospitalization. Late testing, delayed hospitalization and failure to get beds in hospitals are the main reasons behind these deaths, as per officials, activist and expert. The district has registered 1,699 fatalities in 31 days of March and 15 days of April. Of them, 1,572 were residents of the district and 127 were patients from other districts who tested positive and passed away during treatment in hospitals of the district. The second wave of the pandemic hit the district from third week of February. Though cases increased from beginning of March, the toll started mounting from third week of March. The second wave is severe as compared to first one as far as number of cases and fatalities are concerned. As per analysis of deaths done by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and district office of Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, 16 Covid-19 patients died at home in March while the toll of such patients was 27 in April. Of the total 1,572 deceased who were residents of the district, 518 (32.95%) died within 48 hours of hospitalization in these 46 days. Forty-six patients died before reaching the hospitals. Of the total deceased, 145 patients died within 12 hours of hospitalization, 208 succumbed within 12 and 24 hours and 119 within 24 to 48 hours. The number of patients who survived initially but passed away within 48-72 hours of hospitalization was 276. Highest number of 735 deaths was recorded after 72 hours of hospitalization. The number of brought dead and deaths registered within 48 hours of hospitalization is high in rural areas as compared tp the city. According to municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B, deaths at home, brought dead and fatalities within 48 hours of hospitalization are mostly due to late diagnosis and admission in hospitals. “Some patients were brought to hospitals in critical condition and died after testing positive. Testing with onset of symptoms and hospitalization, especially of senior citizens, comorbid witnessing oxygen saturation level below normal range is very important to prevent deaths,” he told TOI. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde too said delay in diagnosis and treatment has caused deaths. “But now delay or non-access to medical care is also causing deaths. This may lead to further increase in deaths in April. It’s tough to prevent deaths when healthcare system has collapsed. Makeshift hospitals can reduce burden on tertiary care hospitals and save sick patients by ensuring early treatment and preventing further deterioration of condition,” he said. As per activist Narayan Ahuja, NMC, district administration and Zilla Parishad (ZP) have no monitoring system for patients in home isolation. “Majority of people are doing test with onset of symptoms, which is evident from high daily testing numbers of the district. Proper monitoring of patients in home isolation can prevent deaths. Patients and their relatives start searching for beds when condition starts deteriorating,” he said. Ahuja said that deaths can also be prevented if patients get beds on time. “Patients are not getting beds in ICU and beds with ventilators. Many private hospitals are not admitting senior citizens, comorbid and patients having oxygen saturation level below 85. Otherwise, we have seen throughout the year that patients, especially comorbid and bedridden too have recovered when testing was done on time followed by immediate treatment,” he said. The activist suggested avoiding home isolation in case of senior citizens and comorbid patients. “They should be monitored in Covid care centres (CCCs) in case having mild or moderate symptoms in the initial stage,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/43-die-at-home-518-within-48-hrs-of-hospitalization-in-last-46-days/articleshow/82133762.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The ministry of electronics and information technology has recommended the state to go for e-auction method using an exclusive software that can be a one-stop solution for all government auctions. The Centre has written to chief secretary V P Joy to consider utilizing the e-auction software developed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC) for government departments. In his letter, ministry of electronics and information technology secretary Ajay Sawhney has said that the e-auction software developed by the NIC is generic in nature and can be easily adopted for most auctions carried out by government departments. “It aims at facilitating transparency and non-discrimination amongst bidders and allows free access to the auction documents, clarifications and online submission of quotes in a faster and secure environment, adopting the industry standard open technologies. The application has been designed to facilitate a free, fair and transparent process,” he said. The software developed by NIC can cater to commodity auction, that is being used by Chandigarh for land and plot auctions, West Bengal for sand block auctions, Maharashtra for auction of forest produces, defence estate for tree auctions and even one of the most prestigious auctions — the auction of the most expensive and coveted gifts that have been received by the Prime Minister. As many as 4,000 gifts received by the Prime Minister have been auctioned through the e-auction software. Auction is the second-largest methodology adopted by the government, next to procurement, for running its business successfully. In the state too, auctions cover a wide range of spectrum, including vehicles of government departments, forest goods, forest products, sand, commercial plots, shops, scraps, etc. While some are disposed through e-auctioning, most of the auctions are physical ones. A government-owned e-auction system can help address vital issues, including maintaining transparency, access mechanism, data protection, secured hosting, confidentiality, privacy issues, etc. Last year, the government’s attempt to desilt the Pampa-Thriveni sand basin had ended up in the vigilance court, when the court ordered a preliminary inquiry into the alleged irregularities in sand mining. The petition by opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala that led to the court ordering a vigilance inquiry said that the government tried to sell off the sand that was accumulated in the floods of 2018, to a private company under the cover of Kerala Clays and Ceramics, a PSU, and caused a loss of Rs 10 crore to the state exchequer. At the same time, the state is procuring most resources for the government through the Centre’s government e-marketplace (GeM) portal or the state government’s tendering portal Tenders Kerala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/use-nics-online-auction-software-for-transparency/articleshow/82133075.cms||KP Saikiran

The current water year will end in 44 days but the water storage in 16 major hydel dams in the state was recorded at a healthy 42% on Sunday, said KSEB officials. The water storage in the hydel dams would be capable of generating 1,744.79 million units (mu) of power. The storage level in main hydel dams on Sunday was Idukki (40%), Pamba (55%), Sholayar (44%), Idamalayar (37%), Kundala (96%), Mattupetty (39%), Kuttiady (40%), Thariyode (18%), Anayirankal (34%), Ponmudi (52%), Neriamangalam (64%), Peringalkuthu (30%) and Lower Periyar (74%) The water level in Idukki reservoir on Sunday was 2342.46ft and it is capable of generating 866.26mu. The power consumption in the state on Saturday was 79.73mu. The power generation at Moolamattom power plant on Saturday was 6.46mu. Meanwhile, the power consumption reached an all-time record level in the state on March 19. The total power consumption in the state that day was 88.42mu, the highest-ever recorded in the state, said the data from state load dispatch centre (SLDC), Kalamassery. As per the data, the earlier highest-ever record of power consumption in the state was 88.34mu on May 23, 2019. It was the vote counting day of the last Lok Sabha elections. According to KSEB officials, the continuous summer rains in the last three weeks in major parts of the state helped to reduce the power consumption in the state. “After repeated summer rains, the power consumption was reduced by nearly 10mu per day. The power generation of Moolamattom power plant was reduced to 6-7 mu per day whereas it was 13-15 mu last month. Besides, the summer rains provided additional 61mu worth water in the hydel dams,” said officials. KSEB chief engineer (dam safety and DRIP) Supriya S said, “A healthy storage of 42% is capable for the hydel power generation till the arrival of monsoon in June. IMD has already predicted normal monsoon this year and it will help to get proper water storage in the monsoon season.” “As per the central water commission (CWC) the fixed rule curve for Idukki reservoir on June 10 is 2,373ft,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/storage-in-states-hydel-dams-healthy/articleshow/82133772.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Delhi||Beyond call of duty: Delhi cops rush oxygen, medicines to save lives||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police personnel turned saviours for many residents during the weekend curfew. From arranging oxygen cylinders for a hospital left with less than an hour’s supply, rushing patients to hospitals, arranging for food for isolated patients or arranging critical medicines like Remdesivir — policemen went beyond their call of duty on many occasions. On Sunday around 1.30pm, police received a frantic call of help from Mansa Ram Hospital in Nangloi in Outer district. The hospital said it had 35 critical Covid patients, but was running out of oxygen supply. The existing stock wouldn’t last for more than an hour, the hospital director said, adding that despite contacting all sources, oxygen cylinders could not be arranged. Realising that the lives of 35 patients were in danger, additional DCP Sudhanshu Dhama rushed teams to Mundka and Bawana. SHO of Nihal Vihar was tasked to coordinate with suppliers at Bawana and request for cylinders. The cops arranged 20 cylinders and delivered them to the hospital in the nick of time. The hospital director and kin of the patients were at loss of words to thank the police team. In another instance, SHO Bharat Nagar, Mohar Singh, managed to provide Remdesivir injections to Bhopal. The kin of a 67-year-old patient informed Singh that they had failed to arrange for the medicine. The SHO managed to acquire five vials of the injection and got it airlifted to Bhopal. The condition of the patient is now reported stable. Another Delhiite, Gaurav Bagga, contacted Kalkaji police station for oxygen for a patient in his family and received urgent help. Many such heartening incidents were reported from the city during the time of need. In New Friends Colony, a beat officer Devender turned saviour for a retired English literature professor of Delhi University. The former professor was unable to get her medicines, but the officer managed to deliver the drugs to her within the hour. An 85-year-old retired IAS officer was urgently issued a movement pass to go to a hospital by constable Babulal, who delivered it to his doorstep. Policemen also ensured that no needy person who approached for food was turned away. In Govindpuri, a daily-wage labourer ran out of ration and was starving for two days before she hesitantly called up police for help. The beat staff immediately arranged for ration like wheat flour, rice and oil. Another family in Kalkaji that had tested positive and was unable to get food as they were isolating received help immediately. In Dwarka Sector 13, police received a call about the death of a 93-year-old Covid positive woman at her home. SI Dharmender arranged for an ambulance so that she received due respect regarding last rites. Cops throughout the capital attended to calls of people needing help with a myriad of issues. North district police provided medical help for a sick woman unable to get help and got her necessary treatment though a doctor. Najafgarh cops received a call regarding a dead peacock, which was cremated according to the protocol. Police commissioner S N Shrivastava said that the weekend curfew threw many challenged before the cops. “Restrictions have to be enforced strictly in the interest of public health and safety while people in difficulties and emergencies are to be facilitated too. Delhi Police is executing their responsibilities in the best possible manner,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/beyond-call-of-duty-cops-rush-oxygen-meds-to-save-lives/articleshow/82134841.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Covid jitters make homes send maids on paid leave; complexes wait and watch||KOLKATA: Gariahat resident Subhashini Dutta on Saturday asked her domestic help Saraswati, who commutes daily in a local train from Laksmikantapur to stop coming from Sunday. “It isn’t very safe to travel now. We will call her back when the situation improves,” Dutta told Saraswati, assuring her that her pay will be protected. Rituparna Mukherjee from Lake Gardens has also asked Lakshmi, her domestic help from Sonarpur, to stop coming. “My son, who lives in England, wasn’t comfortable about her travel. If either of us contract the virus, there will be no one to look after us. So we decided to be cautious rather than sorry,” said Mukherjee. Ritesh Kohli, who lives in New Alipore and found out that the domestic help also worked in a house in the locality that had two members who had tested positive for Covid, has temporarily discontinued her services.“We asked her to go into quarantine. She has no symptom. We will wait a week and then get her tested before she resumes work,” he said. While several individual homes are discontinuing the services of domestic helps like they had done last year, housing complexes that had issued instructions to bar entry of domestic helps, drivers and other service-sector personnel, including plumbers and electricians, during the first wave, are on a wait-and-watch mode. Most have reactivated Covid protocols on sanitization and closed down common facilities. “We are being cautious without pressing the panic button. Having seen the consequences of what hardship it entails for the employer and more so for the employee, we have decided to be pragmatic this time. We have asked everyone to be properly masked,” said Arnab Bhowmick, lead member of the Covid task force at Greenwood Elements, New Town, which has shut common facilities like banquet hall, table tennis, football coaching, and re-introduced sanitization of elevators and lobbies four times a day. Samir Sharma of DLF Heights in New Town said the complex had also closed the club house, lawn, swimming pool and stocked masks at the entrance guard room to be handed to anyone who doesn’t have one. At Upohar complex along EM Bypass, movement of daily domestic help had been restricted to apartments in one tower. “This year, we have so far increased sanitization protocol and an instruction has been issued saying everyone must wear masks in public areas. We are monitoring the situation and will take a call as it evolves,” said the owners’ association secretary Nilanjan Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-jitters-make-homes-send-maids-on-paid-leave-complexes-wait-and-watch/articleshow/82133765.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

With bamboo groves in hundreds of acres of the 344 sq. km. sanctuary blooming over the last three months, tribespeople have been busy collecting and selling tonnes of bamboo rice. The gregarious flowering of bamboo is a phenomenon in which bamboo plants in an entire area blooms simultaneously. Bamboo rice is the seed of the dying bamboo at the end of its life span spanning from around 40-60 years. Though bamboo rice has been traditionally used by tribespeople, it has, in recent years, found many takers outside the forests for its perceived health benefits. The family of Raghavan, a Kattunayikka tribesman from Chethalayam, has sold over 300kg of bamboo rice at Rs 350 per kg during the last three months. "It has come as an unexpected income for us as there is not much work due to the Covid pandemic. We still have around one-and-a-half quintal of rice with us but we are holding it as the price has now come down," said Raghavan hailing from Kombanmoola colony. Saudamini, a non-tribal woman from Kenichira said that within 18 days, she was able to gather 77 kg of bamboo rice and got 56 kg of processed rice from it. "I was able to earn over 12,000 rupees in less than three weeks by selling 40 kg of dehusked rice to a merchant at Mananthavady," she added. Collecting bamboo rice, however, is a tedious job. "First we clean the ground around the bamboo clumps by removing the grass and small plants. Then we would sweep the ground using a broom to gather the bamboo rice which had fallen from the plants. We would remove soil and small stones from the collected rice and dry it in the sun and de husk it before selling it in the market," said Saudamini. Sasi Kumar, another tribesman hailing from Chethalayam, said that the summer rains in the recent days have almost brought an end to the activity. The Kallur tribal society has collected 7,000 kg of bamboo rice this season. Meanwhile, environmentalists said that gregarious flowering and the ensuing destruction of bamboo would rob the herbivorous wildlife of their staple fodder. “It would result in intensification of human-wildlife conflict as wild animals would enter agricultural land along the forest fringes if they experience a shortage of fodder. Also, the bamboo groves in the forest areas of Wayanad bordering Karnataka have been acting as a natural barrier against the hot winds coming from the Deccan Plateau to Wayanad,” Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) senior conservation officer Arul Badusha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/bamboo-rice-comes-to-the-rescue-of-tribals-by-opening-up-a-new-income-source-amid-pandemic/articleshow/82133099.cms||---

There were 121 such cases amounting to Rs 88, 80, 990, some of the cases even dating to 1993. The compensation was distributed at an adalat conducted as part of the special package for KSRTC. For several years, the corporation was unable to disburse the compensation packages that were being ordered to be given by various courts for such victims. The corporation had to give Rs 62 crore in 1,179 cases. As such compensation were mounting, the programme was formulated to disburse all these pending liabilities. Families of 121 victims, who opted for the interest-free settlement on national law adalat held on April 10 in association with the legal authority of the high court, received the settlement amount. “Those who have opted for interest-free settlement will receive the compensation within 15 days. Those who are interested in interest-free settlement and are to receive compensation amount less than Rs 5 lakh should apply at the respective units of KSRTC. Such application will be disposed of on a priority basis,” said KSRTC chairman and managing director Biju Prabhakar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ksrtc-distributes-compensation-to-victims-kin/articleshow/82133085.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A long queue of ambulances crawled for hours, one after another, and sped away after unloading the dead. The dead then waited for hours before making it to the pyre. According to the caretakers of Agra’s Tajganj crematorium, the number of bodies reaching for cremation has jumped by five fold in the last 24 hours. Since Saturday afternoon, 70 bodies were consigned to flames. Earlier, 15 bodies used to be cremated everyday on an average. Now the waiting time was over five hours. Meanwhile, the health department officials confirmed that four Covid-19 patients have succumbed in the last 24 hours. A caretaker of Tajganj crematorium said, “There has been a five time increase in the number of dead bodies reaching for cremation. In the last 24 hours, we have done 30 electric cremations and have lit 35 wood pyres. We have asked the family members of the deceased to wait as vacant space is not available for cremation.” A worker at an electric crematorium at Tajganj said, “We have four furnaces. One dead takes around 75 minutes. Machine is getting overheated, and we have to stop in between. I have not seen so many dead bodies reaching in one day.” Family members of deceased are not being allowed to enter inside the cremation area. Standing over 50-meter away, people were seen crying and sobbing. Usually, cremations are not conducted after sunset. But for the last three days, dead bodies are being cremated round the clock. Tajganj crematorium in-charge, Sanjeev Gupta said, “Following increase in number of dead bodies, district administration has ordered that the cremation should continue day and night.” Shahganj resident Shivendra Verma said, “My father had breathing problems two days ago. We were not able to get a bed in the hospital. He died at home today morning. We are waiting for cremation for the last two hours. Caretakers suggest that vacant space is not available, and we may have to wait for another 3-4 hours.” While in Moradabad, families were spotted struggling to get their loved ones cremated. Authorities at Moksha Dham cremation ground in Moradabad said that on Saturday, a total of 14 bodies arrived. Of which nine had succumbed to the infection of Covid-19. Crematorium authorities said that it has happened for the first time that all crematorium platforms were occupied simultaneously. “The crematorium has a total of 15 platforms for pyre. I don’t remember the last time when all the platforms were occupied with pyres lit at the same time. It is a terrifying view,” said manager at the crematorium, Sanjay. According to information from the health department, as many as 17 people died of Covid-19 at two Covid-19 care facilities in Moradabad on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/kin-of-dead-forced-to-wait-for-hours-as-bodies-pile-up-at-crematorium/articleshow/82133097.cms||Maria Khan

Many farmers have offered it free of cost for those who wanted it as they do not want to destroy the crop. K M Mohammed, an owner of a tapioca farm at Koduvalpara near Kuttipallam in Nalleppully, has put up a board in his farm stating that “those who need tapioca can take it free of cost or pay whatever they want. Even if nothing is paid, there is no problem.” He added that he did not want to destroy the produce and interested people can come and collect tapioca from his four-and-a-half acre farm, where production is estimated to be of 25 tonnes. Last season, one kilogram of tapioca fetched Rs 15 per kg. But this season, there is no takers to buy it even for Rs 3 per kg. Tapioca was sold at Rs 2 to Rs 3 per kg this season, he added. He had contacted Kerala state horticulture corporation to purchase it. Though they had promised to buy 500 kg every week, they did not turn up. He added that he had spent Rs 3 lakh, including loan from a bank, to cultivate tapioca this season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tapioca-farmers-struggle-to-find-buyers/articleshow/82133779.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Kochi||Night curfew imposed in Lakshadweep||KOCHI: The Lakshadweep Administration has imposed a night curfew and strengthened restrictions in the islands following a spurt in Covid cases in the archipelago. In the Islands of Andrott and Kalpeni where there are more cases, curfew is from 7 pm to 7 am while in the other eight islands it starts at 10 pm. According to the Department of Health Services of the administration, as of 6 pm on Sunday, there were 254 active cases in Andrott, including 99 fresh cases and two new cases taking the tally in Kalpeni to 44. In the entire archipelago that has a population of just over 60,000, the total number of active cases as of Sunday was 390. A total of 1,165 persons have been infected in the islands so far and one fatality was also reported. Five persons had to be evacuated, however, there were no patients who were on oxygen support, ventilators, or in an ICU as of Sunday evening. Sources said that the sudden increase in the islands can be attributed to visits made to the mainland, mostly for treatment purposes. “Due to stringent restrictions that lasted for months before the relaxation earlier this year, many had postponed their visits to hospitals in Kochi. When the vacations began, several of the islanders travelled and came back," said a source with the administration. It is understood that testing is done mainly on people who travel from island to island or the mainland. As many as 1,360 tests took place from Saturday evening to Sunday evening and a total of 57, 376 persons have been tested so far. The vaccination drive in the islands is also progressing steadily. As of Sunday evening, 16,226 persons received the first dose of vaccination while 3,375 persons received the second dose. On Sunday, 271 persons were given the first dose and 68 others the second dose, sources said. On Friday, the administration had made it mandatory for the islanders to undergo seven-day home quarantine after they visit the mainland. Also, the administration made it compulsory to get prior permission from the incident commanders to travel to the mainland.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/curfew-imposed-in-lakshadweep/articleshow/82133111.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Tocilizumab, used for critical Covid patients, not in market||Nagpur: Tocilizumab, earlier used for treating rheumatoid arthritis including that in children, has become the most sought-after drug under the brand name Actemra for treating critically-ill Covid patients. Though priced at more than Rs41,000 for each vial, Tocilizumab injection is believed to have reduced deaths in Covid but its high demand in the region has pushed the drug out of market since April 12. The shortage of this drug, like Remdesivir, is leading to black-marketing too with customers keen to pay double or treble the cost. Known to be effective against SARS-CoV-2, Tocilizumab, which had a limited sale in the past, has been seeing a sharp increase in demand rise since the start of Covid surge in February. According to an insider, the drug would be available in the city only after April 23. If an official source is to be believed, a stock of only 20 vials would land here next week which is expected to go off the shelf in no time as the distributors and stockists are already flooded with advance orders from people who are ready to pay whatever price it may cost. According to pharmaceutical and clinical experts, the drug, which is manufactured abroad, has a proven track record of mitigating the hyper-inflammatory complications associated with high progressive respiratory failure. Dr Nandu Kolwadkar, ear, nose and tongue (ENT) surgeon and Covid in-charge of Orange City Hospital, labelled Tocilizumab as a drug which effectively controls the cytokine storm and works against lung inflammation in Covid. “This drug is in short supply in the city pushing us into a difficult time,” he said. District collector Ravindra Thakare said he has urged the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) to keep a tab on stocks of Covid-related drugs in the pharmaceutical markets, especially the distributors and stockists. Sources in the pharmaceutical sector said the cheaper alternative of Tocilizumab is Itolizumab, which is sold as Alzumab, costing around Rs31,000 but it’s also getting wiped out as soon as some stock lands. “Alzumab had hardly any demand in the past but its sale has skyrocketed in the last couple of days,” said Murlidhar Kewalramani of Suresh Medical at Gandhibagh. Similarly, Immunocin Alpha 1 injection, which used for treating Covid in patients with comorbidities, too remains unavailable most of time. Enoxaparin drug, a popular anticoagulant or blood thinner, is considered effective in removing blood clots in Covid patients. Pharmacists said Enoxaparin too is in short-supply. Favipiravir drug, especially Fabiflu, too is not easily available most of the time. According to sources, Methylprednisolone, which is also effective in suppressing cytokine storms, improving oxygen saturation, heart rate and such conditions in Covid patients, too is not available easily. There is shortage of anti-bacterial Doxycycline and anti-parasitic Ivermectin too. Kailas Tandale, president of Maharashtra Registered Pharmacists Association, said the government must allow retail sale of the crucial medicines at couple of pharmacies in every taluka. “The pharmacists must maintain stock, record sales and purchases,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tocilizumab-used-for-critical-covid-patients-not-in-market/articleshow/82133778.cms||Soumitra Bose

The Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) in Aurangabad has kept aside 1,500 vials of the injection that will be provided to private hospitals through a centralised process monitored by the FDA and the district administration.FDA drug inspector Rajgopal Bajaj, the officer supervising the supply of remdesivir from the GMCH, said private hospitals can take remdesivir stocks on loan. “These hospitals will have to return the injections to the GMCH as and when supply is restored,” he said. “In the wake of acute remdesivir shortage, hospitals have been told to reserve the injection doses for critical patients. Patients’ relatives have been requested not to approach the help centre or FDA officials,” district collector Sunil Chavan said at a review meeting on Sunday.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 400 Matheran horses face starvation, owners seek aid||Navi Mumbai: More than 400 horses that tourists have sat astride on in picturesque Matheran are on the verge of facing a grim situation due to the lockdown-like curbs imposed in the state. With no tourists visiting the hill station due to the second wave of the pandemic, horse owners say the equines could face starvation in the days to come. They have appealed to the state government to bail them out of the uncertainty that looms. There are 235 owners who have 460 licensed horses in Matheran,” said Rakesh Kokale, a horse owner. The horses that usually transport tourists have been idling around currently and owners claim that they might not be able to provide them food due to loss of income in the absence of tourists. “The second lockdown has impacted our income... we cannot even afford basic food for our horses,” said Kokale. Typically, a horse’s diet comprises hay, wheat, oats and gram, he said, adding that horses require a healthy, nutritious diet which also includes apples and carrots. “To feed one horse, the average daily expense is around Rs 250,” Kokale said. On behalf of horse owners from Matheran, he said he has written to the guardian minister of Raigad district Aditi Tatkare on Saturday, urging her to consider help of Rs 1,500 for each horse owner for a month similar to what chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has announced for autorickshaw drivers. Another horse owner Karan Jankar said that if the financial help comes in, it will help the horses survive this tough time. “We will at least be able to buy wheat and sugarcane fodder for our horses,” said Jankar. The 26-year-old who has three horses said he is worried about what will happen if the restrictions are extended. “I shudder to think of what could happen. It will definitely ruin lives,” said Jankar. “Not just of our horses, but of our families too. We hope to get some help.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-400-matheran-horses-face-starvation-owners-seek-aid/articleshow/82135399.cms||George Mendonca
---||Goa||Al Wahda coach says there’s no level playing field in ACL||Margao: Al Wahda have accused the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) of treating them unfairly and providing their group rivals with an advantage in the AFC Champions League. The UAE side has one point from their first two games. They lost the opener against group favourites Persepolis FC and were then held to a goalless draw by hosts FC Goa at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda. However, coach Henk ten Cate said his team would have done better if the organisers had provided a level playing field. “For me, sports starts with honesty, equality. That everybody is treated the same. In this case, it’s not the same,” ten Cate said at the pre-match media briefing on Monday. The former Barcelona and Chelsea assistant coach said his team plays five of their six matches at 8pm, rather than a more comfortable kick off at 10.30pm. Since 90 percent of the players are Muslims and observe daylight hours fast during the holy month of Ramzan, they can eat or drink only at 7pm. “We play for the third time in a row at 8pm. We have to play five times. This is not fair. Other teams (like FC Goa) have five games at home at the best possible time. It’s not fair, not a level playing field. “I am really frustrated because my team is not doing well, surely. But I am also frustrated at the whole set up of the tournament. It’s not fair,” said the Al Wahda coach. Ten Cate also wondered if his team was being targeted on the field for the outburst against organisers. “We should have had three clear penalties, the opponents should have had two straight red cards which were not given. I wonder if it’s me being critical against AFC that this is the reason why my team is not treated fair. This is not a level playing field,” he said. Despite having just one point from their first two matches, the Dutch coach was confident that the battle for the second spot behind Persepolis would be between his team and Al Rayyan, with second-placed FC Goa out of the equation. “Al Rayyan play good football. I think they should have had more points than they have now. The same goes for us. It’s got to be between them and us for the second place in the group. Hopefully, it will be us,” he said. Al Wahda take on the might of Al Rayyan in their next group clash on Tuesday. It’s an early kick off at 8pm, something that the coach has continuously criticised. “Since we have six (group) games, why not have three (at 8pm) and three (at 10.30pm)? Why not treat all four teams the same and have a level playing field? This is very badly judged from the AFC. “We already have a disadvantage because my players cannot eat. Because its Ramadan. So, it would have been fair if we had the later schedule. Then they could have eaten (properly) and played,” said ten Cate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/al-wahda-coach-says-theres-no-level-playing-field-in-acl/articleshow/82150968.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No jabs at 35 pvt centres due to stockout, city’s vax coverage drops by 45% in 1 day||Covid-19 vaccination in the city has been hit once again due to shortage of vaccine doses. On Sunday, 35 private centres couldn’t carry out the drive due to a stockout. The coverage on Sunday dropped by more than 45% compared to Saturday. Civic officials said they had emptied their central depot and handed out even the last remaining vials to the vaccination centres. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the the city had stocks to last just a day or two. “We were down to 1.5 lakh doses, most of which has been distributed. If we don’t get stocks in a day or two, it will be testing time for us,” he said. The situation may worsen on Monday as more private centres may be forced to suspend their drive. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC executive health officer, said they have given priority to free vaccination centres. “We have given more stocks to free centres since the footfall is higher there. Many private centres may not be able to vaccinate on Monday,” she said, adding that Mumbai had got a small volume of doses in the middle of the week, but that got over sooon. On Sunday, only 27,189 could get inoculated in Mumbai, a sharp drop from 50,725 vaccinations achieved on Saturday. Across Maharashtra too, nearly 2.4 lakh people could take the vaccine, much less than the average of three lakh vaccinations the state has been clocking. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said that the state has created infrastructure to vaccinate over eight lakh people everyday, but the lack of supplies is hitting the entire drive. “We have not been able to scale up because of unavailability of adequate doses,” he added. Maharashtra has finished giving at least one dose to over 1.2 crore of the estimated three crore people in the target population. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-jabs-at-35-pvt-centres-due-to-stockout-citys-vax-coverage-drops-by-45-in-1-day/articleshow/82134868.cms||---

Several individuals and institutions have decided not to hold iftar get-togethers even this year as a precautionary measure, keeping in mind the safety of people. Organisers of iftar bazars across the city have directed shopkeepers and vendors to wear masks and set up their shops in such a manner that people have enough space to move around. “This year too, we urge everybody to follow all precautionary measures to ensure everybody’s safety. All shop owners and vendors have been instructed to wear masks and leave enough space for social distancing for the buyers,” said a representative of Calcutta Khilafat Committee that organises the market in central Kolkata’s Zakaria Street. Some of the institutions that have been holding iftar get-together for decades have decided otherwise this year. “It is not safe to organise Iftar in a Covid situation like this and so we have cancelled our Iftar events at the Calcutta Muslim Institute, Urdu Academy and West Bengal Haj Committee. Only a few weeks ago the situation was not serious like this and none is feeling safe any more,” said Nadimul Haque, Rajya Sabha MP and chief of the organisations. Many people have decided to donate the money to charity as Zakat, an Islamic levy. “This is also the time for Zakat or charity. Since, I have cancelled my Iftar and Id parties, I will distribute the entire money among the poor,” said Imran Zaki, a city-based businessman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/several-iftar-get-togethers-called-off-as-cov-cases-rise/articleshow/82133814.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Rathwa is the president of Ghoghamba taluka panchayat.Fifty-seven persons have died and over 5,270 infected by Covid-19 in Panchmahals district till date.Such was the level of cops’ ignorance that a group of youngsters, who were dancing on the road in Jhoj village as a part of the pre-wedding celebration even did not raise curiosity of the men in khaki who passed by them in a police jeep. Meanwhile, Harpalsinh Rathod, DySP, Halol, has been asked to inquire into the incident and submit a report to the Panchmahal SP within two days.Police said Rathwa’s son Anil was scheduled to get married on Sunday. “They had organized a dance party on Saturday night in which the huge crowd had gathered.

She also urged her party colleagues to scale down their campaign in parts of Kolkata that will go to polls in the next two phases on April 26 and 29. Speaking to a private TV channel, Mamata said her rally in north Kolkata’s Beadon Street on April 26 would be her only one in the city. Earlier in the day, Mamata wrote to PM Modi, flagging doctors’ concerns about “extremely scarce and uncertain” supplies of Remdesivir and Tocilizumab, two key medicines used to treat Covid-19. She also urged him to look into the “scarce and erratic” flow of vaccines into the state and ensure steady oxygen supply. The chief minister identified three areas that she said required the PM’s intervention “to scale up our capabilities to tackle the pandemic on a war footing”. She put availability of vaccines first, saying “focused and aggressive vaccination” was of critical importance, particularly in Kolkata due to its “high population density”. Stating that Bengal had been among the “best performers” in the initial phases of the vaccination programme, Mamata said the state was “now suffering” for no fault of her government. She also demanded PM Modi’s resignation over the nationwide Covid spike. Accusing Modi of misleading the nation and not planning, Mamata said: “All he says is he has to win Bengal.” BJP candidate hit by stray bullet: BJP’s Malda (SC) candidate Gopal Chandra Saha was hit by a stray bullet in his throat when he was busy campaigning in Old Malda city on Sunday.

---||Nagpur||Horrific scenes: O2 cylinders in parking lot, overcrowded OPD, no room in Mayo wards||Nagpur: There is a queue of nearly a dozen vehicles with patients inside, parked in front of the Covid outpatient department (OPD) of Indira Gandhi Government Medical College (IGGMC), popularly known as Mayo Hospital. There are ambulances, private cars and even autorickshaws with oxygen cylinders kept below the seat. The OPD is already bursting at the seams. Vijay Paradkar, in his thirties, is lying on the ground near a parking slot close by. He breathes from an oxygen cylinder kept next to him. His relatives have got one for Rs5,000 as they wait for his chance to be taken in at the OPD for examination. A few meters away is Darshana Thaokar, who has come with his 70-year-old mother Parbatabai. As Partabatabai waits in the ambulance, the daughter desperately hopes that she gets a bed at IGGMC. She lost her father last week, after the family tried in vain to get him admitted in a hospital. “He was unwell for a week, we continued treatment at home as hospital beds were not available. We called up different hospitals but could not get a bed, he succumbed. I hope this does not happen to my mother,” she said. In another ambulance, the person accompanying an aged patient said it was their second trip to Nagpur from Saoner. “We have been looking for a bed since three days. First we tried for one full day at Saoner, then drove down to Nagpur. This is our second trip,” he says. There were patients who had come to Mayo Hospital after not getting a bed even at Government Medical College (GMCH) or AIIMS apart from other private clinics. They said at private hospitals they were told there were neither beds nor oxygen. The beds are full at Mayo Hospital too. Patients entering the hospital have to first get registered, after which they are examined at the OPD and then sent to a ward if needed. The wards are already full, said dean Dr Ajay Keolia. “We have 550 beds, and there is no room at present. The patient is first examined at the OPD, which itself is overcrowded,” he said. Earlier, the OPD had a capacity of taking in six patients at a time, which was increased to 24 due to Covid. There may be easily more than 30 inside at present, said the dean.  An activist shared videos of an overcrowded OPD. Patients could be seen lying on the floor. Two shared a single bed. The officials admitted this was the situation. In the OPD, patients only get oxygen support and have to wait till a bed becomes available, which appears to be a far cry, said a source. The doctors manage to attend to patients waiting outside in the vehicles also, but sometimes it gets beyond their capacity. “Since last three days the situation has worsened,” said Keolia. Congress activist Bunty Shelke, who runs a help centre, said it was a hapless situation and the wait for beds has only got longer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/horrific-scenes-o2-cylinders-in-parking-lot-overcrowded-opd-no-room-in-mayo-wards/articleshow/82133878.cms||Shishir Arya

Restrictions on the number of people inside the church are being brought in by the archdiocese of Kolkata in the wake of the second wave of Covid. Till Sunday, 100 people were allowed into the church for services but archbishop Thomas D Souza said he “did not wish to take chances”. He is re-imposing restrictions and will review the situation towards the end of the month. For weddings, baptism and funerals, not more than 20 people will be allowed to come in, according to the new restrictions. “The situation is grave once again and we just cannot allow more than that. We have also asked priests not to go for house blessings and anointing of the sick for the moment,” he said, Each church will have to be sanitised at the end of every service, it was said. The earlier rules of hand sanitisation, distanced seating, masked entry, not touching the priest or kissing his cross will all continue, it was said. The Church of North India said the member churches are seeing much less than 100 people at a time. Most of its churches are huge and with less than one third the capacity coming in now, there is no need to immediately put a cap on the numbers further. “We are following the government orders in toto. At the moment 100 worshippers are allowed at a time and we are seeing far less than that on most days,” said Bishop Paritosh Canning, calling all church-goers to adhere to Covid norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/churches-ring-safety-bell-re-impose-restrictions/articleshow/82133869.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Chandigarh||City heritage cuts across national, temporal boundaries||Think of the awe inspiring stepwells of Gujarat, the sublime Taj Mahal and the iconic Sun Temple of Konark. Now, think of the Capitol Complex in Chandigarh (if you are able to conjure an image or two!). Remind yourself that they are all World Heritage Sites. But how can anything so recent and ‘modern’ be ‘heritage’? In a civilization as ancient and rich as ours – overflowing with jewels of natural, cultural and architectural splendour where does a humble group of buildings in concrete stand? And even if we, in Chandigarh, do take immense pride in them, why would they be of any significance to someone living in Ethiopia or England? These and many such questions reveal the archaic concept of heritage that we all still carry while the concept of modern heritage and its universal significance are yet to sink in. The Capitol is important because great architecture is never just about buildings and spaces and goes beyond mere aesthetics and functions to embody the ethos, values and vision of a populace at any given point of time. This unique ensemble celebrates the spirit of exaltation, power and permanence experienced by India on acquiring the prerogative of self-governance after a long and bitter struggle for freedom. The Capitol Complex is thus not just a testimony to Le Corbusier’s creative and philosophical genius but also a manifestation of the foresight, grit and perseverance of a group of Indians possessed by the dream of a new modern nation. And for those reasons it is our heritage while in inspiring many others like us all around the world, its value becomes universal — transcending national and temporal boundaries. The complete complex consists of the assembly, the high court and the secretariat buildings — celebrating the three pillars of democracy — legislature, judiciary and executive and four monuments articulating the plaza are the Open Hand, Martyrs’ Monument, Geometric Hill and Tower of Shadows. The ensemble has an ‘outstanding global influence’ being an important landmark in the progression of modern architecture and thought the world over. Here we were able to create secular, modern forms ‘unfettered by the past’ to create a nationalist idiom that was also unique to the world creating a transnational globalised work of art. The spirit of true democracy is clearly seen in the truthfulness of materials and honesty of expression of the structures, seamlessly blending the forward-looking ideas of Jawaharlal Nehru with the austerity and simplicity advocated by Mahatma Gandhi. At the same time these iconic creations ably addressed mundane yet critical aspects like services, climate control, structure, acoustics, rain water harvesting and even barrier free circulation. A case in point is the construction of the thin hyperboloid shell of the immense column-free, circular Assembly Hall was a landmark technical achievement and would be hard to replicate even today. One is constantly surprised by the meticulous planning, intelligent detailing and high quality execution of the structures which speaks volumes about the dedication of the engineers, contractors and even untrained labour. On a philosophical level the complex celebrates the sacred Man-Cosmos relationship — an aspect reflected in the very planning of the buildings and their interrelationship with the Shivalik hills beyond. Intangible concepts of democracy and egalitarian society are reflected in the absence of plinths and barriers where the common man is in fact the hero. If we could only understand the true meaning of the Open Hand or decode the many symbols and details worshiping nature and the sun here, we would indeed understand why Chandigarh’s heritage is a universally appreciated ‘world heritage’ that will continue to be relevant for years to come. Unesco defines World Heritage as “the designation for places on Earth that are of outstanding universal value to humanity and as such, have been inscribed on the World Heritage List to be protected for future generations to appreciate and enjoy”. But the question remains-how can a jungle in Africa, a Taj Mahal in India or the Acropolis of Athens be of significance to the entire world? The answer is that each world heritage sites is an important milestone in or manifestation of the astounding journey of mankind through the ages to the present day and is thus deemed to be of significance, to all the people of the world-irrespective of its physical location.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/city-heritage-cuts-across-national-temporal-boundaries/articleshow/82133165.cms||---
---||Dehradun||2.5 hectares forest cover gutted in three wildfire incidents within 24 hours in Uttarakhand; 20 villagers nabbed for starting blazes this month||DEHRADUN: Even as the precipitation in the higher reaches of Uttarakhand over the weekend brought some respite from forest fires, the hill state lost 2.5 hectares of forest cover to three wildfire incidents in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the forest department nabbed 20 villagers in the last fortnight for starting fires in the forests. “Rain spells have helped in reducing wildfires and our teams have been equally vigilant in not only dousing blazes but also in catching those who start it. In the past 17 days, we have nabbed 20 villagers across the state for causing forest fires. Cases against them have been registered under the Indian Forest Act of 1927,” said Rajiv Bhartari, head of forest force. The official added, “At least one dozen culprits were caught red-handed by our frontline patrolling teams. This shows that some people are acting irresponsibly.” TOI has learnt that cases have been registered against five people in the Narendra Nagar forest division, four people in Pauri, and three people in the Kedarnath Wildlife Division for starting wildfires. The cases of forest fires are under probe in several other divisions. According to official data, the state has witnessed 1,489 wildfire incidents in the past 17 days.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC toll 201, max deaths in waste management, health departments||MUMBAI: The Covid toll among BMC employees crossed the grim mark of 200 last week. The virus has claimed the lives of 201 BMC staffers and officials since March 2020 when the first wave hit the city. The families of only 67 staffers have received Rs 50 lakh from the BMC, while the kin of 62 employees have been given a job in the BMC. A total of 6,287 BMC staffers, including officers, have been infected by Covid-19 till now. Of these, 5,363 have recovered as on April 15. The highest deaths have been reported among employees in the solid waste management (SWM) department where 46 have died due to Covid, followed by the health department which has lost 38 employees. Last year, the civic body lost two senior officers to Covid. While deputy municipal commissioner Shirish Dixit, 55, died at his Mahim residence in June, hours after he tested positive for Covid-19, assistant municipal commissioner of H-east ward succumbed to the virus in July. BMC officials said requests for Rs 50 lakh compensation for the kin of 177 employees were sent to the Central government, but only 17 employees received compensation. BMC gave compensation to the remaining 50. In May last year, BMC had announced Rs 10 lakh compensation for its staff who succumbed to Covid-19. The amount was hiked following pressure from employee unions. BMC officials have been on the frontline in the fight against Coronavirus since March 11 last year when the first Covid-19 case was reported in Mumbai. “SWM and healthcare workers have been on duty even during the stringent lockdown last year. They have been collecting waste even from Covid hospitals. The health staff have been treating those infected, so these departments have the highest fatalities,” said a senior civic official. An official said the BMC first sends all applications of claims of staffers who died due to Covid to the Central government for compensation under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana. If the claims are rejected, the BMC gives Rs 50 lakh compensation and a job to a family member under its preferential treatment (PT) case scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-toll-201-max-deaths-in-waste-mgmt-health-depts/articleshow/82134877.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Their leave has been restricted to avoid their getting infected during travel and those joining duty after a leave will be kept in quarantine and then tested before being allowed to resume work. “We have created more isolation facilities in view of the surge. Except for urgent need, leave has been restricted. Those coming from leave to resume duties, will be isolated for five-six days and then undergo RT-PCR test — before being allowed to resume duty at the airport,” said a senior official of IGI airport. The official added that the focus was on maintaining high levels of cleanliness and to ensure proper cross ventilation in dormitories. “Office staffs have been located at three places to ensure there is no crowding at one place. While all this has been done so far during the ongoing surge, we will take more steps as the situation evolves,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cisf-restricts-leave-of-staff-at-igi-ramps-up-safety-efforts/articleshow/82134878.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Corbett bookings halved, hotels outside see over 90% cancellations||NAINITAL: The rising number of Covid-19 cases and restrictions on the movement of people has almost halved the bookings at the Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR). On Sunday, over 100 people visited the reserve while 51 opted for a night stay. The figures, however, are very low compared to the previous years in April and May — which is the peak tourist season in CTR. Speaking to TOI, the officials said that though the night bookings have fallen 50%, it is the day safaris which have been most affected. “Till April 4, we had a decent tourist footfall, however, since then the tourist numbers have been going down. In fact, the other day there was just one safari in a day. We are trying to assess the actual numbers and the impact of Covid restrictions will be known only then,” said Corbett director, Rahul. The hoteliers operating outside the Corbett said that their advance bookings have fallen by over 90%. “The hotels here are on the verge of bankruptcy. There is not a single hotel near Corbett which can claim that even a tenth of its rooms are booked. It is becoming increasingly difficult for us to survive,” said Hari Mann, Ramnagar’s hotels association president. The worst affected are the resorts which also have wedding venues. One of the hoteliers whose resort is located on the periphery of the CTR said that all the weddings scheduled for April and May have been cancelled. “The only booking that I still have is for November. We had almost a dozen bookings for April and May, and now, all of them have been cancelled,” he said. The Corbett administration is now planning to make RT-PCR negative certificates mandatory for entry into the reserve. “With the rise in the number of Covid cases we are worried about its spread in Corbett, therefore, we have had discussions with the stakeholders and Covid certificates will soon be made mandatory for tourists,” Rahul said. On the other hand, Mann said that the move will further damage the struggling tourism industry in the area. “We all depend on Corbett for our living. The mandatory Covid certificate will further restrict tourists from coming to Ramnagar, and ultimately, lead to many lost jobs in the area,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/corbett-bookings-halved-hotels-outside-see-over-90-cancellations/articleshow/82133174.cms||Prashant Jha

Over 15 bodies packed in transparent bags are lined up in a room at the civil hospital as they were allegedly not handed over to the family members. The Valsad hospital has 300 beds for indoor patients and 100 beds were added recently considering the increasing number of patients. All 400 beds are currently occupied and the district administration is now working to develop additional hospital facilities to accommodate more patients.  Valsad shares the border with worst-affected Maharashtra and the hospital gets critical patients from the rural areas of neighbouring Dang and Navsari districts too.  “I held a meeting with hospital and other officials to maintain all the protocols and ensure that no patient or their relatives have to suffer.

---||Delhi||Metro To Run At Reduced Frequency||New Delhi: This week, Delhi Metro will run trains at a frequency of half-an-hour during peak hours and one hour during off peak hours with only those exempted from the restrictions imposed under the week-long lockdown. There will also be fewer Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and Cluster Scheme buses on the road during this week. Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), said, in view of the lockdown, Metro services on the network would be available with a reduced headway (frequency). Delhi Metro’s train services will be available at a frequency of 30 minutes between 8am and 10am and again during the evening peak hour between 5pm and 7pm across the network. “For rest of the hours, services will be available with a frequency of 60 minutes only,” Dayal said. Metro services during this period can be availed only by the exempted category of people on production of valid IDs, he said. “Passengers only up to 50% seating capacity can travel in the Metro In addition, no standing passenger shall be allowed during the travel,” he added. For the entire lockdown period, “holiday schedule” will be operated — 75% buses of the total fleet will run in the morning shift and 60% in the evening, said RS Minhas, deputy chief general manager (Public Relations), DTC. An official of Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS), which operates the Cluster Scheme buses, said that during the lockdown, buses would operate on the cluster routes, but only 1,651 out of the total Cluster Scheme fleet of 2,990 would be deployed. The ridership during the weekend curfew was very low, and the schedule of deployment during the lockdown has been made keeping that in mind, he added. While passengers would be allowed to travel by Metro after verification of their valid IDs by DMRC or Central Industrial Security Force personnel, marshals and conductors would check IDs in buses. While full seating was allowed in public transport buses from November last year, and passengers could stand while keeping a six feet distance in Delhi Metro, the DDMA order issued on Monday reduced seating capacity to 50% and no standing passengers would be allowed in view of the alarming rise in Covid cases. Autorickshaws, e-rickshaws, cabs etc. can only transport two passengers at a time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/metro-to-run-at-reduced-frequency/articleshow/82152268.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

While some have temporarily suspended services for the public, others are restricting numbers. The shrine of Our Lady of Fatima at Don Bosco, Panaji, has announced that its popular Eucharistic adoration on Thursday would move online, with nobody allowed inside the shrine. It also suspended all evening Masses on weekdays and Sundays, and stated that some Masses would be held with limited participation, and others with no public at all. “These measures are taken for your own safety and the safety of our students, who will be appearing for their examinations,” the notice stated. The Pilar fathers, too, have requested people not to visit. “While Covid cases are increasing considerably and as Pilar houses many institutions, including a home for elderly priests, visitors and devotees will not be permitted to the Pilar hillock for any purpose till further notice,” said superior delegate Fr Nazareth Fernandes. “We request you to bear with us. We shall open as soon as the situation improves. Let us pray for each other that God may protect us all in these times,” he added. At Carmelite monastery in Margao, the faithful were informed that henceforth, only those who pre-register online or via telephone would be allowed for Sunday Mass. The number of attendees will also be reduced to 70. Confessions have been temporarily stopped, and parents were told that catechism for children would continue online. On Sunday, several churches sounded their faithful out about the dire situation and that other churches that have already suspended services. Many said they would take a decision in the coming days, on whether to continue services with a congregation. Priests also cautioned people not to go to Church if they have any symptoms of Covid. TOI reported on Sunday that the annual feast Mass of Our Lady of Miracles, popularly known as Milagres Saibinn, at St Jerome’s church, Mapusa, has been cancelled. The feast Mass, scheduled to be celebrated on April 19, was cancelled due to the rise in Covid-19 cases, parish priest Fr Dennis Fernandes said. TOI had earlier reported that the Mae de Deus church in Saligao was among the first to suspend services for the faithful as a precautionary measure, stating that “prevention is not waiting for bad things to happen, it’s preventing things from happening in the first place”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-cases-spike-some-churches-shut-some-services-go-online/articleshow/82134884.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Nagpur||Only 80 ind units submit self-certification, many more continue operations||Nagpur: The industries department has got undertakings regarding adherence to Covid norms from only 80 units in Nagpur district so far under the self-certification system for operating under current restrictions. However, there are reports that a higher number of industries are operating. Sources say this indicates that there may be gross under-reporting with a number of units continuing to operate without even submitting a self-certificate, which is mandatory under the current regime. During last year’s lockdown, as many as 4,800 units had submitted self-certification over a period of time, said sources. The demand for electricity, which is a major parameter to judge industrial activity, has also not gone down. As on Saturday, the power demand throughout the state remained in the range of 21,300 MW in the day to 19,240 MW in the night. Sunday’s figures will be available on Monday. The consumption is same as the pre-lockdown period, said sources in MSEDCL, the state government run power distribution company. The latest directives allow industries making essential products or their supporting units to operate at full capacity. The rest can operate with 50% workforce if there is arrangement for the workers to stay on the factory premises or at an isolated location close by under a bubble arrangement. The units can start operations after giving a self-certification about the nature of activities. Out of the 80 units that have submitted the undertaking, 20% have simply mentioned they are engaged in activities supporting an essential industry. There is no specific mention of the industry to which the unit is providing ancillary services, said a source. The essential industries include units engaged in pharmaceuticals, food, veterinary medicines, and agriculture input sectors. Such industries along with export oriented units can operate at full capacity. A number of industries, irrespective of their nature of activities, are openly operating without any undertaking regarding compliance of norms. This is despite online sessions being held in presence of district collector and commissioner of police to explain the directives clearly. Now it is up to the civic authorities to take action against the erring units, the source said. The matter has been taken up with the authorities. A number of units have also not returned their balance stock of oxygen cylinders to vendors so that it can be spared for hospital use. The administration has issued orders for all oxygen consuming industries like steel units to shut down. The managements were expected to return the cylinders lying with them immediately, an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/only-80-ind-units-submit-self-certification-many-more-continue-operations/articleshow/82133895.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Delhi||Delhi: RWAs gear up to do their part, but fret over lack of trained resources||NEW DELHI: With directions from lieutenant governor, the district administration has had a round of meetings with many Resident Welfare Associations to make arrangements for setting up health facilities at suitable sites. The administration will provide PPE Kits, oxygen cylinders, medicines and oximeters for Covid patients at these locations. While many RWAs agreed to help, provision for reliable critical care specialists and healthcare workers is their cause of concern. According to them, while doctors and healthcare workers living in the neighbourhood are coming forward to contribute, most of them are not ready for regular physical visits at the centres and prefer to give online consultation and counselling. “We are still hopeful and expect that things will be finalised in a day or two. We are consulting doctors and healthcare workers from nearby hospitals for visits on a consultation basis. We can’t run the facility unless we are confident about all factors,” said Sanjay Rana, GK-II RWA president. Rana said that the district magistrate for South East visited a site that may be converted to a small healthcare centre. “Many people in our colony have agreed to help with regular supply of food and material of day to day requirement,” he said. Residents of Shahpur Jat and Navjiwan Vihar also had meetings with the SDM on Sunday evening. “We zeroed in upon a site for starting a treatment centre. But since this is the matter of treatment and not just isolation, we need to execute the concept carefully after engaging doctors, nurses and paramedics. We have consulted some reliable critical-care specialists and are trying to work out a project concept in a day of two,” said Ruby Makhija secretary Navjiwan Vihar. “We have suggested government officials to also connect these centres with some tertiary hospitals for help in case of emergency.” Residents of Shahpur Jat also expressed willingness for making similar arrangements in the neighbourhood. “As a community, it is our responsibility to step forward and help each other. We are ready to extend all our support,” said Kuldeep Panwar, vice president, Grameen Ati Jeevan Society RWA. The RWA of Sainik Farm has already opened a Covid-care facility 14 days ago at a MCD primary school in Pushp Vihar III, which has 60 patients. Last year, too, they had operated the centre for six months after getting a nod from local administration and the councillor. Doctors, therapists, yoga activities are part of arrangements made by the RWA from their resources. The initiative aimed to help the domestic workers and their families who were facing problems in accessing hospitals. “But now due to rampant increase in numbers, we are serving on a first-come first-serve basis. There is pressure to increase the numbers of beds, but we need facilities accordingly too. As of now, if the situation of any person deteriorates then we are referring them to a government hospital,” said Hardeep Singh, president of Sainik Vihar RWA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rwas-gear-up-to-do-their-part-but-fret-over-lack-of-trained-resources/articleshow/82134907.cms||Vibha Sharma

The state’s positivity rate, too, rose to 29%. Goa’s weekly positivity rate, calculated over a seven-day period, was 24.2%, the second highest in the country. Last week, it was 5.17%. Meanwhile, active cases which were fewer than 500 a few weeks ago, soared past the 7,000-mark. Also, 105 people were hospitalised on Sunday. As the unrelenting second wave pushes on, chief minister Pramod Sawant said that the government is focusing on hospital management and testing and tracing. “We have increased testing facilities, and the number (of samples) has been crossing 3,000 each day,” he said. “By Tuesday, the number will go up to 5,000,” he told reporters in Margao. He also said that the state would receive additional stock of Remdesivir on Monday, and stated that there was no shortage in the state. “There’s no shortage of Remdesivir. There was only a small issue regarding oxygen, which we have resolved,” he stated, adding that oxygen supply to industries has been diverted for medical use. “There is sufficient availability of medical oxygen, and our infrastructure is equipped to handle the demands due to the rising Covid cases,” he said, adding that bed capacity is also being increased. Health minister Vishwajit Rane also said that there is no shortage of Remdesivir. “We have taken adequate measures to ensure there is sufficient inventory to treat patients,” he said, adding, “Every patient treated at government hospitals is our responsibility”. He also thanked Kerala health minister KK Shailaja for helping with the movement of 20,000 litres of liquid oxygen for Covid patients in Goa. Sawant also appealed to people to get tested and specifically asked those who are waiting for their results from RT-PCR tests to isolate themselves till they receive the results. “Don’t roam around and infect others,” he said. “Isolate until you receive the results.” Sunday’s 11 deaths, the highest in the second wave so far, took the death toll to 884. One patient, a 54-year-old from Ambaji, Margao, was ‘brought dead’ to Hospicio hospital, was found postmortem to have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to Covid-19.

To beat the heat at Nandurbar, the WR came out with two novel ideas. Firstly, it covered the roof of the coaches with layered gunnies and a water drip system to lower the temperature. Secondly, it affixed water coolers to windows of each coach and supported them on stands kept on the platform. “We did not have to send AC coaches as this new system has ensured that the coach is a comfortable isolation area for patients and it also has several facilities including mosquito nets, bio-toilets, power sockets and oxygen cylinders. Space has been created in these coaches to hold IV fluid bottles, extra bottle holders and clamps have been provided to hang them,” Thakur said. The railways have made available 21 coaches with Covid-care facility on platform 3 of Nandurbarstation and more patients are likely to be accommodated in a few days, Thakur said. “A modified coach has eight bays or ‘cabins’ with a maximum 16 beds,” he stated. A normal coach has a total 72 berths. Every train coach has three toilets — one western and two Indian style — and a bathroom with hand showers, buckets, mugs and bathroom stools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-20-patients-move-into-covid-care-train-coaches/articleshow/82134910.cms||Somit Sen
---||Chennai||Taking the justice movement forward||Fighting for workplace rights R Anbu Vendhan, 50,  union head for sanitation workers n 1996, when Vendhan was invited to his first protest by sanitary workers against an amended rule by the Chennai corporation to register complaints under the SC/ST Act, he couldn’t have guessed that event would define the course of his work. "They were protesting an amendment that required a worker to get permission from a superior to lodge a complaint under the SC/ST Act. I was a young social worker then, and this movement gave me a fresh glimpse into the complex issues sanitation workers faced – from wage discrimination to sexual harassment and caste-based discrimination at the workplace," says Vendhan, who realised the need for a union to address these issues. Under the guidance of Prakash Ambedkar, grandson of B R Ambedkar, he was nominated the state president of the Republican Trade Union of India in 2004. Since taking over, Vendhan has conducted extensive research, filed numerous RTIs and brought to light failures in the implementation of the terms and conditions laid down for the welfare of sanitation workers as suggested by the Supreme Court. He has exposed the condition of manual scavengers and has been pushing for widows of sanitary workers to get jobs that match their educational qualification. In 2006, after a woman sanitary worker was sexually harassed by a conservancy inspector, the union’s pressure and documentation of the struggle faced by women in the field pushed the National Commission for Women to form a sexual harassment cell in the Chennai corporation. Under his leadership in 2009, thousands of sanitary workers from the SC community got permanent job orders. Teaching the beats of change Sister Chandra, parai practitioner and activist mong Sister Angeline Chandra’s earliest memories is performing a vibrant ‘kolattam’ (a folk dance using sticks) on a beautiful Christmas day as her parents sang for her. She was five years old then. Chandra was raised by a social activist father who was loved by the village for his altruistic spirit and social consciousness. She decided to follow in her father’s footsteps, and in 1990, started the Sakthi Folk Cultural Centre in Dindigul to empower young dalit women by teaching them the ‘parai’, using it pedagogically, to help them reclaim not just the instrument that has become a symbol of protest against untouchability and oppression, but also express their identity through it. "Our team has members from all religions, and they use art, which is the only humanistic way to reach people across these differences," says Chandra. Since its inception, Sakthi’s girls have used native folk art forms as a campaign against gender, class and caste discrimination, and performed across Tamil Nadu, as well as the US, Japan and South Korea. They have also been using the ‘parai’ as a tool of reclamation and empowerment of young SC women in the village. Forcing open closed doors Ponniyah Kandasamy, 79,  ex-serviceman and anti-caste activist n the late 1980s, when Ponniyah completed his service as a mechanic with the Indian Army and returned to his village of Uthapuram in Madurai, little did he know that another long fight awaited him — one that would become a mission for life. Uthapuram is home to the infamous ‘caste wall’ and a village that has made it to the headlines for caste clashes between the dominant Pillais and the Scheduled Caste Devendrakula Velalars. Ponniyah, now 79, and a dalit man, has been at the forefront of the anti-caste movement for equal rights in Madurai, since 1989, when a 12-ft high, 600m-long wall of untouchability was erected, barring oppressed community members from entering the main road in his village. Among his victories in his fight for dignity was the Madurai high court order to open the Mutharamman Koil to dalits in 2008 and the construction of a common bus stand in 2007, which the dominant community had restricted, to avoid sharing seats with Devendrakula Velalar members. Today, years have passed and his grandchildren are studying abroad, but Ponniyah’s spirit remains undaunted. "I have always made it a point to put forward the demands of my community members, and continue to find my purpose in ensuring we get equal access to every facility — be it a road, water body or temple," he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/taking-the-justice-movement-forward/articleshow/82133912.cms||---

On Sunday, around 26 passengers were expected to deboard Dehradun Express at Vadodara railway station.  The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) had set up two RT-PCR booths at platform number one to collect samples of the passengers while railway officials made continuous announcements asking Kumbh returnees to undergo test. But sample of only one passenger – Rajesh Giri, a sevak of Hanuman temple at Chokhandi – was collected.  Interestingly, all other passengers said that they had returned from other destinations including Delhi and even Dahod.  “There were only two passengers from Haridwar. One had RT-PCR negative report while another did not have any and underwent test,” said Khemraj Meena, public relations officer of Vadodara railway division.  Meena claimed that the railway administration did trace details of other passengers which confirmed that only two of them had returned from Haridwar. The sample will be sent to GMERS Medical College and Hospital, Gotri.  Many are questioning the logic of the entire exercise given the fact that passengers from other destinations are not being asked to produce RTPCR negative report or neither their samples are being collected. Last month, the state government had issued a directive that all passengers coming from outside Gujarat should be tested at railway stations. Even as other municipal bodies like the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation had set up booths outside the railway stations to test such passengers, no such arrangement could be made at Vadodara railway station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/just-one-kumbh-returnee-takes-rt-pcr-in-vadodara/articleshow/82133209.cms||---
---||Nagpur||‘We must be two steps ahead of the virus, but we end up chasing it’||Dr Shishir Shrivastav, an alumnus of IGGMCH, was among the few critical care specialists of the 1990s in the city. After the pandemic started, Dr Shrivastav has treated over 1,000 Covid patients since the August-September first wave peak at his DCH. In this interview with TOI, he shares insights on Covid management, various crises and challenges. Excerpts... What is your opinion on the second wave of Covid? This time it’s more infectious and more deadly as it is a mutant strain. Because it adapts or modifies itself to stay in a habitat so that it can survive longer and replicate more. People have become relaxed about Covid-appropriate behavior and behave as if corona is no more in existence. What are the burning issues while treating Covid patients? Lack of essential drugs like Remdesivir, Itolizumeb, Tocilizumeb and oxygen. Shortage of skilled healthcare personnel are the most acute issues. The number of beds and ventilators are inadequate to meet the demands of the large number of patients requiring them. Also, hundreds of distressed calls, exhausted and overworked staff and the discomfort of wearing PPEs in the hot climate increase stress levels. Then there is the fear of mass casualty due to lack of oxygen. All this is taking a toll on the mental health of the hospital staff. Adding to the woes is the big worry of family members of healthcare workers getting infected. Why is there so much of chaos and panic regarding the shortage of Remdesivir? I receive continuous phone calls regarding admission of Covid patients and I also get numerous calls enquiring about the availability of Remdesevir. I’m also getting patients who have taken 2 or 3 injections of Remdesivir at an exorbitant cost in desperation because they feel that this is the only drug which can save their life. I would like to state that no doubt Remdesevir is very useful as it reduces the viral load and also reduces the hospital stay but it is not a panacea for Covid. There are many factors at play. Studies conducted so far do not indicate that it has any mortality benefits. Therefore I appeal to people at large to not panic and buy Remdesivir indiscriminately and hoard it. There are other drugs too which are given to Covid patients and that Ramdesivir is the only drug is a myth. What should be the approach in dealing with such Covid waves? We should be two steps ahead of the virus by following strict norms of social distancing and hand hygiene practices. The government machinery as well as the healthcare industry should also be alert and in a state of preparedness for the abrupt rise of cases by increasing the infrastructure and manpower. Unfortunately, we believe in chasing the virus after the wave is on us with a vengeance due to which there is chaos all-round. As a doctor and hospital administrator, what kind of problems are you facing? Patients are of the younger generation. With more fulminant virus strain, they are deteriorating fast. There are many patients who require a high flow of oxygen and ventilators. Managing all hospitalised patients and making beds available for the ones who are in great distress is a herculean task where you have to triage the patients on merit basis. Relatives of patients need virtual counselling and sometimes, a one-to-one session. The cost of treatment goes up when a patient needs high-end modalities and medicines but unfortunately many of the needy patients can’t afford it. How has Covid affected the people of Nagpur? Covid has affected the social, physical, mental and economic health of our society. Many with non-Covid illnesses are unable to get treatment. The elderly and children are unable to enjoy social freedom and it affects them adversely. Many have died untimely leaving behind devastated family and friends. It seems like a battle with no end in sight if timely intervention with a proper strategy of rapid vaccination and strict distancing and hand washing are not implemented. What kind of suggestions would you like to give people? Physical distancing, don’t be a part of gatherings, avoid unnecessary outings, spend more time with your family, don’t obsess over Covid news, don’t create panic in your circle. Fight Covid by following strict protocols. Is there any way by which the demand for beds can be reduced? One way to utilize the bed optimally is to give early discharge as soon as the patient shows signs of improvement and needs only about 2 to 3 litres of oxygen. This may be achieved by using home oxygen concentrators or oxygen cylinders. Unfortunately, both are in short supply and thus we cannot discharge patients who could otherwise easily be managed at home and free up the bed capacity for more critical patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/we-must-be-two-steps-ahead-of-the-virus-but-we-end-up-chasing-it/articleshow/82133930.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Goa||India’s most feared||Whenever he took the field, Anthony Rebello played like someone possessed, sparing nobody, not even his closest friends, if they were at the opposite end. “You know, Armando (Colaco) is among my close friends, but whenever Salgaocar played Dempo, he was just another opponent for me. If he was an obstacle in my team’s path to success, I didn’t hesitate to tackle,” admits Rebello, who hails from Curtorim. Once the referee blew the final whistle, the rock-solid defender would himself go to the other end, shake hands with the players and forget everything that happened on the field just minutes ago. For those who were at the receiving end of his defending, it wasn’t easy. “Players feared him,” says Brahmanand Shankhwalkar, Goa’s first Arjuna Award winner. “Rebello was a well-built defender who had a commanding presence in the air. He seemed to reserve his best for the Bengal teams.” Since joining Salgaocar Sports Club, Rebello’s fame of being a tough as nails defender travelled quickly beyond Goan shores. Nigerian striker Chima Okorie, among India’s better-known foreign imports, was in awe of him. Others had no choice. As former footballer Irineu Gonsalves noted in one of his posts on social media, it wasn’t uncommon to see outstation players walk up to the defender before kick off and tell him “Anthony bhai, humko sambalo”. “There were players who jokingly caught my feet,” says Rebello, singling out Dempo striker Dionisio Trindade for praise as the striker who never feared him and Nicholas Pereira for his allround abilities.  As a youngster , Rebello admits he was skinny with “bones and little flesh”. He then did well to turn himself into a burlybuilt defender with strong shoulders. He was tough in every sense of the word. “While in school at St Xavier’s (in Curtorim), the principal Honorato Velho believed in my ability. He gave me permission to leave class after the fourth period and attend Panvel SC training. He gave me Rs 10 every day to travel.” Before Rebello could make his debut for Panvel – who famously won the Bandodkar Gold Trophy in 1974 – the club shut shop. It was Alex Mascarenhas who took him to Mandovi Shipyard SC in the senior division. Three years later, Salgaocar came calling. The early-morning knock happened on the day he was packing his bags to travel to Mumbai and join Central Railway. The faces at the door were familiar: Henrique Britto and Leopold Fernandes. The Salgaocar stalwarts wanted him to do duty for the club at Madurai. Once he travelled for the tournament, there was no looking back. “Salgaocar fielded me in their first 11 for the Madurai tour (in Tamil Nadu). I did well and the club then asked me to join them permanently. Once I signed, I never felt like joining any other club, whatever maybe the offer,” he says. That was in 1977. For the next 10 years, Rebello came up with top-notch performances for Salgaocar, playing in central defence alongside Oscar Rebello, Derrick Pereira and Norbert Gonsalves. He was also an integral part of the Goa squad that won the National Football Championship for the Santosh Trophy in 1984, crucially without conceding a goal. Part of that credit should go to coach T Shanmugham, who not just polished his game at the club but also handled him well, using both the carrot and stick. Rebello’s performances caught the eye of national selectors in 1982 as they rewarded him with a place in the India squad for the President’s Cup in Seoul and later Merdeka Cup in Malaysia. The defender, however, lost out on a cherished spot for Asian Games at the last moment. “The reputation of being a tough defender grew over the years,” says Rebello. “When I was in top form, we started enjoying an edge over Bengal powerhouses like Mohun Bagan, East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting. We started defeating them, unlike in the past when Goan teams gave up even before the match kicked off.” Rebello, now 64, was most dangerous during set-pieces. If Salgaocar had to defend a corner, his presence was enough to scare away opponents. If he went up for the header, nobody challenged. “Sometimes I got to score easy goals from headers during free-kicks or corner kicks because nobody used to mark me,” says Rebello, also known for his powerful long-rangers. He scored plenty of goals. It was his trademark header – five minutes from the final whistle – that helped Salgaocar edge out Punjab Police and win the Nehru Cup in 1985 in Hyderabad. He also notched the match-winner against East Bengal in the 1985 Bordoloi Trophy. A knee injury forced Rebello into an early retirement in 1987. After working with Salgaocars for a couple of years, he sought pastures greener in Kuwait. Here, he continued to play and coach teams like Curtorim Gymkhana and Curtorim United, winning plenty of trophies. Rebello is now back home after 22 years in Kuwait. He looks back at his career with fondness. If only his knee had not given way, he could have achieved much more.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/indias-most-feared/articleshow/82134920.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Goa||Gathering of over 50 people? Get state nod||Panaji: Aimed at curbing the spread of Covid, the state government on Sunday issued orders imposing restriction on gatherings of more than 50 people and has made it mandatory for organisers to seek permission from the sub-district magistrate. Both the organiser as well as the venue-in charge will be penalised as per law, the order said. However, central and state government functions have been exempted from nods. In the order, both the district collectors have stated that a fresh surge in Covid-19 cases is being witnessed in Goa as well as some parts of the country, and the situation might further aggravate due to religious, sports, entertainment, educational, cultural or any other form of gatherings and to contain the spread of the pandemic, certain measures are required to be taken. “In my considered opinion, there is sufficient grounds for proceeding under sub-section (1) of Section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure,1973, to take preventive steps to contain the spread of the virus,” the order read. Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Friday had said that the collectors will issue necessary orders to put restrictions on gatherings in indoor and outdoor areas. Other statutory permissions have to be sought by the applicants in addition to this permission, the collectors said. The organiser, as well as the venue in-charge, will be held responsible for any violation of this order and need to ensure that wearing of masks, social distancing norms and other Covid appropriate behaviours are followed, the order stated. “Any violations will be liable for action as per the provision of Section 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, besides legal action under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code,” both collectors stated in their orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gathering-of-over-50-people-get-state-nod/articleshow/82134904.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Twin cities epicentre of second Covid wave in Telangana||HYDERABAD: The twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad are the epicentre of the second wave of Covid-19, health minister Eatala Rajender said on Sunday. Rajender said that at least 50% of the 37,000-plus active cases in the second wave have been reported from the twin cities. In the current wave, the intensity of the infection was increasing rapidly and condition of patients was worsening within 2-3 days as against the earlier 10-12 days during the first wave, the minister said. The minister stressed on vaccinating anyone above 25 years and said now the state can vaccinate 10 lakh people per day, but the entire process had been stalled due to shortage in supplies. Telangana has appealed to the central government to address the shortage of the vaccine, the minister said. “I have spoken to the central government officials to increase vaccine supply. We have also urged the Union health minister to allow vaccination for those above 25 years. He is yet to respond,” the minister said. Rajender said there was no shortage of beds in government hospitals and 60,000 beds were available across the state. “I have urged doctors and nurses not to take leaves,” he added. “While the number of cases is increasing by thousands, the number of serious cases are low. Even MBBS doctors are qualified to treat these cases. Also, our officials are in constant consultation with the central government on the issue of oxygen shortage in the state. Oxygen production is a subject of the central government and at present the states cannot produce oxygen. Currently, Telangana requires 250 tonnes of oxygen per day, but the requirement can shoot up to 350 tonnes if cases increase at the current rate,” the minister said, adding that doctors have been advised to use oxygen judiciously and not give it to satisfy patients’ anxiety. The health department has suggested reducing oxygen supply for industrial needs so they can be provided to hospitals for now. Pertaining to the shortage of antiviral drug Remdesivir, the minister said that the drug was sent to all public and private hospitals. “The manufacturing companies said they had reduced manufacturing the drug due to lack of demand as corona cases have been declining for the past four months. We are likely to get 3 lakh injections soon if the Centre changes some protocols,” he added. Allaying fears of virus being airborne, the minister reiterated that self-imposed lockdown, wearing masks and other Covid-appropriate behaviour was the only way to protect one from the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/twin-cities-epicentre-of-second-covid-wave-in-t/articleshow/82135419.cms||Amrita Didyala

---||Ahmedabad||Court fines photographer||Ahmedabad: A consumer court in Surendranagar district has ordered a photographer to pay Rs 11,000 compensation to his client for failing to give her a photograph album after taking contract to shoot her betrothal ceremony. The case involved Devani Gohil (26) from Surendranagar town. Her engagement ceremony was scheduled on January 26, 2020. She contacted a wedding photographer in the town, Saumil Dodiya, who was paid Rs 13,500 in advance and he agreed to shoot the betrothal ceremony. Dodiya shot the betrothal ceremony and promised Gohil that he would prepare an album of the photographs and hand it over to her in next four days. But he did not turn up and never gave her the photographs of her engagement ceremony. According to Gohil’s complaint before the Surendranagar District Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, the photographer even stopped responding to her queries regarding the photographs and album. After much persistence on part of the client, the photographer agreed to refund the charges but did not give the photographs. He issued a cheque in November towards refund, but the cheque bounced twice due to insufficient fund in bank account. The woman sued the photographer for deficiency in service and unfair trade practice. She demanded compensation for the mental harassment caused due to Dodiya’s unprofessional behaviour and also for the loss of reputation. Despite summons issued to him, the photographer did not appear before the consumer court. After hearing the case, the court concluded that since the fee for the photography project was paid in advance, the woman was the consumer and the photographer was liable to refund and compensate for the difficulties caused to the consumer. The photographer has been ordered to refund Rs 13,500 with 7% interest and to pay Rs 11,000 extra towards compensation for mental harassment, for loss of reputation and legal expenditure that his client had to incur on this litigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/court-fines-photographer/articleshow/82134908.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi government asks cops to file FIR against 4 airlines for flouting RT-PCR norms||NEW DELHI: The Arvind Kejriwal government on Sunday asked Delhi Police to lodge an FIR against four airlines — IndiGo, Vistara, SpiceJet and AirAsia India — for flouting the rule of flying in people from Maharashtra to the capital with negative RT-PCR report. Airlines, on their part, said they adhere to all norms and had not received any FIR till Sunday evening. “…it has been observed that a large number of passengers fly from Maharashtra to Delhi without a valid RT-PCR report…. written to SHO of IGI Airport to lodge FIRs against four flights (possibly one each by) Indigo, Spice Jet, Vistara and Air Asia… for carrying passengers from Maharashtra without valid RT-PCR tests,” Delhi government said in a statement Sunday. This action has been sought under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. Delhi requires people flying in from Maharashtra to have a negative RT-PCR report from a test done within 72 hours of departure, and those coming without the same must remain in quarantine for 14 days. Various states have different entry requirements in terms of RT-PCR test reports and quarantine for those coming from other states. An IndiGo spokesperson said the airline has not “received any FIR against it…” AirAsia India said in a statement it is in “compliance with guidelines and protocols issued by the respective regulatory bodies… we have not received any information from any authority on this matter (FIR).” Comments from Vistara and SpiceJet are awaited. In this ever-evolving pandemic situation, airlines have had their own issues with RT-PCR test reports. In the past few months, there have been many instances of airlines globally being barred from flying to certain places for bringing in passengers with negative reports who test positive on arrival. This has happened with Indian carriers too in places like UAE and Hong Kong. Tamil Nadu had barred a UAE budget carrier from flying in passengers for some days after a person flew in with a negative report but was actually positive. Since RT-PCR tests need to be undertaken 3-4 days before departure, there is a possibility of passengers getting infected sometime after giving nasal swab samples. This discrepancy pin test report and actual Covid status was found to be very high with reports from certain labs in India. After that UAE, for instance, barred airlines from flying in people from India with reports from some labs here. The Emirates website says “If you are flying from India, Pakistan, Nigeria or Bangladesh, you must get your certificate from one of the labs listed in the designated laboratories document to be accepted on the flight (to Dubai).” An airline official said: “We have given strict instructions to check-in staff to follow entry requirements of all states. If someone gives a forged test report or if someone with a negative report tests positive on arrival, what can we do? Airlines are struggling to survive and the last thing we want to do is wilfully defy rules and run foul of the law also.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-asks-cops-to-file-fir-against-4-airlines-for-flouting-rt-pcr-norms/articleshow/82134922.cms||Saurabh Sinha

---||Nagpur||Plasma demand up but Covid fear, doubts deter donors||Nagpur: Shreenath, a first-year MBBS student at Panjabrao Deshmukh Medical College at Amravati, last Saturday travelled to Nagpur after he received a call for convalescent plasma donation. A recovered Covid patient, 18-year-old Shreenath is probably one of the youngest plasma donors in the region. On learning about his plan, Shreenath’s father Prafulla Sabale too joined him and offered to donate plasma. Sabale, who is Nagpur University director of examinations and evaluation board, had been vaccinated recently and hence couldn’t donate his plasma. “We realized there is shortage of plasma though it can help save lives,” said Sabale, who is also a professor of pharmaceutical sciences. While effectiveness of plasma remains a debatable issue, Covid hospitals are widely prescribing it as an alternative therapy for moderate to severe patients in Nagpur. However, the doubts, different medical opinions and ICMR’s disclaimer seem to have deterred citizens from bleeding to save lives. Blood banks say while the rush of patients is going up, there is acute shortage of donors. Dr Mohan Nerker, one of the directors of Seven Star Hospital, said they have not used plasma so far. “Anyways, it should be used within seven days of symptoms. After 9 days, virus replication is over while plasma is used as an anti-viral. Also, receptor binding domain (RBD) plasma, which has antibody titre 1/640, is effective. Studies have shown plasma doesn’t work once virus manifestation is severe, and there is no mortality benefit. There is also risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI),” he said. KRIMS director and pulmonologist Dr Ashok Arbat said they used to give plasma but didn’t get good results. “Personally, I feel it is not of much use. There are different views but overall there is no standard treatment protocol,” he said. Satyam Singh, public relations officer at Arpan Blood Bank, which is sponsored by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), said people are not convinced to donate. “When we call them up, they say they fear getting infected again, and going through same problems. This fear psychosis has affected blood donations too,” he said. Singh added that the demand for convalescent plasma is huge and many doctors are using remdesivir as well as plasma therapy. “Since the remdesivir injection is not available, doctors are most probably prescribing convalescent plasma,” he said. As per earlier guidelines, a recovered patient can donate plasma after 28 days of infection. A screening for antibody is done, followed by checking saturation, pulse, BP, temperature. “Only if the donor is healthy, the plasma is taken,” Singh said. Infectious disease specialist Dr Ashwini Tayade too said people are afraid of getting exposed. But she said, “It is a misconception that it works, there is no supporting scientific data.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/plasma-demand-up-but-covid-fear-doubts-deter-donors/articleshow/82133942.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh: Kin of dead forced to wait for hours as bodies pile up at crematorium||AGRA: The trees and streets leading to crematoriums in Agra and Moradabad were covered in grey ash and soot on Sunday. A long queue of ambulances crawled for hours, one after another, and sped away after unloading the dead. The dead then waited for hours before making it to the pyre. According to the caretakers of Agra’s Tajganj crematorium, the number of bodies reaching for cremation has jumped by five fold in the last 24 hours. Since Saturday afternoon, 70 bodies were consigned to flames. Earlier, 15 bodies used to be cremated everyday on an average. Now the waiting time was over five hours. Meanwhile, the health department officials confirmed that four Covid-19 patients have succumbed in the last 24 hours. A caretaker of Tajganj crematorium said, “There has been a five time increase in the number of dead bodies reaching for cremation. In the last 24 hours, we have done 30 electric cremations and have lit 35 wood pyres. We have asked the family members of the deceased to wait as vacant space is not available for cremation.” A worker at an electric crematorium at Tajganj said, “We have four furnaces. One dead takes around 75 minutes. Machine is getting overheated, and we have to stop in between. I have not seen so many dead bodies reaching in one day.” Family members of deceased are not being allowed to enter inside the cremation area. Standing over 50-meter away, people were seen crying and sobbing. Usually, cremations are not conducted after sunset. But for the last three days, dead bodies are being cremated round the clock. Tajganj crematorium in-charge, Sanjeev Gupta said, “Following increase in number of dead bodies, district administration has ordered that the cremation should continue day and night.” Shahganj resident Shivendra Verma said, “My father had breathing problems two days ago. We were not able to get a bed in the hospital. He died at home today morning. We are waiting for cremation for the last two hours. Caretakers suggest that vacant space is not available, and we may have to wait for another 3-4 hours.” While in Moradabad, families were spotted struggling to get their loved ones cremated. Authorities at Moksha Dham cremation ground in Moradabad said that on Saturday, a total of 14 bodies arrived. Of which nine had succumbed to the infection of Covid-19. Crematorium authorities said that it has happened for the first time that all crematorium platforms were occupied simultaneously. “The crematorium has a total of 15 platforms for pyre. I don’t remember the last time when all the platforms were occupied with pyres lit at the same time. It is a terrifying view,” said manager at the crematorium, Sanjay. According to information from the health department, as many as 17 people died of Covid-19 at two Covid-19 care facilities in Moradabad on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/kin-of-dead-forced-to-wait-for-hours-as-bodies-pile-up-at-crematorium/articleshow/82133939.cms||Deepak Lavania

These teachers, who have been working relentlessly in the fight against coronavirus pandemic, are in need of a break from this hectic duty, according to a letter written by an association of AMC teachers to education secretary Vinod Rao recently. “These teachers have not been rotated for about a year now. The government should give them some relaxation,” the letter by Ahmedabad Municipal Teachers’ Association said. L D Desai, administrative officer of AMC municipal school board claimed that there were currently only 100 teachers engaged in Covid-19 duty. There are 3,500 school teachers in various school boards under the corporation, of which 80% are women. They have been given various duties including health surveys, food coupon distribution and work in municipality hospitals, among others. A total of 500 teachers are posted at Covid-19 health centres in Ahmedabad where they are working at the health desk. Sixty-five teachers have been given duties at the Arogya Bhavan while 300 are posted at vaccination centres. The remaining 200-odd teachers of 1,100 have been given other Covid-19 duties, according to the association letter. “Presently, 50% of the AMC officials are working from home. The corporation can engage these employees for Covid-19 duty while giving the teachers a break,” said a member of the association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-teachers-seek-covid-duty-break/articleshow/82133947.cms||---

Agarwal had sought bail for 30 days and she told the court that she is seven-month pregnant and she required rest and medical check-up with private hospital. She submitted that ever since her arrest, she has not enjoyed temporary bail. The court did not grant her application and said that while refusing regular bail to her two months ago, the court had given direction to the jail authority to provide all medical facilities to her according to the rules and regulations of the jail manual. The court said that her pregnancy is not a ground tenable enough to release her on bail. Moreover, Agarwal did not submit medical papers or medical certificate showing any critical condition of hers, the court noticed in its order. Two months ago, while refusing regular bail to Agarwal for killing her mother-in-law Rekhaben, the court had observed, “Every woman expects a wonderful relationship with her in-laws. Respect is the base of any relationship.” The court had further said that the accused is highly educated and holds an MBA degree, “but, prima facie, it appears that she has completely failed to maintain her relationship with her mother-in-law and facing serious charges of killing her in a brutal manner…”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/woman-refused-bail-on-grounds-of-pregnancy/articleshow/82134917.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||How 5G & Blockchain will make your e-transactions quicker, safer||Today, when you book your flight ticket on a portal, it prompts you to buy travel insurance for a nominal amount. But claiming the insurance amount in case of a flight delay can be fraught with hassles. What if there was a smart and trustworthy system that could ensure that your claim amount got automatically credited to your digital wallet or bank account within minutes of your flight being delayed, without you having to go through the hassle of chasing the travel portal or insurance company? Soon this may be a reality with the country’s apex banking technology research organisation, Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT), working on building next-generation financial infrastructure that includes `smart contracts’, which will boost trust quotient in digital transactions. So how will this nextgen financial infrastructure look like? At the bottom of the next-level financial infrastructure will be a high-speed network powered by 5G/Edge Cloud that will boost speed and bandwidth capabilities, explained Prof D Janakiram, director of the Hyderabad-based IDRBT. This network will enable higher transaction speeds as well as AR/VR (augmented reality/virtual reality) capabilities to enable virtual banking, something that 4G networks are not able to support efficiently. With 5G, minimum latency can be reduced to one millisecond as compared to 50 milliseconds in 4G and data speeds can be around 10-20x faster than our existing 4G networks. Then, sitting on top of this high-speed 5G network, there will be ‘Smart Contracts’ that will be powered by the distributed ledger technology or Blockchain as it is more popularly known. To put it simply, with smart contracts, a financial agreement between two parties will get executed automatically when all the predetermined conditions are satisfied. This not only saves time but also ensures that ‘contracts’ are fulfilled. These ‘Smart Contracts’ will boost trust in digital transactions, similar to the manner in which we trust cash transactions, by enforcing the fulfilment of the agreed upon financial contract or transaction. He pointed out that in future, financial infrastructure will be equipped to support both digital marketplaces and digital payments in a trusted environment. "We will be able to trade all digital assets in a trusted manner in the future using this next-gen infrastructure," he said. Even as IDRBT is working on building the infrastructure for smart contracts, it is also trying to understand the kind of attacks that can target Blockchain systems. "There is a possibility of block withholding attack in which a block of transaction is not published. So, we’re looking at how to build a secure digital ledger platform that will ensure a trustworthy environment," he said. BANKING ON FUTURE With the rise in digitisation in banking activities, the incidents of cyber frauds too have spiked. While Blockchain is deemed to be tamper proof, even the best of technologies need to be fortified when it comes to banking systems to maintain people’s confidence and trust in the system. How safe is Blockchain? Blockchain is safer than existing centralised ledger technologies since they can withstand, among other attacks, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. In DDoS, the cyber criminals try to flood websites with too much traffic due to which it crashes or is unable to serve its actual users. What kind of threats can it face? Blockchain can face other kinds of attacks such as ‘51% attack’, when the majority of the nodes in the distributed system are compromised. This is a rare possibility though. How can Blockchain be made more secure? Permissioned blockchain systems, where there is control on who can be part of the blockchain system, is a much safer way of building blockchain applications. How can 5G make banking secure? Advanced algorithms that require quicker analysis of transaction data, including merchant ID, transaction amount, geolocation, biometrics and behavioural data (customer traits), can be executed at lower latency speeds thereby making the payment authentications quicker, faster and more secure with 5G.” -- Akhilesh Tuteja, partner & digital consulting, KPMG India||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/how-5g-blockchain-will-make-your-e-transactions-quicker-safer/articleshow/82133935.cms||Swati Rathor

All India Motor Transport Congress chairman (core committee) Bal Malkit Singh said that the government has also exempted the registration of permits for all tankers moving inter-state and carrying medical oxygen. “The government has also allowed nitrogen tankers to be converted to oxygen tankers to overcome the potential shortage of tankers,” he said, adding that this will now ensure tankers move round the clock and there is no short supply of medical oxygen at hospitals. The drivers will be working in shifts to ensure faster turnaround and adequate capacity to meet the surge in demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/govt-allows-free-movement-of-tankers-carrying-oxygen-in-maharashtra/articleshow/82134925.cms||Somit Sen
---||Udaipur||Remdesivir shortage in Udaipur too||JODHPUR: Shortage of remdesivir injections and delay in reports of samples have turned out to be two major causes of concern in the fight against the Covid. Despite consistent sounding of its concern, both these aspects remain beyond control of the administration. Patients requiring remdesivir are compelled to run from pillar to post to arrange the injection for their kin due to reluctance of hospital administrations to provide them citing no availability. Sunil, a relative of a patient admitted in the Covid ward in MG Hospital here, had this bitter experience on Sunday, when he was asked by the medical team to arrange remdesivir. He ran from pillar to post to arrange the injections in the market. When he could not manage, he made some calls to ‘influential’ people and found the hospital administration agreeing to make the same available to the patient. While remdesivir continue to play destiny game for the patients, delay in reports of tests are critically adding to surge in positive cases and delay in treatment as well delay in disposal of suspected bodies. Raj Parihar (55), a school teacher, had given her sample at Chopasni UPHC on April 12 after noticing symptoms. But she received a report on the night of April 15, while the medication started the next day afternoon, when a medical team visited her to provide the medicines. “By this crucial time, she visited her school and was continuously attended to by me. Now I also have given my sample and keeping my fingers crossed for the last three days,” said her son Saurabh. At a meeting with the stakeholders, divisional commissioner Rajesh Sharma also expressed concern over delay in release of reports terming it to be a cause of delay in treatment of the positive person and spread of infection. District magistrate Indrajit Singh said the issue of delay in sample reports pertained to SN Medical College computer operators, which has now been dealt with, while admitting the shortage of remdesivir injections. “The shortage will be resolved in two days hopefully. But even though, we need to use remdesivir judiciously both by patients and also the medical staff,” Singh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/remdesivir-shortage-in-udaipur-too/articleshow/82133937.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Mutant variant with increased infectivity circulating in Rajasthan, say doctors||JAIPUR: Behind the sudden surge in Covid cases, health experts suspect mutant variants are circulating and responsible for faster spread of the virus. In the state, cases have been reported in which infection has been found bypassing already present antibodies through infection or vaccination. Recently, the Centre’s SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG), a network of 10 laboratories, had conducted an analysis of samples from Maharashtra, which revealed that compared to December 2020, there has been an increase in the fraction of samples with the E484Q and L452R mutations. Such mutations confer immune escape and increased infectivity. However, Sawai Man Singh Medical College has denied any such mutation in state saying it was not documented yet, but confirmed that double mutant strain had been found in the country. “Double mutation is not documented in the state,” Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College and head of panel for Covid treatment said. He specifically pointed out there are a lot of differences in both the waves. “Second wave is more aggressive than the first and it is targeting all age groups especially young population. In the first wave, it was seen more in above 60 people. Also, in second wave, patients are detected with short history of developing pneumonia requiring oxygen. After infection of one person in a family, whole family gets infected and in 30-40% of cases, RTPCR tests negative but in some time such patients get severe pneumonia,” said Dr Bhandari, adding that those who have vaccinated, have also tested positive. But, they did not develop severe illness. City’s doctors believe that the mutant virus is of particular concern because it has more ability to spread, cause severe Covid pneumonia and skips the bodies immune system. “The possible mutation could be the reason for second wave of infection we are facing. There have been cases of reinfection which have been quite severe despite previous infection. The second wave we have encountered more severe disease in younger population,” said Dr Sheetu Singh, director (Covid pulmonary rehab) at a private hospital. The current surge is being mainly due to home-grown mutant variants of SARS COV-2, doctors suspect. “The strain is highly contagious and the rate of infection is much higher than before and causing more infection in younger persons. Since a large number of population is being affected, fatality numbers and the number of severe cases are expected to surge with the spike,” said Dr KK Sharma, senior consultant (pulmonology), at a private hospital. Doctors at government hospitals are also suspecting a new strain behind rise in cases. “With increasing number of cases in a short span of time, it seems that strain circulating is more transmissible than in first wave. Covid pneumonia is being observed more even in mildly symptomatic patients now which was quiet uncommon during first wave,” said Dr Shalini Rathore, incharge Covid at Mahila Chikitsalaya. Doctors say they have seen a change in symptoms in the second wave. “With the advent of new strain, we are seeing a new set of symptoms including upset stomach, aches, vomiting, conjunctivitis and others,” Dr Charu Sukhlecha, consultant, critical care at a private hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mutant-variant-with-increased-infectivity-circulating-in-state-say-docs/articleshow/82133944.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Focus on Covid, not rallies: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot to PM Narendra Modi||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has asked PM Narendra Modi to leave all political activities and rallies (election campaigning) to focus on the fight against Covid, which has entered a dangerous stage. In an interview to a news channel on Sunday, Gehlot said just like the way Modi had talked to chief ministers during the first wave, he should talk to them again on how the Centre can help states. “I have written to Modi requesting him to stop rallies and focus on Covid,” said Gehlot. While calling for immediate action, he said confidence of people had been shaken following reports showing shortage of oxygen and medicines. Blaming the Union government for making some mistakes in handling Covid, Gehlot said Rahul Gandhi in February 2020 had alerted on the effects of the pandemic, which was not heard. “But despite the conflict between the states and the Centre, the two have worked together for 13 months,” said Gehlot. Taking on Union health minister Harshvardhan Singh, Gehlot said he had considered him a nice man and never believed that he could lie. “They are not supplying vaccines to the states from the last 18-20 days and 8-10 states are crying over the supply of it be it Punjab or other states. When we were left with 1.5 days of vaccines and our vaccines centres were closing down, we alerted the Centre. Neither we complained nor alleged them of not providing the vaccines,” said Gehlot. Oxygen supply CM Ashok Gehlot has accused the Union government of discriminatory treatment is supplying oxygen to the state. He said since cases increased, oxygen supply had been hit. The issue was informed to the Union home secretary through our chief secretary. “Our oxygen plant has been taken over by the Union government in a larger fight against Covid. The Centre informed states that oxygen will be supplied to them on need basis. However, it is learnt that MP and UP have been provided oxygen, but not to Rajasthan,” said Gehlot. The matter was discussed during the Cabinet meeting and conveyed to the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/focus-on-covid-not-rallies-cm-to-pm/articleshow/82133934.cms||---

Of the 27 injured, one person is critical, police said. Thirty-three workers, belonging to Odisha and Chhattisgarh and who work at a local brick kiln in Sulthanpalli near Shamshabad, got into a lorry and went to a local vegetable market earlier in the day. Around 5.30 pm, the workers started their return journey. Police said that while trying to avoid the collision, the lorry driver lost control and the lorry fell to a side at high speed. Three persons — K Suna, 40, Gopal Deep, 45, and Kala Kumar,25, who were standing on the rear side of the lorry —fell out of the vehicle and were run over by the car. They died on the spot. Some persons were caught underneath the lorry. When the rescue operation was completed, four persons were still alive. They were immediately shifted to hospital. Within a few hours, three persons— Sahadar of Odisha, Hasthu and Paramanand of Chhattisgarh — succumbed. All the other persons in the lorry escaped with simple injuries. “The accident took place on a single road. The driver was not supposed to take humans in the lorry. It’s a crime,’’ deputy commissioner of police (Shamshabad zone) N Prakash Reddy told TOI. A case was registered under the Section 304-A (causing death by negligence) of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/6-workers-die-27-hurt-as-lorry-flips-in-bid-to-avoid-collision/articleshow/82135420.cms||---

---||Delhi||Not Untouched By Surge, District Courts See Case Count At A High||New Delhi: Covid cases in Delhi’s subordinate judiciary have seen an exponential rise in the past few weeks, with over 30 judges either testing positive or isolating themselves and over 60 staffers having found infected across districts. The surge in novel coronavirus infection numbers, which are available on Delhi district courts’ website, is at an all-time high. The data revealed that 32 judicial officers from seven districts have been either Covid-positive or in isolation, and 61 staffers in six district court complexes infected. The onset of the pandemic in 2020 affected judicial work, which was moved from physical to digital space and then to a hybrid system before the physical courts fully reopened. Only recently when the situation started deteriorating, courts had to be shifted again to the virtual space. In recent times, lawyers who depended on day-to-day income suffered the most and the growing pendency has only grown bigger with adjournments or hearing of only certain types of cases, experts said. The rising number of Covid cases this April only juxtaposes the worst spike the Delhi district courts have ever seen. As a result, the anxiety in the judicial circuit is palpable. Terming the situation “quite alarming”, a judicial officer said a judge was in a critical state at LNJP Hospital. “I stay in a housing complex for judicial officers and a lot of people here are infected,” said the source. Another source stressed that the situation was “very, very alarming” given that some judges had to be hospitalised and the crumbling health system didn’t look promising. “Lots of judges and staff members are afflicted with Covid and most of them face the issue of non-availability of beds.” The source said, “Life-saving drugs like Remdesivir is totally out of stock. Doctors are feeling exhausted and frustrated. The system is crumbling in front of our eyes.” A large number of judicial staffers tested positive in the past couple of weeks and have been asked to isolate. There are also cases where family members of the staff have tested positive and as a result they have been asked to isolate themselves. A source attributed the high percentage of judicial staffers testing positive to travel in public transport and daily interaction with a large number of people in courts, exposing them to the viral infection. “A large section of the public in courts doesn’t wear masks properly or adhere to social distancing norms. Rising footfall with the start of full-fledged physical hearings has increased the risk of infection.” The tally of Covid-positive judicial officers is perhaps higher if other district court complexes that include the Saket court complex are taken into account. “At least 10 more judges (who don’t feature on the website) are positive. While one of them remains in the hospital, another judicial officer got discharged recently,” the source said. A senior judicial officer informed that several judges from various districts, including Dwarka courts, had taken ill. “Many more, being serious, were hospitalised,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/not-untouched-by-surge-district-courts-see-case-count-at-a-high/articleshow/82134938.cms||Aamir Khan

---||Jaipur||Remdesivir crisis deepens as active cases in Jaipur breach 13,000 mark||JAIPUR: With rapid surge in active cases in the city, the demand for remdesivir injection has increased manifold. On Sunday, attendants of patients admitted to private hospitals were running from pillar-to-post to get the dose, but all their efforts went in vain. Even doctors are not unable to get it for their relatives. A 90-year-old ophthalmologist Dr O P Kulshreshtha, former head of the department, ophthalmology, SMS hospital, is undergoing treatment for Covid at a private hospital near JK Lon hospital in Jaipur. Expressing helplessness, the hospital told his doctor son that remdesivir is not available in the hospital, following which the injection was searched for him, but all efforts went in vain. A doctor at the hospital told TOI, Dr Kulshreshtha needs remdesivir, but it is not available. “We have tried to find it, but we are not getting it from anywhere,” said the doctor. Private hospitals are asking attendants to get remdesivir for their patients. An attendant of a patient admitted to a private hospital in Vidhyadhar Nagar said, “We have tried all the sources to buy remdesivir. We called health department and also tried from private sellers, but to no avail. We are ready to pay more than double the price, but we are not getting it.” The private hospital’s body, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Society (PHNHS) claimed that the situation is really bad. “We are receiving calls for remdesivir/tocilizumab requirement for doctors and their families, but just not able to help,” said Dr Vijay Kapoor, secretary, PHNHS. He said that Dr Kulshreshtha has served patients at SMS hospital, but it is unfortunate that remdesivir is not available. At a Covid-19 review meeting, health minister Raghu Sharma raised the issue of remdesivir saying, “Medicine, oxygen and vaccines for Covid are all controlled by the Centre. If we raise the issue they will say we are doing politics.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/remdesivir-crisis-deepens-as-active-cases-in-city-breach-13k-mark/articleshow/82133948.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Shortfall leaves small pvt hosps gasping for oxygen||Mumbai/Thane: A day after 168 patients were shifted from six BMC hospitals due to oxygen shortage, several smaller private hospitals faced a scare on Sunday with dwindling oxygen stocks. While the supply in civic hospitals is likely to normalise by Monday noon, the situation for smaller private centres may continue to be grave.Frantic calls went from patient’s relatives and management of Andheri-based Axis Hospital that had oxygen supplies to last only two hours. Worried that the eight patients on oxygen support may have to be moved out, the hospital asked relatives to start searching for beds in other hospitals or help in arranging cylinders. Physician Dr Amit Shah, who consults with the hospital, said they managed the supplies in time with help from relatives and BMC officials. Most of the peripheral civic hospitals that faced a crisis on Friday and Saturday didn’t admit new patients on Sunday and mostly referred them to the jumbo facilities. Dr P Jadhav of Bandra’s Bhabha Hospital said they didn’t receive any oxygen from their regular supplier Satram Das Gases which led to the shortage over the weekend. Dr Alka Mane, superintendent of Shatabdi Govani, said they got six cylinders on Sunday instead of nine, but will admit patients once the supply is streamlined. BMC chief I S Chahal called the operation of shifting 168 patients on April 17 one of the most difficult nights in his life that fortunately ended without any casualties. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said Mumbai’s demand has increased to 235 tonnes, but so has demands from every district. “We hope the supply disruption from manufacturer to distributor will be resolved by Monday,” Kakani said. In Thane city too, the demand for oxygen has left several private hospitals in a quandary as many are now forced to either spend extra to secure emergency stock or relocate patients to other facilities. The last few days has seen a notable increase in oxygen beds with nearly 60% needing it with-in days of admission. The average demand has risen by nearly 1.5 times and is increasing each day, said officials from the collector’s office. Dr Manish Singh of Atlantis Hospital said he has very low oxygen stock left. “We are seeing a massive crunch of oxygen supply and few hospitals may be forced to relocate their patients to other facilities,” said Dr Santosh Kadam, president of the Thane chapter of IMA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-shortfall-leaves-small-pvt-hosps-gasping-for-oxygen/articleshow/82134940.cms||Manoj Badgeri

People who had come to get the first dose of the vaccine were turned away while those requiring a second dose were provided with it only at select centres. Government hospitals have also run out of antiviral injection, Remdesivir, administered to Covid-19 patients. No vaccination was done at 90 of the 227 designated centres in the district. As stocks rapidly depleted, 210 vaccine centres ran out of stocks on Sunday. Following a surge in Covid-19 cases since the last week of March, people have started flocking to the vaccination centres. The crowds swelled further after people above 45 years of age were allowed to take the vaccine from April 1. Madan Agarwal, 42, a resident of Bodla locality, said, “I was told at the primary health centre that the vaccine is out of stock. I am asked to come next week. Covid-19 is spreading rapidly, authorities must ensure availability of vaccines.” Confirming that centres had runout of Covid-19 vaccines, chief medical officer of Agra district, Dr RC Pandey, said, “The vaccination drive will resume on Monday as 15,000 doses are expected to arrive late on Sunday evening.” On shortage of Remdesivir injection, principal of SN Medical College, Dr Sanjay Kala said, “As the number of patents being admitted in critical condition is increasing, we have requested the state authorities to supply the medicine. We are expecting to receive sufficient stocks in the next two days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/210-of-227-covid-19-vaccine-centres-run-out-of-stocks-in-agra/articleshow/82133951.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Chandigarh||Punjab allows reuse of gunny bags to overcome shortage in grain markets||Chandigarh: The Punjab government on Sunday approved the packaging of wheat in “good quality used gunny bags provided by arhtiyas” to overcome the shortage of new gunny bags as well as polypropylene (PP) bags during the ongoing rabi marketing season (RMS) 2021-22. The arrival of wheat in Punjab grain markets (mandis) has increased to 8 lakh metric tonne (LMT) per day and there is a nationwide shortage of new gunny bags and new PP bags for storage of the procured wheat. Chief minister Amarinder Singh reviewed the status of wheat procurement with senior officials on Sunday. Regarding the issue of slow pace of purchase in the border districts of Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Tarn Taran and Ferozepur, it was explained that the grain of wheat in these areas is shriveled and accordingly there is a relaxation in procurement specifications required from the central government before it can be purchased. Punjab government had on April 16 written to the Centre to grant immediate relaxation in the uniform specifications of wheat in respect of shriveled and broken grains up to 11% and luster loss up to 10% in the districts of Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Fazilka without any value cut. However, the central government’s reply was still awaited. Capt Amarinder directed the food and supplies minister and the principal secretary of the department to immediately resolve the matter by pursuing it with the Union government.

While the orders issued by the TSBIE state that all the first-year inter students will be promoted to the next year, it also mentions that exams will be conducted in the future whenever possible. Members of the National Students Union of India (NSUI) held a protest at the TSBIE office on Saturday seeking clarity on the intermediate exams and promotion of students. “Police arrested us illegally while we tried to enter the BIE office to give a representation on behalf of intermediate students. We won’t allow the government to play with the students’ future and careers. Arrests don’t stop us from taking what we deserve,” tweeted Venkat Balmoor, president, NSUI (Telangana unit). Officials clarified that for now, the first-year students will be promoted to next year without examinations. “However, exams will be held as and when it is feasible. They will be awarded marks as per their performance in the exams. If they fail to clear the exams then they will have to appear in the supplementary exams,” said Omar Jaleel, secretary, TSBIE.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lack-of-clarity-on-exams-puts-inter-students-in-a-fix/articleshow/82137534.cms||---

For over 13 months, he has been in the same class and studying the same concepts, revising them, attempting mock tests, followed by prelims, all in preparation to score well. Yet, there is no certainty about the board exam for either SSc or HSC students. Having studied for the past 13 months for HSC and SSC exams, students from the state board schools are now losing patience. Many said the uncertainty was wearing them out, and they did not know how many more days and weeks they would have to study for the same portion. All the non-state boards have decided to either cancel the exams and mark students based on internal assessment. The decision for state board students still hangs in balance with the education department deciding to postpone the exams to June. Students and parents said the tempo to prepare for the big exam is waning, revision is becoming monotonous and there is mental fatigue. Another student, Krunal Dani, who is going to take the Std XII state board exams, said, “It is sure that the HSC boards will not be cancelled as the admissions to professional degree courses depend on these results. But, the arts and commerce stream students, will be promoted to first-year graduate courses. They should be promoted without exams, and the science students should get admissions based on the entrance test which is mandatory for every professional course. We should be liberated from this exam business which is going to be a mere formality.” The CBSE, ICSE, and IB students have received clear cut guidelines from their boards regarding the examinations In case of exams being cancelled, the students will either be marked based on internal assessments, year-long performance and if none of these methods are agreed upon by students then they get a chance to attempt the exam whenever they are scheduled. Schools in the city are also trying their best to keep students engaged during this period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ssc-hsc-pupils-feel-tired-as-exam-uncertainty-wears-on/articleshow/82138926.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The process to identify affected farmers has also started. "After the survey, a report will be sent to the disaster management department asking for immediate relief (compensation) to be provided to the farmers as per the state government guidelines," said SDM Prakash. Farmer Santokh Singh said, "I have never seen such a massive fire in my life. If the fire tenders had reached on time, the huge losses could have been averted." However, the cause behind the fire hasn't been ascertained as of yet. Another farmer said, “We had taken the land on contract for the purpose of agriculture at Rs 55,000-Rs 60,000 per year. We have already paid the contract money to the landowners but now our crop has been damaged and we will have to struggle even for two square meals this season. The government must provide us with financial compensation as we have pending expenses, including school fees of our children, bank installments, among others. We were expecting to pay for all these after harvesting the wheat.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/over-80-acres-of-wheat-crop-gutted-in-fire-in-us-nagar/articleshow/82133249.cms||Aakash Ahuja

Nagpur Residential Hotels’ Association (NRHA) says symptomatic patients will be shifted to hotels and if anything goes wrong, they may end up being liable for the repercussions.“It’s important for every hotel to be clear about what services the hospital is providing and the SOPs during an emergency. While planning for any situation we have to be ready for the most extreme possibility. If at all the patient’s heath deteriorates and complications arise then relatives might vent their anger on the hotel staff,” said NRHA president Tejinder Singh Renu. Cases of angry relatives damaging hospital premises have become common. “We don’t want hotel property to be damaged for no fault of our members,” added Renu.The association is also asking its members to ensure that their infrastructure meets all the safety guidelines and is certified by the competent authority. “Even in hospitals, cases of fire breaking out have happened. In such a scenario it is but natural for any law-abiding business establishment to ensure that their buildings comply with all safety norms,” he said.The current gold rush in hotels turning into Covid Care Centres is due to a huge gap between demand and supply of hospital beds. Many hospitals have tied up with hotels to take care of their patients.A hotel owner, who did not wish to be named, said these tie-ups are like a ‘lifeline’ to the collapsing sector. “We had no business for months, and the ray of hope seen in January vanished quickly. This way at least everyone benefits. Patients in need of supervised medical treatment get a bed, infrastructure load on hospitals is reduced and hotels too get some income,” said the owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-19-hotels-association-advises-members-to-take-care/articleshow/82134083.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

With around nine lakh people remaining to be vaccinated, it will take more than 70 days to inoculate all at the current rate. As per data of office of deputy director of health services, 3,03,475 people in the 45-59 age group and 2,90,376 people above 60 years have taken the first dose in the district, for a total of 5,93,851 doses. The estimated population in above 45 age group is around 15 lakh. It means 39.59% eligible persons were vaccinated in the district. The government had rolled out vaccine for 60-plus and 45-plus age group with comorbidities from March 1. From April 1, the government permitted inoculation to all people above 45 years. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has started 129 vaccination centres in the city. The civic body has also facilitated satellite centres for few vaccination centres. Zilla Parishad (ZP) is operating 136 centres in rural parts of the district. Thus, 265 centres are available in the district. As per officials of the NMC and ZP, around 300 persons can be easily covered at one centre in a day. Thus, 80,000 people can be vaccinated in a day in the district. Following spike in Covid-19 positive cases and deaths from March, guardian minister Nitin Raut and divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar had set target to complete vaccination of all people above 45 years by April end. They had set target of 40,000 inoculations every day. The number of beneficiaries was above 30,000 per day in the first week of April. Vaccination was above 40,000 on two days in the first week. The number declined to a great extent in the second week. Around 13,000 people, healthcare workers (HCWs), frontline workers (FLWs) are being vaccinated with the first and second dose in the district daily, which is much less as against total capacity of the vaccination centres. NMC officials told TOI, “Centres have been facilitated across the city. Mobilization is also being done with the help of special camps, NGOs, corporators etc. Registration facility has been provided in various ways. Still, response from eligible people is not up to the mark,” they said. Vice-president of Maharashtra Medical Council Dr Vinky Rughwani said, “People who were eager to get vaccinated thronged the centres and took the jab in initial days. Now, one or more member of every 10th family in the city is infected with Covid-19. Other members are avoiding vaccination fearing side effects if they are carrying the virus,” he said. Rughwani further said that there is misconception among few people that they are likely to get fever, body ache etc after taking vaccine and then they will test positive. “Authorities should spread awareness in this regard,” he said. The district has reported 7,17,553 people who have taken the first dose and remaining 1,23,702 are HCWs (58,265) and FLWs (65,437).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/only-6l-in-45-age-group-take-jab-in-dist-in-49-days/articleshow/82134101.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Delhi||Delhi lockdown news: Police to crack down on violators, help the needy||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police commissioner S N Shrivastava on Monday made an appeal to the migrant workers to stay put and assured they would be looked after, and all help would be provided. “A lockdown has been announced from 10pm tonight till 5am on April 26. My appeal to the residents is to stay indoors. Most essential services, commodities will be available,” Shrivastava said. TimesViewSome thought seems to have gone into formulating the punishment for curfew violations. This should help curb the number of rule-breakers. It is unfortunate that such creative measures were not applied till a crisis hit us. Had this been done earlier in dealing with those defying Covid-appropriate behaviour, we may not have come to this pass. He has instructed all District DCsP to be sympathetic towards the migrant labourers and extend whatever help and information required. Delhi Police has, meanwhile, made elaborate arrangements to strictly enforce the lockdown, with a large chunk of the force being brought on the road. This time, police are also planning to raise awareness among the violators on the spot. Apart from legal options, like FIR, arrest and jail, the cops are contemplating to make them aware about Covid-appropriate behaviour. Delhi Police brass has asked the cops on the ground to replicate last year’s protocols, which involves cracking down on violators and facilitating the needy. District DCsP made in charge of enforcement have been asked to form teams accordingly. Shrivastava reviewed the preparedness and plan of action to follow on the ground and directed all field officers to enforce restrictions and prosecute anyone found in wilful disobedience to the restriction order without a valid ground or exemption. He has asked the District DCsP to make extensive arrangements of pickets, patrolling and police presence on the ground. “Anyone coming out of home will be definitely checked and questioned. If anyone is found moving without a valid emergency or movement pass for essential services or goods, they will be stopped, and case registered against them. They may face arrest too. Medical services, food material, fruits and vegetables supply need to go on usual for normal life,” Shrivastava said. He simultaneously emphasised that the genuine needs of people, such as people in medical emergencies and essential services, would be allowed. The DCsP were asked to ensure policemen were careful to observe personal safety norms – wearing appropriate mask, social distancing and hand hygiene. It is the responsibility of the DCsP and SHOs to take care of the well-being of their personnel by following strict Covid discipline, stressed Shrivastava.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-to-crack-down-on-violators-help-the-needy/articleshow/82152470.cms||---

In all, 20 candidates have filed papers till Sunday, the last day to file nominations. D Rajasekhar Reddy of Congress too has filed his nomination. However, Congress has not given B-form to any candidate. The party has decided to give B-forms only on the last day of withdrawal of nominations, i.e., April 20, in case of Lingojiguda division in Greater Hyderabad limits. BJP has already requested Congress not to field its candidate and make it a unanimous election for the saffron party. On the request of the saffron party leaders, TRS working president KT Rama Rao has announced their decision not to contest Lingojiguda ward in GHMC. Congress is yet to respond to BJP request. Congress is likely to take a decision on Monday. Sources in Congress said that the party leadership is in a dilemma over the fact that the BJP is a divided house. “While BJP leader and ex-MLC Ramachander Rao among other leaders have requested Congress leadership not to contest Lingojiguda ward, BJP state president Bandi Sanjay seems to be unhappy about this. TPCC president along with senior leaders are likely to meet on Monday to take a final call,” a senior leader said. The by-poll to Lingojiguda ward has been necessitated due to the death of BJP corporator-elect Akula Ramesh Goud, who died before taking oath as a corporator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lingojiguda-bypoll-cong-to-decide-on-contest-today/articleshow/82134105.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Hyderabad||Defer civic polls, Congress urges election commission||Hyderabad: Former minister Mohammed Ali Shabbir has urged the Telangana State Election Commission (TSEC) to postpone elections to seven urban local bodies (ULBs), including Greater Warangal and Khammam municipal corporations, and nine casual vacancies in other civic bodies in view of the worsening Covid-19 situation. In a letter to state election commissioner C Partha Sarathi on Sunday, Shabbir Ali said Covid-19 cases were increasing at an alarming rate in the poll-bound districts of Warangal, Khammam, Siddipet, Nagarkurnool, Mahbubnagar among others. While the entire country is finding ways to minimise the damage due to the second wave of Covid-19, it would be highly inappropriate for TSEC to hold polls at this juncture.  “It will be like exposing 11,26,221 voters and their families in seven ULBs to the risk of getting infected with Covid-19. Further, about 9,000 polling staff and thousands of security personnel, who will be deployed for poll duties, too would be directly exposed to Covid-19 infection. Therefore, in view of public safety, we request you to kindly postpone the elections on an immediate basis,” Shabbir Ali said. The state government has cancelled SSC exams and promoted Intermediate first year students, while deferring the second-year exams. Many national events, including the historic Kumbh Mela have been wound up in 13 days before its actual schedule. Since the municipal elections would involve intense electioneering by all political parties and candidates by way of public meetings, rallies and other gatherings, the common people would face the risk of getting Covid-19 infection. Even door-to-door campaigning would not be safe as many asymptomatic people might move freely in these districts as super-spreaders, Shabbir Ali said in his letter to Paratha Sarathi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/defer-civic-polls-congress-urges-election-commission/articleshow/82134106.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: MBBS graduates can’t skip bond service||MUMBAI: MBBS graduates in Maharashtra who have completed their internships before March 31 will have to go through the mandatory bond service this year. The Directorate of Health Services issued a circular to this effect on Friday. The circular for the first time also includes the list of around 2,500 eligible graduates. Even the ones keen on pursuing post-graduation will have to serve the bond till they secure a seat.  The circular specifies that penal action will be taken against candidates not reporting to the allotted centre within seven days. Additionally, the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) will be deploying over 7,000 medical interns on Covid duty across the state soon, besides creating a pool of 11,000 graduating nurses available for fresh appointments in hospitals facing a shortage. “Post-graduate entrance exams have been postponed in the country. Whenever students get a seat they can opt out, but till then they will have to complete the bond service. We are in a pandemic and action will be taken against students resisting the bond service. The compulsory bond will ensure we have doctors in district hospitals and rural centres too," said Dr TP Lahane, director, DMER, to which students have to apply. Exemption will be granted only to those who pay Rs 10 lakh as bond, as is the rule. Medical graduates have been asked to apply to DMER by April 21 in an online process. Offline applications will not be accepted, said the circular. Candidates have been asked to apply for Thane, Pune, Nashik, Kolhapur, Nagpur, Akola, Aurangabad and Latur circles only. Students who tried to apply have sought to know why Mumbai is not available as an option. While students sign the bond every year during admissions, most do not honour it after graduating.  But with the state ramping up facilities, the requirement for manpower will soon go up. DMER is, therefore, making bond service mandatory this year, especially for rural areas. “The process has moved online for the first time, but there is no clarity on several aspects,” said Dwij Mehta, an MBBS graduate. Another student said there are vacancies at jumbo Covid centres in Mumbai too. “The circular says students getting an allotment will have to report to the institute within seven days, failing which penal action will be taken. But without clarity on whether Mumbai will be allowed at a later stage, how do we apply online now?” she asked. Lahane said students who have already started working at Covid centres will be allowed to continue. Sudha Shenoy, a parent representative said, “If PG aspirants complete a few months of bond service before their admissions, will it be carried forward later?” She added that all these doubts should be clarified in another circular soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-mbbs-grads-cant-skip-bond-service/articleshow/82134978.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Kochi||80 acres at Brahmapuram become a burden for corp||Kochi: The 80 acres acquired by the government in Brahmapuram for providing adequate land for Kochi corporation’s solid waste treatment plant has turned out to be a big burden for the local body. More than a decade after acquiring the land, now the local body has to pay an additional compensation running into crores to the landowners. Besides the one-time amount spent by the state government during the 2008-09 period for acquiring the land, the cost of land increased as the landowners moved the court seeking additional compensation. Now, the government has decided to deduct the additional compensation amount of around Rs 120 crore from the plan fund allocation to the local body in instalments. The government has already deducted Rs 10 crore from the plan fund share of the corporation in the past three months. “The additional compensation to be distributed to the landowners has become a huge responsibility for the corporation. Though the land is registered in the name of the corporation, there is a control of the government over the use of the land. So, the government should pay the additional compensation,” said Congress councillor M G Aristotle. “The government cut more than Rs 5 crore from the corporation’s plan fund allocation as the first instalment in March, 2021. Now, it has again deducted another Rs 5 crore from the plan fund allocation this month also. It is learnt that the plan is to deduct three instalments of Rs 5 crore every year. Given the financial condition of the corporation, it will affect the implementation of the local body’s projects,” Aristotle said. Corporation authorities have requested the state government not to deduct the amount from the civic body’s plan fund allocation. “We have sent a letter requesting that the corporation should be exempted from shouldering the burden of paying the additional compensation. We are awaiting a reply from the government,” mayor M Anilkumar said. It is learnt that it would take quite some time for the government to take a decision in this regard. It will require several rounds of discussions after the new government assumes office. Corporation had set up a solid waste treatment plant in around 40 acres owned by it at Brahmapuram in 2006. Then, the residents in the vicinity of the plant demanded that their land holdings also should be acquired by the government. It was the stench emanating from the waste and health hazards stemming out of it that forced the residents to come up with such a demand. So, the government took over 80 acres near the plant premises. Though the government paid compensation to the landowners while acquiring land, they moved the court citing that the compensation was insufficient. “But, the corporation authorities didn’t challenge the demand by the landowners before the court. This led to the court pronouncing orders asking the government to pay the additional compensation. Had the local body impleaded in the case, the quantum of additional compensation could have been decreased,” a former councillor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/80-acres-at-brahmapuram-become-a-burden-for-corp/articleshow/82133312.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

He termed news reports about HD 2967 wheat variety not being purchased in Malwa belt as baseless. Ashu said this variety was being cultivated by farmers for many years and it had also been approved by Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana. He maintained that every procurement agency was procuring this variety. Clarifying the controversy around the variety, Ashu said the problem came about because a few heaps of the wheat had not been cleaned in accordance with set specifications. He said the state government had asked farmers concerned to bring the cleaned crop. The food supplies minister made it clear that the Food Corporation of India (FCI) had not refused to procure any wheat variety. According to him, 750 quintals of HD 2967 wheat variety was purchased at Dhammu (Mansa) mandi on April 16 and 4,500 quintals was purchased in this centre on April 17. Ashu reiterated the commitment of the state government to purchase farmers entire produce.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/procurement-of-hd-2967-variety-of-wheat-smooth-in-punjab-minister/articleshow/82135948.cms||---

Residents of Old City said they are facing frequent power cuts and mosquito menace, and the lack of redressal of the grievances by officials has made matters worse. “Power cuts and mosquito menace at night has become a regular affair. Though the matter has been reported to local leaders, they have failed to address our concerns,” said Younus, a resident of Jahanuma. Mujtaba Askari, president of Helping Hand Foundation, an NGO, said that several people are struggling to avail treatment and added that the state should declare health emergency and impose night curfew. “Place restrictions over mass gatherings in religious places, rallies and other events. Take over beds in private hospitals and pay bills of poor patients. Ensure oxygen supplies to hospitals and other oxygen suppliers immediately and ensure that private hospitals do not charge exorbitantly,” he urged the state. Residents also urged the government to restrict entry of outsiders. “Free treatment and availability of beds for the poor should be the first priority. Free treatment should be made available in slum areas and for senior citizens. The state government should declare a health emergency,” said Asif Hussain Sohail, a social activist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/activists-urge-govt-to-declare-health-emergency-impose-curfew/articleshow/82134116.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Worried post 1st jab? Digest this capsule||What should be done or avoided after the first jab of Covid vaccine? Take plenty of fluids, rest, do not work out. As a prophylaxis, paracetamol 500 can be taken after meals soon after the shot. Avoid smoking and alcohol, as they interfere with the efficacy of the vaccine. Is there a specific diet during, before, or after the vaccine? As the vaccine is inter-dermal, it has nothing to do with diet. However, doctors recommend a home-made, healthy diet. Also, sufficient fluid is advised to keep oneself hydrated during fever. What changes are accepted after the first shot? When to see a doctor? One can have mild fever, swelling or pain around the site of the shot, myalgia (muscle pains), or fatigue. This is normal and one need not worry. However, if the fever persists for more than 72 hours, or one complaints of diarrhoea, one must report to a doctor. In case someone tests positive soon after the first dose, when can the second dose be taken? After four and six weeks of testing positive, the second dose can be taken. Otherwise, the recommended gap between the two doses is six and eight weeks. It is said that Covishield has side effects such as thrombosis (blood clots). What is the information on this? Some countries such as Italy recommended using AstraZeneca’s shot only on those above 60. In Britain, for healthy people under 30, the health risks from catching Covid are low but there may be a slightly higher rate of the blood clot condition in younger people when they get AstraZeneca. There is no such recommendation in India. What are the contraindications for taking Covid vaccine? Lactating mothers, those below 18, and pregnant women are not advised, while rest all can take the shot. Those on blood thinners or chemotherapy can also take the vaccine after consulting their doctor. However, after any surgery, wait 15 days before taking the vaccine. Can those who have fever also take the vaccine? It is better to wait for the fever to subside and be healthy before taking the vaccine. This is to avoid further, light side effects of the vaccine. What precautions must be taken after the first shot? Do not disregard the Covid-appropriate behaviour. As the antibodies take time to develop, one must keep on wearing the mask, observe social distancing, and maintain hand hygiene. Even after complete immunisation, there have been cases of Covid infection, as the immunisation is not 100% protective. It can only reduce the severity of the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/worried-post-1st-jab-digest-this-capsule/articleshow/82133300.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Rahmat was suffering from a high fever and low oxygen levels for the last four days and couldn’t timely get admitted despite several efforts by their family members. After the teacher fraternity appealed for her immediate admission at various social media platforms she was finally admitted to TS Mishra hospital on Saturday. “Her oxygen levels had dropped down to 50. Their family members were struggling to get her admitted and had sent SOS messages to district magistrate and other government officials and groups.  Finally, when she got an admission it was too late. Her oxygen levels didn’t improve and she passed away at 4.30 pm at the TS Mishra hospital,” Manoj Pandey, president of the Lucknow University Associated College Teachers’ Association said. “When she was rushed to the hospital her oxygen levels further dropped and the admission formalities took at least three-four 4 hours and by then her condition had turned more critical,” said a colleague from her college. “She was an excellent teacher, good researcher and dedicated academician. It is a big loss for our college,” she added. Meanwhile, six more Lucknow University teachers tested Covid positive taking the number of teachers infected to 28. So far, six professors of LU, including three retired and three serving, had succumbed to Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/karamats-teacher-succumbs-to-covid/articleshow/82134976.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Dehradun||Kumbh Mela: Most camps wear a deserted look||HARIDWAR: A day after PM Modi’s appeal to hold Kumbh mela in a symbolic manner, most of the camps bore a deserted look as seers of prominent sanyasi akhadas like Juna, Atal, Agni, Ahavan, Niranjani and Anand — who have announced closure of Kumbh for their seers — started leaving their camps. Those who could not, were planning to do so on Monday in view of the state-wide lockdown that has now been imposed in Uttarakhand on Sundays. Mahant Hari Giri, patron of Juna Akhada told TOI that almost 80% of seers from his akhada had already left Kumbh and only a few seers will take a symbolic dip on the last shahi snan on April 27. “We do not want to risk the lives of the seers and pilgrims coming to Haridwar at a time when Covid cases are rising phenomenally. Therefore, a collective decision was made regarding closure of the Kumbh by our akhada,” he said. Juna Akhada — the largest of the 13 sects of seers in the country — had pulled out of the religious festival after convening a meeting of its core committee on Saturday. Meanwhile, seers of the Bairagi and Udasin sects reiterated that they will continue to stay on in the Kumbh mela and will participate in the last shahi snan. According to estimates, around half of the seers and most of the devotees from the Bada and Naya Udasin akhadas had left the Kumbh mela area. While the Bairagi seers were camping on, presence of devotees in their camps was extremely low. Presence of devotees at the evening Ganga aarti at the Har-ki-Pauri ghat was also minimal on Sunday. “Even though some seers are saying that they will stay for the last shahi snan, most of the camps are almost empty. The Kumbh is more or less over,” said an official from the mela administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kumbh-wears-a-deserted-look-as-seers-leave-mela/articleshow/82136264.cms||---

The situation has put additional pressure on these hospitals which have high influx of Covid patients. At least 30% staff is infected at KGMU which has been converted into a full-fledged Covid facility. “The disease is so infectious that every time a team goes on 14-day Covid duty, nearly one-fourth of them return with infection,” a senior KGMU official said. “Many are under home isolation while some have been admitted to hospital. Bed availability is low and pressure has doubled due to shortage of workforce,” he added. At Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences, at least 600 out of 2,000 staff members are Covid- positive. “Around 30% of our staff is infected. Even non-Covid teams are also falling prey to the virus because identifying positive patients is even more difficult there,” said RMLIMS spokesperson Dr Shrikesh Singh. “We have almost completely vaccinated our staff and asking them to use protective gear while working,” said Dr Singh. Similar situation prevails at Balrampur Hospital. “In about 72 hours, at least 24 staff members, including 15 doctors, tested positive. The testing unit has been shut for 48 hours for sanitization,” said nodal officer for Covid facility at Balrampur Hospital Dr VK Panday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/30-health-staff-in-grip-of-coronavirus/articleshow/82134980.cms||Yusra Husain

The All India Industrial Exhibition (AIIE) Society, a 17-member managing committee headed by minister for medical and health, Eatala Rajender, has advised to repay the deposits of stallholders after reviewing the pandemic situation. “With spike in cases, and hospitals packed with patients, organising Numaish has become a tough task. Moreover, stallholders who deposited the amounts for the 46-day annual exhibition, were also unhappy over the inordinate delay over the beginning of Numaish,” according to a member of AIIE Society. The AIIE Society has been inviting applications from the stallholders and allotting spaces on the sprawling 23-acre exhibition ground for decades now. “We followed the same procedure this year too. We decided to allow 2,400 stalls, but have put the exhibition on hold due to the surge in cases,” he said. The stallholders were mounting pressure on the managing committee to return the deposits, saying they took lakhs of rupees as loan from banks, private finance companies, and individuals on huge interest, said the AIIE member. When TOI contacted secretary, AIIE Society, Dr B Prabha Shankar, he said, “As per the decision taken by the managing committee, we have returned the deposits. Of course, deposits is one of the main income source to the Exhibition Society after tickets fare, but there was no other option than to return them.” The 81st All India Industrial Exhibition was supposed to be held between January 1 and February 15. “We had made appeals to the state government twice to organise the annual exhibition.

Residents say that the change in strategy by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) to make the city clean by removing garbage bins from street corners is not helping as the size of the roadside and street corner mounds keeps growing every day. “There is garbage being dumped in street corners. Earlier, we had the blue garbage bins that would overflow and now the problem has become worse because there is not even a designated place for people to dump garbage. It is just dumped anywhere on the road,” said Mohammed Ahmed, pointing at a garbage dump near his residence at Shalibanda. Similar situation prevails next to Nice Hospital in Vijayanagar colony where an entire stretch of road is filled with garbage. “Litter litter everywhere, not a good sight to see. Garbage piled up in Vijayanagar colony, Dattatreya Colony and many such places. What’s happening?” tweeted Farida Tampal @ftampal, state director, World Wildlife Fund. Meanwhile, on Sunday morning, following the directions of municipal administration and urban development minister KT Rama Rao for a sanitation drive to clear the garbage in the city, mayor Gadwal Vijayalakshmi carried out surprise inspections in Khairatabad and Charminar zones. The mayor visited several garbage dumping points in Mehdipatnam and Karwan circles and expressed her displeasure at the piled up trash. She lashed out at sanitary workers for not clearing the garbage at regular intervals. “Look at the bathrooms leaking. Is there room for people to even walk here?,” she was heard questioning the sanitation worker at Vijayanagar colony. The mayor also visited a garbage transfer point and monitored its performance. Speaking about the garbage being dumped on roadsides and around public toilets in south zone, Samrat Ashok, GHMC zonal commissioner said, “We have already instructed our staff and deployed teams to get it cleaned.” On Saturday, MAUD minister KT Rama Rao had directed GHMC to ensure that garbage is cleared in the city within four days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmc-move-raises-a-stink-as-trash-piles-up-on-roads/articleshow/82134134.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Kolkata||New Town pushes for tree cover for all plots||Kolkata: The New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) has issued an eight-point advisory urging residents of New Town to go in for planting trees in all plots, setting up electric vehicle charging points at car parking spaces inside housing complexes, using solar roof-top panels to give shade to rooftop urban farming, rainwater harvesting and so on. According to officials, the plan is to initiate the process to modify the NKDA rules on these once the elections are over. As per the advisories, every plot in New Town should have a tree cover irrespective of its size and use, a part of car parking space inside housing complexes should have facilities for electric vehicle charging and buildings should have roof-top rainwater harvesting systems. The plan is to include this in the NKDA building rules. Waste water recycling system shall be developed in all buildings, including group housings that has a minimum discharge of 25,000 litres and above per day for flushing of toilets, gardening and car washing. The roof area of each building will have reflecting paint and solar panels to minimize the heat absorption and all plot owners are encouraged to include roof-top garden with solar sheds. Also, to minimize water waste, authorities have come up with maximum permissible limit of portable water of 120 litre per capita per day for residential population and 40 litre per capita per day for the floating population of New Town. NKDA officials said that the idea is an outcome of a video conference that was held a few months ago with NGOs and experts as to how the authority could take up initiatives to develop a green and sustainable environment in New Town. The NKDA and the Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) have been taking various initiatives to develop New Town as an environment-friendly sustainable township. Last year, New Town was awarded ‘platinum-rated Green City certificate’ by the Indian Green Building Council. NKDA is also planning to create a ‘Centre of Excellence on Sustainability’ later this year in collaboration with NGOs and expert institutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-town-pushes-for-tree-cover-for-all-plots/articleshow/82134146.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Chief secretary Somesh Kumar has also tested positive. Employees from finance, municipal administration among other departments are under home isolation after testing positive. Employees said the government is proposing to reimplement “employees’ rotation-rule” in view of rising Covid-19 cases among employees. A decision on allowing only 50% employees to come to office and remaining to work from home, on alternate days, is under active consideration. The chief secretary will soon make a final decision. Sources said the threat of spread of Covid-19 is more in the Secretariat in BRKR Bhavan as it is not as spacious as the old Secretariat buildings. Until the new secretariat complex is constructed, officials will continue to work from BRKR Bhavan. ‘No mask, no entry’ rule is strictly being followed in the secretariat, directorates and other government offices. Restrictions have also been imposed on the entry of visitors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/50-sectt-staffers-at-brkr-bhavan-tested-ve-so-far/articleshow/82134147.cms||Roushan Ali

Two days passed; younger one took first available flight from Dubai to reach Lucknow, while elder one drove non-stop in seven-hour long journey from Delhi to get their 56-year-old mother admit in a hospital. On the fourth day, that is Sunday morning they finally managed to get non-covid hospital for their ill-mother, who is now in ICU fighting for her life. Enraged over the government machinery which failed to help their Covid infected mother, the elder daughter said, “After failing to reach ICCC helpline, an SOS was directly shared with government officials about my mother’s condition, following which a man called and informed us that patient will be either shifted in RML, Era or KGMU hospital based on the bed availability, to which I nodded and anxiously waited for ambulance. Twenty-four hours passed, but the ambulance never came and neither the man picked up his phone. Then I drove back to Lucknow and along with my younger sister we decided to shift our mother to non-Covid hospital, so that oxygen saturation level is brought back to over 90.” “I had high hopes from the healthcare system and was banking on the services, but I feel cheated now. I have never felt so helpless. I only got hollow assurances for a full day that an ambulance is on the way but it never came. We did everything possible on our own to get her to a small (non-Covid) hospital nearby and now cannot think of moving her again,” said the woman who hails from Mahanagar area. Similarly, in another case, a 63-year-old woman, also mother of two girls, was left helpless by the city based Covid helpline as she fought for her life. Her O2 level dropped to 42, fortunately her elder daughter managed one oxygen cylinder, but did not receive any help from ICCC. She is now trying to find a hospital to shift her mother, as her younger sister and father are also covid positive and have been isolated but are stable. “Frantically I have been trying to contact ICCC, sent SOS to government officials, but have received no response. Exhausted from failed attempts, now I’m searching for non-Covid hospital who can admit my mother. She will die, no help is received soon,” said the woman based in Sector N of Ashiyana area. Like them, scores of residents continued to contact authorities for help, but no help was received.

Schools are planning to conduct online tests to keep the students focused. More than eight lakh students were scheduled to appear for the board exams between May 5 and May 31. While postponing the exams, the state government also announced that the practical exams, which had already begun, will be held as planned till April 23. The government also asked all coaching centres to stop taking physical classes. Adeline Samuel, a parent, said, "If the exams are postponed till June or July, then it would affect the admissions to higher educational institutions. It will also affect the students’ preparations for exams like National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET).” Ezhil, another parent, said the state government should have specified when the situation would be reviewed. "The physical tests ahead of the board exams were very effective. But, we don't know how effective the online revision tests are before the board exam. It will be difficult for both students and teachers," she said. Schools have also welcomed the decision to postpone the board exams. "I think it's a good move. We don't want to take too much risk by conducting the exam," said G J Manohar, principal of MCC Higher Secondary School in Chetpet. To keep the students focussed, the school plans to conduct online revision classes. N Vijayan, senior principal of Zion Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Tambaram, said the second wave was affecting everyone and it was the right decision to put off the exam.

All students except those in the final year will write the test and will be allowed to refer to course material in physical form as well as on the web. Group discussions will be considered malpractice, the university. The university had earlier conducted a 60-minute online proctored test with multiple choice based questions. “During that test, students tried to form WhatsApp groups and groups in Telegram to outsmart the online proctored test. Hence, the university has decided to move to descriptive type tests,” sources said. According to the new format, the question paper will have Part A that will comprise five two-mark questions and Part B which will include five eight-mark questions. One question will be asked from each of the five units and there will be no choices for the Part B section. “All questions in the exam will be of analytical type with no direct answers from the textbooks or reference books. Students can refer to course material in physical form as well as from the web. However, getting answers from others in any way or form and group discussions will be considered a malpractice,” said a circular from the Centre for Academic Courses at Anna University. Students can use a maximum of 12 pages for writing the answers. They have to scan and upload answer sheets after completing the exam. The exams will be conducted for a total of 50 marks and will be for 90 minutes. For the final year students, the end semester exams will be conducted in a multiple choice-based questions pattern as it was conducted earlier. The final year students need to appear for exams immediately so the university will conduct MCQ type exams. “This decision was taken as a ‘one-time measure’ in view of the Covid-19 pandemic,” the circular said. A professor from Anna University said that with MCQ-type questions, students will get either one mark or zero. “In the case of descriptive-type questions, the students can at least score minimum marks,” he said. The university will have three sets of question papers and the questions will be jumbled so students will not have the same questions or question paper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/anna-univ-semester-exam-to-be-open-book/articleshow/82134161.cms||A Ragu Raman

After NCTE stopped admissions in government colleges over shortage of faculty members, the DCE has transferred 18 faculty members from government arts and science colleges to government colleges of education. It also transferred 31 lecturers from district institutes of education and training (DIET) for one year after the recruitment of lecturers by Teachers Recruitment Board was delayed. Following these moves, the NCTE gave its nod to admissions to BEd programmes in March. More than 3,000 students have applied to the 2,000 seats available in seven government colleges of education and 14 government-aided colleges. "The continuous efforts of the higher education department has ensured that seats in government colleges of education do not go to waste this year. There are around 400 vacant seats in government-aided colleges," sources in the higher education department said. Counselling was held online due to the Covid-19 pandemic in March. The online registration for BEd admissions in government and government-aided college was held from December 4 to 10 last year. "The first-year students will write their exams in September. The next academic year for these students will start from October. Due to Covid-19 pandemic, we have been conducting classes online for these students," a faculty member from a government college of education said. The state government has not filled the vacancies in government BEd colleges since 2009. NCTE has increased the duration of BEd degree from one year to two years in 2016. Due to the increase of the course duration, the government colleges needed to double their teaching faculty. As per the norms, each government college with 100 students needs to have 16 faculty members for BEd course and for MEd colleges need to have 10 faculty members for 50 students. But, the seven colleges had only half the staff strength. Citing huge number of vacancies, the southern regional committee of NCTE stopped admission to government BEd Colleges for 2020-21 last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/govt-colleges-of-education-fill-850-bed-seats-for-2021-22/articleshow/82134157.cms||---
---||Delhi||SC forms committee to inspect Yamuna water entering Delhi||New Delhi: As Delhi and Haryana blame each other for pollution in the Yamuna, leading to a drinking water problem in Delhi, the Supreme Court on Monday appointed a committee headed by secretary of the Jal Shakti ministry to inspect and file a report on the quality and quantity of water coming from Haryana to Delhi at the Wazirabad plant. A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao, A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian decided to set up the committee after allegations from the two states. The committee, also comprising one member each from Delhi Pollution Control Board, Delhi Jal Board, Haryana Pollution Control Board and Haryana Agricultural Board, is to file a report within three days and the bench will examine it on Friday. The bench passed the order on a petition by DJB alleging that Haryana was deliberately discharging pollutants in the Yamuna, which resulted in rise of ammonia level in the water. The board said the neighbouring state was taking advantage of its geographical location as an upper riparian state in asserting "right to pollute the river". Haryana government, however, alleged that DJB was diverting water before it reached Wazirabad and blamed the board for lower water level at its Wazirabad plant. The bench, after hearing both sides briefly, decided that an independent committee be asked to find out the truth by inspecting the site. DJB’s petition said it was forced to approach the SC as the right to clean drinking water was a fundamental right and Delhi was facing severe water crisis in the summer season when the demand of water peaks. "The continued actions/inaction of the respondents have led to largescale reductions of up to 30% in water supply in many areas supplied by the Wazirabad, Chandrawal and Okhla water treatment plants, and has a direct and potentially devastating impact on the right of residents of the NCT of Delhi to clean and adequate drinking water. Even on April 4, the ammonia level in Yamuna at the point it enters the Wazirabad reservoir was 4.4 ppm, which is much higher than the ammonia level that the plants of the board can process for purification," it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-forms-committee-to-inspect-yamuna-water-entering-delhi/articleshow/82152573.cms||---

From daily meal plans to packages for 14 days of isolation, home chefs and cloud kitchens have stepped up to serve a variety of meals to those already struggling to cope up with Covid-19. It was after tragedy hit her own home that Madhavi Chepur, 47, decided to start a cloud kitchen (Kwik Meal 7) with her friend Revathy Venkateshan in Vidya Nagar. “During the lockdown, we realised that many elderly people who had their children settled abroad were facing food crisis. We started serving food to them. Over the last few days, we even got enquiries from Covid-19 infected patients and their family members,” said Chepur, who provides lunch and dinner at a cost of Rs 7,500 (excluding transportation charges) per month to those residing around Osmania University and neighbouring areas. They have employed people who lost their livelihood during the lockdown in their cloud kitchen. Some have started serving vegetarian meals from their home kitchens. “It has been two months since I started delivering home cooked south Indian meals from my kitchen to people in need. In breakfast, I serve idli, upma, poha etc. and for lunch and dinner, I serve two curries, dal, rasam, sambar, curd and rice. Currently, I am delivering food to about 20-30 people in different areas,” said U Shailaja, 40, resident of Bowenpally, who charges Rs 400 for three meals. Even restaurants have listed out packages for supplying food for 14-day quarantine period inclusive of breakfast, lunch and dinner. One such restaurant in Attapur is offering a 14-day package at a cost of Rs 4,000 to Rs 8,000 per month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/home-chefs-whip-up-meals-for-infected/articleshow/82134177.cms||Preeti Biswas
---||Chennai||Raw sewage continues to flow into Pallavaram lake||Chennai: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has been repeatedly asking various state agencies to clean up lakes in Pallavaram in a coordinated manner, but the authorities concerned continue to pass the buck. Even now, sewage continues to overflow on the surface of Grand Southern Trunk (GST) Road and this waste eventually reaches the Pallavaram Lake through inlet channels and storm water drains (SWD). From Pallavaram Lake, the sewage reaches Putheri and Narayanapuram lakes. The state highways department, which constructed and maintains the SWD on GST Road, on Thursday (April 15) wrote to Pallavaram Municipality for not taking any action against sewage overflow in the stretch between Kalyan Jewellers and Chromepet Police Station. Citing potential health hazards, the highways department wanted the local body to stop the overflow immediately. But a visit to the location on Sunday revealed that barricades were placed above open drains to cover-up the overflow. David Manohar of Arappor Iyakkam, an anti-corruption NGO, "Since the western side of GST Road is on a higher plain (gradient of at least two feet), domestic waste, which flows through municipality's underground sewage system (UGSS), reaches the SWD on the main GST Road". All state agencies were hand in glove and never actedagainst any of the violations, he said, demanding an independent commission to look into the issue and save the water bodies. NGT, which took suo-moto cognizance of pollution in the Pallavaram and Putheri Lake, is hearing the case again on April 20. The Pallavaram Municipality had earlier told the tribunal that all defects were repaired and no overflow was reported in their underground sewage system (UGSS) since October 2020. But photos and videos shot by Pallavaram residents suggest that pollution continues unabated. Meanwhile, a senior Tamil Nadu Public Works Department (PWD) official said that they were planning to restore and renovate all lakes in Kovalam basin including Putheri under Comprehensive Flood Mitigation Project with an amount of Rs.2,000 crore. The project involves creation of biodiversity parks around the banks of the water body to prevent future encroachment. On approval from the World Bank, the project scheme will be executed at Putheri Lake along with all repair or renewal of shutter works. he added. The only positive takeaway now was that lab analysis of water samples, collected from the lake, suggested that pH, heavy metals (Copper, Zinc, Lead, Chromium and Nickel etc) and bacterial levels were within levels prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/raw-sewage-continues-to-flow-into-pallavaram-lake/articleshow/82134173.cms||Ram Sundaram

An order by Lucknow’s officiating district magistrate Roshan Jacob said all infrastructural amenities at Awadh Shilpgram, including furniture, electricity and water services be handed over to DRDO with immediate effect. Lok Sabha representative of Lucknow MP Rajnath Singh, Diwakar Tripathi, said: “DRDO has started building Covid hospital in Lucknow at Awadh Shilpgram site on mission mode. The hospital will have a combination of oxygen enabled beds and ICU facilities. Hospital layout designs have been completed and preliminary implementation activities have started in various halls of Awadh Shilpgram. It is expected that dry run checks for testing of various advanced medical facilities will start soon.” TOI had earlier reported that the makeshift hospitals will be provided with an oxygen plant based on the mechanism currently used for fighter pilots of Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas. The technology developed for the aircraft breaks down molecules of atmospheric oxygen making the system self-sustainable in oxygen production. This plant can provide medical grade oxygen at a high flow rate catering to at least 50 ventilator ICU beds round the clock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/drdo-takes-over-awadh-shilpgram-to-build-300-bed-makeshift-covid-hospital/articleshow/82135054.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Madurai||HC dismisses MKU plea over contract dispute||Madurai: Madras high court has dismissed the plea moved by Madurai Kamaraj University (MKU) challenging the order passed by Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council seeking its explanation about the amount pending disbursal to a private company. Observing that the university was barking up the wrong tree, Justice V Parthiban said a writ court is not a proper forum to settle a dispute of this nature involving interpretation of contractual terms and agreement and adjudication of the rival claims. MKU had in 2014 entered into an agreement with Coimbatore-based Set Infotect Pvt Ltd for creation of an e-learning portal and development of digital content for the directorate of distance education. On completion of the project stage-wise, the company forwarded the bills from time to time which were settled by the university.In December 2020, the company issued a legal notice alleging non-payment of bills to the tune of Rs 5.35 crore and also non-refund of earnest money deposit amount of Rs 15 lakh. The university sent a detailed reply to the notice in January 2021. Pressing its claim, the company moved the MSEF council for adjudication of the dispute. The council issued summons to the university which challenged it in the HC through the present petition.Justice Parthiban observed that the court is unable to appreciate the filing of the writ petition by the university when the notice merely requests it to offer its remarks in response to the claim of the company. The university was trying to convert the constitutional jurisdiction of the court into a court of inquiry or arbitration for adjudication of the factual controversies between the parties, and also for adjudication of the relevant terms of contractual agreement, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-dismisses-mku-plea-over-contract-dispute/articleshow/82135516.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The court was hearing the bail petition of Dhanakodi, a Tangedco assistant engineer arrested by DVAC officials on March 24. The prosecution case is that when a man submitted an application for getting two new electricity service connections for his newly constructed house, the petitioner, who was working as an assistant engineer at Veeramarasanpettai in Budhalur taluk, demanded a sum of Rs 9,000 as bribe. Since the investigation is at a preliminary stage, he opposed grant of bail to the petitioner. Taking note of the fact that the petitioner is a public servant and that there is no possibility of him absconding from prosecution, Justice G Chandrasekharan granted bail to the petitioner by directing him to appear before the concerned police everyday at 10.30am until further orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tangedco-official-held-in-bribe-case-gets-bail/articleshow/82135517.cms||---

Commuters have urged the authorities concerned to nip the problem in the bud and prevent parking chaos on the stretches.Smart road was introduced in Masi street at a cost of Rs 47 crore along with facilities such as underground drainage, storm water drains and provision for ducting of cables under the surface. Instead of bitumen road, the civic body introduced cement road, which can last longer and does not require frequent maintenance. The project was completed a couple of weeks ago as per the schedule although there were disruptions due to Covid-19 related lockdown and Diwali shopping.Abdul Rafiq, a regular commuter, said that the stretches look wider after the cement road was introduced, but vehicles are allowed to park up to half the width of the roads, resulting in traffic bottleneck during peak hours. “Police and corporation officials should ensure that vehicles are parked only in the space provided for the purpose. Bikers resort to double parking. Cars and light commercial vehicles are parked next to the bikes, thereby leaving little space for vehicular movement,” he said.P S Pandian, a social activist said there is no point in enforcing strict measures after letting the people cultivate the habit of haphazard parking. Enforcement should begin from the start so that traders and vehicle owners comply. “Public address systems and CCTVs can be installed at regular intervals. The vehicle owners can be cautioned by constantly checking the visuals. Violators can be captured on camera and made to cough up fine amounts. There would not be any need for traffic police to keep on walking to monitor the situation,” he said.A traffic police official said that they continuously monitor Masi streets to streamline parking, but people are not cooperative. Haphazard parking takes place at one end of the street, when the police go to check the other end. Action against parking violations will be ramped up further in coming days,he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/parking-chaos-in-newly-laid-masi-streets/articleshow/82135519.cms||V Devanathan

Banana leaf bundles which were expected to sell for Rs 800 or more are now selling for Rs 300 or less.The temple festival season which is followed by marriage season increases the demand for banana leaves from April to mid July every year, and it is the season that farmers cultivating plantains for leaves make the most. K Pandi, of Sivaganga, said that banana plants cultivated for the purpose of harvesting leaves alone are usually saplings that are allowed to grow around a mother plant.Light rains, like what the region has been experiencing for the past one week, has improved the quality of leaves and also resulted in huge supply to the vegetable market, said Madurai Central Vegetable Market Association president P S Murugan. “If the festivals and marriages had been on, a bundle of 200 leaves would have sold for not less than Rs 800 this season, but on Sunday they sold for Rs 100 to Rs 300.”“The Madurai market has about 40 shops dealing in banana leaves and bananas alone. Each of these shops received about 100 bundles of leaves on Sunday and with the lack of demand the prices fell,” said wholesale merchant Kamatchi.Hotels are the major source of income for these banana leaf traders as their supply is always regular. “Even for the Pongal festival, a bundle of five leaves sold for Rs 25 to Rs 30, but today it was Rs 10 for five, which is very bad in terms of income,” said K Mangalam, a trader in a farmers market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/price-of-banana-leaves-crashes-by-more-than-60/articleshow/82135521.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Powai-Bhandup civic ward tightens rules, says no shopping after noon||MUMBAI: Crowding in public places has prompted at least one civic ward in the city to further tighten restrictions on shopping and movement. The BMC's S Ward, one of the largest, areawise, in the city and spread over Powai, Bhandup and Kanjurmarg, has issued a circular saying essential shops will only be allowed to remain open from 8am to 12 noon to ensure crowding can be prevented and the spread of Coronavirus contained. The only exemption to the rule is for medical shops which can stay open through the day. The decision was taken after corporators and MLAs warned of a likely surge in cases due to crowds and queues in different areas. Some state ministers had warned in recent days that measures to curb spread of Covid-19 may have to be tightened if public movement was not restricted. “There is a lot of crowding at these shops throughout the day. There was a demand from the local corporators and MLAs, so we issued this circular. However all medical stores will remain open round the clock. However they will be allowed to offer home delivery and online delivery will be allowed,” said Vibhas Achrekar, Assistant Municipal Commissioner, S Ward. The order, effective till April 30, will apply to roadside fruit and vegetable vendors, many of whom line narrow interior streets. Officials said in the S ward many essential shops that are allowed to remain open are located close to each other which was leading to massive crowding of people. In some locations like Powai, there are long queues outside supermarkets too in the evenings, and then people step out to walk at the same time. Officials said many residents were using the excuse to go out to buy essential items and moving from one place to another and said the restrictions would ensure people get their essential items home delivered if they want items after 12 noon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-powai-bhandup-civic-ward-tightens-rules-says-no-shopping-after-noon/articleshow/82135109.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

A division bench of Justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi was hearing a public interest litigation filed by G Chinnadurai, a retired postal department employee.The petitioner said under the scheme, 10% of the pay and dearness allowance were recovered from the employees’ salary and the government made an equal contribution. In 2019, the government’s contribution was increased to 14%. He said the contributions are invested in markets and the fund is managed by the pension fund regulatory and development authority. Since the market would decide the monthly pension that will accrue to the employee, there was no assured pension. Pensioners were suffering economically due to the implications of the scheme. Hence he moved HC Madurai bench seeking to ensure that employees get minimum assured pension no less than that of 50% of their last drawn salary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-in-hc-for-minimum-assured-pension/articleshow/82135518.cms||---
---||Lucknow||UP govt asks police to check illegal sale of Covid drugs||LUCKNOW: To check black-marketing, hoarding and overcharging of Remdesivir and other drugs used in treatment of critical Covid-19 patients, the state government has directed the police department to adopt zero-tolerance policy towards such illegal activities. “It is a crime against humanity and no one indulging in hoarding and black-marketing of Covid-19 medicines should be spared. Police must have a zero-tolerance policy towards such activities. Action taken by the police must instill fear in the minds of culprits,” the CM said. Recently, STF busted a gang which had hoarded as many as 265 Remdesivir vials in Kanpur. Three persons – Sachin Kumar, Mohan Soni and Prashant Shukla – were arrested and booked under the National Security Act (NSA). They were selling the drug for Rs 4,000 thus earnings more than Rs 10 lakh. “Following the CM’s directives, UP special task force (UP STF) and district police are conducting extensive drives to check black-marketing and hoarding of essential Covid-19 drugs,” additional director general of police, law and order, Prashant Kumar said. “No illegal activity will be tolerated in this time of crisis and will invite strict punishment. The state government is fully committed to facilitating easy availability of vials and other Covid-19 medicines to people. Various agencies have been deployed to check illegal sale of medicines,” he added. “Remdesivir is a key medicine used in the treatment of serious Covid-19 patients. Taking advantage of rising demand, some people are selling vials at high prices,” an official said. A home department official said despite the availability of eight essential drugs, including Remdesivir in abundant quantities in the state, illegal sale was a cause for concern. “The government has directed the authorities to verify the stock and take immediate action against black-marketing, hoarding and overcharging,” he said. To strengthen the process, authorities have been urged to instruct enforcement staff to keep strict vigil at sensitive places and take swift action by conducting raids and special drives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-asks-police-to-check-illegal-sale-of-corona-drugs/articleshow/82135089.cms||---

Amandeep Singh, executive engineer, Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), Kharar, said they had to shut five feeders to carry out the repair work. The traffic police closed vehicular traffic on the section for the day. In the evening, traffic was restored on one side of the road. One of the poles that came down was mounted with a transformer. Singh said a major tragedy was averted as the driver could have been electrocuted if the high tension wires had fallen on his vehicle. Police have booked the driver but are yet to arrest him.

The master plan will address the challenges faced by the plant in the treatment of solid waste, clearing of legacy waste and curbing groundwater pollution. According to the sources with Kochi Corporation, the local body will start preparing the master plan once the restrictions as part of the code of conduct are lifted. “We are planning to conduct a scientific survey and earmark holdings which can be used for solid waste treatment. We have also a plan to set up biogas plants at Brahmapuram,” a source with the corporation said. The solid waste treatment plant at Brahmapuram, set up more than one-and-a-half decades ago, has been functioning from a dilapidated building. It is on the brink of collapse while the machines in the plant have worn out. “We will be constructing a new building to house the plant and will procure new machines to increase the efficiency of the plant,” the source added. “Besides, there is a plan for setting up a medical waste treatment plant by Indian Medical Association (IMA). The government has already asked the corporation to handover five acres to IMA. All these aspects will be considered while preparing the master plan,” the source said. The frequent fire outbreaks are a source of concern and steps will be taken to widen the approach roads so that fire fighting vehicles can easily reach the premises of the plant. Clearing of legacy waste is another issue that will be addressed. “There is a proposal for bio-mining legacy waste. It will have to be discussed by the standing committees. It should also get the clearance of the corporation council. A decision regarding the clearing of the legacy waste can be taken only after detailed discussions,” said the source. Beautification of the plant premises also will be a part of the master plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/master-plan-for-revamp-plant-to-get-new-building-machinery/articleshow/82133356.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

As the promises to make immediate repairs on the seawalls remain only on papers, the residents have decided to strengthen protests in the coastal hamlet. They said the works need to be completed on a war footing as flooding and erosion are expected to hit the coast with the advent of monsoons in mid-May. The government had allotted Rs 15 crore for the repair of the seawall last year and the irrigation department had initiated the tendering. However, there were no takers for the contracts. With the election results due and a new government set to take charge, the projects are likely to be delayed further. Residents fear that if the works are not completed before the monsoons, they will face a tough time. A series of protests were held by Kerala Region Latin Catholic Council (KRLCC) and Care Chellanam, an association of residents and coastal protection activists in the village, seeking immediate repair of the seawall before the onset of monsoon. “When they began the tendering process, we thought the works would be completed before the monsoons. However, now it seems unlikely. As the existing seawall has completely broken up in several places, the sea flooding will be much more severe this time. The district collector must intervene in the issue and speed up the process,” said Jinson Veluthamannungal, coordinator, Care Chellanam. Tendering were started for 10 projects of seawall repair at various places along the coastline from South Chellanam to Saudi. “Usually, geobags are placed along the coast as a temporary relief and this time even that also had not happened yet. There is no use in placing the geobags after the flooding begins as the waves would wash them away. Hence, the authorities have to do it now before the monsoons. Last year, Chellanam witnessed one of the worst sea erosions since Ockhi cyclone. With the pandemic’s second wave hitting hard, moving to temporary relief camps in the wake of flooding will be a nightmare,” Jinson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/chellanam-residents-to-protest-broken-promises/articleshow/82133367.cms||---

That will help the state perform more pathogen confirmatory tests, particularly level 3 and 4, which link a pathogen with a disease. With improved infrastructure, such tests can be carried out across districts and small towns for the speedy detection of both known and unknown pathogens. The Covid surge forced the state government to deploy 19 RT-PCR machines for diagnosing the infection in districts and talukas. There an estimated 7 diagnostic laboratories for a lakh of population in the state. But the mere deployment of RT-PCR machines won’t be enough. Building a pool of capable human resources —microbiologists, virologists, and pathologists — is the need of the hour. A study by a team of public health experts published in 2019, just before the Covid pandemic hit Gujarat, reveals the deficiency in the diagnostic capability of private and public laboratories. The labs, the study noted, were predominantly engaged in conducting analyses based on rapid diagnostic kits, rather than in performing confirmatory tests. The team consisted of experts from IIPH-Gandhinagar, the department of biotechnology of Ahmedabad’s St Xavier’s College, and Yale School of Forestry and Environment Studies. The team analyzed 4,293 labs in the state, 1,765 public and 2,528 private. Strikingly, 94% of the lab effectiveness lay in rapid diagnostic tests (level 1 and 2) which are essentially screening tests. Also, level 3 confirmatory testing effectiveness, through RT-PCR and culture, was seen in only 4% of private and 36% of public labs. “More than half of the private lab effectiveness was located in eight Tier 1 cities of Gujarat. Level 3 confirmatory testing effectiveness was seen only in Tier 1 and 2 towns of Gujarat,” said the research. The research team was made up of Veena Iyer, Nandini Choudhury, Ajit Rajiva, Susanna Abraham Cottagiri, Ayushi Sharma, and Dileep Mavalankar. The research said that nearly 80% of the lab effectiveness was in the private sector, in level 2 rapid diagnostic testing. “Our labs should not only be capable of performing diagnostic confirmatory tests for both viral and bacterial diseases in every district, but a few labs should also specialize in detecting unknown pathogens, just like the CDC lab in the US,” said Iyer of IIPH-Gandhinagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarats-path-labs-need-urgent-upgrade/articleshow/82134400.cms||---

It had initiated discussions in this regard in 2016, and in 2019 even announced plans to set up infertility treatment facilities in Madurai, Coimbatore and Kilpauk medical college hospitals. However, according to a reply received by women’s health expert and activist A Veronica Mary to an RTI petition, none of the government hospitals has infertility treatment facilities at present. In 2018, she had filed a petition before the Madurai bench of the high court seeking to establish such centres in government hospitals for the benefit of the poor. It was to know the status of the action taken that she filed the RTI petition. The government had set up the Rs 50 crore CEmONC - Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Newborn care Services Centre at Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai a few years ago with facilities for high-end treatment for gynaecology and obstetrics. However, if facilities like PGD-IVF, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), morphologically selected sperm injection (IMSI), laser hatching, PGD sperm bank, egg bank, embryo bank, time lapse, fibroid clinic and laparoscopic surgery are established here, it would help thousands of couples from the economically poorer sections. Veronica says the infertility treatment industry is worth Rs 1,830 crore now which is expected to go up to Rs 5,000 crore by 2023. ``AIIMs in New Delhi started infertility treatment way back in 2007, and Karnataka and Kerala in government hospitals in 2019, I do not know why Tamil Nadu has not done it,’’ she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/rti-plea-finds-not-one-mch-still-has-infertility-treatment/articleshow/82135522.cms||---

Schools, also reiterated that practical exams can be safely conducted and completed.“It is impossible to hold the board exams now safely considering how cases are rising. Even if it was conducted as scheduled, many students may not turn up. Postponement was expected and ideally the exams should be conducted by June or July before competitive exams like NEET,” said M Arumugam, state president, Federation of Private School Associations (FePSA). He also added that conducting practical exams will not be an issue since only very limited number of students will come to school and the exams are being conducted only at individual school levels.Teachers and students are also hoping that postponement helps give room for better preparation in a year hit by Covid-19 pandemic. “It’s a great relief for all students. We are also thankful that the exams were postponed and not cancelled. With some physical classes conducted for at least a few weeks, we have the chance to prepare better for the exams,” said K Srividhya, a Class XII student. S Shanthi, Class XII physics teacher, on the other hand, said that with all lessons now completed, students would be able to prepare from home. “Students have already been revising the lessons only in most schools. With teachers running through all portions in physical classes in the last few weeks, students can now focus on learning by themselves. Doubts can be cleared over the phone,” she added.Madurai district chief educational officer had instructed all school staff to function only for five week days between Monday to Friday. He had also directed to declare study holidays for all Class XII students starting Monday till the board exams begin and allow only those giving their practical exams to come to school on the particular day. For classes I to IX, headmasters and block educational officers have been directed to ensure distribution of workbooks and bridge course material for students as soon as possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/relief-over-postponement-of-class-xii-board-exams/articleshow/82135525.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

Investigating officer of the case, inspector Mahendra Pratap Singh said the remand of Rajanath Yadav began on Saturday and will end on Monday. “We will take Rajanath to Mau on Monday for further questioning and finding evidence,” he added.

---||Delhi||Delhi halts, Covid doesn’t: Positivity rate at 30%||NEW DELHI: With the “fourth wave” of Covid-19 showing no signs of abating, most Delhiites complied with the weekend curfew. Just like a day earlier, the roads were deserted on Sunday as markets were shut and people largely remained indoors. Those who ventured out were mostly people needing to travel for essential services or requirements. The curfew, however, hit the vaccination drive with only 67,448 people turning up on Saturday to get the jab. Last Saturday, when there was no curfew, as many as 1,04,862 had got inoculated. The vaccination figures for Sunday will be known on Monday because the vaccination is now happening 24x7 in Delhi. The government had allowed travel for vaccination on the production of an e-pass. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the citizens were cooperating with the government. “I would like to thank the people of Delhi from the bottom of my heart for coming together to fight this Covid-19 pandemic,” the CM said at a press conference. The government kept a close watch on the adherence to the regulations as Sunday sees a lot of people going out to parks and other public places. Besides Delhi Police, teams from the district administration were stationed at sensitive places to ensure that the guidelines were followed. The markets, which usually brim with activity on weekends, also did not report any flow of customers. Those indulging in non-essential movements were fined and, in some cases, such people were also booked. The weekend curfew started from Friday 10pm and continued till 5am on Monday during which all non-essential movement of individuals was prohibited. The government had announced a curfew only for the current weekend and a decision about the next weekend will be taken later. Like on Saturday, bus terminals and railway stations, however, continued to see movement of people engaged in interstate travel. People dealing in essential services were seen travelling in Delhi Metro. However, none of the public transport services saw any crowding. Chamber of Trader and Industry convener Brijesh Goyal said like usual markets would open from Monday. “The markets will follow all the guidelines issued by the Delhi government,” Goyal added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-halts-covid-doesnt-positivity-rate-at-30/articleshow/82134245.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Pune||Hospitals reel as shortage of trained nurses hits hard||Pune: Hospitals in the city are facing an acute shortage of nursing staff after many took up offers in their native states and abroad for lucrative pay packages.Workload in the Covid-19 pandemic has increased and hospitals have upped their bed capacity to accommodate more patients, stretching the nursing staff to the limits. Many hospitals said earlier one nurse managed 5-6 patients, but now it is 15 patients. Similarly, if the ratio for ICU beds was one nurse per bed, it is now three beds per staff. Abrarali Dalal, chief operating officer in Sahyadri Hospitals, said their units were full just like the last year’s. “There is a global shortage of nursing staff. Indian nurses are getting lucrative offers, especially from the Gulf countries. Fresh graduates are not available as colleges have not held exams or have delayed the results during the pandemic. There is a shortage of senior nursing staff to cope with the sudden increase in patients. Nurses are now working almost beyond their capacities,” he added.Noble Hospital said they need over 400 nurses but have 235. Most are from other states and have gone back home or abroad, some switched to the jumbo facilities while 30 went into government health services. “Some nurses stopped coming after the March salary. We have complained to the police station that 25 nurses have left without any intimation and don’t take our calls. The government is asking us to increase the beds, but where is the manpower? We have told senior doctors and consultants to do ward duty which is not their job profile. Attrition in nurses affects us the most because about 70% of the work when a patient is admitted in the hospital is done by hem,” executive director H K Sale said. Lokmanya Hospital, Chinchwad has doubled the salaries during the pandemic but it is still hard to retain them. “If earlier we had one nurse per patient on a ventilator, now we are forced to have one nurse for 2-3 patients on a ventilator. Since there is more probability of healthcare workers contracting the virus, they are leaving for their native places because they feel that even if they test positive, they should be near their loved ones rather than staying in isolation in an unknown place,” COO Shrikrishna Joshi said. They have increased operational beds for Covid patients to 150, but the nursing staff strength has not gone up. Earlier a nurse would care for six patients, now it is 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hospitals-reel-as-shortage-of-trained-nurses-hits-hard/articleshow/82134269.cms||Ardhra Nair

The crucial elections to the Shia Board is scheduled for Tuesday. Waseem Rizvi’s name figures in the list of candidates from the mutawali quota in the notification (dated April 17, 2021) issued by special secretary to UP government and election officer for Shia Waqf Board, Ashok Kumar. After Syed Zafar Rizvi withdrew his nomination on Sunday, six candidates are now in the fray, said CEO, Shia Waqf Board, Naseer Hasan. Along with Rizvi, others in the list include Ashfaq Hussain Zia from Faizabad, Syed Musharraf Hussain Rizvi from Unnao, Syed Mujahid Hussain Naqvi from Barabanki, Syed Asim Rizvi and Syed Faizi (both from Lucknow). The Shia Board, which is scheduled to be constituted on April 20 through an electoral process, will have majority nominated members. Only two members will be elected from mutawalli quota. As there are no Shia sitting parliamentarians from Uttar Pradesh, former MPs will become eligible to be members from MP quota. Three former Congress MPs Begum Noor Bano, Akhtar Hussain Rizvi and Syed Sibte Razi, minister for minorities affairs Mohsin Raza and BJP MLC Buqqal Nawab are in the fray for membership from MP/MLA quota. Likewise, since there are no Shia MLAs from Uttar Pradesh, sitting MLCs will fill up the MLA/MLC quota. Mohsin Raza and Buqqal Nawab both are BJP MLCs. Talking to TOI, chief executive officer of Shia Waqf Board Naseer Hasan said, “If there are no eligible candidates from the prescribed categories, the state government can nominate to complete the quorum. It can nominate any former MP or former MLA of Shia community to complete MP/MLA categories and nominate Shia lawyers to complete the quorum in the absence of a Shia member from the Bar Council.” UP minister for minorities affairs Mohsin Raza, said, “we will create a clean, non-controversial waqf board. The Board coffers are empty and we will try to mobilise resources and work for the community’s welfare.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/shia-board-polls-waseem-rizvi-seeks-membership/articleshow/82135143.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

---||Delhi||Running out of beds and oxygen: Delhi CM writes to PM Narendra Modi, calls up Amit Shah||NEW DELHI: On a day Delhi reported 25,462 Covid cases and 161 fresh deaths, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and called up home minister Amit Shah to apprise them of the grim situation and communicated the urgent need to augment beds and oxygen supplies. The CM said the city had less than 100 ICU beds vacant and the situation was worsening every moment. In his letter to the Prime Minister, Kejriwal made an urgent request to increase the number of beds reserved for Covid-19 patients in central government hospitals from the existing 1,800 to 7,000. The chief minister underlined that the Covid positivity rate was growing at a rapid pace, touching nearly 30% on Sunday, from 24% a day before. “A large number of patients are being admitted to hospitals and we are falling short of ICU beds. In Delhi, we are now left with less than 100 ICU beds. We are falling short of oxygen as well. Last night, a private hospital told us that the shortage was so severe that they just about managed to prevent a tragedy. We have been in touch with the Centre, and have asked for aid, which we are getting; and for that, we’d like to thank them,” Kejriwal later said at a press conference. Kejriwal also wrote that the city was in immediate need of oxygen and requested that the number of ICU beds being set up by DRDO in Delhi be increased to 1,000 from the current 500. The chief minister, later in the day, wrote to Union minister Piyush Goyal too, demanding an uninterrupted supply of 700 MT of oxygen to Delhi and the restoration of 140 MT oxygen supply to INOX, one of the major suppliers to various hospitals of Delhi. “Further, the output of M/s INOX, one of the major suppliers to various hospitals of Delhi, has been largely diverted to other states. At this critical juncture, it will not be possible for hospitals to enter into contractual arrangements with new suppliers who are now being assigned to Delhi. This disruption is already starting to cause critical shortages (sic),” Kejriwal wrote. Earlier, pointing to the desperate situation, the chief minister had tweeted: “Delhi facing acute shortage of oxygen. In view of sharply increasing cases, Delhi needs much more than normal supply. Rather than increasing supply, our normal supply has been sharply reduced and Delhi’s quota has been diverted to other states.

In some hospitals, oxygen is sufficient only for 10-12 hours, while others have stock for 24-32 hours,” Sisodia said on Sunday.Sisodia, along with health minister Satyendar Jain, visited Satyawadi Raja Harish Chandra Hospital, Burari Hospital, Radha Soami Satsang Beas and DRDO Covid Care Centre to take stock of the situation.CM Arvind Kejriwal, too, visited Yamuna Sports Complex and Commonwealth Games Village to inspect the preparations. “In Yamuna Sports Complex and Commonwealth Games Village, we are arranging 500 beds each. We are also putting up 100 beds at a Delhi government school. We are trying to install the maximum number of oxygen beds across Delhi. We hope that 250 Covid beds at the Covid Care Centre set up by DRDO will become operational from Monday. Around 1,400-2,000 additional beds will become available from Monday,” Kejriwal said.“We do not want a situation that we saw in other cities and countries — patients should not be lying in the corridors or on roads after being denied medical help. We should be able to arrange beds, oxygen and medicines for the treatment of patients in Delhi,” the CM said. Sisodia stated that 5,000 oxygen beds will be ready in Delhi in the next few days. Around 500 oxygen beds will get operational at Radha Soami Satsang Beas from Tuesday. The DRDO facility has been created in five days and will admit critical Covid patients. The centre has 500 ventilator-equipped ICU beds, of which 250 will be ready from Monday.The oxygen plant will start functioning in Delhi in the next two days, but due to higher consumption than usual, the supply allocated to Delhi is falling significantly, Sisodia said, adding that people of Delhi need to be vigilant. He emphatically stated that the Delhi government is conducting the maximum number of tests in the entire country and is keeping all the data in front of everyone with absolute transparency.“Some people choose to stay admitted to the hospital despite getting a go-ahead from doctors for discharge,” said Jain, appealing to them to leave the beds for more critical patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sisodia-flags-acute-shortage-of-oxygen-in-city-hospitals/articleshow/82134326.cms||AlokKNMishra

Ali, a native of Balrampur district in UP, had gone missing after the vehicle in which he was travelling with a driver fell into Drass river from Zojila-Kargil-Leh road. After working as a junior engineer at Delhi Development Authority, Subhan joined BRO in January 2020 and got his first posting in Leh. Passing an order recently, the bench of Justice Manmohan and Justice Asha Menon directed the government to file a counter affidavit within four weeks and listed the matter for hearing on July 28. During the hearing of petition filed by Ali’s father Ramzan Ali, the petitioner’s counsel Bhanu Pratap said the government and BRO “have neither paid any salary nor provided the petitioner’s family with any financial assistance”. He also prayed “for payment of salary on the ground that petitioner is only missing as of now”. Central government standing counsel Bhagvan Swarup Shukla said “as soon as documents signed by the petitioner’s wife are received, she shall be released family pension as well as terminal benefits”. Ali’s family had moved the Delhi High Court on March 27, 2021, to seek financial assistance. A unit of the Army and National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) were formed to trace the bodies of Ali but failed. In July last year, Balrampur police had also formed a special investigation team of three members to search for the missing IES officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/provide-fin-aid-to-missing-bro-officers-family-delhi-hc-to-govt/articleshow/82135190.cms||---

The civic body has procured 55 ambulances for this service, which will be operated through a call centre. A total of 101 ambulances will now be available for patients in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits. A PMC official said a dedicated 108 line had been set up for the ambulance service. However, as citizens were complaining about not getting through, one more control room was set up. Citizens can also call on 9689939381 to avail the service. The PMC’s vehicle department is coordinating the ambulances. The civic administration has also sought assistance from the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) to make buses or other vehicles available for transporting patients as well as dead bodies. “The ambulances will be of different types, including those with and without oxygen supply. The ambulances will also be used for transporting patients other than Covid-19 patients as well”, a senior PMC official said. According to the civic data, out of the 101 ambulances, 78 will be used to ferry patients, while 23 will ferry dead bodies. As many as 63 ambulances will have oxygen supply, the civic data added. Ambulance drivers have been taking the necessary precautions such as regulary washing and sanitising their hands, following the necessary safety protocols on reaching home, among others.

---||Lucknow||UP panchayat polls Phase 2: Spotlight on Mulayam Singh Yadav's belt, PM constituency||LUCKNOW: As the four-phased panchayat poll heads to the second round on Monday, the spotlight will be on the Yadav belt comprising districts of Etawah and Mainpuri, the home turf and parliamentary constituency of SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav; Azamgarh, the parliamentary seat of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav; Kannauj and Badaun, the former parliamentary constituencies of Akhilesh’s wife Dimple Yadav and cousin Dharmendra Yadav. The second phase is also significant as it includes Varanasi, the parliamentary constituency of PM Narendra Modi and state capital Lucknow. The second phase, being held amid a steep surge in Covid cases, will witness a keen contest in 20 districts, including those in the politically volatile west UP region — Amroha, Baghpat, Bijnor and Muzzaffarnagar. These districts, experts say, record heavy polling and could potentially tip the overall voting percentage. The other districts which would go to poll include Etah, Gonda, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Chitrakoot, Pratapgarh, Maharajganj, Lakhimpur Kheri, Lalitpur and Sultanpur. In all, there will be 11,483 candidates in fray for 787 zila panchayats wards, 85,231 candidates for 19,653 kshetra panchayat wards and 1,21,908 candidates in 14,897 gram panchayats. At least 3.23 crore voters will exercise their franchise in 52,620 polling booths. A keen contest brews in Mainpuri where Mulayam’s niece and Samajwadi Party leader Sandhya Yadav switched to the saffron camp and is contesting from Ghiror ward number 18 as a BJP candidate. Sandhya, elder sister of Dharmendra Yadav, was the sitting zila panchayat chairman of Mainpuri. She was reportedly peeved with a section of SP leadership, which orchestrated a no-confidence motion against her in 2017. Since then she has been hobnobbing with BJP ranks. Mainpuri has 30 zila panchayat wards for which 367 candidates are in fray. Election Commission records show Azamgarh, comprising a substantial Muslim population, has the highest number of 1,858 gram panchayats, 84 zila panchayat wards and 2,104 kshetra panchayat wards. The district has over 37 lakh voters who will be polling in 6229 polling stations. After Azamgarh it is Lakhimpur Kheri with 27 lakh voters, followed by Gonda (26.6 lakh) and Pratapgarh (26.59 lakh). Lakhimpur Kheri has 72 zila panchayat wards and 1,165 gram panchayat, while Gonda has 65 zila panchayat wards and 1205 gram panchayats. Panchayat elections would also feel the grassroots pulse in PM Modi’s constituency of Varanasi, which has 40 zila panchayat wards, 1,007 kshetra panchayat and 694 gram panchayats. The district would see more than 17.5 lakh voters exercising their franchise in 2,592 polling stations. Likewise, Lucknow will see an electoral battle in 25 zila panchayat wards, 628 kshetra panchayat wards and 494 gram panchayats. The district has 10.6 lakh voters, who will be casting their votes in 1,775 polling stations. Gautam Buddh Nagar in the national capital region, has the lowest number of rural local bodies – five zila panchayat wards, 119 kshetra panchayats and only 88 gram panchayats. The district comprises a little over 2.08 lakh voters only.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rural-polls-round-2-spotlight-on-yadav-belt-pm-constituency/articleshow/82135198.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Mumbai||Four airlines face FIR for ‘flouting norms’ on Maharashtra-Delhi route||The Delhi government on Sunday asked the Delhi police to lodge an FIR against four airlines — IndiGo, Vistara, SpiceJet and AirAsia India — for flouting the rule of flying in people from Maharastra to the capital with negative RT-PCR report. Airlines, on their part, said they adhere to all norms and had not received any FIR till Sunday evening. “…it has been observed that a large number of passengers fly from Maharashtra to Delhi without a valid RT-PCR report... written to SHO of IGI Airport to lodge FIRs against four flights (possibly one each by) Indigo, Spice Jet, Vistara and Air Asia… for carrying passengers from Maharashtra without valid RT-PCR tests,” the Delhi government said in a statement on Sunday. This action has been sought under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. Delhi requires people flying in from Maharashtra to have a negative RT-PCR report from a test done within 72 hours of departure, and those coming without it must get quarantined for 14 days. States have different requirement in terms of RT-PCR reports and quarantine for those coming from other states. An IndiGo spokesperson said the airline has not “received any FIR against it…” AirAsia India said in a statement it is in “compliance with guidelines and protocols issued by the respective regulatory bodies… we have not received any information from any authority on this matter [FIR].” Comments from Vistara and SpiceJet are awaited. In this ever-evolving pandemic situation, airlines have had their own issues with RT-PCR test reports. In the past few months, there have been several instances of airlines globally being barred from flying to certain places for bringing in passengers with negative reports who test positive on arrival. This has happened with Indian carriers too in places like UAE and Hong Kong. Tamil Nadu had barred a UAE budget carrier for flying in passengers for some days after a person flew in with a negative report but was positive. Since RT-PCR tests need to be undertaken 3-4 days before departure, there is a possibility of passengers getting infected sometime after giving nasal swab samples. This discrepancy pin test report and actual Covid status was found to be very high with reports from certain labs in India. After that UAE, for instance, barred airlines from flying people from India with reports from some labs here. The Emirates site says “If you are flying from India, Pakistan, Nigeria or Bangladesh, you must get your certificate from one of the labs listed in the designated laboratories document to be accepted on the flight (to Dubai).” An airline official said: “We have given strict instructions to check-in staff to follow entry requirements of all states. If someone gives a forged test report or if someone with a negative report tests positive on arrival, what can we do? The last thing we want to do is wilfully defy rules and run foul of the law also.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/4-airlines-face-fir-for-flouting-norms-on-maharashtra-delhi-route/articleshow/82135203.cms||Saurabh Sinha

The CM’s directive came a day after Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) offered to set up 10 oxygen plants in the state amidst a steep surge in Covid cases. Alarmed by the loss of lives in a hospital fire in Chhattisgarh on Sunday, Yogi directed authorities to immediately conduct an inspection of fire safety equipment in hospitals. The CM, who presided over a review meeting through video conference from his official residence, asked officials to swiftly procure oxygen cylinders for dedicated Covid hospitals. He said, health authorities should act swiftly after assessing the 15-day demand for oxygen. The CM specifically asked medical education minister Suresh Khanna to monitor oxygen supply in the state. He also directed the food and drug administration and health department to ensure that Corona patients in home isolation don’t face shortage of medicines. He asked the FDA control room to keep a round-the-clock vigil on Remdesivir stock and directed medical and health minister Jai Pratap Singh to ensure the supply chain of Remdesivir and other medicines are not choked. At the same time, he said, the capacity of ICU and isolation beds should be doubled in worst-affected districts, including Lucknow, Prayagraj, Moradabad, Jhansi and Kanpur. Yogi said, facilities should be upgraded in Kanpur’s GSV Medical College, Rama Medical College and Narayan Medical College. Sanitisation and fogging drive should be carried out on a war footing during weekend lockdowns and screening of passengers arriving from other states be conducted rigorously, he said. Virus carriers should be quarantined at centres with adequate facilities, he added. “We should go full throttle on RTPCR tests with help of government and authorised private laboratories,” the CM said. He also asked authorities to intensify the drive to restrict people from assembling in large numbers and people coming to markets should wear masks and gloves. He said, strict action, including slapping of Rs 1000 fine should be taken on those not wearing masks. The CM Helpline is proving to be helpful for those infected with coronavirus in the state. Of 8,16,962 people who contacted the CM Helpline through its toll-free number 1076, it has addressed issues of 8,13,930 people till date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ensure-36-hr-oxygen-buffer-in-hosps-yogi/articleshow/82135200.cms||Pankaj Shah

Karade has been an ambulance driver for 15 years. He said that in the last year, he has seen things on job that he had never seen before. “I have deliberately sent my family to my village in the Baramati district, seeing the pandemic situation in Pune. I am dealing with so many patients each day and don’t want my family to get infected. The last two months have been a nightmare. I have wept many times after witnessing infected persons struggling to breathe and their anxious relatives continuously asking me to drive fast, praying to God and weeping continuously,” Karade told TOI. While Karade has managed to keep himself safe until now, he said he wasn’t going to go to his village to meet his family. “I miss them but I am required to be here. I should be away from my family and my village also, as I don’t want to risk even the slightest chance of infecting them. This second wave has taken a toll on us. These days I don’t get time to even eat. I am taking around 20 to 25 people to different hospitals each day. With shortage of beds in most of the hospitals, there have been times when I have driven to six to seven facilities with the patient and their family members,” Karade added. Karade, who lives in Hadapsar, said that his job had always been challenging, but since last year, it has been a whole new ball game. “There were a lot of doubts over the virus last year and we had to face incidents where people didn’t want to meet us at times thinking that we were carriers. A lot has changed since then. With the second wave being more vigorous than last year, the challenges have increased for us. Each time I drive, it is to save a life,” he said. Another ambulance driver Devaji Mane has been in the business for 15 years. He said he is fearless even during the current situation. Mane said, “When I offer the service of ferrying patients, they give me blessings and that is what keeps me motivated. That is also one reason why I am not infected with the disease, despite having patients in my ambulance throughout my duty hours.” He said that he has been taking all the safety precautions including sanitising, cleaning hands, following the safety protocols once he reaches home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/drivers-gauge-ways-to-stay-safe/articleshow/82134373.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Imposing further curbs, the state government also announced closure of all kinds of educational centres and anganwadi kendras and slashed the number of persons for marriages to 50 from 200. The move came after a meeting among the Mahagathbandhan constituents — JMM, Congress and RJD — around noon, a day after Hemant held a meeting with all political parties to get suggestions on lockdown and other to-do things. While JMM is demanding for a complete lockdown, its key ally, Congress is still not in favour of the lockdown with Oraon raising his objection to economic lockdown fearing issues of livelihood loss for poor and daily wage earners. He advised Hemant to consider sector-wise and rotational lockdown for shorter periods. Sources in the government told TOI that they are mulling ways to restrict movement of people to break the virus chain. “CM was of the view of exploring possibility of the efficiency of the lockdown on an hourly basis per day. Nothing is finalised but the government is trying to work out the best possible way to fight the virus and ensure people are least affected,” said a source, adding that the reason to shut all kinds of educational centres and exams is to prevent youths and children from getting infected. In a video message, Hemant said, “We have decided to cancel all examinations across all educational institutions and bodies with an immediate effect for the next one month. After a month, we shall take a call post evaluation of the situation. We shall decide on other restrictions gradually on the basis of the evolving situation.” Health minister Banna Gupta and finance minister Rameshwar Oraon attended Sunday’s meeting while RJD was represented by state labour minister Satyanand Bhokta. Hemant sounded concerned with the growing number of cases in the state and warned people to be highly vigilant. “Consider everyone who you meet with suspicion as he/she might be infected. Hence, I urge everyone, especially youths, to refrain from unnecessarily venturing out. If you do so, please wear a mask and follow safety protocols,” he said. Going by the current growth rate, the state health department has calculated around 35,000 cases in the state by April end. The skyrocketing numbers have already led to the crumbling of the health infrastructure in the state, causing rise in fatalities as a result of which chief minister had also shot off a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking help from the military and central paramilitary forces posted in the state to use their medical resources and infrastructure to overcome the deepening manpower crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-edu-institutes-to-shut-for-a-month-all-exams-cancelled/articleshow/82133790.cms||ASRP Mukesh

There are 12 TrueNat machines, including three in Sadar hospital and one in Bokaro General Hospital, in the district. The antigen testing kits are being used in public places. Although Dr Pathak did not mention when exactly the RT-PCR test, which is considered the gold standard for Covid diagnosis, will resume, sources said that government officials have asked the hospitals not to send the samples till the backlog is cleared. Bokaro mostly sends the samples to Patliputra Medical College in Dhanbad. According to sources, reports of more than 2,000 samples, which were sent around four days ago, are still pending. The decision to stop RT-PCR tests comes at a time when the Union government is asking states to ramp up testing for effective management of the Covid scenario. Bokaro, which has 850 active cases, is collecting 1,200 samples per day, the corresponding figure was 3,000 per day during the first wave.

The decision was taken by the Shashtri Market managing committee on April 15 and most of the panel members voted in favour of the lockdown,” Kishore Papneja, president of the committee, told TOI. There are 115 shops in Shastri Market which employs roughly 450 people. Shopkeeper Jaspreet Singh said, “We will undoubtedly incur losses because the marriage season is underway and there is Ramadan as well. But the well-being of ourselves, our family members and our staff is more important than money.” Another shop owner named Shyam Agarwal said, “Even money is of no use now for critically ill Covid patients are not getting beds in Ranchi despite shelling out lakhs of rupees. Besides, most of our employees come from suburbs such as Namkum, Ratu, Tupudana and other places. They can get infected during the commute and in turn, infect others at the shop, including the customers.” Following suit, traders at Lalji Hirjee Road also announced that they will shut their shops from 1 pm on Monday till April 25. With many businessmen already infected by the deadly virus, traders in Upper Bazar, the city’s biggest wholesale market, are also contemplating stringent measures. “A decision is likely to be taken in a couple of days,” said an Upper Bazar-based trader on anonymity. Ranchi is not alone. Even the traders in Pakur shut down their commercial establishments voluntarily on Sunday. “Nearly 1,300 shops across town were closed. A few had opened their shops but they closed it later. The shops were first closed voluntarily last Sunday (April 11),” Sanjiv Kumar Khatry, secretary of the Pakur Chamber of Commerce and Industries told TOI. Among the prominent markets closed in Pakur were Harindanga Bazar, Mal Pahari Road, Station Road, Mal Godown Road, Kalikapur and Main Road.

After the images and videos of passengers breaking through barricades at the Hatia railway station left administrative officials and the railways red faced, the officials sat in a huddle on Saturday evening to ensure the scenes do not repeat again. Last week, nearly 700 passengers, who were to arrive at Ranchi from Mumbai, pulled chains along the way and de-boarded to evade Covid-19 tests upon arrival. “There were barricades put up before each coach and teams of health workers were deployed outside each coach. To prevent chaos, RPF personnel were deployed outside every coach and passengers were asked to de-board one by one and were taken to the team of health workers for tests,” a senior official in the division said. On Friday, the division had deployed 30 RPF personnel to man the barricades. “We learnt from our mistakes. Today, we doubled our deployment and set up higher number of barricades,” the official added. Ranchi sub-divisional officer Utkarsh Gupta said 40 health workers were deployed at the Hatia railway station to test the incoming passengers. “This is going to be our standard procedure for screening the passengers of all special trains arriving at the Ranchi and Hatia railway stations,” Gupta told TOI. The passengers were put through rapid antigen tests. As per the data available with the administration, nearly 900 passengers de-boarded, of which 12 tested positive. “They were taken to Covid-19 isolation facility at Khelgaon,” Gupta said. But the divisional officials said 794 passengers were tested, of which 15 turned out to be positive. Meanwhile, Gupta said the administration has not received any directive for handling passengers who are arriving from Kumbh Mela in Prayag Raj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/12-migrants-from-maharashtra-test-ve-upon-arrival-at-hatia-station/articleshow/82133137.cms||Dhritiman Ray

---||Ranchi||‘Double mutant variant, UK strain lethal for youngsters’||Ranchi: The spread of the double mutant as well as the UK strain of coronavirus has taken a toll on the lungs of young patients in the state. According to health experts, the increasing rate of infection in the state was owing to the presence of the UK variant, whereas the double mutant strain aggravated the symptoms among patients. During the second wave, younger patients are getting affected in large numbers unlike the first wave. Last year, mostly the elderly and people with co-morbidities suffered when the outbreak was at its peak. As per the data from the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims), nearly 200 of the 350 Covid-19 patients currently under treatment at the hospital are between 20 to 40 years, and all of them have developed lungs infection after contracting the virus. Talking to TOI, a professor of critical care at Rims, Dr Pradeep Bhattacharya, said: “We conduct HRCT to analyse the anatomical damage of the lungs of a Covid-19 patient, while functional damage is assessed on the basis of the patient’s SpO2 levels. This time, the mortality rate among younger patients is high as the lungs are getting affected fast.” On being asked about the severity of the infection during the second wave, Dr Bhattacharya said: “We can realise the severity only from the fact that a young patient’s oxygen level is falling from 90 to 50 and below within 24 hours. We are not being able to save all the patients despite trying our best.” Dr Bhattacharya also expressed his concern over the spike in infection rate. He said that last year a positive person could infect three to four people, but this time around the number is hovering between eight to 12. “The mutant strains are responsible for the surge in cases. We are often getting five to six patients from the same family,” Dr Bhattacharya said. An assistant professor at Rims’s critical care department, Dr Saif Khan, said: “Last year, lungs usually got damaged after a prolonged infection. But, this time, the condition of the lungs is starting to deteriorate within two to three days. That is almost equal to the incubation period that the virus takes before showing symptoms.” On being asked how a patient in home isolation will ascertain the condition of their lungs, Dr Khan said: “Constant monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and pulse rate is necessary and if people in home isolation experience a dip in saturation levels they should immediately get themselves admitted to a hospital and get an HRCT done.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/double-mutant-variant-uk-strain-lethal-for-youngsters/articleshow/82134576.cms||Gaurav Pandey

He instructed the SEs to complete the transfers of junior and senior assistants within two days from April 22. Several employees in the power utility in almost all the divisions have been tested positive for Covid-19. While many of them have been admitted to different hospitals for treatment, a few are recovering in home isolation. “It is highly objectionable to take up transfers as Covid-19 is spreading among employees. We request the state government to intervene and suspend the CMD’s decision to execute the transfers,” said Ch Purushotham Rao, divisional secretary, AP Electricity Employees Union. According to information at least 25 staffers in CPDCL corporate office in Vijayawada tested positive in the last two weeks. This is 30 percent of the total strength of employees in the corporate office. Similarly, 18 employees were tested positive in CPDCL SE office in Guntur last week. About 15 employees have gone on leave due to suspicious symptoms of Covid-19. At least two DE and ADE rank officers were treated in ICU in different hospitals in the city. “Many more might be falling victims to the virus as nearly 150 people are working from a small building in Guntur SE office,” said a senior official. CPDCL CMD instructed the SEs to transfer all those completed five years of service in one place and three years of service in post. Earlier, only 30 per cent of the employees who completed five years of service were used to get transferred while the present circular insisted for transfer everyone who completed five years of service. Employees are worried over the CMD’s decision to take up the transfers as it would force gathering of about 300 to 400 people in each district headquarter. EPDCL and SPDCL have not taken a decision regarding the transfer of employees keeping in view of the Covid-19 second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/discom-staffers-urge-govt-to-halt-transfers/articleshow/82132779.cms||Samdani MN

These e-vehicles would come with a full charge range of 40 to 100 kilometres with three years’ annual maintenance. The amount can be repaid within 24 to 60 months with zero investment from the state government. State energy secretary Srikant Nagulapalli said that the New & Renewable Energy Development Corporation of AP Ltd (NREDCAP) shall be made authorised to operate the EMI scheme for providing electric vehicles to all government employees including cooperative societies, public sector undertakings and pensioners. “A special focus would be laid on village/ward secretariat staff and other low paid employees, who opt for this scheme voluntarily. A government order shall be issued soon in this regard,” said Srikant. Meanwhile, the Andhra Pradesh government is set to come out with an action plan for overall implementation of e-mobility to make the state a hub for e-vehicles. The state already released its EV policy, incentivising the stakeholders on both the supply and demand side. The government is allocating 500 to 1,000 acres of land for developing EV Parks with plug and play internal infrastructure, common facilities and necessary external infrastructure. About 50% financial assistance would be provided on fixed capital investment to developers of auto clusters and automotive suppliers manufacturing centres (ASMC) specific to EVs. Financial incentives would also be given to private charging stations, and hydrogen generation & refuelling infrastructure. Srikant added that the state government has already created a separate sub-category for electric vehicles and the electricity tariff is fixed at Rs 6.70 per unit without any demand charges to promote use of EVs. “EESL has already established 80 charging stations in Andhra Pradesh and supplied 300 e-cars to various government departments. Now the state government has decided to set up 400 more charging stations in 73 locations across the state to promote use of electric vehicles,” the energy secretary said. Vice-chairman and MD, NREDCAP, S Ramana Reddy said that EVs fare better than internal combustion engine vehicles in terms of enhanced energy security, reduced reliance on crude oil, better air quality and lower greenhouse gas emissions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/state-to-give-e-bikes-to-govt-employees-on-emi/articleshow/82132851.cms||---

The LMO would be transported by placing the tankers on flat wagons. According to the Railway officials, a green corridor would be created for fast movement of oxygen express trains. Andhra Pradesh has a medical oxygen production capacity of 200 metric tonnes a day. But distributors are currently placing indents for 60 to 70 metric tonnes. Andhra Pradesh has been supplying the medical oxygen to various other states, including Telangana. Due to restrictions of height of road over bridges and overhead equipment at certain locations, out of the various specifications of road tankers, the model of road tanker T 1618 with a height of 3320 mm was found feasible by the Railways to place it on flat wagons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vizag-to-send-medical-oxygen-to-maharashtra/articleshow/82132883.cms||---

---||Indore||Indore: Patients gasp for breath, politicians hold up O2 tanker for photo op||INDORE: A tanker carrying 30 tonnes of oxygen from Gujarat arrived in Covid-battered Indore on Saturday night. But while the city was counting its breaths, politicians made a media spectacle of it, holding it up for photo ops at two places before it could start unloading. This, despite CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s orders that oxygen tankers be given ambulance status and be escorted by police to ensure there is no hold-up. The tanker driver had set off from Jamnagar at 1am, stopping only once for lunch during the 700km journey. “I have not blinked all the way. We are aware of how important oxygen is during Covid times,” driver Shailendra Kushwah told TOI at 11.30pm on Saturday. He hadn’t expected to run into politicians carrying garlands, balloons and cameramen. The tanker was first stopped at Chandan Nagar Square by BJP workers, led by local president Gaurav Randive. He was soon joined by minister Tulsiram Silawat. A team of mediapersons, informed in advance, took photographs as politicians posed before the tanker and gave speeches. Soon, however, a team of administrative officials, led by collector Manish Singh, arrived and ushered the tanker on its way. When the tanker arrive at the oxygen plant at MR-10, BJP Lok Sabha MP Shankar Lalwani, and MLAs Ramesh Mendola and Akash Vijayvargiya were there to welcome it. It was decorated with balloons. A priest performed a pooja in the presence of the politicians before the nod was given to pipe off the oxygen. On being asked about the welcome, driver said, “We are here for the last two hours. It will take us another hour to unload the tanker.” Congress tore into BJP over this on Sunday. “BJP leaders in Indore celebrated the arrival of just one oxygen tanker while 10 people died in Shahdol due to lack of oxygen. This is the height of shamelessness,” said PCC spokesperson K K Mishra. BJP, however, claimed there was no delay in the tanker reaching the filling station. “The tanker was stopped only once, for five minutes, on Dhar Road and then it went directly to the filling station,” Gaurav Randive said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/patients-gasp-for-breath-netas-hold-up-o2-tanker-for-photo-op/articleshow/82136287.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||How these women built communities to aid mental health, well-being||Bengaluru: In the past year, many people have felt a deep sense of isolation and anxiety as the pandemic upended every area of normal life. A number of new communities on mental health and well-being are helping them navigate uncertainty and find emotional footing. Some initiatives are driving fresh thinking in the field by examining how societal factors influence how we feel. The Listeners Collective, founded by Ganga Nair, is a multidisciplinary group that supports healing journeys and encourages wide-ranging conversations on mental health and related research. The Burrow, started by Samira Philip, Anoushka Akhouri and Jyothis Thomas, is an online platform that seeks to make counselling more accessible. Jaskiran Gill’s Listening Inn is a peer support network, whose specially trained volunteers lend their ears to people searching for a safe space to share their struggles, joys or everyday experiences. Jaskiran quit her corporate job in 2015 and joined the social sector. The subject of mental health was always close to her heart and she became an active advocate. “When I said I want to raise awareness, the most common advice I got was: ‘Talk as much as you can’. But talking alone doesn’t work. To help someone, you must be a good listener,” she says. “Those who need support or a sympathetic ear are often wary of reaching out because friends or family members may pass judgements, assign labels or suggest quick fixes. It’s not that they have bad intentions; they lack understanding of mental health issues.” Jaskiran observed that comments like “be positive” or “it’s all in your mind” did more harm than good and that a more nuanced approach was required to engage people who bottled up their feelings. “The desire to help anyone who wants to be heard prompted me to start Listening Inn last year. It’s a community where trained listeners answer calls. They don’t intervene in problems, but enable the callers to get clarity about their emotions,” she explains. “People don’t call only to narrate their problems. They also describe positive developments. Social structures are so disconnected because of Covid-19 that many don’t find someone with whom they can share happiness.” Listening Inn has trained 60 volunteers, mostly women, and plans to increase the figure to 100 this month. It is on the team of the International Listening Association. People aged between 18 and 30 are the largest group of callers. “There are anxieties about education and jobs. Entrepreneurs whose business has suffered are unable to tell their families what they go through. College students want an outlet as they feel people shut them down without paying attention to what they are saying or experiencing,” she says. Ganga is a counselling psychologist with 10 years of experience. She founded The Listeners Collective with like-minded experts last year. “When we think of mental health, we view it as a very private or individualistic topic. So, the focus and burden of managing it fall on the individual. The common narrative is: you have a problem and you must sort yourself out. We rarely look at socioeconomic, sociopolitical or sociocultural factors that interact with one’s well-being. We don’t take a wider approach at intersectional length when we talk about the issue,” she says. “Bringing full appreciation of all these aspects to the therapy room, group sessions and mental health conversations was one of the motivations for starting this community.” Ganga believes that the impact of external factors should not be ruled out. “Let’s take the example of stress. Many see it as an individual’s inability to manage daily life or hurdles. They say: ‘Others don’t have a problem, only you do’. This is a distorted idea of mental health. Stress could be a function of economic hardship or workplace culture,” she says. Calling for a broader approach in therapy, she adds: “A practitioner could argue that they can only control things in front of them, i.e. the person in counselling. But this way, we are only teaching the person to adapt to or cope with systems that are unjust or problematic. This is not a long-term solution.” The Listeners Collective has developed a range of counselling programmes. It provides a therapeutic space to members of the LGBTQ+ community and has collaborated with ‘India Love Project’. Therapists Samira, Anoushka and Jyothis established The Burrow in 2020 after completing their MSc in counselling psychology at Christ College. “In March last year, we completed the final viva in the morning and the college shut in the afternoon because of the lockdown. We thought it would be a short lockdown. When things didn’t reopen, we discussed our career prospects and also observed that many people were distressed. We started an online platform to make counselling accessible to all,” says Samira. For the first few months, they provided free counselling. “Several people were facing financial problems because of Covid-19, so we offered pro bono services,” she says. People in the age group of 21-28 reached out the most. “Many had returned to their hometown from college or work and struggled to deal with the loss of their independence and private space. Some didn’t have a conducive environment at home. Family conflicts and adjustment issues cropped up,” she says. She saw problems emerge in stages. “Initially, it was anxiety about studies and jobs. Later, many wondered if the situation would ever change. Distance from their partners and friends was also a major stressor,” she says. “Some were wary of telling parents that they were taking therapy and spoke at night.” The idea of empowering people inspired Samira to become a therapist. “Therapy is commonly misunderstood as ‘fixing problems’. The real aim is to enable the individual to make decisions and provide them with tools to manage difficult situations,” she says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/how-these-women-built-communities-to-aid-mental-health-well-being/articleshow/82135907.cms||Harsh Vora

Preparations for smooth conduct of the exam were on in full swing at some exam centres even over the weekend. Amidst demands from some quarters to defer the exam in view of the rising Covid-19 cases, more than 19,200 students are set to take the exam. School heads, where the institutions are acting as exam centres and sub-centres, said that Goa Board officials are conducting awareness sessions with them in the run-up to the examination on the SOPs to be implemented. Non-teaching staffers of the school, teachers from primary section and even parents are being roped in to act as volunteers during the examination. “We have appointed 15 volunteers for every 350 students who will answer the exams. The volunteers are other than the teachers deployed for examination work by the board. While bigger institutions have engaged their non-teaching staff and primary school teachers as volunteers, institutions with fewer employees have taken help from their parent teacher association,” said one school head from Bardez taluka. Volunteers will help ensure social distancing between two students as they enter and exit the exam hall, help students locate their seating and will also carry out thermal scanning and ensure that students are wearing masks and sanitising their hands before entering . “Over the weekend, meetings were held with staff of exam centres in Sakhali and Bicholim taluka by Goa Board officials over the SOPs to be followed. Thermal scanners, sanitisers, etc, are being provided by the board . Face shields and gloves will also be provided to teachers who will be directly interacting with the students,” said a head of a school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/volunteers-to-ensure-social-distancing-at-exam-centres/articleshow/82134599.cms||---

From August 11, 2020, to January 3, the hospital had been functioning as a full-fledged Covid hospital, which had affected citizens of Ponda in need of emergency aid. They had to travel either to the Dharbandora primary health centre at Piliyem, which is 15km away from Ponda, or travel 30km to Goa Medical College (GMC) to get an X-ray. The hospital’s medical superintendent, Dr Vikas Kuwelkar, said that the health minister has informed him over the telephone that the first floor of the hospital with 63 beds will be converted into a Covid facility for symptomatic patients. Physiotherapist-turned-politician Ketan Bhatikar said the government will put the life of other patients at risk by admitting all in the same premises. He said the government should not play with the lives of people. “As done with the Hospicio Hospital, Margao, the government will soon convert the entire hospital into a Covid facility,” the Ponda MGP functionary said. Earlier, casualty services and some OPDs were made available at Dilasa, a palliative care centre run by the Indian Medical Association Charitable Trust Ponda, at Farmagudi, located about 3km away from the sub-district hospital. Bhatikar said the government has not even paid Dilasa the amount agreed to for using their facilities. Chairman of the Indian Medical Association Charitable Trust, Dr Santosh Usgaonkar, said, that they will offer the same facilities to the government this time, too. “On humanitarian grounds we have to make the facilities available for the government. They will pay the amount as per their procedure,” Usgaonkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/1st-floor-of-ponda-hosp-to-be-covid-facility-locals-upset/articleshow/82134681.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker
---||Goa||Goa: Covid 2nd wave, civic polls delay Congress party overhaul||PANAJI: The second wave has put the brakes on Congress’s efforts to overhaul and revitalise the party. The municipal elections have also forced the party to put its membership drive and its block reconstitution process on the back burner. Veteran Congressman and chairman of the Congress coordination committee for Goa Ramakant Khalap said that he is not too happy with the pace. He said that the party, which expects early elections around October, hopes to get into high gear after the second phase of the municipal elections. “What has happened is that we are going ahead with the membership drive at the block-level but in between the coronavirus flared up again. Secondly, some of our important coordinators in all the major towns are themselves candidates in the civic polls. That has affected us a bit,” Khalap said. He said that the observers appointed by AICC to oversee the overhaul process are expected to arrive in Goa after April 26. The reports prepared by the North Goa and South Goa coordination committees will presented and reviewed. Once accepted, the process to reconstitute the blocks will begin. Khalap said that the membership drive has yielded good response in certain constituencies such as Margao, Cuncolim and Panaji. “In many parts of the state there is no internet connectivity which is putting the membership drive in jeopardy. In towns like Mandrem and Pernem there are places where you don’t get internet connectivity and this is a major stumbling block,” Khalap said. On January 22, interim Congress president Sonia Gandhi constituted a 16-member state coordination committee to overhaul the party’s Goa unit, which has been in disarray since the 2017 assembly election fiasco. The 16-member committee, headed by Khalap and co-chairman Curtorim MLA Alexio Reginaldo Lourenco, were expected to reconstitute the booth, block, district and pradesh committees within three months. The possibility of early elections being held in Goa has been discussed and the party is aware that it needs to get its act together quickly, he said.

As many as 82 hospitals are offering Covid-19 care treatment in the city of which 14 are government-run hospitals. RKDF, People’s Medical College and LN Medical College have been contracted by the government to provide free of cost treatment to Covid-19 patients. Administration Academy in Bhopal has also been converted into a Covid-19 care centre. “We have capacity of home isolation for 350 people. Government has provided 30 oxygen concentrators for patients. Patients who can sustain at room temperature are being provided medical care in the facility,” said National health group, director, Dr Rajesh Sharma told TOI. Health department webpage sarthak.nhmmp.gov.in/covid/facility-bed-occupancy/ provides a list of dedicated Covid-19 treatment facilities for Madhya Pradesh. A facility-wise excel sheet is available for the same with treatment rates mentioned. However, contact information and mobile numbers have been removed from the database. There are more than 8,000 beds for coronavirus patients. Corona positive patients are getting the most problems getting admitted in tertiary care hospitals. Not a single ICU bed is empty there, said sources. The public can call the number 0755-2704225 and 0755-2704201 and get the information about the bed availability.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-more-hospitals-roped-in-to-fight-covid-but-bed-shortage-lingers/articleshow/82136318.cms||Jamal Ayub

The railway ministry said green corridors were being created to facilitate fast movement of these trains. It said the technical feasibility of transportation of LMO tankers was explored at the request of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra governments. On Friday, the railway board had approved the request of Maharashtra government to allow transportation of LMO road tankers through Roll On-Roll Off (RORO) service and had directed all its zonal general managers to make necessary preparations. “Due to restrictions of height of road overbridges (ROBs) and overhead equipment (OHE) at certain locations, out of the various specifications of road tankers, the model of road tanker T-1618 with height of 3,320mm was found feasible to be placed on flat wagons,” the board said. Inox Air Products, a manufacturer of industrial and medical gases, which joined the Indian Railways’ Oxygen Express trial, said the transportation innovation would help state governments avail oxygen in remote areas from surplus areas in a shorter time. The road transport ministry has extended the exemption of all inter-state movement of oxygen tankers from registration of permits to enable easier movement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/railways-to-put-oxygen-express-on-fast-track-with-green-corridors/articleshow/82136321.cms||---
---||Nagpur||After 2 days, Remdesivir stock arrives in Nagpur; still not enough, say officials||Nagpur: The anxiety over the acute shortage of anti-viral Remdesivir drug is set to reduce to some extent as a consignment reached here on Monday morning. There is also a possibility of another lot reaching later during the day. The district officials, however, have made it very clear that the new stock will not be enough to meet the rising demand but will give some relief. In a new directive, the Maharashtra Food and Drugs administration (FDA) authorities have now decided to allot Remdesivir to districts as per the number of positive patients. FDA would follow a policy of WHO guidelines which states that only 10% of the positive patients would require Remdesivir. There was partial sigh of relief among the government officials as the most crucial anti-viral drug of Remdesivir had reached the city after a gap of two days. The district collector’s office, which could not issue the allotment order for April 17 and 18, is learnt to have got busy in distributing the medicine to Covid hospitals as per the need.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-2-days-remdesivir-stock-arrives-in-nagpur-still-not-enough-say-officials/articleshow/82140666.cms||---
---||Goa||Another masterplan on cards for Panaji||Panaji: Yet another attempt is being made to prepare a masterplan for the capital, this time by Imagine Panaji Smart City Development Pvt Ltd. Under the Atal mission for rejuvenation and urban transformation (AMRUT), IPSCDL plans to prepare a GIS-based masterplan for Panaji using high-resolution satellite imagery provided by the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), Hyderabad. Similar attempts to create a masterplan have been undertaken in 2013 and 2017. According to sources, unlike the earlier ones, which had a 1:10,000 scale, the GIS-based master plan will be mapped at a 1:4,000 scale. The plan will geo-tag buildings and all structures in the capital including bridges, infrastructure and open spaces. While the Centre is keen on preparing the GIS-based masterplans for 500 cities in the country, Panaji is one of the 25 cities chosen by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) as part of the first round. The state government has already formed a consultancy evaluation and review committee (CERC), which met on Tuesday to review the progress made to select a consultant to prepare the masterplan. According to data available, MoHUA has released the first instalment of Rs 23.7 lakh to IPSCDL under the sub-scheme on formulation of the local area plan (LAP) and town planning scheme (TPS) under AMRUT.“Right now we are just preparing the base plan. At a later stage, we can look at reforms,” said an IPSCDL official. Formulation of masterplans start with base map preparation, existing land use surveys and collection of socio-economic data necessary for reviewing the existing situation and proposing the future land use plan. Interestingly, the state high-powered steering committee (SHPSC) has approved the reparation of the masterplan using GIS in the state annual action plan (SAAP) in January 2016. In 2017, IPSCDL announced that it had begun preparing a GIS-based masterplan by integrating geo-spatial data with a door-to-door survey. The aim, said then IPSCDL managing director Swayandipta Pal Chaudhuri, was to improve tax collection and prevent revenue leakages. The Corporation of Panaji City (CCP) had prepared a city development plan (CDP) in 2007 and in 2013, CRISIL risk infrastructure revised the CDP with the funding obtained through the JNNURM scheme. Around the same time, former chief minister and then Panaji MLA Manohar Parrrikar had tasked LKS India Pvt Ltd to prepare a holistic masterplan for Panaji.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/another-masterplan-on-cards-for-panaji/articleshow/82134864.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Nagpur||‘We must be two steps ahead ofvirus, but we end up chasing it’||Dr Shishir Shrivastav, an alumnus of IGGMCH, was among the few critical care specialists of the 1990s in the city. After the pandemic started, Dr Shrivastav has treated over 1,000 Covid patients since the August-September first wave peak at his DCH. In this interview with TOI, he shares insights on Covid management, various crises and challenges. Excerpts... What is your opinion on the second wave of Covid? This time it’s more infectious and more deadly as it is a mutant strain. Because it adapts or modifies itself to stay in a habitat so that it can survive longer and replicate more. People have become relaxed about Covid-appropriate behavior and behave as if corona is no more in existence. What are the burning issues while treating Covid patients? Lack of essential drugs like Remdesivir, Itolizumeb, Tocilizumeb and oxygen. Shortage of skilled healthcare personnel are the most acute issues. The number of beds and ventilators are inadequate to meet the demands of the large number of patients requiring them. Also, hundreds of distressed calls, exhausted and overworked staff and the discomfort of wearing PPEs in the hot climate increase stress levels. Then there is the fear of mass casualty due to lack of oxygen. All this is taking a toll on the mental health of the hospital staff. Adding to the woes is the big worry of family members of healthcare workers getting infected. Why is there so much of chaos and panic regarding the shortage of Remdesivir? I receive continuous phone calls regarding admission of Covid patients and I also get numerous calls enquiring about the availability of Remdesevir. I’m also getting patients who have taken 2 or 3 injections of Remdesivir at an exorbitant cost in desperation because they feel that this is the only drug which can save their life. I would like to state that no doubt Remdesevir is very useful as it reduces the viral load and also reduces the hospital stay but it is not a panacea for Covid. There are many factors at play. Studies conducted so far do not indicate that it has any mortality benefits. Therefore I appeal to people at large to not panic and buy Remdesivir indiscriminately and hoard it. There are other drugs too which are given to Covid patients and that Ramdesivir is the only drug is a myth. What should be the approach in dealing with such Covid waves? We should be two steps ahead of the virus by following strict norms of social distancing and hand hygiene practices. The government machinery as well as the healthcare industry should also be alert and in a state of preparedness for the abrupt rise of cases by increasing the infrastructure and manpower. Unfortunately, we believe in chasing the virus after the wave is on us with a vengeance due to which there is chaos all-round. As a doctor and hospital administrator, what kind of problems are you facing? Patients are of the younger generation. With more fulminant virus strain, they are deteriorating fast. There are many patients who require a high flow of oxygen and ventilators. Managing all hospitalised patients and making beds available for the ones who are in great distress is a herculean task where you have to triage the patients on merit basis. Relatives of patients need virtual counselling and sometimes, a one-to-one session. The cost of treatment goes up when a patient needs high-end modalities and medicines but unfortunately many of the needy patients can’t afford it. How has Covid affected the people of Nagpur? Covid has affected the social, physical, mental and economic health of our society. Many with non-Covid illnesses are unable to get treatment. The elderly and children are unable to enjoy social freedom and it affects them adversely. Many have died untimely leaving behind devastated family and friends. It seems like a battle with no end in sight if timely intervention with a proper strategy of rapid vaccination and strict distancing and hand washing are not implemented. What kind of suggestions would you like to give people? Physical distancing, don’t be a part of gatherings, avoid unnecessary outings, spend more time with your family, don’t obsess over Covid news, don’t create panic in your circle. Fight Covid by following strict protocols. Is there any way by which the demand for beds can be reduced? One way to utilize the bed optimally is to give early discharge as soon as the patient shows signs of improvement and needs only about 2 to 3 litres of oxygen. This may be achieved by using home oxygen concentrators or oxygen cylinders. Unfortunately, both are in short supply and thus we cannot discharge patients who could otherwise easily be managed at home and free up the bed capacity for more critical patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/we-must-be-two-steps-ahead-ofvirus-but-we-end-up-chasing-it/articleshow/82133794.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Goa||Pipeline work delayed, parts of Bardez still without water||Panaji: Residents of many parts of Bardez taluka complained of having gone without piped water supply for three to four days in a row until Sunday. Many residents took to social media to express their anger as Bardez was also facing a power shutdown for the first half of Sunday for annual maintenance works, further worsening their woes. The public works department (PWD) had announced that the entire Bardez taluka will have no water supply on April 15 and 16 and will receive restricted supply on April 17 and 21. This was because the work of shifting of the 1,000mm main pipeline from Colvale to Karaswada was due to be taken up from April 15. Official sources said the work of shifting the pipeline was taken up after frequent damage to the existing line was being experienced during the ongoing highway expansion work on the Colvale-Karaswada stretch. However, sources said, the work could not be completed by April 16 as scheduled. “Many leakages were found in the pipeline and the time taken to install the new pipeline was extended as the leakages had to be plugged first,” officials said. They managed to plug the leakages in the new pipeline by Sunday evening. “But once the water supply network is shut down, there is a delay of eight hours for the entire supply chain to function at its normal capacity. On Sunday, water supply resumed to parts of the taluka like Aldona,” an official said. But parts of Porvorim, Sangolda, Saligao, Candolim, and some areas of Siolim did not receive supply. These areas can expect to receive restricted water supply starting from Monday evening, officials said. Sources said many parts of Bardez can expect water supply to normalise only from April 22 onwards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pipeline-work-delayed-parts-of-bardez-still-without-water/articleshow/82134882.cms||---

Meena issued the direction during a meeting with crime branch superintendent of police (SP) Shobhit Saxena and those police inspectors who are investigating the cases related to illegal mining. Sources said that the DGP told investigating officers to complete the investigation as soon as possible and decide whether to file chargesheets or closure reports. Sources also said that the directions have been issued after the opposition vociferously highlighted the issue in the recently concluded legislative assembly session, while stating that there is not much progress in the illegal mining cases. SIT has filed 16 first information reports (FIRs) in the illegal mining cases, of which eight cases have been chargesheeted, three cases have been closed and three have been transferred to police stations. Sources said that three cases have been quashed by the court. Presently, four police officers are investigating the illegal mining cases, even as the main mining case is pending investigation. The SIT has been probing these cases for the past six years, but there hasn’t been much progress. As part of its investigation into the Rs 35,000 crore scam, sources said the SIT is studying the documents submitted by the directorate of mines and geology (DMG) with regards to 126 mining leases. The SIT is also coordinating with other departments to collect more documents. The investigating team had sought answers from the DMG to 19 questions pertaining to the leases, which were operational from 2007 to 2012. The documents provided to the SIT include environmental clearances (EC) issued to the leases, quantity-related papers, and EC limits. On July 26, 2013, the mines department had filed a criminal complaint with the crime branch, seeking that it fixes criminal liability against those involved. It had also requested the police to file an FIR against persons identified in the reports of the Supreme Court-appointed Central Empowered Committee, the Shah Commission and the Public Accounts Committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dgp-tells-sit-to-speed-up-probe-in-illegal-mining-cases/articleshow/82134901.cms||Murari Shetye
---||India||24-hour EC ban on Bengal BJP neta, TMC candidate||KOLKATA: The Election Commission on Sunday imposed a 24-hour campaign ban on BJP’s Sayantan Basu and Trinamool Congress candidate from Arambag Sujata Mondal for their remarks in violation of the model code of conduct. The 24-hour ban kicked in at 7pm on Sunday. With public meetings and rallies barred between 7pm and 10am on account of Covid-19, the ban will effectively restrain them from active campaigning for nine hours only. Basu, in a speech at North 24 Parganas on April 12, had linked the April 10 firing by central forces in Sitalkuchi to the death of 18-year-old Ananda Barman, brother of BJP’s ‘shakti kendra pramukh’, and threatened that four people would be killed for each political murder. In his response to the EC notice, Basu said his remarks were being misinterpreted and that they were not made with the intent to threaten voters but to show those violating the law would be dealt with sternly. He also denied making communal remarks. At the same time, he added that if any of his statements was construed as a violation of the model code, he regretted it. Mondal, on the other hand, had said in an interview to a Bengali news channel, “The Scheduled Castes here are beggars by nature, and in spite of Mamata Banerjee helping them, they have been sold to BJP at a petty amount and are now torturing us. Today, my vehicle’s glass was damaged and they were after me with lathis, guns, bombs etc to kill me.” In her reply to the EC notice, Mondal said her statement was forcibly recorded by the media after she was attacked and that she was only expressing her grief at the lifethreatening attempt on her “at the behest of paid BJP goons”. She said she didn’t intend to promote enmity or illwill and that the statements were made in good faith.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/24-hour-ec-ban-on-bengal-bjp-neta-tmc-candidate/articleshow/82136352.cms||---

Few parts of Goa received light rain and the mercury rose slightly, causing discomfort during the night. India meteorological department (IMD), Panaji had forecast light rain or thunder showers on April 18 and 19 — and not April 19 and 20, as reported by TOI — due to the presence of the trough and westerly winds bringing in moisture from Arabian Sea. The trough may continue to persist and it will determine the intensity of rain, whether a drizzle or thunder showers, while its influence affects the weather. On Sunday, as IMD, Panaji, had forecast, the minimum temperature rose by a degree above normal to 26.6 degrees Celsius. “It will rise on Monday as well. Then, it may gradually come back to normal values,” M Rahul, scientist, IMD, Panaji said. The maximum temperature also rose by just over a degree, as IMD recorded 34.4 degrees C on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mercury-rise-to-persist-today-too/articleshow/82134912.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Doctor among four held for Remdesivir black marketing||BHOPAL: Crime branch police on Saturday arrested four youth, including a doctor allegedly for black marketing of Remdesivir — an antiviral injection administered to corona patients. The injection is out of stock across the country and the state. The recent incident of black marketing of Remdesvir injection comes a day after 860 vials were stolen from the drug store of the state-run Hamidia Hospital in Bhopal. Police however, denied link of the racket busted with the theft in Hamidia Hospital. Four injections were recovered from the gang so far and it was suspected that it was just a tip of the iceberg, as all the accused are linked to the medical field and they were arranging injections from doctors or medical store workers. The accused used to sell per unit of injection for Rs 18,000 to 20,000. Crime Branch SHO Yogita Sadankar said, on Saturday afternoon police received a tip-off that a man was black marketing Remdesivir injection near Shahjehnabad Islami Gate. A team of crime branch rushed to the spot and arrested the accused one by one. Sadankar said that when police asked them to produce supporting documents or prescriptions justifying Remdesivir with them they were unable to do so. They all are linked with medical field and they had created a chain of fraudsters, who would provide the doses after taking their cut and profit. The cost of injection would increase and it would move through a chain and one would forward to another after adding his profit. The SHO said it was just a tip of iceberg as people related to medical field including a doctor were black marketing for profit in the time of pandemic. “The four accused were identified as Dr Ehsan Khan, 22, who works as a doctor at a private hospital, Shahjahanabad and a resident of Karond. Shami Khan, 30, a resident of Arif Nagar in Shahjahanabad, Akhlaq Khan, 24, a resident of DIG Bungalow and Nomaan Khan, 30, a resident of Kabitpura” said SHO Sadankar adding that two of them work at medical shops. Three of the four arrested accused revealed that Nomaan provided Remdesivir injections. Nomaan told he got the injection from a person who is on the run. The SHO said that investigations are underway to link the entire chain involved in black marketing of injections.

With the latest Covid surge coinciding with the holy month of Ramzan, more people are trying to clear their doubts about the virus and its vaccine by interacting with clerics. Maulana Ishak Gora, who runs a free online service in Deoband, said, “A large number of people are coming forward with queries related to the pandemic. So, a panel of clerics was formed”. Meanwhile, vice-chancellor of Darul Uloom Deoband, Maulana Abul Qasim Nomani, urged Muslims to strictly follow the government’s guidelines. In a written statement, he said, “To break the chain, the state administration has imposed night curfew. It should be followed at all cost”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/follow-covid-norms-hiding-disease-a-sin-deoband-clerics/articleshow/82136357.cms||Mohd Dilshad

After America, India is the only other country that has crossed this level of cumulative cases. On Sunday, Maharashtra saw its highest single-day addition of positive cases ever at 68,631, pushing the state’s overall total to 38,39,338. Over 500 coronavirus deaths were reported on Sunday, the highest seen on a single day after seven months and for the first time in the second wave. For the fourth consecutive day, India added more than 2 lakh daily cases to its overall tally. This week alone saw the net addition of 15 lakh which is 10% of India’s total Covid-19 tally. The rise in cases has been exponential in the past one week as the 15 lakh cases added between April-11 and April-18 is more than 14.5 lakh cases added in the last two months (February and March) put together. For the sixth consecutive day, the country is reporting over a thousand daily deaths. In the past seven days, India has seen over 8,000 cumulative deaths. Since the beginning of the outbreak, 1.8 lakh people have died because of Covidinduced complications. State-wise comparison of cases shows that Maharashtra has remained the worst affected state with more than 68,000 cases reported on a single day. UP and Delhi are the second and third-worst affected state/UT in terms of daily cases and these two together accounted for about 56,000 cases — nearly similar to the extent of cases reported in Maharashtra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-adds-2-7-lakh-covid-cases-goes-past-1-5-crore-mark/articleshow/82136369.cms||---

Disqualifying them will give Goa justice as this will hold the MLAs accountable for betraying the 2017 election mandate. “Disqualifying the 12 defectors will send out a clear message to every other politician that it is paramount to respect the mandate of the people and put the people’s wishes ahead of their own personal agenda,” said Goencho Avaaz’s executive committee. “How could they believe that it would be okay to change parties after being voted to power on the ticket of another party?” Goencho Avaaz also said that reports of a new, full-fledged governor for Goa has given rise to speculation about new developments afoot, including the possible imposition of President’s rule in Goa. It said there are apprehensions that if the MLAs are disqualified, President’s rule could be imposed in Goa so that the Centre could continue to push certain projects in Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/disqualify-12-mlas-who-switched-parties/articleshow/82134995.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: BJP refutes Congress charges against CM||BICHOLIM: BJP councillors, sarpanchas and panchas from civic bodies of Sakhali refuted allegations made by Congress functionaries against chief minister Pramod Sawant of interference and revenge politics in the affairs of the Sakhali Municipal Council. Three days ago, Congress-backed councillors managed to pass a no-trust motion against Sawant-backed chairperson Yeshwant Madkar. It was preceded by a notice of disqualification issued to a councillor. The no-confidence motion could be passed only after the high court of Bombay at Goa stayed the proceedings of disqualification before urban development minister Milind Naik. At a press conference held at the BJP office in Sakhali on Sunday, Madkar said, “Sawant is a leader who has come from the poor strata of the society and never resorted to the politics of revenge. His focus is to help the people.” He also denied charges made by former Sakhali chairperson Dharmesh Saglani that the key of the chairperson office was not handed over to them. He said the key has been kept in the office itself. Meanwhile, a BJP functionary from Sakhali, Shrirang Sawal, said Congress leaders are hell bent upon defaming Sawant as they cannot come to terms with the quantum of good work being done by him. “However, the people of Sakhali constituency are with the chief minister,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-refutes-cong-charges-against-cm/articleshow/82135080.cms||---

CCP commissioner Sanjit Rodrigues issued a show-cause notice to the hair salon and academy which has been operating along the Rua de Ourem road without any valid licence. Rodrigues warned the hair salon that if it failed to comply, “action as deemed fit” shall be taken. A local resident, RTI activist Rakesh Kambli, obtained information from CCP and has urged the corporation to recover unpaid taxes from the hair salon and academy. “It has been observed by the official of CCP that you are running the business activity of hair beauty salon and academy without valid licences,” Rodrigues stated in the show-cause notice. It said that failure to comply or respond to the show-cause notice would lead the civic body to close or stop the business activity. “Many of these businessmen come here and operate illegally by flouting local laws,” Kambli said. “CCP should recover all dues and ensure that they start operations only after getting licences. My main aim is that such illegal businesses which are operating in the state, and where the state is losing revenue, should be stopped.” Interestingly, RTI documents show that CCP had refused to grant a trade and occupation licence to the hair salon in June 2019 as it had failed to furnish an occupancy certificate for the premises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ccp-issues-show-cause-notice-to-salon-for-operating-without-licence/articleshow/82135196.cms||---

He later deleted the tweet and clarified that it was for someone else. “@dm_ghaziabad Please check this out. Please help us, my brother needs a bed for corona treatment. Now beds are not available in Ghaziabad. @shalabhmani @PankajSinghBJP @Gen_VKSingh,” the retired Army general wrote in a tweet which was partly written in Hindi, while tagging the DM of Ghaziabad. Singh is also the BJP MP from Ghaziabad. The tweet, which was posted around 12.30pm, was shared by over a 1,000 people within two hours. Politicians such as Sena’s Priyanka Chaturvedi and Congress’ YB Srivatsa also quoted the tweet to highlight the strained healthcare facilities in India. Singh responded to these tweets and wrote around 2.30pm, “Clarification: I tweeted this request so that the district administration can reach the person in need and provide him with the medical care that his brother requires. He is not my brother by blood relation, but by bond of humanity. I think it’s an alien concept to some.” Singh later deleted his clarification as well, and attacked alleged trolls. “Am amazed at IQ level of trawls (sic) and fastest finger channels. Tweet was forward of a tweet to DM and says ‘please look into this’. Forwarded tweet is in Hindi. Bed needs have been sorted out by DM & CMO, hence to DM.

---||Kolkata||EC imposes 24-hour campaign ban on BJP leader, Trinamool candidate||Kolkata: BJP’s Bengal secretary Sayantan Basu and Trinamool Congress’s Arambag candidate and star campaigner Sujata Mondal were barred from campaigning for 24 hours starting from 7pm on Sunday by the Election Commission over their controversial remarks during the ongoing polls. The ban came after the EC sent notices to both leaders, on April 15 and April 16 respectively, seeking their replies. In an order dated April 18, the panel said it had carefully considered Mondal’s reply, which didn’t justify the relevant portions of her statement “denigrating the Scheduled Caste community in West Bengal”, and remarked that it violated the model code of conduct. The BJP had moved the EC against Mondal alleging she had told the media that “Scheduled Caste people in Bengal were like beggars by nature and inspite of whatever chief minister Mamata Banerjee did for them, they were allegedly sold to BJP at a petty amount and were now torturing the ruling party”. Mondal claimed that the statements were “forcibly recorded by the press”. “The commission sternly warns Sujata Mondal and advises her to desist from using such statements while making public utterances during the period when model code of conduct is in force,” it said. Basu was issued a notice for his remark “if you kill one, we will kill four of you” that he had made at a poll rally in Baranagar on April 11. In his reply Basu claimed the statement was misinterpreted and that it was made not with the intent to threaten Bengal and its people but to show that violation of law will be dealt with sternly by law-enforcement agencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ec-imposes-24-hour-campaign-ban-on-bjp-leader-trinamool-candidate/articleshow/82135246.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Common man won’t be ‘second-grade’ citizen in Bengal after May 2, says Shah||Purbasthali Uttar/Swarupnagar: Union home minister Amit Shah promised that a BJP government would help the common man in Bengal — treated as “second grade” citizens due to “vote-bank politics” under the Trinamool Congress regime — lead a normal life after May 2. “In Didi’s (Mamata Banerjee) regime, people have to move court for Durga idol immersion. Students in schools can’t perform Saraswati Puja because Didi thinks that might go against her vote-bank politics. We are treated like second-grade citizens,” Shah said on Sunday as Bengal polls entered the sixth phase covering 43 constituencies, most of which are Indo-Bangla border seats spread across North 24 Parganas, Nadia and Uttar Dinajpur. The Union minister raised the polarization pitch in Purbasthali Uttar in East Burdwan, listing three categories of people in Bengal unlike the rest of the country. “The first kind is infiltrators. The second kind is common people, who are treated like second-grade citizens. And third are refugees such as Matuas and Namasudras, who haven’t got citizenship for nearly 70 years and are unable to lead a decent life. Come May 2, the BJP government will do away with these categories,” he said. Shah added that BJP and not others — Trinamool, Congress, Communists — could stop infiltration, and iterated his party’s commitment to grant citizenship to refugees, particularly Matuas and Namasudras. The Union minister also assured a shift from “Didi’s bomb-banduk-barud model” to the Modi model of “vishwas-vyapar-vikas”. “We want to change this and bring governance of development, trust and industry. The politics of violence will not continue in Bengal,” he said. In an attempt to split the Dalit-Namasudra-Muslim support for the Bengal chief minister in the 2011 and 2016 assembly polls, Shah pointed to the derogatory comment Trinamool’s Sujata Mandal had made against scheduled castes. He said: “How could a Trinamool leader insult a community, calling them beggars? Why is Didi silent?” Shah also referred to the leaked audio tape recording a purported conversation between the CM and a Trinamool leader, to say how a person of her stature could stoop to such a low. “Didi is asking to keep bodies of the dead in the unfortunate incident and hold rally the next day with the dead,” he said. The BJP senior said Banerjee was “perturbed” after fifth-phase polling and was abusing the PM, HM (home minister) and security forces. “She keeps on saying that we are outsiders. I have come here to help you vote out Didi. I am not going to stay back and rule Bengal.” Shah said. The Union minister claimed his party had bagged 122 seats after five phases and was on its way to victory. “Nandigram has bid farewell to Didi. Now, entire Bengal will do that,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/common-man-wont-be-second-grade-citizen-in-bengal-after-may-2-says-shah/articleshow/82135252.cms||Mohammad Asif
---||Kolkata||BJP’s Malda (SC) candidate hit in throat by bullet; party worker dies in Nadia||Malda/Nadia/Burdwan: BJP’s Malda (SC) candidate Gopal Chandra Saha was hit by a stray bullet in his throat when he was busy campaigning at Sahapur Bazar in Old Malda city on Sunday evening. Saha was rushed to Malda Medical College and Hospital, where doctors were trying to locate the bullet. Hospital sources said Saha was stable and his vital parameters were fine. He will undergo an operation. It was not clear where the bullet was fired from around 8.45pm. BJP accused “Trinamool goons” of opening fire at the busy marketplace. Trinamool Congress denied any role and sought a thorough probe. Saha’s nomination had triggered a major internal feud in BJP. Party supporters had blocked roads, protesting against his candidature from Malda (SC) constituency. Sunday was marred by other violence too, reported from pockets where polling got over the day before. Within 12 hours of polling at Chakdaha assembly constituency in Nadia, active BJP worker Dilip Kirtania, who was threatened with “dire consequences” on poll day, was found lying unconscious, injuries all over his body, in the bush behind his Routari locality home by his mother. “Dilip was rushed to Chakdaha State General Hospital, where he was declared brought dead,” said Chakdaha’s BJP candidate Bankim Ghosh. According to Ghosh, Dilip’s mother said he had stepped out to the toilet just outside their home past midnight. She found the rear door ajar at 6am and saw Dilip lying in the bush. Dilip, 30, was allegedly threatened by Trinamool goons on Saturday. He had been beaten up during the last Lok Sabha polls, and was reportedly asked to quit BJP. Demanding arrest of the culprits within 24 hours, BJP workers besieged Chakdaha police station and blocked NH-34. BJP leaders Soumitra Khan and Kailash Vijayvargiya were scheduled to reach the spot. Trinamool denied any role in Dilip’s death. The party’s Chakdaha candidate, Jishu Singh, said: “A proper investigation will reveal the truth. Trinamool is in no way involved in the murder.” Singh instead alleged that BJP goons had unleashed terror by attacking TMC supporters’ houses since last evening. Also on Sunday, a clash broke out between Trinamool and BJP supporters at Lakshmipur ground in South Burdwan. Both camps claimed that their supporters were beaten up with flag poles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjps-malda-sc-candidate-hit-in-throat-by-bullet-party-worker-dies-in-nadia/articleshow/82135310.cms||Ashis Poddar
---||Kolkata||Mamata cancels all her ‘big rallies’ in Kolkata over Covid fears||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday cancelled all her “big rallies and meetings” in Kolkata in view of the huge spike in Covid cases and urged her party leaders to scale down their campaigns in the city in the run-up to the two phases of polls (April 26 and 29) that involve seats in Kolkata proper. Speaking to a private TV channel, the Trinamool Congress chief said she would hold only one meeting — at Beadon Street in north Kolkata on April 26. She also said that she would hold fewer public rallies in the districts in less time, where “cases are lower”. Earlier in the day, Banerjee wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, flagging doctors’ concerns on “extremely scarce and uncertain” supplies of two key Covid medicines — Remdesivir and Tocilizumab — to Bengal, and urging him to look into the “scarce and erratic” flow of vaccines to the state and ensure steady oxygen supply. In the interview, Banerjee said the state administration was trying to ramp up its Covid beds by 20% and said asymptomatic patients should remain in home isolation, unless advised otherwise by doctors. She said the state was trying to increase its safe-home facilities for mildly symptomatic patients and advising people to be “very cautious and not to panic.” Stressing she had urged the Election Commission for clubbing the last three poll phases, she took a dig at BJP: “To fight me, they are making Bengal suffer.” Banerjee, who held a roadshow on Sunday, said: “At least the last two phases could be held in one.” In her message to the PM, Banerjee identified three areas that required the PM’s intervention to “to scale up our capabilities to tackle the pandemic on a war footing.” She stressed on vaccination first, saying it was of “top importance.” Arguing that “focused and aggressive vaccination is extremely important,” particularly in Kolkata due to its “high population density”, she said “unfortunately”, the supply of vaccines from the Centre has been scarce and erratic, which is “negatively affecting our vaccination programme.” The CM said Bengal, which was among the “best performers” in the vaccination programme, was “now suffering” due to vaccine supply uncertainty from the Centre. She said the state needed 5.4 crore doses to vaccinate 2.7 crore people and urged the PM to intervene “to ensure that the state gets its requirement of vaccine doses fulfilled at the earliest.” Over 87 lakh people have been vaccinated in Bengal, and over 75 lakh of them have got their first dose. Banerjee’s second concern was the fast-depleting stocks of Covid medicines. Banerjee told the PM that this issue has been a “matter of grave concern” for doctors here. “We need around 6,000 vials of Remdesivir and 1,000 vials of Tocilizumab daily. However, at present only 1,000 vials of Remdesivir are available daily and no fresh supply of Tocilizumab is coming. It may kindly be seen that the relevant authorities step up their efforts to ensure steady supply of these most essential medicines as soon as possible,” she wrote in her two-page letter. Banerjee’s third concern was regarding oxygen. She said the supply of oxygen “must be assured and certain.” The CM said SAIL has been meeting up “our need for the moment, (and) we will be grateful if you kindly instruct them too for ensuring steady supplies.” She also stressed that Bengal was “willing to extend its resources to the fullest in tandem with the Centre to tackle the pandemic the country is facing now and overcome it.” In the same letter, the CM also reminded Modi of a letter she had sent on February 24, seeking permission to buy vaccines from state funds to launch a free mass vaccination drive in Bengal. “However, the state has not received the requisite clearance yet. In the meantime, the number of cases in the state has also begun to increase sharply, particularly in view of the coming of a large numbers of outsiders to the state for election campaign and other purposes at the behest of some political parties,” she wrote, echoing what she has been regularly saying in her public meetings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mamata-cancels-all-her-big-rallies-in-kol-over-cov-fears/articleshow/82135400.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Scramble for beds in Kolkata as Covid bomb hits home||Senior physician Sukumar Mukherjee, who is at the forefront of strategising the state’s Covid response as part of the expert committee, faced immense problems getting beds for three patients, one of them a former judge, and the other a relative.  Another senior health department official who is coordinating Covid management had a trying time finding a bed for a relative.  A 45-year-old south Kolkata resident, who collapsed at home on Friday night, was taken to five hospitals along the Bypass, but none could admit him for want of a bed. The family managed to persuade a small nursing home to take him in. An acute shortage of Covid beds threatens to overwhelm Kolkata in the middle of a swirling second wave. On a day the daily case-rise in the city crossed the 2,000 mark — the highest since the pandemic began — several city hospitals reported that they were running to capacity, even as others said they were almost full. “Almost 86% of the total bed strength has now been pressed into Covid care service,” said Pradip Tondon, CEO, Belle Vue Clinic, adding, “All 167 beds, including 37 meant for critical care, are occupied. If any new positive patient comes in before a vacancy arises, we have to request the family to take the patient to another facility as we cannot admit the patient in the non-Covid ward.” Mukherjee, whose example has been cited above, said: “I had a tough time getting patients admitted. Over the past 24 hours, I tried to get beds for three patients — a former chief justice of Bombay High Court, an actor and relative of mine. Hospitals are out of beds. I had to plead with authorities of a private hospital to get two of them admitted. I found space for the third at the ID Hospital.” There are 5,157 Covid beds in the city. Officially, Kolkata had 13,773 active cases on Sunday, with 2,197 new cases reported over the last 24 hours. Across Bengal, too, the new case count (8,419) was the highest ever, taking the total active case count to 49,638. With Kolkata the epicentre of Bengal’s second wave, most hospitals have set up help desks, where they are noting down contact details of patients, with a brief note on the patient’s condition, so that they can prioritise and call back when beds are available. Luckily, most people are calling up beforehand to find out about vacancies. “Had they landed up at the hospital, the situation would have been worse. As soon as we have a vacancy, we are calling in a patient on the basis of his or her condition,” said Sudipta Mitra, Peerless Hospital CEO. On Saturday, the hospital called in a 50-year-old patient who had been admitted in a nursing home. The patient had mild hypoxia and the family wanted to get her admitted to a bigger facility. At Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, each of its 56 Covid beds are occupied. “We will scale it up to 100 beds in the next two days. In addition, we plan to take over an adjacent hotel and utilise it for the treatment of Covid patients. In such a case, we will be able to have 60 more beds in this hotel, where we will put in our doctors, nurses and other support staff,” said Rana Dasgupta, CEO (Eastern Region), Apollo Hospitals group. Simmardeep Gill, the COO of CK Birla Hospitals CMRI, said they were “constantly expanding” their Covid beds. “Currently, all our 130 beds, including 44 critical care beds, are full. We should be able to add around 25 more beds over the next two weeks,” he added. Government hospitals, too, are dogged by the massive influx of Covid patients. “From 441 beds, we have increased the capacity to 547 but they are mostly occupied. Unlike the first wave, the patient count is rising so rapidly that it is proving a challenge to keep pace and augment the infrastructure. We are scaling up the bed strength to 713 but we need a lot more,” said Sisir Naskar, superintendent, MR Bangur Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/scramble-for-beds-in-city-as-covid-bomb-hits-home/articleshow/82135345.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Silent campaign for ‘No Vote to BJP’ now spreads to 20 Bengal districts||KOLKATA: Alongside the fierce political war being fought between Trinamool Congress led by Mamata Banerjee and its main challenger BJP led by none other than Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Bengal, a silent campaign has caught on. Steadily spreading from urban to semi-urban to the rural battleground, instead of seeking votes, it is asking people “to not cast a single vote for BJP”. Running parallel to that of political parties, the platform “No Vote to BJP” was set up by a group of political and civil rights activists in January. “The alarm bells rang when BJP won 18 of the 42 seats in 2019 Lok Sabha polls… we knew we had to do something… BJP’s ideology or culture is in basic conflict with the ethos of people here… its presence can only create conflict,” said Kushal Debnath, a senior leader of the platform and former trade union activist who was jailed for five months by the Trinamool government under UAPA. Speaking to TOI on his way back from a public meeting in Krishnagar, Debnath was already preparing for the next day in Bolpur. From the January press conference in Kolkata, attended by a handful of like-minded people, to a silent march on March 10 that saw more than 1,000 people participating, the movement had caught people’s attention. Starting out as a sideshow, playing in parallel to the high-decibel Trinamool and BJP pitch, the campaign has spread to 20 districts. Three phases to go, in the middle of a raging Covid pandemic, Debnath and his associates — political and rights activists —have done over 100 street corner meetings. The gatherings have between 100 and 200 people. Sixteen printed booklets, more than 1 lakh leaflets, 20-odd video clips (over 10 lakh views for some), 4 lakh posters and banners, publicity vehicles (Matador vans) with tableaus and social media are ammunitions that have so far been used. The main talking points against BJP include 12 crore people lost their jobs during lockdown, sufferings of migrant labourers, promises on jobs , its talk of protecting women when Hathras and other such incidents happen in BJP-ruled states, tribal rights on forest land, the new agriculture laws, NRC and CAA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/silent-campaign-for-no-vote-to-bjp-now-spreads-to-20-bengal-districts/articleshow/82135239.cms||Mohua Chatterjee

---||Ranchi||Hemant seeks Centre’s nod to buy Remdesivir from Bangladesh||Ranchi: In the wake of severe crisis of Remdesivir, considered an important life-saving drug for treatment critical Covid-19 patients, in the state, chief minister Hemant Soren on Sunday shot off a letter to the Union government asking for permission to import 50,000 vials of the medicine from Bangladesh. In his letter to Union fertilizer minister D V Sadanand Gowda, Hemant said the state government has contacted pharmaceutical companies in the neighbouring country who are ready to export the medicine. “We had anticipated the second wave to be less virulent due to vaccination and herd immunity. However, a large number of patients is showing major symptoms and requires hospitalization and other treatment. Jharkhand being a land locked state and with borders with five different states coupled with special migrant trains, it is only going to make the situation worse in the coming days,” he wrote. “Unfortunately, there is acute scarcity of Remdesivir in this state since the beginning of this month. Despite our best efforts, we aren’t able to meet demands of patients which is causing adverse impact on the recovery and fatality rate in the state. The situation is such that against the total order of 76,640 vials, Jharkhand has only received 8038 vials of the drug in last fortnight, leading to the medicine not being administered to many. We contacted Beximco Pharmaceutical Limited in Bangladesh for 50,000 vials of the injection at a total cost of one million dollars which the state is ready to bear,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hemant-seeks-centres-nod-to-buy-remdesivir-from-bangladesh/articleshow/82133679.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Rahul suspends all Bengal rallies, urges other leaders to do a rethink||Kolkata: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday suspended all his political rallies in Bengal and urged others to consider the consequences of holding public meetings amid the prevailing Covid-19 situation. Bengal power minister Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, who is contesting from Bhowanipore, also said he will desist from organising “any major rally”. Rahul posted on Twitter: "In view of the Covid situation, I am suspending all my public rallies in West Bengal. I would advise all political leaders to think deeply about the consequences of holding large public rallies under the current circumstances.” A senior Congress leader said Rahul’s programme was not finalised but his rallies were meant before the seventh (April 26) and eight (April 29) phases, particularly in Murshidabad and Malda. “Now, we will have a tough time to bring in a star campaigner for major rallies in these two districts, where Congress has a traditional edge,” he said. Rahul has addressed only one public rally in Goalpokhor in North Dinajpur on April 14. Congress’s alliance partner, the Left Front, has announced it will not hold public rallies due to Covid. Chattopadhyay — Trinamool's pick to replace CM Mamata Banerjee in Bhowanipore after she chose to contest from Nandigram — also posted on Twitter: “With the rise in Covid cases, I have decided not to hold any central rally in Bhowanipore for the upcoming election campaign, which I have always held in previous elections. Requesting everyone to wear mask & stay safe.” Bhowanipore goes to polls on April 26. The developments coincided with Covid-19 taking a toll on Bengal candidates. On Sunday, when state prisons minister Ujjal Biswas — the TMC contestant from Krishnanagar South — was being tested before the routine screening to be on the same dais with the CM, he tested positive. He was immediately advised home isolation. Polls for the remaining Nadia seats are slated for April 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rahul-suspends-all-bengal-rallies-urges-other-leaders-to-do-a-rethink/articleshow/82135248.cms||---
---||Kolkata||PM Modi must resign over Covid spike across country: Mamata Banerjee||BARRACKPORE: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday said PM Narendra Modi should resign over the nationwide Covid spike. Accusing Modi of misleading the nation and not planning, Banerjee said: “All he says is he has to win Bengal.” Citing the Covid spike in Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh leading to deaths, she added, “If anything were to happen in Bengal, they would have blamed me and written all lies on social media.” Banerjee accused the PM of being busy in electioneering when he should have prepared the country to handle the pandemic’s second wave. “It is common knowledge that a pandemic of this scale does not go away before two years,” she added. Saying that she had urged Modi to allow Bengal to buy vaccines for all its people, Banerjee added: “Today there are not enough vaccines in the country, but we are sending those to eighty countries. First, provide a vaccine to your own people. We should help others, but this is like donating food to others when there is no food at home. And all this to glorify his name.” “In UP, they are raising walls around crematoriums. In other places, vaccines are being given from party offices. In Bengal, we had brought Covid under control. And now, they are even bringing in outsiders to construct their pandals. When cases were dipping in the last six months, didn’t it ever cross Modi’s mind that more people should have been vaccinated? Then the cases would not have spiralled like they are doing now,” she added. “These outsider goons who are coming to Bengal, not a single of them are being tested. And these people are spreading the disease here. The Prime Minister has made a rule that only the Centre can procure vaccines, the states can’t. We immediately need 5.4 crore vaccine doses. I said let us buy those. We haven’t got those even,” Banerjee said. The CM said: “There is no oxygen in the country, medicines are scarce. The Maharashtra government has also written. We will write a strong letter too.” Banerjee also blamed the Election Commission for curtailing her campaign time by five days while turning a blind eye to her plea to club the last three phases of polls because of the surge in cases. “I am not saying being infected with the virus is a crime. But the reckless act of the BJP has triggered the sudden rise in the number of coronavirus cases in recent times,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/didi-modi-must-resign-over-covid-spike-across-country/articleshow/82135311.cms||Suman Chakraborti

In the last two days, nearly 50,000 persons have tested positive and nearly 330 people have died of Covid. The rising cases have put an unprecedented stress on the existing health infrastructure and the availability of oxygen. CM Arvind Kejriwal will meet LG Anil Baijal Monday to discuss the impact of the weekend curfew and take a call on whether further curbs, including the extension of the weekend curfew, are needed. The weekend curfew will end at 5am on Monday. According to sources, the government may extend the weekend curfew, but there was no official confirmation on this. “In the last 24 hours, 25,500 Covid cases have come up. Before that, we had 24,000 cases, and the day before that we had 19,500 cases. The cases are increasing rapidly. Another concern is that in the last 24 hours, the positivity rate has increased to 30%... (from) around 24% the day before,” Kejriwal said. Active cases now 75k, govt adds 2k beds in 12 hospitalsA positivity rate of almost 30% means nearly one in every three persons is testing positive for coronavirus. The positivity rate jumped by 6 percentage points in only 24 hours, which means the infection i s spreading very fast. The number of active cases has jumped to 75,000; of them, 35,000 are under home isolation. Hospitals are filling up fast, leading to an acute shortage of beds. The government on Sunday added over 2,000 Covid beds across 12 Delhi government hospitals. Two hundred beds have been increased in Lok Nayak Hospital, 350 beds in Burari hospital, 400 in Ambedkar Hospital, and 300 in DDU hospital, besides some other hospitals. “If we take a look at the situation in Delhi, we have noted that the number of available beds reserved for Covid is reducing rapidly. A large number of patients are being admitted to hospitals and we are falling short of ICU beds. In Delhi, we are now left with less than 100 ICU beds. We are falling short of oxygen as well. Last night, a private hospital told us that the shortage was so severe that they just about managed to prevent a tragedy. We have been in touch with the Centre, and have asked for aid, which we are getting; and for that, we’d like to thank them,” Kejriwal said. An order has also been issued for all nursing homes and private hospitals providing Covid treatment to reserve at least 80% of their ICU bed capacity and 80% of their ward bed capacity for Covid patients. In Gurugram, ventilator beds’ demand hits new high A number of residents were seen scrambling on Sunday to get Covid-19 patients in their families admitted to hospitals, with the sudden surge in Covid cases putting a strain on Gurugram’s medical infrastructure. The ICU and ventilator beds are nearing capacityat present, and only 17 of the 491 ICU beds and eight of the 233 ventilator beds are vacant. Notably, 228 oxygen beds were still available in the millennium city on Sunday. On Sunday, as many as 2,401 people were found positive for Covid-19 in Gurugram. Also, the tally breached the 80,000-mark to climb to 81,725.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-covid-cases-at-25462-cm-lg-meet-today-on-more-curbs/articleshow/82136400.cms||AlokKNMishra

This would be one of the rare instances where a JV of a PSU has changed hands through a corporate insolvency process. The Kolkata bench of the NCLT has approved the resolution plan. Balmer Lawrie is a market leader in steel barrels, industrial greases and speciality lubricants, corporate travel and logistics services. It also has significant presence in most other businesses, it operates, viz, leather chemicals, logistics infrastructure etc in its 154 years of existence. Om Logistics, the highest bidder during the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) for Transafe Services (TSL), has proposed to pay Rs 49 crore, whereas the total admitted claim was around Rs 533 crore. The secured financial creditors will have to take a haircut of 87%. The resolution plan submitted by Om Logistics was, however, approved by 100% votes of the Committee of Creditors (CoC) of Kolkata-based TSL, a joint venture of Balmer Lawrie & Co (BL) and Balmer Lawrie — Van Leer (BLVL) with each holding 50% shares. The firm is specialised in the design and manufacturing of containers and tanks. Western Carriers (India), which offered Rs 47.6 crore, was declared the H2 bidder. Syndicate Bank, merged into Canara Bank from April, 2020, had moved NCLT against TSL on the ground that the company had committed default. Other financial creditors are: Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, Karur Vysya Bank and Bank of India, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/om-logistics-frontrunner-to-take-over-balmer-lawrie-jv-from-nclt/articleshow/82134449.cms||---
