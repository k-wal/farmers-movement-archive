The 2021 digital play is an upgraded version of the original which was previously staged offline in Bengaluru, in 2013. Now, Mallika has reimagined the same play tweaking it to keep the current times in mind. "Seven years ago, in my play Hidden in Plain Sight, I was thinking about disconnection, miscommunication and falling off the grid. Now, with the pandemic and subsequent lockdown, similar real-life stories have sprung up from the isolation and disconnection, and it was something that I felt needed to be addressed again. The piece is now being presented with a renewed sense of urgency and relevance in a digital avatar," she says. With performances at the January 2013 edition of the International Theatre Festival of Kerala (ITFoK), the Windermere Theatre Festival in Bareilly and Jagriti Theatre in June 2013, curating and tweaking the content for a digital audience must have been quite a challenge for Mallika. "It has certainly been a challenge to do a stage performance for the digital medium and establish a human connection between the audience and performer. The challenge was that I did not want to fall into the space of cinema nor wanted it to be a zoom session/call. I wanted to find middle ground and look at how to communicate our need to be together and find that human connection," adds Mallika. For the digital version, she has collaborated with performer and writer Ram Ganesh Kamatham to develop a new form of storytelling. The story quite effortlessly traces the life of three women battling anxiety, dealing with being isolated and cut off from human connection, and how their lives intertwine with another key character who personifies a Mailer Daemon (response system in an email server). "There’s a girl in the apartment who’s possibly losing her mind. Then there's Sandhya who is trekking in the mountains but can’t find her freedom. There's also Mr LPs Raghuraman who loses her head at a party. And the fourth is a fictitious character who is a program - Mailer Demon - and responding to all the emails directed to her is a full time job. This piece in its entirety speaks of well-being in the face of isolation," says Mallika. The 60-minute-long play would be streamed digitally on April 23, 24 and 25, has been designed and performed by Mallika. "A small portion of the digital performance has been kept interactive. "We have tried to mimic a live interaction moment with our digital audience which would happen in a physical theatre performance," she wraps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/mallika-prasad-sinha-reimagines-a-previously-staged-performance/articleshow/82141110.cms||Joyeeta Chakravorty

A team at Apple devoted to reviewing whether apps submitted to its App Store conform to its policies has approved a modified version of Parler, which had become popular with conservatives before it was booted off online marketplaces. The news came from a copy of a letter from Apple posted on Twitter by US Representative Ken Buck of Colorado. "Parler has proposed updates to its app and the app's content moderation practices," read the letter signed by Apple senior director of government affairs in the Americas Timothy Powderly. "Its proposed updated app will be approved for reinstallment in the App Store." Apple, queried by AFP, offered no additional comment. Powderly noted in the letter that Apple stood by its independent decision to remove Parler from the App Store in the aftermath of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol by supporters of former president Donald Trump. Buck said in his tweet that Parler's return to the App Store is "a huge win for free speech." Parler relaunched in February after being forced offline over incitements to violence on the platform. Parler, which calls itself "the free speech social network", came under scrutiny following the deadly attack on the US Capitol. Apple and Google pulled the network's app from their download platforms and Amazon's web hosting service cut ties as well. Powderly said in the letter that Apple had found many posts violating the iPhone maker's rules about app content moderation. He said there were "posts that encouraged violence, denigrated various ethnic groups, races and religions, glorified Nazism, and called for violence against specific people." Apple chief executive Tim Cook said early this year that Parler could return the App Store if it changed how it moderates posts on the platform. Nevada-based Parler, which launched in 2018, operates much like Twitter, with profiles to follow and "parleys" instead of tweets. In its early days, the platform attracted a crowd of ultraconservative and even extreme-right users. It has since signed up many more traditional Republican voices. Parler fired its chief executive John Matze soon after the deadly attack on the US Capitol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/apple-to-let-tweaked-parler-back-in-app-store/articleshow/82150557.cms||---

"We think a lot of magic happens at the intersection of audio formats, as well as at the confluence of text, audio and video," Facebook app chief Fidji Simo said in a blog post. Facebook's plan to weave audio offerings into the social network comes as it works to prevent losing users to audio-only startup Clubhouse.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/facebook-unveils-big-audio-push-adding-podcasts/articleshow/82150572.cms||---

The scheme was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in January to support startups and help budding entrepreneurs pursue innovative ideas. Goyal said good ideas oftenÂ get bought out by international venture capitalists at throwaway prices. "The idea behind the scheme is to ensure adequate availability of funds, particularly to startups with good ideas in different fields. I do hope that this scheme will support our domestic entrepreneurs and their business ideas that often cannot take off due to the absence of critical capital at an early stage," Goyal said while launching the scheme. He also exuded confidence that the scheme will secure seed funding, inspire innovation, support transformative ideas, and facilitate implementation of those ideas. He added that smaller towns are often deprived of adequate funding and this scheme will create a robust startup ecosystem in Tier 2 and Tier 3 regions of India. It will be implemented from April 1, 2021. The Rs 945 crore corpus will be divided over the next four years for providing seed funding to eligible startups through eligible incubators across India. The government has constituted an Experts Advisory Committee(EAC) which will be responsible for the overall execution and monitoring of the scheme. Over 7,500 new startups are incorporated every year and it is essential to provide seed funding to startups with innovative ideas to conduct their 'Proof of Concept'. The scheme is being launched by DPIIT (Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade) to support this early-stage startup funding. It would provide financial assistance to startups for Proof of Concept, prototype development, product trials, market entry and commercialization. The scheme aims to support an estimated 3,600 entrepreneurs through 300 incubators. The online portal created by DPIIT for the scheme will allow incubators to apply forÂ funds under it.Â Grants of up to Rs 5 crore shall be provided to the eligible incubators selected by the EAC. The selected incubators would provide grants of up to Rs 20 lakh for validation of Proof of Concept, or prototype development, or product trials to startups. Further, investments of up to Rs 50 lakh will be provided to the startups for market entry, commercialization, or scaling up through convertible debentures or debt-linked instruments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/startup-india-seed-fund-scheme-to-support-domestic-entrepreneurs-their-business-ideas-piyush-goyal/articleshow/82150586.cms||---

It further said an investment adviser cannot avail reimbursement of any amount for the services given to its clients from the asset management companies (AMCs) whose direct plans are being sold by it to clients. The clarifications have been given as part of an informal guidance sought by Paytm Money Ltd (PML) regarding Sebi's investment advisers (IA) norm. PML said currently it does not charge advisory or execution fees and intends to avail of reimbursement of the service-related out of pocket expenses such as KYC, technology hosting, platform maintenance etc from AMCs whose direct plans it is selling. This is because PML is bearing the cost that the AMC would have borne in case the investments were directly routed through them. It has asked Sebi to clarify whether availing such reimbursement from AMCs is in violation of the investment advisers norm. In its reply made public on Monday, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said that an investment adviser may provide implementation services to the clients in securities market. This is subject to the condition that "investment advisers shall ensure that no consideration including any commission or referral fees, whether embedded or indirect or otherwise, by whatever name called is received, directly or indirectly, at investment adviser's group or family level for the said service, as the case may be". It further said such implementation services need to be provided only through direct schemes or products in the securities market. Also, the client need not to be under any obligation to avail implementation services offered by the investment adviser. The Sebi rules restrict a registered IA or its group of family to charge any implementation fees from its clients, the regulator said. In view of this, Sebi said "PML cannot avail reimbursement of any amount for the services given to its clients from the AMCs whose direct plans are being sold by them to clients". As per the regulator, an investment adviser should not render any investment advice until consent is received from its clients on the terms and conditions. Further, in order to ensure enforceability, an agreement was mandated between IA and the client incorporating the terms and conditions in the document as specified by Sebi. "...merely seeking an electronic consent and sharing the same with the clients on their registered email address may not be considered as sufficient compliance with IA regulations," the regulator noted. With regard to Principal Officer, Sebi said a member of the committee (including a department head in charge of advisory business) appointed by the board of IA to oversee the advisory functions and operations cannot be the Principal Officer of the IA, unless he is also the managing director or executive chairman of the board or equivalent management body of the IA. Noting this position is based on the information furnished, Sebi said "different facts or conditions might lead to a different interpretation". "This letter does not express a decision of the board on the question referred," the regulator added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/investment-advisers-cannot-charge-implementation-fee-for-advisory-clients-sebi/articleshow/82150643.cms||---

The company's shares, which were at the heart of a Reddit-driven trading frenzy, jumped 9% in premarket trade on Monday after GameStop said Sherman would resign on or before July 31 and that it had started looking for a successor. Reuters had earlier reported that GameStop's board was working with an executive headhunter on the CEO search and that its directors had spoken to potential candidates from gaming, e-commerce and technology sectors. GameStop also said Sherman had refused to receive compensation for his role as a director, both before and after separation date, and had agreed to cancel his 2020 performance-vested restricted stock award. Sherman has already forfeited more than 587,000 shares for failing to meet his performance targets, a regulatory filing showed last week. Sherman's move to step down comes as Ryan Cohen, co-founder and former CEO of online pet food company Chewy Inc, tightens his grip on GameStop after taking over as chairman earlier this month. Cohen's RC Ventures owns nearly 13% of GameStop, according to Refinitiv data. GameStop's former CFO, Jim Bell, and former chief customer officer, Frank Hamlin, are among the senior executives who have left the company in recent weeks. GameStop has been in the process of transforming itself into an e-commerce firm that can compete with big retailers such as Walmart Inc, as well as technology companies like Microsoft Corp and Sony Corp. Separately, Bloomberg reported that the man known as “Roaring Kitty” on social media, whose online posts helped spark January’s trading frenzy in GameStop, exercised call options on the stock to acquire 50,000 more shares at a strike price of $12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/gamestop-loses-ceo-in-latest-management-shakeup/articleshow/82150740.cms||---
---||India||Pakistan: TLP protesters release 11 abducted police officers||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s far-right Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) group has released 11 police officers, including a district superintendent of police (DSP), who were taken hostage during violent clashes in the eastern city of Lahore on Sunday, Pakistan interior minister Sheikh Rasheed said on Monday. In a video message, the minister said "a lot of progress" had been made in the first round of negotiations with the TLP members. "They have released the 11 policemen they had abducted and the people of the TLP have gone into the Rehmat ul Alimeen mosque and police have also moved back," Rasheed said, hoping that the rest of the matter would be resolved with the proscribed group in the second round of talks. "These negotiations were held successfully by the (Pakistan) Punjab government," he said. According to sources privy to the matter, Pakistan Punjab governor Chaudhry Sarwar and the provincial police chief, Inam Ghani, were part of the government team that met the TLP. The TLP workers, sources revealed, had made four demands: the expulsion of the French ambassador, the release of party chief Saad Hussain Rizvi, the removal of the ban on the party, and the release of activists arrested as well as the FIRs against them revoked. Regarding the first demand, the government said it would take the matter to parliament. However, the government asked for time on TLP’s demands to release Rizvi, take back the FIRs and lift the ban on the party. The government’s representatives said they would convey the TLP’s demands to higher-ups, sources said. Meanwhile, several religious parties, including the Maulana Fazlur Rehman-led Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam and Jamaat-i-Islami, called a strike on Monday in solidarity with TLP. The authorities, meanwhile, raised security levels in the capital, Islamabad, and elsewhere. On Monday, PM Imran Khan appeared to address the issue during an event in Islamabad. "In our country it is a great misfortune that many times our political parties and religious parties use Islam wrongly and use it such that they cause damage to their own country," he said. Khan said he had started a campaign with the heads of other Muslim countries to present the case of Prophet Muhammad’s honour at international forums. Last week, the Pakistani government had designated the TLP a "terrorist" organisation under its anti-terrorism law, with the authorities saying they would move to have the Election Commission delist the group as a political party. That move came after days of violent TLP protests in Lahore, Karachi, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Multan, Peshawar and elsewhere as the group demanded the release of its chief, Saad Rizvi, from police custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pakistan-tlp-protesters-release-11-abducted-police-officers/articleshow/82150745.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The announcement came just ahead of UK health secretary Matt Hancock announcing in the House of Commons that India would from 4 am UK time (8.30 am IST) on Friday 23 April be added to the red list, meaning anyone who is not a UK or Irish citizen or resident cannot enter the UK if they have been in India in the previous 10 days. Downing Street and the ministry of external affairs said the decision to cancel the Johnson’s trip was a joint decision.

Often teams did the RT-PCR test as per the original schedule and the schedule of the tests has been disrupted. “As such it has been decided to waive the requirements for the matches to be played on 20th April and 21st April 2021, considering the peculiar situation,” GFA secretary Jovito Lopes wrote to the clubs on Monday. The GFA had made it mandatory from the start of the league for the 12 participating teams to conduct tests for their players and officials every 15 days. The teams have already spent heavily on the tests and were taken aback with the decision. “How could GFA be so careless and allow players to take the field without Covid-19 tests? Cases in Goa are rising alarmingly and the GFA does not seem to care,” one senior club official told TOI immediately after the email was sent on Monday. However, GFA soon realised its mistake and sent another email, after being directed by president Churchill Alemao. “The president has directed since there is an unprecedented spurt in Covid-19 positive cases, the safety of the player is of paramount importance and as such the need to continue observing the SOPs which have been in force. “The president has directed that the mail be withdrawn immediately and teams requested to continue with the RT-PCR tests for the safety of the players, officials,” GFA said in its second correspondence. Churchill Brothers FC are scheduled to face Youth Club of Manora at Rosary ground, Navelim, while relegation-threatened Velsao SCC will take on Dempo SC at Duler Football Stadium in Mapusa on Tuesday. Top of the standings Sporting Clube de Goa take on Guardian Angel SC at Duler while Salgaocar FC, who are also in fray of the title, meet Sesa FA at Navelim on Wednesday. There seems to be no slowing down with people testing positive for Covid-19 in the state. A total of 940 new cases were detected on Monday and a record 17 deaths. With such a short notice to get the test results done, clubs are now finding it difficult. “The GFA should have given sufficient time before rescheduling the postponed matches,” said one club official. “With rising cases, it is becoming difficult to get the test results within 24 hours and there is a possibility we could miss key players if the results don’t arrive on time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-pro-league-gfa-waives-covid-19-tests-alemao-soon-revokes-decision/articleshow/82151079.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

The state government declared the standard operating procedure (SOP) for MCZs in an order issued on Sunday under the break the chain initiative, launched to stem the rise of Covid-19 cases, which have seen a spurt in the recent weeks. The government said a MCZ means any delineated area so declared by local disaster management authority (DMA). The government said if the DMA is of the view that there is a willful default on part of residents leading to their housing society being declared a MCZ, it may levy a fine on them that may collectively go up to Rs 10,000. If residents continue to display non-compliance towards Covid-19-appropriate behaviour, the DMA may impose further exemplary fines as it deems fit, the order said. In cases where the DMA is of the opinion that spread of Covid-19 has arisen due to fault of MCZ residents, it may order recovery of all the expenditure borne by it in enforcing these constraints from the residents or societies (of MCZ), the government said. Any cooperative housing society having more than 5 Covid-19 positive cases (who are present in the housing society/building) will be declared as a micro containment zone. In case there are multiple number of buildings in the CHS, local DMA has to decide whether all the cases are in such a limited area that can be practically isolated (no porous boundary) so that this SOP is strictly implementable and if so they may declare that as MCZ. The local authority may take appropriate decisions on case-to-case basis," it said. However, all the common utilities must be closed down even if one building out of multiple buildings in the society is declared MCZ, the government said. The government said the local DMA shall establish clear entry and exit points for MCZ. There will be strict perimeter control in place to ensure that there is no outward or inward unchecked movement from and to MCZ except for medical or other emergencies, it said. Garbage of the house having positive cases to be collected and disposed separately as per the guidelines of the local authority, the government said. Milk, medicines and other essential products bought through e-commerce must be delivered at a common place like the lobby or main entrance of the housing society, it said. Outside maids, domestic helps, drivers and others may be disallowed by DMA, even if they are permitted in general in their respective jurisdiction, the order said. These may be allowed, however, if they are residents within the same MCZ and do not commute outside the zone, the government said. Private security personnel may be allowed to commute in and out, but they should be given PPE by the society while being on the campus, the order said. "Swimming pools, gyms and common areas shall be strictly closed within the MCZ. Services related to medical requirements of the pet animals in the housing society are essential services. "DMA may declare specific regulations of the same, the government said. It said details of persons moving out of the micro containment zone will be recorded. A locality can be de-notified as a micro containment by the local DMA after 10 days of it being notified, subject to no new cases being found positive in the CHS in the last five days, the government order said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-maharashtra-govt-issues-sop-on-micro-containment-zone/articleshow/82151722.cms||---

The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by PM Narendra Modi, which noted that satisfactory coverage of vulnerable groups currently eligible for vaccination was expected by April 30, setting the stage for a more liberalised approach to inoculation against Covid-19 in terms of pricing as well as age-determined eligibility. Pharma companies manufacturing in India will be free to sell 50% of their production to states and hospital chains at a pre-fixed price for vaccination of people above 18 outside the central programme. States will be free to decide the age bar for any category of people above 18 (for example a particular state may adopt the 18-plus norm or set an age bar of its choosing). Meanwhile, the central programme of vaccinating all above 45 will continue with the shots given for free in government hospitals. Read AlsoEveryone above 18 can get Covid-19 vaccine from May 1 in phase 3 of vaccination drive: HighlightsEveryone above 18 years of age will be eligible to get the Covid-19 vaccine in phase 3 of the vaccination drive May 1 onwards, announced the Centre on Monday as the government liberalises India's vaccination strategy amidst a surging second wave of coronavirus. The decision to liberalize the phase 3States and hospital chains will be allowed to procure vaccines directly from manufacturers and even contract them from abroad from candidates that are approved for use by the Centre under its recently announced policy where shots approved by well-known regulators like FDA and MHRA or those listed with the WHO can be given emergency approval in India.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); The three streams of vaccinations will mean that shots being delivered by private hospital chains will be costlier than the current Rs 250 rate. Vaccines procured and delivered by states will be priced by the respective administrations. The effort, keeping in mind a plateauing and a dip in daily vaccination, is to boost the pace of inoculation by liberalising procurement and widening eligibility. India has administered 12.69 crore doses since the rollout of the vaccination drive on January 16 with prioritisation of health and frontline workers in the first phase, followed by those above 60 and then 45-plus in subsequent phases.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); The revised norms create a role for private hospitals or vaccination providers as they are seen as being critical to the success of the effort to inoculate the population as quickly as possible. Vaccine manufacturers will be asked to pre-set a price for the shots which will then be applicable for all buyers in the private sector. Vaccine makers will have to transparently make an advance declaration of the price for 50% supply that would be available to state governments and in the open market before May 1, the government said. Based on this price, state governments, private hospitals and even industrial or corporate establishments will be able to procure vaccine doses.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); From its share, the Centre will allocate vaccines to states and UTs based on criteria of extent of infection (number of active Covid cases) and performance (speed of vaccination). A state's record of wastage of vaccines will also be a criterion and will affect supplies negatively. Based on such criteria, state-wise quota will be decided. India’s vaccine production is expected to increase substantially over the next few months with Serum Institute of India expected to increase production to nearly 100 million next month against a monthly capacity to produce 60-70 million doses at present. SII is likely to ramp up its capacity further by August.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); The production capacity of locally developed vaccine Covaxin will be doubled by May-June and then increased nearly 6-7 fold by July-August. It is expected to reach nearly 10 crore doses per month by September from 1 crore in April. The government has drawn up an augmentation plan which will be implemented through expansion of capacity at Bharat Biotech as well as public sector manufacturing units. Besides, imported vaccines are likely to be available in the open market soon.

---||India||India’s active cases cross 2 million, double in last 10 days||NEW DELHI: India now has more than 2 million (20 lakh) officially recorded active cases of Covid-19, currently the second-highest number in the world after the US. The count crossed the grim milestone on Monday, having nearly doubled in just the last 10 days. Active cases have seen nearly a 3.5-fold increase in April, rising from around 5.8 lakh on March 31 to 20.3 lakh on Monday (April 19). High growth in active cases is directly linked to a sharp rise in new cases. A large pool of active patients puts the healthcare system under stress and increases the probability of a higher number of fatalities. India recorded 1,693 deaths from the virus on Monday, the highest single-day toll so far. On Sunday, 1,624 fatalities were reported, as per TOI's data. There were 2,56,990 fresh Covid-19 cases, a slight drop from the record tally of over 2.75 lakh on Sunday. Cases dip every Monday due to lower testing and staff shortages over the weekend. However, this Monday, the drop wasn't very sharp and the positivity rate rose in many states, indicating that the rise in cases is likely to continue at least over the next few days. Read AlsoCovid-19: Vaccines opened for 18+; states, companies, private hospitals to get 50% of suppliesIn a big step to accelerate the pace of vaccination, the Centre on Monday permitted anyone above 18 to receive anti-Covid shots from May 1, opening options for states, hospital chains as well as corporate houses to procure and vaccinate all eligible recipients.As per worldometers.info, only the US has a higher number of active cases than India at 6.8 million. Brazil has the third-largest number at a little less than 1.2 million. Unlike India, active cases in the US and Brazil are on the decline. Despite the slight decline in fresh cases from the previous day's count, seven states reported their highest ever surge in cases on Monday. These included Madhya Pradesh, where 12,897 new infections were detected, Rajasthan (11,967), Gujarat (11,403), Bengal (8,426), Odisha (4,445), Jharkhand (4,290) and Himachal (1,695). In deaths, Delhi recorded its highest single-day toll from the pandemic at 240. Maharashtra continued to report the highest toll in the country, with 351 deaths in the last 24 hours. Among other states recording a high number of fatalities were Chhattisgarh, where 175 deaths were reported, Uttar Pradesh (167 deaths), Gujarat (117), Punjab (84), Karnataka (81) and Madhya Pradesh (79).  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Meanwhile, states, where cases had been low till recently, registered the maximum rise in infections last week (April 12-18). Bihar logged the highest growth among the bigger states, with fresh cases rising 175% (2.75 times) over the previous week. The state logged 40,888 last week as opposed to 14,852 in the preceding seven days. Similarly, the growth in cases in Odisha was 172% and Assam posted a 145% spike. With cases exploding in the north, Delhi saw infections rise by 163% and UP by 157%. Elsewhere, weekly cases more than doubled in Kerala (126%), MP (123%), Haryana (113%), Bengal (112%), Rajasthan (108%) and Andhra (107%). Nationally, weekly cases rose by 63%. In absolute numbers, Maharashtra logged 4,32,093 during the week, followed by UP (1,59,528), Delhi (1,28,263) and Chhattisgarh (1,01,543).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indias-active-cases-cross-2-million-double-in-last-10-days/articleshow/82152733.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

Dr Vinod Paul, member of the NITI Aayog and chairman of the government’s empowered group on Covid management, said relaxation of norms will let the country fast-track greenlighting of foreign-made vaccines that have been granted emergency-use approvals in other countries. He added that production of both Covaxin and Covishield is also being scaled up. “We are expecting current production levels of Covaxin and Covishield to be scaled up, as has been committed by their manufacturers (Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute). We also expect Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson to seek Indian licence as soon as possible," Dr Paul said. Read AlsoCovid-19: Vaccines opened for 18+; states, companies, private hospitals to get 50% of suppliesIn a big step to accelerate the pace of vaccination, the Centre on Monday permitted anyone above 18 to receive anti-Covid shots from May 1, opening options for states, hospital chains as well as corporate houses to procure and vaccinate all eligible recipients.The Russian-made Sputnik-V vaccine is also likely to be available in India after May. Some of these foreign-made vaccines need very low storage temperatures - from -25°C to -70°C. Dr Paul said, depending on approvals, some of these shots can be deployed in urban centres. The National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration has recommended that vaccines for Covid-19, that have been developed and manufactured in foreign countries (and added to the WHO's emergency-use listing), may be granted approvals in India. These approvals will be accompanied by relevant checks.

They said the company has sought an early meeting of the subject"The first 100 beneficiaries of these foreign vaccines will be assessed for a week for safety outcomes, before they are rolled out as part of the larger immunization programme in the country," Dr Paul said. The addition of more vaccines to India's basket will let the government cover more age groups. "Better the availability, the more age groups we can cover. The government is looking to first cover the 45-plus group and then, depending on availability, expand the drive to cover others, which has been the demand of many states," he said. He added that while more Covishield doses are expected, the supply of Covaxin will see considerable improvement in the future following production approvals to public sector units.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-vaccine-availability-will-improve-by-july-says-niti-aayogs-vinod-paul/articleshow/82153016.cms||Nisha Nambiar

A child falls on a railway track, an express train thunders towards him, the boy’s blind mother hollers for help fearing the worst... and then, in one fell swoop, a saviour appears from nowhere and plucks the kid out of harm’s way. This heart-rending scene of valour played out at Vangani railway station, about 100km from CSMT, on Saturday evening. It has been captured on CCTV cameras at the station. The Udyan Express was speeding when railway employee Mayur Shelke (30) was alerted by the cries of a woman standing on the platform, screaming helplessly. Shelke, whose job is to check railway signals, noticed that her son, a 6-year-old, had slipped onto the railway track below. Even as the boy tried unsuccessfully to vault over to get onto the platform, his mother was weeping out aloud, still staring blankly. Shelke figured that the mother was blind. All along, the train kept hurtling down. Without a second thought, Shelke raced towards the boy, bundled him onto the platform, and then swiftly clambered onto it himself. Within seconds, the Udyan Express had crossed Vangani station, and was on its way towards Bengaluru. This act of the Central Railway pointsman—a field employee whose job is to check if train signals are functioning right—has won him the gratitude of the visually impaired woman who was hugging her boy and expressing her gratitude to Shelke, said Central Railway’s chief PRO Shivaji Sutar. The act earned him plaudits from railway minister Piyush Goyal who called up Shelke to praise him for his altruistic act. TOI has learned that Goyal told Shelke that no reward can ever compensate him for his humane act. Goyal tweeted: ‘Very proud of Mayur Shelke, Railwayman... who has done an exceptionally courageous act, risked his own life & saved a child’s life.’ Asian Institute of Transport Development has announced an award of Rs 50,000 for the alertness and courage that Shelke displayed.The boy’s mother Sangeeta Shirsat was, of course, extremely thankful to Shelke. “Can’t thank him enough... He took a huge risk to save my son’s life...” Shelke, who joined the railways six months ago, played down his act. “I was on duty when I saw the boy. For a second, I hesitated... but then made my mind and rush towards him before the train could get there.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/railway-pointsman-risks-life-to-save-6-year-old-boy-on-tracks/articleshow/82153540.cms||Manthank Mehta

Procurement had suffered last year because of the Covid-induced lockdown. The food ministry said the procurement of wheat has so far benefited 11.6 lakh farmers with an MSP value of Rs 24,037.6 crore. It said this is for the first time, Punjab farmers have started receiving payments directly into their bank accounts against sale of their rabi crops. In the last one week, about Rs 202.7 crore has transferred directly into Punjab farmers’ accounts. The Centre has plans to procure around 427 lakh tonnes of wheat in the current RMS at MSP in the central pool. The ministry said procurement has picked up pace in the last week and is going on briskly in the procuring states and UTs of Punjab, Haryana, UP, Chandigarh, MP, Rajasthan and other states. “Out of 121.7 lakh tonnes, major contribution has been made by Haryana — 44.8 lakh tonnes (36.8%), Punjab — 41.8 lakh tonnes (34.2%) and MP — 28.5 lakh tonnes ( 23.4%) as on April 18,” the ministry said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/11-6-lakh-farmers-have-got-24k-cr-as-msp-through-wheat-procurement/articleshow/82153583.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Covid-19: HC wants 5 UP cities shut but Yogi govt rules out lockdown||PRAYAGRAJ/LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh government on Monday refused to go for a lockdown, saying it was necessary to protect livelihoods of people, after the Allahabad High Court directed the state government to enforce closure of government and private establishments in five cities -- Lucknow, Varanasi, Prayagraj, Kanpur and Gorakhpur -- till April 26 to break the lethal Covid chain. Hours after the high court directive, the UP government issued a statement, saying a “full lockdown would not be implemented in cities right now. People are voluntarily shutting establishments.” “In light of high court order, it is to be said Corona cases have gone up in the state and there is need for strictness in controlling spread of the virus. The government has taken several steps and in future will also take more severe steps,” a government spokesperson said. Hearing a PIL on Covid care, a division bench comprising Justice Siddhartha Varma and Justice Ajit Kumar observed: “We are conscious that before imposing a lockdown, the government has to work out modalities. But if we have not imposed a lockdown, it does not mean we do not believe in it. We direct the government to consider imposition of a complete lockdown in the state for at least two weeks. This would not only break the Covid chain, but also give respite to health workers.” The court also directed the government to go robust on vaccination. The next hearing was scheduled for April 26. The bench, however, clarified that these directions were nowhere close to a complete lockdown, while keeping financial, industrial and scientific institutions, medical and health departments and essential services, including municipal functions and public transport out of the ambit of curbs. “If popular government has its own political compulsions in not checking public movement during this pandemic, we cannot remain passive spectators. Public health is top priority and any complacency will cause havoc. We can’t shirk away from our constitutional duty to save innocent people from the pandemic, which is spreading due to the negligence of a few,” the court observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hc-orders-closure-of-5-uttar-pradesh-cities-govt-says-not-possible/articleshow/82153751.cms||---
---||India||Rich brats speeding in high-end cars can’t seek relief: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a plea by Kolkata’s biryani baron Akhtar Parwez seeking bail for his son Raghib, who is accused of causing death of two Bangladeshi nationals while driving his Jaguar F-Pace at a speed of 130-135 kph on August 17, 2019. Parwez’s counsel Kapil Sibal told a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hemant Gupta that Raghib suffers from Bipolar Affective Disorder and needed heavy medication for the mental illness, that he had cooperated with the investigations leading to filing of chargesheet and that no purpose would be served to send him back to jail after a year of being kept at home on interim bail, especially when the Covid-19 pandemic was raging. The bench reminded Sibal of the infamous BMW hit-and-run case involving Sanjeev Nanda and said rich brats driving their high-end cars at breakneck speed could not seek concessions. “If he is of unsound mental health, who allowed him to drive the Jaguar at such high speed? The parents in such cases need to be sent behind bars,” the bench said. The bench also said there was no determination by the trial court that Raghib was of unsound mind. Sibal said, “The chargesheet was filed on September 18, 2019. Raghib was in jail for eight months and was granted interim bail in April last year. What is the purpose of sending him to jail at this stage when the pandemic is raging? There is no allegation that he has influenced witnesses.” But the bench said Raghib fled to Dubai immediately after the accident. “You also attempted to change the driver. His conduct does not warrant any relief,” it said. Sibal said he had come back to India within 48 hours and surrendered to police for investigations. Raghib had come back after his elder brother Arsalan was arrested by Kolkata police for the accident. Refusing relief, the bench said Raghib should face trial and it was for the competent court to determine his mental condition. “We appreciate your (Sibal’s) arguments. But we are not able to persuade ourselves to agree with you on the relief you have sought,” the bench said and dismissed the father’s plea. Parwez, through advocate Ankur Chawla, said, “The trial is not likely to conclude shortly as the prosecution has cited 63 witnesses and voluminous evidence which is required to be recorded and sending Raghib to jail at this stage would be punitive in nature and contrary to the petitioner’s fundamental right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the the Constitution of India.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rich-brats-speeding-in-high-end-cars-cant-seek-relief-supreme-court/articleshow/82153893.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Dr Singh submitted that neither mild nor moderate or even severe patients undergoing treatment at AIIMS-P are given this injection as there is no study to prove that it saves lives of Covid-19 patients. “It’s not a wonder drug. There is no clinical study to prove its effectiveness in Covid-19. We don’t give it to our patients,” Dr Singh submitted. AIIMS-Patna counsel Binay Kumar Pandey had also submitted a brochure of treatment protocol. State health society’s executive director Manoj Kumar kept mum when the division bench of Justices Chakradhari Sharan Singh and Mohit Kumar Shah asked him why then the state government placed an order for Remdesivir worth Rs6.49 crore as the money could be utilised for other purposes at this crisis hour. The court also asked why the government was not highlighting the fact about the injection among common public. Even the lawyers, including advocate general Lalit Kishore representing the state government, were surprised over the AIIMS-P submissions about Remdesivir. Health department principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit on Saturday had submitted that emergency procurement of Remdesivir was being done by invoking National Disaster Management Act. The court had taken judicial notice of the acute shortage of the drug in the state and its blackmarketing that day. The high court on Monday vented its ire on the state government for not having any comprehensive action plan and submitting the same before the court for tackling the present serious situation of Covid-19. “Don’t hide your inefficiency,” the bench observed orally. Besides, the high court expressed annoyance over lack of daily briefing to the media. The court directed the AIIMS-director and Bihar Human Rights Commission secretary to visit NMCH and tell how the beds for Covid-19 patients could be increased there and submit a report for next hearing on Wednesday. It also directed BHRC secretary to conduct a surprise inspection of any hospital treating Covid-19 patients to see if facilities were present there or not. The court also sought details about availability of oxygen in all hospitals from the state government, but its reply didn’t satisfy the bench. Counsel Sumeet Kumar Singh referred the letter of NMCH superintendent (in-charge) to health department for relieving him from duty over the oxygen crisis. The court also sought the view of AIIMS-P director on ventilators. He submitted that the cost of one ventilator is around Rs15 lakh and, instead, a high flow nasal oxygen therapy equipment worth around Rs3 lakh each could be purchased and installed for treating critical Covid-19 patients. The bench also directed the high court registrar general to submit a detailed report on the circumstances under which one of its assistant registrars, Gagan Mishra, died of Covid and if oxygen crisis was also a reason behind his death. Centre’s additional solicitor general KN Singh submitted that a team of five doctors and 15 nurses had reached the ESIC hospital at Bihta. The court directed the state government to immediately avail their services. Counsel Mrigank Mauli drew the bench’s attention towards a Covid-19 positive sub-judge’s situation as he needs oxygen but is unable to arrange it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/aiims-p-director-to-hc-remdesivir-not-a-life-saving-drug/articleshow/82150358.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Doctors at MLN Medical College, Prayargaj, are taking up virtual consultations with patients and their attendants. The medical consultation online is particularly helping those patients who were turned away by the hospitals or could not get treatment at a medical facility. Remarkably, Dr Tariq Mahmood, professor and head of the department of pulmonary medicine, MLN Medical College, is attending close to 150 calls every day from confirmed and probable Covid cases and their attendants for online consultation. Both probable and confirmed patients are sending their reports \ computed tomography (CT) scan report scan on WhatsApp number of doctor and seeking prescription and basic line of Covid management to protect and treat them from the deadly virus. “ Apart from my regular work at MLN medical college, I have been devoting more than eight hours to counsel confirmed and probable Covid cases through telemedicine and social media platforms,” said Dr Tariq. “Over 150 patients and their attendants are seeking prescription and basic line of Covid management to treat the confirmed and probable Covid cases,” he added. Dr Tariq also admitted that he has been attending the phone calls of some critical patients who don’t want to visit hospitals and sought help to get them treated despite suffering from acute pneumonia  and other serious respiratory disorders. Apart from confirmed cases, there has been a large number of probable Covid cases ( a probable case is an individual who has not had a confirmatory test performed but has a positive antigen test and clinical criteria of infection and is at risk for Covid-19 infection) who kept on dialling the doctors through tele-medicines and seeking guidance whether they should get admitted or home isolate after taking medicines. Till now, over 3,000 confirmed and probable Covid cases have made calls to doctors within a short span of 10 days and the strength of calls are increasing with every passing day. As hospitals are flooded with patients, the confirmed and probable Covid cases were dispatching their RT-PCR and CT Scan reports on the WhatsApp number of doctors and seeking virtual consultation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/doctors-offer-help-to-covid-patients-through-virtual-consultation/articleshow/82149838.cms||---

They also expect the Covid restrictions imposed in the state to continue for a longer period and the new session no better than the previous one. Shailendra Mohan Jha, the vice-principal of Gyan Niketan, said the extended closure of schools is likely to affect the revenue as the fee collection from students has completely hampered. “So far, the school administration has paid full salary to its staff in the last academic session, but we cannot say what will happen in this session,” he told this newspaper. “The most important thing that we observed during the short span of physical classes this year was that the students did not grasp the knowledge that they should have in their previous class, which is going to be a problem for them. So, this academic session, we are stressing more on home assignments,” he said. Don Bosco Academy principal Mary Alphonsa said the school administration has already prepared for the situation in this academic session as well and started online classes from April first week. “Students and teachers have become used to online classes. As far as the salaries of teachers are concerned, the school administration did not deduct any last time. But this time, there is no increment in salary due to the pandemic,” she said. St Dominic Savio’s High School principal Glenda Galstaun also shared similar views about the knowledge gap of students and school’s concern for revenue. “There is a difference between formal education where students are face-to-face with teachers and online teaching. Classroom teaching is important for the overall development of a child. However, because of this crisis, we are again forced to switch to online learning. We have seen that online teaching is not successful. It is just a stopgap arrangement. The children have already lost one year and this is the second year they are losing out,” Glenda said. School kids are also facing a tough time in coping with the new academic year. Sanjana Kashyap, a class VII student, said she acquired less than 60% knowledge in her previous class. “We faced so many interruptions and obstacles during the online classes that sometimes it became impossible to understand what the teachers was saying,” she said. Aniket Singh, a class IX student said, “There is a huge gap in syllabus of class VIII and IX. If the concept is not clear, it would affect our overall performance in this session and the next.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/schools-concerned-about-academic-revenue-losses/articleshow/82149821.cms||Faryal Rumi

Since last week, the steel plant has supplied nearly 400 metric tonnes (MT) of liquidised medical oxygen to Andhra Pradesh and other states. Another 400 MT are being prepared for supply by the end of this week. This liquid oxygen will then reach oxygen cylinder manufacturers and hospitals that have their own liquid to gas conversion plants. Speaking to TOI, a senior RINL-VSP official said “We know the pain of Covid-19 patients due to shortage in provision of oxygen during medical treatment as we lost many of our colleagues to the pandemic in the first and the second waves.” In the last financial year as well, RINL supplied 8,842 MT of oxygen as per requirement, the official added. Gandham Venkata Rao, a steel plant employee and president of Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), said nearly 20 VSP employees succumbed to Covid-19 while another five died of the disease in April this year. More than 100 VSP employees have been infected. According to RINL sources, an air separation plant (ASP) at VSP has five units of oxygen extraction plants for meeting the oxygen requirement of the 7.3 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) steel plant. Of these, three units have a capacity of 550 tonnes per day and the other two can produce 600 tonnes per day. Every day on average, the ASP produces 2,600 tonnes of oxygen gas for the plant’s operation and 100 tonnes of liquid oxygen that are reserved for emergency purposes. “We are now supplying the reserved oxygen only for Covid-19 purposes. This liquid gas will be filled into the tankers, which will be transported through Indian Railways’ support. The respective state governments can use this liquid oxygen for oxygen cylinder producers and hospitals,” the RINL official added. Speaking to TOI, B Srinivas, director of Vingas Industries Private Limited, Visakhapatnam, said that they produce seven cubic-meter oxygen cylinders, which can be directly attached to the beds of patients. They charge Rs 140 per cylinder from the hospital. “Production is slowly rising in our plant. The last highest number of cylinders was 1,616 cylinders. Last year on August 13, we reached 2,295 cylinders per day,” Srinivas said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vsp-emerges-as-lifeline-for-severe-covid-cases/articleshow/82149699.cms||V Kamalakara Rao

Begusarai DM Arvind Kumar Verma took an initiative in this regard and ensured that the closed private medical oxygen plant becomes functional. It has the capacity to produce 450 oxygen cylinders, containing 60 cubic metre of medical oxygen. "It will not only help to meet the requirement of all the hospitals in Begusarai but will hopefully fulfil the needs of hospitals in neighbouring districts like Khagaria also," the DM said. He added that the plant was closed for over two years owing to several issues, including non-payment of electricity bill. "Considering the urgent need to step up the supply of oxygen, I called several meetings of the owner of the plant and other officials and persons concerned and resolved the matter during the last two days, so that production from the plant can start again," he said. Incidentally, the oxygen gas plant at Begusarai which produces medical oxygen is the only unit situated here after Patna and Muzaffarpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/oxygen-plant-resumes-production-after-2-yrs-in-begusarai/articleshow/82150024.cms||Rajiv Kumar

---||Kolkata||Khardaha: TMC’s son of soil takes on ex-colleague||Khardaha: An assembly segment on the northern fringes of the city that gave the state two finance ministers is facing an identity crisis this time. A veteran TMC-turned-BJP leader from a neighbouring assembly segment is up against a Trinamool warhorse at Khardaha assembly segment this year where “development” and “outsider MLA” are prime issues. From 1987 to 2011, Khardaha was represented by Asim Dasgupta, a PHD from MIT who had been the state’s finance minister during the entire tenure of Left Front government. In the TMC regime, Dasgupta, who lives in Salt Lake, was succeeded by Amit Mitra, former FICCI secretary general who had defeated him in 2011 and has been serving as the finance minister since then. Mitra is a resident of Ballygunge. However, this year, Mitra (73) was dropped from the candidate list due to his age and ongoing Covid-19 pandemic as TMC fielded Kajal Sinha, a son of the soil, who has been a loyal party worker for two decades. He takes on turncoat Shilbhadra Dutta — the Barrackpore MLA (with a TMC ticket). “This assembly segment has always been a high profile constituency. But it has not made any difference to our lives. We have never seen the two MLAs in our area over the last three decades. They were so important that they never bothered to visit the place. The constituency may lose its VIP tag but the MLAs should be more approachable,” said Sailen Sarkar, a resident of Patulia, who complained of poor water supply in the area. What was once an industrial hub with a growing refugee colony, Khardaha, situated barely 21 kilometres from the heart of Kolkata, has witnessed a real estate boom in last ten years. But residents here said though some promoters and men associated with them have flourished, households in Talbanda, Bilkanda and Patulia areas still live in extreme poverty and lack basic amenities. Water and drainage is also the primary election issue for both BJP and CPM here. “The past MLAs have done nothing and turned this place into a village. People still don’t have water and proper electricity,” said Dutta, who defected to BJP last December. TMC’s Kajal Sinha said: “Amit Mitra has taken the urban portion of Khardaha to a different height. Once we come to office again, we will convert this place into an industrial hub,” said Sinha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/khardaha-tmcs-son-of-soil-takes-on-ex-colleague/articleshow/82150541.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Business||Northern Arc raises Rs 40 crore debt from Kotak Mahindra Bank||Chennai: City-based digital debt platform and non-banking finance company Northern Arc Capital has raised Rs 40 crore of debt financing from private lender Kotak Mahindra Bank, with an aim to lend and support under-banked retail households and micro-entrepreneurs with a monthly income below Rs 25,000. This is followed by a series of sanctions received from Development Finance Institutions to finance retail households, small businesses, and financial institutions. Since 2020, Northern Arc has attracted debt financing from an array of global DFIs and impact investors such as US International Development Finance Corporation, Asian Development Bank, Calvert Impact Capital, and FMO.Its COO Bama Balakrishnan said, “The transaction is a unique result of our structuring and product development capabilities combining with our extensive investor reach to help raise funding for our own balance sheet. While we usually adopt this approach to benefit smaller partner institutions, this deal is proof that it can help larger and higher rated NBFCs raise debt at better pricing.”This fundraising aims to cover the working capital needs of thousands of women entrepreneurs, along with mini-grid companies and micro-enterprises too. As of March 31, 2021, the company has enabled significant debt financing of around Rs 95,000 crore for its clients across microfinance, small business finance, affordable housing finance, vehicle finance, agriculture finance, consumer finance, fintech and mid-market corporates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/northern-arc-raises-rs-40-crore-debt-from-kotak-mahindra-bank/articleshow/82151183.cms||Mamtha Asokan

Several patients rushing here from the districts had to be refused admission due to lack of oxygen. The Hightech Hospital emergency ward stopped admitting new Covid 19 patients due to lack of sufficient oxygen cylinders. "We got about a hundred phone calls on Monday for admission but had to decline all of them owing to the lack of oxygen cylinders. Some of them even lost their temper and used abusive language, but we had no option," said Abhay Pandey, manager of Hightech hospital, adding that we suggested PMCH, NMCH or other government hospitals where the oxygen supply was better. Medizone hospital had to shift four patients to other hospitals due to oxygen scarcity. Its managing director Pankaj Kumar Mehta said the hospital had oxygen back up only for an hour which led the authorities to call the district administration which made available 30 cylinders. "It saved the lives of many, but it was not up to the daily requirement of 95 cylinders for 18 serious patients," he said. Finding no other option, we had to shift four patients to other hospitals to save their lives. "How could we see them dying for want of oxygen," he said. At least 25 critical patients had to be refused admission due to shortage of oxygen at Jagdish Memorial Hospital, said its managing director Alok Kumar. " Failing to get the adequate number of oxygen cylinders from Patna and Nalanda for saving the life of 30 admitted serious patients of Covid, I contacted a dealer of Ramgarh in Jharkhand who assured to make available by late evening," he said. "Pushpanjali hospital had discharged five patients in the morning due to the shortage of oxygen and declined to admit 10 new patients. Things improved after the Patna DDC made available 40 oxygen cylinders and it proved a boon for saving the lives of about 30 admitted patients," said its managing director Avinash Kumar Pandey. Dr Ravi Prakash, managing director of Atlantis hospital, said they have stopped admission of patients with low oxygen saturation due to limited and inadequate oxygen cylinders. "We declined many on this account and suggested to go for big government hospitals having their oxygen supply chain. Currently, 26 patients of Covid are admitted and we informed the district administration problems arising due to the oxygen crisis," added Dr Prakash. No problem of oxygen was reported from the Big Apollo hospital and its superintendent Dr Rajiv Ranjan Kumar said 41 Covid patients were under treatment there though only 36 beds were initially marked for Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/oxygen-crisis-over-200-patients-refused-admission-in-private-hospital/articleshow/82149735.cms||VK Tripathi

Her body with injury marks on the neck was later found inside a haystack outside her house in the Ujhani area of Budaun district on Monday.

Ujhani SHO Vinod Kumar told TOI, “The girl’s body was found under mysterious circumstances. Her family is yet to file a complaint. They have remained silent so far. We have sent the body for autopsy and are waiting for the report." The cops are now collecting all evidence to build a case. "The family’s role looks suspicious as they are not sharing much information. We are questioning the neighbours and will ensure that the truth comes out soon,” Kumar said.

He has been asked to take charge immediately. The state government has brought Jawahar Reddy back to handle Covid-19 operations keeping in view his experience in tackling the outbreak last year.

There are six ventilators in Aurangabad Sadar Hospital but none is functional for lack of trained technicians and doctors. The hospital has also been waiting for deputation of doctors and technicians in its ICU for the last three years. The severity of the situation can be gauged by the data furnished by the district administration as 372 new cases were registered on April 19 and 353 the previous day. Altogether 1,344 active cases were reported in the district as on Sunday. Aurangabad Red Cross Society secretary Deepak Kumar said the situation is difficult and the district is waiting for basic amenities to fight with Covid. “Ventilators are available in the Sadar hospital for over one year but no arrangements have been made for trained technicians to install and start these,” he said. District programme manager (DPM) of State Health Society, Dr Kumar Manoj said: “Requisitions for technician and doctors have been sent to the government and we are waiting for the response. Similarly, requisitions for doctors and technicians have also been sent for the ICU in Aurangabad Sadar Hospital.” He added: “RT-PCR test facility will be available by the end of this month as all basic infrastructure are available and installation work is in progress.” The DPM said there are three dedicated Covid care centres having 110 beds in Tarar village (40 beds), Siris (20 beds) and Aurangabad Block Office Colony (50 beds) . Daudnagar sub-divisional hospital is also ready as standby Covid care centre with the facility of 75 beds, Dr Manoj said. “Altogether 28 ambulances are available with district health society and there is a government guideline to make arrangements of rental ambulances in case of any necessity. There is no lack of oxygen in the district and only 13 patients were admitted in dedicated Covid care centres on Monday,” he said. Contrary to the claim of the health official, Red Cross Society’s Deepak said people were facing healthcare crisis. “All the oxygen cylinders of the Red Cross Society are engaged and the demand of oxygen cylinders is growing day by day. Maximum private clinics and hospitals in the district headquarters are closed and the people are suffering for the treatment of simple diseases," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ventilators-at-aurangabad-hosp-just-showpieces/articleshow/82150085.cms||---

All of them were being treated for the infection and breathed their last in the hospital. With two staff members of the secretariat succumbing to the virus in the last two days, the toll has now reached six. Meanwhile, around 40 more employees tested positive for the virus on Monday, taking the number of secretariat staff testing positive for the pandemic virus to 100. On Sunday, samples of 60 employees had returned positive. V Santhi Kumari (53), who worked as a section officer in the panchayat raj department, and ASN Murthy (50), who was a record assistant in the home department, succumbed to Covid-19 on Monday. Santhi Kumari’s husband Padma Rao, who was an assistant secretary in the finance department, had died of Covid on Saturday. The death of four employees in a span of just three days has left their colleagues in the secretariat in a state of shock. The virus has also spread its tentacles to the high court, which is situated just a few kilometres away from the secretariat at Velagapudi. Junior assistant Srilatha (35) and typist Subramanyam (48) were the two HC staff who died on Monday. They were admitted to different private hospitals with respiratory complications on Friday. While panchayat raj minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy expressed shock over the deaths, secretariat employees’ federation president K Venkatramireddy said the employees are under severe stress and demanded that the government should declare work from home for them with immediate effect. “Many senior officers are not coming to the secretariat and are working from home. The same facility should be extended to all employees,” he said. “We have requested the chief minister to intervene and take a call on the issue. The employees should be allowed to work from home for at least a fortnight and the rotation system can be implemented subsequently till the situation normalises,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/four-more-govt-employees-succumb-to-covid/articleshow/82149791.cms||Samdani MN

They also revealed CNG vehicles were preferred by motorists too, and were just 12% short of the number of diesel vehicles registered in 2019-20. The number of electric vehicles registered in 2020-21 totalled 1,442 compared with 672 in 2019-20. These included more than 90% two-wheelers, especially scooters. Statistics also showed of the total e-vehicles registered in 2020-21, as many as 885 were done between January and March this year. Maximum e-vehicles were registered in the island city (Tardeo RTO) at 463 followed by 426 at Andheri RTO, 321 at Borivli and 232 at Wadala. Transport experts said one of the reasons why people opted for e-vehicles was the rising cost of diesel and petrol, which neared the Rs 90 a litre and Rs 100 mark earlier this year, respectively. “It is also environmentally friendly, noiseless and smooth to ride, other than the cheaper fuel cost and maintenance,” said the owner of an e-scooter from Mulund. The city has seen a spurt in the number of shops selling e-vehicles while car manufacturers are also coming up with new models of e-cars and e-SUVs. The e-car also brings savings to your wallet. While petrol or diesel cars could cost Rs 3-4 per km, the e-car costs 50 paise. In a single fast charge, one can drive up to 120km, sources said. The government has also been encouraging setting up of charging stations in building premises and at petrol pumps (with subsidised rates of around Rs 6 per unit), but this infrastructure needs to be strengthened and experts suggested the need for a charging point at every 100 metres in the city. The latest statistics also showed that CNG vehicle registrations in Mumbai were inching closer to the number of diesel vehicles registered in the past one year. In 2020-21, the number of CNG vehicles registered totalled 10,363 compared to 11,785 diesel vehicles. So, CNG vehicles were just 12% less than diesel vehicles. By comparison, in 2019-20, the total CNG vehicles registered were 28% less than diesel (31,440 diesel vehicles compared to 22,548 CNG). “Those owning fleets of aggregator cabs are now purchasing CNG-run sedans instead of diesel. Also, there is a demand for hybrid CNG (petrol-CNG) cars which save operational costs and are good for intra-city drive,” said S K Raut, a car dealer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-e-vehicle-registrations-up-115-in-2020-21-as-fuel-prices-rise/articleshow/82149672.cms||Somit Sen

With the government asking district collectors to take a decision based on local conditions, district administrations are moving towards enforcement of partial lockdown. Municipal officials in Mangalagiri town in Guntur district directed traders to operate between 6 am to 11 am from Tuesday. Merchants have agreed to operate for limited hours to contain the virus spread. Mangalagiri constituency witnessed 152 Covid-19 positive cases on Sunday with 70 cases reported from Mangalagiri town and 65 in Tadepalle town. Another 17 cases were reported from neighbouring Duggirala mandal. With Mangalagiri region reporting 146 cases on Saturday, Sunday’s tally added to the case load in the area by nearly 300 in just 48 hours. Municipal authorities have also issued instructions to close down malls, function halls and theatres. Darshan for pilgrims at Panakala Sri Lakshminarasimha Swamy in Mangalagiri town had also been suspended for a fortnight. With the chief minister’s camp office located in Mangalagiri corporation limits, the local administration has opted to enforce restrictions on movement of public in markets and public places. Local legislator Alla Ramakrishna Reddy reviewed the situation with officials and directed them to impose Section 144 of the CrPC to restrict public gatherings. He also asked officials to ready a dedicated Covid-19 care centre in the town and suggested police restrict more than three people in autorickshaws. “Many autos are carrying more than 10 people leaving little space to breath. One positive patient is enough to make others fall sick,” said Ramakrishna Reddy. Meanwhile, district collector Vivek Yadav appointed tehsildars and municipal commissioners as incident commanders under the Disaster Management Act. “Ensure that Covid-19 protocols are followed in religious institutions, hotels, restaurants and business outlets,” said Yadav, adding that officials issue notices to and take action against those who violate guidelines.

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: ‘Use railway coaches to quarantine Covid patients’||NAGPUR: With the Maharashtra government demanding mandatory RT-PCR test from the railway passengers arriving from six sensitive states, demand has been raised to use modified coaches by the railways to quarantine such passengers testing positive at the railway station itself. The state government has sought RT-PCR test from passengers arriving from Goa, Gujarat, Kerala, Uttarakhand, Delhi, and Rajasthan. In view of the spurt in positive cases, Basant Shukla, general secretary of Bharatiya Yatri Kendra, has written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to utilize modified coaches as quarantine facility. There are 30 remodelled coaches with Nagpur Central Railway to quarantine Covid-19 patients. Of these coaches, 12 are in Nagpur, 13 in Wardha and 5 in Amla. “On the lines of Nandurbar where 20 coaches were put to use from Sunday, it is high time coaches in Nagpur are put to use now. Many railway employees are turning positive and they can also avail this facility. These coaches can also be used for passengers who are detected positive at the station,” said Shukla. In meanwhile, the Central Railway officers and staff working in the DRM office have been asked to work from home from April 20 to 25, in view of the spurt in coronavirus cases in the region. During this period, the control room, health care services, and security services will function as usual. During the period the staff has been asked to remain in contact with their respective officers. In the case where it is necessary to open the office for a short period, permission from the DRM will be taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/use-railway-coaches-to-quarantine-covid-patients/articleshow/82151668.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: ‘How are you, son?’ Woman calls up dead son from outside Covid hospital||AHMEDABAD: Poonam Solanki, in her late sixties, was recently spotted outside the 1,200-bed Covid hospital at Civil Hospital campus. A phone in hand, she was on a video call with her son Mahendra, 30. “How are you son? Do they give you good food? I'm praying for your fast recovery from corona,” the mother lovingly told the son on the other side of the call. She hung up after asking him to get well and come home soon. The call lasted for over five minutes. Poonam could be mistaken for one of the hundreds of relatives talking to their patients fighting Covid-19 infection inside the hospital wards -- the only difference was that Poonam's son had succumbed to the virus six months ago. Poonam's relative told TOI that Mahendra died on September 24 in 1,200-bed Covid-19 hospital and what Poonam sees on her screen is the last recording of the video call with him. “He ran a milk parlour in Narol. He was hospitalized here for about 5-6 days before he succumbed to the infection. He was very close to his mother. She is aware that her son is no more but there are days when, overcome with grief, she slips into denial and comes to the Civil Hospital in a bid to connect with him. As she is OK for the majority of days, we bring her to Civil on the same spot where she last chatted with Mahendra to give her some sense of calm, the relative said. “We know it is not healthy but we don't have a better way to help her handle her grief." With Covid-19 unleashing unprecedented disease and death in the state, there are many people across the state who are left grappling with the sudden loss of their near and dear ones. Dr Kevin Patel, a psychiatrist with hospital for mental health, said that in a recent case an 18-year-old girl would call up a private hospital frequently to get updates on her father’s health. “The father died over a month ago and the daughter was part of all post-death rituals. But somehow she has not been able to completely accept the loss and remains in denial. In fact, she told us she has recurrent vision that the father is very much around,” said Dr Patel. “After a sustained treatment, one day she cried like over 10 minutes – the first time after her father’s death – and accepted her loss.” What makes the Covid-19 deaths different? Dr Nehal Shah, a city-based psychiatrist, said that these are ‘unnatural deaths.’ “Unlike other scenarios, the family members don't get to take the dead home, perform the last rituals before the cremation or burial, and don’t even have the support system around to help them come to terms with the death. Thus, for many, it seems unreal,” he said. Narrating a similar instance, Dr Shah said that a retired bank employee recently lost his wife in the pandemic. “But he would carry on with his life like nothing had happened insisting his wife had gone to her brother’s residence and would come back soon. He would fold her clothes, try to contact her and also make plans of what they would do upon her return,” he said. “Initially, his son felt he would come to terms, but when he continued with the routine for over a fortnight, they got worried and sought psychiatric intervention," said Dr Shah. Dr Patel said that it may take a few days to a few weeks for the patients to recover with support of the family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/woman-phones-dead-son-from-outside-covid-hosp/articleshow/82151066.cms||Yogesh Chawda

City-based dermatologist Dr Madhvi said a few most common home ingredients for good skin are aloe vera, turmeric, fruit pack, shea butter, coconut oil and rosewater among others. When asked about face masks, she said surgical mask is the best for safety and maintenance of skin. “Compact masks lower the oxygen concentration in facial skin, which can lead to open pore, acne and peeling skin,” she said. Few other beauty and skincare experts claimed that people should increase the intake of fluids, including water, which keep the skin hydrated, especially amid the soaring temperature. Citrus fruits and vegetables or hydrating smoothie by combining fresh frozen fruits blended with milk are rich in vitamins and also boost immunity. Some skincare experts also suggested that detox water is good for a clear skin as it enhances the body functioning, especially in the summer. Lemon, cucumber and mint, strawberry, kiwi, watermelon, apple cider, aloe vera, honey and watermelon are a few ingredients for making detox water. Soumya Shah, skincare expert, said: “Honey and coconut are suggested solutions to treat dull, lifeless or wrinkled skin as they effectively brighten complexion, hydrate and add a healthy glow to the skin.” She added: “Natural moisturising scrub, using a combination of sugar, honey, olive or coconut oil, is good for the skin. Applying coconut oil before bedtime or anytime can give benefits against chapped or cracked skin areas.” Residents are also resorting to more and more home remedies for skincare. Priyanka Agarwal of Rajendra Nagar said: “I follow skincare routine regularly and have made a few changes in daily lifestyle, which have resulted in gradual healthy skin.” However, experts also caution residents to avoid too much makeup products, otherwise it can lead to clogging of pores and breakouts. “With the increase in cases of Covid-19, I have taken my beauty routine in my own hands and started treating my skin with home remedies that consist of natural ingredients,” said Shambhavi Singh, a resident of Digha Road area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/experts-advise-home-remedies-for-skincare-during-pandemic/articleshow/82149784.cms||---

The accused, a relative of the deceased, had allegedly lured the minor to his house over some pretext and after raping her, strangled her to death. After killing the girl, the accused hid her body in the fodder dump in his house. The minor’s body, with serious strangulation marks, was found from a fodder dump in his house on late Sunday night. A complaint filed by her family stated that she had gone outside to play with other children when she went missing. During initial investigation, the victim's parents told the police that on Sunday evening, their daughter had left the house to play with other children in the vicinity. "It was when she didn't return for long, they inquired about her whereabouts from neighbours, but in vain," police said and added,"During further investigation, it came to notice that the girl was last seen near her relative’s house in the locality." Following which, the girl's parents and villagers conducted a search at her relative’s house, police further said. "During search, they found the girl's body hidden in a fodder dump. Subsequently, they brutally assaulted the girl's relative. Someone from the crowd, meanwhile, alerted the police control room. A police team from Marka police station rushed to the spot and took the accused into its custody.

I urge the Maharashtra CM not to single out states as ‘places of sensitive origin’ andwithdraw the said order in public interest.” Health minister Vishwajit Rane reacted sharply to Maharashtra’s decision. “I think Uddhav Thackeray has some allergy to Goa,” he said. On Sunday night, Maharashtra issued an order declaring six states — Goa, Kerala, Rajasthan, Gurarat, Delhi/NCR and Uttarakhand — as place of sensitive origin “in order to curb the transmission of the Covid-19 virus in the state and in order to stop the influx of other virus variants into the state of Maharashtra”. The order requires travellers from the six states to produce a Covid-19 negative certificate of a test done 48 hours prior to arrival in Maharashtra. After a traveller from a sensitive place enters Maharashtra, they will be screened. Passengers with negative RT-PCR tests will undergo minimal checking like thermal scanning and symptom check. Sources told TOI that this may impact the tourism industry, as a lot of people from Maharashtra visit Goa. Sawant, meanwhile, said that due to the rise in cases, there’s already a decline in tourism. “Only those people who have business or some urgent work are travelling to the state,” Sawant said. Over the past few months, a fourth of Goa’s total domestic tourist inflow has been from Maharashtra, especially on weekends and extended weekends. During the pandemic, the number of people travelling to Goa for longer stays has also multiplied.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-cries-foul-after-maha-brands-state-sensitive/articleshow/82152673.cms||---
---||Business||NBFC buoyed mistakenly by rising demand for oxygen||MUMBAI: The country’s gasp for oxygen in its fight against Covid and investors’ rush to cash in on companies manufacturing the gas have pumped up the stock of a little-known non-banking financial company (NBFC) in a case of mistaken identity. The stock of Bombay Oxygen Investments — which has nothing to do with medical oxygen production any more — has been rallying and saw a record close on Monday. The share ended at Rs 24,575 on the BSE, up 189% from the 52-week low of Rs 8,512. The rally in the stock started less than a month ago on March 25 when it was trading at Rs 10,000. Coronavirus: Live updatesThe significant share price movement had prompted the stock exchange to seek a clarification from the company. In its reply, Bombay Oxygen said that its share price movement was market driven and the company was in no way connected to it. Bombay Oxygen was incorporated in October 1960 and the word ‘Investments’ was added in October 2018. Subsequently in August 2019, it discontinued its earlier business of manufacturing and supplying industrial gases. In December 2019, it received an RBI nod to continue as an NBFC, the company said on its website. The city-based company owns substantial investments in the form of shares, mutual funds and other financial securities, and “the income from such financial investments is the source of its revenue”, it added. “It’s (the stock) got pumped up as an oxygen manufacturing company dealing in industrial gases on social media,” tweeted Amit Kumar Gupta, a financial adviser. “In these times, anything in the name of oxygen can do wonders. Stock price is too high to attract retail investors,” was the response from one Bharat Chandak to Gupta’s tweet.For the nine months of fiscal 2021, Bombay Oxygen made a profit of Rs 109 crore on an income of Rs 50 crore. In the same period of fiscal 2020, it made a profit of Rs 59 lakh on an income of Rs 6 crore. The shortage of oxygen for medical usage due to the ongoing healthcare crisis — with a large part of it being supplied by industrial users — is leading to strong buying in shares of the producers of this gas: National Oxygen, Linde India, Bhagawati Oxygen, Gagan Gas and some others. The biggest producer, Inox Air Products, however, is not listed. Even stocks of cylinder manufacturers like Everest Kanto Cylinders are witnessing strong buying. In the last one month, National Oxygen has gained 42% to Rs 62 now, while Linde India is up a little over 9% to Rs 1,896 and Everest Kanto has gained nearly 22% to Rs 92.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nbfc-buoyed-mistakenly-by-rising-demand-for-o2/articleshow/82151546.cms||Partha Sinha

He was the third council employee who died of Covid-19 in the last 10 days,” the Council public relations officer Ajit Ranjan told TOI on Monday. After a brief condolence meeting, the chairman ordered the closure to check the spread of the infection among other employees. Two other council employees Vijendra Kumar Sharma and Arun Ram (both working as an assistant) died of Covid-19 on April 13 and April 10, respectively. After Arun’s untimely death, the council arranged a rapid antigen test of all its employees on April 13. Of around 75 employees who went for the test at the council premises, 18 were found positive for Covid-19. The death of three employees in the past 10 days has sent a shock wave among all the council employees as the majority of them came in close contact with either of three deceased colleagues due to one or the other reasons. Several employees have gone into isolation at their home.

---||Business||Health worker cover may get renewed soon||MUMBAI: New India Assurance is likely to renew the insurance scheme for health workers fighting Covid, which came into effect from March 30, 2020, as part of the PM Garib Kalyan Package. The policy was a short-term cover valid for 90 days, but was subsequently extended up to March 24, 2021. It provided a life cover of Rs 50 lakh for those health workers fighting Covid. While the claims under the policy have been much higher than the premium, the government has capped New India Assurance’s liability — under the policy so losses would be borne by the government. Coronavirus: Live updatesThe cover is intended to play the role of a social security scheme for health workers. The policy is a unique cover as it was issued on the back of government support without any data on what the claims were expected to be. Although it covers life, it is issued by a general insurance company as a personal accident policy covering only a single risk — death arising out of accidentally contracting Covid. Sources said the new policy may have the same terms as the expiring policy as the process of identifying those who are covered and claim settlement has got streamlined. While there have been calls for extending the coverage beyond the government definition of healthcare workers, industry sources said that the policy would be difficult to implement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/health-worker-cover-may-get-renewed-soon/articleshow/82151529.cms||---

A few pharmacies, it was alleged, are hoarding the injection and selling it at an inflated price of Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000. The antiviral prescription drug is mostly used for moderately severe hospitalised Covid-19 cases and a patient usually requires six vials. Stocks, however, are available with government hospitals, including Chest Hospital and King George Hospital (KGH), and administered free of cost. On Monday, an elderly couple aged between 65 and 70, undergoing Covid-19 treatment at a private hospital near Zilla Parishad junction, required Remdesivir shots. But their family members could not find the injection until evening despite enquiries at several pharmacies around the area. A medico from AMC said, “I came to know that Remdesivir stock is inadequate at many private hospitals and pharmacies though we have it here at KGH and Chest Hospital. Outside, depending on the brand, each vial is supposed to be priced between Rs 4,000 to Rs 5,000 but my acquaintances told me that it is illegally being sold at exorbitant prices like Rs 15,000 or Rs 20,000 at some smaller drug stores.” State president of Indian Medical Association Dr N Subrahmanyam said, “We are hearing complaints from the public about the shortage of Remdesivir injections and sales at highly inflated prices. In our Covid-19 advisory, we have asked the government to ensure prevention of illegal hoarding of Remdesivir. The government should also make this antiviral drug available by enhancing production capacities and streamlining distribution to both private and government hospitals and pharmacies.” According to doctors, while Remdesivir injections cannot prevent death, they can reduce hospital stay and severity of infection. “It is recommended only for moderate to severe in-patients but not for mild cases in home quarantine. It should not be used for a prolonged period but for six days or as prescribed by treating doctors. So patients should also use it judiciously,” added Dr Subrahmanyam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/remdesivir-in-short-supply-worry-patients/articleshow/82149717.cms||Sulogna Mehta

Such commercial establishments have been ordered to remain closed till May 15 in a bid to break the chain of rapidly spiking Covid-19 cases in the state. Navnit Kumar, the manager of a multiplex at Pataliputra, said, "Despite scattered revenue and business losses, we are satisfied with the actions taken by the state government. Government’s efforts in battling Covid-19 crisis are needed as our state continues to witness fresh curbs." Though the eateries have been allowed to run home delivery and take away services till 9 pm, following which night curfew will be in place till 5 am, people running such commercial units rued financial setback due to the fresh curbs. Arun Kumar, a manager at a mall at Fraser Road, said, "Covid-19 pandemic has hit us very badly. The eateries remain closed for two and a half months during the nationwide lockdown last year. The second wave of the pandemic and the fresh restrictions will once again reduce our profits. However, the situation is so bad that saving lives is more important than anything else." Astik Sharma, the owner of a cafe at Lohia Nagar, said the dining industry depends on footfall and home-delivery will not support much. "We were already witnessing reduced footfall over the past fortnight following the second wave of the pandemic. Our sales are down but payments of rent and staff salaries continue to mount. Survival of any restaurant business in this challenging scenario is difficult," he said. Vaibhav Raj, director of a dining outlet at Kankarbagh, echoed similar views. "The food and dining sector consists of ambience, services and presentation. Online or home delivery services would not be enough to compensate for the losses. We will not be able to sustain in this business for long as online orders are less and that too have some commission charges, which is to be paid by the owners," he said. Shianjany Pradhan, 20, an undergraduate student told this newspaper that being responsible citizens, people should also realise their responsibilities and support the curbs. "I feel it's the right decision taken by our government on the closure of the malls, cinema halls and other public places to break the Covid chain," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/owners-fear-the-worse-as-malls-eateries-down-shutters/articleshow/82149723.cms||---

The call, which came into effect on April 18, will be in place till April 30. A majority of shops, however, stayed open on Sunday even as areas such as Kaleswara Rao Market saw many shops shut during the day. The call, however, saw families and retailers rushing to the market on Monday morning, fearing the sudden announcement of a curfew or other restrictions. At meat markets, social distancing norms went for a toss. Some small-time shopowners who kept their businesses open said their earnings are similar in nature to a daily wagers, while others said they weren’t aware of any call. Businesses on Besant Road were crowded as usual, particularly at small stalls and electronics shops. “We are following Covid-19 norms and aren’t welcoming customers who aren’t wearing proper masks. My business is still haunted by last year’s lockdown, and I still have mortgages to pay and pending wages for my employees still remain,” said Manoj Kumar, who runs a laptop service centre at NTR Complex. Though the VCCI had given representations to the city police commissioner and the Krishna district police to officially impose curbs, cops continued with their drive on imposing fines against mask violations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/industrys-call-for-business-curbs-gets-mixed-response-from-traders/articleshow/82149732.cms||---

The bank’s recent statement was in response to media reports based on an IIT-Bombay report by Professor Ashish Das highlighting the step-motherly treatment by banks in general to Basic Savings Bank Deposit accounts of which large number are the Jan Dhan Yojana accounts. These are in the nature of universal bank accounts, which do not attract charges and have no minimum balance requirement. Responding to SBI’s clarification, Das has issued a ‘statement of facts’, where he has pointed out that RBI’s August 12 circular merely states that a maximum of four free withdrawals can be allowed. It also states that banks can evolve value-added services beyond the stipulated minimum services for which they can apply charges that are reasonable and transparent and apply them in a non-discriminatory manner. Moreover, Das pointed out, in September 2013, the RBI in its frequently-asked-questions section had clarified that “BSBDA holders are allowed more than four withdrawals in a month, at the bank’s discretion, provided the bank does not charge for the same”. SBI in its clarification indicated that all the refunds it was supposed to have undertaken have already been done. This followed a directive by the central board of direct taxes in August 2020, where it advised banks to refund charges collected after January 1, 2020, on transactions carried out using the digital mode. It also asked banks not to impose charges on future digital transactions. “In terms of CBDT directives, SBI has refunded the charges recovered in respect of all the digital transactions to the BSBD customers from January 1, 2020 to September 14, 2020. SBI has stopped recovering charges in such accounts on all digital transactions from September 15, 2020, while retaining charges on cash withdrawals over and above four free withdrawals allowed per month,” the bank said. However, Das said that there still exists a breach of regulations because according to the September 2013 circular or the July 2015 master circular of RBI, the bank cannot impose service charges on a running BSBDA. “It had been with respect to this technicality that the question arose of how Rs 300 crore got collected during the five-year period 2015-20, in breach of regulations,” Das said. Das again questioned SBI’s ‘reasonableness in fixing a charge of Rs 17.7 for every digital transaction during that period. “Such reasonableness of charges was to be ensured by the bank’s board of directors based on the regulatory principles as mandated by the RBI. The charge of Rs 17.7 for an unassisted digital debit transaction is neither reasonable nor just,” said Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sbi-says-charges-on-zero-balance-accounts-prior-to-2020-were-reasonable/articleshow/82151874.cms||Mayur Shetty

The committee of creditors representing the lenders had approved a hybrid plan where Prestige will pay upfront cash of Rs 370 crore and provide the lenders with 8 lakh square feet built-up commercial area. This has led to the resolution of Rs 1,650 crore of debt of the approximately Rs 2,200 crore owed by Ariisto Developers. This is one of the largest real estate resolutions in Maharashtra in recent times. The project was stuck for over a decade due to legislation. The property was planned on a 30-acre hill-facing plot in Mulund. This will be Prestige’s first major project in Mumbai. Legal firm Rajani Associates acted as adviser to the corporate insolvency resolution professional of Ariisto Developers. Speaking to TOI, Ashish Parwani, partner at Rajani Associates, said that the National Company Law Tribunal has approved the transaction. “This is a win-win resolution for the buyers and the lenders as the project was stuck for more than 12 years,” said Parwani. Prestige has agreed to complete the project and has also promised to deliver the commercial premises to the lenders in four years. Parwani said that the lenders would be free to sell the commercial property to anyone. There are 104 financial creditors admitted under the insolvency process. Some of the big names in the list are HDFC, IIFL Trustee, Indiabulls Housing Finance and JM Financial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bengalurus-prestige-acquires-stuck-housing-project-in-mulund/articleshow/82151809.cms||Mayur Shetty

He asked the officials to identify the water-chronic areas in advance and plan the ways to minimise waterlogging in such localities during heavy rainfall. Agarwal, after a meeting to review the status of desiltation of drains with municipal commissioner Himanshu Sharma and other officers, said the cleaning operation was affected due to illegal constructions on both sides of the drains. He asked the civic body to remove the encroachments from big drains. “All the drainage cleaning works should be completed by May 15 while the nine big drains need to be cleaned by April-end. The civic bod needs to form a team and visit all the small drains and ascertain the reason of their blockage. Apart from cleaning of drains, the sump houses and motors that pumped out water from different areas during the rainy season need to be fixed to ensure that there will be no obstruction,” he said and added: “Amid the pandemic, the sanitation workers will be provided with safety gear-masks, gloves and sanitisers and work on roster basis.” The PMC has already started desilting of drains from April 1. It has engaged more than 2,000 sanitation workers for the work. It has pressed machineries like JCBs, bobcat, Poclain Hydraulics, super suction machines, tipper silt, skid-steer loader, haiwas and tractors for the removal of garbage from the drains. For the cleaning of small drains and manholes, robotic scavenging machine has been pressed into use to unclog the sewers. Himanshu said around 50% of the work on big drains and 40% on small drains had been completed. “We will achieve the target of unclogging all the drains by mid-May,” he added. There are nine big, 14 medium and 172 small drains besides 40,373 manholes and 35656 catch-pits in the Patna municipal area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/civic-body-asked-to-clean-all-drains-by-may-15/articleshow/82149906.cms||Faryal Rumi

Ansari also tried to seek help of officials, party leaders and office-bearers but in vain. Ansari informed reporters on Monday that his sister-in-law died due to Covid on April 17 as could not get a bed in any Covid facility for her treatment. “I contacted the district magistrate, leaders and senior office-bearers of the party but failed to arrange a bed in any Covid facility,” said Ansari. “It was a shocking experience. Even party office-bearers like us are unable to get required treatment for our family members,” said Ansari, adding that it is heart wrenching to see people losing battle against Covid due to lack of hospital beds, oxygen and medicines. “I request the PM and chief minister Yogi Adityanath to initiate all necessary measures to ensure there is no shortage of hospital beds, oxygen and medicines. People should not lose their family members like we did,” said Ansari. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi interacted with people on July 9, 2020 to know how they were working together to ensure that nobody is going to bed hungry during Covid-19 crisis, Ansari had shared his views with him.

Although stocks across sectors witnessed strong selling and closed in the red, pharma and IT ended with gains. Of the 30 sensex stocks, only two — Dr Reddy’s and Infosys — closed higher. BSE data also showed that HDFC, RIL and Kotak Bank accounted for most of the index’s loss. On the NSE, the Nifty closed 258 points lower at 14,359 points. Both sensex and Nifty closed at their two-and-half month low levels as foreign funds continued selling in the domestic market. The day’s slide in the market also left investors poorer by Rs 3.5 lakh crore with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 203.8 lakh crore. According to Axis Securities chief investment officer Naveen Kulkarni, the market seems to be concerned about the imposition of a second nationwide lockdown. “Market volatility has come back as the Centre and state governments are considering additional restrictions due to the increasing infection rate and to curb the spread of Covid across the country.” Monday’s 1.8% slide in the sensex came on the back of a Rs 1,634-crore net selling by foreign funds. Exchange data also showed that even a Rs 2,356-crore net fund infusion by domestic funds was not enough to cushion the sharp fall. The day’s net selling by foreign institutional investors also took the month’s net outflow figure closer to the $1-billion mark, at Rs 7,021 crore, official data showed. The unabated selling by foreign investors is also making traders in the forex market nervous. As a result, in volatile trades, the rupee closed 52 paise weaker at 74.88 to a dollar. Fresh lockdown measures weighed on market sentiment here too, traders said. However, given that the current weakness is mainly because of the rising Covid cases, there is high chance this is a temporary phenomenon. According to Kotak Mahindra Bank whole time director K V S Manian, the forex markets and dealers seem relatively more spooked by the surge in Covid cases and hence this weakness may be purely sentiment-driven, unless there have been some large flows impacting the rupee. “The fundamentals of the economy — both Indian and international — have not changed or are not yet expected to change significantly for the rupee to weaken so much. The bond and equity markets are still not showing similar levels of weakness,” Manian said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-tanks-883-pts-to-over-2-mth-low-on-lockdown-fears-rupee-nears-75/articleshow/82151525.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Man, aided by his mother, tortures wife in East Godavari; both arrested||Rajahmundry: A man has been arrested for allegedly torturing his wife at Chatti village of Chinturu mandal in East Godavari district. According to the police, the accused allegedly forced his wife to dip her hands in boiling water, sprayed chilli powder in her private parts and even attempted to set her on fire. The accused has been identified as Kalyanam Venkanna. Police said Venkanna married Kalyanam Jayamma, a native of Karrajulagutta of Bhadrachalam in Telangana, around 10 years ago. This was the accused’s second marriage. Venkanna was married earlier and had three children with his first wife but kept it a secret from Jayamma. Over the last two years, Venkanna grew addicted to alcohol and began harassing his wife both physically and psychologically allegedly aided by his mother Maremma. On April 3, Venkanna boiled oil and allegedly forced his wife to dip her hands in it. The next morning, Jayamma went to her parents’ house in Bhadrachalem. Jayamma’s parents questioned her husband about the incident over the phone. Venkanna reportedly expressed contrition and assured them he would not repeat such behaviour. He went to Bhadrachalem and brought his wife back home. But after reaching home, Venkanna took Jayamma to a nearby forest, poured petrol on her and attempted to set her on fire. Jayamma sustained burn injuries to her waist. Then, Venkanna brought Jayamma back home and put chilli powder in her private parts. Jayamma rushed back to her parents’ home in Bhadrachalem. Venkanna once again visited his in-laws’ home, this time accompanied by his mother, who allegedly threatened to kill Jayamma. Jayamma and her parents approached Bhadrachalem police who advised them to lodge a complaint with Chinturu police station. Chinturu police registered a case and sent Jayamma to Chinturu government hospital for treatment. Meanwhile, the accused allegedly sent videos of him torturing his wife to another person. Cops called his first wife Kalyanam Sunita and took her statement. Venkanna and his mother Maremma have been arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/man-aided-by-his-mother-tortures-wife-in-east-godavari-both-arrested/articleshow/82149810.cms||Samson Raj

The other members are ICICI Bank ED Vishaka Mulye, SBI deputy MD R N Prasad, EY partner Abizer Diwanji, MDI economics professor Rohit Prasad and CA R Anand. The panel will submit their report within three months of their first meeting. ARCs are entities that purchase bad loans from banks and salvage value from them by finding buyers for the security or selling the business. In February, the government had said that public sector banks will set up a national ARC which will buy bad loans from banks and help clean their books. Banks had decided to set up their ARC as the valuation of assets turned out to be a roadblock in selling them to existing ARCs. The terms of reference of the panel include a review of the existing legal and regulatory framework applicable to ARCs and to recommend measures to improve the efficacy of ARCs. The panel will also review the role of ARC in the resolution of stressed assets including under the bankruptcy law. They will also review the business model of ARCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-sets-up-panel-to-review-arcs/articleshow/82151693.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Patna||Bihar: Fitness trainers, gym owners rue closure||PATNA: As the state government ordered closure of gyms and fitness centres along with parks, zoo and cinema halls after the spike in Covid cases, the owners of many such facilities said they will have to bear the brunt, financially. Saurabh Raj, the owner and trainer of a gym in Kankarbagh, said, “Our business can no longer take the financial strain as we have been already struggling for over a year. The government should have been considerate towards people like us.” Aviral Kumar, the fitness coach at a gym on Boring Road echoed the same. “The restrictions on timing was a win-win situation for everyone, but complete closure is unfair to us,” he said. Shushank Tiwari, manager of a fitness centre at Patliputra Colony, said they are not taking new membership as of now. “With the prevailing scenario, we don’t know when the facility will resume. We don’t want to waste people’s money as everyone is going through financial stress,” he said. Sportspersons and athletes are also frustrated with the restrictions imposed. “Performance-driven training for athletes is different and requires special equipment and training, which is impossible at home. Closure of sports complexes will badly affect sportsmen,” said Abhishek Kumar, a former athletics coach. Ravi Shankar Singh, a resident of Jagdeo Path, said he used to visit the zoo for his daily morning walk. “Zoo is the safest and cleanest place for walk. it’s also so big that people hardly come across each other. Now I have to remain confined at home,” he said. Patna zoo director Satyajeet Kumar said there was low footfall even before the closure. “Since the beginning of the month, the footfall was declining with each passing day. People were conscious and avoiding public places,” he said. Stating that closure of Valmiki Tiger Reserve (VTR) won’t affect ecotourism, a senior official posted there said: “The peak tourist season is already behind us and the footfall is minimal during this period due to heatwave. So the temporary closure won’t affect its revenue.” Shashikant Kumar, district forest officer (parks), Patna, said the maintenance work in all the important parks of the city will continue with Covid protocols in place. “Maintenance work will continue as plants need continuous conditioning,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/fitness-trainers-gym-owners-rue-closure/articleshow/82149701.cms||---

The flat, on the terrace of four-storey Sushila Anand Apartment on Arya Samaj Mandir Road, was locked from outside, as the wife of flat owner Baban Sharma had gone for a morning walk and their daughter and grandson were sleeping inside. Baban belongs to Pandarak in Patna district. CM Nitish Kumar, in a statement, said he was deeply pained as Baban had been associated with him since 1989. Danapur police station SHO Ajeet Kumar Saha said the deceased were identified as Priyanka Kumari, 35, and her son Yagya Kumar, 12. He said the locals told police that Priyanka’s husband Rakesh Kumar is an engineer and works in a private firm in Chhatisgarh. “Short-circuit might have caused the fire. Further investigation will clear the things,” he said. Danapur fire station officer Indrajeet Kumar said Priyanka had come to live with her parents just for a few days. He said Priyanka’s elderly mother had left for a morning walk after locking the flat from outside. “Neighbours spotted the fire around 6am. The fire control room was informed at 6.20am. By 6.23am, a mist technology fire tender had reached the spot,” he said. “The neighbours initially tried to break the locks, but in vain,” Kumar said. He said the neighbours told them that they initially had heard screams of Priyanka and Yagya for rescue. “By the time we reached the spot, there was no response from outside. At least two locks were broken to gain entry inside the burning flat and pull out the duo,” he said. The officer said they had their pulse running at that time. “They were rushed to a private hospital at Saguna Mor but doctors declared them dead,” he said. He said the entire flat was renovated hardly six months back. “Extensive plywood work was done inside the flat. The windows were sealed using plyboard, perhaps for installing airconditioners. There was a space for a terrace roof but it was also packed using asbestos,” he said. Kumar said the smoke in locked flat with ventilation points sealed resulted asphyxiated them. He said their bodies didn’t have any burn injuries. “Two cylinders inside the flat also exploded and damaged the walls. The exact location where fire broke out could not be known as everything was badly charred. Neighbours told that more than Rs 1 crore was spent on renovation,” he said. The officer said 10 big fire tenders, one hydraulic platform and four mist technology tenders were pressed into service. “It took almost four hours to completely douse the flames. Sealed windows prevented water from going inside,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/woman-son-asphyxiated-as-flat-catches-fire-in-city/articleshow/82150042.cms||---

Referring to the unprecedented surge in Covid19 cases, Tejashwi said the Centre did precious little in the past year to improve health infrastructure in government-run hospitals. "Since cases have gained alarming proportions, the central government is now shirking its responsibility and blaming the state governments for lack of facilities," he added. The RJD leader sought to know about the PMCares fund and the Arogya App. He also criticized the Centre for the slow pace of vaccination to check the spread of Covid19. Tejashwi took to Twitter to expose the poor health infrastructure in the state hospitals. Taking a swipe at CM Nitish Kumar, the RJD leader said the state government even failed to ensure the supply of oxygen in the hospitals. He alleged that the state health department is virtually in ICU as people have been left at the mercy of the Almighty. "Even in 16 years, Nitish could not deliver the desired results on the health front," he added. Terming the claims of CM as hollow, Tejashwi said, "Many people would not have lost their lives, had the government taken initiatives on time and improved facilities in the hospitals after the first wave." Tejashwi said it would not be prudent to say the resurgence of the virus was sudden, it was known that a second wave would come and there was one year to prepare for it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejas-attacks-centre-for-putting-blame-on-states-for-poor-health-infra/articleshow/82149952.cms||Ramashankar

BPA state president Mrityunjay Kumar Singh shot off a missive to the DGP on Monday requesting him to make special arrangements for treatment of corona frontline workers and their families. “Police personnel and their family members were running from pillar to post for treatment but no beds are available in the hospitals,”the BPA functionary lamented. In his letter, the association leader said that while a sub-inspector Triloki Nath Rai and inspector Jaidev Bhagat died on Sunday, Kiul GRP inspector Raj Kishore Sinha succumbed to the deadly virus on Monday. According to the letter addressed to the state police chief, Rai was posted in East Champaran district while Bhagat was serving with the special branch at the police headquarters. The association leader said that another inspector Brajesh Kumar and his family members were in critical condition and required immediate medical assistant. Kumar’s family resided at AG Colony in the state capital. "It will be of great help if some beds were made available for the police personnel and their families at the headquarters level," he added. He also urged the DGP to deploy a police officer with a dedicated mobile number at the headquarters to coordinate with the affected family members of the police personnel. According to a rough estimate, over 100 police personnel, including half-a-dozen station house officers (SHOs), have tested positive during resurgence of Covid-19 in the state. Patna, Gaya, Bhagalpur, Katihar and Nawada districts have been identified as worst hit. A senior police officer posted at the police headquarters said that the issue would be taken up on a priority level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bpa-seeks-dgps-intervention-for-treatment-of-covid-19-infected-cops/articleshow/82149927.cms||Ramashankar

With the government asking district collectors to take a decision based on local conditions, district administrations are moving towards enforcement of partial lockdown. Municipal officials in Mangalagiri town in Guntur district directed traders to operate between 6 am to 11 am from Tuesday. Merchants have agreed to operate for limited hours to contain the virus spread. Mangalagiri constituency witnessed 152 Covid-19 positive cases on Sunday with 70 cases reported from Mangalagiri town and 65 in Tadepalle town. Another 17 cases were reported from neighbouring Duggirala mandal. With Mangalagiri region reporting 146 cases on Saturday, Sunday’s tally added to the case load in the area by nearly 300 in just 48 hours. Municipal authorities have also issued instructions to close down malls, function halls and theatres. Darshan for pilgrims at Panakala Sri Lakshminarasimha Swamy in Mangalagiri town had also been suspended for a fortnight. With the chief minister’s camp office located in Mangalagiri corporation limits, the local administration has opted to enforce restrictions on movement of public in markets and public places. Local legislator Alla Ramakrishna Reddy reviewed the situation with officials and directed them to impose Section 144 of the CrPC to restrict public gatherings. He also asked officials to ready a dedicated Covid-19 care centre in the town and suggested police restrict more than three people in autorickshaws. “Many autos are carrying more than 10 people leaving little space to breath. One positive patient is enough to make others fall sick,” said Ramakrishna Reddy. Meanwhile, district collector Vivek Yadav appointed tehsildars and municipal commissioners as incident commanders under the Disaster Management Act. “Ensure that Covid-19 protocols are followed in religious institutions, hotels, restaurants and business outlets,” said Yadav, adding that officials issue notices to and take action against those who violate guidelines. Yadav said a dedicated toll-free call centre (104) was set up in the district for Covid-19 patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/in-mangalagiri-business-not-as-usual-amid-surge-in-infections/articleshow/82158811.cms||Samdani MN

Sanjeev Nagarkoti, a passenger who was travelling in a state transport bus, said, “I thought the checking would be mandatory everywhere and I also took every preventive measure while travelling. But, most passengers went away after reaching the destination and only some gave their samples for an antigen test.” Similarly at the airport, people arriving from other states are being checked by police personnel who are first verifying their travel source following which the health department teams are collecting their samples. However, people coming from within the state were allowed to move out without any checks. ADM, Protocol, GC Gunwant meanwhile said that samples of people reaching the state borders are being taken, while arrangements have also been made for conducting RT-PCR tests.

This has increased the worries of vendors who were already struggling to earn their livelihood due to Covid-related restrictions. “On Friday, Delhi government issued orders for allowing one market per zone. But after the recent lockdown order, the previous order stands cancelled. We are also in favour of lockdown, but worried about earning our livelihood and hope this situation won’t last long,” said Rajkumar Kataria, general secretary of weekly vendors market association in south Delhi. The vendors also fear that their markets may be closed for a longer time as last year the government didn’t give permission for full-fledged operation of these markets till October-end. In comparison, other markets resumed operations from June, with certain restrictions. Rajesh Gupta of north Delhi weekly market association said, “We support the government’s decision and want Covid-19 cases to come down. But this is our season when we can do good business during the upcoming Eid festival. We expect the government to allow our operation with restrictions after the lockdown, including restricting space allowed to vendors and ensuring social distancing.” Expressing concern over the condition of street vendors in the city, the New Association of Street Vendor of India (NASVI) wrote a letter to the chief minister on Monday, asking for “protection” of their livelihood. “We want the government to make serious efforts — such as food vendors should also be included in essential service like vegetable and fruit sellers and Rs 6,000 should be provided to all surveyed dwellers per month, till their livelihood is restored,” said Arbind Singh, national coordinator, NASVI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vendors-worries-mount-as-weekly-mkts-to-close-for-6-day-lockdown/articleshow/82151747.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Goa||Goa flights cancelled as states impose curbs||PANAJI: With Delhi, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and several other states imposing lockdowns and night curfews, airlines have begun to feel the impact. According to the Airports Authority of India (AAI), 33 flights to Goa were cancelled on Sunday and at last count, 38 were cancelled on Monday. The restrictions imposed by several states has prompted many travellers, particularly families, to cancel their travel. Goa airport director Gagan Malik expects airlines to cut down the number of flights from metros to Goa in the coming days. “On Sunday, 33 flights to the state were cancelled and the passenger inflow was 3,000 instead of 11,000 passengers that we receive on a weekend. On weekdays, at least 9,000 passengers arrive in Goa each day,” said Malik. Delhi has announced a week-long lockdown to rein in Covid-19 cases there. Maharashtra has also imposed restrictions on movement. Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu are among the other states that have imposed curbs on movement. According to the Union health ministry Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Rajasthan are among the 10 states that account for 78.6% of the new Covid-19 cases. The other states in the list are Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. “The situation is grim. Though the cancellations started three to four days ago, the numbers shot up on Sunday. We expect airlines to reduce their flights. Airlines will consolidate flights even though passengers may stay around 3,000,” said Malik. Sources in the airline industry said that most of the flights to Goa were from metros where the number of Covid-19 cases have surged. Even though the government has not put any restrictions on flights, many such fliers were hesitant to take flights at night in places where night curfews have been imposed. The reduction in arrivals may provide the state government with some breathing space as it was under tremendous pressure to restrict the entry of tourists. “With so many states imposing curfews and flights being cancelled, there is nothing left for Goa to do,” said a government officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-flights-cancelled-as-states-impose-curbs/articleshow/82152676.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Mumbai||Banking frauds make for 50% of phishing cases in Maharashtra||MUMBAI: Half of all phishing complaints reported to the state's nodal cybersecurity agency, Maharashtra Cyber, in the past two financial years pertained to banking frauds. Data with the agency's Anti Phishing Unit received 5226 complaints between April 2019 and March 2021. A phishing attack involves sending fraudulent communication like texts or emails that appear to have come from a reputable source. The goal is to steal sensitive data or to install malware. "As people were grounded and spent a large part of 2020 in front of the screen, cyberscamsters became more active," said a senior official with Maharashtra Cyber. But lawyers believe that the actual number of phishing attacks occurring in the state are far more than those being reported to Maharashtra Cyber's portal. "The agency's portal (reportphishing.in) has not been publicized enough," says cyber lawyer Prashant Mali. "The Anti Phishing Unit should also make data available on how many complaints received by them eventually convert into FIRs. For a victim of cyber crime, what matters the most is getting his money back and the process of law cannot begin without registration of an FIR," he added. A few lawyers have been utilizing a provision in the Information Technology (IT) Act to seek monetary relief for their clients. The IT Act gives powers to an adjudicating authority (principal IT secretary for Maharashtra) to hold an enquiry and adjudicate matters where claims do not exceed Rs 5 crore. "A civil complaint can be filed and compensation sought where corporates have failed to protect sensitive personal data (such as a bank in case of a banking fraud or a telecom company in case of a Sim swap fraud)," Mali said. Cybercrimes in India had caused a financial loss of Rs 1.25 lakh crore in 2019. "Most malware attacks in India begin through phishing," says Sivarama Krishnan, partner and leader, cyber security, PwC India. Organisations are doing their bit to tackle phishing by installing filters that throw out phishing emails before they reach employees. Some are training employees on the do's and dont's. "The golden rule is to not click on dubious links nor share passwords/ OTPs," says lawyer Vicky Shah. "The government also needs to make stringent norms for the issue of duplicate Sim cards," he added. Sim swap frauds could also begin with a phishing attack. A phishing email is first sent to get the user's banking details. To use these details, the fraudster clones the user's mobile Sim card to get access to his texts. At present, any street side vendor offers to sell Sim cards. Among other complaints reported to the Anti Phishing Unit, about 7% involved users losing money in the lure of winning lotteries, 5% complaints pertained to employment scams where users keyed in details on fake job portals, 3% were investment related scams and 2% frauds mentioned government schemes. The Anti Phishing Unit coordinates with nodals of cyber police stations across India and overseas to help resolve or report such cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/banking-frauds-make-for-50-of-phishing-cases-in-maharashtra-state/articleshow/82152756.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Lucknow||BJP govt unable to control pandemic, should quit: Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Holding the BJP government responsible for the pathetic handling of Covid-19 situation, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Monday said if the ruling party is unable to handle the situation, the party should step down from power. Lambasting Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for addressing election rallies as ‘star campaigner’ in other states and leaving his Team-11 in hibernation instead of focussing on arrangements to counter the second wave of Covid-19, Akhilesh said the government of the day is accountable for the misery of people in the state. “As a result, the number of people getting infected by novel coronavirus is rising by the day and so is the dead count. It is unprecedented. Hospitals don’t have beds for patients, ambulances don’t have adequate oxygen and cremation grounds don’t have space to accommodate bodies for last rites,” the former UP CM said. The SP chief said people were going through unbearable pain in high load districts where not only medical facilities are inadequate but officials have also turned a blind eye to the people’s agony.“In Bareilly people are forced to perform cremations on sidewalks as there is no space left at the cremation ground and authorities have failed to provide space to accommodate more pyres. In Prayagraj exorbitant rates are being charged for pyre wood. The situation is no different in Ghaziabad, Kanpur Agra,” he said. Akhilesh said the state capital seems to be the worst hit as the hospitals don’t have beds to accommodate more patients. There are no ambulances to ferry patients and people are compelled to wait with their ailing wards outside hospitals for days as a result of which many of them died without being provided any medical assistance whatsoever.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-govt-unable-to-control-pandemic-should-quit-akhilesh/articleshow/82152683.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Lucknow||Sugar production goes down in UP||Lucknow: Sugar production in UP has gone down by eight lakh tonnes this year in comparison to last year when the novel coronavirus triggered lockdown restricted functioning of industries and movement of cane growers. According to data of Indian Sugar Mills Association, UP recorded a production of 100.86 lakh tonnes of sugar till April 15 this year in comparison to 108.25 lakh tonnes registered during the corresponding period last year. Interestingly, sugar production nationally grew by over 42 lakh tonnes — from 248.25 lakh tonnes in April 15, 2020 to 291 lakh tonnes at the same time this year. Data showed that in UP, 66 mills were in operation, as compared to 98 mills which were functional during the same period last year. Of the total 120 mills, 54 have stopped crushing. Industry experts said that the dip in sugar production was essentially because of the decrease in sugar recovery as well as lessening of cane cultivation. On the contrary, Maharashtra, which has been behind UP for the past few years, saw a sharp rise of 43.19 lakh tonnes in sugar production -- from 60.76 lakh tonnes last year to 104 lakh tonnes this year. The same was true for Karnataka which also saw a rise in sugar production from 33.82 lakh tonnes in 2020 to 41.45 lakh tonnes this year. Sugar production also increased in case of Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. The association further quoted market reports to point out that around 29.72 lakh tonnes of sugar was exported out of the country during October, 2020 to March, 2021. This was, however, marginally less as compared to about 30.64 lakh tonnes exported in the last sugar year during the same period. In the current year, major export destinations have been Indonesia and Afghanistan, which account for almost 48% of total exports. The total sugar sale in the domestic market, according to the association, up to March, 2021 stood at 129.48 lakh tonnes. Last year, during the same period sugar sales were estimated at 130.29 lakh tonnes. The association pointed out that last year, post March, 2020, sugar sales got affected due to the country wide lockdown and consequent closure of restaurants, malls, movie halls, etc., which in turn impacted the demand for sugar sweetened products like ice cream, beverages, juices, confectionery and sweets. This year, though there are night curfew and lockdowns with certain limitations in some states/ regions but conditions are somewhat different as this year restrictions are more organized and directives, including standard operating procedures, are already in place due to which disruption in supply chain is expected to be minimal, ISMA said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sugar-production-goes-down-in-up/articleshow/82152684.cms||Pankaj Shah

About 130 policemen will be donating their blood for the Covid patients who are in the need of plasma.“Nearly 250 policemen posted in the city were infected with Coronavirus in the last one year. Over 130 of them have agreed to donate blood for a cause. The policemen will be asked to donate their blood as and when we get a call from the needy. We will also encourage other cops to donate plasma,” said Shamsher Singh, city police commissioner who took the initiative.The donors include cops of all the ranks from DCP to police constables. “After a spike in Covid-19 cases over last few weeks, the demand for plasma has gone up but there are not enough donors. Many citizens contact the police department too for seeking help as there is a shortage of plasma. So, we decided to extend a helping hand,” Singh told TOI. Some of the police officials, though, were sceptical about donating their blood and felt that they may face some medical complications. “I arranged for an online meeting between the donor policemen and the medicos on Sunday. The doctors explained the benefits of donating plasma and how it can help save many lives. Over 130 policemen then agreed for the donation,” Singh added.A police sub-inspector posted in Warasia police station donated his plasma five days ago. PSI Arun Mishra said that apart from saving lives, he wanted to inspire other policemen to donate their plasma for the needy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/130-vadodara-cops-to-donate-plasma-for-covid-19-patients/articleshow/82151816.cms||Tushar Tere

However, it did not provide clarity on the court’s specific direction to implement a partial lockdown in five districts of Lucknow, Kanpur Nagar, Prayagraj, Varanasi and Gorakhpur from Monday night.

In addition, the suspects have also been slapped with the sections of the Epidemic Diseases Act, the Disaster Management Act and other relevant Acts. The allegations had caused serious tensions in the area.

The transfer orders of the police personnel were reversed the very next day.On April 14, Feroz Khan, the owner of the salon, was caught illegally keeping his shop open despite the enforcement of strict Covid-19 restrictions on all commercial establishments barring emergency services. During a conversation with the police patrolling team, he fell on the shutter of the shop and sustained a deep head injury. Khan was rushed to a hospital where he was declared dead.

After the reservation of seat for Schedule caste, Ramphal Balmiki, a close confidante of Mulayam had been fielded this time from Saifai. Alike, late village head of Saifai -Darshan, who had been winning panchayat elections unopposed, chances were strong this time too that Balmiki most likely would be elected unopposed. However, the nomination of a village woman Vimla had broken the tradition of unopposed election in Saifai. “It would be for the first time, when the village voted to elect their representative. There has always been an unopposed pradhan elected from Saifai,” said a group of voters at Rajkiya Balika Inter College in Saifai. Balmiki has been politically active with the SP patriarch since 1967. Recalling his old days with party founder Mulayam, Balmiki had stated that he had accompanied him on party’s ‘Kranti Rath’ on many occasions. Balmiki while filing his nomination remembered late village head Darshan Singh Yadav, and said, “He was like my elder brother and a strong pillar and was a guardian figure for people of Saifai. I always used to address him as ‘Guruji’. His contribution to Saifai is an inspiration.” He had expressed his gratitude to SP patriarch Mulayam, party president Akhilesh Yadav, Prof Ram Gopal Yadav, Shivpal Yadav, former Badaun MP Dharmendra Yadav and former Mainpuri MP Tej Pratap Yadav for instilling confidence in him and fielding him for the village head post of their native village Saifai. Balmiki’s wife had been elected as district Panchayat member several times. The post for the gram pradhan of Saifai has been declared as Scheduled Castes seat for the first time. The village will now get a fresh face after a long gap of 50 years. Since 1972, the post of village head was with Darshan Singh Yadav, a close confidante of Mulayam and Akhilesh who had passed away after prolonged illness in October last year. He had been representing Saifai, their native village in Etawah district, for the past 48 years as village ‘pradhan’ (head).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/saifai-votes-first-time-to-elect-village-head/articleshow/82150856.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

This will be in addition to one with 600 beds proposed earlier at Divisional Sports Complex, Mankapur, in the city Raut also announced reduction in timings for all essential shops in Nagpur, which will now remain open only from 7am to 11am. Only fruit and milk shops will also be allowed to open in the evening from 5.30pm to 7.30pm. Raut said in a press conference on Monday, “Lloyds Metals has 260 metric tonne oxygen, which is a huge quantity. There are various problems in transporting it from Wardha to city and filling oxygen in jumbo cylinders. Therefore, Jumbo Covid Hospital will begin in the plant premises with 200 beds, which will go up to 1,000 beds in a phased manner. A team of experts led by divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar has already visited the plant and will submit detailed project report (DPR),” he said. Raut later told TOI, “I have received the DPR and it’s feasible. The team also identified two sprawling halls situated along the oxygen pipeline in the plant. A centre will be established in the city, where patients requiring oxygen will be shortlisted and sent to Wardha through ambulances. The facility will also be made available for patients from other districts of Vidarbha.” Raut added, “Oxygen is also available at Mahagenco’s Koradi and Khaparkheda thermal power stations. I sent a team headed by collector Ravindra Thakre to the two power stations to explore the possibility of setting up hospitals with 100 beds. Compressor is required to use more oxygen produced at these two hospitals. I directed Mahagenco to get it from China as soon as possible,” he said. Confirming that the district faced severe shortage of oxygen a day ago, when only one tanker arrived instead of two, Raut said, “Measures have been chalked out to overcome shortage of oxygen. Four tankers with 15 metric tonne arrived on Monday, from which we also distributed to Gondia, Wardha and Chhindwara. More tankers are coming from Bhilai steel plant. Two air separation units will be procured under CSR, which will provide oxygen to 50 beds each at GMCH and IGGMCH. Also, 1,000 oxygen concentrator machines will be procured of which 500 each will be given to city and rural to facilitate oxygen in hospitals. A permanent plant will be developed at Hingna.” Raut said order for 100 more ventilators has been placed for GMCH and IGGMCH. Union minister Nitin Gadkari also received 125 ventilators from a company and distributed them to hospitals on Monday. Raut said deans of GMCH and IGGMCH were directed to explore possibility of increasing beds. “Number of beds at these two hospitals has already increased, with 8,128 beds available in the district as on today,” he said. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) was supposed to start Covid Hospitals at KT Nagar and Pachpaoli Women’s Hospital with oxygen beds on Monday. The civic body postponed this due to shortage of oxygen. Raut said oxygen tanks will be established at Pachpaoli Women’s Hospital, where liquid oxygen will be filled in tanks and given to patients so that there is no requirement of refilling jumbo oxygen cylinders. On testing, Raut said medical education minister Amit Deshmukh has assured to provide CRISPR Feluda machine, which will facilitate results of RT-PCR within 30 minutes. “It’s accuracy is 95%,” the minister said. On shortage of Remdisivir drug, Raut said, “There is a crisis across the country. Production is less due to shortage of raw material from foreign countries. District got 3,000 vials which will be distributed tomorrow. I requested two companies to send 25,000 vials. We approved production at Wardha plant but it will take at least 14 days for sterilization. District may get stock from this plant from May 10 onwards, subject to availability of raw material,” he said. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B issued an order on Monday reducing timings of essential shops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/1000-bed-jumbo-covid-hospital-at-wardha-steel-plant-for-vidarbha-patients/articleshow/82151754.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh CM asks hospitals with 100 beds to set up own plants||LUCKNOW: Claiming that there is no shortage of oxygen in the state, the UP government on Monday said it has acquired 750 tons of oxygen from the Centre on Monday. Other than this, 81 units across the state are producing more than 900 tons of oxygen per day. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath said, he has asked all hospitals with 100 beds or more to set up their own oxygen plants. This would reduce their dependency on liquid oxygen to a great extent, said a government spokesperson. “The CM said that a plan should be prepared to implement this in existing hospitals and all hospitals which come in future should have this facility. MLA funds can be used for this purpose,” he said. The CM also said that National Security Act and Gangsters Act will be invoked against anyone hoarding and black marketing lifesaving drugs and oxygen. The government will also take steps to confiscate their properties. Addressing a review meeting of Team-11 on Monday, the CM said several MSMEs and large industrial enterprises produce oxygen. Looking at the current situation, it has been decided that the oxygen produced by these enterprises will be used only for medical purposes. He directed the MSME and industrial development departments to constitute a team and follow up on this and ensure that hospitals close to these units are supplied the oxygen. He directed the authorities concerned to assess the state’s current and future demand for oxygen before it approached the Centre. This would help ensure that there is no shortage of oxygen. The food safety and drug administration department’s control room should be in touch with all the districts on a regular basis and find out whether they need medicines and oxygen. Additonal chief secretary (information) Navneet Sehgal said, officials have been appointed to coordinate between the district administration and oxygen producers so that oxygen could be made available in any area where there was a shortage. Alok Kumar, principal secretary (medical education) said, 13 oxygen plants are being set up in the state, five of which are being set up by DRDO in Ram Manohar Lohia Institute and Cancer Institute in Lucknow, the medical colleges in Kanpur, Agra and Jhansi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-asks-hosps-with-100-beds-to-set-up-own-plants/articleshow/82152695.cms||---

Authorities in Kamareddy are faced with this situation as some of the villages in Madnur and Jukkal mandals have pathways that lead to the neighbouring states. On the other hand, villages are going in to self-lockdown because of the increasing number of Covid-19 cases. Nizamabad district collector C Narayana Reddy on Monday asked local residents of Bodhan, in particular, to be cautious as this being close to the border with Maharashtra, there was a likelihood of the spread of Covid-19 if precautions were not taken. “Come out of your houses only if you must,” the collector told the public during his visit to Bodhan. At the government hospital in Bodhan, another 50 beds have been added to the area hospital for treatment of patients. Critical cases will be referred to the district hospital. There is a considerable movement of people from Bodhan to Maharashtra everyday and the authorities have advised people to restrict themselves from travelling. In some districts, authorities have noticed that public movement through pathways in the forest areas or borders areas which people have been using to avoid checkposts. Police who identified some of these have blocked that paths too. With cases increasing, a number of villages have announced lockdown allowing shops to remain open only for four hours in the morning and two hours in the evening to allow people to buy essentials. In Balkonda of Nizamabad, apart from the mandal headquarters, such restritions have been imposed in Kothapalli, Nagampet and Chittapur. A lockdown has been announced from April 21 in Jinnaram. Shops will be open only up to 2 pm up to Tuesday and thereafter a complete lockdown will be enforced. Out of the more than 4,000 Covid-19 cases in Telangana on April 18, as many as 360 are from Nizamabad itself and this has put officials on extra alert with villages going into lockdown. Weekly market in Nandipet was cancelled on Monday to prevent the spread of Covid-19. In Neredigonda in Adilabad district, the partial lockdown will continue up to April 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cases-up-villages-enforce-lockdown/articleshow/82151830.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

Though Rokade had complained of a cold and cough, three of his RT-PCR tests came up negative. It was the CT scan report on April 10, though, that showed an infection in his lungs and confirmed he had Covid-19. He had no comorbidities. Rokade was recovering well at Sion Hospital and had even conveyed to his seniors though WhatsApp that he would resume duty in a day or two. His condition deteriorated, though, after his oxygen level dipped suddenly and he succumbed on Sunday afternoon. His wife, too, had tested positive and is undergoing treatment at the hospital. Meanwhile, one more SRPF personnel succumbed in the past 24 hours, taking the virus’ state police force toll to 384. State deputy superintendent of police, cyber, Vijay Khaire said, “Rokade was dedicated to his work and used to prepare the cyber crime head reports of the entire state. He was prompt in framing replies to all questions raised in the assembly. His death has left all in the department in shock because he was a cyclist, a keen walker and a fitness freak. He used to cycle from the World Trade Centre office to his Chunabhatti home or walk from the office to the CSMT station daily.” Rokade is survived by his wife, two daughters and his mother. His late father was a policeman too. Superintendent of police (state cyber) Sanjay Shintre confirmed this is the first Covid-related death in the state cyber cell. So far, 38,232 cops have tested positive in the state, 34,106 of whom have recovered. — V Narayan||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cyclist-cop-who-tested-ve-3-times-before-scan-dies-1-more-succumbs/articleshow/82149763.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

The decision was taken following the instruction from Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal to the DMs of Patna, Nalanda, Bhojpur, Buxar, Rohtas and Kaimur to ensure that non-essential shops open on alternate days only. He asked the DMs to fix the days as per requirement. As per the order issued by the Patna district administration, non-essential shops dealing in electrical (fan, cooler & AC) and electronic goods (mobile, laptop, computer, battery, UPS) and their repair shops, salons or parlours, furniture and ornament shops would open on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Shops selling garments, utensils, homeware, sports equipment and farm products besides dry cleaners and others would open on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. The new restrictions will be followed till May 15.  “Violation of this restriction will invite action under the Epidemic Disease Act, 1897. Teams have been formed to ensure the compliance of the order,” the DM said. Agarwal also instructed the DMs to identify the hotspots in their respective districts, including rural areas and tolas, and create big containment zones by barricading the areas and restricting the movement of outsiders. In a virtual meeting on Monday, Agarwal said strict measures will be taken in such containment zones to curb the Covid-19 spread, while health teams need to do contact tracing and collect samples of people living in such localities. “The area will be barricaded and containment zone banner will be placed. However, essential services would remain unaffected. SDOs, magistrates and other officers need to keep a strict vigil in containment zones,” he said. The divisional commissioner asked the DMs to ensure strict implementation of Section 144 (gathering of more than five people at a time in public places) in their districts. Agarwal said all magistrates and police officers should ensure that doctors, paramedical staff and medical shopkeepers coming to the hospitals and shops don’t face any obstruction under the new restrictions. “Public transport will remain unaffected and people going to railway station, airport and bus stand would not face any problem,” he said. “The district officials need to make people aware in different areas through microphones about adopting Covid-appropriate behaviour and to adhere to the new restrictions,” Agarwal said. Patna DM said the SDOs have been asked to identify the hotspots to club micro-containment areas into bigger containment zones. Presently, there are more than 380 micro-containment areas in Patna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/non-essential-shops-to-open-on-alternate-days/articleshow/82151831.cms||Faryal Rumi

Those who failed to appear for FA1, but registered for the SSC exam, will most likely be awarded minimum pass marks in all subjects, said officials. The SSC board will submit its proposal to the state by April 26. “Looks like we have no other option but to consider FA1marks,” said A Satyanarayana Reddy, director of government examinations (DGE). He said that about 90% of the students appeared for the FA1 that was conducted in March 2021. He said that even attendance cannot be taken as one of the criteria as schools were physically open for only a month or two. “Schools are still uploading the data pertaining to FA1. We will know the exact number of students who appeared for this exam once the data is uploaded,” he added. With schools remaining closed for most part of the academic year, Telangana School Education Department had decided to reduce the number of assessments by half. As per the academic calendar for 2020-21 released by the state in January 2021,the summative assessment exams were scheduled to be held from May 7 to May 13. Similarly, formative assessment was slated for March and April.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fa-marks-to-be-used-to-grade-ssc-students/articleshow/82151869.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Cops take oxygen forcibly from plant to save lives, land in trouble||NAGPUR: A team of Jaripatka police, including the night officer, is facing an inquiry after using strong arm tactics to arrange oxygen cylinders for 15 critical Covid patients’ in ICU of a private hospital on Kamptee road. The officer got the cylinders to the hospital that had barely two hours’ supply left by virtually robbing an oxygen plant. It is learnt the management of the Nimunabai Tirpude Hospital sent a message to Jaripatka police station shortly after the Sunday midnight that lives of 15 Covid patients was at risk as oxygen supply may not last after 5 am. The hospital received its regular oxygen supply from a Mouda-based plant which was not responding to their repeated calls, said Dr Shivaji Supalkar of the Tirpude Hospital. The plant also did not even allow Tirpude Hospital’s vehicle to enter its premises. The hospital authorities, however, did not call up the collector or NMC control room for oxygen. Instead they raised their problem in a social media group of the nodal officers and other senior officials of the civic body and the district administration. NMC Addl commissioner Jalaj Sharma is learnt to have asked the hospital to pick up 10 cylinders from a plant at Hingna viewing the criticality of the situation. The hospital had by then also approached the Jaripatka police station. PSI Mahadeo Naikwade, who was on night duty there, alerted the control room after receiving letter from hospital stating 15 patients were at grave risk for want of oxygen. The control room informed Naikwade about an oxygen plant at Yashodhara Nagar where the the officer landed up with his team. The Yashodhara Nagar plant was unwilling to spare any cylinder because an earlier order from collector had asked all oxygen plants to supply only as per quota allotted to hospital by his office. PSI Naikwade, emotionally moved by the situation, forcibly took seven oxygen cylinders and delivered them to Tirpude Hospital. Though his act may have saved lives, it did not go down well with the senior officials as there were some gross violations involved including that of collector’s orders. The hospital authorities said they were panicked by the situation and approached the cops fearing anger by patient’s kin if something untoward happened. “The PSI’s act ensured oxygen for our patients and we are ready to pay whatever amount is due. The cylinders helped us continue till our normal supply was restored,” said Dr Supalkar. Zonal DCP Neelotpal said an inquiry has been instituted under the concerned ACP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-take-oxygen-forcibly-from-plant-to-save-lives-land-in-trouble/articleshow/82151833.cms||Soumitra Bose

In a videoconference meeting with the lieutenant governor, the chairperson of Delhi Disaster Management Authority, Delhi BJP MPs, its president Adesh Gupta and leader of Opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri also sought permission for the municipal corporations to set up Covid quarantine centres in their community halls and schools. “We informed the LG about the problems being faced by people of Delhi, especially Covid patients and migrant labourers, and made several suggestions that can bring relief to them,” said Gupta. The weeklong restrictions in Delhi has triggered a rush of migrant labourers at railway stations and bus stands to leave the city. The BJP-run corporations have several schools under them and thousands of beds at civic hospitals. The party functionaries alleged that the current situation required a collective effort but chief minister Arvind Kejriwal was not ready to involve the opposition. “During last year’s Covid lockdown, the municipal corporations played a prominent role in helping people, but this time Delhi government is not involving them,” Gupta alleged. Delhi government is claiming that 2,500 beds are still vacant in hospitals, “but the truth is that people are running around for beds. Oxygen, too, is in short supply”, he said. The government should arrange a centralised system to provide medicines to home isolation patients because in some families, all members are down with Covid, they said. “Complaints are coming of medical advice not reaching these patients. A system should be set up to ensure medical counselling for them,” Bidhuri said. Former Delhi BJP chief and MP Manoj Tiwari, MPs Meenakshi Lekhi, Ramesh Bidhuri, Parvesh Sahib Singh and Gautam Gambhir, and MLA Vijender Gupta also attended the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ensure-shelter-ration-for-migrants-bjp-to-lg/articleshow/82169440.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||Former BJP MP booked by forest department||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat forest department has registered a case against former MP of BJP, Mahesh Giri, for carrying out the construction of a water tank at Kamandal Kund in Girnar. The tank was being built within the sanctuary area without permission from the National Board for Wildlife or the state board for wildlife. Senior forest official said that on April 16, during patrolling the field staff noticed that the construction of the water tank which was halted in 2018 has again begun. They then stopped the construction. But Mahant Mahesh Giri, an ex-member of Parliament from Delhi East, refused to adhere to the request of the forest department and threatened to continue the construction. After this, a case was registered against him. A senior officer in the forest department said, “The former MP was using his political clout to bring pressure on superior officers. He even called up senior officials from ministries, who called up our seniors in the state bureaucracy.” Officials said that the tank was constructed for supplying water to pilgrims, and the trust said they wanted to raise the level by seven feet. But it was just to get the tank level up to the level of the temple which would have given the trust more space to use. Forest officials said that earlier, during a routine patrolling, an area adjoining the Kamandal Kund was found to have some construction. A case was registered at the time against Muktanandswami on July 22, 2018. At that time the construction work was prevented by the staff, but in May 2019 the staff again found a new RCC structure being made in the same place. A notice was then issued to Muktanandswami. The illegal construction activity continued despite several notices. Muktanandswami later died in October 2020, and the forest department took possession of the structure and the case was withdrawn. Again on April 16, 2021, during patrolling, the local staff noticed preparations for renewed construction activity to increase the height of the structure, though it was already under formal possession of the forest department. The note sent by the field officials to the senior officials stated that the forester on the round, Bordevi, contacted Mahesh Giri Maharaj (who is presently handling the administration of the Kamandal Kund) and requested him not to undertake any illegal work at the site. “The maharaj took the matter otherwise and used his political clout to convey a one-sided version to the higher authorities. This falsely portrayed the forest department as an aggressor in the matter leading to an unavoidable confrontation,” the note stated. Mahesh Giri, was even heard in person by the chief conservator of forests, Junagadh, and Giri insisted that the structure that his disciple Muktanandswami had made in the past needs to be completed. The note stated that the Mahesh Giri is an ex-member of Parliament and is well aware of the legal provisions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/former-bjp-mp-booked-by-forest-department/articleshow/82152721.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

Contrary to perceptions that more younger people are getting infected in the second wave given their higher mobility, officials cited surveillance data from the Centre’s Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) which shows around 32% patients (both hospitalised and outside hospitals) were aged less than 30 in the second wave, as against 31% during the first wave. Among people aged 30-40, the incidence of infection remains unchanged at 21% during both the waves. Live updates: CoronavirusIn case of hospitalised patients, younger people (0-39 years) are slightly more vulnerable in the second wave as compared to the first despite opening up of economic activities and general movement. Around 5.8% of patients hospitalised are 0-19 years, compared to 4.2% in the first wave. Similarly, hospitalised cases in the 20-39 bracket increased to 25.5% from 23.7% earlier. Around 70% hospitalised patients in both waves are 40 and above, indicating that older people continue to be more vulnerable. Coronavirus: Complete coverageThe data also shows a higher proportion of asymptomatic patients got admitted in hospitals in the second wave with more complaints of breathlessness. The percentage of deaths in hospitalised patients remains unchanged during the interim analysis of the second wave conducted on 1,885 people during March-April. The analysis of the first wave was done on 7,600 people during September-November 2020. According to the analysis of hospitalised Covid-19 patients by the Indian Council of Medical Research, 47.5% patients have reported shortness of breath during the second wave, against 41.7% in the first wave, explaining the recent rise in demand for oxygen.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); A total of 41.1% of patients during the first wave required oxygen, with the share rising to 54.5% in the second, the demographic study based on data collected from 40 centres across the country shows. It also found that 37.3% hospitalised patients required mechanical ventilation during the second wave, whereas the number was 27.8% in the first wave. Almost 55% of the patients in the first wave had at least one comorbidity. However, during the second wave, the share of such patients dropped to 48.6%.

Burning biomass in the city is prohibited by the National Green Tribunal and orders to that effect have been issued by both KMC and the state pollution control board. The practice of burning garbage, dead wood and leaves came to light after the simmering smoulders ignited a flame on Sunday night and set of a fire that required a fire tender to douse. The fire happened around 800 metres from the giraffe enclosure. Speaking to TOI, zoo director A K Samanta acknowledged that “branches and leaves falling from trees and other garbage were usually burnt on that spot.” “On Sunday afternoon, too, we burnt some garbage there. Later at night, one of our staff spotted flames and informed us. We informed the fire services department that sent an engine soon and doused the fire,” said Samanta.

US Bhartia, chairperson and managing director of IGL, told TOI that he had a discussion with chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday and immediately decided to ramp up the production capacity for medical use oxygen by diverting industrial oxygen, so that it could be supplied to hospitals. “We make a small quantity of medical oxygen and thought we would ramp up industrial production to medical use production. I pledged 35-40 tons of oxygen a day to the CM. It is being produced in IGL’s Kashipur plant in Uttaranchal and is being transported to Lucknow and Gorakhpur in liquid form via tankers,” Bhartia said. The exercise is being monitored by additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Awasthi. An IGL spokesperson said that their Kashipur plant had a capacity to produce around 20 tons of medical grade liquid oxygen per day. After the conversation with the UP CM, the company increased its capacity to 60 tons per day by diverting industrial grade oxygen and converting it to medical grade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-gets-40-ton-oxygen-from-igl/articleshow/82152744.cms||---

---||Chennai||Extend PMGKP scheme to health sector, says MP||Villupuram: The call to extend the Union government's insurance scheme -- Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package (PMGKP) -- of providing financial assistance to the families of healthcare professionals, who die while on duty in the fight against Covid-19, has gained momentum after appeals by Villupuram MP D Ravikumar and the Indian Medical Association (IMA). In a letter to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan dated April 18, Ravikumar said he was shocked to learn that Union government had stopped the PMGKP insurance scheme at 'this critical time when the second wave of Covid-19 infection is hitting the country'. The scheme, which was introduced by the Union government in March last year, lapsed on March 24 this year. The Centre decided not to extend the scheme but introduce a ‘new dispensation to cover Covid-19 warriors’. The scheme provided compensation of up to Rs 50 lakh to the families of the healthcare professionals who die while on duty in fighting the Covid-19 infection. In a letter addressed to secretary (health and family welfare) Rajesh Bhushan dated April 19, IMA national president J A Jayabal and honorary secretary general Jayesh M Lele pointed out that the World Health Organization (WHO) had warned that 14% of healthcare professionals were likely to be infected and the mortality rate among them was much more than the general public. The duo urged the secretary to keep the insurance option open and make it user friendly. "There is a growing shortage of doctors as they are overworked and stressed out. It is the responsibility of the government to keep their morale high with adequate care and open-minded support," they said. They urged the government to extend the insurance scheme for another six months, expedite and ease out the bottlenecks of the procedure and ensure all healthcare professionals are recognized and adequately compensated for their dedicated services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/extend-pmgkp-scheme-to-health-sector-says-mp/articleshow/82151867.cms||Bosco Dominique
---||Delhi||District courts to take up urgent matters via videoconferencing||New Delhi: Citing the exponential rise in novel coronavirus cases in the national capital, Delhi High Court on Monday ordered district courts in the city to take up only urgent matters and that too through videoconferencing.The national capital had on Sunday recorded the biggest jump in its daily Covid-19 tally with 25,462 fresh cases, while the Covid positivity rate shot up to 29.7 per cent — meaning almost every third sample being tested in the city is turning out to be Covid-19 positive.The direction by Delhi High Court comes a day after the court had decided that from April 19 onwards, it would only take up “extremely urgent matters” filed this year.The high court order said, “In view of the alarming rise in Covid-19 cases in the National Capital Territory of Delhi, in continuation of this court’s earlier office order dated April 8, 2021, it is ordered that all the judicial officers of district courts in Delhi shall take up only urgent cases of their respective courts, through videoconferencing mode.”The order, issued by the office of Delhi High Court registrar general Manoj Jain, added: “All other matters listed before district courts be adjourned en bloc by respective courts and information in this regard be uploaded on the website(s) of Delhi district courts.”On April 8, the high court had decided that from April 9 to April 23, it will take up matters through virtual mode only in view of the rise in Covid-19 cases. A similar direction was issued to the district courts also on April 8.From March 25 last year, owing to the nation-wide novel coronavirus-induced lockdown, the functioning of the high court and district courts was restricted and no physical hearing was being conducted due to the spread of Covid-19. Partial physical hearings were resumed in September last year and complete physical hearings restarted in March.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/district-courts-to-take-up-urgent-matters-via-videoconferencing/articleshow/82151864.cms||---

The investigation is continuing,” he added.Delhi government didn’t respond to the development till the time of going to press.The FIR was filed on the basis of an inquiry conducted into the allegations that DUSIB, which comes under the government of Delhi, had invested its surplus funds in the form of fixed deposit receipts (FDRs) in different banks and diverted the same into suspected fake accounts.“It was alleged that during 2020-2021, DUSIB transferred money from five different accounts maintained in Central Bank of India, Vikas Kutir branch, to Bank of Baroda, Paharganj branch, for the purpose of investing in FDRs, but some officials of DUSIB, in conspiracy with the unknown officials of Bank of Baroda, Paharganj Branch diverted funds to the tune of Rs 208 crore (sic),” the CBI said in a statement.According to the FIR, instead of issuing genuine FDRs, the money was diverted to an account in the name of a private firm and was also transferred to a fake account in the name of DUSIB in Bank of Baroda, Paharganj Branch.CBI’s inquiry has revealed that the money transferred to the Bank of Baroda for the purpose of making FDRs was diverted through the fake account of DUSIB and the documents provided to DUSIB were allegedly fake FDRs printed on normal paper.“In total, 112 documents (FDRs) of Rs 214 crore were given by the bank to DUSIB. It was further alleged that of these, only three amounting to Rs 6,01,59, 735 were found to be genuine in the name of DUSIB, while rest of the 109 FDRs were suspected to be forged,” the CBI’s statement read.In another operation, CBI has arrested four people, including an official of the Delhi State Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (DSIIDC), in a bribery case.“A case was registered on a complaint against two private persons and unknown public servants on the allegations of demanding a bribe for getting the work completed regarding execution of lease of a complainant’s plot, from the officials of DSIIDC,” the CBI said.According to the Central Bureau of Investigation, the complainant’s application of lease was pending since 23.02.2021. “CBI laid a trap and caught a person while demanding and accepting a bribe of Rs 10,000 as first instalment from the complainant.

Al Rayyan appeared to be cruising along nicely with goals from Shoja Khalilzadeh (13th minute) and Abdel Hatim (54th). There were chances to swell that two-goal lead which the Qatar Stars League side missed. At the other end, Al Wahda kept hunting for a goal and once substitute Manea Ayed Al Ruwais pulled a goal back in the 66th minute, their confidence soared. Khalil Ibrahim then got the equaliser with five minutes left to be played, and just when everyone believed the teams would take home a point each, Juma ensured Al Wahda had the last laugh with a goal in the fifth minute of added time. Before they could even complete their wild celebrations, which included coach Henk ten Cate and his staff on the sidelines, the referee blew the final whistle. It was a stunning comeback from a side that needed the three points to keep themselves in the hunt for a place in the knockout stage of the competition. With Persepolis FC in pole position to top the group, the battle is now for the second spot. Al Wahda have occupied the second spot behind Persepolis with four points, thanks to their first win in three games. Al Rayyan have one point at the end of the third round. The teams play each other again on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/al-wahda-fight-back-from-two-goals-down-to-win-five-goal-thriller/articleshow/82169516.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Delhi||52-year-old district court judge succumbs to Covid||New Delhi: The raging Covid-19 pandemic on Monday claimed the life of a Delhi district court judge, who was hospitalised a couple of days ago. Known among colleagues and lawyers as an “excellent” human, Kovai Venugopal, 52, was presiding over a family court at Saket district courts.In its report on April 19, TOI had highlighted the grim situation in district courts in the national capital with judicial officers and staff testing positive for the virus. From the data available online, it is learnt that over 30 judges have either tested positive or isolated themselves and over 60 judicial staff members also tested positive.Family courts data shows that at least two family court judges, including Venugopal, and two staffers either tested positive or were asked to isolate themselves in the last few weeks.“We have lost one of the finest judges today. Venugopal was very kind, suave and a wonderful human being. Life will never be the same for his wife and seven-year-old daughter,” said a colleague.The subordinate judiciary is facing a tough time with the rise in the positivity rate among its officers and staff. The situation also led Delhi High Court to order district courts to take up only urgent matters via videoconferencing and adjourn all other cases.In 2018, when Venugopal presided over a special court dealing with anti-corruption matters, he came across an appeal filed by a man who had been awarded one-year imprisonment and Rs 2,000 fine on a theft charge. When it came to deciding his appeal, the judge took a humane view owing to the man’s young age at the time of offence, saying he might have been a “victim of circumstances like poverty, bad company”. The convict’s jail term was, therefore, modified to the time already spent during judicial custody and his fine reduced to Rs 500.Advocate Arpit Bhargava, who appeared before Venugopal a few years ago during the latter’s stint as Delhi High Court’s joint registrar, recounted the judge’s well-natured conduct during the proceedings.“Judge Venugopal was extremely graceful and patient when it came to dealing with lawyers. He was well-adept at conducting court hearings especially during his tenure as a joint registrar,” he said.Some lawyers took to social media to express condolences. “Judge Venugopal was an excellent judge. Soft spoken and considerate always (sic). Good on law points too. Losing him to Covid — most heart breaking news for trial lawyers,” advocate Tanvi tweeted.“Tragic loss. Revered judge Venugopal has left for heavenly abode. RIP sir. I remember whenever I attended his court, I always saw him wearing a mask and (he) ensured social distancing. Such sad news,” read another tweet from Vikrant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/52-year-old-district-court-judge-succumbs-to-covid/articleshow/82151872.cms||Aamir Khan

Sabarmati Riverfront police registered a case on Sunday following a complaint from Savita Datania, Sunita’s grandmother. The complainant stated that Sunita was earlier married to one Govind Patani. However, Patani came to know that Sunita was in love with Deepak. So Patani divorced Sunita. Later, Deepak’s family demanded that Sunita marry him and she complied. According to the complaint, over time, Sunita discovered that Deepak was in an illicit relationship with his sister-in-law and with another woman in the area. This led to quarrels between the two. Deepak allegedly assaulted Sunita during an argument. Sunita was then forced to leave Deepak and she stayed with her grandmother. At the time, Sunita was six months pregnant. Even after their son was born, Deepak did not reunite with her despite her pleas. The complainant stated that on April 12, Sunita left home with her son. The complainant said that on April 15, police showed her the photograph of Sunita and the child and informed her they were dead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/woman-jumps-into-sabarmati-with-1-yr-old-son/articleshow/82152779.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Never met witness Ajit Singh: Sukhbir||Chandigarh: SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Monday said he had never met Ajit Singh, a witness in Kotkapura police firing case of 2015, and threatened to file a defamation case against IG Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh for falsely claiming that he (Sukhbir) had tried to lure the witness with the promise of a job in SGPC. The SAD president said it was clear that Kunwar was obsessed with targeting the SAD and the Badal family and it was with this purpose that he had forwarded a malicious letter to the Punjab DGP and made these wild allegations. “The IG knew from the proceedings of the Kotkapura firing case in the high court that his probe would be set aside. The latest allegation is a result of this deep-rooted frustration and aimed at politicising a case after wasting three years, pursuing the political agenda of the Congress party,” he said. Sukhbir added that Kunwar tried to implicate the SAD and its senior leadership in the case at the instance of the Congress government but he was unsuccessful and is now taking the letter route to defame them. “It is a clear case of gross misuse of his official position by the IG to please his political bosses, rather than nailing the culprits,” said Sukhbir. The SAD president asserted that Ajit has also set the record straight by asserting that he had not been approached by anyone for a job in SGPC, which he had done himself. “The witness has also submitted that even this request is pending and that he has not been offered any job by the SGPC,” he said. Sukhbir said his lawyers are looking into the case to ascertain if there is a wider conspiracy to defame him. The SAD MP from Ferozepur said that his party had always stood for speedy investigation into all cases related to the heinous incidents of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/never-met-witness-ajit-singh-sukhbir/articleshow/82152772.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Covid-19 surge: Varsities bring in stricter rules for hostels||New Delhi: After several Covid cases were reported from the university campuses, Jawaharlal Nehru University and Delhi University hostels have placed stringent advisories and rules for the students. In JNU, dhabas and canteens have been shut, while the mess has been functioning in limited capacity. This, however, has become a major concern for the students. At DU’s Gwyer Hall, where five cases were reported recently, students have raised concerns about lack of security and facilities, which has prompted many of them to leave for their hometowns. JNU’s Diksha Singh, an MSc physics student, has already booked her tickets. “It is not safe to be in the hostel now. We have to go to the mess to eat and fill water bottles. Our toilets are not sanitised well, so I have decided to leave.”On April 17, the JNU administration issued a circular stating that the sports stadium, dining facility in Aravali guesthouse canteen, along with other canteens/eateries, will be closed. The hostel residents were asked to avoid visiting other hostels. JNU Students’ Union vice-president Saket Moon said, “This puts a lot of pressure on the student movement, plus food is an added concern.” JNUSU, in its letter to the vice-chancellor, M Jagadesh Kumar, on Monday requested to “designate certain spaces as quarantine zones.” They also demanded a permanent testing facility on the campus, sanitisation of staff members and dhabas and canteens be open only for takeaways. Yogesh Shyamrao Umare, another student said, “Our inter-hostel mobility has been restricted, our stadium is shut. The library closes early and now the dhabas are shut too. If we order food from outside, we have to travel all the way to the North gate.” Though DU has not issued any advisory for students to leave for hometowns, they are a worried lot. “Mess workers come from outside and I am scared that, since we eat there, we are exposed to greater risks. We have four students who are Covid-19 positive. ”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-19-surge-varsities-bring-in-stricter-rules-for-hostels/articleshow/82151876.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Porous borders of Telangana to blame for virus spike?||HYDERABAD: Are porous borders and lack of proper checking to blame for a rapid surge in positive cases in north Telangana? Districts like Adilabad, Nizamabad, Kamareddy and Kumaram Bheem Asifabad which share borders with Maharashtra have been witnessing 200 to 300 positive cases each daily. Though checkposts have been set up along the borders, influx of 3,000 to 4,000 people (according to health department officials) from the nearby states into these districts has resulted in a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases. Also, thousands of people from Jagtial, Mancherial and Karimnagar districts who work in Mumbai and other places have come back to their native places following the restrictions imposed in Maharashtra. In some villages, the police department is bringing awareness among people not to allow vehicles through their villages into the state. On the directions of collector, some villages in Kamareddy districts have dug up trenches and erected barricades to prevent vehicular movement from Maharashtra. On Sunday alone, Nizamabad reported 360 cases, Kamareddy had 115 cases, Karimnagar 135 cases, Jagtial 175 cases, Mancherial 111 cases and Adilabad registered 72 fresh Covid-19 cases. Every district has over 2,000 active cases. For instance, Adilabad has 2,500 active cases in the past couple of weeks. Officials said only thermal screening is being done at the checkposts and people are easily gaining entry into the state. In Nizamabad district, checkposts are functioning at Kandakurthi, Salura and Pothangal, while Kamareddy district has checkposts at Madnoor and Jukkal. “We are doing only thermal screening at the checkposts. If any person has high fever, we are doing rapid antigen tests. If anybody tests positive, we are sending them back. People of Telangana origin are sent for home quarantine or to hospitals,” Nizamabad DMHO Dr A Bala Narendra told TOI. Adilabad has five checkposts on Maharashtra border like Dollara on national highway-44, Laxmipur, Ghanpur and Kobai. But, the health department has not set up any checkpost at Karanji in the district, through which people are making their way into the state. “We are keeping a vigil on the borders and on those who arrive from Maharashtra. If they have symptoms, they are being advised to go to hospitals and if they have mild symptoms they are told to do home quarantine,” a senior health official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/porous-borders-to-blame-for-spike-in-cases/articleshow/82151884.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Hyderabad||Lingojiguda: Congress may not make it unanimous||HYDERABAD: The by-poll to Lingojiguda ward in the city is unlikely to be unanimous election in favour of BJP. Though the ruling TRS has decided not to contest the by-poll after BJP leaders met TRS working president KT Rama Rao with a request not to field its candidate, Congress is unlikely to allow the saffron party to walk away with the seat without any contest The state Congress leadership is under tremendous pressure not to leave the Lingojiguda seat for BJP. Some senior state-level leaders and cadre in Lingojiguda have asked the party leadership to take TRS decision not to contest against BJP in Lingojiguda as an opportunity to expose the tacit understanding between the two parties coming out in the open now. CLP leader Bhatti Vikramarka told TOI that TRS did not back out from the contest when Congress fielded the widow of Ramreddy Venkat Reddy in Paleru constituency in 2016. Even in the by-poll to Narayankhed, TRS fielded its candidate despite Congress fielding the son of deceased MLA Kishta Reddy. . The last date for withdrawal of nominations is Tuesday (April 20) and as many as 20 candidates are in fray as on date. Those who filed nominations include the family members of Akula Ramesh Goud, the Lingojiguda corporator-elect who had died before taking oath as a corporator. The BJP office sent its version on the issue stating that after the notification for byelections, the TRS MLAs and several Congress leaders called on family members of the late Ramesh Goud and offered to leave the seat uncontested. “By chance, BJP state-level leaders ex-MLC N Ramchander Rao and Perala Shekar were present when family members of Ramesh Goud were going to meet KTR. On their request, Ramchander and Shekar accompanied them to KTR. So, it is neither a bargain nor a request but an emotional response to Ramesh Goud family’s request,” Ramchander Rao’s office said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lingojiguda-cong-may-not-make-it-unanimous/articleshow/82151881.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan University shuts hostels, students given 24 hours to vacate||JAIPUR: Rajasthan University has finally decided to close hostels on the campus and asked the students to vacate the premises within 24 hours. As the second wave of Covid spreads across the nation, Rajasthan has already announced lockdown from April 19 to May 3. The varsity has already shut physical classes and has gone online. There are 19 hostels on the campus and its constituent colleges in which more than 700 students are staying. While many students chose to return home during the weekend lockdown, others have now started the process of vacating. The hostel authorities have ordered sanitisation of the hostels after the students leave. However, many students opposed this decision and protested in front of vice-chancellor secretariat on Monday. A student said, “If we go back to the villages, they will quarantine us and we will have to stay in isolation for 15 days. We have paid the hostel fees and asking us to vacate is not correct. We are staying in single rooms with social distancing and we expect university to understand our situation.” A hostel warden said, “This is an illogical protest by students who don’t understand the gravity of the situation. Recently, a student was found positive at DBN hostel and I can say for sure many more students are possibly infected. Even if rooms are separate, mess and washrooms are common. Where can we guarantee social distancing. If the hostels are not shut down, it will become a super spreader.” In other decisions taken by the university, except the main gate, all other entrance gates will be closed. University employees and people residing on the campus will be allowed to enter after showing their identity cards. Students will not be allowed to enter the campus for any work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ru-shuts-hostels-students-given-24-hours-to-vacate/articleshow/82151882.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No proof, sex worker held for murder of cop in 2014 acquitted||MUMBAI: Six and a half years after a 34-year-old commercial sex worker was arrested for murdering a constable over his alleged blackmailing, a sessions court recently acquitted her for want of proof. The constable’s partially charred body was found from a house in a slum colony at Santacruz (W) in 2014, which the prosecution claimed was rented by the accused. However, acquitting the woman, the court said there was no proof that the accused was seen in the company of the victim before his death or that the woman lived in that house at any point of time. “...The prosecution has not succeeded to prove the chain of events to provide conclusive and satisfactory evidence that the accused was involved in committing homicide of victim. The prosecution has also not succeeded to prove that after killing the victim, the accused had tried to destroy evidence of murder,” the court said. The woman was out on bail. It was the prosecution’s case that the woman sedated the victim, strangled him and then burnt the corpse on the intervening night of September 11 and 12, 2014. People had gathered outside the house in the afternoon after they saw smoke emitting from there. The body was found in a rolled mattress inside the bathroom. It was alleged that the house was rented to the accused. The prosecution also alleged that the woman had claimed the victim owed her Rs 20 lakh and threatened to make her intimate video viral if she didn’t pay Rs 20,000 every month. The woman denied the allegations and submitted that she was falsely implicated. While the prosecution submitted that sleeping pills were recovered from the woman’s purse, the court said there was no direct evidence that the accused had actually administered those sedatives to the victim. The court also said the coroner in his deposition had not spoken about finding any traces of sedatives in the victim’s body. It further said that there was no evidence to show that the woman was living in the room where the victim was found. “As domestical and personal usable articles were not found in the room, therefore, prosecution could not prove that the accused lady was living there at any point of time,” the court said. The court also pointed out that neither was the mattress produced before the court nor did the mattress selle depose during trial. The court said this nullified the argument that the accused had purchased the mattress from a shop close by. The court also questioned how a man, claiming to have seen the woman alighting from a rickshaw with the mattress near that house, remembered its pattern after five years. In court, the man had identified a piece of cloth purportedly taken from the mattress. “ During cross-examination, he said he was facing a criminal case. The probability, as per the defence, is that the evidence by this witness is suspicious and therefore not acceptable,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-proof-sex-worker-held-for-murder-of-cop-in-14-acquitted/articleshow/82152877.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Aurangabad||Take vaccine or face action, Aurangabad Municipal Corporation chief warns 45+ citizens||AURANGABAD: Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) administrator Astik Kumar Pandey has warned that citizens aged above 45 years would face action if they failed to take the vaccine against Covid-19 by April 30. “Traders in this age group foun d to have not taken the vaccine would be prohibited from opening their shops next month, when the restrictions are likely to be relaxed,” said Pandey in his public address through Facebook live on Sunday evening. Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan had recently said, ‘no vaccine, no pay’ to healthcare and front line workers, triggering a debate as the Union government has already made it clear that vaccination is voluntary. Pandey’s comment too sparked a debate. Pandey said the target beneficiaries should not come on the streets if they fail to take the vaccine. “The AMC has implemented a ‘mega vaccination mission’ and all target groups should take the shots at the earliest,” he said. The AMC administrator, who had recently tested positive for Covid-19 despite taking the second dose of the vaccine on March 12, said the recovery from the disease was smooth and quick for him and that vaccination is important for all. When contacted by TOI, Pandey said, “All who are eligible for vaccination but don’t take the jabs can sit at home and not come on the roads. Such citizens should not be allowed to pose a threat to the health security of society.” Asked about any legal framework for making vaccination a must, Pandey said the civic body was contemplating issuing a necessary resolution soon. Maharashtra chief secretary Sitaram Kunte downplayed the hype surrounding Pandey’s comment. “Vaccination is voluntary as directed by the Centre. Even if taking the vaccine is optional, it is advisable to undergo immunisation in personal as well as public interest,” he said. The AMC, which started focusing on traders, banking staff and industrial workers since last Monday as a part of its ongoing vaccination drive, had administered 1,69,510 doses till Sunday. The beneficiaries included 52,582 citizens in the age group of 45 to 59. A total of 46,801 citizens aged above 60 years have taken their first dose of vaccine against Covid-19, shows official data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/take-vaccine-or-face-action-amc-chief-warns-45-citizens/articleshow/82149049.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Ahmedabad||Exploding phone: Dealer in Surat told to pay Rs 27,000||AHMEDABAD: A consumer court has ordered a mobile shop owner in Surat to pay Rs 27,000 compensation to a trader who sustained injuries on his thigh after his cellphone battery exploded while it was in his pocket. The case involved Himanshubhai Patel (36), who had purchased a mobile phone of Oppo company from a shop named Havmor Mobile on Varachha Road in June 2016. On December 30, 2018 evening, the cellphone battery exploded. Patel had kept the phone inside the left pocket of his trousers. He sustained injury in his thigh, and was immediately rushed to a private hospital. Patel paid Rs 700 to the doctor towards consultancy charges, Rs 5,000 for dressing of the wound and Rs 2,000 for medicines. He sued the dealer and demanded Rs 5 lakh compensation for the damage he sustained including loss of business because he had to remain out of work for several days, he claimed in his complaint filed before the Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, Surat. The commission issued notice to the shop owner, but he did not appear. This led to an ex-parte hearing of the case. The complainant placed a certificate issued by Dr A L Savani showing that he had sustained injury and it mentioned that the injury was caused due to the battery explosion. After hearing Patel, the consumer court said that there was no complaint of manufacturing defect because the cellphone was used for more than two years before explosion took place in its battery. There was a six-month guarantee for the mobile battery and its charger. However, it remained an undisputed fact that the injury was caused because of the explosion in the battery. Moreover, in absence of any defence on part of the dealer, the complainant’s claim remained unchallenged. The commission, therefore, held that there was a defect in the cellphone and therefore the dealer was ordered to pay Rs 7,000 to Patel for medical treatment, and Rs 20,000 as compensation for the trouble caused to him. The amount has been ordered to be paid with 8% interest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/exploding-phone-dealer-told-to-pay-rs-27000/articleshow/82152800.cms||---

The cylinders will be filled on the way and will be deployed in hospitals through the state government,” said a source at the defence minister’s office. Experts said that a patient’s need for oxygen depends on individual SPO2 levels. One jumbo cylinder has 50 litre capacity which makes it last for around eight hours for a patient and can also be used to refill smaller cylinders. Meanwhile, DRDO has started work on setting up a makeshift Covid hospital at Awadh Shilpgram on Shaheed Path and the facility is likely to be ready within 10 days. Senior officials said on Monday that DRDO is focusing on setting up a makeshift hospital at Awadh Shilpgram first, instead of at all the three spots identified initially for Covid facilities in the city. “Work has started at Awadh Shilpgram and there will be 450 beds, including 150 ICU beds and 300 general isolation beds,” said a senior DRDO official from Delhi. DRDO, which started its makeshift Covid hospital in Delhi on Monday, had initially said that it would set up temporary hospitals at Haj House and Golden Blossoms Resort also, besides the one at Awadh Shilpgram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rajnath-sends-jumbo-oxygen-cylinders-to-tide-over-crisis/articleshow/82152819.cms||Yusra Husain

The judges will see that the officers swear on their statements online. The Gujarat high court closed all courtrooms in lower courts from Monday and ordered the judicial work to be continued through virtual mode only. On Monday, the principal sessions judge at the city sessions court, Shubhada Baxi, issued a circular stating that henceforth the investigating officers will have to scan and send soft copy of their affidavits. The officer will have to swear on their statements online before the judge. According to public prosecutor Sudhir Brahmbhatt, such an arrangement has been made for the first time and he has conveyed to all police stations to follow these instructions. As the high court has ordered closure of courtrooms until further notice, the principal judge has ordered advocates not to bring litigants to court even if notices were issued to them earlier. The circular also made it clear that the courts will not pass any adverse order against any litigant in case of their absence during the proceedings. The courts had switched to the virtual mode of hearing following the Covid-triggered lockdown in March last year. The high court permitted courtrooms in Ahmedabad city to open and resume physical functioning in March. A month later, the courtrooms have been closed once again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cops-to-swear-on-affidavits-online-before-judges/articleshow/82152838.cms||---

Prasad’s family reached Chennai by bus from Dindigul where he was a daily wage labourer in a plywood-making unit. However, he was worried to see anxious guest workers like him slowly and steadily congregating at the railway station. Fearful of a repeat of the exodus last year, guest workers are crowding railway stations and making inquiries on trains to their destinations. On Sunday, the Tamil Nadu government had put in place restrictions after Covid-19 cases breached the 10,000 mark for the first time. The restrictions have caused panic among hundreds of guest workers. “We have been adhering to the SOPs that are in place since last summer. We have advised employers to take care of the workforce,” said a senior IAS officer in the department of labour. “I want to see my family reach home (native village) before things turn unpleasant,” said Prasad who was worried about getting train tickets on time and a safe journey amid the Covid-19 surge due to the second wave of the pandemic. A group of youth from Odisha recalled their experience last summer and said they were “chased like dogs and treated badly” when they tried to escape the lockdown. “We don’t want that to happen this time,” said Vidhuth in not-so-fluent Tamil. They sell carpets for a living in Chennai. A few yards away, Shivraj and his extended family took refuge beneath a tree. It has literally turned their home for the past three days. “We are trying to book tatkal tickets for 10 of our family members, barring five of our children. Only four tickets were confirmed. Without a confirmed ticket, no one is let into the station. I don’t know what to do,” said Shivaraj of Bihar’s Bhagalpur district. He along with his brother and father were selling terracotta dolls in and around Tambaram to eke out a living. Though the situation was grim in their state, he said they had “no other choice”. Gopal, a porter in the railway station, said they had been seeing an unusual crowd in the past three days. “We can see hundreds of youngsters and women with children sitting with their belongings, packed and waiting restlessly to get tickets to their destination,” said the young porter pointing to the long queue at the tatkal counter, while a Southern Railway official said the trains bound to north and northeastern states were going packed. They were allowing passengers with confirmed tickets into the station. A small section of guest workers from MSMEs in Coimbatore and garment sectors in Tirupur have begun leaving TN in the wake of the uncertain situation. The departure began a week ago and over the past two days, there has been a marginal increase in the number of guest workers leaving Coimbatore. However, the vast majority of guest workers in both cities have decided to wait and watch as they had returned only three months ago after almost six months in their hometowns. As of now, there has been no sign of reverse migration from the central part of TN, particularly Karur, Trichy and Pudukottai districts that have a significant number of guest workers. A similar situation prevailed in Madurai and other southern districts.

---||Delhi||RWAs struggle to keep house workers out||New Delhi: Though domestic workers haven’t been exempted from the weeklong lockdown in the city, many residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) on Tuesday found it difficult to keep them out as many people called them to work. At places, residents even had arguments with security guards for stopping domestic workers from entering the complex. “Despite orders, we had several people, including domestic and construction workers, gathering outside the entry gate on Tuesday morning. Our guards informed the residents that individual movement of people was prohibited, but in vain. We also saw people calling labourers for construction work, which was surprising. Eventually, we had to call the local police and the subdivisioanl magistrate for help,” said M K Gupta, RWA president of GK-I S block. Hoping that things would improve in the coming days, Gupta added, “We have placed sanitisers, thermal scanning machines and soaps for the visitors.” Unlike last year, this time RWAs are more careful about the restrictions. A few of them are playing safe and requesting residents to only avoid calling outsiders, if not essential for certain reasons. “People are aware about the deteriorating circumstances in the city and the restrictions imposed by the government. We have requested them to provide full support to the authorities in making this curfew a success. Thankfully, 80-90% people have supported us and did not call any outsider,” said Ruby Makhija, secretary of Navjiwan Vihar RWA. Vinod K Nair, president of Pocket D SFS flats RWA in Mayur Vihar-III, alleged that entry of domestic workers in the societies was possible only due to dilly-dallying attitude of the authorities. “If these people are managing to come till the entry gates despite the lockdown, we can’t stop them from entering. It will only lead to dispute among residents. However, many understand the situation and are not calling their help or cutting their payment,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rwas-struggle-to-keep-house-workers-out/articleshow/82169551.cms||Vibha Sharma

The judges wanted a reply for this from the state government in its next affidavit to be filed within 48 hours. The death figures in the districts are being fudged, the senior counsel charged. “We do not know the reasons for official apathy. But, we cannot remain as bystanders to the unfolding trauma. We want answers. What are the avenues the common people have in case an emergency strikes them,” he wondered. The health secretary told the court that the government had set up call centres to attend to people’s grievances. “Just a call to 104 and 108 is enough. They will guide the affected people. We have 49 Covid-19 isolation centres also,” he said. The judges pointed out that the direction given to the state government to form an advisory body had not been followed till now. “There is a need to appoint nodal officers to monitor the availability of beds in hospitals run by both private and public sectors,” they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/set-up-call-centres-to-help-people-govt/articleshow/82151914.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Up to the minister to act in sacrilege cases: Sidhu to Phoolka||Chandigarh: Reacting to former MLA H S Phoolka’s letter to him on the sacrilege issue, Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu on Monday said that it was for the state home minister to bring the guilty to book. In his reply, Sidhu also said that his change of portfolio and subsequent resignation from the cabinet happened after he had raised the sacrilege issue during campaigning for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in Bathinda. “As members of the legislative assembly, you and I raised the issue. I tried to bring out the facts in the House and even named the politicians accused in the case. Later, to put pressure on the government so that the probe is expedited, I even held a press conference and released CCTV footage of Kotkapura chowk from October 2015 that showed evidence of police firing at innocent people. I had demanded that an FIR be registered against the accused,” Sidhu stated in his letter. “For taking due action – registration of FIR, setting up of SIT, arrests etc — it is the home minister of the state who is directly responsible. During my stint as a cabinet minister for 27 months, I repeatedly raised the issues of sacrilege and drugs. During the Lok Sabha campaigning for Congress in 2019, I had demanded in a public meeting in Bathinda, that there should be justice in the sacrilege case at all cost. I had repeatedly said that those who gave orders for firing and took political decisions should be taken to task,” he said. “Because of this, my portfolio was changed in the cabinet and I resigned as I believe that no position is bigger than respect for the Guru… As an elected representative too, I am calling a spade a spade and demanding action against the accused,” he said. “Even by holding 10 special assembly sessions, FIR against the accused, to investigate and arrest the accused cannot happen. It is in the hands of the home minister and he can give these orders. People know what I have done so far and what I am doing,” he said, adding that Phoolka’s demand for a special session of the assembly will serve no purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/up-to-the-minister-to-act-in-sacrilege-cases-sidhu-to-phoolka/articleshow/82152885.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Jaipur||Chaos, confusion on Day 1 of ‘Discipline Fortnight’||Jaipur: Day One of the extended curfew renamed as ‘Discipline Fortnight’ failed to keep people indoors across the city on Monday. Most of the shops were open and there was moderate traffic during the day. The long list of exemptions gave opportunity to citizens to come out in large numbers. While the rule said markets to remain closed with a rider that shops with essential commodities can function, people used this opportunity to come out. Most of the restaurants and eateries were open for home delivery and this made it difficult for police to control the crowd. Saurabh Choudhary, a resident of Vidhyadhar Nagar, moved to different parts of the city during the day. “I was stopped at several places by police but they allowed me to go after I cited buying medicine as a reason. Nobody tried to check if I had a valid prescription or not,” said Choudhary, who felt that the purpose of curfew cannot be achieved by this partial prohibition. Police denied leaving any loopholes in enforcing the guidelines of the government. “Since every second establishment was open in the city and traffic movement remained unrestricted. Every person heading out in the city cited some reason or the other to allow them to go,” police said. Police guarding checkposts were struggling to stop people from venturing out of their houses. “The most quoted reason was having an appointment with doctor, buying medicines, going to the bus station, seeing an ailing mother/father/brother. It seems that the entire city is ill. We understand that it is fake, but we have clear directions to be sensitive with everyone and not to escalate the argument,” said an SHO of a police station in the city. A heavy rush of migrants and students was seen at Sindhi Camp bus station as people boarded buses to Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and other parts of the state. The extended curfew has forced the migrants working as labourers in Jaipur to return to their native places. The Rajasthan State Transport Corporation (RSRTC) is running limited buses due to COVID 19 is adding to the woes of the migrants. The private bus operators playing extra buses from the evening to rush in the demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/chaos-confusion-on-day-1-of-discipline-fortnight/articleshow/82151899.cms||---

Cops working tirelessly to ensure strict implementation of curfew and restrictions in containment areas received personal appreciation from Tomar who also met locals while visiting narrow lanes of Mahidharpura and encouraged them to follow Covid-19 guidelines issued by the government.

Tomar to visit other areas of the city on a daily basis to examine police bandobast in different areas. “Police force is ensuring strict implementation of curfew for many months now. I went out to see the implementation and also to boost morale of cops who are working hard despite the risk of Covid-19,” Tomar told TOI. Police are also assisting teams of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) in taking legal actions against those found flaunting rules of home quarantine. Police are arresting these individuals if found violating rules. “Through foot patrolling police can stay connected to people who are locked inside the house during curfew.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Traffic snarls greet cops as motorists flout norms||JAIPUR: The first day of the fortnight-long curfew that began on Monday turned out to be bemusing one for the cops manning the barricades placed on city roads to check if people were violating the guidelines. They did not expect that so many vehicles, including cars, buses, auto rickshaws and wheels of every other variety would turn up on the roads. As they stuck to the task of verifying the purpose of visit of the people, the traffic snarls kept growing. What ensued is an irony of sorts of the curfew, traffic jams and snarls having hundreds of vehicles witnessed on Tonk Road, Badi Chaupar and other places. As it turned out, there were not many violators and the cops had to give passage to all vehicles barring a couple of isolated cases, who were unfortunate to not have any identity cards. A cop said privately that the guidelines were very citizen-centric and they had to allow people who were even going to buy vegetables from the Lal Kothi Sabji Mandi. Commenting on the traffic in the city, Rahul Prakash, additional commissioner of police, Jaipur police commissionerate, said, “Citizens are coming up with reasons which are permitted in the rules. Since most of the things are permitted or open in the city, including transport, we are maintaining a balance by moderating it.” But as the snarls got longer, cops realized that it was not making a good optic of the curfew and there were not many who were actually breaking any rules. After an hour or so, the barricades were removed at some places, including Tonk Road, to ease the traffic flow and along with that the verification process was also abandoned. But the curfew seems to have got what the cops failed earlier, of not having crowds, as the markets, malls, and most shops remained shut.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/traffic-snarls-greet-cops-as-motorists-flout-norms/articleshow/82151919.cms||---

Police nabbed the brother of a pradhan candidate with the 'paneer'. Sources said that the cops had received a tip-off that one Deep Chand - a candidate for the post of village pradhan in Chakori village - was distributing cottage cheese to lure voters.

---||Delhi||6-day lockdown gives Delhiites alcohol rush||New Delhi: Among the hundreds outside a liquor store in Shivpuri, Geeta Colony, an elderly woman caught everyone’s eye. “The Covid vaccine will make no difference, but alcohol will,” the senior citizen declared. “All those queued up here will not be affected by the pandemic because they all drink. I will buy a full bottle plus two quarter bottles. The government is right in imposing the lockdown, but it should keep the liquor stores open.” To the delight of the media people, she added, “I have been drinking for 35 years and haven’t felt the need to go to a doctor. My health secret is drinking every day.” As the news of the weeklong lockdown spread, liquor shops were the first to see a rush. At some vends, people fought with each other to be the first to get their hand on a bottle. Obviously, the memories of last year, when alcohol had to be purchased at a premium during the lockdown, impelled the tipplers into lining up outside the liquor stores on Monday. In some markets, the queues extended for over 500 metres. Social distancing was all but invisible despite the store owners constantly coaxing people to maintain a distance from each other. At Khan Market, people standing in the lengthy queue fought with each other to reach the counter. “I have been standing here for an hour and have come to pick up my stock,” said a 30-year-old man. “They have announced the lockdown and with the pay cuts we have suffered, it will be difficult to cough up double the price for liquor.”Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced a six-day lockdown from 10pm on Monday till 5am on April 26, which he said was necessary to deal with the drastic rise in Covid-19 cases, which had left the city's health system stretched to its limit. An association of liquor companies, meanwhile, came out with a statement urging Delhi government to allow home delivery of alcoholic beverages in the city on the lines of Maharashtra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/6-day-lockdown-gives-delhiites-alcohol-rush/articleshow/82151929.cms||---

---||Mumbai||With 18+, Mumbai’s vax target now ‘80 lakh people’||MUMBAI: The decision to “open up” the Covid-19 vaccination drive from May 1 for people between 18 and 45 years of age has raised more questions than comfort. Queries are being raised about the healthcare infrastructure’s ability to scale up adequately to vaccinate almost 70% of the population, the pricing mechanism and monitoring of adverse event following inoculation (AEFI) if vaccines are sold directly to hospitals, doctors or consumers. In Maharashtra, where healthcare experts and local politicians had suggested universal vaccination over a month ago, the “delayed” announcement has produced a mixed reaction. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, an advisor to the state government, said the Centre’s decision has come a tad too late since Maharashtra is already in the eye of the storm. “But it’s better late than never. We have been pleading with the Centre for at least one-and-a-half months to open vaccination for those above 18 years. In the second wave, the young are affected and quite severely in many cases,” he said. The size of the population to be vaccinated is huge, raising concerns about stockouts. In Mumbai, BMC’s target for vaccination increases to 80 lakh recipients over the age of 18 years, said BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. The corresponding number across the state would be 8.5 crore. “If we are not able to meet the vaccine demand of the 45-plus age-group, how will we manage the demand for the extended population?” asked TISS faculty and NGO Jan Swasthya Abhiyan’s co-convenor Brinelle D’souza. Health researcher Ravi Duggal said if this “opening up” is not accompanied by substantially increased production of vaccines, it will only add to the chaos. “The only way vaccine production can be increased is by invoking compulsory licensing for two existing vaccines by roping in as many pharma companies who have capacity to produce vaccines, and once this happens the procurement should be decentralized,” said Duggal. The Centre’s relaxation could mean about 65% of Maharashtra’s 12.5 crore population could get vaccinated. “It will roughly be about 8.5 crore people,” Duggal added. The current target was around 3 crore, including healthcare workers. Salunkhe said the state has to rope in more private clinics and hospitals. Duggal said planning the supply chain and logistics in a timely manner could be the challenge now. CM Uddhav Thackeray said in a statement, “I had some days ago requested PM Narendra Modi to decide on vaccinating all those aged above 25. The Central government today took a positive step on it declaring to administer the vaccine to all aged above 18 and thought about my demand.

This is even as the district authorities are conducting awareness drives to ensure that people practice social distancing and wear face masks at all times. “Meerut recorded as many as 741 cases on Sunday. This accounts for a 10% positivity rate as 7,905 samples were tested on this day. The positivity rate graph is slowly increasing in the district,” a health department report said. Notably, in the past week, the number of Covid-19 cases in Meerut has gone up considerably. It has broken all earlier records with 741 cases on Sunday, 716 cases on Saturday and 551 cases on Friday - each day surpassed the previous day’s figure. Meanwhile, a purported video of a Covid-19 positive patient lying on the floor of a ward went viral on social media highlighting the difficult state of affairs inside Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial (LLRM) Medical College. Dr Gyanendra Kumar, principal, said, “The video has come to our notice. It was found that the patient was willingly lying on the floor.

Most hospitals in Uttar Pradesh are facing a plasma crunch. After recovering, Covid-19 patients are shying away from donating plasma, said a senior health official. Convalescent plasma therapy is a procedure that is used to treat severe Covid-19 patients who are injected with the plasma of a cured patient to boost his immunity. Just how grim the situation is can be gauged in Meerut, where just three units of plasma were left on Monday at the plasma bank of Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial (LLRM) Medical College, according to sources. A list of 725 cured people who could donate their plasma was made by LLRM. However, till date only 35 have donated their plasma. Dr Monika Rathi, in-charge, blood bank, LLRM Medical College, said, “While a list of 725 people was made, not all are eligible to donate plasma. For instance, women who have conceived at least once cannot donate nor can people with low haemoglobin count or anaemia. In fact, there are cases wherein people approach us after six months for plasma donation, which is too late as they do not have any antibodies by that time.” All those patients who have recovered can donate plasma after four weeks of getting cured or latest within five months providing they are physically fit. Brigadier (retd) Dr RK Gupta, director, Government Institute of Medical Sciences that has Noida’s only government plasma bank, said, “Since May 2020, we have had 510 plasma donors and it was transfused into 780 patients. The number is even lower because the cases weren’t as high earlier.” Dr RP Singh, chief medical superintendent of SRMS Medical College in Bareilly said, “Of the 1,665 patients who recovered so far, only 105 have turned up for plasma donation. We are trying to make people aware that donating plasma can save someone’s life.” Presenting a bleak scenario, Dr RN Nayar, nodal officer, Covid treatment, Bijnor, said appeals to donate plasma have fallen on deaf ears. Shahjahanpur’s district immunization officer Dr Laxman Singh said, “Not a single recovered patient has approached us to donate plasma since last year.” Districts like Baghpat do not even have any plasma storage facility. Now, with Covid-19 cases soaring, the health authorities there have been jolted into making a plan to set up a plasma bank and begin connecting with patients who recovered from the infection. The medical fraternity in Agra had a different take on the matter. Chief medical officer of Agra district, Dr RC Pandey, said, ‘”The ICMR suggests that plasma therapy did not help in treating Covid-19 patients. It is not part of the standard treatment protocol. However, it's the doctors' discretion to decide what is best for the patient. In case a doctor recommends plasma therapy, we provide a list of cured donors to the family of the patient.” Health department officials in Agra said plasma of cured Covid-19 patient is not available at the government blood bank and in the past one month, no donar has come to donate plasma.

Then, Goa were brought back to earth as the Iranian champions registered a convincing 2-1 win in a group E clash at the Nehru stadium in Fatorda on Tuesday. Persepolis were stunned when captain Edu Bedia headed home Goa’s opening goal, the first for the club at this level and in this competition. It was the 14th minute. But while Goa celebrated wildly with club president Akshay Tandon jumping off his chair, the excitement expectedly didn’t last long. Persepolis hit back four minutes later with Mahdi Torabi converting a penalty to draw level. In the 24th minute, normalcy was restored as the Iran Pro League winners surged ahead with captain Jalal Hosseini’s header giving no chance to goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh. Despite draws against stronger opponents like Al Rayyan and Al Wahda in the two previous games, the gulf in difference between the debutants and last year’s finalists was just too much. Persepolis were much stronger. They moved the ball quickly, didn’t provide Goa with any breathing space and their two strikers – Shahriyar Moghanloo and Isa Alkasir – were ready to pounce on almost everything. Goa tried to disturb them with a five-man midfield, Adil Khan being slotted there in place of striker Ishan Pandita. That didn’t work. Whatever trap Juan Ferrando laid, Persepolis found a way to beat that. Goa scored the first goal of this campaign against a team who won both their previous games. It came from a set-piece after Jorge Ortiz had done well to win a freekick on the right. Brandon Fernandes whipped it inside the heart of Persepolis defence and Edu did the rest with a smart, glancing header. Two minutes later, Goa could have made it 2-0. Edu and Brandon combined again; this time the captain laid the ball in Brandon’s path, who struck the ball cleanly from close, but goalkeeper Hamed Lak made a terrific diving save. What if it was 2-0? We would never know. Nobody had any doubt, though, that Persepolis would pour forward in search of the equaliser. They got it soon enough. Alkasir drew a foul from James Donachie inside the box and won a penalty which Torabi converted in the 18th minute. Captain Hosseini then jumped highest to nod home his team’s second goal and Persepolis never looked troubled again. Persepolis, in fact, had chances to score more but Goa defended resolutely with two blocks of four and five. Dheeraj, too, continued to impress, saving a first-half penalty from Hossein Kanani. The teams now meet again in the next clash on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/persepolis-show-class-hand-fc-goa-first-defeat-in-acl/articleshow/82169591.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

On one hand, Covid patients in Aurangabad are struggling to get oxygen, while on the other hand, the district administration is allowing bulk export of the gas to other cities,” he told the media after attending a review meeting with the district administration on Monday. Aurangabad district administration last week had acquired a private oxygen manufacturing plant from Chitegaon industrial area in the wake of the mismatch between demand and supply of oxygen. As per the official record, the oxygen demand for Covid facilities was around 59 metric tonne last week. In a meeting of public representatives organised by the district administration, Jaleel also demanded the release of official notification to declare help avenues for weaker sections during the stringent Covid related restrictions. “Even if the restrictions have been imposed in the name of controlling the Covid spread, the disadvantaged groups have no idea how to access the help declared by the government. ‘Break the chain’ order of the government is silent on such help avenues,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/mp-opposes-export-of-o2-to-other-cities/articleshow/82149054.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||IMA Maharashtra seeks vaccination ‘for all & by all’||Aurangabad: Stressing on the need for mass vaccination against Covid, the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Maharashtra, has demanded that all those who are desirous, irrespective of age group, should be vaccinated.In a memorandum submitted to the state government, IMA also said that all interested health institutions — instead of the limited number of facilities currently allowed — should be roped in to make the current vaccination programme “for all and by all”.The IMA said the private labs that do not have NABL accreditation should be allowed to carry out the RT-PCR tests to enable large-scale testing. “Improved Covid testing, offering effective treatment and raising public awareness on Covid-appropriate behaviour are being used as a three-pronged strategy by the government in its fight against Covid-19. The policy of ‘vaccination for all and by all’ can give an edge to official effort,” IMA state president Ramkrishna Londhe said.To push for the IMA stand, Londhe said doctors have had experience in execution of mass immunization programmes including those aimed at eradication of polio and smallpox.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan has recently said it was not scientifically necessary to vaccinate every person. “Every vaccine doesn’t require universal immunization and all the priority groups that are getting the vaccines now — like healthcare workers, senior citizens and people aged between 45 and 59 years — will be extended in the coming days. All these are based on experts’ opinion,” he said replying to a question in the Lok Sabha.Meanwhile, the IMA, in its plea to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, demanded insurance cover for all its doctor members and associated healthcare workers. “As many as 17,975 doctor members of IMA have contracted Covid so far and 168 have succumbed to the disease while engaged in Covid-19 duty. The government should offer an insurance shield to the healthcare staff,” IMA secretary Dr Pankaj Bandarkar said.Seeking conscious and organized efforts to keep the morale of doctors intact, the IMA has sought autonomy and minimal interference from local authorities while treating Covid-19 patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/ima-maharashtra-seeks-vaccination-for-all-by-all/articleshow/82149081.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi couple sent to jail for misbehaving with cops, violating Covid norms||NEW DELHI: A couple who had allegedly misbehaved with policemen in central Delhi’s Daryaganj was sent to jail on Monday after a court dismissed their bail application. The couple has been booked for offences under IPC pertaining to obstructing and attacking policemen apart from lockdown and mask violation offences under the DDMA Act. The couple, identified as Pankaj and Abha from Patel Nagar, had got into a brawl with the police officers on Sunday after being flagged down for not following Covid-appropriate behaviour. During interrogation, the couple blamed each other for their outbursts. The man claimed they had been fighting in the car as she refused to wear a mask or let him wear one. He swore to never repeat his act. The woman has blamed the husband and said she was in a bad mood due to the fight and took it out on the policemen. The woman was arrested on Monday, while the man was arrested Sunday. “An incident was reported from Dilli Gate, Daryaganj yesterday where a man and a woman in a car were moving during curfew hours and police personnel deployed on duty asked them to stop and get their movement pass checked. Not only could they not show any movement pass but neither of them was wearing any mask,” deputy commissioner of police (Central) Jasmeet Singh stated. On being pointed out that they needed to wear masks as per government order, the woman and the man came out of the vehicle and challenged the policemen as to how they could dare to stop their car. They started misbehaving, hurling abuses and provoking the policemen on duty, police said in a statement. “However, despite such aggressive and provocative behavior, the policemen remained patient. The two persons by violating the curfew order and Covid protocol, and moreover, by misbehaving with policemen on duty in the manner they did, created grounds for a criminal case to be registered against them,” the DCP added. Delhi Police has appealed to citizens to not violate Covid guidelines and lawful directions. “Law breakers shall be firmly dealt with. The public is hereby requested to co-operate and obey the lawful directions of the police officials to prevent the spread of coronavirus pandemic,” PRO Chinmoy Biswal said.

The free oxygen comes with kits that can be fitted at home for Covid-19 patients whose oxygen saturation level is low. Initiated by NGO Red Crescent Society of India, oxygen cylinders are being provided by several mosques in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, including the city, Mumbra, Mira Road, Kalyan and Bhiwandi. “Since not all Covid-19 patients are getting beds in hospitals and many are being treated at home, we thought of making oxygen available to those who need it. It is being provided for free to people, irrespective of religion, caste or creed. This is our united fight against the pandemic and we thought of doing our bit to help the needy,” said Arshad Siddiqui, chairman, Red Crescent Society of India. Siddiqui said the demand is increasing and his NGO may not be able to meet it. When asked why he chose to involve the mosques in this work, he said they should not be used only to pray five times a day. “It is God’s house, a sacred place, and we feel a good initiative should start from a sacred place. We are getting requests from all communities,” said Siddiqui whose NGO had earlier worked for victims of earthquakes, the tsunami and refugee camps of Rohingyas in Bangladesh. Activist Dr Azimuddin who is volunteering in the arrangement of oxygen for patients getting treated at home, said so far 1,000 cylinders have been distributed. “Many people are dying because they are not getting oxygen in time. I have seen patients being sent back from different hospitals due to the shortage of oxygen. If there is adequate supply of oxygen, many lives can be saved,” he said. Dr Azimuddin added more mosques would be roped in, provided the factory does not stop the supply. Hospitals are being preferred as far as the supply of oxygen is concerned. But it is also important oxygen is made available to NGOs trying to ameliorate people’s misery, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mosques-offer-free-oxygen-cylinders-in-mumbai-metropolitan-region/articleshow/82149881.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Rise in cases of post-Covid infection among children||MUMBAI: A six-year-old boy landed up in the casualty ward of Parel-based Wadia Hospital two weeks ago and collapsed almost immediately. Doctors, now aware of the signs of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), swiftly gave him cardiac and adrenaline support and saved his life. A serious inflammatory illness that strikes children weeks after they have been exposed to Covid-19, the MIS-C was first reported by doctors in the US and UK last year. With the second wave, cases of MIS-C are once again seen in paediatric departments. Children are also showing some signs typically seen in Kawasaki disease such as red eyes, swollen hands and feet, rashes, red cracked lips. The presentation has not changed in the second wave, doctors said, but parents must stay vigilant. Dr Shakuntala Prabhu, medical director of Wadia, said that the six-year-old boy had come with inflammation of the heart which has been seen in MIS-C cases. “In this syndrome, Covid triggers a dysregulated immune reaction, where not just the virus but even the organs are under attack. In the last one month, we have seen five confirmed cases of MIS-C,” said Prabhu, adding that all could be detected and treated on time. MIS-C also affects children who were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Doctors at SRCC Children’s Hospital in Mahalaxmi have seen four cases of MIS-C, also called the paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome. Dr Soonu Udani, director, critical care said that all four are currently hospitalised. “A few of them came in shock and with cardiac involvement, but we have been able to treat them. They are coming after 3-4 days of fever, red eyes, rashes and cracked lips,” she said. Paediatrician Dr Nitin Shah said that he has seen around five cases of MIS-C so far, but some didn’t require hospitalisation. “But, we have to be prepared to see more cases in the coming weeks as MIS-C is essentially a post Covid infection. It is seen 2-5 weeks after the child may have been exposed,” he said. The second wave has seen children getting equally affected and some with the serious disease too. In Maharashtra, over one lakh children have tested positive so far since last March. According to infectious disease expert Dr Tanu Singhal, who consults with Kokilaben Ambani Hospital, a bigger worry than MIS-C is children coming with a more severe Covid infection. “There are children and adolescents coming with severe lung involvement and requiring remdesivir. In some, the fever is not resolving till the seventh or eighth day, while some are developing pneumonia,” she said, adding that in the first wave, children were largely asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Dr Singhal has seen four cases of MIS-C in the past few weeks. Dr Udani said that the moment a child starts feeling dizzy, disoriented or breathless, they should be rushed to the nearest hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rise-in-cases-of-post-covid-infection-among-children/articleshow/82151966.cms||Sumitra Debroy

But this did not include departmental stores or malls”, he said.Dairy shops and vegetable and fruit carts will be allowed to operate from 5pm to 7pm.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra, Mumbai see dip in cases with fewer tests on weekend||MUMBAI: With fewer Covid-19 tests conducted over the weekend, Maharashtra and Mumbai reported a dip in daily detections. The state added 58,924 cases and 351 fatalities on Monday, pushing the total caseload to 38.9 lakh and toll to 60,824. A total of 2.2 lakh tests were conducted on Sunday as against the state’s highest-ever case tally of 68,637 from 2.7 lakh tests done on Saturday (test results take around 24 hours), according to the state government’s daily update. In Mumbai, 7,381 cases were detected from 36,556 tests done on Sunday. On weekdays, the city conducts an average 45,000 tests and for the last week, daily cases have hovered over 8,000-9,000. While Maharashtra reported a dip in deaths, Mumbai reported a slight increase. As many as 58 deaths were reported in the city on Monday, more than triple the toll on April 1 (18). According to BMC’s Covid data, 209 patients died in March, but the number rose to 702 between April 1 and 19. Although Covid cases have plateaued in the city, doctors said deaths could increase in the next week as fatalities peak a fortnight after cases peak. Of the 351 deaths in the state, nearly 30%—103—were reported from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “Every death is unfortunate, but if we see the overall picture, the daily death rate is still under 0.6. Even our overall case fatality rate, which was 5 in October-November 2020 has dropped to 2.1,” said Kakani. The city’s death rate due to Covid-19 in this month is lower than the national average, he added. The big problem before the BMC is patients’ preference for private beds. “The BMC has some vacant beds, but there aren’t any vacant beds in the private sector. We don’t have a shortage of remdesivir either, but relatives of patients in private hospitals are running around for the medication,’’ Kakani said. The BMC cannot share remdesivir with the private sector because of its own patient load. Considering that the daily cases have jumped from around 500 daily in late February to 8,000 daily now, there is a scarcity of beds in the city. In BMC-run Nair Hospital, for instance, there were less than 350 patients in March end, but the inpatients has almost doubled since. “We have quite a few moderately to severe patients. Almost 60 patients are pregnant women and 25 children with Covid are in the NICU,” said dean Dr Ramesh Bharmal. According to the district update, Nagpur added its highest ever death toll on Monday with 113 deaths, of which 75 were from the city. Most of these deaths were not included in the state update on Monday and are likely to be reflected on Tuesday. On Monday, MMR added 15,623 cases taking the total tally to 12.1 lakh. Kalyan-Dombivli had higher number of discharges than new cases as 2,024 patients recovered while 1,551 new cases were reported. The tally here has reached 1,07,584 and total toll 1,329.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-mumbai-see-dip-in-cases-with-fewer-tests-on-weekend/articleshow/82151994.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Ahmedabad||‘5.44L remdesivir vials ordered in April, got 2L in the last week’||Ahmedabad: The state government on Monday told the Gujarat high court that it placed orders for the procurement of 5.44 lakh vials of remdesivir between April 1 and 18, but it is getting about 20,000 vials daily with great difficulty. After the high court took the government to task over medicine shortage and told it to resolve the problem, the government said that since April 13, it has received 2,05,431 vials. It said that after keeping minimum stock for emergency, all the vials are utilized. They are distributed on priority basis, first among government hospitals and then at private hospitals. The government told the HC that after a ban on remdesivir exports, Gujarat got 55,000 more vials. The government said it has decided to set up control rooms and helplines in each district to monitor distribution of remdesivir. These facilities will start soon. The government has also stated that besides cracking down on black marketers, its task force committee has appealed to doctors and people at large to not insist on remdesivir use as it is not a life-saving drug for Covid-19 patients. However, it cannot procure enough to address the anxiety of people with the increased use of the medicine over the past few days. The principal health secretary has stated on affidavit that the administration of remdesivir has been prescribed for patients who test Covid-19 positive not only with the RT-PCR test, but also with the Rapid Antigen Test and CT scan. However, the circular attached to substantiate these claims only placed a price cap on CT scans at private facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/5-44l-remdesivir-vials-ordered-in-april-got-2l-in-the-last-week/articleshow/82153110.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad admin’s plan to make vaccination mandatory finds takers||Aurangabad: The Aurangabad civic administration’s plan to invoke action against people refusing Covid vaccination has evoked immediate reactions with many stakeholders saying the official push for the immunization programme is in larger public interest.Shobha Thorat, a senior citizen, said: “Some target beneficiaries are still reluctant to take the Covid vaccine for reasons best known to them. The civic administration, to boost vaccine cioverage, has given an ultimatum. I feel this is essential.”AMC administrator Astik Kumar Pandey said the civic body has powers to take such a step. He cited the move to levy a Rs 500 fine on people not wearing face masks. Abhay Hanchanal, the president of the Marathwada Association of Small Scale Industries and Agriculture (Massia), said citizens should understand and appreciate the civic authorities' efforts. “The civic administration’s stand can be perceived as a tactic to put pressure on beneficiaries to get vaccinated as soon as possible. At our end, we are promoting the vaccination drive among the industries. The vaccine is beneficial for an individual, his/her family and even the community,” he said.Vijay Jaiswal, the vice-president of the local traders’ body, said he was not aware that vaccination against Covid-19 was optional. “Vaccination is the only weapon available against Covid-19. We are promoting it among our community members. In fact, we have joined hands with the civic body to carry out the vaccination drive among the traders. Having said that, we hope the AMC will not take any extreme step that will affect our business or the economy at large,” he said. Yogesh Pawar, a private professional, said the municipal corporation should also focus on health workers and frontline workers. “Although vaccination for these groups began relatively early, the coverage is still poor. The civic administration should hold these categories to the same standards if it decides on punishing the commoners for not taking the shots,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-admins-plan-to-make-vaccination-mandatory-finds-takers/articleshow/82149084.cms||---

According to the Airport Authority of India (AAI), the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security has approved the application of AAI Rajkot to start cargo service. The passenger aircraft that don’t get sufficient passengers can fill the income gap by handling cargo. Digant Borah, Rajkot airport director said, “Two airlines are ready to start air cargo service and third airline operating from Rajkot has also shown interest. This is going to boost trade and industry in the Saurashtra region.”About 10 passenger flights currently operate from Rajkot airport. The destinations of these flights include Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bangaluru. These passenger aircraft have permission to carry limited cargo. But if the number of passengers are less, the carrier is allowed to can carry more cargo to compensate for loss of income for lack of passengers.Saurashtra is home of several key industries like Rajkot’s imitation jewellery and gold jewellery making, Morbi’s ceramic industry and brass industry of Jamnagar. The traders and manufacturers can now send samples to the customers using air cargo service. The courier services operators can also use the cargo service for faster delivery. According to sources, the airlines which started operation recently from Rajkot airport had surveyed about the cargo service and found a potential market in Saurashtra region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/rajkot-airport-gets-nod-for-air-cargo-service/articleshow/82151987.cms||---

With the mortality rate on a steady rise, a couple of corporate-styled funeral services’ firms – apart from local pandits and touts – are seen rolling out special packages on last rites, charging anywhere between Rs 30,000 and Rs 35,000 per ceremony. One of these companies – assuring end-to-end service across seven Indian cities – even has a complete customer support team in place at its headquarters, along with on-ground managers in every city, to handle its ‘orders’. Live updates: Coronavirus“We will conduct the entire procedure for you – from picking up the body to arranging a vehicle, booking a slot at the crematorium (in Bansilalpet), organising a pandit and even getting the material required for the rites,” said Sampath Bangaram, city manager of the Bengaluru-based Anthyesti Funeral Services with offices in Chennai, Delhi, Jaipur among others. The package rate for Hyderabad: Rs 32,000. Coronavirus: Complete coverageMuch like many other e-commerce platforms, here too the ‘customer’ is first directed to the firm’s hotline number for registration. Then, based on location, he/she is patched a call with the city coordinator.

It prides itself on offering ‘funeral services at your doorstep’ and has a two different – gold and basic – packages listed on its website. The former, predictably, promises a more elaborate cremation. While the executive was hesitant to share too many details over telephone when TOI called posing as a client, he said: “We are charging Rs 30,000 for Covid patients... it’s a risky job and getting slots at cremation sites is very difficult with the rush.” On being probed about the packages he added: “Please send us your location, our executive will come there and give you details.” Read AlsoSoaring cost of cremation singes families of deadVARANASI/MEERUT: The crackle of burning pyres, like the hiss of a giant serpent, feeds the smoke that is bellowing from Varanasi’s Harishchandra Ghat, an old cremation ground on Ganga’s banks.

At least 27 migrant workers were hurt in the accident near the Hyderabad airport when the lorry overturned. It was carrying 33 migrant brick kiln workers belonging to Odisha and Chhattisgarh. Cyberabad police on Monday said that the car was driven by a Madhapur police constable, identified as Giri Prasad, who is suspected to be drunk, accompanied by home guard Sangameshwar and a civilian Mallesh. “The trio on Sunday morning went to Yadagirigutta and allegedly consumed liquor. Later while returning, enroute too they stopped their car and again consumed liquor in the afternoon,” said a police officer probing the case. The lorry driver told cops that he lost control over the vehicle around 5.,30 pm, but he had no choice as the car driven by the constable was coming straight at him. Immediately after the accident, Giri Prasad and the other two fled from the location. A few hours later, Sangameshwar and Mallesh surrendered and tested positive for alcohol way above permissible levels in a breath analyzer test. Around 4 am on Monday, Giri Prasad surrendered before the police and was taken into custody by the airport police. “Due to the time lag, when he was made to undergo a breath analyzing test, the digital equipment showed negative. However, the other two accused confessed that Giri Prasad too consumed alcohol, so his blood sample was collected and sent for medical examination,” said an officer. Deputy commissioner of police (Shamshabad Zone) N Prakash Reddy said that as of now Giri Prasad has been booked under section 304 A (negligence causing death) of IPC and after receiving the medical report, if it is proved that Giri’s blood sample had alcohol, charges will then be alerted to 304 II (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of IPC. The lorry driver was booked for illegally carrying dozens of people in the goods vehicle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-drunk-cop-at-the-wheel-may-have-caused-accident-toll-mounts-to-7/articleshow/82151990.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Vaccination numbers see a steady decrease in city||Ahmedabad: The vaccination drive is taking a serious hit in the wake of rising Covid numbers. The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) is also facing shortage of staff to conduct vaccination drives. “Most centres face serious challenges of staff shortage. Nearly 19% to 20% staff in fa ew zones are not reporting to the testing or vaccination centres since they have contracted Covid or someone in their family has reportedly taken ill,” said a senior AMC official under condition of anonymity. The Covid vaccination drive since April 10 has seen more than 1.5 lakh people being vaccinated above the age of 45 years. But the number of those taking the shot has been steadily declining. On April 10 it was 26,800 for the day but by April 19, that number came down to 13,600. A large drop was seen in the above 45 years group as well. If the AMC vaccinated 16,500 individuals on April 10, only half of that number, 5,300, turned up for vaccination on Monday. Similarly, in the senior citizen’s group of above 60 years, the number steadily dropped from 7,800 on April 10 to 5,800 on Monday. At the same time, there has been a steady rise in the number of frontline and health workers taking vaccine shots. “We have covered a large part of the 11 lakh people in the city above 45 years age in the vaccination drive. That is why we are witnessing a lower turnout now. But we also admit that since most of the staff is being diverted for testing, our vaccination drive has taken a hit,” said a senior AMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vaccination-numbers-see-a-steady-decrease-in-city/articleshow/82153107.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Man who helps immerse ashes of dead in Haridwar||JAIPUR: Thirty years ago, Goverdhan Das Keswani had to borrow money for his mother’s shradh. That’s when he planned to visit Haridwar to immerse the ashes of those who could not afford it or were unable to go there for some other reasons. Few years after his voluntary retirement from the Food Corporation of India (FCI) in 2006, he started taking the ashes for immersion. Even during Covid, when many families are reluctant to visit Haridwar, Keswani, who now has a team of eight volunteers, visits Haridwar on behalf of those families. TOI on Monday met Kewasni at the Aadarsh Nagar crematorium where he was greeted by the caretaker who told him that ashes of relatives of many people who died of Covid were pending. “I lost my father when I was one year old. When I turned 30, I lost my mother. We were very poor during those days. While I had to borrow money from someone for the post-death rituals. I dreamt of doing this service for those who can’t afford it. In 2006. I took voluntary retirement and since then I have been visiting crematoriums and taking ashes of those whose families can’t afford it,” Keswani said. After Covid struck, there was scare among the masses. “Earlier, we were merely into taking ashes of relatives of those who can’t afford to visit Haridwar. But during Covid-19, we met many families who were reluctant to visit because of fear of getting infected. Thus, with my team of eight volunteers took the responsibility,” he added. “Log badi umeed se apnon ke asthi kalash dete hain (People with hope hand over the ashes of their deceased relatives),” he said. During lockdown, he had to visit police stations and other offices for passes. “Last year, when transport services were banned due to pandemic, we made passes and continued the services,” he said. He has also been awarded by the department of education for his noble deed. Asked if he is not scared of Covid, he said, “I am already 70 and I have blessings of almighty. Since I had dreamt of this work, I feel very satisfied.” His team members Dayal Das (65) and Surendra Kumar (44) have also been assisting him. “He inspired us and we are associated with him,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/man-who-helps-immerse-ashes-of-dead-in-haridwar/articleshow/82151992.cms||Ashish Mehta

---||Hyderabad||Orders reserved in Emaar case||Hyderabad: Wondering why Enforcement Directorate (ED), probing the Emaar fraud, has not made Challa Suresh and Partha Sarathy, the two villa plot buyers, as accused in the case, the high court on Monday reserved its orders in a quash plea filed by Koneru Madhu, an accused in the case. He challenged the charge sheet filed by ED against him. His counsel Avinash Desai said ED was proceeding against Madhu without any material. It is the case of ED that the villa plot buyers paid a portion of the plot rate in Hyderabad and deposited the rest in the bank account of Madhu in Dubai. This was reportedly done at the instance of Koneru Rajendra Prasad, one of the main accused in the case. “There is no material filed against Madhu that he has prior knowledge about the crime and the impending arrival of the money into his account,” Avinash said. The people who made the deposit were not made accused, nor the plots bought by them attached, he added. Appearing for ED, assistant solicitor general Namavarapu Rajeswara Rao said that the Section 24 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) puts the burden of proof on the accused. “Let the probe go on and the truth prevails,” he said. Justice G Sri Devi concluded the hearing and reserved orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/orders-reserved-in-emaar-case/articleshow/82151997.cms||---

However, vaccination numbers remained low for the second consecutive day due to shortage of doses. On Monday, as many as 31 private centres couldn’t administer a single dose as they had run out of vaccine stocks. Several public hospitals were hit too. At R N Cooper Hospital in Juhu, for instance, only those coming for their first doses were given the jab. Many dropping in towards the latter half of the day were asked to visit later. Mumbaikars have also been facing difficulty to book appointments for a second dose on Co-Win, although people are getting the vaccine when they walk into the centres directly. A total of 35,309 people got vaccinated on Monday, which was slightly more than Sunday’s turnout of 27,189, but much lower than the high of 50,000 that Mumbai had hit in the first two weeks. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said they are expecting some vaccine doses to reach the city on Tuesday. Of the 20 lakh doses, 7.7 lakh have been given to senior citizens, nearly 6.7 lakh to people above 45 years, nearly 3 lakh to frontliners and 2.7 lakh to healthcare workers. The state-wide vaccination numbers for Sunday too showed a stark drop. As many as 1,27,079 people could get vaccinated, a huge drop from the state’s average of 3.5 lakh. On good days, Maharashtra has managed to inoculate upto 4.7 lakh people in one day. State officials said the erratic supply has hit the momentum of the vaccination drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-gives-20l-doses-since-jan-reaches-vax-milestone/articleshow/82152024.cms||---

Bareilly went to panchayat polls during the first phase on April 15. The victim’s wife, Kiran Devi, alleged that the accused had been threatening them for a few days, following which they had lodged a complaint with police, but nothing was done. The victim, Narendra Pal Gangwar, whose wife is defending her post, had an old political rivalry with one Dharmendra, said police. On Sunday evening, Dharmendra, his brother Narpat and five others attacked Narendra and later opened fire at them, said police. Police said both groups clashed violently, but Narendra went missing all of sudden, while four others were admitted to a hospital. On Monday morning, Narendra’s body — bearing multiple injuries inflicted by a sharp-edged weapon and a suspected bullet wound — was recovered from a field outside the village, said police.

In Salt Lake Sector V, the IT hub of Kolkata, the employees of many companies continue to work from home (WFH) while those, who had started partial or near full operations, are once again returning to the WFH mode. The head office of the corporate giant, ITC, was almost closed on Monday and none was allowed inside its office without any prior approval. In a circular issued on Saturday, state government advised the private establishments to re-introduce WFH, rotational days/hours/shifts as far as possible. Some of the corporate houses like ITC, RPSG Group, Haldia Petrochemicals, Exide, Emami have already given guidelines to their employees in this regard. The head office of Haldia Petrochemicals will continue with alternative day roaster with strict Covid protocol, said HPL director, Subhasendu Chatterjee who also confirmed that a suitable provision of WFH has been made for the employees of their both plants and the head office. Kalyan Kar, vice president, Sector V Stakeholders Association, told TOI: “The companies that continue to operate from offices have ensured that all measures to keep the workplaces safe are being followed. The cost and efficiency benefits derived from WFH have encouraged the companies to embrace this as a permanent plan and many of them are working on a hybrid strategy (WFH and office mix). Newer projects and technology initiatives are being outsourced while higher automation and smart procedures are replacing the replicable workforce.” However, the ITeS sector (BPO and call centres) is still struggling to balance their work due to some security and infrastructure issues, Kar added. The president of Sector V stakeholders association, S Radhakrishnan, agreed with the views of Kar. Leading chambers have also advised its members to follow the state guidelines. An executive of Exide said there would be 30% attendance from this week. The managing director of Berger Paints, Abhijit Roy, said they have already introduced WFH for a large section of the workforce. The chairman of Ambuja Neotia group, Harsh Neotia, said they would implement the guidelines as far as possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/work-from-home-schedule-returns-as-pvt-firms-switch-to-stricter-pandemic-protocol/articleshow/82150782.cms||Udit Prasanna Mukherji

---||Kochi||Kochi: Police arrest Sanu Mohan for daughter’s murder||KOCHI: Weeks after the body of a school girl was found in Muttar River on March 23, city police on Monday arrested her father Sanu Mohan for allegedly murdering his child. The mystery behind her death is yet to be fully solved as police say that Mohan was contradicting his statements ‘every 10 minutes’. We nabbed him from Karwar in Karnataka on Sunday. He confessed that he had killed his child, said commissioner Nagaraju Chakilam on Monday. He said police were looking for more evidence to find how he killed the girl. “We arrested him after finding that it was, prima-facie, a murder. His claim was that he had huge debt and due to the subsequent tension, he decided that his life can’t go on like this and he planned the act. He said that he didn’t want to abandon his daughter and so he killed her first. Then he wanted to kill himself, but it never happened. This is his claim. We are collecting evidence to verify it,” he said, adding that Mohan was not confident that his wife would look after their child. He added that no third party was involved. “That doubt has almost been cleared and it seems he planned and committed the crime,” said the officer. He added that Mohan must be questioned in custody to know more details. He was presented in court on Monday and police sought his custody for 15 days. Court granted police custody till 5pm on April 29. “We have autopsy, chemical examiner reports as evidence. He is giving contradictory statements about the step by step details of the incident. We will have to question him again,” said the commissioner. As per his primary statement, he and his child came to their flat in Kangarappady on the night of March 21. He told her about the plan to end their lives before trying to smother her. He then strangled the child. She fell unconscious and he dropped her body in the river. As per autopsy report, she drowned. Police said the EO wing of Mumbai police had filed a cheating case against Mohan, to the tune of over Rs 3 crore, in connection with his steel business in Pune. He was hiding from the police in Kochi amid huge debts. Circumstances led him to formulate an escape plan. Police said Mohan identified the blood stain in his flat as that of his daughter Vaiga’s. Police said that it was a herculean task to track him down as he was not using digital devices. “He sold his car in Coimbatore for Rs 50,000 and used the money to escape. Police managed to track him down after collecting several CCTV footage from areas, including Mookambika, where he was spotted. Mohan was booked under relevant sections of IPC for destruction of evidence and feeding substance with the intention of murder. He was booked under sections of JJ Act for ignoring the child and giving her substance like alcohol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cops-arrest-sanu-mohan-for-daughters-murder/articleshow/82149923.cms||---

The plant is expected to start operation soon. The plant will have the capacity to produce 200 cubic meter of oxygen per hour. “IFFCO’s oxygen plant in Kalol will generate medical-grade oxygen. It will be able to fill up 700 D-type (having storage capacity of 46.7 litres) and 300 B-type cylinders (having capacity of 10 litres) every day,” IFFCO tweeted on Monday. This plant is currently at erection stage and installation stage. According to IFFCO, the oxygen produced at the plant will be given free to hospitals. The world’s largest fertilizer co-operative will give the oxygen cylinders for free to hospitals. However, a security deposit will be taken if cylinders are taken from IFFCO to prevent hoarding, added an IFFCO spokesperson. It is not just Gujarat, IFFCO is also putting up three more oxygen plants in other states as well. These plants are being installed at Aonla in Bareilly and Phulpur in Prayagraj of Uttar Pradesh as well as Paradeep, Odisha. IFFCO has estimated a total investment for all the four plants, including the one in Gujarat, at Rs 30 crore. “A dedicated committee of skilled engineers has already been formed for these plants and IFFCO is trying to get all the four plants up and running in the next 15 days,” the IFFCO spokesperson further added. The move to establish oxygen plants has come at a time when there is a huge shortage of medical oxygen, which a critical requirement in the treatment of Covid-19 patients.

Later, after a protest for hours, they were allowed to enter the mandis and gate passes were issued to them. They alleged that they had registered on ‘Meri Fasal Mera Byora’ portal as per the Haryana government norms, yet government agencies were not procuring wheat from them and that of foodgrain from Haryana was going on at the same time. The protest caused the long queues of tractor-trolleys on the service lane of the National Highway-44. “I had reached outside Karnal Mandi on Sunday night.

In a letter to the Ahmedabad Hospital and Nursing Home Association (ANHA) and Ahmedabad Medical Association (AMA), the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has urged the doctor members of two bodies to follow “guidelines towards the usage of remdesivir”, and that “to ensure rational use the drug.” The letter released to the press by the AMC for the public does not mention the remdesivir protocol as directed by the high court.“Remdesivir prescription protocol is known to all doctors. It is there is the Union health ministry’s guidelines,” said a senior AMC official.According to the July 2020 health ministry guidelines on remdesivir, the drug is only for restricted emergency use on patients with moderate disease (those on oxygen support). The ministry had informed that the dosage of remdesivir should be 200mg IV on day 1 followed by 100mg IV daily for 4 days (5 days in total). The Gujarat high court on April 16 had called for breaking the myth that remdesivir is a life-saving drug for Covid-19 patients in order to end the shortage of it and black marketing. In a one-page letter the AMC’s medical officer of health (MoH) Bhavin Solanki admitted that the present pandemic has put untoward pressure on the existing health infrastructure in terms of oxygen supply, ventilators and availability of beds. During two hearings before the HC, the state government made detailed submissions on how remdesivir, the most sought-after medicine during this third surge of Covid-19 cases in Gujarat, is not a life-saving drug and not meant for Covid-19 patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/follow-remdesivir-prescription-protocol-amc-to-doctors/articleshow/82153112.cms||---

This has happened due to the increased need for oxygen. It can be resolved by using industrial oxygen cylinders for medical oxygen. The specifications are the same for both. This way, we will be able to increase supply of D type cylinders immediately,’ the letter stated. ‘We request you to instruct the officials concerned immediately to avert any major disaster due to unavailability of oxygen at Covid hospitals.’AHNA members said most hospitals have seen a three or four-fold increase in oxygen consumption over the past few days. ‘The producers will have to ensure that they are working 24x7 so that the pick-up vans of the distributors are able to pick up liquid oxygen as required,’ the letter said. The members also requested the government to allow oxygen transporters to use the BRTS lane for faster movement.Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of AHNA, said all stakeholders are working round-the-clock to tide over the current wave of infections. “Oxygen is the mainstay of treatment and uninterrupted supply is literally the lifeline for patients.

---||Delhi||Delhi: His own cop out, 80-year-old gets help from police||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police came to the aid of an 80-year-old Covid-positive man in central Delhi after his daughter asked the cops to take care of him because she herself was terrified of visiting him for fear of the coronavirus. The hapless man had hung a board outside his house saying his body should be handed over to police for the final rites. Instead, a constable rushed to the aid of the octogenarian and took him to hospital — a timely intervention when the man’s oxygen level was dipping to below the normal. Jasmeet Singh, DCP (Central), said on Monday, “The Rajinder Nagar police station received a phone call from the daughter of the 80-year-old patient. She said that her father was having a serious health problem and suffering from fever for the past few days. She also confessed that she did not want to visit her father due to the risk of contracting Covid.” Constable Rajuram reached the house, which he identified easily because he found a poster outside that said the resident’s body may be handed to the police after his death. An ambulance was summoned to the address and the patient was evacuated by the medical staff. DCP Singh said, “Constable Rajuram went with the patient, who was later identified as Murlidharan. He stayed with the old man for around three hours despite the possible risk of infection.” The senior citizen is now undergoing treatment at the hospital. Delhi Police has been exhibiting its humanitarian side while assisting people, among them numerous Covid-19 patients, in this time of such crisis. Even when family members are deserting their parents and kin, the cops have been stepping in to extend a helping hand. In another incident, policemen were patrolling at Jaffarpur Kalan and spotted an unconscious man on Phirni Road. The visibly old man’s condition appeared critical. He was immediately taken to a nearby doctor. After a check-up, police bought the prescribed medicines for the elderly person and then dropped him home safely. In Dwarka, the cops were informed about the death of a 93-year-old Covid-infected patient. Police arranged an ambulance to take the body to the hospital and later to the crematorium.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/his-own-cop-out-80-yr-old-gets-help-from-police/articleshow/82152022.cms||---

The contraband originating from Makran Coast, Pakistan, was found concealed inside the boat, which carried five Sri Lankan nationals. The seizure is a major hit on the international drug peddling mafia and the boat and the crew member will be brought to Kochi for further investigation. “INS Suvarna, whilst on surveillance patrol in the Arabian Sea, encountered a fishing vessel with suspicious movements. To investigate the vessel, the ship’s team conducted boarding and search operation, which led to the seizure of more than 300kg of narcotic substances. The approximate cost of the catch in the international market is estimated to be Rs 3,000 crore. The boat with its crew has been escorted to the Kochi port for further investigation,” said a statement from the Navy. According to the Navy, it was a major catch not only in terms of the quantity and cost but also from the perspective of disruption of the illegal narcotics smuggling routes, which emanate from the Makran coast and flow towards Indian, Maldivian and Sri Lankan destinations. “Apart from the human costs from drug addiction, the spoils of narcotics trade feed syndicates involved in terrorism, radicalization and criminal activities,” said the Navy’s statement. The flow of synthetic drugs through the Arabian Sea with the help of fishing vessels, mostly from Sri Lanka, is a serious issue being addressed by the maritime enforcement agencies, especially the Indian Navy and Indian Coast Guard. In March, the patrolling ICG units seized 300kg high grade heroin and five AK-47 rifles with 1,000 live rounds from Sri Lankan fishing boat Ravihansi off Minicoy. Earlier in a major drug-hunt operation that lasted nearly 10 days in November, the ICG had seized around 100kg of heroin, 20 small packets of synthetic drugs after intercepting a Sri Lankan boat with six crew members off Kanyakumari-coast. The ICG had also recovered a Thuraya satellite phone set and five 9mm pistols from the boat ‘Shenaya Duwa’ in the operation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/navy-seizes-narcotics-substance-worth-rs-3000cr/articleshow/82149965.cms||---

But Ludhiana has vaccines stock for three to four days as on Monday morning. The health department said they update the demand daily and have written to the higher authorities for more vaccines. District immunisation officer Dr Puneet Juneja confirmed that they have 10,000 doses of Covishield in stock which can be used comfortably for three days whereas they have 18,000 to 19,000 doses of Covaxin, which are sufficient for three for four days. He added that whereas they are using Covaxin in urban centres, they are injecting Covishield mostly in rural centres. DIO said in urban area, Covishield is being used for vaccination in four centres. He added that issue in using both vaccines in centres is that it is difficult to run parallel IDs for vaccines on a system and so they use either Covishield or Covaxin. The health department officer said they have written to state authorities for more vaccines and demand is updated regularly. He added that whatever supply state gets, Ludhiana gets proportionate doses out of that. “The hands of state authorities are also tied and whatever supply they get we get highest number of doses from that as consumption in Ludhiana is more,” said a health department official, involved in vaccination process. “On Monday, we injected Covishield at four centres including at Civil Hospital, Civil Surgeon’s office, Mother and Child Hospital Vardhman and Urban Community Health Centre at Jawaddi. Mostly, second dose were being given to the persons who have received first dose of same vaccine.” Health experts said there is shortage of vaccine on the ground. “Reports from ground suggest that there is shortage of vaccine. Government needs to send more vaccines so that more people are vaccinated in view of the second surge,” said Ludhiana Indian Medical Association (IMA) president Dr Saroj Aggarwal. Meanwhile, many residents were questioning the government’s move to expor” vaccines when country also needed those. “I have heard that they have limited stock of vaccines left in Ludhiana district. Vaccines availability is in the Centre’s hand and instead of providing vaccines for countrymen they exported doses of the same. This happened at a time when we desperately needed vaccines to check second wave,” said Keemti Rawal, a social activist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/vaccine-stock-only-will-last-for-4-days-only/articleshow/82153104.cms||Shariq Majeed

The daily cases of Covid have reached over 450 in the last few days while the number of patients in critical condition is also increasing. Therefore, the oxygen demand has risen. District collector Daulat Desai has asked the officials to set up Covid centres with each of the beds having an oxygen cylinder fitted to them. Manoj Ayya, the food inspector and coordinator for the medical oxygen supply, said, “The daily generation capacity of two main manufacturers is around 30 metric tonne. Currently, the demand from neighbouring districts, where there are no manufacturers, is rising rapidly. To reach the peak of oxygen availability, the daily cases needs to double. However, if the need arises, the manufacturers have to ensure the Covid care centres of the district are given priority as per district collector’s order.” Meanwhile, the administration is planning to set up oxygen plants, which uses atmospheric oxygen, purifies it and supplies directly to sub-district hospitals and Covid care centres. The state’s first such plant has been set up at the sub-district hospital of Gadhinglaj and it can generate oxygen, which can be filled in 130 cylinders. Recently, state health minister Rajesh Tope announced that similar plants, though costly, will be set up across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-daily-o2-use-hits-13-metric-tonne/articleshow/82149131.cms||---

At a time when the Covid-19 situation is worsening, the university had decided to conduct the exams in online format and for this it had asked students to choose between online and offline (pen and paper) exams by April 17. Of the total 65,000 students expected to take the exams this year, about 32,000 have opted for the online exams, said an official at GU. So the varsity will now have to make arrangements to conduct pen-and-paper exams for about 33,000 students, he added. Students who did not opt for any of the two options will by default be considered for pen-and-paper format, the varsity had announced earlier. The university has plans to finish holding exams by May-end so that the next academic session can begin from June. Gujarat University had earlier announced that exams will be held from April 12. The exams were to be held in pen-and-paper format. Keeping in view the surge in Covid-19 cases in Gujarat, GU then put the exams on hold. In March, the varsity had initiated examination process but after completion of the first exam paper for semester-1, it decided to defer exams after the state government announced closure of all colleges till April 10.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal schools shut for summer holidays||KOLKATA: The state on Monday decided to close all government, government-aided and government-sponsored schools from Tuesday, bringing forward the summer vacation nearly a month ahead of schedule. The government directive—issued due to the surge in Covid cases in Bengal—has also requested private schools to follow the advisory. With the vacation being declared, even teachers will not have to attend schools. But the government did not issue any directive against holding online classes during the break. “We have not given out instructions about suspending online classes even in the government, aided and sponsored schools. Schools are grappling with a shorter time period to complete the syllabus due to the pandemic. Any further restrictions on online coaching during the summer vacation will mean an additional delay in finishing the curriculum. Usually, online teaching stays suspended during vacations. This time, we will not take such a call. It depends on schools how they want to schedule virtual classes during the summer recess. Only physical attendance will remain suspended during the break,” said a school education department official. “The temperature has also shot up in south Bengal,” a state official added. Usually summer holidays are declared around the second week of May. TOI on Saturday reported the plight of students and teachers at state board-affiliated schools, where in the absence of any directive from the government, on-campus lessons for classes IX and X were being held amid the pandemic. But as Covid cases had started soaring, private schools, affiliated to other boards, suspended their physical classes for IX to XII and went back to online teaching. The decision has, however, led to confusion among CISCE schools conducting Class-XII boards practicals on campus as several exams and viva were yet to be over. Also, the council is yet to send a notification. While some schools pointed to an council earlier directive asking them to follow state orders, others wondered how exams, such as biology practical, already slated for Wednesday could be suspended. ““The state requested private schools if they could shut early for summer vacation. We are closing. But about biology practical, we are waiting for a notification from the council. Until then, we will continue with bio practical exams slated for 21 April,” ?” said Richard Gasper, principal of St Augustine’s Day School on Ripon Street. Sujoy Biswas, principal of Ram Mohan Mission School, decided to postpone the remaining ISC practical and viva exams after a verbal go-ahead from the council. ISC practical exams are scheduled to be over by May 31. CISCE chief executive and secretary, Gerry Arathoon said, “We have given schools a window to finish practical exams within a stipulated time. It is their call. In case of any confusion, school heads should revert to the council.” Schools that have only one exam left said they would shut after conducting it while some other institutes, which have several practical exams, will postpone them indefinitely. CBSE is yet to send any instruction. . “Practical exams and viva voce will continue as per schedule, following all precautions. The government on Monday advised schools under the state board to start summer holidays from Tuesday. But CBSE is yet to send any directive...” read a circular from South Point on Monday. School spokesperson Krishna Damani said physical classes between IX and XII had been suspended. “Our summer vacation will be spread over multiple slots from mid-May. About complying with the state order, we will continue with Class XII practical exams and with online classes for the rest,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-schools-shut-for-summer-holidays/articleshow/82150882.cms||Somdatta Basu
---||Kolkata||Telemedicine||Kolkata: Various doctor bodies have tele-medicine consultation voluntarily to covid positive patients who are on home isolation. They feel that this will ease the burden off the government’s tele-medicine facilities that are flooded with calls from anxious patients. From just about 200 such calls on a daily average the state health department’s tele-medicine cell currently is getting over 1000 calls daily. The Association of Health Service Doctors (AHSD) has a team of 20 doctors who would be providing free tele-medicine services to covid infected people who are on home isolation. “Our Telemedicine team will provide medical advices over phone. This service is absolutely free and is meant only for COVID patients staying in home isolation,” said doctors Anup Roy and Manas Gumta president and general secretary respectively of AHSD. The Covid Care Network (CCN) that run such facilities during the first wave too has activated its telemedicine services. CCN has a number of medical professionals and the organisation has been working for covid care right from the beginning of the pandemic – be it awareness of Covid-19 responsible behaviour, stigmatisation on covid patients and family members, helping with ambulance service etc. The organisation will start managing a safe home for covid patients soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/telemedicine/articleshow/82150796.cms||---

The four-time Lok Sabha MP breathed his last at AIIMS Rishikesh. He was brought to the medical facility on Saturday with a severe infection in the lungs. His Covid-19 report had returned negative initially but he was later found to be infected with the virus. His body was airlifted to his hometown Haldwani on Monday for the last rites which were attended by several senior BJP leaders. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a tweet, said, "The death of senior BJP leader and former Union minister of state Bachi Singh Rawat is deeply painful.

---||Kolhapur||SC seeks state’s response on plea to defer Gokul poll||Kolhapur: The Supreme Court on Monday sought a response from the Maharashtra government over a petition demanding postponement of the Kolhapur district cooperative dairy (Gokul) election, which is conducted once every five years.The matter was being heard by the SC bench comprising Justices U U Lalit and K M Joseph. The court will again hear the matter on April 26. The issue has caused a political slugfest among leaders of Kolhapur district. Petitoner Ravindra Patil had earlier approached the Bombay high court seeking stay over the election, the voting for which is going to take place on May 2. The petitoner, meanwhile, had moved the petition to the SC for final order.Louis Shah, the legal adviser of the dairy said, “Maninder Singh was the lawyer for the petitoner. The hearing took place virtually. The Maharashtra government, which is party to the case, has been asked to submit it’s view on the plea by April 26. The election process will continue as per plan.” Tuesday is the last day for withdrawal of the nominations. The election takes place panel-wise. Two panels are formed and leaders across political parties make up the two panels. However, the voter, who is the representative of a smaller cooperative milk dairy, can vote for any candidate of any of the two panels. There are over 1,300 dairies with a right of one vote each.The petitoner is said to be the close to the ruling panel led by Mahadevrao Mahadik and Congress MLA P N Patil. The opposition leaders such as ministers Satej Patil and Hasan Mushrif are alleging that due to fear of defeat, the ruling faction is trying hard to postpone the election.Mushrif even said that since there are no public meetings held, no direct contact with large number of people while campaigning, therefore, there is no threat of Covid. However, leaders of ruling faction such as Dhananjay Mahadik claim that the recent death of one of the dairy representatives due to Covid shows that there is need to postpone the election.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/sc-seeks-states-response-on-plea-to-defer-gokul-poll/articleshow/82149150.cms||---

All the members were infected. I decided to provide food to them and roped in a caterer, who initially used his own staff for delivery,” Patil, who runs an NGO, told TOI.“As more people got to know of the initiative, I was flooded with calls and messages requesting that meals be provided to them. But the caterer was not able to deploy more delivery staff. Eight other residents then came forward to help. Interestingly, none of them have met personally so far. Nashik city is full of kind-hearted people,” said Patil.Four caterers are preparing the meals and the group members deliver them.Prashant Jadhav, a 55-year-old mechanical engineer and businessman, delivers food to around 10 households. “There is an elderly couple who have no one to look after them. Both have tested positive. The woman waits for me eagerly. It feels good to see the smiles on their faces,” Jadhav said.Shankar Appa Kadam, a taxi driver, delivers the food to several homes and hospitals. He refused to take fuel charges from Patil. “These are trying times and we must help in whatever way we can. I told Patil that I cannot support his project financially, but I will help deliver the food,” he said.Businessman Pawan Khetwani, uses his two-wheeler to deliver food to 10 homes. “At times like this, people must come forward to help others.

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Show prescription, Aadhaar card to buy antiviral drug||CHANDIGARH: A day after police busted a racket of black-marketing of Remdesivir in the city, the health department on Monday made it mandatory for buyers to show Aadhaar card and doctor’s prescription to buy the over the counter drug to prevent hoarding. “This not schedule H drug, so one can sell it over the counter. But we have started this system so that anyone who procures the drug is unable to hoard it,” said Amit Duggal, drug control officer, UT. However, doctors feel as the cases have surged, this peak has shown high lung involvement leading to rapid deterioration. “Deaths would be higher if not started on treatment earlier. Patients with moderate degree of lung involvement with elevated biomarkers should be offered Remdesivir - late initiation has poor outcomes with morbidity and longer stay in hospital,” said Dr Amit Mandal, a renowned pulmonologist in a Mohali based private hospital. In fact, doctors in the PGI recommend the drug only when the admitted patients fall in oxygen saturation and have white spots shown on the chest Xray or CT scan. “As this is mainly a drug used for moderate to severe rheumatic arthritis, it should be used to inflate the hospital stay. It can else do more harm than treat,” said a doctor at the PGI. Also last year, the WHO had issued a conditional recommendation against the use of Remdesivir in hospitalized patients. The solidarity trials conducted by the WHO found that there was no evidence that Remdesivir improves survival and other outcomes in these patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/show-prescription-aadhaar-card-to-buy-antiviral-drug/articleshow/82149973.cms||Shimona Kanwar

However, its implementation is in limbo. Many colleges are finding it hard to run the courses as the varsities are yet to finalize the syllabi for most hybrid courses. Even though some autonomous colleges have drafted their own syllabi with the help of subject experts the universities are yet to approve it. Many colleges admitted students and started classes in the hope that the syllabi would be approved soon. But the semester exams could not be conducted as the universities’ final say on the syllabus and structure of the course is yet to be announced. For instance, most colleges under Mahatma Gandhi University (MGU) that received affiliation to conduct the integrated courses are facing the issue of lack of approved syllabus. Around 10 colleges received permission to start the courses which include integrated programmes in languages – English, basic sciences-chemistry, in computer science – data science, etc. Some colleges decided to stop admissions as parents are raising concerns about the lack of a proper syllabus and delay in conducting board exams. “Even though the colleges have informed the varsity about the concerns, the issues regarding the syllabus remain unresolved. Teachers are conducting the courses as the colleges have admitted the students already. But they are unsure whether what they are teaching now will be approved by the varsity. The same issue prevails in most colleges affiliated to other varsities in the state too,” said the principal of a leading college in Ernakulam. However, varsity officials said that the process of finalizing the syllabus is underway in most subjects with help of experts in respective boards of studies. “These are new courses hence the final approval of the syllabus will take some time. Moreover, the pandemic has affected the process and we hope to complete them soon,” said a senior official of MGU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/varsities-yet-to-approve-syllabi-for-new-gen-courses/articleshow/82149994.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Dehradun||Snan of ‘Dev Doli’ to take place on April 24 & 25, says tourism minister||DEHRADUN: The ritual bathing festival of Dev Doli in which villagers bring their local deities for a dip in the Ganga at Haridwar during Kumbh will take place as scheduled on April 24 and 25, said tourism minister Satpal Maharaj. He added that all Covid-19 norms will be followed while undertaking the ritual in which deities from across the hills of Uttarakhand are brought to Haridwar. He further said that he has already sought isolation coaches in trains from the railway ministry in view of the prevailing Covid-19 scenario. The announcement comes despite April 25 being a Sunday — when lockdown restrictions are put in place in 12 districts of Uttarakhand. Last week, the Uttarakhand government had ordered a weekend lockdown in Dehradun and a Sunday lockdown in the other 12 districts. “We are prepared for the Kumbh Snan of Dev Dolis which will take place in Haridwar this Saturday and Sunday. The government has announced a weekly curfew because of the increasing cases of coronavirus but I had a word with the chief minister and I have requested him to allow this snan as people have been waiting for it for long. All necessary instructions have also been given to the policemen and other employees to be deployed on duty for the snan,” said Satpal Maharaj. Requesting the pilgrims arriving in Uttarakhand for the Kumbh or for the Char Dham Yatra, which is scheduled to start from May 14, Maharaj said that all visitors must follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, including maintaining social distancing, wearing face mask and use of sanitizers. Maharaj added that he has written a letter to the Union minister of railways Piyush Goel requesting him to provide train isolation coaches for Uttarakhand. He said that the state government is committed to providing a safe environment to the devotees who are coming from every corner of the country and the world. “We are holding the Kumbh currently and the Char Dham Yatra will start from the next month. Keeping in mind the safety of devotees, I have requested the central government to provide train isolation coaches in Haridwar and Rishikesh,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/snan-of-dev-doli-to-take-place-on-april-24-25-says-tourism-minister/articleshow/82149974.cms||Ishita Mishra

His parents had tested positive for Covid-19 and recovered. Yash’s antibody test was positive, leading doctors to safely presume that he too may have been infected but asymptomatic. Further investigation revealed that Yash had suffered from multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a serious condition associated with Covid-19. With the novel coronavirus gripping a large number of kids in this wave, doctors fear a bigger re-run of MIS-C which they saw in the previous pandemic wave too. “Looking at the constant surge in Covid-19 infections among children, we fear an increase in MIS-C cases too in the next two months,” said Dr Rakesh Gami, a paediatrician in Rajkot who treated 36 such kids from August to December 2020 and is treating Yash.  According to doctors, when children get infected by coronavirus, they usually have mild symptoms and recover quickly. However, after four to six weeks of recovery, many of them developed MIS-C world over. The way infected adults get critical, children between the age group of 5 to 12 years develop this serious condition post-Covid. Surat-based paediatric and intensivist Dr. Jignesh Vaidya said, “We treated around 45 children in our hospitals for MIS-C in the first wave. Parents did not even know that their ward was infected with Covid-19 but their antibody tests revealed that they had been positive and recovered. In the current wave, many children have been infected, so cases of MIS-C will surge in the coming days.” Experts say the antibodies that get developed to fight Covid affecting kids' systems post-Covid, trigger the immune system to attack the body. Children get critical and they need ventilator support. Remdesivir type of medicines are ineffective because there is no virus in the children. Dr. Divyang Bhimani, another paediatrician in Rajkot said, “I treated around 12 children with this syndrome in the last wave. One of the symptoms include severe abdominal pain, but when sonography is performed, nothing is found.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/post-covid-kids-at-risk-of-inflammatory-syndrome/articleshow/82159848.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Punjab board has charged Rs 200 registration fee for classes V and VIII in ggovernment schools and Rs 550 from Class V and Rs 850 for Class VIII students from private, affiliated, and associate schools. There are 5,000 affiliated and associated schools in the state and more than 1,000 schools in Ludhiana alone. Parent of Kriti, a student of Class V of a private school in Dana Mandi, said, “I had arranged the fee with extreme difficulty. My daughter was studying well and I wanted her to find a good job in the future. But now that the PSEB has cancelled the exam, it should refund us the fee.” It’s a demand echoed by many other parents and guardians of classes V, VIII, and X PBSE students, particularly those not well off. Secretary-general of Punjab Private School Organisation (PPSO) Tejpaul Singh said the board must refund the money since it does not have to pay the invigilators and examiners, or spend on setting up exam centres. “The fee covers all kinds of expenses related to the conduct of the exams. Since the board need not make these expenditures now, it must refund the fees. Parents are demanding the fees and when CM said no schools should ask for fees, why hould PSEB board ask for the exam registration fees? It should be transferred to the bank accounts of students immediately,” added Tejpaul. Thakur Aanand From Joint Action Front said, “Last year too, not a single exam was held and they have promoted students without taking the exam. Therefore, exam fees should be waived off.” JR Mehrok, comptroller of PSEB said, “The board has already spent the money preparing the question papers, printing answer sheets and the funds have been exhausted.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pseb-exam-cancelled-parents-and-schools-demand-registration-fees-back/articleshow/82153126.cms||Mehak Jain

According to BMC data, of the 215 cases reported in Worli Koliwada in the last two months, 164 were in the 19 days of April alone. In the adjoining areas, of the 56 cases reported in Janata Colony in the two months, 37 were in April, and in Jijamata Nagar, 29 of the 43 cases in March-April were this month. In Adarsh Nagar, 40 Covid cases were reported in March and 103 in April. Civic officials pointed out that this time round, fatality has been low and recovery rate high in these pockets in G-South ward. While there were two Covid-related deaths, 60 patients from Worli Koliwada have recovered, 49 from Adarsh Nagar, 18 from Janata Colony, and 15 from Jijamata Nagar. Assistant municipal commissioner Sharad Ughade said the entire city is witnessing a rise in cases and so is Worli Koliwada and its adjoining pockets. “These areas house a large number of service category people living like house help, delivery persons and also frontline workers again step out for work every day. So, we have decided to set up a vaccination centre in Koliwada itself so that more people are encouraged to get inoculated,” he said. But residents are worried. Advocate Dhanpal Jain from Worli said it seems that last year’s nightmare of coronavirus and the subsequent lockdown seems to have returned. “For most of last year, people stayed indoors out of fear because no one knew anything about the virus. As Worli village is a congested area, it is difficult to control the spread of the infection. Also the population here increased drastically in the last few years burdening the infrastructure,” said Jain. “And a year later, the nightmare is back. Once again we are seeing buildings being sealed owing to spike in cases,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-worli-koliwada-citys-no-1-hotspot-last-year-sees-rise-in-cases-yet-again/articleshow/82152112.cms||Richa Pinto

A majority of students failed in the first semester exam of MCom 2019-21 regular batch, as per results published on April 13. Of the 2,482 students who wrote the exam, only 773 passed in all subjects. Most of them failed in management optimization and specialized accounting subjects. Students had approached the VC and the governor, who is the chancellor, after the results were published. Thomas considered the complaint of the students and issued orders for an emergency probe. Students alleged carelessness on the part of teachers as the reason for the mass failure. The students who achieved good marks in the internals too failed in the exams. University authorities cited that the new syllabus introduced from the current academic year could have also been a reason for the failures. The report will be tabled on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/probe-begins-into-mass-student-failures-at-mgu/articleshow/82150000.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Techie creates fake websites of cos to make over Rs 49 lakh||MUMBAI: An M Tech professional who develops websites (mithilainfo.com) has been arrested for creating fake websites in the name of real companies to lure clients into seeking dealership or franchise contract by paying hefty deposit amounts. He has duped at least 100 people to the tune of Rs 49 lakh within a year, said the cyber police.  Sonu Chaudhary (27), was arrested this month from Darbhanga in Bihar based on a complaint filed by Ceat Tyres, as the fake website created in its name was used to siphon lakhs from gullible users. The cyber police suspect that the money earned from such fake deals will run into crores across different parts of the country.  Chaudhary developed 14 fake websites in the name of real companies such as Bajajfinance.co.in, JKtyresfranchises.co.in, Adityafinance.in, to name a few, to offer fake dealerships and franchises. He has also created 150 fake company websites that use similar modus operandi.  “The fake and genuine websites look similar. Chaudhary did this due to job insecurity and make a quick buck. He used fake documents to open bank accounts where the victims deposited money,” said DCP (Cyber) Rashmi Karandikar. The fraud came to light after the victims called up Ceat officials to find out about the status of their dealership or franchise agreement for which they had deposited Rs 49,000 each. The company filed a complaint on January 8 and Chaudhhary was arrested. The cyber police have also arrested a computer software engineer, Ashish Ahir (32) in January who had to quit his job in London due to the pandemic. In order to pay off his debts, Ahir opened a fake shopping website that resembled genuine ones selling women’s wear— shopiiee.com—to dupe people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-techie-creates-fake-websites-of-cos-to-make-over-rs-49-lakh/articleshow/82153135.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

This increases work for the remaining workforce. We faced this situation last year as well,” said a faculty member. He said, “The pace with which the health workers are getting infected is faster compared to last year.” With the workforce getting affected, things can worsen for those who need hospitalisation. “That is the reason OPDs have been halted, so that the remaining manpower remains protected and can be used as a backup for Covid emergency,” said a senior official in the UT health department. Out of these 400, nearly half of them have been vaccinated. Though vaccination against Covid does not claim to offer 100% protection, it reduces the severity of the infection. More than 14,000 of 22,000 health care workers at the institute have been vaccinated. Half of them have been given the first dose, while almost one fourth fully vaccinated. More than 80% of the faculty members have been vaccinated, while more than 85% of the senior residents have received their dose. Sources said there have been cases where antibody levels have been found to be sufficient in some health care workers and those who had been fully immunised, were also tested positive even after a month of the vaccination. “This highlights the necessity of wearing masks. In health care settings, there is more exposure due to patients and lack of ventilation,” said a public health expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/400-pgi-health-workers-test-ve-in-2-months/articleshow/82150004.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Members have been requesting authorities for to keep reading room open for the last two weeks. Students claim that they have been adversely affected in their studies, which has put their future in jeopardy. A C Joshi Library, Chandigarh, which is the parent library has been opened and when students demanded the opening of the reading hall, they were assured that as and when the parent library would open, the reading facility of the extension library would also be opened. However, authorities have overlooked students’ demands. A letter was submitted on April 5 to director of Panjab University Regional Centre. Dilawar Singh, president of PUEL told TOI, “No orders of opening the reading hall were received from authorities and therefore we are left with no other option but to start a peaceful protest to access our rights. Authorities should understand the plight of students and in return, we would assure them to follow Covid-19 protocols.” According to him, Panjab University authorities are solely responsible for the precarious situation arising on the campus due to the constant delay in reopening of the reading room in the extension library. “If our demand is not met soon, we may approach students’ organisations to raise the issue further,” added Singh. A member from the extension library, Gurpreet said, “I am preparing for civil service exams for the last 5 years. I am like most other members and we have an exam on 27 June. Also last year Punjab Government announced government jobs and it is a great opportunity for job seekers. The extension library is the best place for most underprivileged members of society who cannot afford books and magazines for their preparation. We urge the Director of PURC to reopen the library. As it is synchronized with Panjab University Chandigarh library which has open now for students and private members.” On the same Director, Panjab University Regional Center, Dr. Ravi Inder Singh, said, " Members have given representation to me and I have escalated with higher authorities and they will look into the matter. The library is open for members and they can issue and re-issue the books but they are not allowed to sit in the library."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/students-protest-for-opening-of-extension-librarys-reading-hall-again/articleshow/82153131.cms||Mehak Jain

Some have even decided to shut all facilities on their campuses, except emergency service offices. Jadavpur University, which will reopen from Wednesday, will prepare a roster for each department. “Several of our staff members are down with the novel coronavirus. The university has undertaken an extensive sanitization programme and the campus has been closed. When we reopen, only 50% of the staff will be present, as instructed by the government order,” said a senior administrative official at JU.

In a long suicide note the deceased wrote about why he took the extreme step and also blamed the government for the dire straits the economy is in at present. Virendra Parmar, a resident of Devpara on Kothariya Road in Rajkot, was found hanging in his room on Sunday evening. As the deceased locked himself in his room for too long, his wife went upstairs to check on him. When the knocks went unanswered, she shouted for help. After the door was broke open the family found Parmar hanging. “Parmar owned a home furniture production unit. He was forced shut down his unit due to economic crisis arising out of the lockdown. Later, he started working in a factory but was laid off after few months,” his family told the police. Parmar in his suicide note blamed the government. “More people are committing suicide than dying because of Covid-19 infection but the government is hiding these numbers. The only cure to all problems is death,” Parmar, who was father of three kids, wrote in his suicide note.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/lockdown-losses-drive-rajkot-bizman-to-suicide/articleshow/82150932.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Centre chokes state with O2 cut, Nagpur faces the pinch on Tue||NAGPUR: At least two hospitals in city hit the panic button late on Tuesday evening and asked relatives to take the patients away as Covid treatment could not be continued due to shortage of oxygen supply. Late assurances by the collector to replenish stock has prompted these hospitals to retain the patients as of now. In a related setback, the Centre has reduced Maharashtra’s allotment from the Prax Air Sail Bhilai plant by almost 55%. In an order dated April 18, the state’s share has gone down from 110 metric tonnes (MT) to 60 metric tonnes from the plant. Nagpur used to get around 25 MT from Bhilai. Now, this quantity is likely to reduce. With the district already facing a shortage of Remdesivir and Tocilizumab drugs to tackle the north-bound Covid graph, district collector Ravindra Thakare dashed a letter to the state oxygen movement coordinator to take up the case with the Centre and restore the quota. Not just the treatment of current patients, lack of oxygen will also set back district’s plan to increase the number of beds. The district already faces an acute shortage of oxygen. While the requirement is 166.5 MT, Nagpur gets only 136 MT. Dr Anup Marar, convenor of the Vidarbha Hospital Association, said the shortage of oxygen has reached alarming levels. “Without oxygen, we are clueless how to continue treatment of patients who are currently admitted,” he said. Dr Prashant Jagtap, of the Viveka multispecialty hospital, said the management was planning to discharge about 100 patients (60 on Covid beds and 40 on non-Covid). “Oxygen was short in supply but the issue was resolved with the intervention of the collector and NMC,” he said. Another hospital in Dhantoli too called relatives to take away the patients. A relative who did not want to be identified by name said the 60 Covid patients managed to get beds allotted four days ago after a lot of struggle. “The staff wanted us to either take away the patients or get the oxygen cylinder refilled,” he said. The man added that family members of the patients took cylinders and began making rounds of the city for oxygen. “No one was ready to give a refill,” he said. A doctor from the hospital said 62 patients were on oxygen beds. “We had a stock of only 40 jumbo cylinders since morning. We requested the collector and many agencies for additional stock but to no avail. After our request, relatives of three patients took them other hospitals. Now, the collector has assured of supply. Treatment will continue only if we get it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/centre-chokes-state-with-o2-cut-nagpur-faces-the-pinch-on-tue/articleshow/82169728.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

With this additional tanker, the district administration now has four tankers, which are continuously ferrying liquid oxygen from the Konkan region. There are about eight to nine oxygen manufacturing plants in Nashik, which process the liquid oxygen to medical oxygen and provide the same through jumbo cylinders to private hospitals. Nade said the requirement of oxygen is fluctuating daily. The requirement is somewhere around 90 to 100 metric tonne. On Sunday, 75 metric tonne of oxygen was procured. An office bearer of a private doctors’ association, on the condition of anonymity, said the ground situation was still grim for the private hospitals with respect to oxygen availabilityHospital owners are arranging cylinders as such hospitals have a high requirement of oxygen. The association has again appealed to the administration to streamline the supply at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/pvt-hospitals-concerned-over-o2-supply/articleshow/82149185.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The man had tested positive on April 8 along with his elderly wife. He died in the Sector 48 hospital on April 15. “It takes time to record a death due to Covid as there has to be an audit. But in case the hospital has not informed Integrated Disease Surveillance Project, I shall inquire,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director health services, UT. “It is well known that the data is tweaked often. In case, many patients are reported in a day, the same is sometimes split into days, so that the numbers appear not that high,” said an official in the UT health department. When questions were put up before officials in Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, where the deceased’s son works, no one responded. “If a senior administrator is not following the protocol, it will set a wrong precedent. This is a pandemic. We all need to be responsible for each other's safety,” said a faculty member at GMCH. Sources said the senior doctor had been coming to the hospital, taking his daily rounds and performing operations. When he was asked about his quarantine period, he refused as “he had been completely immunised”. According to guidelines, close contacts of any confirmed positive case must be quarantined for a period of 14 days. A contact is a healthy person who comes in contact with an infected person.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/data-misses-covid-death-kin-not-quarantined/articleshow/82150015.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Kochi||Police yet to establish motive for murder||Kochi: Though Sanu Mohan, the father of Vaiga (11) was booked for her murder on Monday, the motive behind her murder remains a mystery as police are yet to believe his version the events. Though police believe that third parties weren’t involved, police say that an investigation, with him in custody for 15 days, would reveal the truth about his statements. The main contradiction in Mohan’s suicide plan is his elaborate escape plan. “Prima facie evidence indicates that he had prepared every step. His every move was to avoid getting caught. He was not leaving a trace … he said he wanted to die and he is taking money here and there. He is selling a car, selling gold and taking money…This behaviour and what he says is contradictory,” said commissioner Nagaraju Chakilam. He said that documentary evidence, including scientific evidence, like interim autopsy report and chemical report along with his confession was relied on to record the arrest. The presence of alcohol in the child’s body and the blood stain found in the flat at Kangarappady are other suspicious facts. “… alcohol content has been found and it is still mysterious. He has to be questioned about this. What he says now, he changes after 10 minutes. After half-an-hour he says something else. We have to question him intensely. That will happen and we have to gather evidence to find what he is saying and what he is not,” he said, adding that the DNA report on the blood stain is awaited. The commissioner added that Mohan did not agree with the finding that alcohol was found in the body of the child. “If we look at the sequence of events it was not an immediate response,” he said, adding that police were collecting evidence about the reports that he attempted suicide while he was at large. Meanwhile, DCP Aishwarya Dongre was sent to Mumbai to study the economic offences wing case against Mohan. According to the FIR there, he was accused in a cheating case. An investigation is on in this regard as well. The commissioner refused to divulge information on the teams investigating the case outside Kerala as it may hamper investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/police-yet-to-establish-motive-for-murder/articleshow/82150026.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata airport opens RT-PCR swab collection facility for flyers||KOLKATA: An RT-PCR swab collection facility that will provide the test results to the departing and arriving passengers within eight hours has been introduced at Kolkata airport. However, an onsite laboratory to carry out Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test that was to become operational at the airport last month is still awaiting statutory approvals. Speaking to TOI, Kolkata airport director Kaushik Bhattacharjee said passengers travelling to states that require RT-PCR from passengers on arrival could come to the airport early, get themselves tested and wait for the report in the lounge or return home and come back and collect the report before taking the flight. At present, travel to Port Blair, Ahmedabad, Baroda, Surat, Bhopal, Indore, Gwalior, Jabalpur, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Udaipur and Lucknow requires an RT-PCR test. For Port Blair, the test has to be done within 48 hours prior to departure while for the rest, it has to be done within 72 hours before leaving. The facility provided by Suraksha Diagnostics is available only on a single shift between 10 am and 6pm. "We will extend the timing if the response is good," an official said. While the swab samples are being collected at the airport, the tests are being carried out at a centralised unit in New Town. A state-of-the-art medical laboratory that has also been set up at the airport is still awaiting clearances. Once functional, it will offer three types of Covid tests: Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), TrueNat and Rapid Antigen Test (RAT). "The National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) has given its nod. It now requires the clearance of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the West Bengal Clinical Establishments (Registration, Regulation And Transparency) Act, 2017," an official explained. This facility is proposed to operate round the clock and have an initial capacity of testing 150 passengers per hour. This will be HLL’s first lab in the city. The company operates testing labs at Mumbai and Chennai airport. The two leading representatives of the travel trade industry — Travel Agents Federation of India and Travel Agents Association of India — have welcomed the initiative, pointing out that with Covid-19 here to stay, the need to get tested for travel within the country and overseas will persist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-airport-opens-rt-pcr-swab-collection-facility-for-flyers/articleshow/82150960.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The SLBC had issued a 13-point advisory to member banks last week, regarding the recurring wave of the pandemic. “While welcoming these action points, we submit that the situation warrants much more actions on the part of banks and employees to meet the aforesaid objective of safety,” wrote CD Josson, convener of UFBU, in his letter to convener of SLBC-Kerala. Regarding working hours, UFBU said, “As was implemented last year, there is an urgent necessity to restrict physical banking for next 4-6 months. Banks may be advised to reduce working hours (viz. from 10am to 2pm).” “Banking should be restricted to 5 days a week, to break the chain. This would cut the exposure of bankmen and the customers to a great extent, without impairing services,” Josson’s letter said. “Measures like working with one-third or half of staff strength, work from home, should be implemented for next 4-6 months. Staff/officers to be called on rotation so that exposure is reduced,” UFBU demanded. Vaccination of all bank employees, including family members, and exempting employees with existing comorbidities, pregnant employees, and persons with disabilities from duty are the other demands of the federation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/bank-unions-want-reduced-work-hours/articleshow/82150041.cms||---

In case of any requirement, the SDOs have to coordinate with an officer at the level of additional collector at the district headquarters. On Sunday, Mandhare held a meeting through video conferencing with senior officials of the district administration, health department, Nashik Municipal Corporation and Food and Drugs Administration. Mandhare said that the number of Covid-19 patients was increasing at an alarming rate all across the state, which has put immense stress on the supply of medical oxygen. On this backdrop, it has been decided to create a database of all the oxygen beds, ventilators, ICU beds in hospitals across the district. He has instructed the officials concerned to confirm the information provided by the hospital about the oxygen beds, ventilators. Instructions have also been issued to check if the medical oxygen was properly utilized as per the guidelines. With respect to the rising demand for remdesivir, the collector said some hospitals were simply telling the patients’ relatives to purchase the injection from outside. To overcome this situation, a centralized cell has been formed and supply is made in accordance with the patients in need of remdesivir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/teams-to-check-oxygen-remdesivir-supply/articleshow/82149201.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

CPM Alappuzha district secretary R Nasar and the husband of the complainant, who is also a member of the Purakkad local committee, attended the meeting. “While the district leadership demanded withdrawal of the complaint, all of the local committee members except one opined that the issue should be settled in an amicable manner.

Meanwhile, Ambalappuzha police took the statement of the complainant. She told the police that the minister made an anti-women statement. The controversy started with the minister making a statement regarding the marriage of his former personal staff at a press conference on April 11. The parents of the woman were against the marriage and they alleged that the personal staff of the minister abducted their daughter. This kickstarted a controversy, which led to the resignation of the personal staff.

Each vehicle is equipped with 25 cylinders of 7,000 litres each, besides other material. Civic officers will be present to monitor operations. The vehicles are stationed near BMC’s jumbo facility at Richardson and Crudas in Byculla, Poddar Hospital in Worli, Bandra’s KB Bhabha Hospital, Shatabdi Hospital in Kandivali and near the ward offices in Kurla and Bhandup. Additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu said Mumbai needs around 250 MT of oxygen daily. “These emergency response vehicles are mostly for the smaller medical facilities where oxygen may get exhausted faster,” he said. On Sunday, a team of civic engineers also brought 150 tonnes of oxygen to the city so that refilling could start wherever required. Velrasu said oxygen was brought from the JSW steel plant in Pen taluka and also from Jamnagar. However, the situation remained grim in Bandra’s Bhabha Hospital. “The ICU facility continues to remain closed as adequate oxygen has not arrived. These smaller cylinders can be used, but there is no guarantee when refilling will be done, hence officials are not risking admitting new patients,” said local corporator, Asif Zakeria. Terming them cosmetic arrangements, Byculla corporator and MLA Rais Shaikh said, “What can these small cylinders do for a city that needs over 200 MT of oxygen a day?” —Richa Pinto||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-6-emergency-vehicles-with-o2-near-hosps/articleshow/82152205.cms||Richa Pinto

The trust has been treating Covid patients at its super-speciality hospital and is also operating a Covid care centre. It has, however, been facing problems in ensuring a smooth supply of oxygen to these Covid facilities. “Reliance Industries has given a green signal to help the trust in setting up the two projects. Anant Ambani had called and assured me of help in establishing the oxygen plant and the RT-PCR lab at Shirdi,” said Bagate expressing his gratitude to Reliance Industries. Bagate added the trust needs to set up the oxygen plant as soon as possible to tide over the erratic supply. The SSST officials said that the venue for the plant would be decided shortly. “There is land available beside the Sai prasadalaya, which could be a possible location for the oxygen plant,” added the trust officials. Bagate said the SSST would make all efforts to start the RT-PCR lab within the next 10 days so that testing can be carried out and the lab reports can be made available without much delay. “Our Covid treatment facilities also need remdesivir stocks. I had contacted officials of a pharmaceutical firm involved in the production of the drug. The firm has assured us to provide an adequate number of remdesivir vials as soon as possible,” added Bagate. The temple town of Shirdi is in the Rahata taluka of Ahmednagar district. This taluka has been severely affected by Covid-19. On average, more than 200 new cases are being reported from that taluka every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/reliance-to-help-set-up-o2-plant-rt-pcr-lab-in-shirdi/articleshow/82149192.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Kolkata||Candidates in Bengal tweak rally rules to play it Covid-safe||KOLKATA: The rapidly rising Covid-19 graph in Kolkata and the rest of Bengal has prompted several candidates across party lines to suspend their campaign rallies and meetings. The few that are being held are kept low-key. Left Front was among the first to announce that it would not hold any big rally in the city, while chief minister Mamata Banerjee cut down on her campaigns. She has kept only one public meeting in the city on April 26 and restricted the rally durations in district to less than 30 minutes. BJP is going ahead with the meetings and roadshows of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah, but several of the party candidates in the city gave decided to follow all precautions during campaign. Former power minister and Trinamool candidate from Bhowanipore Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay was one of the first candidates to cut short his political programmes and reportedly told his supporters to focus on door-to-door campaigns rather than big rallies. “I have decided not to participate in any big rally, which may attract thousands of people. Instead, I will concentrate on door-to-door campaign, adhering to Covid-19 safety protocols and maintain physical distancing. I will take this campaign as an opportunity to appeal to citizens to take guard against the virus,” he said. Bhowanipore’s BJP candidate actor Rudranil Ghosh, who has multiple social media photos of interaction with voters without a mask, said he wore a mask every now and then but was forced to remove it during campaign. “Most people in this constituency don’t watch my Bengali films. They want to see my face. Further, people whisper their troubles and pains in my ears, and thus, Covid safety protocols get compromised at times. But I have cut down on the number of attendees in my campaigns to ensure social distancing,” said Ghosh. Trinamool Rashbehari candidate Debasis Kumar claimed he had never taken his mask off on campaigns. “People here know me well and they don’t need to see my face. I am asking my party supporters not to remove masks. I know many of them are not following the norms and so, I have shortened my campaigns and moving with a limited number of workers from door to door, to avoid big gatherings,” said Kumar. Advocate and BJP candidate from Entally Priyanka Tibrewal pointed out she had been strict about mask. She has also stopped door-to-door campaigns. . “At every party meeting and at the start of each rally, I have been asking my party workers to put on their masks, sanitise their hands and avoid eating out or sharing food and water. I have even asked supporters without a mask to leave my rally,” said Tibrewal. She added she had covered her constituency and so, she did not want to do door-to-door campaign to prevent the spread of the virus. Trinamnool’s Jorasanko candidate Vivek Gupta headed a rally with party MP Nusrat jahan on Monday evening. The candidate and his supporters were spotted wearing masks and the crowd was not very big either. “We have to be cautious. I wear mask all the time and insist my party workers do the same,” said Gupta. BJP’s candidate from Jorasanko Meena Devi Purohit insisted all her supporters wore masks properly when they accompanied her on campaigns. “If I see anybody without a mask, I request them to wear it immediately. We also try to practise social distancing,” said Purohit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/candidates-tweak-rally-rules-to-play-it-covid-safe/articleshow/82150977.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Ahmedabad||‘No proof lockdown breaks the chain’||GANDHINAGAR: Reiterating the state government’s stance that it is not in favour of a lockdown as a means to contain the spread of Covid-19, deputy chief minister Nitin Patel, in Gandhinagar on Monday, said it cannot be stated scientifically that clamping of lockdown will break the chain of Covid-19 virus. “There are many versions and opinions about lockdown and whether it will be instrumental in breaking he chain. However, it cannot be said so scientifically that clamping of lockdown will definitely break the chain. In fact, despite lockdown, there has been a rise in cases. This was experienced in Gujarat and other parts of the country as well,” Patel said in reply to a question whether lockdown was one of the options being considered to contain spread of the virus. “Many believe that if people wear masks, maintain social distancing and wash their hands regularly, then there is no need for a lockdown. Yes, a lockdown could be instrumental in breaking the chain, but it will impact the lives of thousands of traders and businessmen. Besides, there is no purpose of a partial lockdown if businesses and establishments are shut for part of the day ad open for the remaining time,increasing rush at these establishments,” the CM remarked. Commenting on night curfew, Patel said that night curfew has been clamped to ensure that people do not gather and idle around during night hours. “We have imposed night curfew to ensure that people don’t gather in large numbers to while away time. A complete lockdown has not been adopted by any state so far,” Patel said. He added that trade bodies in their individual capacity have been announcing voluntary closure, but the state government has still not issued any such directions. “In many smaller towns and other places, organisations and trade bodies have been voluntarily announcing closure for the weekend or other timings. The government has not issued any such directions yet,” Patel said. While cases have risen exponentially over the past days, the government has, over the past few weeks, been firm in its resolve of not considering any lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-proof-lockdown-breaks-the-chain/articleshow/82152186.cms||---

On Sunday night, thieves stole five cylinders from Shree Bal Krishna Coal Industry located near Aji GIDC in Nava Thorala. Police are worried over the possibility of the stolen items being sold in the black market as oxygen cylinders. The Covid-19 pandemic has led to paucity of oxygen cylinders. Desperate patients and their relatives, unable to get a bed at hospital are seen scampering around to get an oxygen cylinder that can be used in case of emergency. Police suspect that the thieves might have mistaken the nitrogen cylinders for oxygen ones. If these cylinders reach black market and some unsuspecting person, in urgent need of oxygen supply, buys them, it could lead to a tragedy. “Don’t purchase cylinders from unknown persons as thieves had stolen cylinders which are filled with nitrogen and if you come across such details, alert the police,” police posted on social media. Police are trying to obtain CCTV camera footage from nearby shops and factory units to get a clue about the burglars.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/cylinder-theft-causes-flutter-among-cops/articleshow/82150980.cms||---

The Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) announced that it would fight the civic polls in alliance with CPI, Congress, CPM and TDP are also working out seat-sharing for their alliances and BJP and Jana Sena have also tied up in the election. For 60 seats in KMC, polling will be held on April 30 and results would be out on May 3. As many as 404 candidates are in the fray. District minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar confirmed that TRS will have an alliance with CPI in the corporation elections and candidates would be announced on Tuesday. Sources said of the 60 seats, TRS will contest in 57 seats and leave three seats to CPI and one more seat from co-option members would also be given to the communist party. Interestingly, in the previous civic polls in Khammam, while TRS contested without any alliance and won 34, the CPI had an alliance with Congress and won two seats. Congress that had 10 seats in the previous council had decided to tie up with CPM and TDP. A formal announcement is expected on Tuesday, sources said. BJP and Jana Sena are yet to announce their seat-sharing. CPM had two corporators in the 2016 council and BJP did not get any seats. TDP contested in the last elections and drew blank. Party’s two MLAs from Khammam district Sandra Venkata Veeraiah and Mecha Nageshwar Rao joined the TRS recently. YSRCP, which has a considerable number of vote share in erstwhile Khammam district, contested in Khammam civic polls and won two seats. The party also had three MLAs and one MP (Khammam) in 2014 general elections for assembly and Lok Sabha. This time, the party is not contesting as it has stayed away from all the elections in Telangana for the past few years. Many of the YSRCP leaders later joined the TRS. Meanwhile, with only two days left for withdrawal of nominations i.e April 22, parties are planning to complete seat-sharing and announcement of candidates on Tuesday and start campaigning immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-bjp-congress-sew-up-alliances-for-khammam-polls/articleshow/82152007.cms||Koride Mahesh

This and some other important issues to combat the second wave of Covid-19 were discussed at a brainstorming meeting between the state government and senior railway officials at Nabanna on Monday. Home secretary H K Dwivedi, health secretary N S Nigam and transport secretary R K Sinha attended the meeting on behalf of the state government. The AGMs of Eastern Railway and South-Eastern Railway Aneet Dulat and Anupam Sharma represented the railways at the meeting that started around 11am and continued for one-and-a-half hour. The railways have been asked to prepare a draft SOP and submit it to the state government so that some additional guidelines can be formulated in the wake of the second wave of the pandemic. Sources in the state government said that the SOP adopted by the Maharashtra government may be followed here. “The latter has made it mandatory for all passengers coming from Delhi NCR, Kerala, Goa, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand to procure a Covid-negative certificate to enter the state. A similar formula is needed for our state since we are now recording more than 8,000 positive cases a day. This way the influx of other variants of Covid-19 can be prevented,” a state official said. “The railways and the state government may come up with a new set of rules, according to which passengers boarding long-distance trains may need to carry an RT-PCR negative test report with them. This test should be done within 48 hours of their train travel ,” he said. Among key issues discussed at the Nabanna meeting were sharing of data of passengers, migrant workers and the number of EMU locals and long-distance trains being operated on both railway zones. Railway officials said that the state government has told them that railway employees infected with Covid will have to be admitted in railway hospitals and not the state government hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-cov-rules-likely-for-train-travel/articleshow/82150984.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

There was some crowding in Raviwar Karanja and nearby market areas. The police had put up barricades to prevent vehicles from entering the market areas and had led to traffic jams on the Holkar bridge for some time. According to the shopkeepers, since the district administration had warned of a lockdown, people rushed to buy vegetables and groceries to stock up. This led to crowding in the markets. Even in the Satpur area — where the elected representatives had appealed to the grocery shopkeepers to keep their establishments closed for eight days beginning Monday — there was crowding. Traders opened their shops and people queued to buy grocery items here. BJP MLA Seema Hiray admitted that the appeal to close shops did not have any impact on traders and the local population. “We, the elected representatives cutting across party lines, had decided to observe a janata curfew from Monday. We had appealed to the traders and residents to voluntarily support the effort. But many grocery shops remained open in the Satpur division,” she said. All the traders’ associations and the Nashik Citizens’ Forum had also appealed to the traders and residents in Nashik city to observe the janata curfew, but many marketplaces in the city were open. “All grocery and grain wholesalers and retailers have curtailed the timings in a bid to break the chain of coronavirus.

Following the minister’s participation and address at the Rythu Vedika event in Ellanthukunta, ABVP workers staged a ‘rasta roko’ protest, obstructing the minister’s convoy. ABVP workers were agitating, demanding job notifications. The activists who were involved in the protest were taken into custody and brought to Ellanthukunta police station. While at the police station, TRS workers came in to lodge a complaint against the protesters and soon a clash erupted between the two groups, according to Sircilla DSP Chandra Sekhar. The vehicle of a TRS worker was damaged during the clash between workers of the two parties. Unable to control the mob, Ellanthukunta SI Mahesh Goud asked senior officials to intervene and send reinforcements. The situation was finally brought under control after tempers on both sides subsided. Police appealed to both groups not to resort to violence. “Around 20 to 30 ABVP workers came from other places in the state. We are in the process of identifying them all and cases will be registered,” the Sircilla DSP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/clash-erupts-between-trs-abvp-workers-in-sircilla/articleshow/82152154.cms||---

The crew had been subject to investigation and enquiries by various agencies. This was also the first time a photograph of the seafarers has been made available. General secretary and treasurer of Mumbai-based National Union of Indian Seafarers (Nusi) said the visit to Ever Given, now stationed at Lake of Great Distress, was facilitated by the London-based International Transport Workers Federation (ITF). “Representatives of a local affiliated trade union of seafarers in Egypt boarded the ship and expressed solidarity on behalf of the ITF...This will come as a morale booster to the seafarers as they will know that the shipping community is concerned about their welfare. If they need any legal support, that may also be provided,” Serang, who is also the ITF vice-chair for south Asia, told TOI. The captain and crew onboard informed the two Egyptian trade union representatives that they had no problem regarding wages, food or provisions. “They fully understand the situation. Two seafarers — the second engineer and electrician are being signed off and their reliever will join soon which is a positive support from the Egyptian authorities. The crew are keen to resume sailing soon. The ITF team also delivered internet devices to the crew,” Serang said. It may be mentioned that the Ever Given was seized by the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) over the issue of the ship’s owner unwilling to pay a compensation of nearly one billion dollars for the revenue loss it suffered because of the vessel being stuck in the Suez Canal for six days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/indian-crew-aboard-ever-given-receive-visitors-for-first-time-since-ship-refloating/articleshow/82152249.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

Ashes of some were kept in pots while others had been tied in cloths and kept there.Some of the ashes were tagged with the name of the deceased persons while others had none. It has come to light that the last remains of the deceased had accumulated at the crematorium over a period of time. These may include both Covid and non-Covid deaths.BJP city unit president Dr Vijay Shah said that looking at the situation the party decided to ensure that the ashes are immersed. Shah said that the reason for the ashes being left behind could be that the family members were in quarantine or were afraid of going to Chandod where immersions are conducted. He added that they came across 18 cases where family members had taken ashes home, but did not get an opportunity to cremate them.According to the city BJP chief, the ashes of all unknown persons were kept in a large urn while those of known persons were kept in different smaller urns. Necessary rituals were performed on the urns and these were then taken to Chandod. The ashes were immersed in the Triveni Sangam at Chandod with dignity. The city unit of the BJP has taken up a series of initiatives during the recent times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/ashes-piled-up-at-crematorium-immersed-at-chanod-by-bjp/articleshow/82151011.cms||---

Mohol said there is now a widespread shortage of the vaccine in Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits. He added that Tuesday’s vaccination drive will continue at hospital sites that have some Covishield left. “I have been informed that around 9,000 Covishield doses are available at government and private vaccination centres for Tuesday,” he said. When told about the low reserves, he said if the Covishield stock lands early on Tuesday, it would be immediately dispatched to all centres. A PMC official said there are 9,000 Covishield doses available with the civic body. But the official was unable to confirm if this reserve was actually available for use or the result of stale data not updated by vaccination centres. The District Health Office (DHO) report on vaccine stock on April 19, a copy of which is with TOI, stated the PMC only had 16,663 doses of Covishield available with it on Monday morning. The daily vaccination report on Monday evening stated that 16,180 people were administered Covishield, effectively leaving a balance of only 483 doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/new-doses-may-arrive-by-noon-today-mayor-mohol/articleshow/82151005.cms||Piyush Bhusari

---||Kolkata||Complexes set to house support staff to contain infection spread||Kolkata : With the state already in the grip of Covid-19’s second wave and daily cases of infections hitting new highs in the city, residents wonder whether it is enough to stop delivery men, relatives and friends from entering housing complexes, if the housekeeping, security staff and technicians are allowed to come in and leave daily. They are in favour of dividing the strength into two or more batches and keeping them housed in for a fortnight and then calling in the second batch after releasing the first one. Meetings are on to finalise the logistics as in some complexes, the number of support staff is as high as 250 and housing them together requires massive arrangements. Some complexes said that the facilities that were set up last year would be replicated and it would take just a couple of days to bring them back in place. Committees said that over the past three to four days there has been a sudden spurt in Covid cases and from three to four families, now 15 to 35 families have been affected. They want committees to swing into action and cut off all outside contact, thus pondering the idea of keeping support staff within the complex area. “My father is in hospital and there are many in our complex who have been affected. The committee has already decided to bar entry for delivery men and we have suggested that the support staff be kept in too,” said Sagar Daryani, a resident of Urbana. The president of the complex, Sujit Bhattacharya said that a decision would be arrived at in the next couple of days because a huge mechanism has to be put in place to house 250-odd staff members. Silver Spring committee has also discussed the matter in a remote meeting of board members. “The facilities that were put in place to house the support staff within the campus, still exist and we can activate it within a few hours,” said spokesperson Indranil Chowdhury. The community hall and games rooms of the middle income group blocks of Upohar Complex are getting readied to house the security guards, housekeeping staff and technicians, in the same way it was done last year. “We are taking no chances and have arrived at a decision to once again keep at least 15 of the staff inside the campus. Their needs will be taken care of,” said Satyendra Prasad, a spokesperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/complexes-set-to-house-support-staff-to-contain-infection-spread/articleshow/82151006.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Chandigarh||Dress code rips apart Kharar MC president poll as Congress sniffs SAD plot||MOHALI: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Congress councillors allegedly clashed with each other during the elections for president and senior vice-president of Kharar municipal council on Monday, leading the polls to be postponed to May 3. “A report will be submitted to the deputy commissioner for appropriate action against the guilty,” said sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Himanshu Jain, who along with his administrative staff had to escape through the back door as a crowd headed towards him in anger. Councillors exchanged blows, hurled abuses and threw chairs and tables on each other. Later, police was called and the situation was controlled. The fight stemmed from Congress allegation that SAD councillors forcefully influenced independent councillors to vote for their candidates, “forcing them to wear saffron colour shirts” to enter the committee room, the election site. Jain said the Congress alleged SAD councillors changed the minds of independent councillors and forced them to wear saffron clothes. On the other hand, Kharar SAD in-charge Ranjit Singh Gill, said, “It was a planned move of the Congress. We were having 15 councillors on our side and all of them were wearing saffron colour clothes as a dress code. Congress councillors abused our councillors and threw chairs on us. We request the authorities to check the video footage. Cases should be registered against the guilty. It is a total misuse of power by the Congress.” Kharar Congress in-charge and former cabinet minister Jagmohan Singh Kang said he was not aware of the incident but councillors were blaming Harinder Jolly for supporting SAD and luring independent councillors by offering money. At the same time, the elections for president and senior vice-president of Nayagaon council were also pushed to April 26 following a clash between two communities in Majri block.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dress-code-rips-apart-kharar-mc-prez-poll-as-cong-sniffs-sad-plot/articleshow/82150077.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Nagpur||Immediately release 10,000 vials of Remdesivir for Nagpur: HC to state||NAGPUR: Expressing disappointment over the disparity in Remdesivir drug distribution amongst various districts, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Monday directed Maharashtra government to immediately release 10,000 vials for Nagpur district by evening. On receipt of the vials, the division bench of justices Sunil Shukre and Shreeram Modak, asked collector Ravindra Thakare to make a fair and equitable distribution among all Covid hospitals in the district through their in-house pharmacies. “We direct the government and ministry of health and family welfare’s central drugs standard control organisation to place on record details about regulation of Remdesivir production and supply by the seven companies and its distribution amongst the various states. Also, the parameters followed by both respondents along with daily requirements placed by the state committee and other relevant details,” the court said. During an urgent hearing on applications filed by amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar and intervenor Dr Shailesh Kolhe through counsel Tushar Mandlekar, the bench further directed collector and NMC commissioner Radhakrishnan B to immediately set up dome-type Covid Care Centres (CCC) at GMCH, IGGMCH and AIIMS for the waiting patients, make them functional in seven days and also provide them drinking water. “There are several patients who are standing outside hospitals waiting for their turn. They are required to stand outside for days to come which results in deterioration of their health condition. The amount for setting up domes would be secured by the collector from the district planning committee (DPC) and mining and minerals funds with immediate effect,” the court said. Bhandarkar along with Mandlekar, M Anilkumar and others pointed out that on April 16, the government had allocated Remdesivir’s 5,328 vials for 2,664 beds in Thane, but distributed just 3,326 to Nagpur for 8,250 beds, thus leading to massive shortage and chaos. They informed that there was no allocation of this drug on April 13 and 18 and a short supply on April 17 and, hence, more vials should be released for the district. “The Covid scenario in Nagpur has turned to its worst ever. The situation is of the gravest order so much that there are no beds, lifesaving drugs and sufficient oxygen supply and also the dearth of medical and paramedical staff,” the judges said. Extend food delivery timing for hotels, authorities told The HC directed the collector, NMC chief and police commissioner Amitesh Kumar to permit the restaurants to supply food beyond the stipulated time of 8 pm.“There are complaints that all family members are infected with the virus and they need to depend on outside food, as they’re sick. But due to curfew, they can’t avail food services after 8 pm. This is genuine difficulty. The supply of food to the patients is also an essential service,” the judges said. Report sought on using rly rakes for Covid patients The judges asked NMC chief to consider requisitioning railway hospital rakes which are already equipped with oxygen beds for Covid-19 patients. Railways counsel Nitin Lambat informed that there are 29 coaches having oxygenated beds which are lying idle at Ajni railway yard. “We direct NMC to submit a report before April 21,” the bench said before adjourning the hearing till 2.30 pm on the same day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/immediately-release-10000-vials-of-remdesivir-for-nagpur-hc-to-state/articleshow/82151083.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu scrambles to add oxygen beds||CHENNAI: Government medical college hospitals in Chennai on Monday struggled to increase oxygen beds amid a dearth of resources including doctors, postgraduates and nurses. The public too were hassled as information on bed availability in government hospitals wasn’t available in the public domain. The state Covid webpage showed that of the 116 government-enlisted private hospitals for Covid care, 91 updated their status until Monday. Of these, 28 reported an occupancy of 100% or more, while 31 had more than 70% occupancy. On an average, 70% of oxygen beds across all private hospitals were occupied. No such information was available for government hospitals. Director of medical education Dr R Narayanababu said no patient was turned away. “But since many are asking for information about government hospitals, we are working towards putting it up on the portal.” Information from the covid control room at the Directorate of Medical Education showed that by 3pm, nearly 72% of beds in five government hospitals were occupied. The occupancy was at 36% in health centres and 12% at Covid Care Centres. Most patients in the four medical college hospitals and Government Covid hospital in Guindy have moderate or serious illness requiring oxygen. At the Guindy hospital, 250 of the 550 beds are oxygen beds. The government plans to add another 150 beds here. On Monday, staff at the 3,628-bed Rajiv Gandhi Government General Gospital were dragging oxygen pipelines to more than 150 beds. “We had set aside 1,618 beds as isolation beds for Covid treatment. Of this, a little more than 850 are oxygen beds, and they are all taken. We are adding oxygen pipelines to more beds,” said dean Dr E Theranirajan. Converting a bed into oxygen bed is more than just civil work. “We have adequate oxygen capacity to convert almost all beds to oxygen beds. But it’s not just about dragging the gas pipe,” said a senior Stanley Medical College and Hospital (SMCH) professor. “We have to match it with human resources.” Of the 1,200 designated for Covid care at SMCH, 750 are oxygen beds. “Nearly a third of all our postgraduate students are not working because they have exams. Last year, several doctors, nurses and paramedical staff were posted or deputed to city hospitals. We don’t have them this year,” he said. Of the 380 nurses at SMCH, 10-15 are posted to manage wards where there are senior or vulnerable patients with moderate/severe illness. Health officials said facilities will be ramped up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-scrambles-to-add-oxygen-beds/articleshow/82151012.cms||---
---||Agra||Agra running out of medical oxygen, most ambulances halt services & hospitals send out SOS||AGRA: At least 21 serious patients were “forcibly” discharged by private hospitals in Agra after they ran out of medical oxygen while the district’s government hospital taking the maximum Covid-19 patient load has sent out an SOS to the government saying that its oxygen stock was depleting and may not last another 24 hour. UP’s chief minister Yogi Adityanath has on Sunday asked officials to ensure a minimum 36 hours of oxygen backup in hospitals. A senior doctor at SN Medical College said, “Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and ventilators cannot be operated using oxygen cylinders. These machines need high pressure supply of oxygen. The oxygen tank is almost empty. State authorities have been informed. The crucial machines used in treatment of critical patients can stop working anytime.” At least 469 fresh cases of Covid-19 were reported on Monday while four persons died due to the disease. The scarcity of oxygen has also adversely affected the crucial ambulance services in the city. According to an estimate, over 75% ambulances have come to a halt due to the shortage of oxygen. Of the 250 registered ambulances in the district, at least 175 have stopped fetching patients due to lack of oxygen. State secretary of the ambulance owners-drivers association, Ravi Sishodiya, said, “Over 175 ambulances were not able to operate on Monday due to non-availability of oxygen. In the current situation, almost 99% of patients need oxygen support during the transportation. Besides, it is taking at least 2 to 3 hours in admitting the patients as ICU beds are not available in most of the hospitals. We cannot take a chance of carrying a patient without oxygen support.” The 18 private hospitals in the city given permission to take Covid-19 patients were also running short of the live saving chemical element. According to sources, some private hospitals on Monday asked at least 21 Covid-19 patients to leave after they ran out of the medical oxygen. Some were in ICU. While some of them got admission in SN Medical College, others were still out in the lurch. Senior member of IMA’s Agra unit, Dr Ravi Mohan Pachori, said, “Following the surge in Covid-19 cases, the demand for medical oxygen has increased multiple times in the last one week. Most hospitals involved in the treatment of Covid-19 patients are not getting enough oxygen supply. It will be difficult to save patients in critical condition without oxygen. We have updated the district administration about the situation. Hospitals have been asked to ensure minimum usage of oxygen and extensively use oxygen concentrators.” Agra’s chief medical officer Dr RC Pandey said, “We are making all efforts to ensure that hospitals do not suffer from short supply of oxygen. The supply has not stopped. But it is very less. The district administration has stopped supply to industries so that hospitals get it. Drug administration has been directed to prepare a list of all the suppliers and communicate with them so that the gap in demand and supply does not occur.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-running-out-of-medical-oxygen-most-ambulances-halt-services-hospitals-send-out-sos/articleshow/82150097.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Pune||From July, big boost in shots availability||Pune: Vaccine availability in India will significantly improve by July, with the ramping up of domestic production and arrival of foreign jabs, a top official has said. Dr Vinod Paul, member of the Niti Aayog and chairman of the empowered group on Covid management, said relaxation of norms will let the country fast-track greenlighting of foreign-made vaccines that have received emergency-use approvals. He added that production of both Covaxin and Covishield is also being scaled up. “We are expecting current production levels of Covaxin and Covishield to be scaled up, as has been committed by their manufacturers (Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute). We also expect Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson to seek Indian licence as soon as possible,” Dr Paul said. The Russian-made Sputnik-V vaccine is also likely to be available in India after May. Some of these foreign-made vaccines need very low storage temperatures — from -25°C to -70°C. Dr Paul said, depending on approvals, the shots can be deployed in urban centres.  He said, “The first 100 beneficiaries of these foreign vaccines will be assessed for a week for safety outcomes, before the shots are rolled out as part of the larger Covid immunization programme in the country.” The addition of more vaccines to India’s basket will let the government cover more age groups, Dr Paul added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/from-july-big-boost-in-shots-availability/articleshow/82151015.cms||Nisha Nambiar

She was a participant in the Quit India movement and was in Viyyur jail for two years for picketing Madras secretariat. After she was released from jail, she returned to Anakkara and joined the Congress party and worked for the empowerment of women. Though Susheelamma, as she is fondly called by family members and local people, is ill due to old age, she maintains the tharavadu that gave birth to some of the great personalities of this country. When Susheelamma became a centenarian, the ancestral home at Anakkara, a nalukettu of architectural beauty near Koottanad in Palakkad district, also completed 125 years. The members of Vaddakkath Tharavadu, including great freedom fighters, political leaders, artistes of high order, scientists and legal luminaries, have spread across the world. Ammu Swaminathan (freedom fighter and member of constituent assembly), her sister A V Kuttimalu Amma (freedom fighter and close to Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru), Ammu Swaminathan’s daughters Captain Lakshmi and Mrinalini Sarabhai, a famous dancer who married Vikram Sarabhai (regarded as the architect of Indian space programme), Sarabhai’s daughter and another renowned dancer Mallika Sarabhai, Captain Lakshmi’s daughter and former MP Subashini Ali, Srilatha Swaminathan, A V Achuthan, A V Govinda Menon, A V Sankara Menon, A V Kuttikrishna Menon are some of the distinguished members of the Vaddakkath Tharavadu. Its eminent son-in-laws include Kozhipurathu Madhava Menon, freedom fighter and minister in Madras state, who was the husband of A V Kuttimalu Amma. Since Vadakkath Tharavadu has a long tradition and history, the junior family members wanted to preserve this architectural marvel. However, with the only surviving senior member crossing 100 years and bedridden for most of the time, the upkeep of the ancestral home remains a concern.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/freedom-fighter-of-vadakkath-tharavadu-turns-100/articleshow/82150098.cms||---

The decision comes at a time when the state is reeling from a surge in Covid-19 cases as the healthcare infrastructure struggles to cope. The final semester regular and remedial summer 2021 exams will be conducted in the online MCQ format, the university announced in a circular on Monday. As many as 75,000 students are expected to take the online exams. “We are planning to conduct the online exams early so that students who want to pursue further studies, including overseas, can do so,” said GTU vice-chancellor Navin Sheth. The university will also hold exams in the offline format later. The offline exams, also in the MCQ format, will be for only those students who are not able to take the pre-check trial test or the online MCQ exams due to technical issues, said Sheth. The external exams or ‘viva summer 2021’ for all courses/semesters shall be conducted by internal faculty members of respective institutes except for architecture design and architecture studio design for BArch, and dissertation subjects of ME and MPharm courses. Also, the online exams for these few courses will be conducted by the university. GTU’s decision comes at a time when another large university in the state, Gujarat University, could not find many takers for its online exams. GTU had last year set a precedent among other universities in the state by successfully conducting semester exams online amid the Covid-19 pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/75000-students-likely-to-take-gtus-online-exams/articleshow/82155798.cms||---

Though vaccination at these centres for general public was restricted to the morning to evening slots, healthcare and frontline workers would extensively avail the late night vaccination facility. A PMC official told TOI, “On instructions from the higher-ups in the civic body, we have stopped 24x7 vaccination at these five hospitals after the strict curbs imposed recently. Those who want to get vaccinated can now go to these centres from 8am till 10pm. It was felt that the 24x7 facility could have been misused during restricted hours by people moving out on the pretext of getting the shot at such hospitals.”There would be a rush of beneficiaries till as late as 1am. Many healthcare and frontline workers would visit the centres at night. However, round-the-clock vaccination here was stopped to preclude rush at a time when all have been advised to stay at home, the official said.PMC officials said this is unlikely to have an impact on the vaccination drive as the number of centres has increased recently.An official from Kamla Nehru Hospital told TOI, “Per day vaccinations at the centre are the same now after 24x7 facility was stopped as they were before, 800 beneficiaries on an average.” An official from the Rajiv Gandhi Hospital said, “Beneficiaries can now come for vaccination from 7am till 9pm.”Sanjay Patil, chairman of Hospital Board of India, and Indian Medical Association, Pune, said, “Stopping the 24-hour vaccination is not prudent when mass vaccination is most needed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/curbs-halt-late-night-vax-drive-in-five-city-hospitals/articleshow/82151007.cms||Neha Madaan

Madhukant Garad, the secretary of the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) and the chief administrator of the Market Yard, told TOI, “Only 500 of our total 1,000 shops will operate on an alternate basis from Wednesday to reduce crowding. At least 15,000 people visit the market yard every day and we expect this number to shrink to half from Wednesday.” A decision to operate the market yard at 50% capacity was taken by the APMC after Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta visited and reviewed the crowd management measures at the market yard. “We witnessed overcrowding at the venue on Monday and hence directed the APMC authorities to change the system,” Gupta told TOI. APMC secretary Garad said, “Since the market will function on all days, barring Saturday and Sunday, there won’t be any issue of intake of vegetables and fruits.” Veggie supply to hotels & eateries dropsThe Market Yard authorities on Monday reported a drop in the quantum of vegetable, fruits and agri-product supplies to hotels and eateries. They, however, said the collection of the items from the local markets (mandis) was stable. The drop in supplies to hotels and eateries was mainly on account of the restrictions on dine-in facility at these establishments, the authorities said. “On an average, 3-4 tonnes of vegetables are supplied to hotels and eateries each day, which has come down significantly now. Vegetables like cauliflower, cucumber, tomato and pumpkin, among others, are finding few takers. Over a tonne of these vegetables are still at Market Yard and will be sold on Tuesday auction,” said B B Bibwe, head of the onion and potato section of the Market Yard. After two days of the weekend lockdown, the authorities reported a glut in the arrival of vegetables and fruits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/market-yard-to-work-at-50-capacity-from-tomorrow/articleshow/82151025.cms||Sandip Dighe

While there has been no official notification regarding the proposed march, senior SKM leader Gurnam Singh Charuni and Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee president Satnam Singh Pannu on Monday claimed that it has been cancelled while morcha leaders Ashish Mittal and Yogendra Yadav told media persons that it will be undertaken at an appropriate time. The march was initially planned for February 1, but was deferred indefinitely after the January 26 happenings. On March 31, after the SKM meeting, Haryana farmer leader Charuni had announced that it would be undertaken in the first fortnight of May and the date will be decided later. Now, sources claim, as there is no unanimity among the morcha constituents, the march has been cancelled. When contacted, Charuni said, “I was all for undertaking the march, but many were not in its favour. So, it has been cancelled”. Pannu said if cancelled, it may hit the credibility of the morcha. Once the announcement is made, the morcha must stick to it, he said. “Now, it should clarify if this decision has been taken. If so, then why has it been taken and why no announcement?” he said. In the April 17 meeting, the strategy for the proposed march was to be discussed, but the decision was taken against it and the SKM must review the decision, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/farm-outfits-divided-on-plan-for-parliament-march/articleshow/82151029.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Pune||Pune: Inter-state bus movement at a standstill over restrictions||PUNE: Transporters said inter-state movement of buses from Pune has stopped for over a week because of poor passenger load, stringent travel regulations introduced by several states and the police stopping buses at the border districts. Anand Lohe, a transporter, who has a fleet of eight buses that ply to and from Goa, said it has been almost a week now since all inter-state bus movements shut down. “There was some passenger traffic a day after the chief minister announced fresh restrictions. But since then, everything has stopped. Apart from lack of passengers, the regulations on travel is among the main reasons why people are not ready to travel. Moreover, there have been instances of police stopping private buses at the border districts such as at Ratnagiri. Private buses can ply during the restrictions, but the police don’t listen to the drivers,” Lohe said. Buses from Pune ferry passengers to Goa, Karnataka, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, among others. Apart from the private buses, the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) also has inter-state services to Goa, Gujarat, Karnataka. A total of 500 private buses used to ply to and from Pune to neighbouring states each day, a transporter said. Senior officials of the MSRTC’s Pune division said their inter-state transport has stopped completely. “It is mainly because of disappointing passenger traffic. Our intra-state transport has also been affected. At present, there are no MSRTC buses plying to other states,” Dnyaneshwar Ranavare, the divisional traffic manager of the Pune division, told TOI. Balasaheb Khedekar, president of the Pune Luxury Bus Association, underlined the hassles because of police checking. “The state government has not stopped the movement of buses. While less number of passengers is a worry, the police are creating problems at the borders. They tend to stop the private buses from plying saying that it is not allowed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/inter-state-bus-movement-at-a-standstill-over-restrictions/articleshow/82151019.cms||Joy Sengupta

As on April 18, the city had 25,011 active cases. City-based Covid data analyst Vijayanand said the doubling period for Chennai stood at eight days. If the present trend continues, there will be 50,000 cases in a week. “For entire TN, the doubling time is nine days and the cases, at this rate, will touch one lakh in the next six days.” At present, Greater Chennai Corporation has more than 1,500 people in Covid care centres and even if 80% are in home isolation, the numbers in the coming weeks will be ery high and hospitals will be overwhelmed, said experts. Infectious diseases expert Dr S Subramaniam said the problem is that the state has not upgraded the process, and the protocol used in March 2020 is being followed now. “We need to make quick decisions. Earlier only a few, mostly elderly, were symptomatic. Now, after one person in a family tests positive, almost all his/her contacts are testing positive, most of them youngsters and symptomatic. We cannot give them home isolation as it is risky,” he said. With the current surge in cases, the trend of oxygen bed occupancy must be monitored, said Dr P Ganesh Kumar, assistant director at National Institute of Epidemiology. Data on proportion of active cases under oxygen support will help project the number of oxygen beds which would be filled with current increase in cases. Corporation officials said that in the current surge more youngsters are getting affected. “For every positive case, a minimum of six contacts are being traced. The problem is all of them are testing positive. Last year, only symptomatic were tested and most of them tested negative. The entire trend has changed,” said an official. The civic body has 12,600 beds in Covid care centres and is prepared to scale up the number to 20,000. “But we are aware this won’t be enough,” he said. Dr Subramanian said bed shortage was far worse than last year because of the number of youngsters requiring hospitalization. “I have two pregnant mothers in ICU now. We have no new protocols on treatment as we are still following the older one.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/citys-18-positivity-rate-worries-experts-doctors/articleshow/82151022.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||Take steps to check impure water in schools: NGT to Pb||Times News NetworkChandigarh: After finding the drinking water of around 86 schools of Ludhiana district contaminated, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has ordered the Punjab government to take remedial action to prevent pollution of water.“Needless to say that steps are required to be taken to prevent pollution of water and pending such steps, wherever water is contaminated / safe, there is need to take steps for providing safe drinking water. This is the primary obligation of the state,” observed the tribunal.The NGT further directed the chief secretary, Punjab, to look into the matter in coordination with the departments concerned, ascertain the causes of contamination and take remedial action for ensuring supply of safe drinking water in the interest of public health. “A meeting with the departments concerned for the purpose may be held within a month and action taken as per the decisions,” the NGT order stated. The NGT bench—comprising Justice A K Goel, chairperson, Justice Sudhir Agarwal, judicial member, and Nagin Nanda, expert member —passed these orders while disposing of an application filed by advocate H C Arora.Grievance in the application was against failure to take remedial action to check pollution of water and providing potable water in areas of Punjab where the available resource is polluted. The applicant had—on the basis of information obtained through RTI — stated that water available in Punjab government schools, drawn from submersible pumps, is not fit for drinking. On test, it is found exceeding the laid-down parameters of alkalinity, hardness, calcium and total dissolved solids (TDS). The bench observed that as per RTI information, water of 63 government schools of Ludhiana district is found exceeding the laid-down parameters. The NGT said water being supplied through submersible pumps to children of 23 other government schools in the district is found to have bacterial contamination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/take-steps-to-check-impure-water-in-schools-ngt-to-pb/articleshow/82150116.cms||---

Extension in curfew timings, closure of all bars, cinema halls, gyms, spas, coaching centres, sports complexes and allowing restaurants and hotels only takeaways and home deliveries from Monday to Saturday have made the people associated with these businesses anxious. Besides, all shops have been ordered to remain shut on Sunday. Capping the number of persons at weddings to 20 will hit the hospitality industry hard. Amarveer Singh, president of Hotel and Restaurants’ Association of Ludhiana, said, “No doubt the coronavirus situation is bad right now, but I don’t think the restrictions will help curb cases. These have been imposed only on the hospitality industry while rest of the businesses, be it malls, shops, private offices, factories, have been allowed to operate from Monday to Saturday. This means the government thinks that corona cases only spread in hotels, restaurants and marriage palaces. We are fed up of these restrictions and it will be better for us to close our businesses permanently and hand over the keys to the government.”Shiv Shankar Rai, owner of a hotel and general secretary of Punjab Tent Dealers and Welfare Association, was also livid. He said, “These restrictions are a setback to hotels, restaurants, marriage palaces, caterers and banquet halls, where many parties were booked before the government capped the number of guests. On the other hand, curfew will now start from 8pm instead of 9pm, so we will get less time to organise events. All these factors will cause huge losses and our clients will also suffer as they have already distributed invites.” Cinema hall and multiplex owners may not be affected by fresh bans as they were already having a poor business. Varinder Singh Chawla, owner of a multiplex, said, “The cinema halls have been ordered to be closed till April 30, but it will hardly have any impact as already there was no footfall. Due to the fear of coronavirus, people were not coming to watch movies on big screens. Our losses are already at their highest level, and it is better for us to keep cinema halls closed till a revival scheme is introduced by the government for our industry.”Most of the city coaching centres have already been operating online. Speaking to the TOI, Ashish, an executive at a coaching centre located in Dugri, said, “In the wake of the second wave of coronavirus, we started operating online. We will not run the centres till further orders from the government.”Gym owners and workers are also tense. Sangeeta Sharma, a gym trainer, said, “In the past two months people had started coming back to the gyms and we were seeing a glimmer of hope. We thought we would be able to reduce our losses, but the order of closure till April 30 has dealt us a big blow.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/livelihood-at-stake-fresh-cm-order-has-city-on-tenterhooks/articleshow/82150106.cms||Mohit Behl

Researchers of the Archeological and Historical Conservation forum in Nedumkandam who discovered the “hero stone” said that such a discovery has been made for the first time in south India. “The one-foot stone has the carving of a hero sitting on an elephant with a bow and other weapons in his hands. He has worn ornaments on his ears and neck. The stone depicts a hero with a raised sword in his right hand. Another person and animal form is seen nearby and it was obscure,” said Nedumkandam archeological forum member Dr Rajeev Puliyoor. According to researchers the “hero stone” was discovered below the hill on the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border at the base of a banyan tree at Chathurangapara. The place is geographically very important on an ancient trade route from Kerala to Madurai that is over two thousand years old. This hero stone is another example of the mysterious history of the high range area. Historian and former vice-chancellor of Mahatma Gandhi University Rajan Gurukkal said, “It is difficult to date the hero stones without inscriptions or firearms, for the practice of erecting them in the deep south had been common since the Iron Age. They were installed as anthropomorphic memorial stelae in relief design for fallen heroes since very old times. Tamil heroic poems help us associate them with pastoral heroism of cattle raids. The practice continued even into the late 19th century. Keeping in view of the relief features, the hero stone of Chathurangapara appears to be of 15-16th centuries.” Earlier, for the first time in south India, petroglyphs (carvings on rocks) similar to Indus script on megalithic-era menhirs were found at Chakkakkanam near Nedumkandam in Idukki in 2019. Last year, prehistoric stone monuments were discovered in the catchment area of Anchuruli in Idukki dam reservoir. The 2,500-3,000 year old megaliths, including menhirs, were found after the water level receded in Pezhumkandam in Anchuruli. “The headstone is a good proof that Idukki was inhabited centuries ago. This evidence also reminds us that the high range claims another unrevealed history,” said Puliyoor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ancient-hero-stones-found-at-chathurangapara-in-idukki/articleshow/82150139.cms||Sandeep Thomas

The number of active cases rose to 2,653, the highest ever since the outbreak of the pandemic. The sample positivity rate which was less than 2% in March increased to 7.68%. Besides, four Covid patients succumbed on Monday. The health department claimed that they died of co-morbidity. With a massive surge in the number of cases, the health services remained largely affected. Patients in critical condition were not able to get ICU beds. The emergency ward at the SN Medical College was fully. Two patients were lying on several beds. Meanwhile, the staff at crematoriums had their hands full as unprecedented number of bodies were brought for cremation. Punit Verma, a Lohamadi resident, said, “My uncle had fever for the past two days. On Sunday night, he started complaining of difficulty in breathing. We made rounds of several hospitals to get him admitted but ICU beds were not available. He died waiting for treatment.” Chief medical officer of Agra district, Dr RC Pandey, said, “In the last 24 hours, only four Covid-19 patients have died in Agra district. We are increasing the number of ICU beds.” Covid appropriate behavior was strictly being enforced and people who had come in contact with Covid patients were being tracked and screened. “Random testing is being conducted in different parts of the city,” said Pandey.

Pastor Baljinder Masih along with his followers was performing prayers around 9 pm, when Lakhmir Singh, a farmer, started harvesting his crop on his land adjoining the worshipping place, said a police official. As the harvester started emitting dust and making a lot of noise, the pastor approached Lakhmir to defer harvesting for 45 minutes. He refused, resulting in heated arguments and a fight in which sticks and sharp-edged weapons were used Pastor and Lakhmir had an old enmity over some land dispute, sources said. The injured were admitted to civil hospitals in Kurali and Phase VI, but all are out of danger, police said. On Monday, the pastor and his supporters protested at Majri block.

Recording the submission, the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy directed the state to take immediate steps to ensure that such counters are accessible to persons with disabilities. The bench passed the interim order on a PIL moved by Meenakshi Balasubramanian, a disability rights activist, seeking to add disabled persons to the priority group for the administration of Covid-19 vaccine. According to the petitioner, disabled people, due to their unique characteristics, are incapable of maintaining social distancing and wearing masks. Mortality rate among disabled people is reported to be higher than other age groups, she said. “Disabled people face three increased risks with devastating consequences – the risk of contracting Covid-19, developing severe symptoms from Covid-19 or dying from the disease, as well as having poorer health during and after the pandemic, whether or not they are infected with Covid-19,” the petitioner said. Blind persons are more reliant on their sense of touch as a substitute for impaired vision. One of the major routes of the virus transmission is believed to be via contact and hence this group is at a higher risk, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/vax-depots-for-disabled-soon-tn-tells-hc/articleshow/82151037.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

These ‘combing’ operations have started in areas where the new cases continue to be higher. As many as 64 specialised teams have been formed for these ‘combing’ operations. These teams have trained staff members who are expert in tactfully questioning the residents to get out details of suspected patients. These teams have also been instructed to aggressively follow up with the suspected cases. “There are certain areas where the infection rate is not coming down despite imposing curbs like declaring it a containment zone and regular testing. Hence, we started ‘combing’ these areas to identify infected people and start their treatment to stop further spread of the virus,” said Banchhanidhi Pani, SMC commissioner.The highest number of teams are currently deployed in the South Zone (12), West Zone (11) and Central Zone (10). Seven teams each have been deployed in South East Zone, South West Zone and North Zone.“These teams have members who can tactfully question the residents to extract details of family members or persons working in the commercial establishment or are suspected cases. These teams will continue monitoring the area till the number of positive cases drop to less than 5% of the total population in the area,” Pani added. According to SMC officials, this method has worked well in some pockets and therefore is being implemented in larger areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/restricted-zones-combed-to-trace-suspected-cases/articleshow/82151045.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

After receiving a result of the entrance test with details of their score and eligibility, they received a second, but rather different version of the report card. Mumbai University conducted online PhD entrance tests for various subjects from March 25-27, the results of which were declared on Saturday. However, law aspirants, who took the exam on March 27, claimed they received two results with different scores. “There was a technical glitch and we have told law aspirants that they must go by the second result,” said the university’s exam head, Vinod Patil. While some saw scores doubling from 30 to 60, catapulting them from ineligible to eligible for admission in a span of few hours, others found their scores drop from 48 to 43, but it didn’t matter as the minimum score for PhD eligibility is 50. Candidates said there was a software glitch during the exam, and several calls to the MU met with no response for some time.  “I had attempted questions totalling 60 marks when the software just did not load the next question. After several calls to the helpline, I was told to log out and sign in again. Merely 10 minutes were left and I could answer 20 questions,” said an aspirant. But these 20 questions were the same ones she had answered earlier. “I realised my session had restarted from the beginning, and not from where I had left off after the first 60 questions. I am unable to understand how I scored 49 if I attempted only 20 questions,” said the student, who missed the eligibility criteria by a mark. “I am not sure if the scores of the second session, when she logged in again, got recorded or not. There are very few students who are keen to pursue a PhD in law and most of them are serious candidates.

For passengers not carrying RT-PCR negative reports, the team is carrying out thermal scanning as well as Rapid Antigen Test (RAT). Around 700 passengers are expected to undergo the test daily. The state government had announced standard operating procedures (SOP) for passengers arriving by train from Kerala, Goa, Gujarat, Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), Rajasthan and Uttarakhand, described as places of “sensitive origin”. “Pune doesn’t have any train arriving from Kerala and Uttarakhand. However, there are daily, weekly and bi-weekly trains coming from Delhi, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Goa. Passenger checks started from Monday evening,” a senior rail official in Pune told TOI. “The trains coming from the above locations will be made to stop either on platform no. 6, 5 or 4. A proper signage system is being developed to guide these passengers in a queue to the new foot overbridge, where the PMC team will carry out the test,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-starts-testing-of-train-passengers-from-six-states/articleshow/82151034.cms||Joy Sengupta

However, a formal notification in this regard is yet to be issued and is expected in a day or two. Relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar also told mediapersons that CM Uddhav Thackeray will take a final call on complete lockdown in the next two days as current restrictions don’t seem to be serving their purpose and the desired effect in terms of reduction in cases is not being achieved. Officials from the relief and rehabilitation department said they expect restrictions on grocery shops to come into force from April 21 (Wednesday). “If the proposal is approved on Tuesday, it will come into force from Wednesday,” a senior bureaucrat said. Curfew has been in vain as cases still on the rise: MinisterThe state government will further restrict timings of grocery shops to four hours a day, from 7 am to 11 am. The decision on further curbs was taken in a review meeting chaired by deputy CM Ajit Pawar on Monday with some cabinet ministers and bureaucrats. It is likely timings of vegetable markets too may be restricted. On Monday, Nagpur district guardian minister Nitin Raut announced a reduction in timings for all essential shops in Nagpur, which will now remain open only from 7am to 11am. Only fruit and milk shops there will be allowed to stay open in the evening from 5.30pm to 7.30pm. A cabinet meeting will be held on Tuesday in which the Covid situation will be reviewed, and many ministers who are demanding a complete lockdown in the state will also be raising their issues. Restrictions on inter-district movement of people and vehicles are also not ruled out. “The results of restrictions have not been satisfactory as there has been non-cooperation from people. We will have to bring in a new strategy to halt any further surge,” a bureaucrat told TOI. “Law-enforcing agencies will have to act ruthlessly, otherwise the exercise of tackling the pandemic will be meaningless,” he said. Wadettiwar said, “The curfew has not served any purpose as cases are on the rise. This is not a complete lockdown. Many traders were against complete lockdown, but now traders, shops selling groceries, political parties and common people are demanding complete lockdown. This has been conveyed to CM and he will take a final decision after discussing with all ministers.” He further said a six-day lockdown was imposed in Delhi. “I have asked the department secretary to compile information about how they are managing services like Metro and concessions to be given for essentials during lockdown,” he added. In the meeting chaired by Pawar, he directed police authorities to ensure strict implementation of restrictions, increase checks and penalise violators. “From the feedback we are getting from police, the most common excuse given by people caught moving unnecessarily is they are going grocery-shopping. We will be issuing orders to restrict timings of grocery shops from 7am to 11am,” said public health minister Rajesh Tope who attended the meeting. “There is a need for strict implementation of restrictions till April 30,” Tope added.  To deal with the shortage of oxygen, district collectors have been empowered to give work orders for setting up of oxygen generation plants without waiting for the tendering process; a post-facto clearance from the cabinet can be taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-curfew-has-been-in-vain-as-cases-still-on-the-rise-says-min/articleshow/82152334.cms||---

The kits and masks were apparently thrown around by hospital staff after the cremation of Covid-infected bodies at Dhruv ghat — the only crematorium in the town where coronavirus-infected bodies are being cremated. According to Shashi Bhanu Garg of Dhruv ghat crematorium, their staff collect waste PPE kits which are lifted by municipal medical waste collection vehicle. “Sometimes their disposal gets delayed due to late arrival of the municipal vehicles. And, in the meanwhile, the kits get scattered,” he added. Covid-19 positive cases have been on the rise in Mathura with 454 people testing positive in the district on Monday. So far, 9,541 people were found to be Covid positive and 133 of them had died. In the district, two medical colleges — KD Medical College with 360 beds and KM Medical College with 220 beds — have been authorised to provide treatment to Covid patients free of cost. A private hospital, Nayati, has recently been authorised by the administration to provide treatment at the government-approved rates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/coronavirus-safety-gears-found-scattered-at-mathura-crematorium-pose-serious-health-risks/articleshow/82150147.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Heavy & unnecessary rush at HRCT centres a major worry, may aid Covid spread||PUNE: Heavy and avoidable rush of Covid patients at high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) centres across Pune district and the state has become a major concern, with cases hitting new highs almost every day. HRCT scan is required for assessing severity of the disease among moderate to severe (hypoxic) cases. “Patients need not panic once they test positive for Covid-19. Not every patient requires a HRCT scan. Let the doctors decide the time of the scanning and need for admission,” Dr Rajlaxmi Devkar, a member of the Indian Radiology Association, told TOI. Radiologists said asymptomatic patients or those with mild symptoms need home isolation and close monitoring of blood oxygen saturation with pulse oxymeter, besides certain blood tests for assessing immune response and coagulation profile. “Most patients in home care do not need HRCT scans, but they also crowd the centres, adding to the rush,” said a radiologist with a leading laboratory on Pune-Satara Road. A technician with a private laboratory, who did not wish to be identified, said at least 70-80 patients, accompanied by their relatives, were coming to the centre each day. “Even after telling them to come as per their time slots, they just don’t pay heed and wait nearby, adding to the rush and chaos,” the technician said. Medical experts said random crowding at HRCT centres only hassled the patients in real need of the scan. A Covid patient, who tested positive for the disease on Monday, could not get an appointment with a laboratory near Kondhwa and had to be rushed to a laboratory on Bibvewadi road, where he had to wait in a queue for almost an hour. “There were several Covid patients who were waiting for their turn there. This is highly risky,” he told TOI. The immediate past president of the state chapter of Indian Medical Association, Dr Avinash Bhondwe, said there was a rising trend among the home-isolated to get themselves tested for no real need. “There is a protocol to be followed. However, they rush to these places (HRCT centres), putting all at risk,” he said. The experts said a patient’s health condition, history of co-morbid conditions and age, among others, were to be carefully assessed before advising HRCT scan for thorax. Another doctor running a 35-bed Covid hospital on Satara Road said the rush at HRCT centres was a warning for spreading the disease. “Unless recommended, there is no need to go for CT scan,” he said. Dr Chandrashekar Sohoni, a radiologist in Kalyaninagar, said doctors should advise these scans in keeping with the clinical protocol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/heavy-unnecessary-rush-at-hrct-centres-a-major-worry-may-aid-covid-spread/articleshow/82151065.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Chandigarh||Amid Covid storm, farm front ready to bolster stir||BATHINDA: Amid imposition of lockdowns and harsher restrictions in view of the Covid pandemic, the Sanyukta Kisan Morcha — the farm front which is spearheading the agitation against the three farm laws — has decided to mobilise more protesters to the borders of Delhi. As part of this, SKM will be launching a ‘Resistance Week’ from April 24, when the protest on Delhi borders will complete 150 days. During the week, farmers will be asked to return to protest sites in large numbers, after they are done with wheat harvesting. In the meanwhile, another farm organisation, Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC), has decided to send jathas (groups) of farmers to the borders of Delhi on its own on April 20 and May 5. Earlier, BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) had announced to move towards Delhi borders on April 21. SKM leaders on Monday admitted to protests thinning out on the borders of Delhi due to harvesting season. They felt as harvesting was almost done, it was time for farmers to return to the protests. Morcha leader Ashish Mittal and Yogendra Yadav said BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) had already given such a call, so they decided to follow it too. KMSC general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher said, “Even though governments are trying to scare away farmers in the name of Covid or the supposed ‘Operation Clean’ for vacating protest sites, we are determined to continue protests till the central government does not repeal farm laws,” he said. BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri said farmers associated with their group were ready to move towards Delhi borders on Wednesday. “Many farmers who have harvested their wheat are getting ready to move,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/amid-covid-storm-farm-front-ready-to-bolster-delhi-protests/articleshow/82151064.cms||Neel Kamal

The state government has banned tourism in Kodaikanal and Nilgiris and also ordered closure of tourist spots from Tuesday onwards. “However, the district borders are not closed. People visiting the hill district on trade or medical purposes or on essential services will be allowed on producing relevant documents”, said Nilgiris collector J Innocent Divya. “Special teams will be deputed at the border check posts to check documents to ascertain purpose of visit to the district. Movements of essential services will be allowed,” she added. Protesting against the decision of the government, members of hoteliers association, cab drivers association and guides in Kodaikanal sat on a dharna at Moonjikkal. The protest lasted for more than three hours. The hoteliers and cab drivers warned of more protests if the government did not pay heed to their demands. A Abdul Kani Raja, secretary of Kodaikanal Hoteliers Association said, “We informed all the associations only at 10pm on Sunday about the protest through social media. But the response was overwhelming. People are agitated due to the travel restrictions to Kodaikanal as the economy here completely depends on tourism,” he said.  In Nilgiris, the Government Botanical Garden, Rose Garden, Ooty lake and Sim’s Park in Coonoor will remain closed till April 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tourism-barred-in-nilgiris-protest-in-kodai-against-ban/articleshow/82151058.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The supply has eased shortages to some extent, but quite a few hospitals said they were not allocated vials till late in the evening, despite being on the district administration's dashboard. There are now more than 1,00,000 active cases in Pune district. Some 25,000 patients have been hospitalised and the daily demand for remdesivir is now at 15,000 vials. Senior medical expert Chandrankant Kolte of Care hospital, Wagholi, said, "We have 60 patients admitted at our hospital. Despite being on the district administration's dashboard (meant for hospitals treating Covid), we did not get the drug for three days. On Monday, we got a few vials. We hope the supply remains uninterrupted." Wagholi resident Snehal Gulhane, whose husband is admitted at Care hospital, said, "We have been searching for remdesivir for the past two days. How can doctors treat patients if they don't have enough medicines?" The district administration had decided to allot remdesivir vials only to those hospitals whose names are on the its dashboard. But a discrepancy in the list of hospitals’ names provided by the PMC and district health officials has led to confusion in allotment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/remdesivir-vials-miss-some-hosps/articleshow/82151049.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Kaizen, which started on April 17, will be held till April 24. During this time, projects of final year students will be displayed online, and a jury of more than 90 renowned industrialists and academicians will judge them, so that they might be further taken up for patents and prototype in the near future, LDCE said.One of the projects on display at the event is called ‘Social Distancing Violation Detection’. The mobile-based app accurately measures the number of people and offers the necessary data and analytical solution to accurately manage a location’s permitted capacity and monitoring distance between individuals. Another project titled ‘Design of Innovative and Economic Covid Care Center’ aims at developing quarantine centres in different important locations to isolate infected people and curb the spread of virus. In the electric vehicle space, some students have submitted a project titled ‘Charging System of EV’ where they have built EV charger for small scooters. “It is able to deliver 48 volts, 2 amperes on the supply of stable single-phase 230 volts. It is a portable charger and an attempt has been made to keep it cheap and affordable,” the college said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/at-kaizen-apps-to-aid-covid-battle/articleshow/82152336.cms||---

He had been staying there for the last 17 days. The deceased man has been identified as Oleg Filippov. He was reportedly associated with aircraft maintenance and had arrived in India with his friend Aleksandr Khramtsov on April 2. Filippov came on a business visa which was issued on March 5 this year. It was valid for six months - till September 2021. According to police, the incident came to light when his friend Khramtsov, who was staying in the adjacent room, called him in the morning but did not get any response. He immediately informed the hotel staff, who called the police and when they opened the door, they found him lying unconscious in the washroom. The body has been sent for postmortem at SN Medical College, police said. When contacted, Sadar circle officer Rajeev Kumar said that prima facie it is a "natural death". "It could be anything. Cardiac arrest or brain haemorrhage, but the actual cause will be known only after the autopsy," Kumar added. Agra SSP Muniraj G told TOI that a panel of doctors will conduct the postmortem which will be videographed. The embassy has been informed, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/russian-engineer-55-found-dead-in-agra-hotel/articleshow/82150162.cms||---

While fresh orders have begun to dry up from buyers in states like Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, stocks of rayon fabric, woven, packed and ready for dispatch, are stuck due to the restrictions in industries up north. “Stock to the tune of several crores is stuck in the looms,’’ said B Kandavel, spokesperson of Erode Powerloom Owners Association . There are more than 25,000 powerloom units spread across Erode district, especially in Veerappanchathram, Chithode and Lakkapuram, employing roughly a lakh workers who manufacture about 24 lakh metres of fabric every day.  With night curfews on industries, there are very few orders now. “There is a fear that there could be more curbs, hence textile units are not willing to buy the fabric,’’ said M Somasundram, a powerloom unit owner. Due to the drop in demand, looms have cut short production by 50% this week, leaving workers in a state of uncertainty about prospects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/erode/stock-worth-crores-stuck-in-powerloom-units-in-erode/articleshow/82151067.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Twice bitten, Mohali gets 3rd tree pruning machine||Mohali: The municipal corporation (MC) has purchased another tree pruning machine at a cost of Rs 35.7 lakh, the third in a span of a few years — the first landed into a controversy and caused litigation and the second was grounded. Mayor Jeeti Sidhu said, “The machine will prune overgrown tree branches in the first phase on A and B roads. MC commissioner has been asked to identify such trees.” The machine can reach up to a height of 18.5 metre. It is fitted with electrically driven heavy duty chain saw mounted on a crane to reach tall trees, Sidhu said. A tractor worth Rs 6.4 lakh was purchased to be given to the horticulture department. The first machine was imported from Germany. A team from overseas had trained the employee of the company on operating it. The multipurpose machine had cost Rs 1.79 crore and was approved by SAD and Congress councillors in 2017. A rift between then mayor Kulwant Singh and MLA Balbir Singh Sidhu made it the reason behind fiery debates in MC house meetings before a local bodies department report termed the machine overpriced. It had been alleged that Kulwant Singh in connivance with the then commissioner, Rajesh Dhiman, and other officials had indulged in blatant misuse of his position and caused a loss of grave nature to the state exchequer while making the purchase of the machine. The machine was priced at Rs 28 lakh in the country while for making its purchase from abroad the price was Rs 80 lakh. But a resolution was passed for purchasing it at exorbitant price of Rs 1.79 crore, it was alleged. Kulwant had filed a defamation suit in the court and won the case. The second machine — a set of two — worth Rs 28 lakh was termed crude and was grounded after some time.

Till the post dinner walk on April 17, I had no clue what the next day would be like. But on April 18 I woke up with body-ache, heavy head and when I tested temperature it was 101. So, I went for rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests. As I was positive in rapid test and then in RT-PCR, the treatment began. I request all those who came in contact with me in last seven days to isolate themselves and get themselves tested. Since I have taken both the vaccination doses, I presume that I should be much better than the rest. Doctors have prescribed me some basic medicines. I am in home isolation and hope to be alright soon. CP office, the govt building where I operate from, has the highest hygiene and sanitation standards. Still I could not escape. Please don’t ignore your health. This virus is spreading faster. Shut yourself inside as much as you can at least this April.” He added, “I will keep updating you. Together we will bounce back.”Later, he posted on Ludhiana Police Facebook page that public can interact with the CP online via zoom from noon to 1pm, Monday to Friday.“If they find any difficulty in doing so, they can come to reception of CP office, Ludhiana, where a computer has been installed for their help. They can also email their complaints to cp.ldh.police@punjab.gov.in,” he added.Agarwal had taken the first dose of Covishield vaccine on February 3 and the second on March 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/month-after-second-vax-dose-top-cop-tests-ve/articleshow/82150156.cms||---
---||Chennai||Sailing from Chennai to Russia in just 24 days||If everything goes as per plan, giant oil tanker ships carrying crude oil or LNG may sail into Chennai from Vladivostok in Russia in a year. Two years after it was first mooted, Chennai Port Trust will start the process to identify a consultant this week to study feasibility of a Chennai-Vladivostok sea link via the Straits of Malacca and South China Sea, covering ports in Malaysia, Philippines and South Korea. A tender was floated in March and the technical bids will be opened on Friday. The commercial bids or final bids are expected to be opened on April 22. The consultant will study the route, its revenue potential, the goods that can be transported and other details in around four to five months after the contract has been awarded. The Eastern maritime corridor is shorter and ships will be able to sail to the destination in Russia in 24 days as against the longer route via Suez Canal and Europe. The main aim of the route is to import crude oil and LNG as part of the efforts to explore import options from countries other than those in the Middle East, said an official. ONGC Videsh has already started production in an offshore field off Sakhalin Islands in Russia. There is also scope for bringing coal, timber, machinery, agriculture produce, vehicles, tin, gold, diamond and other materials from Russia. Sources in the Chennai Port Trust said there are some cargo movements from Chennai to Vladivostok at present. This cargo passes through Visakhapatnam, Kolkata, Myanmar, Malaysia and reaches Suez Canal from there to the east coast of Russia. This also means that the cargo needs to be clubbed with those headed to other ports. So far there is no direct connectivity between Chennai port and the Russian ports. Hence it was proposed to take up the study to explore the possibility of improving the trade between the two nations. "We feel that if a study on this route is done, it will help in understanding the potential that it will provide to those in the trade. The study will also help in learning about the types of cargo that can be transported from Chennai to Vladivostok," said a senior official. The route is being prepared after Prime Minister Narendra Modi signed an agreement at Vladivostok in 2019. The proposed eastern maritime corridor will link ports of Chennai, Visakhapatnam and Kolkata with those of ports in Vladivostok, Vostochny and Olga in the east coast of Russia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/sailing-from-chennai-to-russia-in-just-24-hours/articleshow/82151075.cms||---

In the last one month, the number of Covid-19 cases have been on a rise across the state. In Telangana, Hyderabad has emerged as the epicentre for all the Covid-19 cases. Amid this, gated communities in the city, especially in the western corridor, are turning out to be hotspots due to laxity. “During Holi time, there were public events held within our community wherein food stalls, vendors selling apparels and household items were allowed. There were huge gatherings during that time wherein people didn’t follow social distancing norms,” said Pramod Kumar, resident of a gated community in Kukatpally. While few communities have put in place standard operating procedures for common areas and outdoor activities, many are dealing with residents who continue to flout norms related to masks and sanitisation. “The society has started informing people about the Covid-19 positive cases being reported within the community so that people are vigilant and follow all safety norms. Currently, we have about 83 cases in our community, many of which were reported only in the last 10 days,” said K Balaji, a resident of a gated community in Kokapet. Meanwhile, health wing of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) in the Serilingampally zone is in the process of identifying gated communities that have turned out to be hotspots in the last few weeks. “We are identifying gated communities in Hafeezpet and surrounding areas after 120 residents were tested positive in My Home Jewel recently. In most gated communities, allowing outsiders has led to the rise in Covid-19 cases. We have ramped up testing in gated communities. Some resident welfare associations have also set up internal isolation centers and are taking up sanitisation drives,” said Dr KS Ravi, assistant medical officer of health, Chandanagar circle, Serilingampally division.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/weekly-veggie-mkts-celebrations-turn-gated-communities-into-covid-clusters/articleshow/82151519.cms||Preeti Biswas

Many star hotels are signing up health workers and are offering quarantine and isolation packages to stay afloat in the coming months, even as a few hotels are offering staycations and work-from-hotel facilities. Industry sources said housing health workers and people who need quarantine is not a sustainable model as the hotel earns only Rs 2,000 to Rs 1,500 per room, but it would help prevent the hotels from lying idle. Vineesh Kurup, general manager, ibis Chennai City Centre and ibis Chennai Sipcot said, “The second wave has come as a shock to the hotel industry. ibis hotels have provided shelter to frontline healthcare professionals in the past and will aim to continue doing so.” Hotels have recorded dip in occupancy, cancellation of social functions and decline in patronage to bars because of night curfew and lockdown on Sundays. South India Hotels and Restaurants Association honorary secretary T Nataarajan said occupancy in star hotels has dropped in the city to 10% and 15%.” At present, star hotels have confirmed occupancy of long term guests and that number ranges from 5% to 10%. To ensure business, The Park and Ramada Plaza are among those offering quarantine and isolation packages. Sudip Sengupta, vice-president (operations), Green Park Hotels said work-from- hotel package would be explored.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hotels-offer-quarantine-stops-work-from-hotel-to-stay-afloat/articleshow/82151073.cms||---

He said that the clarification given by the college management was not convincing. “The college management termed it a mistake on part of the staff who failed to switch off the server and air conditioner. But, how can this happen when it is a daily routine?” he asked.Balaji raised objection as the room is adjacent to the building with strong room. He said the server or WiFi can easily work in adjacent buildings leaving room for malpractices. Balaji also said that he has written to the election commission seeking to double the number of benches in the counting centres on the day of counting to accommodate agents of each candidate. Balaji asked the returning officer to make arrangements for 28 benches since there are 77 candidates in the fray.“Additional benches will ensure that the counting process is expedited as each round of counting will take at least 45 minutes. We have sent a mail to state’s chief electoral officer Satyabrata Sahoo on the same,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/ban-use-of-electronic-equipment-near-strong-room-dmk/articleshow/82152382.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Colour-coded stickers pose practical hurdles, says activists||MUMBAI: Even as several motorists are being penalised for travelling without the mandatory colour coded stickers on their vehicles, activists have called for fair implementation. Motorists have been bombarding the police's Twitter handle with queries on which sticker should their vehicle sport if they are headed out to purchase groceries or pick up a family member from the airport. Motorists are also confused where to procure stickers from since shops stocking non-essential supplies have been ordered shut by the government. Structural engineer and activist Jamshed Sukhadwalla thinks the idea is good if it's implemented properly. "It can speed up essential personnel and medicinal supplies. I had texted my suggestion Police Commissioner Hemant Nagrale that a dedicated corridor could be created for vehicles that need to be given priority, such as those carrying oxygen cylinders and Remdesiver injections. If these vehicles get stuck in a snarl-up, it would be difficult to extricate them, and get them moving" said Sukhadwalla. His suggestion has been implemented at Dahisar check naka for vehicles sporting red stickers. The police notification specifies that any person using a vehicle in public needs to affix a sticker of six inch diameter on the front and rear screen of a vehicle and visible portion on a two-wheeler. "If you are going to the hospital or for vaccination, your vehicle needs a red sticker. For travelling to the airport or to the ATM, your vehicle needs a yellow sticker and for buying groceries, your vehicle needs a green sticker," clarified DCP S Chaitanya, spokesperson for Mumbai Police. "But there are practical difficulties. The mandated size of six inches may cause visibility issues for a driver. If this rule is meant to reduce snarls at check-nakas then only those drivers should be asked to carry stickers and show them, instead of applying the rule to all vehicles plying inside city limits,'' said activist and lawyer Armin Wandrewala, who has dashed off a letter to Nagrale enumerating the problems. On Monday, the traffic police challaned 1182 motorists for lockdown violations and seized 232 vehicles. AL Quadros of Mumbai Taximen's Union said several cabbies were penalised during the weekend for ferrying more than two passengers at a time. "Why should a family, whether arriving at the airport or railway termini, take two taxis when all three or four of them can travel in one cab safely to their destination. Our union has petitioned the state government, demanding a change in the rule," he said. Cops have also been penalising auto drivers who have not been vaccinated or those who do not have a Covid negative certificate. "I have written to the government to exempt drivers from this rule as it is difficult to get RT-PCR tests done every 15 days as there are long queues," said Shashank Rao of Mumbai Autorickshaw Men's Union. While autos and cabs need not sport colour coded stickers, some have been doing so voluntarily. "A banker is my regular passenger and to ensure his ride is uninterrupted, I have put up a yellow sticker," aggregator cab driver Iqbal Shaikh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-colour-coded-stickers-pose-practical-hurdles-says-activists/articleshow/82152384.cms||---

The work will start by the mid of May. Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL) will first issue the letter of intent to the company after it deposits a bank guarantee. “The board of directors went through all the aspects and assessed the second company too. It had failed to qualify owing to technical reasons. Finally, the green signal was given to allot the work according to the laid down norms,” an official said. The project has two components — capital work and installation of water meters. Around Rs 70 crore will be spent on capital work and the rest of Rs 90 crore on maintenance for 15 years. After the completion of the project, the engineering department of the municipal corporation will maintain the project. Members of the general house had taken this decision in February 2020. MC commissioner KK Yadav, who is also the chief executive officer of CSCL, had then brought the matter before the general house. There were two proposals. First, CSCL will do both capital work as well as handle the operations and maintenance and charge the bill. The second was that CSCL will do only capital work and MC will do the operation and maintenance of the project and charge the bill. Manimajra has 13,700 water connections, according to records of Chandigarh Smart City Limited. Decreasing the non-revenue water or water leakage from 50% to 15% is one of the major thrust areas. Besides pipelines in outer areas, the authority will also lay them in the houses to prevent water contamination||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/firm-cleared-24x7-water-supply-project-work-begins-from-may-15/articleshow/82150181.cms||Deepak Yadav

The businessmen living in these containment zones now cannot go to their factories until the restrictions are lifted. Offering a solution, father-son businessmen duo of Rajnish Ahuja and Rahul Ahuja of Rajnish Industries has offered the factory owners living in these containment zones a complimentary stay in their four-star hotel till the restrictions are lifted. About 20 rooms of their hotel have been earmarked for the purpose and Ahujas have broadcast the message in WhatsApp groups, drawing a huge response. Rahul, who is the former president of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Punjab, said, “As curfew-like situation prevails in Dugri, businessmen are restricted to their homes and unable to visit their factories, which cannot be run without their presence. Ever since Sunday when these areas were declared containment zones, there was panic among industrialists living there. My father and I thought of doing something for them. Industrialists living in these areas can take care of their businesses only if they move outside the containment zone. So, we decided to offer a complimentary stay in our hotel, Aagaaz, on Pakhowal Road. We have set aside 20 rooms that will be given on a first-come-first-serve basis. The only condition required for availing the stay is a corona negative report.”Rahul’s father Rajnish said, “As businessmen ourselves, we can understand their problems. Absence of the owner even for one day can take the business back by several weeks. They can make hotel rooms as their temporary homes from where they can go to their factories. Ever since we floated the message, we have got more queries than the number of rooms. As of now interested businessmen are also in touch with the authorities, seeking permission to move to the hotel. They can get approval and move in here any time.” Businessmen are hailing the gesture. Kulpreet Malhotra, a bicycle manufacturer and exporter, said, “The Ahuja family’s gesture is a great service to the business community. Allowing people to stay in their hotel will cost them a good deal of money, but they still extended a helping hand to the affected businessmen.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/hotelier-offers-free-rooms-to-bizmen-of-containment-zones/articleshow/82150173.cms||Mohit Behl

However, district health authorities rubbished the charges and claimed that when the deaths were reported within a span of few minutes the relatives of the deceased accused the hospital staff of medical negligence.  The state, meanwhile, vaccinated 76,005 people on Monday.

The state government presently comprises 27 legislators of BJP, five of Congress, three of GFP, one each of MGP and NCP, and three independents. A political observer said that even if Patnekar were to disqualify the 12 MLAs — thereby reducing the strength of the House to 28 — BJP would still have 15 MLAs who, along with the one independent MLA, would constitute a comfortable majority. The opposition comprises 11 MLAs while Benaulim NCP legislator Churchill Alemao supports the government on issue basis. Last week, Patnekar had issued notices to Congress president Girish Chodankar and MGP’s senior leader Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar, asking them to be present in his chamber on April 20 over the disqualification petitions. Advocate Cleofato Coutinho told TOI that if the speaker were to dispose of the petitions, either party could challenge his order before the HC or SC. “The chances of the speaker disqualifying the MLAs are very bleak — almost negligent. If the petitions are disposed of, they may have to be challenged as a year is left for the term of the House. Going by the track record, I do not expect any final decision before the next elections. That’s the problem with disqualification litigations,” he said. “In the unlikely event of the speaker disqualifying the MLAs, they may go to the SC via the HC to get a breather. But even if they all are disqualified, BJP will have the numbers in a reduced house.” In August 2019, Congress had filed a disqualification petition before the speaker against the 10 MLAs— Chandrakant Kavlekar, Isidore Fernandes, Nilkanth Halarnkar, Jennifer Monserrate, Antonio Fernandes, Francisco Silveira, Wilfred D’Sa, Clafasio Dias, Filipe Neri Rodrigues and Atanasio Monserrate— who quit and joined BJP. Congress had sought that the 10 MLAs be restrained from attending assembly proceedings and holding constitutional posts till the speaker decided the case. MGP had also filed a disqualification plea against Manohar Ajgaonkar and Deepak Pauskar, who quit and joined BJP in March 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/todays-verdict-on-disqualification-pleas-unlikely-to-impact-bjp-govt/articleshow/82152415.cms||Murari Shetye

Traders, however, ruled out any impact on prices as 15 other APMCs will remain open in Nashik district. “Traders did not participate in the auction at Lasalgaon mandi on Monday, forcing the authorities to announce closure for a week,” said the APMC officials. “We are exploring the possibilities of starting the auction after three days if traders are ready to participate,” said the officials. The Lasalgaon APMC had suspended auction for six days, from July 7 to 12, last year soon after a trader had tested Covid-19 positive. Lasalgaon onion traders association president Nandkumar Daga said that around four people from Lasalgaon village have succumbed to Covid-19 in the recent past. Hence, the market has been closed as a precautionary measure. “There will be no impact on the supply of onions due to the Lasalgaon APMC closure as 15 other APMCs in the district are operational. Moreover, the produce is available in all onion growing states,” said Manoj Jain, a trader. “In fact, the wholesale onion prices have already declined due to adequate supply. Hotels and restaurants are major cosumers of onions, but many of them are not functioning fully due to the Covid-related restrictions,” added Jain. The Lasalgaon APMC had started onion auction in one session since April 15 and the supply had reduced from 30,000 quintal per day to 15,000 quintal, leading to a marginal rise in the prices. On Saturday, the average wholesale price of summer onions at Lasalgaon was recorded at Rs 1,201 per quintal as against Rs 900 per quintal on Thursday. The kharif variety fetched Rs 860 per quintal as against Rs 750 per quintal during the same period. Meanwhile, the ‘Janata curfew’ called by traders received a good response in Lasalgaon town, with the streets wearing a deserted look on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/lasalgaon-apmc-shut-as-7-traders-test-covid-positive/articleshow/82149326.cms||Tushar Pawar

This needs to be viewed seriously by giving priority to the health of students,” he said. As there has been a lack of clarity on switching to online classes, some schools had decided to continue with physical classes. He added that Class 12 government school students of humanities who don’t have practical examination have already been asked to stay at home. For state board schools, practical examinations are underway which will get over by April 23. CBSE schools have completed practical examinations and are conducting offline revision tests.Some of the schools have told parents that in-person classes will continue as usual as only the exams have been postponed. However, the instruction from the school education department say that students need not come to school after their practical examination. “This does not mean that students should not come to schools,” said V Nallasivam, principal of Sowdambikaa matriculation higher secondary school, Thuraiyur. Padma Srinivasan, principal of Sri Vignesh Vidyalaya Senior Secondary school, Trichy, said that offline revision test is on for the students of Class 12 and they are planning to have offline classes once the tests are over. “Students have been coming on alternate days to attend offline classes in the last two months. We are planning to continue this as we could ensure social distancing and follow all the preventive measures,” she said. Some of the schools have already switched to online classes anticipating increasing Covid-19 cases. “We are planning to switch to online classes as the number of Covid-19 cases are on the rise,” said C J Chacko, principal, Samadh Higher secondary school (CBSE), Trichy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/schools-told-to-switch-to-online-classes-for-class-xii-students/articleshow/82152385.cms||Sampath Kumar

Technical snags reported in transmission lines and transformers are forcing the electricity board to suspend power distribution for hours, leaving the consumers frustrated amid the scorching summer. Residents said that Tangedco’s helplines often remain unavailable.Tangedco sources said that the scheduled maintenance was hindered for the past two months due to the assembly election. Since many of the transformers were serviced and reused, lack of maintenance is casting an effect with snags reported in multiple localities. In Karumandapam, electricity distribution was suspended for a few hours in the early hours of Sunday leaving the residents sleepless. Similarly, the Rockfort and Vayalur road localities reported power outages for a brief time. Snags in the transmission are forcing Tangedco to suspend the electricity distribution to carry out the emergency maintenance work. The transformers that need overhauling are being sent to the state-run maintenance centres for servicing and were reinstated again.  “We have prepared a chart to take up the scheduled maintenance. High temperature in the summer is causing components to develop snags. We will complete the maintenance soon,” a senior Tangedco official told TOI. The electricity load in the city this summer has increased by 10-20%. On average, Trichy city’s daily consumption was placed at 40 MW. “The helplines are not responding even during the emergency,” C Balasubramanian, a resident of Karumandapam, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/poor-maintenance-hits-power-supply-residents-rue-over-outage/articleshow/82152387.cms||Deepak Karthik

Pallavaram and Tambaram municipalities together had blocked entry and exit of only 34 independent houses, which have three or more cases, till Monday morning. Authorities claimed that the micro-containment plan along with aggressive testing and vaccination drives have helped them in controlling the surge to an extent. The two local bodies together have 1,055 people undergoing treatment for Covid-19. This is roughly only 15% of the active cases in Chengalpet district. Last year during the peak, these two localities had one in every third active case. C Mathivannan, Pallavaram municipal commissioner, said, “A group of volunteers have been roped in to help those in micro-containment zones. Since the spread has been contained at house-level, we are able to focus better on the vaccination programme". In the last two months, a total of 80,000 people have been tested and 11,000 have been vaccinated in Pallavaram municipal area, which has a population of roughly 2.4 lakh. However, in Chennai's western suburbs, Avadi Municipal Corporation has turned 23 streets into containment zones as they have 5-10 cases on an average. Besides this, there are 30 micro-containment zones in Avadi. The area with a population of 4.7 lakh has only 489 active cases. P Narayanan, Avadi Corporation Commissioner, said that his team has identified 16 wards as priority zones for their ongoing vaccination drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/no-containment-zones-in-chennais-southern-suburbs/articleshow/82151092.cms||Ram Sundaram

Memories of her mother, who was posted at police headquarters at the time of death, could not dent her confidence as Deepali confronted violators at Old Katol Naka Square, and ensured they undergo RAT. A commerce graduate, Deepali braved the afternoon sun to step up and check bikers and motorists, ask them the reasons for stepping out sternly, but without sounding haughty. Though new to the job, Deepali pointed out some suspected violators to her seniors, who made them undergo the antigen test. In the presence of TOI scribe, two of those tested turned out to be positive. “It’s just two months that I have joined the police department but the nature of my job is not unfamiliar, as we used to see our mother going for duty. If I have doubts, the seniors are present to guide me,” said Deepali. She also said Covid could not lower her morale as she is ‘police’ now, whose duty is to fight the fear. Deepali was part of the newly recruited cops drafted into the security bandobast at Old Katol Naka, where the police and Nagpur Municipal Corporation have set up a RAT camp. Those loitering on roads are questioned about the reason for moving out, to check if they are in contravention of the extended Covid restrictions, in place till May 1 to break the corona chain. Those testing positive are sent to institutional quarantine centre for 14 days. Deepali was deployed, along with many of her colleagues, on the instructions of city police chief Amitesh Kumar, who wanted to increase the police strength at crucial junctions to ensure stricter checking. Like Deepali, her 21-year-old colleague Mahima Thakur too sounded strong though it was her first duty as a police constable after joining the department. Another new recruit, constable Kavita Kalsarpe, who joined in place of her late husband, too said she is not feeling out of place and wants to continue the tough job to support the family. The youngest of them, 18-year-old Harsh Raghorte, too sounded enthusiastic about his maiden assignment along with his colleague 24-year-old Ajay Shrivastav. City police and NMC conducted 207 tests in all on Monday. Six persons were sent to the quarantine centre. Around 158 were pulled up for not wearing masks while another 606 for violating social distancing norms.

Despite the price hike, many people prefer the summer fruit to beat the heat keeping the demand high.A dozen matured pieces of nungu in Trichy are being sold at Rs 60, which was sold for Rs 50 last year. As the local availability of nungu is limited, traders are buying the summer fruit in bulk from southern districts including Tuticorin and Tirunelveli. While the price has surged, the street vendors selling nungu have declined, due to the limited supply. The limited number of vendors selling nungu has been confined to the market localities, and they are absent in the commercial streets this season.“In the previous years, we were getting nungu from Pudukottai district, but the availability has dwindled now. Wholesale traders, citing the transport cost, are selling nungu at higher prices,” T Kala, a street vendor near Gandhi Market, said. Even though the price is high, local people are in no mood to give up the fruit that is exclusively available in the summer. However, the price of nungu in rural Trichy including Thuraiyur is around Rs 30 per dozen.The vendors said that the price of the summer fruit may escalate further in the coming months as the demand will shoot up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/nungu-price-goes-up-amid-high-demand/articleshow/82152390.cms||---

The civic body had recently received the first lot of 2,500 injections from a Bengaluru-based pharma company, that was also exhausted on Sunday night. NMC requires around 450 to 500 remdesivir injections per day at these two civic hospitals, but now there is scarcity. An order for 20,000 remdesivir injections was recently placed. NMC has also made payment to the company concerned. The company last week sent the first lot of the 2,500 remdesivir injections to the civic body for its two civic hospitals. When contacted, Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the medical superintendent of NMC admitted that the civic body is facing a shortage of remdesivir and its stock ended on Sunday night. “We are already in touch with the pharma company for more supply. The company has assured us to supply the remdesivir injections in a day or two,” said Nagargoje. There is already a scarcity of remdesivir injections in the city. A group of around 50 people, who were relatives of Covid patients, had staged an agitation in the Meher signal area of the city around a week ago, seeking availability of injections for their family members. Addressing the reporters after the Covid review meeting on Saturday, district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal had said there has been a scarcity of the remdesivir in the district. While there was a huge demand for the injection, the district was getting only 500 injections per day. Bhujbal said he spoke to the Bengaluru-based pharma company and said an adequate supply of the injections will begin after April 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/remdesivir-shortage-in-2-civic-hosps/articleshow/82149319.cms||Tushar Pawar

Be prepared to give swab sample||Trichy: Trichy corporation and health department have started collecting samples from people spotted on city roads without facemasks. Mobile medical units (MMU) collecting random samples have been allotted four additional vehicles, increasing its strength to eight, to lift samples from vulnerable localities in the city. Since asymptomatic patients can spread the infection to healthy population, the MMUs are collecting swab samples randomly to gauge the spread and as an early intervention tool. Despite the penalisation drive conducted by both the police and corporation, a significant number of two-wheeler riders and pedestrians move about on commercial streets without facemasks. “People caught without facemasks on roads were insisted to get tested. Only if they agree to get tested and cooperate throughout the process, we collect samples from them,” a health worker said. Each of the vehicles shall have four people including a medical officer to sensitize the public, a lab technician to collect samples and a helper. Every MMU collects around 80-90 samples per day covering vulnerable localities. In close-packed localities such as Malligaipuram and Palakkarai, the team randomly lifted samples including from two-wheeler riders without facemasks. The health workers collected Aadhaar and mobile details to alert the test results. Since a few people were registering false contact information, health workers were registering the address mentioned in multiple ID cards. “A majority of the people we screen are from the floating population, the rest are those in ITeS companies and office spaces in K Abishekapuram and Ariyamangalam zones. It is challenging to convince people without any symptoms to get tested,” a health officer in charge of MMU said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/violating-facemask-rule-be-prepared-to-give-swab-sample/articleshow/82152389.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Pune||Bhave’s films on illnesses opened minds to stigma||Pune: Veteran filmmaker Sumitra Bhave, winner of the 64th National Award for best film for ‘Kaasav’, died of prolonged illness in a private hospital in Pune on Monday. She was 77 years old. She has also directed acclaimed films like Devrai, Doghi, Dahavi Fa and Ha Bharat Maza that won national accolades. Bhave is survived by her daughter. She was known for her out-of-the-box content and for the way she handled social issues in her films. She has directed 14 films, over 50 documentaries and written four television series and won many international awards for her work. Veteran filmmaker Mohan Agashe,who has worked with Bhave, and had scripted another project for the elderly people with her said, “No other filmmaker has handled as sensitively and sensibly five highly stigmatized illnesses as she did in her films __ Zindagi Zindabad, Devrai, Nital, Astu and Kaasav dealing with HIV, schizophrenia, leucoderma, dementia and depression.” Agashe said Bhave, a social scientist and researcher, was groomed in Tata Institute of Social Sciences in sociology. “She realised the power of cinema as the most effective medium to communicate authentic scientific information in an entertaining manner to combat stigma and dispel misunderstandings and myths about these illnesses in a simple language stressing the vital role of humanity in medicine. It is a great loss for viewers of her films and also a personal loss for me as a producer of her last two films,” he added. Filmmaker Sunil Sukthankar said Bhave had been undergoing treatment in a city hospital since January when she started having health issues. “She was in hospital since the past few days, but I was Covid-19 positive and recovering. I completed my quarantine and was able to be with her for the last three days,” he added. Sukhtankar, who co-directed quite a few films with Bhave, said, “She had two major projects in hand -- one was a documentary on vocalist Prabha Atre and a film for the elderly which she had jointly scripted with Agashe. After she started having health issues in January, she settled down a bit and started reading, watching films of her liking and began recording her memories from her experiences that she thought should be documented.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bhaves-films-on-illnesses-opened-minds-to-stigma/articleshow/82151168.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Rajkot||Collector’s appeal: Can’t take any more patients now||Rajkot: Jamnagar collector Ravi Shankar on Monday made a desperate appeal to people from other districts not to rush to Jamnagar’s GG Hospital for Covid-19 treatment there were no beds available any more. According to the collector’s office currently, 2,000 patients are under treatment at Saurashtra region’s largest Covid hospital, which has witnessed a heavy rush from cities like Rajkot and Morbi where the government facilities are full. “We request patients from other districts not to come to Jamnagar as all beds are full. We have more than 2,000 patients in the hospital designated for 1,232 patients,” Ravi Shankar said in a statement. Official sources said over 60 ambulances were waiting outside GG Hospital with patients who were seeking admission. Every 3 to 5 minutes, one ambulance from Rajkot and Morbi arrives with a patient at the GG Hospital which is designated to handle coronavirus patients from Jamnagar, Devbhumi Dwarka and Porbandar district only. The district administration is already in the process of creating additional facilities at Ayurved Hospital, dental and mental colleges. However, it will take four more days. The facility will have 400 beds out of which 370 will have oxygen support.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/collectors-appeal-cant-take-any-more-patients-now/articleshow/82151175.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Second Covid wave halts revival plans of businesses||The Covid second wave has halted revival plans of the state’s businesses and disrupted plans to bring back more staff to the office. While recent restrictions on night movement and shortage of labour has hit industrial clusters, the services sector have gone back on plans to open up workspaces to achieve better collaboration. "Tirupur's textile cluster and the foundries of Coimbatore have been badly affected because out-of-state labour has started going back once more. The night restrictions are also affecting movement of labour for larger factories,” CITU president and labour activist A Soundararajan, said. The forging cluster in Chennai is grappling with non-availability of oxygen which is a key requirement for the sector. "We have also been hit with guest workers leaving for their native towns given that 30-40% of workers in this industry are temp workers," Vikas Bajaj, president, Association of India Forging Industry, said. Auto makers are continuing to stick to a hybrid system with white collar staff coming in only limited days. While a Ford spokesperson said shifts are continuing as planned right now, a source at Hyundai India said auto companies are seeking clarity over running third (night) shifts in view of new restrictions. Companies like TVS Motor, Daimler India, and others are vaccinating both employees and families, and have cut down worker presence in factory. "We are encouraging support functions to work from home and create better distancing for manufacturing staff,” a TVS Motor spokesman said. Recent restrictions allow IT companies to operate at 50% capacity but there are no takers in the sector that is still fully remote. IT giant Cognizant had earlier set July 1 as its "earliest return-to-office target date" and says it is monitoring the situation closely and following remote work until then. Sources in global shared service centres in the city say they had earlier planned to gradually open up in June but are now looking at September to reassess the situation. Other tech firms such as GAVS Tech, OrangeScape, Intellect Design, Facilio and others, who had just started bringing teams into office for better morale and well-being, have reverted to complete WFH in recent days. “We had started a remote plus model where employees were coming in on a rotation basis to lift their morale and bring in collaboration but have now announced a WFH policy,” Suresh Sambandam, OrangeScape, said. Vijay Rangaraju, senior VP of HR, Intellect Design said that as cases declined, employees who wished to come to office were allowed to come once a week taking all precautions, but the company has now gone back to complete WFH. GAVS Tech had decided to increase % of staff at office to around 25% from 10% but the company has dropped the plan after the recent surge. Tech startups that had started to open offices to employees who wished to come have now gone back to WFH. GoFrugal, for instance, had earlier in Feb allowed new joiners to work from office to better experience work culture but it has now announced mandatory WFH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/second-covid-wave-halts-revival-plans-of-businesses/articleshow/82151166.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Parents join online crash courses to learn how to teach kids at home||PUNE: The burden of teaching students now lies almost solely on parents with classes going online. Coaching classes, home-based tutors and educators in the city have begun crash courses for parents to clarify their concepts from the syllabus so that they can teach their children. Parents are subscribing to these courses by paying fees ranging from Rs 1,000 per session to Rs 10,000 depending on the syllabus covered and sessions attended. The crash courses are being conducted for parents whose students are studying in standards I to V. Parents said the online mode was not suitable for their children so they decided to learn the concepts and method of teaching so they could coach their children one-on-one Akanksha Pardeshi, an IT professional, who works from home from 10am to 7pm has a nine-year old daughter attending online classes for one year now. She said her daughter has not been able to grasp the lessons through the virtual medium as she would offline. Pardeshi has been trying to teach her daughter some important maths and science concepts. She came across a social media advertisement from her teacher friend who is taking classes just for parents like her who want to teach their children at home but do not know the method or the concepts well. Pardeshi said, “I am a state board student and my daughter is studying in an CICSE board school. Their syllabus and our syllabus when I learnt are different. I was unable to teach her expansion in maths or the concept of photosynthesis, for instance. So I decided to join this class started by my friend to teach parents some important concepts from my daughter’s books. I was happy during my trial class last year so I have taken seven short courses to learn how to teach.” Another parent, Vinay Rao, said the first term last year was very tough for his son as he would be less attentive and missed important online classes. “The schools have been told to promote students but there is no yardstick or measure to see what the child has learnt due to the present mode of learning. I feel that my child should know these important concepts especially in grammar, maths and science,” he said. Rao said his son completely missed the double digit multiplication last academic year and was unable to solve the problems given in the worksheets. “I tried to see the recorded session by the class teacher and tried to teach him, but failed. So I joined some of the parents of my son’s classmates who had been discussing these crash courses to teach the kids. I was successful,” he added. Marketing manager at edu-tech platform called Success Story, said they have done their market survey and this was something that stood out last year where parents wanted to learn the syllabus only to teach their children. “Parents are not happy with their children just being promoted to the next class. They want their kids to know every concept as these are helpful in the long run,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/parents-join-online-crash-courses-to-learn-how-to-teach-kids-at-home/articleshow/82151159.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Dr Nehal Shah, a city-based psychiatrist, said that the Covid protocols for last rites such as taking the body directly to the crematorium or cemetery with minimal contact doesn’t allow some relatives a natural closure.“Unlike other scenarios, the family members don’t get to take the dead home, perform the last rituals before the cremation or burial, and don’t even have the relatives around (due to isolation) to help them come to terms with the death. Thus, for many, it seems unreal,” he said.Narrating a similar instance, Dr Shah said that a retired bank employee recently lost his wife in the pandemic. “But he would carry on with his life like nothing had happened insisting his wife had gone to her brother’s residence and would come back soon,” he said. “Initially, his son felt he would come to terms with the loss, but when he continued with the routine for over a fortnight, they got worried and sought psychiatric intervention,” said Dr Shah.Dr Pradip Vaghasiya, a city-based psychiatrist, said that even in non-fatal Covid cases, the relatives undergo a rollercoaster of emotions ranging from anger, anxiety to stress and despair. “It’s often possible not to get the required beds, medicines, etc. for the patients. The news from hospital also keep many on tenterhooks. We have indeed seen some extreme cases where we prescribe medicines to calm their nerves,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-protocols-for-last-rites-dont-allow-some-relatives-a-closure/articleshow/82152449.cms||---

No beds, no oxygen and no vaccination as well! It’s nothing but total chaos!” Later, while talking to the media, Raut said he had spoken with a few prominent politicians on the situation in their states and they agreed that the overall scene is grim. “The practice of hiding numbers in some states has stopped...now we can only see patients on the streets, pyres burning everywhere and no space in cemeteries. If the situation is not brought under control now, there will be anarchy in the country,” Raut warned. “I sincerely feel that a special session of Parliament should be held where all MPs should express their views and discuss the Covid situation in their states. The Centre should hear the requirements of all states...It is a national crisis.” Hitting back at Raut, state BJP president Chandrakant Patil said the Covid crisis was critical in Maharashtra. “The situation across the country has not deteriorated much. So, it is not proper to call for a Parliament session...but...for a state assembly session and Raut should advise the government to convene one as he is the voice of the MVA.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-raut-demands-parl-session-to-discuss-covid/articleshow/82152466.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

Out of them, 3,301 patients are undergoing treatment in hospitals, while 11,201 are in home quarantine. There are 5,270 beds reserved for Covid patients, both government (1,894 beds) and private hospitals (3,376), in Jaipur and 3,301 of them are already occupied. In the largest dedicated Covid facility, the RUHS Hospital, all the oxygen beds are occupied. Out of the 1,200 beds in RUHS, 1,079 have corona patients. In private hospitals, too, the occupancy of beds has increased significantly. Government figures show that 627 beds in government hospitals and 1,322 beds in private hospitals, reserved for Covid patients, are vacant. On the availability of beds in Jaipur, health minister Raghu Sharma said, “The RUHS Hospital has 1,200 beds and we have also taken 100 beds from the spine centre adjacent to the hospital for virus patients. Jaipuria and ESI hospitals have been declared as dedicated Covid hospitals.” With the rising load on hospitals, the state government is likely to allow private hospitals to tie-up with hotels to admit patients, like the state government had done during the first wave, in case the crisis deepens. The occupancy in some of the big private and corporate hospitals is full now, following which they have stopped taking new admissions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/active-cases-soar-in-city-govt-mayallow-pvt-hosps-to-tie-up-with-hotels/articleshow/82152452.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||No containment zones yet in hotspot Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: Two weeks after the Telangana high court directed the government to create containment zones in areas where Covid-19 cases were high, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) authorities said they have only identified hotspots and are sanitising for now. The civic body had played a key role in maintaining containment zones, disinfecting localities, tracking contacts of Covid-19 patients to get them tested during the first wave, but residents and health experts said it must do the same, if not more now. “We had containment zones during the first wave because there was no awareness about the pandemic. Now, we have the vaccine and people are aware of the precautions they need to take,” said Dr Rambabu, chief entomologist, GHMC. Officials, however, informed that they have a list of Covid-19 hotspots, and they are requesting locals to voluntarily restrict movement in and out of such places and are urging them to follow the safety protocol. “We have identified hotspots and have instructed gated communities to impose restrictions,” said an official, under whose jurisdiction a gated community, in Madinaguda, reported 121 positive Covid-19 cases. Health experts, on the other hand, pointed out that GHMC’s decision to not mark containment zones might further deteriorate the situation. “The civic body must impose some restrictions to contain the spread in the second wave. We need to create containment zones and restrict movement, especially in public places,” said Dr Satya Prakash, consultant pulmonologist. In yet another fresh order on Monday, the Telangana high court expressed its displeasure over the state government’s failure in handling second wave of Covid-19 in the state. The court directed it to publicise information on the micro-containment zones through media bulletins and include data of newly declared containment zones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-slams-govt-over-handling-second-wave-of-covid-19/articleshow/82151200.cms||Moulika.KV

---||Pune||PMC advances monsoon cleaning work by a month||PUNE: The civic body has preponed monsoon cleaning of roadside sewage lines and stormwater drains by a month. The work, which normally starts in the last week of May, will start in the last week of April. A decision has also been taken to hand over the work to the drainage department, instead of the usual choice of the road department. A Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) official said, around Rs4.5 crore will be spent on the work, which is to be carried out at the ward office level and also by the the drainage department office. The work should be completed by June, as per the official. As many as 15 tenders have been issued for the cleaning work. Each ward office will get to spend around Rs30 lakh on this work in their areas. “The ground work will start across civic areas once the tendering process is over and orders are issued. The PMC has completed the tendering process and the allotment of work will be done by next week. Some pre-approved work has already begun,” said Jagdish Khanore, head of PMC’s drainage department. According to PMC data, nearly 30,000 chambers are to be cleaned ahead of monsoon season in addition to sewage lines, spanning nearly 800 kilometres. “Since the drainage department is doing the work for the first time after a gap of many years, coordination will be hectic. The staff is yet to get familiarised with the work. It may be a more time consuming exercise this year, so the department has decided to start early,” said a senior PMC official. As per the senior official, assigning work will be a tight rope walk for the department as it would have to be distributed among the limited available staff. Apart from the roadside sewage lines and chambers, nullahs have to be cleaned as well. PMC officials said nullah cleaning would commence next month, tenders for which are to be issued next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-advances-monsoon-cleaning-work-by-a-month/articleshow/82151206.cms||---

It said it had launched ‘Operation Shakti’ to strengthen healthcare facilities at potest sites and encourage protesters to use precautions. The morcha claim that Operaton Shakti was being launched to counter ‘Operation Clean’, which the governments are reportedly planning to launch to end the protest. SKM leader Yogendra Yadav said, “Under Operation Shakti, we will spread awareness among protesting farmers to wear masks. We will also display posters on precautions and symptoms of Covid in every trolley and tent. Efforts will be made for proper arrangements for vaccination at all protest sites around Delhi.

Drugs Control Administration (DCA) has also granted permission to Hetero Drugs and Mylan Labs to start two more Remdesivir production units to meet demand. A top DCA official told TOI, “Hetero Drugs is producing 34,000 vials and Mylan Labs 37,000 vials of Remdesivir per day in Telangana. Dr Reddy’s production is in Andhra Pradesh. Supplies from other companies reduced drastically. We have granted production permission for Hetero and Mylan in other firms. They will be fully functional in two weeks as currently they are in sterility period.” DCA director Preeti Meena has coordinated with the industry and dispatched an oyxgen tanker to Bellary. Sridhar Reddy of Asara Oxygen Suppliers told TOI, “Based on the request of the state government, Jindal agreed to give 1600 tonnes of oyxgen. We have sent our tanker to them. Today, it is likely to be loaded. Another tanker is also being sent. Though Odisha plant agreed to supply, it will take six days for supply. Efforts are on for supplies from RINL Vizag too.” The oxygen usage has shot up in the past one week. “Currently, the requirement per day is 300 tonne in Hyderabad and surrounding districts. Production is only 100 tonne. Normally, 160 tonne of oxygen is required and it is met from supplies out of the state. There are only two production units in Telangana — Ellanebarrie in Jadcherla and Inox. There is need for more oxygen units in the state,” sources said. State has imposed a ban on industrial use of oxygen. Industry was also facing tanker shortage for getting supplies. “All tankers are deployed in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh,” officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-can-breathe-easy-1600-tons-of-oxygen-supply-on-the-way/articleshow/82151215.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The members, however, rued the lack of conservation efforts and increased human activity leading to the destruction of butterfly habitats.As summer leads to the drying up of streams, soil-beds are buzzing with hundreds of male butterflies. They swoop in the mud puddle to get the required minerals and salts for mating from the mud, sand and silt left on the soil bed.“We were able to document about 70 species of butterflies, some of which are rare and endemic to these forests. The Tamhini forest is relatively free from human activity and hence the butterfly habitats are safe here,” said Rajat Joshi, an MSc environmental science student from Fergusson College.The group of butterfly enthusiasts came together in 2017 and it used to visit hills around Pune and other areas documenting the butterflies. They also used to conduct nature walks for people to spread awareness about butterflies.“Like bees, butterflies are very important in the food chains as they are pollinators. Hence, we need to ensure that the city does not destroy its butterfly habitats. We need more butterfly gardens in the city,” said Pavan Damoor, a finance manager, who is also a butterfly enthusiast.Damoor said due to the lockdown, pollution levels in the city had gone down, leading to many butterflies endemic to the Sinhagad region coming to the city. Rajat says that the conservation will start with documentation and awareness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/enthusiasts-document-around-60-butterfly-varities-in-tamhini-forests/articleshow/82151211.cms||Ardhra Nair

Last March, HC had granted pre-arrest bail to BJP MP J S Mahaswamiji and had stayed a February 2020 order of the Solapur district caste certificate scrutiny panel invalidating his certificate. Aabad Ponda, counsel for Bulla, said his client was not named in the FIR. Additional public prosecutor Prajakta Shinde admitted it was true, but said the probe and statements of several persons recorded point to his role in preparing a ‘Beda Jangam’ certificate. The prosecution also said documents and seals of executive magistrate were found when Bulla’s house was searched. But Justice Sadhana Jadh-av in her order said “the beneficiary has been protected by this court in nature of pre-arrest bail” and added that Bulla’s “further custody is unwarranted”. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-agent-gets-bail-in-fake-caste-cert-case-of-mp/articleshow/82152486.cms||---

Even though administration is trying to augment the supply, they are nowhere near success as yet. The highest daily figure of Covid deaths of 113 on Monday comes one day after Sunday when city received no Remdesivir and Tocilizumab consignment and many hospitals ran out of stock. On Saturday too, city had received only 395 vials of Remdesivir that were allotted to government and a couple of other hospitals further aggravating shortage on Sunday. After last week’s acute shortage of Remdesivir, city covid hospitals received 60% of their allotted numbers of beds on Monday. The hospitals had last got 100% of their Remdesivir demand and Tocilizumab on April 12. As the acute shortage of Remdesivir and Tocilizumab, along with oxygen cylinders, started hitting the Covid patients hard, deaths seemed to have surged. On April 15, there were 74 deaths and figure went on increasing progressively until Monday when for the first time it crossed the century mark in the district. On April 16, with shortage of continuing, deaths were 75, which went up to 79 the following day and to 85 on Sunday. Though the link between dearth of drugs and increased fatality rate has not been clinically established, doctors feel the two factors are related and use of the two drugs has salvaged the condition in many critical cases. Dr Anup Marar, convener of the Vidarbha Hospitals Association, said there is an uncanny association with the shortage of Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and oxygen with fatality rate rising unlike in the past. “With Tocilizumab, several patients were brought back from the verge of death and even Remdesivir had helped stabilize many aggravated cases,” he said. “Availability of these crucial injections could have surely pulled back many patients,” said Dr Marar. Dr Manoj Purohit of Radiance hospital termed Tocilizumab as ‘Brahmastra’ in Covid battle. “Around 50% deaths could have possibly been avoided if Tocilizumab had been available.We were also bereft of enough Remdesivir and oxygen at the same time which proved fatal as patients slipped out of our hands,” he said. Dr Pinak Dande of Dande hospital too said death rate had certainly increased when Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and oxygen were in short supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/is-remdesivir-toci-shortage-pushing-up-districts-death-rate/articleshow/82151437.cms||Soumitra Bose

Check the timings once again before leaving your house as the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahmedabad is set to undertake runway maintenance of the airport from Tuesday. Several flights have been rescheduled at the city airport as the runway will be closed from 11am to 5pm between April 20 and April 30 (except April 24). This is the first major maintenance project undertaken at the airport after its operations, maintenance, and development was taken over by Adani Ahmedabad International Airport Limited (AAIAL) under a public-private partnership. Measures have been undertaken to ensure that passengers face no problem during this period. “We have also deployed adequate resources to handle peak-hour traffic and smooth passenger movement. However, passenger movement at the city airport has reduced significantly owing to Covid restrictions,” said a spokesperson of Adani Airports. Sources said passenger movement has reduced to an estimated 7,000 in a day at the city airport unlike 35,000 per day in pre-Covid period. “Adequate arrangement like additional manpower and, as per the standard operating procedures, airlines’ schedules affected by the runway closure have been revised in line with the NOTAM (Notice toAirmen) issued. Airline operators proactively communicate these changes to passengers well in advance,” according to the spokesperson. Passengers are as such required to report to the airport two hours prior to flight departure as part of the Covid-19 protocol and the same remains unchanged. The city airport authorities had moved the director general of civil aviation (DGCA) last month to seek nod for undertaking maintenance. According to Adani Airports spokesperson, runway maintenance closures are mandatory procedures in line with international safety standards. This will ensure the safety of operations during monsoon starting from June. The airlines have been informed about closure timings, which will be from 11am to 5pm from Tuesday. The international flight operations are not expected to be affected much, because most of the international flights are scheduled during night and the operations have also been curtailed due to the pandemic situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-flights-between-11am-and-5pm-at-svpia-from-today/articleshow/82152490.cms||---

A couple from Singanallur was also working as paid attenders at the hospital.Sources said that the paid attenders were roaming freely at the Covid ward with full knowledge of doctors and nurses there.After the video went viral on Monday, ESI hospital authorities lodged a complaint with the Singanallur police who rushed to the hospital and held an inquiry with the paid attenders.Preliminary inquiries revealed that 17 people including women were working as paid attenders of Covid-19 positive patients in the hospital. All the paid attenders were chased away from the hospital by police and one of them, Balaji, was detained for interrogation. He was taken to the Singanallur police station.ESI Hospital authorities said that the hospital management permitted the relatives of the patients as attenders. But a gang misused the permission and collected money from patients or their family members. In May 2020, a group of paid attenders were chased away from the ESI hospital by the management.Staff nurses and hospital employees were informed not to allow paid attenders to the Covid-19 wards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/17-paid-attenders-chased-away-from-covid-ward-of-esi-hosp/articleshow/82151331.cms||A Subburaj
---||Coimbatore||Agro foods firm dupes farmers of Rs 42 lakh||Coimbatore: Around 10 farmers from various parts of the state petitioned city police commissioner S Davidson Devasirvatham on Monday, seeking action against an Annur-based agro foods firm for scamming and cheating them of lakhs of rupees.They said Jaya Bharathi Agro Foods was yet to pay them for the agricultural produce that it had bought from them last year. According to the farmers, the firm owes them a combined Rs 42 lakh.The farmers from Neyveli, Salem, Theni and Dharmapuri districts said the firm had approached them through Nithra Tamil Vivasayam App.Govindasamy, 33, a pearl millet farmer from Neyveli, said the app was a common platform for the farmers to post about availability of their produce. “Say, if a farmer posts about the availability of two or five tonnes of millet or vegetables, the firm used to call and tell the person to procure more and give it 10 tonnes to 20 tonnes, by promising cash and transportation cost.” Govindasamy said he had supplied 20 tonnes of pearl millet to the firm.However, when the farmers brought their produce to the firm at Annur, they were paid only 5% advance. The firm used to send away trucks after unloading the goods and the farmers were made to pay for the transportation.“They then used to make us wait still next day, saying the owner was stuck somewhere else on business and would be back. Since we had sent the truck away, we didn’t have an option to take back the goods,” said 30-year-old Damodaran, another millet farmer from Theni. “The firm now owes me Rs 4.2 lakh for the millet I supplied on September 19 last year. I had also complained to the Annur police about it.”According to the farmers, the firm used to have 15 telemarketers when they unload their produce and sport almost an empty office with just a receptionist when they visit the firm again for payment. “We just want our money, because we procured the excess stock from other farmers, mainly relatives and neighbours, who are now demanding their money. We need to pay them,” Govindasamy said.The farmers said 15 of them had signed the complaint.Jayabharathi Agro Foods could not be reached for a comment. Its website was taken down and phones were switched off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/agro-foods-firm-dupes-farmers-of-rs-42-lakh/articleshow/82151351.cms||---

The officer also instructed petitioners who were ill-treated by corrupt cops to meet him.The top cop took the decision after he received three petitions on Monday. “The petitioners had lodged complaints in city police stations about financial frauds. However, some police inspectors and sub-inspectors registered cases against them to save the accused,” a source in the department said. “The commissioner has invited the complainants, who were denied justice, to meet him.”The three cases will be reinvestigated, Devasirvatham told TOI. “Some of our officers failed to discharge their duty.

While they felt the step, taken in the wake of the raging second wave, will go a long way in combating the virus, they were also concerned about its supply and hoped the burgeoning demand would not derail the current vaccination drive for the 45-plus age group. In the past three weeks, several states, including Bengal, have complained of vaccine shortage. The medical fraternity in Kolkata has for long been demanding that the vaccine’s rollout be expanded to include all above 18 years. “No age is immune to the second wave. The surge this time has an onslaught on the younger people. While this decision is a welcome move, we hope the supply will be regular so that we can vaccinate at a faster pace,” said SSKM hepatology department head Abhijit Chowdhury, who is also a public health activist. Health experts said that people above 18 years needed to move out regularly. The first wave had the elder age group vulnerable to the virus, but the age of the infected has gone down this gone. In fact, a 19-year-old is battling the infection on ECMO support at Medical Superspecialty Hospital at present. “Vaccinating people above 18 years is a solid move. But given the current shortage of vaccine supply, we hope the government will approve more vaccines for emergency use authorisation so that the inoculation pace does not get disturbed,” said Subhrojyoti Bhowmick, clinical director (research & academics) at Peerless Hospitals. Bhowmick, who was the principal investigator of the third phase clinical trial of Sputnik V at Peerless, is hopeful of the government rolling out the vaccine along with other vaccines. “This is certainly an welcome step. In the second wave, the infection spreading at an unprecedented pace. Nonetheless, opening up parallel channels of procurement and stockpiling has its challenges. We hope things will be professionally managed,” said senior clinical trial specialist Santanu Tripathi. Meanwhile, erratic supply continued to plague the inoculation programme on Tuesday. Many centres said they had to scale down the drive owing to lesser supply of vials. “Also, there is a backlog of people whose second dose is due. Now, the supply line is a bit better but we continue to get lesser number of vials,” said a vaccination supervisor at a state-run facility. AMRI Salt Lake, which had stopped vaccination on April 10 due to unavailability of vaccine resumed the drive on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/18-jab-a-good-move-but-what-about-supply-docs/articleshow/82150319.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Filmmaker Sumitra Bhave passes away||Pune: Veteran filmmaker Sumitra Bhave, 77, winner of the 64th National Award for best film for Kaasav, died of prolonged illness at a private hospital in Pune on Monday. She has also directed acclaimed films like Devrai, Doghi, Dahavi Fa and Ha Bharat Maza that won national accolades. Bhave is survived by her daughter. She was known for her out-of-the-box content and for the way she handled social issues in her films. She has directed 14 films, over 50 documentaries and written four television series. Bhave has bagged many international awards for her work. Veteran filmmaker Mohan Agashe, who has worked with Bhave, said, “No other filmmaker has handled as sensitively and sensibly five highly stigmatized illnesses as she did in her films —Zindagi Zindabad, Devrai, Nital, Astu and Kaasav dealing with HIV, schizophrenia, leucoderma, dementia and depression.” Agashe said Bhave, a social scientist and researcher, studied sociology at Tata Institute of Social Sciences. “She realised the power of cinema as the most effective medium to communicate authentic scientific information in an entertaining manner to combat stigma and dispel misunderstandings and myths about these illnesses in a simple language, while stressing the vital role of humanity in medicine. It is a great loss for viewers of her films and a personal loss for me as producer of her last two films,” he added. Filmmaker Sunil Sukthankar said Bhave had been undergoing treatment in a city hospital since January when she started having health issues. “She was in hospital since the past few days, but I was Covid-positive and recovering. I completed my quarantine and was able to be with her for the last three days,” he added. Sukthankar, who co-directed quite a few films with Bhave, said, “She had two major projects in hand —one was a documentary on vocalist Prabha Atre and a film for the elderly, which she had jointly scripted with Agashe. After she started having health issues in January, she settled down a bit and started reading, watching films and began recording her memories that she thought should be documented.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-filmmaker-sumitra-bhave-passes-away/articleshow/82152498.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The number of deaths in the 51-60 age-group has been 316, whereas 364 were in the 61-70 age-group and 249 between 71 and 80 years old. Ninety of those who died were between 81 and 90 years old, and four victims were in the 91-100 age-group. To keep the fatality rate in this age segment under check, the NMMC has made it compulsory that all such patients be brought to Covid care centres and dedicated Covid health centres immediately. Times ViewThe NMMC order runs counter to what has been advised nationally – that patients should home quarantine unless they need hospitalization. However, if the civic body feels that it has enough beds in its centres and people aren’t observing home isolation rules and are suffering as a result, it is also up to citizens to follow rules and also not spread the virus.Speaking to TOI, NMMC commissioner Abhijit Bangar said, “As per recent data, around 10% to 11% of all Covid cases detected are of those aged above 50 years. But 80% of the fatalities have been from those above 50. This has become a cause of concern, and we have ordered all node-wise medical officers to refer such patients to our centres for isolation and treatment.” According to NMMC sources, patients in the above-50 age-group in slum areas are following the advice of the authorities to get admitted in Covid centres. But it is people from nodal pockets who prefer to stay home and when their health situation turns critical, they make a hue and cry in search for ICU beds at a time when there is an ICU bed crunch in the city, officials said. “Ward officers have been told to forcibly bring patients above 50 to Covid centres,” said Bangar. NMMC has 11,000 active cases, of which over 1,100 are above 50. As non-oxygen and oxygen beds are available in adequate numbers in NMMC, people have been advised not to isolate themselves at home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-80-of-those-dead-above-50-says-nmmc-chief/articleshow/82152500.cms||B B Nayak
---||Surat||Surat’s New Civil Hospital to produce its own oxygen||Surat: The New Civil Hospital (NCH) in Surat will now be producing its own oxygen which is likely to reduce its dependence on outside resources. As the Diamond City grapples with a shortage of infrastructure and resources to deal with Covid-19 crisis, the 2 kilo-litre pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plant at NCH will help ease pressure on the government hospital. This plant is probably the first in the state, out of the sanctioned four, to begin functioning.After testing, the plant has been functional since the last two days and the oxygen supply is being used for the patients. Total 162 plants were recently sanctioned by the government of India to be installed at government hospitals across the country. The PSA technology separates oxygen from the air and can be used for medical purposes. “The technology is widely in use but for the first time, such a plant has been installed here. The oxygen produced will help NCH meet the current demand and also help in future,” said Yogesh Chaudhary, in-charge of NCH. Chaudhary, an IAS officer, was recently posted as managing director, Dakshin Gujarat Vij Company Limited (DGVCL). Currently, NCH has three oxygen storage plants, once each at Covid-19 hospital, New Kidney hospital which has also been converted into a Covid-19 hospital, and the old NCH building. On average NCH’s required around 60 tonnes of oxygen. While the Surat civic body run SMIMER hospital has one oxygen storage plant and another is under development. SMIMER’s daily average consumption is around 26 tonnes. “There is no shortage of oxygen at present and we are smoothly meeting the demand. In case of increased demand in future, there will not be a shortage,” said Prashant More, the owner of A D More & Sons, who manages the oxygen supply to the government hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surats-new-civil-hospital-to-produce-its-own-oxygen/articleshow/82151392.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

Hospitals are also expected to stop all planned surgeries from Wednesday onwards for at least two weeks. The government also wants private hospitals to hike up Covid beds by 25% to 30% at the earliest possible. State chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay on Monday told private hospitals to leave no stones unturned to enhance the number of Covid beds using innovative ways, be it annexe centres, satellite centres, telemedicine centres or safe homes. He assured administration support from the government. All major private health facilities attended the meeting online. The government officials proposed shifting of OPDs to nearby marriage/banquet halls and utilise hospital lounges so that they could hike up the Covid beds. Most hospitals agreed principally on this but asked the government for a few days to explore and arrange infrastructure. “We are ready to add 51 more beds over the next 15 days, 47 of which with be critical care beds. We will be then be equipped with 161 beds, including 95 critical care ones. We would be focusing on ramping up the satellite facility beds in and around the hospital campus exponentially as an alternative to expand bed capacity,” said R Venkatesh, zonal director (east) of Narayana Health. The government has also asked hospitals to scout for unutilized spaces, buildings and smaller nursing homes and hotels where they can set up Covid beds. The government also proposed the feasibility of shifting dialysis facilities of hospitals to nearby hotels or satellite centres. For manpower resources, the government said it could explore making all medical personnel serve in Covid wards if the situation arises. “The thrust has to be more on critical care beds. We explore all possibilities to enhance our infrastructure,” said Rupak Barua, group CEO of AMRI Hospitals. According to AMRI sources, they can set up a new unit of 100 beds in a brand new building on its Mukundapur campus as soon as they get the permission. “We will be issuing three advisories by tonight itself — on hiking up beds by 25% to 30%, to stop planned surgeries from Wednesday onwards for at least two weeks and for hospitals to ensure that there is no complaint on billing,” said Justice (retired) Ashim Kumar Banerjee, chairman of the West Bengal Clinical establishment Regulatory Commission after the meeting. Others who were present at the meeting included municipal commissioner Vinod Kumar, health secretaries NS Nigam and Sanjay Bansal. Hospitals, however, felt putting planned surgeries on hold was going to be a difficult proposition for patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/shift-opds-to-banquet-halls-put-off-planned-surgeries-govt-to-hosps/articleshow/82150326.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The animal husbandry department is ready to start the annual vaccination programme, but is awaiting vaccine stocks.Radhakrishnan of Veerapandi, who owns 22 cows, said the animals have not been vaccinated in the last two years. “The animals are usually vaccinated during February and March. Though the department launched the drive last year, it was stopped mid-way and my farm missed out on the vaccine. This year also, there is no information if the vaccination drive will take place,” he told TOI.Devaraj of Madhampalayam, owner of 60 cows, said all the animals were vaccinated last year. “This year, I bought the medicine and administered it with the help of my veterinarian as I saw no signs of the vaccination programme starting. With such a large farm, I couldn’t take the risk.”The disease also affects pigs, sheep and goats. “Infected animals develop sores on their tongue and legs, stop taking food and water and become dehydrated,” said Radhakrishnan, who had a couple of his cows infected four years ago.The government has not given the drug and green signal to start vaccination programme this year, said animal husbandry department officials. “We had submitted an action plan, but think the Covid-19 situation is delaying it,” said a director of animal husbandry department. “We have 98 dispensaries to vaccinate 2.36 lakh cattle in the district. We can finish the programme in one month — 21 days intense vaccination and nine days to mop up remaining farms and animals,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/deadlock-over-foot-and-mouth-disease-vaccination-puts-dairy-farmers-in-a-fix/articleshow/82151409.cms||---

Kandavel said that orders have started dwindling more than two weeks ago as Covid cases rose exponentially in northern states and fresh curbs were imposed on the industrial units there.With night curfews on industries, there were very few orders now, he said. “There is a fear that there could be more curbs on industries and hence textile units are not willing to buy the fabric,’’ said M Somasundram, another powerloom unit owner. Due to the drop in demand, looms have cut short production by 50% this week, leaving workers in a state of uncertainty about prospects.Powerloom owners say that textile units are not even ready to buy the stock that is ready. They said that a fortnight back, one metre of the fabric was being sold at Rs 27, which fell to Rs 26 and now to Rs 25. Loom owners point out that the production cost was more than the selling price, but they are selling off at a lower price to exhaust the stock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/stock-worth-crores-stuck-in-powerloom-units/articleshow/82151443.cms||---

Deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said the decisions were announced by Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh during a high-level Covid review meeting. The CM said he had received a request from UT adviser Manoj Parida for a Tricity lockdown on Wednesday. However, Chandigarh will take a call on the restriction on Tuesday. The UT administration has not received any communication from Haryana till date, Parida said, while clarifying that Chandigarh has no plans for a longer-period lockdown. In Mohali, all bars, cinema halls, gyms, spas, coaching centres and sports complexes will be closed from Tuesday till April 30. “The police department has been told to strictly enforce the restrictions and take support of civil society organisations. All weekly markets have also been ordered to shut down,” he said. Gatherings of more than 20 persons, including for weddings/cremations, were banned across the state. Prior approval of the administration was needed for all gatherings of more than 10 persons, except for cremation, the DC said. In Chandigarh, deputy commissioner Mandip Singh Brar held a meeting with resident welfare associations to seek their inputs and cooperation to prevent the spread of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/wednesday-sunday-lockdown-in-mohali/articleshow/82150325.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Scramble for Remdesivir at Hetero spl counter||Hyderabad: Chaotic scenes unfolded outside the Hetero Healthcare counter at Moosapet on Monday as hundreds of people from across the state gathered in hope of procuring Remdesivir vials. The city-based firm had set up the special counter to make the drug available at a price of Rs 20,400 for six vials. The MRP of the injection is Rs 3,490 per 100mg/vial, which translates into Rs 20,940 for six vials. People have been running from pillar to post to procure the drug – often at five times the cost from alleged black marketers. According to those waiting in the queue outside the counter on Monday, the crowd got agitated -- leading to unrest for a brief while -- as they had to wait for hours for their turn. Many travelled long distances to reach the venue as early at 6 am. “Yet, some people who came after us were allowed to go in while we are still waiting outside...this is unfair,” a man is seen saying in a video that went viral on social media. People also accused authorities of poor management. But while the long wait eventually turned out to be fruitful for some people, many returned empty-handed. "After waiting for four hours, I was told the stocks are over. I had to go back with just a token. They asked me to come the next time they set up the shop,” said Sai Teja, who was at the counter to help a friend’s father. He had visited the counter on Saturday too. “While I was there, I saw at least 140 to 170 people standing in line. There was no social distancing. I pray that does not become a Covid-19 hotspot now,” he said. A Hetero spokesperson said the firm has ramped up production of Remdesivir to resolve the shortage and expects the supply to be normalised in Telangana by the middle of this week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/scramble-for-remdesivir-at-hetero-spl-counter/articleshow/82151414.cms||---

With this, the toll has increased to 708. The victim was a 60-year-old hypertensive woman, who died on Saturday, three days after admission to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH).The positivity rate on the day stood at an all-time high of 17.4%. This means almost one in every five people, who were tested, was positive. It is three times more than the national advised average of 5%. Since it was Sunday, officials had run 4,157 RT-PCR tests, of which 735 people tested positive. During the first wave, when the district reached its peak at more than 600 cases a day in September, the highest positivity rate was around 14%.Officials, however, said the positivity rate was only 8%. Dr G Ramesh Kumar, deputy director of public health, said, “In the list, many people who were tested positive two to three days ago were also included. On Saturday, we had taken 9,000 samples. So, as per our calculations, the positivity rate is “normal” for a district that is witnessing a spike. Coimbatore, unlike other districts, is seeing a gradual and slow increase in cases.”The number of people vaccinated on Monday, meanwhile, fell to an all-time low of 2,292, raising doubts about shortage of vaccines. The district administration said there were 6,850 doses in stock - 2,850 in the district storage unit, 1,500 doses in private hospitals, 1,900 in primary health centres and other government hospitals and 300 doses each in the CMCH and the ESI Hospital.“Our three-day average shows a need for 25,000 vaccine doses, but we get only 10,000 vaccines every time we send our van,” said an official, requesting anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/highest-single-day-spike-of-735-covid-cases-recorded/articleshow/82151396.cms||---

A meeting with the Union health secretary and health officials of states, including Bengal, on Tuesday may help the state the modalities of procuring vaccines. On February 24, Bengal had written to the Centre to allow it buy vaccines from Centre-designated depots to roll out a mass vaccination drive in the state. “The CM has already made the stand clear in her February letter (to the Centre). We have been informed of the Centre’s decision today (to allow states to buy vaccines). We are wait-ing for further information on the specifics. There is nothing to say at this juncture,” an official said. Bengal needs 5.4 crore doses to inoculate an estimated 2.7 crore population, which falls in the priority 45+ age group that is now being allowed vaccination. Till now, the state has vaccinated over 87 lakh people in this age group but dwindling supplies has been impacting the inoculation drive, sources said.

This is the primary obligation of the state,” the tribunal observed. The NGT directed the state’s chief secretary to coordinate with other departments concerned, ascertain causes of contamination and take remedial action in the interest of public health. A meeting with departments concerned for the purpose may be held within a month and action taken as decided, says the NGT order. The NGT bench comprising Justice A K Goel, chairperson; Justice Sudhir Agarwal, judicial member; and Nagin Nanda, expert member, has passed these orders while disposing of an application filed by advocate H C Arora. Grievance in the application was against failure to take remedial action against pollution of water and providing potable water in areas of Punjab where the available water is polluted. The applicant had, on the basis of information obtained through RTI, said water available in the government schools of Punjab was drawn from submersible pumps and was unfit for drinking. On test, the water is found exceeding the laid down parameters of alkalinity, hardness, calcium and total dissolved solids (TDS). The bench observed, as per RTI information, that the water of 63 government schools of Ludhiana district was found exceeding parameters of alkalinity, hardness, calcium and TDS. The NGT observed water supplied through submersible pumps of 23 other government schools was found to have bacterial contamination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/impure-water-in-schools-ngt-for-action-in-punjab/articleshow/82151506.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Helpline horror & botched referral rule trigger deaths||LUCKNOW: A 63-year-old woman suffering from Covid-19 died at the gates of a private hospital on Rae Bareli road during the wee hours of Monday due to an alleged goof up by district health authorities. She was allotted a bed in the hospital 13 hours after registration at the Integrated Covid Command Control Centre (ICCC). When the family reached the hospital with the patient, the staff informed them that no bed was available. By the time the family could find an alternative, the patient died. This is just one example of many Covid-19 patients in the city dying because of delay in response from the ICCC, tardy issuance of referral by the office of the chief medical officer (CMO) and goof-ups in verification of bed availability before referring patients to a hospital. “My mother was in home isolation for a week after testing positive but her condition deteriorated on Sunday morning. Her blood oxygen level dropped to 55%. After trying for two hours, we got assurance of help from ICCC around 10am. Two hours later, ICCC called to inform that an ambulance will soon shift her to a hospital but it arrived after nine hours,” said the daughter of the deceased, a resident of Transportnagar. “On reaching the hospital, the staff told us that they have no vacancy. We called ICCC and helplines again for an alternative, but her oxygen levels dropped to 41 at 1am and she died within seconds,” she added. Under treatment at RSM Hospital (L1 category for moderate cases) after testing positive a week ago, Balaganj resident Rajkumar Rastogi’s condition deteriorated on Monday and blood oxygen level dropped to 81%. “Doctors told me around 11am that if not provided ICU support, my father’s lungs might stop working. However, there was no ICU in the hospital and he had to be shifted to L3 hospital,” Rajkumar’s son Swapnil said. “I approached senior officials through multiple channels for shifting of my father to L3 facility but nothing happened till late night. I was told by an officer in ICCC that a referral has been sent to the CMO for approval. I called CMO several times but he did not respond,” he added. Neeru Srivastava (52) died of Covid-19 at a private hospital in Gomtinagar on Sunday. “When the hospital refused to seal the body, we approached the CMO office but lines were busy. The hospital staff left the body in the open. The CMO office responded after two hours and sent a hearse,” said Ishan Srivastava, the nephew of the deceased. Repeated attempts to contact CMO Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar went in vain as he did not take any call. Other officers said they were trying their best to manage the unprecedented crisis caused by the pandemic. Health official’s frantic calls go unanswered too: A senior health officer attached to the CMO office, who himself is in home isolation after testing Covid-19 positive, also complained that he made frantic calls to several of his colleagues at the CMO office and ICCC to get a few serious Covid patients admitted to hospitals, but nobody picked the phone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/helpline-horror-botched-referral-rule-trigger-deaths/articleshow/82152519.cms||Yusra Husain

Sources in the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) health department said normal functioning of the crematorium was disrupted for over three hours after the body was brought in at 10.30am. According to a civic official, the body was brought to Keoratala from a Bhowanipore neighbourhood after a local physician issued a death certificate for the woman who succumbed to Covid at home. According to the death certificate, which was submitted at Keoratala, the woman had also been suffering from pneumonia. The real trouble started as soon as the KMC doctors came to realize the mistake and conveyed the message to the doms who were preparing to cremate the body. A section of the doms immediately reacted and refused to cremate it. KMC officials then requested the deceased’s daughter to take the body to a Covid-designate crematorium. However, all requests and appeals on behalf of the crematoria staff fell on deaf ears as the daughter insisted that her mother be cremated at Keoratala. At this point, a section of crematorium officials contacted Trinamool MP Mala Roy, who lives nearby. After Roy took up the matter with the KMC brass and local police station, a team of officers visited the spot. But the victim’s daughter refused to relent and even threatened to stage a dharna there if her mother was not cremated at Keoratala. Finally, after much persuasion, she agreed to shift her mother’s body. A team of KMC paramedics and ambulance drivers came to the spot and they headed for Dhapa crematorium. At this point, the daughter objected to KMC’s plan to cremate the body at Dhapa. The Trinamool MP intervened again and the ambulance driver was instructed to take the body to Nimtolla crematorium. The cremation was complete by afternoon, a KMC official confirmed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covid-body-at-non-cov-crematorium-sparks-row/articleshow/82150335.cms||Saikat Ray

Sadly, the ASI was unaware that his wife had succumbed to the infection at the same hospital three days prior to his death. The 57-year-old ASI of Alwal had joined police department in 1985. His last posting was at the Bowenpally police station. On April 7, the ASI tested positive and on April 8, he was admitted to a private hospital on Minister’s Road. According to Bowenpally inspector K Ravi Kumar, the ASI was suffering from heart ailments and he underwent heart surgeries twice in the past. “While undergoing treatment at the hospital, the ASI succumbed at 9.30pm on Sunday,” the inspector said. The ASI’s 55-year-old wife, who had also tested positive on April 7, was also admitted to the same hospital after the ASI had been admitted. “While undergoing treatment, she succumbed on April 15. As the ASI was critical, his family members did not inform him about his wife’s death,” the inspector said. The couple’s two children are married. A 53-year-old head constable of Dabeerpura police station, who also tested positive on April 16, succumbed while undergoing treatment at a hospital at Gachibowli. “He was suffering from heart and kidney-related ailments. On Sunday night, he was shifted to hospital. He succumbed on Monday,” Dabeerpura inspector N Satyanarayana said. The head constable, who was from Bahadurpura, is survived by his wife.

Traders at the Mohana Mandi on Monday stated that there has been a rise of 40 per cent in the vegetable prices since weekend curfew was announced. Even though the state government has clearly mentioned that supply of vegetables should not be hampered, vehicles carrying vegetables from nearby districts including Tonk, Sikar and Dausa are getting affected. “There has been a limited supply of potatoes, onions, coriander, bottle gourd and other vegetables since Thursday. Due to this, prices have shot up. If the supply is proper prices will dip,” said Abdul Sagir a wholesale trader of vegetables at the Mohana Mandi. The increased demand for fruits amidst curfew and Ramzan has already been a cause of concern for the homemakers. “Due to increased Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra supply of onions from Nashik has also been affected badly,” said Sitaram Saini, a wholesale trader of onions and garlic at Sodala vegetable market. Wholesale traders said that the recently announced restrictions have cleared that vegetable supplies should not be hampered but farmers from the nearby districts are apprehensive and not moving into Jaipur. “Farmers are selling their crop of vegetables in their respective villages rather than coming here. We are in constant touch and are also facilitating them for their smooth entry into the city,” said a wholesaler at Mohana Mandi. Also, on Monday different vegetable markets saw panic buying as people were trying to get supply of vegetables for a week. “The increased demand amidst curtailed supply has also increased the prices of the vegetables. Hopefully after Wednesday things will be better and prices may dip,” said Banwari Lal, a wholesaler at the Mohana Mandi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/limited-supply-from-dists-sees-veggie-prices-go-up-by-40/articleshow/82151501.cms||Ashish Mehta

---||Kolkata||Markets a mix of good & bad after govt directive||Kolkata: There was a stark difference between two sections of the city’s major markets on Monday a day after the state issued an advisory asking Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) and the police to keep vigil on them as part of a crowd-management strategy in the wake of a rising Covid graph. While New Market was almost the usual in terms of people gathering in large numbers near the hawkers, the scene at Gariahat market was different, with fewer hawkers. According to Bappa Das, a hawker of ready-made garments at Gariahat, the second Covid wave had infected some hawkers and made others scared. “Some of us had to take risk during the Chaitra sale just to earn money. Now, when the virus is fast spreading and the government is keen on taking preventive measures, we need to respond. But we will have to take a middle path. We can’t accept another lockdown now,” Das said. Hawkers at New Market conceded they would now have to do business following Covid protocol, but said they won’t compromise with their daily earnings. “I know I need to protect myself, my family and fellow hawkers by following some Covid rules. But a section of us doesn’t buy this rationale and behave irresponsibly. We need to make them aware. But the fact remains that we can’t sit idle,” said Mohammed Imtiaz, who sells leather goods at New Market. Meanwhile, the SS Hogg Market Traders Association has decided to appeal to all shoppers to strictly abide by Covid rules. Association president Ashok Gupta said that besides advising traders and their employees to wear masks, shoppers were being asked to wear masks and sanitize their hands every time they visited a stall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/markets-a-mix-of-good-bad-after-govt-directive/articleshow/82150403.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||Civic safe homes to create 2,000 more beds in Kolkata||KOLKATA: With almost all hospitals — both government and private — running packed to capacity, Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) is trying to open safe homes that would create 2,000 beds for asymptomatic patients or those with mild symptoms who don’t require immediate hospitalization. The decision was taken after a meeting at Uttirna in Alipore, where state urban development minister Firhad Hakim interacted with physicians and bureaucrats associated with the state Covid-combat squad. After Hakim took stock of the KMC infrastructure, it was decided that the civic body would reopen a large safe home at Anandapur that will accommodate 700 patients. KMC will make best use of state government building Uttirna and create a safe home with 500 beds, a source said. KMC will also utilize Gitanjali stadium and reopen a safe home for 200 patients. The civic body has already converted Kishore Bharati stadium into a safe home that can accommodate 100 patients. “We have planned to augment its capacity to 500,” said a KMC health department said. Apart from Kishore Bharati stadium, KMC has started a safe home at Topsia with an initial capacity of 80. The safe homes at Anandapur, Kishore Bharati and Gitanjali will be utilized for patients who may turn up from areas off EM Bypass or its adjacent south Kolkata neighbourhoods. Last year, KMC had converted Gitanjali stadium into a safe home during the peak of the pandemic. The stadium had the capacity to accommodate over 400 asymptomatic patients. At the Anandapur safe home, KMC had arranged for 300 beds. The safe homes at the stadium were dismantled in October last year after the Covid situation improved. Besides reopening several safe homes, the civic body is also set to reopen a quarantine centre at Rajarhat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/civic-safe-homes-to-create-2000-more-beds/articleshow/82150368.cms||Saikat Ray

The Defence Bio-Engineering and Electro Medical Laboratory (DEBEL), Bengaluru, of DRDO has developed SpO2 (Blood Oxygen Saturation) supplemental Oxygen Delivery System for soldiers at extreme high altitudes. This automatic system delivers supplemental oxygen based on the SpO2 levels and prevents the person from sinking in to hypoxia, which can be fatal. Hypoxia is a state in which the amount of oxygen reaching the tissues is inadequate to fulfil all the energy requirements of the body. Similar symptoms are seen in Covid patients, DRDO said in a statement on Monday. “Being ever in the forefront to support the Indian soldier in most difficult terrain and adverse circumstances, the DRDO has developed yet another system, which is of a great value not only to the Indian Army soldiers fighting in the extreme high altitudes areas but also would be a boon to the country in this extreme crisis of Covid-19 pandemic,” DRDO said. “Since the system is indigenously developed for operation in field conditions, it is unique with its dual qualities of being robust and cheap and is already in bulk production with industry,” DRDO said. DRDO said the system was a boon in the current pandemic as the same can be used in the household for moderate Covid patients for Oxygen flow therapy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/drdo-device-comes-in-handy-for-covid-hit/articleshow/82151504.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

Anshuman Singh (30), had to undergo a gallbladder surgery at a private hospital in the second week of April but it was cancelled after the surge in Covid-19 cases. He tried to go to KGMU but patient intake was limited there. “I have acute pain and don’t know what will happen if my gallbladder bursts,” he said. Asif Siddiqui (62), who has been advised angioplasty, said: “All private hospitals are refusing admission saying they already have a huge load and oxygen supply is limited. I also tried government hospitals but there is a long waiting list.” Jamuna Prasad, (72), is suffering from bone tuberculosis and his surgery was scheduled at KGMU in the first week of April. The procedure was postponed due to the outbreak. “My condition is deteriorating. I can’t sleep due to pain and can’t even walk to the toilet. I can’t afford a private hospital,” he rued. SC Chowdhary (80) of Indiranagar said he had a history of bronchial asthma and used to visit his doctor every week for medical consultation. “When I visited my doctor’s clinic two days ago but I found it closed. When I called up the doctor, he asked me to bring a negative RT-PCR report for consultation,” he added. Ayodhya Prasad Verma (79) of Shaktinagar said, “I have acute joint pain and stiffness for a week. I went to KGMU but was told that OPD services have been closed and only teleconsultancy is available. Tell me, how will a doctor treat my condition over the phone?” Komal Vaid (50), a resident of Alambagh, said, “I took my mother-in-law for regular checkup as she has a history of diabetes and blood pressure but the doctor asked us to visit the next day as he was seeing limited patients due to Covid. It is risky for the elderly to step out of the house.” False Covid reports a cause of worry: False Covid-19 positive reports are also creating problems for the people. Rani Singh Chauhan (72) was getting dialysis at a private hospital for several months. Last week, she was found positive in the mandatory Covid test before admission. The hospital turned her away. “The hospital did not even provide us with the positive report. I somehow managed to get an appointment at SGPGI where Covid test through TrueNat machine showed I was negative,” she said. “The Institute did another test through RT-PCR which was also negative. It took 12 hours for the two tests and I had to wait for results while admitted in a Covid ward,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/non-covid-patients-suffer-amid-long-waiting-lists-in-city-hospitals/articleshow/82152577.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Peso not sharing data on oxygen, hospitals fume||Nagpur: Amid hospitals gasping for oxygen, Petroleum and Explosives and Safety Organization (Peso) — the central agency monitoring the situation in entire country — has refused to share the production data. Peso has its headquarter at Nagpur. TOI learnt that Peso has recently received a gag order from the ministry concerned. It has been directed to not share the details of production and supply of oxygen, except to the ministry. Peso maintains state-wise details on availability of the gas. Peso is the regulator of explosives and petroleum industry, which includes oxygen plans too. After the first wave of Covid, it was made one of the coordinating agencies for oxygen production and supply in the country. The agency comes under the department of promotion of industry and internal trade (DIPTIT). The department in turn is part of the ministry of industry and commerce headed by Piyush Goyal. The chief controller of explosives, MK Jhala, who is the head, Peso, at Nagpur, told TOI that there are strict instruction to only share the data with the ministry. Sources said the data is being sent to the ministry directly first so that it can be used for policy decisions, including fixing state-wise quota for oxygen supply. Hospitals have expressed displeasure over the move. “In times of a crisis such details must be easily available in public domain,” said an office-bearer of Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA). Meanwhile, oxygen shortage continued in the region. According to the data maintained by the state’s Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), as on Saturday, 135 metric tonne (MT) gas was produced by plants in Nagpur and Wardha. As against this there was a demand of 215 MT. Over 82 MT was sourced from Bhillai in Chhattisgarh to bridge the shortfall. The Nagpur division covers Nagpur, Wardha, Bhandara, Gondia, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli districts. In Amravati district, there is a shortfall of over 18 MT as against the supply which includes outsourced oxygen form Bhilai. The division includes Amravati, Akola, Yavatmal, Washim and Buldhana districts. The total demand in the districts is in the range of nearly 58 to 60 MT a day. As against this around, 48 MT is available. Not more than 11 to 12 MT a day is produced within the division. There are plants in Akola and Amravati. Rest of the quantity comes from outside including Bhilai, said the commissioner for Amravati division, Piyush Singh. The officer said it has been a tight-rope walk in the division. There were concerns that if the tanker did start from Bhilai in time on Monday, the balance stock could be exhausted by Tuesday morning. Finally, there was a confirmation that the tanker had started off from Bhilai. Last week, there was a crisis after the tanker meant from Amravati was diverted to Malegaon. The districts in the division depend on outside supply. Yavatmal depends on Wardha, Buldhana on Jalna apart from supplies coming from Nagpur too, said a source.

All those under home quarantine are being called and advised to take the walk test at their homes. While hospitals are facing a shortage of oxygen for critical patients, families of those under home isolation are also running around to buy and horde cylinders. In the walk test, a person has to note down his/her oxygen level using a finger pulse oximeter. Following the reading, the person has to do a moderate walk in the house (not climb stairs) for six minutes with the oximeter placed on the finger. After the six-minute walk, a fresh reading of the oxygen level has to be taken. The person needs to take medical help only if the oximeter reading is below 94. In a recent health review, state principal health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas emphasized the need to do the six-minute walk test. Home isolation patients were surprised to get calls to carry out the test since Sunday. They were told to do the test two to three times a day to help monitor oxygen levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-palghar-admin-for-6-min-walk-test-to-check-oxygen-level/articleshow/82152618.cms||---
---||Pune||State to push for permission to non-accredited laboratories for ramping up testing facilities||Pune: The state government has decided to push for permission to non-accredited laboratories for ramping up testing facilities. State health officials said that they would seek directions from the Union government in this regard. Recently, with mounting Covid-19 cases in the state, the state government has called upon laboratories offering mobile testing facilities to conduct RT-PCR tests. “The health department has invited applications from such laboratories to further ramp up testing. Since the last ten days, the state has been consistently adding over 60,000 Covid-19 positive cases. So far, over 2.38 crore tests have been carried out in the state,” officials said. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray recently called upon laboratories to submit reports within 24 hours. The Maharashtra Pathologists Association (MPA) said that nearly 5,000 non-accredited laboratories can be roped in to ramp up testing in the state. The association demanded that the Union government should allow non-accredited laboratories to carry out testing. The officials said that they had placed request earlier, too, but did not get response from the Centre, which has allowed only the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) to conduct both RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen Tests. Dr Sandeep Yadav, president, MPA, told TOI when the state is insisting on reports within 24 hours, there is an urgent need to involve these laboratories. “All these laboratories can ramp up, if required, and it can help increase testing. To start with, the Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) must be promoted and in suspected RAT negative patients with symptoms, RT-PCR tests can be carried out. RAT is sensitive and a fast testing method. These laboratories can either facilitate with RAT or RT-PCR, depending on the machines,” he said. The association members further added that authorities and administration must promote and facilitate early testing, which will reduce the burden on hospitals. “People can go for RAT first and then follow it up with RT-PCR, if needed. Early testing, oral medicines, home isolation can be followed to ease pressure off hospitals,” he added Senior IMA member and immediate past state president Dr Avinash Bhondwe said that these laboratories can be immediately given permission for RAT tests to help the overwhelmed laboratories. “This is the need of the hour at present and the state government should push for involvement of all these laboratories to help speed up testing,” said Dr Bhondwe. Considering the rise in cases, these laboratories should be given permission and centre can place conditions for the same, he said. According to data put out by the public health department, 71% RT-PCR and 28% antigen tests are being carried out at present. Last March, Pune’s National Institute of Virology was the only laboratory equipped to test for Sars-CoV-2 in samples. Since then, Maharashtra has scaled up its testing capacity tremendously from 339 laboratories in August to 476 in November and 487 in December. By March 2021, 524 laboratories were conducting tests in the city; of these, 383 are government-run. These tests include RT-PCR as well as antigen tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-to-push-for-permission-to-non-accredited-laboratories-for-ramping-up-testing-facilities/articleshow/82151534.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Hailed for playing a pivotal role in the aftermath of the 2013 Kedarnath tragedy — in rescue efforts as well as rehabilitation and rebuilding of Kedarnath — Kothiyal, who now runs an organisation that trains youngsters in the hills for joining the defence forces, is expected to help AAP make inroads in Uttarakhand, which has a strong presence of serving and retired defence personnel. Welcoming Kothiyal to the party fold, Delhi chief minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal, who was for the first time addressing party workers of all 70 assembly constituencies of the state virtually, described Kothiyal as “a true soldier”. “AAP will expose corruptions committed by both BJP and Congress regimes and write a new chapter in the development of Uttarakhand with the Colonel in the party fold,” said Kejriwal. “Uttarakhand faces serious challenges of unemployment and migration, which are the result of 20 years of corrupt rule by both BJP and Congress,” he added. “Together, we will create a new model of development for Devbhoomi. Uttarakhand has all the resources such as rivers, forests, mountains needed for the development,” Kejriwal further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/col-kothiyal-former-nim-principal-joins-aap-fold-kejriwal-says-new-model-of-development-will-be-created-for-uttarakhand/articleshow/82149553.cms||Gaurav Talwar

Instances of people visiting four to five centres, only to be turned away, came to light across the city. “I visited three top corporate hospitals for the second dose of Covishield vaccine, but they didn’t have stock. They asked me to come back on Tuesday afternoon, as they are expecting some stock by Tuesday morning. They were unable to say if I will get Covishield,” said Moin Khan, a beneficiary who tried his luck in the central part of the city. While some of the government vaccination centres continued with the vaccination drive on Monday, a majority of government centres in the city limits had limited stock and gave preference to beneficiaries who had come for the second dose.  “There is limited stock as of now, but vaccination drive was carried out on Monday. We are expecting stocks to be replenished by Tuesday morning,” said a source from the vaccination centre at the Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS). Sources at private and corporate hospitals, meanwhile, say that although the state has received 2.75 lakh doses on Sunday, they are yet to be distributed. “We had exhausted stocks three days ago and had to wrap up the vaccination drive within an hour on Thursday. Since Friday, we have not been carrying out vaccinations. We are told that the distribution is taking time, but the state already has the vaccines,” said an official from one of the corporate hospitals in the city. State health authorities meanwhile maintained that there are adequate stocks in the state that would last up to Wednesday and the distribution began on Sunday itself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/inoculation-drive-limps-due-to-vax-shortage-across-hyderabad/articleshow/82151530.cms||Amrita Didyala

The special ACB court also slapped a fine of Rs 60,000 upon the convict. Assistant director prosecution (ADP), ACB court, Kota, Ashok Kumar Joshi said that the court convicted ASI of Rajasthan police Narendra Kumar Sharma to three years of imprisonment in jail. A resident of Anta town of Baran district, Laturlal had lodged a complaint with ACB Baran on October 27, 2006, alleging that ASI Narendra Kumar Sharma of Anta police station demanded a bribe of Rs 2,000 to drop names of himself and his son in a case lodged against them by one Ramswaroop of the town and added the ASI also threatened to put them behind the bars if they did not pay the bribe, the ADP said. The ACB, Baran, following verification of the complaint laid a trap on October 30, 2006, and nabbed ASI Sharma red handed after he had accepted the bribe amount, which the ACB sleuth recovered from his possession, he further said. Special judge Pramod Kumar Malik on Monday held the ASI guilty of taking bribe despite being a public servant and convicted him to three years of imprisonment in jail, he said, and added the court also slapped a fine of Rs 60,000 upon the convict. Since the complainant and an independent witness, with the motive to slash the punishment to the accused in the crime, turned hostile during the trial of the case, the court also ordered to issue notices under Section 344 of CrPC to complainant Laturlal and the independent witness Brijmohan Malav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/3-year-jail-to-cop-for-accepting-bribe/articleshow/82151531.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Woman lends shoulder, free hearse for Covid victims||LUCKNOW: Patients and their attendants visiting Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital these days are coming across an unusual sight — a woman sitting in scorching heat, holding a placard with ‘Nishulk Shav Vahan’ (free hearse) written on it. As soon as she gets a call or a family approaches her, she takes out a van and ferries the body of deceased Covid patient to cremation ground for last rites. At a time when the kin and blood relatives of Covid-19 patients refrain from touching or cremating the bodies of their loved ones due to the fear of infection, a social worker, Versha Verma (42), has taken up the noble task of helping families cremate people who are succumbing to Covid-19 infection, that too free of cost. Versha, who runs a city-based NGO ‘Ek Koshish Aisi Bhi’, has been performing last rites and helping destitute and elderly people for the last three years. After losing her best friend to Covid a few days ago and waiting for several hours to get a hearse van for cremation, Versha decided that she would not let others suffer. What started as a social media post on Facebook asking for leads to rent a van for pick-and-drop of bodies, soon became a full-fledged service for Versha and two members of her team. “I posted a status on my Facebook wall asking for people who could help me get a van on rent. A few hours later, I recieved several phone calls and by the evening I managed to hire a vehicle. Later, my brother Hitesh Verma and I looked for a driver. As soon as we got a driver in our team, I started sitting at RML Hospital from Sunday morning. Initially, people gave confused looks but later some families came to seek help. Some patients had relatives who would accompany me to the cremation ground with some didn’t have anyone with them. We cremated five bodies on the first day and nine on the second day,” said Versha. Dressed in PPE kit, Versha and her team members visit the hospital or the house of the deceased and ferry the body to the cremation ground. They drop the family back to their house after the last rites are performed. “Since our childhood, we have been taught to pay respect to the dead. At a time when people are helpless and dying every hour, it is our way to pay respect to those who are falling prey to pandemic. Since Baikunth Dham is already crowded, we mostly go to Gulala Ghat for cremations. We have received a lot of help from workers there,” she said. Another member of her NGO, Deepak Mahajan, has also been contributing relentlessly to the mission. However, Mahajan himself is currently suffering from Covid-19 infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/woman-lends-shoulder-free-hearse-for-covid-victims/articleshow/82152614.cms||Aditi Singh
---||Lucknow||Families in home quarantine find it tough to procure grocery, medicines||LUCKNOW: Several families in the city, who have isolated themselves after one or more of their family members tested Covid-19 positive, are having a tough time in getting groceries and medicines. Vineeta Singh, a resident of Charbagh, said, “Our house was barricaded after my husband and I tested Covid positive on April 11. No grocery or general shop owner wants to home deliver products as our home has been declared a containment zone.” Families are finding it hard to get medicines. “My elder brother keeps the required medicines and other products at our doorstep before leaving for office in the morning. However, if we have any immediate requirement thereafter, nobody comes forward to help us,” said “ said Nikhil Chaurasiya, a resident of Manaknagar. Not just affected families, people living in the apartments where positive cases have been reported are facing problems. “After our apartment building was declared a containment zone after a family in the flats was found Covid-19 positive, maids have stopped coming and local shops in the vicinity are not ready to deliver products at home,” said Smita Upadhyay of Alambagh. Anand Kashyap, a resident of Jankipuram Sector-H, said, “Why should we suffer because our neighbours have tested positive? My father is diabetic and we order his medicine through a medical shop near our home. But, when we contacted him to deliver the medicines, he denied and said `sir please come to the shop to collect medicines’.” Complaints against ICCC galore: Lucknow: There were also a number of complaints regarding poor response from the Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) established by the district administration to assist patients in home isolation. Relatives of Covid-19 patients said that the ICCC is taking three-four days in contact tracing and delivering medicines. Avinash Bhatnagar, a resident of Jankipuram, said, “I called ICCC to help me in getting tested after my son turned Covid-19 positive on Monday. The operator told me that a team will come the next day for contact tracing and give medicines, but no one has reached us till date.” Aashee Singh of Yahiyaganj said, “She has high fever and has no smell or taste. We have kept him in isolation, but want to get her tested, but the contact number of ICCC always remains busy. We have no clue on how to deal with the situation,” said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/families-in-home-quarantine-find-it-tough-to-procure-grocery-medicines/articleshow/82152625.cms||Pranchal Srivastava

The drama started on Monday morning when an email from Justice Verma addressed to HCA president Mohammed Azharuddin said he was “giving up the post of ombudsman”. However, in another email later in the day, he “reiterated” that he intends to serve as ombudsman of HCA till my tenure ends. “Please find herewith the enclosed letter sent to me by R Vijayanand, secretary, intimating therein that two other learned judges have been appointed as ombudsman and ethics officer. In the light of this huge controversy, kindly spare me and I do not wish to get involved in this politics between the two factions,” Justice Verma said. The opposition circulated the mail widely. “Justice Verma’s mail was misunderstood by some members of the association,” Azharuddin later told TOI. “He never meant to give up on the post . His concern is that he is not dragged into the conflict between the two groups and, therefore, he had written to me about it,” Azhar added. The second email clarified Justice Verma’s stance. “My previous mail is not to be misinterpreted as I am still the ombudsman of HCA. The purpose of writing the previous mail was to let everyone know that I don’t want to get involved in the politics and tussle between the two groups and also not to approach me if there is any conflict between the two groups. I am in no way a party to the dispute or politics between the two factions and I urge everyone not to involve me in all this. Both the factions are free to approach the court of law and put their grievances before the court. I have nothing to do with this conflict,” he wrote. He also asserted that there is no going back on his decision to accept the post of HCA’s ombudsman. “I have re-assumed charge of ombudsman after going through the High Court order and after receiving an email dated 11.04.2021 from the president of HCA.” Azhar said that Justice Verma’s appointment was approved by show of hands, while the other group claimed that they have appointed Justice (retd) Nisar Ahmed Kakru as the ombudsman and Justice (retd) T Meena Kumari as the ethics officer after Azhar had walked out of the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/drama-as-verma-reassumes-charge-as-hca-ombudsman/articleshow/82151536.cms||Solomon S Kumar

They said that district collectors, during the closure of canal, should continuously monitor drinking water-related arrangements so that people do not face any problems. Both the officers, through video conference, addressed collectors, district administration, PHED, water resources department and IGNP officers of Sriganganagar, Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Barmer, Hanumangarh, Jhunjhunu, Jodhpur, Nagaur, Churu and Sikar on Monday. Jaisalmer district collector Ashish Modi confirming this, said that Jaisalmer is situated at the tail end of IGNP and with regard to canal closure, review was done about the preparations through VC. The closure of IGNP started in March and all water ponds were filled, due to which there is no shortage of water in the district. Now, for the supply of drinking water for May, water will be released in IGNP from April 25 to 28 and water tanks will be filled again. So, there will be no shortage of water in coming months. Sudhansh Pant and Naveen Mahajan praised the collectors of the concerned districts and both departments for the steps taken at their level. Pant said that with increase in temperatures and the situation that has arisen due to Covid, the coming times will be challenging, so the waterworks department and water resources department officers should remain vigilant and be responsible in managing drinking water. Pant said that the water works department, through a contingency plan, has already issued necessary sanctions for transportation of tankers in all districts for summer. Districts should get the approved works completed on time so that people are provided relief during summer. If any district requires an additional amount of work under the contingency plan, the proposal should be sent through the district collector. Mahajan directed the IGNP officers to ensure that repair and maintenance works of the canal are completed during the closure of canal, by May 30 and also directed officers to fill all water ponds. Mahajan said that this canal closure in IGNP is very important to all districts with regard to water security. The work done for strengthening the canal system will directly benefit the people for many years and with this, it will be possible to take additional water from Punjab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ensure-smooth-supply-of-drinking-water-dists-told/articleshow/82151540.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The mob went berserk as it wanted to avenge the attack on three persons for stealing mangoes from an orchard on previous day. Police said that Kalpesh Talaviya, Dinesh Hadpati and Tejas Chaudhary were allegedly beaten on April 17 for stealing mangoes from the orchard of one Nimesh Naik. On Sunday night, a mob of over 50 people was on its way to Naik’s house when police reached the village to avoid any untoward incident. “We requested them to lodge a complaint against the attackers, but they refused and were raging in anger,” said sub-inspector P H Kachhwaha of Gandevi police station. Additional force led by DySP S J Rana and Bilimora circle police inspector M B Rathod was called in to control the situation. “Senior officials tried to convince the group, but they refused to relent and instead hurled abuses at us and the attackers,” Kachhwaha added. As the cops too did not move from there, the group started pelting stones in which Rana suffered injuries on his head. As stone pelting continued, Kachhwaha and another sub-inspector fired four rounds from their service guns in the air. A few minutes later the mob dispersed and Rana had to be taken to hospital where he was administered three stitches. Other cops too suffered minor injuries. “We have detained 17 rioters and conducted their Covid-19 tests. Once their report arrives, we will formally arrest them,” said Rathod. Besides the 17 detainees, 30 to 40 unidentified persons have been booked for attempt to murder, rioting, assault, deterring public servant from performing duties and criminal conspiracies among other charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/fight-over-mango-theft-leads-to-rioting-in-navsari-village/articleshow/82151574.cms||---

About 50 teachers in various colleges are on leave after testing positive to coronavirus. Among the colleges where online teaching has been worst hit are Jai Narain PG College (JNPGC), Kalicharan PG College, Mahila Degree College, and Vidyant College. Anshu Kedia, general secretary of Lucknow Unversity Associated College Teachers’ Association (LUACTA), said, “In every college, at least two or three teachers are down with Covid. Teaching in subjects like education, anthropology, Hindi, which have limited number of teachers, has been badly impacted.” Also, some teachers succumbed to the virus, she added. “Two of our professors are seriously ill and admitted to hospitals while many are unwell. Since testing facilities are not easily available, the RT PCR reports many faculty members are awaited,” said KKC principal Prof Meeta Shah. A similar situation is prevailing in Vidyant Degree College. Principal Dharam Kaur said, “The situation is worrisome as many college teachers are infected. One of our lady professors lost her husband due to Covid and several others are recovering after getting infected.” LUACTA president Prof Manoj Pandey said, “About one-fourth of our teachers are infected. If the situation doesn’t improve teaching in colleges may get completely paralyzed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/teachers-in-pandemic-grasp-online-teaching-hit/articleshow/82152634.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The oxygen will then be transported to districts where there is an urgent demand in view of Covid-19. The first train left for Visakhapatnam. Central Railway chief spokesperson Shivaji Sutar said, “The state government had approached Railways to explore if liquid medical oxygen tankers could be moved by trains. We conducted a technical feasibility and will now allow the tankers to be transported through ro-ro service.” Route clearances have been taken, he said. As for tankers which bring oxygen by road, government allowed seamless and free movement of tankers carrying oxygen within state and inter-state, transporters said. All-India Motor Transport Congress chairman (core committee) Bal Malkit Singh said government exempted registration of permits for tankers moving inter-state and carrying medical oxygen. “Government has allowed nitrogen tankers to be converted into oxygen tankers to overcome any shortage,” he said, adding that this will now ensure tankers move round-the-clock and there is no short supply of medical oxygen at hospitals. The drivers will work in shifts to ensure faster turnaround and adequate capacity to meet the surge in demand. “Many drivers wanted to migrate back to their villages as few colleagues contracted Covid, and they were scared. But we motivated drivers who are healthy and Covid negative with higher incentives and assured medical support. Even drivers have been kept on standby so that vehicles, especially those carrying oxygen, are on the move,” Singh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-train-with-tankers-starts-journey-from-state-to-pick-up-oxygen/articleshow/82152629.cms||Somit Sen

Right from MLA Krishna Khopde to former energy minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule to ex-mayor Pravin Datke alleged that the state government has failed to handle the Covid-19 crisis because of its ‘short-sightedness’. Speaking to TOI, Bawankule said that Nagpur did not get any new stock of Remdesivir on Sunday. “I checked with my sources in Thane, and apparently they are getting regular supply whereas patients in Nagpur are being made to run from pillar to post for the same. Bulk of the drugs seem to be getting diverted to Thane and Mumbai due to ‘political clout’. Also the shortage of beds, oxygen cylinders etc. is visible and is resulting in the deaths of people,” said Bawnkule. In a statement, Khopde said, “As per the current Epidemic Act in effect, the local authorities have lot of power to implement things. But still, they are not doing enough to prepare the infrastructure required to deal with this second wave.” Bawankule said that starting new Covid care facilities is neither costly, nor difficult. “We have so many BAMS doctors available in the district and the administration is not utilizing this amazing resource. It takes just around Rs 2.5 crore to set up a 50-bed hospital with oxygen concentrators in a hotel. All private hotels must be taken over by the local authorities and converted into health care facilities,” said Bawankule. Regarding funds, the former Nagpur guardian minister said that there is “enough lying around”. Bawankule said, “There is a huge corpus of Rs 100 crore in the mining fund with the district collector. This is replenished regularly through royalty received from mining operations. By using this fund we can immediately convert 40 hotels into Covid Care Centres of 50 beds each.” Bawankule said his party will intensify the agitation against the government if immediate steps are not taken to improve the situation in Nagpur. “For Remdisivir, if Thane politicians can ensure that their hospitals are getting enough supply then the same can be done for Nagpur as well. We are not saying that you deny this vital drug to patients there, but at least give Nagpurians their faire share,” said Bawankule.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-leaders-stage-sit-down-protest-at-the-collectorate/articleshow/82150425.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan govt confused over imposition of curfew: Gajendra Singh Shekhawat||JODHPUR: Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on Monday came down heavily on the Gehlot government’s ‘confusion’ over imposition of curfew in the state. Mincing no words, Shekhawat said those who condemned the nationwide lockdown last year during the first wave are confused about its imposition despite their wish. “They are realising the importance of lockdown, but are not able to take any decision,” he said pointing to the ‘Jan Anushasan Pakhwada’ announced by the Gehlot government from Monday to May 3. Shekhawat, who was in Jodhpur on Monday after his long stint of campaigning in West Bengal, was talking to reporters after holding a review meeting with the officials and medical experts. Tossing a question at chief minister Ashok Gehlot, Shekhawat asked whether all the vaccines sent on time were used judiciously. He also sought reply on how many of these vaccines were wasted and how many were stolen, referring to Gehlot’s allegation about short supply of vaccines to the state by the central government. Terming the present situation of in the country as an emergency like situation, he said that it was not the time to engage into petty politics. He said that he had asked the administrative officials about their needs in fighting this menace. “The DM has apprised me about the shortage of oxygen and pulse oximeters. I have arranged 200 cylinders from Bangur Cement and have assured him of help in other matters also,” he said. Referring to Rahul Gandhi’s tweet stating that he had decided to drop all his rallies in WB in view of the critical surge of Covid in the country, the minister took a jibe at Gandhi, “I wanted to know how many rallies he had already held there and how many were scheduled in future.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-govt-confused-over-imposition-of-curfew-shekhawat/articleshow/82151542.cms||---

The rural areas have recorded a 38% positivity rate since the beginning of April, which is higher than 25% in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits and 27% in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) areas. The rural areas reported 46,500 new Covid-19 cases between April 1 and April 18. The PMC and the PCMC areas, on the other hand, added 97,800 and 43,608 new cases during the same period. The overall addition in Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) was 1.88 lakh. A senior Pune zilla parishad official said the cases were coming from the “concentrated pockets” where the containment efforts were on. He said 33% gram panchayats have not reported Covid-19 cases during the recent spike. Pune ZP chief executive officer Ayush Prasad said, “Most cases are coming from the peri-urban pockets and those nearer to the highways. Around 214 gram panchayats have reported the new cases. However, the number of such gram panchayats was 234 eight days ago. The situation is under control and we are taking necessary.” The officer added that the rural parts have a small base of cases as compared to the municipal coporation limits. “The increase in cases, hence, appears to be higher,” Prasad said. A PMC health department official said, “The cases have been on the rise since the past one month. The daily caseload has reached around 5,000, while the daily testing has also been increased to 20,000.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rural-cantt-areas-register-higher-spike-than-civic-limits/articleshow/82151551.cms||Sarang Dastane

These birds are seen nesting here for their breeding season. Movement of a large number of vultures can be seen at Delasar, Basanpeer Degrai and other pasture lands, some 30-40km from Jaisalmer district headquarters. White Rumped vultures are seen nesting here for the breeding season. Bird expert Radheyshyam Pemani said that with the onset of summer, the birds’ breeding season starts and migratory birds including Kurja have left for breeding grounds and many local birds have started nesting for breeding. Many migratory birds including Kurja spend time breeding at Mangolia, mid Asia, southern Russia and eastern Europe, raising their chicks. When the chicks grow by August, these birds come to India prior to the start of winter. He said that at Delasar, Basanpeer etc., species of resident vultures and migratory vultures can be seen nesting. Two days ago, rare species of White Rumped vultures, whose population is continuously declining, were seen here which is a good sign. In the year 2000, a large number of vultures had died and IUCN had put them in the red list. Apart from this, many other species can be seen nesting here. Bird watcher, expert and environmentalist Dr Divesh Saini said that many migratory and resident species of rare birds were seen at Degrai pasture land of Jaisalmer. This is a very good sign from an environmental point of view. He said that a large number of Kurja have left from here but still, a few of them and other migratory and rare birds can be seen near the water bodies. He said that these birds cover a distance of 5,000-7,000km in 15 days and cross borders of various countries. He said, “The White Rumped vulture (Gyps bengalensis) was once one of the most abundant resident vulture species. Over the last three decades, their numbers have drastically reduced. Steps like banning diclofenac for veterinary purposes have suddenly declined. Few villages near Jaisalmer have nesting populations and are being monitored regularly around the city regularly.” According to surveys by local birders, 7 species out of 9 vultures are seen in Jaisalmer district, 3 of which are winter migrants — griffon vulture, himalayan vulture & cinereous vulture. This season, all migratory species arrived in record numbers in comparison to previous years as a good population of vultures need a healthy environment to recycle dead carcasses of animals with the start of summer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/many-migratory-birds-staying-back-in-jaisalmer/articleshow/82151557.cms||---

A total of three exporters have now been given emergency approval to sell the injection in the state. Last week, the state FDA had granted similar nod to BDR Pharmaceuticals and Bruck Pharma for the sale of remdesivir to licensed stockists and Covid hospitals in Maharashtra. Confirming the decision, FDA commissioner Abhimanyu Kale told TOI: “In view of the pandemic situation and shortage of remdesivir, we have given emergency approval to these companies for making and sale of remdesivir. ...Since exports have been halted by the Centre, vials available with them can be used in the country.” The state FDA’s emergency approval to Nixi Labs stated: “You are directed to distribute this stock on priority basis in Maharashtra only for government supply and not for any private sale or distribution or any non-government organisation considering the emergency and very high demand due to the Covid-19 pandemic.” Last week, the state Directorate of Medical Education and Research had placed an order to buy five lakh vials from BDR Pharma, but the exporter had said that they won’t be able to supply the vials since they were not authorised to sell the drug in India on their own. Sameer Shah of BDR Pharmaceuticals had said in a statement, “We are not authorised to supply in the domestic market, except through our licensed and approved partners. We are working continuously to ensure that our licensed partners do not suffer any delay or stoppage of supplies of Inj. Remdesivir for their distribution network.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/3rd-exporter-gets-fda-nod-for-remdesivir-sale-in-maharashtra/articleshow/82152639.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Nagpur||Relatives of home isolated patients denied Oxygen refilling||NAGPUR: Harried kin of Covid patients on Monday gathered at the district collector’s office complaining that they had been denied oxygen refill from private bottlers who cited an order from the collector himself and refused to supply. With no hospital bed available, the patients were kept at home after arranging an oxygen cylinder on the basis of doctors’ advice, the kin said. Each of them showed a doctor’s prescription which read ‘patient needs oxygen support’. On Monday, the bottlers told them a recent order says that fresh supplies can only be made after a permission from the collector. Majority of them had gone to Bhartia Medicare, an oxygen bottling unit at Pili Nadi. There was police at the office and none was allowed to wait, said those who had gathered at the collector’s office. Shoaib Ansari had moved his brother out of hospital after the family was not able to bear the expenses anymore. “We had ended up paying Rs4.5 lakh. So, after consulting the doctor, he was taken home and an oxygen cylinder was arranged. It needs to be refilled daily. But on Monday, we were turned back from the refiller’s premises,” he said. Deputy collector Avinash Katade said there was no such order. “Rather, they are the most needy. The patients have been kept at home because there are no beds in the hospital. There must have been some rumour on social media,” he said. However, a representative of Bhartia Medicare shared an order dated Aril 15. The order did not mention that permission was needed for a refill. It had a list of suppliers and vendors. There were directives that hospitals should only get their supply from vendors mentioned against theirs in the list. According to Bhartia Medicare, the order meant only those hospitals mentioned against the refillers’ name in the list have to be supplied and not others. The official said a standard operating procedure (SOP) needs to be laid down for oxygen supply for home refills. The official said there were concerns of supplies being diverted. He accepted of having asked for a police protection. O2 cylinder taken away BC Bhartia, the proprietor of Bhartia Medicare, claimed on Monday night one of the vehicles heading to a hospital was stopped midway and an oxygen cylinder was taken away. “The people who stopped the vehicle also replaced it with an empty cylinder. With such threats, the system of oxygen supply needs to be streamlined,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/relatives-of-home-isolated-patients-denied-o2-refilling/articleshow/82151622.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Jaipur||Union heath minister’s response to ex-PM unfortunate, condemnable: CM Ashok Gehlot||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday lashed out at Union health minister Harsh Vardhan for his ‘politically motivated’ response to Manmohan Singh’s critique of the Centre’s Covid-19 management, as ‘unfortunate and condemnable’. He said former PM Manmohan Singh had written to his successor Narendra Modi giving positive suggestions about vaccination in the public interest and there was no criticism of the government. “It is unfortunate and condemnable on part of the Union health minister to have written a politically motivated reply to the former prime minister,” he tweeted. “Any suggestion given by any person or political party to the central government is treated as criticism and is not tolerated. It seems they know, they have committed grave mistakes and are guilt-ridden,” he said. Singh on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Modi suggesting five measures to battle the Covid crisis, including ramping up vaccination and boosting the supply of medicines. Responding to Singh’s letter, Vardhan alleged the second wave of the pandemic was instead fuelled by Congress-ruled states as they were busy raising doubts about vaccines rather than vaccinating people. The letter drafters of the senior Congress leader have done a great disservice to his standing, he said. Tweeting the letter to Singh, the health minister said, “History shall be kinder to you Dr Manmohan Singh ji if your offer of ‘constructive cooperation’ and valuable advice was followed by your @INCIndia leaders as well in such extraordinary times!” “The reply to letter written by Dr Manmohan singh ji to Central Govt, is politically motivated and full of Arrogance and Ignorance. The letter was written keeping public interest in mind whereas this reply proves BJP is keen on fighting @INCIndia rather than COVID,” tweeted Congresss state president Govid Singh Dotasra. Gehlot also accused the Union health minister of misleading people on the availability of vaccines. “It is unfortunate that the minister gives false statements on the issue of availability of vaccines. The reality is that the Government of India has failed to ensure an uninterrupted supply of adequate vaccines to the states,” he said The chief minister said Rajasthan has vaccine stock sufficient only for two to three days. He also reiterated that the prime minister should cancel his political programmes and hold regular dialogues with the chief ministers to know the ground situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/union-heath-ministers-response-to-ex-pm-unfortunate-condemnable-cm/articleshow/82151585.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: It’s parents v/s schools over fees before reopening||MUMBAI: As schools prepare for the new academic year, parents of several students are once again at loggerheads with school managements over fees. While the educational institutes have cancelled rollbacks or hiked their fees, parents want concessions, considering that physical classes are still to resume. A group of parents from Podar International School in Powai have alleged that the school has brought in a fee hike for the upcoming academic year. “The school has hiked the fee in the middle of the pandemic when parents are facing financial trouble. The school is also imposing a fine of Rs 200 per day in case of non-payment. When we asked the school for a rollback, they denied access to digital learning for students,” said a parent. The school, on its part, said that it had not restricted access to learning and added that it was only implementing an old fee hike. “As a support to our parents, the school deferred the PTA-approved fee hike from the year 2020-21 to 2021-22. The school remains in full compliance with all government- and high court-mandated fee guidelines. The school is providing comprehensive virtual classes and conducting online exams for all students, irrespective of fee payment,” the school said in an email response to TOI. Parents from Bhaktivedanta School in Andheri approached the education department with a similar complaint. The department then issued a notice to the school, demanding its response. The parents alleged that fees had been hiked for the upcoming academic year from Rs 83,000 last year to Rs 1.1 lakh. “If they could manage with Rs 83,000 last year, why not this year too, considering that physical classes haven’t resumed and many parents continue to face financial difficulties?” said a parent. The school’s principal, Armaity Engineer, however said that last year the school had rolled back the hike approved in 2019 and was going to continue to provide concession with respect to food fees. Last year, amid the pandemic, the education department issued a government resolution on May 8, asking schools not to hike fees. The government resolution was stayed by the Bombay high court after private school owners filed a petition. The court recently vacated the stay, but said that the resolution would not be applicable to schools which had decided their fees before it was issued, and in accordance with the rules by the fee act. The state’s education department recently received 2,825 suggestions through a portal for changes in the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act, 2011.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-its-parents-v/s-schools-over-fees-before-reopening/articleshow/82152641.cms||Vinamrata Borwankar

Gehlot was reviewing the construction works of the HPCL Rajasthan Refinery Limited (HRRL) project on Monday. He said that the corona pandemic might have some adverse impact on the operations of this ambitious project, but HPCL officials should increase resources and give it momentum. The CM directed the officers to resolve pending issues and matters at department level by coordinating with project officials at the earliest.

The foundation, which came to the rescue of about 40,000 people by providing food for 108 days at a stretch during the first wave of Covid-19, has once again started reaching out to those in need. It is providing 200 meals per day. “Our initiative has received tremendous response,” said TSV Prasad, president, VBG Foundation, adding that they had to stop registrations soon after they opened up as they could provide food to only 200 people per day. Prasad said that they started diverting those in need to other food providers as they reached the limit. “More than preparing food, transportation has become an issue. During the first wave, we used to zero in on four to five localities per day and used to go there and provide food. But now, people are scattered at different locations,” he added. While the food is provided free of cost, the foundation said that the transportation has to be borne by the beneficiary. The meal offered comprises rice, roti, dal, curry, pickle and curd. The VBG foundation was started amid lockdown. It has about 100 members. Apart from food, it provided books to children, essentials to shelter homes etc. In 2020, the foundation worked with GHMC and police to provide food to the needy. “We opted for the foundation instead of buying food from a hotel as it is home-cooked and made in a hygienic environment. The quantity is also sufficient,” said Ch Ashok, a software employee from Madinaguda, who received three meals — for his daughter, wife and himself, on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/foundation-serves-200-meals-a-day-to-needy/articleshow/82151619.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

On Monday around 12.45 am, Lucknow police commissioner DK Thakur received a frantic call of help from Pulse Hospital and Trauma Centre in Vrindavan Yojna area. The hospital said it had 11 critical Covid patients, but was running out of oxygen supply. The existing stock wouldn’t last for more than an hour, the hospital doctor said, adding that despite contacting sources, oxygen cylinders could not be arranged. Realising that the lives of 11 patients were in danger, CP Thakur directed his sub-inspector (media cell) Nitin Yadav to help arrange oxygen cylinders at the hospital. Nitin Yadav with the help of his other batchmates coordinated with suppliers at Nadarganj and requested for some cylinders. The cops arranged 11 cylinders and delivered them to the hospital in the nick of time. The hospital doctor and kin of the patients were at loss of words to thank the police team. For Nitin Yadav, this has not been the first instance of going beyond the call of duty and helping people. Yadav told TOI that he has purchased three oxygen cylinders. “If anybody asks for help from the police then I ensure that it is reached to the person concerned in any place of Lucknow. I also appeal to the hospitals which are lying defunct during Covid-19 times to lend Lucknow police those cylinders we will purchase to get it refilled and help those in need,” he said.

As many as 65 cases were reported in the district on Monday and 85 cases were reported on Sunday. In the last four days, total cases have gone to 240 in the district with a relatively low population, after which the district administration is taking many steps. The district administration is making arrangements for treatment of corona-positive patients at every level. District collector Ashish Modi inspected Jawahar Hospital and directed to increase the existing 40 dedicated beds to 80 beds. In what comes as a relief, now the oxygen plant at Jawahar Hospital has started functioning. Modi during his visit to the government hospital, asked to arrange 50 beds dedicated to Covid. He also visited the wards and the surgical and orthopaedic wards will be shifted to trauma centre. He also directed to make arrangements for dedicated treatment of Covid. With the oxygen plant starting at the hospital, patients will get oxygen in time, without any hassles. Modi also directed the municipal council commissioner to get the dedicated ward painted and cleaned.

At the Jawahar Hospital, two side arrangements have been made for oxygen supply. At a prescribed place under centralised arrangement, oxygen will be supplied by connecting pipelines with oxygen cylinders at MCHN and other wards, and will then be supplied to the beds for the patients. Earlier, oxygen cylinders were filled from Barmer but now, with the oxygen generator plant and centralized oxygen supply system here, there will be availability of oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cases-spiral-in-jaisalmer-admn-amplifies-efforts/articleshow/82151597.cms||---
---||Delhi||Look into shortage of oxygen, give bed status: Delhi HC to Centre||NEW DELHI: Alarmed at the scale of Covid-19 spread and the damage it’s causing, Delhi High Court on Monday revived its monitoring of the issue and said “it is evident that the healthcare infrastructure is at the stage of imminent collapse”. A concerned bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli also directed the Centre to look into the aspect of shortage of oxygen supply in certain Delhi hospitals, including Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH) , on an urgent basis. Meanwhile, after the AAP government flagged the issue, the bench directed a private oxygen supplier, Inox, to restore supply of 140 metric tonnes as per its contractual commitment to the city so that the government can then redistribute it to the needy hospitals. Delhi government alleged that suddenly the company had cut short the supply and diverted it to another state from its quota. Taking stock of the Covid-19 testing capacity and infrastructure, the court noted that the virus has raised its “ugly head” once again and the pandemic is raging with much greater intensity. It directed both the Centre and Delhi government to file affidavits by Tuesday disclosing hospital-wise availability of beds for Covid patients, including how many hospital beds are with or without ventilators and oxygen support. During the hearing, the court also took exception to the threat by Delhi government of cancellation or suspension of licence of labs that delayed furnishing report in 24 hours. The bench said it cannot appreciate this stand of the government. “We therefore direct that if such a direction is issued, it shall not be implemented,” it said, adding that “because of this direction, labs are not willing to collect samples if they are unable to deliver reports in 24 hours. If any such action is taken by the government, it will only be counter productive. We have to be clear that labs are also hard pressed because of the large numbers they are receiving. It will not serve the interest of any laboratory to negligently or deliberately delay the test result.” It, however, asked the labs to work efficiently and diligently and generate reports as soon as possible. Petitioner advocate Rakesh Malhotra highlighted before the court that oxygen stock is precariously low at SGRH and sought Centre’s intervention. Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing Delhi government, assured the court that in the current situation the government will like to carry all stakeholders together and it will not do anything which will create obstacles in the labs’ work. The court also reminded both the Centre and AAP government of their obligation to the migrant workers, cautioning against any repeat of last year’s misery. It directed the state government to provide food to daily wagers at their work sites and to utilise the service of contractors who used to prepare midday meals in schools, while using money from the Rs 3000-crore Building and Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Fund.

The rural local crime branch (LCB) sleuths on Monday arrested two accused, one of them allegedly in extra-marital affair with Thakore’s wife, for the murder.The accused duo, identified as Sachin Parmar and Sagar Parmar, both residents of Dharampur, killed Thakore with a knife and iron pipes. The police said that Sachin was in a relationship with Thakore’s wife Riddhi for last two years. “They used to meet and interact regularly but Atul wasn’t aware of it. Riddhi used to tell Sachin that her husband had a violent nature and that he used to beat her often. This angered Sachin who planned to bump off Thakore,” said J D Sarvaiya, police sub-inspector, taluka police station.Sachin teamed up with his friend Sagar and both decided to murder Thakore, a driver by profession, on Saturday evening. “The accused duo planted two iron pipes at the spot where they had planned to kill Thakore. On Saturday afternoon, Sachin called Thakore and planned to go for a long drive,” Sarvaiya added.Thakore left his home in his four-wheeler and picked up Sachin and Sagar on the way. The accused duo took him to the spot and began assaulting him. While Sachin hit Thakore with iron pipe, Sagar stabbed him with a pocket knife. After disposing off his body in the bushes, the accused removed Thakore’s gold chain and two finger-rings worth Rs 2.25 lakh and fled in his car.Some passer-by spotted Thakore’s body on Saturday night and informed the police. Thakore’s family members, who had been searching for him, identified his body following which a case of murder was filed at taluka police station. The cops learnt that Thakore’s mother was booked under the Prohibition Act in the past so they tried to ascertain if her background had anything to do with the murder.“During investigations, we learnt about Thakore’s wife’s affair with Sachin following which we picked him up. After some detailed questioning, he admitted to have committed the murder. We have recovered Thakore’s car and gold ornaments from the accused,” Sarvaiya said. The police said that prima facie, they haven’t found Riddhi’s involvement in the crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/wifes-paramour-his-friend-held-for-murder-of-husband/articleshow/82151630.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The Army officials are calling it a physical casualty as he was not killed in action. His mortal remains will be cremated on Tuesday morning after being brought from J&K where he was posted in 12 Rashtriya Rifles. The deceased soldier was to get married next month. Hanuman Choudhary (24), who hailed from Peeplu in Tonk district had joined the Indian Army in 2016. Sources claimed that the soldier died due to a bullet wound though officials did not confirm it to be a suicide. The Army will also investigate the death. His relative Khushiram Jat told TOI, “We had spoken to Hanuman on Friday. He was supposed to come on leave next week as he was to get married on May 14. We just know that he died due to a bullet wound and nothing else. Once the mortal remains arrive, we should get more details.” Choudhary was the youngest of the three siblings and his eldest brother is also serving in the Army. At present the brother is on leave. The deceased’s family is in a state of shock and puzzled about the death. They claimed that while talking to them on the phone Choudhary did not mention any issues that he was facing. “There was nothing wrong when his brother spoke to him. We are all shocked. I could not even reach the village due to the curfew. We are awaiting more details as to what transpired before Hanuman’s death,” said another relative of the deceased. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot and other leaders condoled the soldier’s death. Just last month, an Army jawan was killed in action in Ladakh on March 1 as he got buried beneath a tank after the vehicle fell into a ditch. The deceased soldier was a part of an Armoured Corps regiment and hailed from Jhunjhunu. He is succeeded by wife and two children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/soldier-from-tonk-becomes-physical-casualty-in-jk/articleshow/82151625.cms||---

In a letter to CEO, Railway Board, Sunita Sharma, UP additional chief secretary Awanish Awasthi on Sunday sought transportation of LMO from oxygen plants based in Jamshedpur and Bokaro in Jharkhand and Rourkela (Odisha) through Oxygen Express. TOI has a copy of the letter. The entire operation will be monitored from Lucknow. According to railway officials, three stations – Lucknow, Faizabad and Varanasi – have been chosen where LMO tankers will be alighted. Railway authorities confirmed that 400 empty oxygen cylinders would be moved from Kandla (Gujarat) to Varanasi in new modified goods (NMG) wagons. Talking to TOI, additional chief secretary, information, Navneet Sehgal said, “We are working on the consignment’s manifest and itinerary. The state will receive oxygen supply soon.” Divisional railway manager, Northern Railway, Sanjay Tripathi said the infrastructure was ready and teams were on standby. “As soon as the UP government places order for LMO or oxygen cylinders, we will start operation. The roll-on roll-off service is very effective, fast and cheap. Special green corridor will be created for oxygen express for non-stop operation.” Railway has directed all its zones to prepare special stations with ramps with the capacity to handle 40 tons of weight at a time. According to a letter dated April 16, Railway Board has asked all zones and divisions not to levy busy season and development charges on the consignment. However, GST and other surcharges will be charged for the service. The persons accompanying trucks will have to purchase second class ticket for the journey. Maximum two persons per truck will be allowed. Security of trucks with locks and lashes will be ensured by the customer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-seeks-rlys-help-to-transport-oxygen-from-jkhand-odisha/articleshow/82152647.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||Pune||Six-minute walk crucial tool for Covid patients in home care: ExpertsIt Assesses If A Mild Covid Patient Is Likely To Develop Severe Illness||Pune: A simple six-minute walk test needs to be revived and reinforced for mild Covid cases as 80% of the patients are currently in home isolation in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR), experts have said. The test looks for inducible hypoxia (low oxygen in the blood) in a patient. It helps in early detection of the condition and initiate timely care by shifting the patient to a hospital before his/her condition worsens. However, most patients in home care rely mainly on oximetry test at rest to gauge blood oxygen levels and ignore doing it before and after a six-minute walk. “I have seen quite a few mild Covid cases in home isolation presenting with moderate to severe lung involvement as they tend to ignore the six-minute walk before conducting the oximetry test to assess the lung reserve. Perhaps, they have not been sensitized enough about its importance,” senior physician Vilas Gundecha, who is also the chief intensivist at Inlaks and Budhrani Hospital, said. The state government, in its renewed guidelines issued on March 23, 2021, has also highlighted the importance of conducting the six-minute walk test for patients at Covid Care Centres (CCCs). “We need to use CCCs more effectively by making six-minutes walk test in the morning and evening universal. Also, four hourly measurements of temperature and oxygen saturation should be done for early detection of any severity,” said Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary (health), state government, said. One of the main manifestations of Covid-19 is the varying degree of involvement of the lung causing a spectrum of illnesses from mild lower respiratory tract infection to severe Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). “One of the important clinical parameters is to identify hypoxia early to initiate a higher level of care at the earliest. Many times, a patient can still have low oxygen (hypoxia) even when s/he is not breathless,” said critical care expert Kapil Borawake, director of the ICU at Vishwaraj hospital. However, the presence of silent or latent hypoxia has made this task a challenge in Covid-19. “Hence, doing the oximetry test before and after the six-minute walk within the residence or CCC can pick up patients likely to land with breathing difficulty. If a patient shows a drop of six points in blood oxygen saturation levels immediately after taking six minutes walk, then s/he should immediately be shifted to a hospital for early care,” said critical care expert Subhal Dixit, chief of the Sanjeevan hospital. 5% CASES TEND TO TURN CRITICAL The Covid-19 cases are typically classified as mild, severe, and/or critical A majority of these patients (81%) have uncomplicated or mild illness: non-pneumonia or mild pneumonia About 14% develop a severe illness with blood oxygen saturation dropping below 93%, requiring oxygen therapy Around 5% patients develop a critical illness with respiratory failure, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction requiring ICU care RISK STRATIFICATION The median time from symptom onset to the development of pneumonia is approximately five days and that from symptom onset to severe hypoxemia and ICU admission is typically between 7 and 12 days Therefore, there is a window of opportunity, albeit for a short period of a few days, before the onset of severe symptoms to allow for risk stratification SIX-MINUTE WALK Wear clothes that are comfortable Use usual walking aids like a cane or walker, if needed It is okay to eat a light meal prior to the test Take usual medications and calculate the blood oxygen saturation prior to the walk and immediately after the walk using an oximeter Walk at your normal pace - back and forth - within your home for six minutes If there is a drop of more than six points compared with counts pre-walk, consult your doctor immediately Any drop in blood oxygen saturation below 93% at rest or after a six-minute walk, needs a doctor’s consultation QUOTE The simple tool has immense clinical applicability to ensure safe care of Covid-19 patients at home.

The state government has made Covid negative report mandatory for travellers from other states. But many of them do not get the test done before entering the state. Health minister Raghu Sharma said a lot of people are entering the state without Covid negative report. “For such people, we have decided to conduct antigen test on the border. They will have to wait for some time till the result comes,” said Sharma. The state government is taking all possible measures to increase the capacity of RT-PCR tests in the state. “We will soon be able to increase our testing capacity from 70,000 to 1 lakh,” he said. The state government has directed the village committees to ensure that those coming from other states should stay under home quarantine for 14 days like they had done during the first wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rapid-antigen-test-for-travellers-coming-from-other-states/articleshow/82151626.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Amid bed shortage, scarcity of crucial drugs delaying discharge||NAGPUR: The acute short supply of crucial drugs like Remdesivir and Tocilizumab in particular and other injectables due to high demand has led to a slow recovery rate as treating doctors are compelled to compromise on doses even for admitted moderate to severe patients. The slow recovery rate has also pushed up the period of bed occupancy at hospitals, aggravating the shortage of beds. Though the experts often attribute the slow recovery to the new strain of the virus that causes Covid-19, they are also equally agreeing with the fact that the shortage of drugs has left the patients in lurch. The course of treatment had to be modified by prescribing the available drugs, often leading to a delayed and even incomplete recuperation, they said. The statistics shared by the district information office also underlined the fact that during the period of drug shortage there had been an increase in number of patients in hospitals. Till the midnight of April 14, there had been 13,672 patients in different Covid hospitals, which increased to 14,079 on April 15. After a brief drop on April 16, there was another leap the following day with 15,247 patients in hospital. The number further increased to 20,246 as on April 18. Dr Pinak Dande of the Dande Hospital said the patients cannot be discharged or are not willing to take discharge until and unless they feel cured and safe. “Without completion of the treatment course, the patients are not cured and are also not safe to be discharged,” he said. “The patient feels psychologically unsafe if a crucial drug like Remdesivir is not being administered as per the treatment guidelines. The shortage of these drugs leads to delayed treatment and so the discharge is also stretched,” said Dr Dande. Dr Nandu Kolwadkar, in-charge of Covid at Orange City Hospital, said that a modified treatment of administering two doses of Remdesivir has been formulated in the backdrop of the shortage. “The scarcity of drug like Tocilizumab has led to a hurdle in fighting inflammation,” he said. “Various kinds of injectables are used for treating Covid but not all are equally easily available. This year our discharge rate has fallen considerably as comparison to last year due to delayed treatment owing to drug shortage,” he said. Dr Anup Marar, convener of Vidarbha Hospitals Association, said the patients refuse to get discharged until complete doses of drugs like Remdesivir is given. “But the drug is in short-supply,” he said. In the meanwhile, district collector Ravindra Thakare has suggested the hospitals and doctors not to issue prescriptions for Remdesivir, which is being distributed by his office, and Tocilizumab. He has also urged the oxygen suppliers to first deliver at the Covid hospitals and then to the patients isolated at home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/amid-bed-shortage-scarcity-of-crucial-drugs-delaying-discharge/articleshow/82151641.cms||Soumitra Bose

In a letter to the principal secretary, home, Abhay Kumar, Rajasthan Petroleum Dealers’ Association said that the guidelines were contradictory. “Most of the goods trucks are plying on the highways during night. By closing the petrol pumps it will create problems for such services which are allowed in the guidelines. That’s why we urge the government to permit the petrol pumps to remain open during night as well,” said Suneet Bagai, president of the association. He said that it is not the goods trucks that require fuel at night. “There are ambulances, police vehicles, private vehicles as in emergency situations individuals need to go out, buses and other vehicles also need fuel at night,” added Bagai. He added that the nature of business at petrol pumps is such that there is always social distancing and that is the reason there have been not many cases involving people in the service. Also, the fact that when the transporters know that the fuel pumps in Rajasthan are closed, they fill their tanks in other states which is causing losses to the state exchequer as well. “Fuel is an essential service which is required round-the-clock and we want the government to rectify the anomaly in the guidelines,” said Bagai. Bagai said that the current guidelines are in the nature of partial lockdown as many services are allowed to function normally. “In curfew situations, the petrol pumps remain closed, but this is not curfew. That’s another reason why they should operate round-the-clock,” said Bagai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/keep-fuel-pumps-open-round-the-clock-dealers-to-govt/articleshow/82151624.cms||---

Tbe plant was under the state government’s control during the first wave of Covid and the state did not face any shortage. “The Centre has taken all the oxygen generation plants under its control in addition to its distribution. Now, Gujarat and Rajasthan has the same number of cases, but Gujarat is getting 1,200 metric tonnes while in Rajasthan they are supplying 124 metric tonnes. Oxygen is required in Covid treatment. Beds have been increased and if we do not have oxygen, how will we be able to save the lives,” said Sharma. The state government has decided to procure 1,500 oxygen concentrators, each of which will produce 10KL of oxygen. “The oxygen produced by 1,500 oxygen concentrators will be provided to 3,000 patients,” he said. He also flayed the Centre for not supplying Covid vaccines in sufficient quantity, which are required in the state. “After sending letters to PM, we managed to get 10 lakh doses and four more doses were supplied to us yesterday. We have 14 lakh doses and we have the capacity of vaccinating 7 lakh doses per day. In two days, the stock will be exhausted, if we vaccinate as per our capacity.

Leela Parmar, a resident of Adas village in Anand, took help of her paramour Mukesh Parmar and her daughter Toral to dispose his body in a canal in Sultanpura village. According to the police, on March 30, Leela had a fight with her 45-year-old husband after he came home in a drunken state. In a moment of rage, she hit Manu on head with a wooden bat following which he died. A panicked Leela then called up her paramour Mukesh Parmar, a resident of Anand, who rushed to her home. They both decided to dispose of Manu’s body. Leela and Mukesh sat on their motorbike and kept Manu’s body between them. Manu drove the bike to Sultanpura village late in the night of March 30 and they disposed the body in the canal. Leela then came home and took help of her daughter Toral to clean up the blood stains on the floor and burn Manu’s slippers. When the cops recovered Manu’s body they began investigations and ascertained his identity on April 13. Investigators went through mobile call details of Leela and found unusually high number of calls between Leela and Mukesh on March 30 and March 31.

---||Kolkata||Arjun son’s ‘vision Bhatpara’ vs Trinamool’s vow to end violence||Bhatpara: Sporting white kurta-pajama, chappals and a saffron-green scarf around his neck, 33-year-old Pawan Kumar Singh — Bhatpara MLA, better known as MP Arjun Singh’s son — walked along the dingy lanes of the town and tried to come out of his father’s shadow as he spoke about his vision of “new Bhatpara”, the constituency that goes to polls on Thursday. “I feel there has been no development in Bhatpara over the years. Development doesn’t mean roads, lights and water. I believe real development happens with better educational infrastructure, hospitals and employment generation. For this, we need Centre’s help and that is the reason we need a BJP government here. That is my vision for new Bhatpara,” said Singh during his poll campaign at Arya Samaj Road on Sunday. Pawan’s father Arjun Singh had been a Bhatpara MLA for four terms since 2001 on a TMC ticket and his grandfather Satyanarayan Singh was a Congress MLA for three terms in this assembly segment. Bhatpara has been a fief for Singh’s family. Arjun Singh bolstered the family’s control in the area as he served as an MLA for four terms between 2001 and 2019 till he defected to BJP from Trinamool and became an MP. The same year, his son Pawan won the bypolls and became the MLA on a BJP ticket defeating TMC’s Madan Mitra. Most of the 20-odd jute mills in the Barrackpore industrial belt are in Bhatpara and these form the backbone of the local employment generation. But after serving as labourers at jute mills for generations, the workers now strive for better jobs and better amenities. “I have three daughters, one of whom is in school and two others are graduates. Both of them want to work but there are no jobs,” said Om Prakash Ram, who works at Jagaddal Jute Mill. Bhatpara has been on boil since the 2019 LS polls when Arjun Singh defected to BJP after being denied an MP ticket. TMC wants to make up for the lost ground by highlighting the strongman status and array of criminal cases lodged against both Arjun and Pawan Singh. It has floated a campaign asking voters to vote for “decent person” while putting forward local TMC warhorse Jitendra Shaw. “People here are tired of violence inflicted by Singh family. I am sure people will make the right choice,” said Shaw.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/arjun-sons-vision-bhatpara-vs-trinamools-vow-to-end-violence/articleshow/82150501.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Rane said that although he has spoken to several experts and epidemiologists around the world, nobody has a clue as to when the curve will be flattened. “Nobody seems to know,” Rane said, urging people to take precautions, and do the basics of wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. “The government is doing its best to provide quality healthcare and save lives, but people must also act responsibly. Please donate plasma and help us save lives,” he said. The requirement for plasma has gone up consequent to the rise in infections, but the response to plasma donation drive has hit rock bottom. Rane said that the combination of Remdesivir and plasma helped bring down mortalities during the first wave, and appealed to people to come forward to donate plasma. Rane also said that the requirement of oxygen cylinders will double over the next few days. The government has tapped various sources to bridge the gap between demand and supply. The oxygen requirement at GMC, which was 8-10 trolleys a day, has gone up to 45 trolleys a day, while the South Goa district hospital’s need has increased to 18 trolleys a day. “It will soon go up to 25 trolleys a day for the South Goa district hospital,” he said. He said the state required around 5,000-6,000 vials of Remdesivir a month. “GMC’s central pharmacy has 660 vials of Remdesivir after distribution to the South Goa district hospital,” said dean Dr S M Bandekar. “We will receive 4,000 more vials from Cipla on Tuesday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-records-17-deaths-in-a-day-highest-since-outbreak-of-pandemic/articleshow/82152655.cms||Bindiya Chari

Private hospitals here can’t shy away from their responsibility. In the entire country, private hospitals are playing a role to combat the crisis.” Rane, speaking to reporters after back-to-back meetings with health officials, said that the government won’t tolerate it if private hospital managements hand over (only) structures and disappear. “We don’t have the manpower to provide them,” he said. Currently, four corporate hospitals in the state have 75 beds among them reserved for Covid patients. All of these have been taken, and there’s now a waitlist due to the huge surge in cases. The four hospitals came on board quite late during the first phase of the pandemic, and a month after the public health department issued an order asking them (private hospitals) to free beds for Covid patients. After several rounds of discussions and deliberations, the government last year agreed to leave smaller hospitals, including those that advertised themselves as offering multi-specialties, and had the four corporate hospitals reserve some beds for Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pvt-hosps-must-keep-40-beds-for-covid-patients-rane/articleshow/82152658.cms||---

In phase-I, 30 beds are available with facility for oxygen cylinders, medicines and dedicated paramedical staff. EDMC mayor Nirmal Jain said that the facility became fully occupied as soon as the ward was made operational and figures were updated in the Delhi government website. “We are making best of efforts to contribute in this pandemic. EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand and additional commissioner Alka Sharma also visited the hospital to take stock of the situation. The 30 bedded-facility has been developed inside the emergency ward, which was converted into Covid unit.” The civic body is targeting to add 50 more beds by April 21 and later extending the facility up to 100 beds depending upon the feedback and operation this month. “Two wards in the hospital are currently lying vacant and preparation has started to convert them into Covid units. We have all medical assistance available here and in case of emergency or requirement for an ICU facility, we will refer the patient to the linked hospitals — GTB and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality,” said the mayor. Meanwhile, the corporation has decided to suspend certain OPDs and surgeries at hospitals to create more space for Covid patients. “To take bodies from GTB hospital to crematoriums, EDMC has also dedicated three ambulances free of cost,” said Nirmal Jain. Meanwhile, the opening of Covid care facility at Tilak Nagar Super Speciality Hospital was postponed to Tuesday, due to delay in supply of oxygen cylinders. It is planned to be 60-bed facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-starts-covid-ward-in-its-hospital/articleshow/82151655.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||India||BJP: No more ‘big’ rallies in West Bengal||NEW DELHI: No more than 500 people each will be allowed into PM Narendra Modi and other BJP campaigners’ remaining poll rallies in Bengal, party president JP Nadda decided on Monday amid the Covid surge. Modi will now visit Bengal on Friday, April 23, and address four rallies in Malda, Murshidabad, Birbhum and south Kolkata. The original plan was to have these four rallies spread over two days –– on April 21 and April 24. BJP functionaries said that all rallies would follow Covid-prevention guidelines. “We will try to arrange 100% seating arrangement for people at the PM’s rallies. I had proposed this during the PM’s Siliguri rally but security forces did not allow us to do this. They argued that there might be commotion if people came in large numbers,” BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu said. Trinamool Congress chief and Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has already announced she will not hold any big rallies in Kolkata, except for one meeting in north Kolkata next Monday. Mamata has also said she will hold fewer rallies in the districts. Congress's Rahul Gandhi, too, has suspended his planned rallies in Bengal. Congress’s alliance partner, the Left Front, was the first to cancel its rallies because of the Covid spike. BJP confirmed there would not be any roadshow as compliance of Covid norms might not be possible. It plans to telecast the rallies to ensure these are watched by as many people as possible. The campaign schedule of other BJP functionaries, including Union home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh and BJP national president JP Nadda, remain more or less unchanged.

In a letter to the CM, association president Narendor Rao Madhavaram said 61 employees working in BRKR Bhavan had tested positive in the last few days alone. Even chief secretary Somesh Kumar had tested positive earlier. Narendor Rao said space in the secretariat in BRKR Bhavan is congested and this is leading to an increase in the number of Covid-19 positive cases. The chambers and halls in the old secretariat building which were demolished were spacious. The association office-bearers also requested the CM to sanction 15 days special casual leave for employees testing positive and to increase the ceiling limit from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 3 lakh for reimbursement of medical expenses for employees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/allow-50-staff-in-sectt-employees/articleshow/82151658.cms||---
---||Delhi||Hindu Rao turned into Covid facility, but lack of preparedness haunts again||New Delhi: Hindu Rao Hospital has been converted into a Covid facility but it still lacks a large number of resources. North Delhi Municipal Corporation has sent a list of required resources, including drugs like Remdesivir, PPE kits and N-95 masks, to the Delhi government. Unlike last year, the healthcare workers will be staying in guesthouses this time. The corporation had failed to clear its dues towards hotels during the previous stint of Hindu Rao as a Covid hospital between July and October. North corporation mayor Jai Prakash claimed: “We have sent a list of required resources to the Delhi government. They had assured us earlier that all resources would be provided, but we have received no help so far.” The civic body has outlined its needs in the form of 200 Remdesivir injections, 2,000 PPE kits and 20,000 N-95 masks besides other necessary equipment. The 200-bed facility has so far admitted more than 125 patients. The cash-strapped civic body also requires 20,000 nitrile gloves, 10,000 examination gloves and 5,000 face shields for the operations at the hospital. The corporation has also outlined manpower and office support requirements in the form of 50 home guards and eight data entry operators. The list of required equipment includes 50 thermal scanners, 10 multipara operators and 100 oxygen cylinders with humidifiers. A control unit is also proposed to be set up with five computer systems. “A 200-bed Covid hospital has been started, while the number of Covid-designated beds will be increased to 350 and 10 ICU/CCU beds by next Sunday,” an order issued by the health department states. The largest municipal hospital had witnessed some hiccups during its last stint as Covid-designated hospital in 2020. Between June 27 and October 13, 2020, Hindu Rao admitted 186 patients, out of which 129 patients recovered and 28 patients passed away during treatment. The hospital also recorded several patients leaving their treatment midway. During the last phase of operations as Covid facility, a total of 208 doctors, 179 nurses, 67 paramedical staff and 193 ward boys and staffers were deployed in eight batches. Towards the end of Covid operations in October, doctors threatened to go on strike due to non-payment of salaries due to which 20 Covid patients had to be shifted to other hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hindu-rao-turned-into-covid-facility-but-lack-of-preparedness-haunts-again/articleshow/82151677.cms||Paras Singh
---||Lucknow||UP: 30,000 Remdesivir vials bought, 2.75 lakh vial shipment on way||LUCKNOW: Amid a scramble for Remdesivir injections in the state over past few days, the government said, 20,000-30,000 vials of the medicine were procured on Monday and another consignment of 2.75 lakh vials was expected in the next three days. A government spokesperson said, the vials were being distributed as per requirement to each district. “The government has placed orders with various pharmaceutical companies, including Cadila and Cipla for 1 lakh vials each, Mylan for 50,000 and Jubilant for 25,000 vials. On directions of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, additional chief secretary (MSME) Navneet Sehgal is directly in touch with these pharma firms,” he said. On Monday, the CM said, the number of beds should be increased in districts, which have a high case load, including Lucknow, Kanpur, Prayagraj, Varanasi, Jhansi, Gorakhpur and Meerut. Beds should also be raised in other districts, where cases are high. The government also appointed 106 doctors, selected through UP Public Service Commission, in hospitals to meet the growing demand for doctors and paramedics. “There are currently 255 Covid beds in Balrampur Hospital. This will be increased to 700 beds in coming days,” said the spokesperson. For people in home isolation, medical kits for at least a week should be provided to them in one go. Call centres should stay in touch with all patients and call them at least once a day. Half of 108 ambulance fleet should be reserved for Covid patients. Currently, 2.15 lakh tests are being done in the state. The CM said, the testing capacity should be expanded as it’s an important weapon against Covid-19. Arrangements should be made for rapid antigen testing at airport, railway and bus stations. The CM also directed authorities to strengthen the integrated command and control centres, saying these have an important role in Covid management in the state. There should be one ICCC in each district and it should be tasked with sharing information on bed availability and arranging for ambulances. The CM also directed senior officials to visit ICCCs at Lucknow, Kanpur and Prayagraj, three districts with the highest number of active cases and review their working.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/30k-remdesivir-vials-bought-2-75l-vial-shipment-on-way/articleshow/82152664.cms||---

However, the order issued by state chief secretary Om Prakash added that the curbs will not apply to the ongoing Kumbh Mela in Haridwar. The state has reported a sudden spike in novel coronavirus cases in the last one week. On Monday, 2,160 fresh cases of Covid-19 were reported in the state with 24 fatalities in the past 24 hours. During a meeting with senior officials on Sunday, chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat directed to limit the number of wedding guests from 200 to 100 and increase the fine on those found without face masks from Rs 100 to Rs 200. Meanwhile, the proposed weekend curfew on April 24 and 25 in Dehradun is posing a challenge for the people who have weddings scheduled on the same dates. In fact, hundreds of marriages have been planned in Dehradun and Haridwar on April 25, considered an auspicious day for nuptials. Due to daily night and weekend curfews in the capital city, the families who have planned the weddings are now in a state of confusion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/state-govt-limits-gatherings-to-100-instead-of-200-earlier/articleshow/82149661.cms||Gaurav Talwar

He said young people need to stop partying and parents must ensure the youth stay home. “I have seen that many restaurants are crowded,” Rane said. “Parties are happening on weekends in Morjim and elsewhere. It is a free for all. There should be restrictions on big gatherings, and swimming pools should be closed.” He added that tough measures need to be in place for at least a month. Rane told reporters that a 50% restriction should be implemented at restaurants and gyms to ensure social distancing. He also said that young people must understand the gravity of the situation. “People are seen dancing in clubs without masks. Action has to be taken against such clubs,” he said. He said he was speaking “passionately” because the health infrastructure has been over overburdened over the past few day. He also said the infectivity rate of the virus in the present phase of the pandemic has been very high. The infections, he said, have been spreading faster with people not complying with Covid measures. “Some people move about even after testing positive,” he said. However, replying to a question, he said that he was not in favour of imposing lockdowns. The state’s coastal belts have been abuzz with parties on a regular basis since October-November 2020, and no sooner were lockdown measures eased, organisers regularly flouted Covid protocols, but the state administration hasn’t initiated action against any club or hotel so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/situation-scary-need-tough-measures-rane/articleshow/82152666.cms||---
---||Dehradun||‘Over 18000 active Covid-19 cases in Uttarakhand’||DEHRADUN: Secretary in-charge of the health department Pankaj Pandey said on Monday that all arrangements were in place to tackle the second wave of Covid-19. “In the last 24 hours, 2,160 patients tested positive for Covid-19 in Uttarakhand. There are a total of 18,864 active cases at this point. Around 13,500 patients are in home isolation and around 5,000 in hospitals. We still have over 7,000 isolation beds, more than 2,500 oxygen supporter beds, 363 ICU beds and 463 ventilators to spare,” Pandey said, adding that 1.9 lakh healthcare workers have been vaccinated in the state so far, including 1.7 lakh front-line workers. A total of 15.9 lakh people have been vaccinated in the state so far, he further said. He claimed that there is no shortage of Remdesivir injections or vaccines. “Currently we have close to 3 lakh vaccines in stock. Also there is no shortage of oxygen, thanks to adequate production in three oxygen manufacturing plants here in Uttarakhand. In six months, eight oxygen generator plants have been set up in the state,” he added. Meanwhile, sources said that supply of Remdesivir from manufacturers is intermittent and not sufficient. Along with Remdesivir, plasma has also become hard to find. It is retrieved from the blood of cured Covid-19 patients and administered to affected persons, but authorities say hardly any recovered patients are willing to donate it. Families of patients who are making rounds of retail pharmacy stores in the district for Remdesivir, say it is next to impossible to find. Animesh Jain, whose wife has tested positive for the virus, was turned away by pharmacies on Saturday and Sunday. On Monday afternoon, he was told by a medical store owner on Rajpur Road that the last vial of Remdesivir had been sold just a few minutes ago. Vineet Rawat, whose aunt is in home isolation and has been prescribed Remdesivir, said he was yet to find it. Drug controller Tajber Singh told TOI that the state was getting very limited stock of Remdesivir from manufacturers in Ghaziabad. “I won’t say that the availability of Remdesivir in Uttarakhand is zero but it is certainly insufficient to cope with the current demand. We are getting the delivery in phases and in limited quantity. On Monday, 380 vials of Remdesivir were issued to Government Doon Medical College (GDMC) and 150 vials to city-based retailers. We have also sent Remdesivir stocks to Haridwar,” said Singh. He added that raids are being conducted at medical stores to curb overcharging on Remdesivir. Meanwhile, authorities at the Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) blood bank said that only four people have donated plasma since the second wave started. At GDMC, over 10 requests are placed for plasma every day now, with not a single donor volunteering so far at the hospital. “We have been receiving at least 10 requests of plasma every single day but of the 4,000 people we have treated in the past few months, not a single person agreed to donate plasma. Most complain of weakness and inability to donate blood,” said PRO, Doon Hospital, Sandeep Rana. Meanwhile, Manglaur MLA Qazi Nizamuddin has accused the BJP-led state government of neglecting his constituency in regards with ensuring supplies for proper treatment of Covid-19 patients. He said that although 14 ventilators were supplied to the Roorkee civil hospital in June 2020, they are still lying unused. “The government treats Manglaur as some 'outsider' territory,” added the legislator. Meanwhile, Dr Sanjay Kansal, chief medical superintendent of Roorkee civil hospital, has said that the ventilators will be ready-to-use by the end of this month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/over-18k-active-covid-19-cases-in-ukhand/articleshow/82149657.cms||Ishita Mishra

The district health department will depute its staff and doctors for the treatment of Covid patients here. This addition has increased the bed count for Covid patients at the BGH to 340 from the existing 167. The facility has been made functional from Monday, sources said. The decision was taken in the wake of rising number of Covid-19 cases. At present, 128 Covid patients are under treatment at the BGH. Sources said that the administration asked the BGH to increase the number of beds but the latter was already short-staffed to handle the existing patients. Thereafter, it was decided that the BGH will provide space and resources to set up 170 beds, while the health department will chip in with manpower. Civil surgeon Dr A K Pathak said, “We will utilise the bed facilities and infrastructure of BGH and depute our own doctors, nurses and other staff for the treatment of corona patients.

---||Ranchi||Trade bodies seek lockdown, ask shops to shut today in E S’bhum||Jamshedpur: Several trade bodies in East Singhbhum have demanded the state government to declare a lockdown for a short period of time to break the transmission chain. Bharat Vasani, who is the vice-president of Singhbhum Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said, “The second wave of the pandemic is spreading like wildfire and it is lethal. The government should take effective measures to contain the virus spread and traders will back the authorities if they decide to go for a week-long lockdown.” Vasani appealed to the traders and businessmen here to keep their establishments shut on Tuesday as a symbolic gesture. “I would request the traders to voluntarily shut their shops for a day to press the government to declare a lockdown,” he said. The national secretary of Confederation of All India Traders, Suresh Sonthalia, said, “Although any trader would oppose the idea of a shutdown under normal circumstances, the current situation is alarming as Covid-19 cases are rising exponentially and the shopkeepers believe that only a lockdown can help flatten the Covid curve.” He cited the examples of states like Maharashtra and others that have declared a partial lockdown and urged the government to take a decision in this regard as soon as possible. Taking a cue from Vasani, the president of Jamshedpur Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mohanlal Agarwal, asked the traders to voluntarily shut their shops for around 10 days, instead of just 24 hours, if the government doesn’t declare a lockdown. “Shutting down for just a day is not enough. A week-long closure is required at least – like the traders in Ranchi have done - to break the transmission chain,” Agarwal said. On Sunday, traders in Ranchi’s Shastri Market announced to go for a week-long lockdown to protect themselves, their family members and their staff from getting infected. “Traders in Jamshedpur should follow suit and not wait for the government’s approval,” Agarwal said. Sakchi Merchants’ Association’s president Anil Chaudhary said the deadly second wave of coronavirus needs to be contained at every cost and they will stand by the government if it decides to go for economic and other types of restrictions to bring down the caseload. All the trade bodies’ representatives, however, said that essential services should be not under any restrictions. Traders, on the other hand, are in a sort of a Catch-22 situation. On one hand, they are reluctant to go for a lockdown because of the resultant loss of revenue but on the other, they know that the current Covid situation necessitates some sort of restrictions, without which they stand the chance of getting infected. A 36-year-old confectionery store owner in Kadma market said, “Whether we go for a voluntary lockdown or the state declares it, it means a loss of revenue. But if we keep our shops open, it poses a risk to our lives.” In the past week, East Singhbhum reported 3,570 cases and 57 deaths. As of Monday morning, the district recorded 24,399 infections, 20,097 recoveries, 447 deaths and 3,855 active cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/trade-bodies-seek-lockdown-ask-shops-to-shut-today-in-e-sbhum/articleshow/82150553.cms||B Sridhar
---||Ranchi||Janta Locks Down, Cong Split On Curbs Call||Ranchi: The top leadership of the state Congress is reportedly undecided over the issue of enforcing a lockdown, even as business entities across several districts have started announcing self-imposed lockdown. After shops in Ranchi and Pakur decided to shut down business for a week to break the chain of Covid-19 transmissions, similar decisions were taken by their counterparts in Ramgarh and Lohardaga, among other places, on Monday. The Jharkhand Bar Association also went into lockdown mode from Monday for the next seven days. The JMM, the leading constituent of the mahagathbandhan government, had already called for a complete lockdown during an online meeting headed by chief minister Hemant Soren on Saturday. But the cracks within the grand old party is seemingly evident as some of its MLAs and senior party workers are openly urging the chief minister to announce a lockdown, whereas state Congress president and finance minister Rameshwar Oraon has opposed the proposal citing possible impact on livelihoods. On Monday, Congress’s Mahagama MLA Deepika Pandey appealed to the CM for a 15-day lockdown. “It is high time that we had a full lockdown. Traders, judiciary and common people from different sections are going for self-imposed lockdown. The way people are dying in Ranchi and in other parts of the state in the wake of growing cases, the chief minister must call for a 15-day lockdown,” Pandey said. “We must accept the shortcomings that we have to tackle the growing surge. As a senior member of my party, I want the CM to announce a lockdown to break the chain of infection,” Congress’s co-working president Rajesh Thakur said. Oraon, on the other hand, said that lockdown wasn’t successful during the first wave. “Lockdown is a bane for the poor and the underprivileged. We have to balance lives and livelihoods,” Oraon said, adding that even the AICC high command was opposed to the proposal of enforcing a lockdown. State leaders, however, questioned Oraon’s logic. “If Sonia-ji and Rahul-ji are opposed to lockdown, then why did the Maharashtra and the Rajasthan governments announce lockdown in their respective states. The Congress is in power in those two states as well,” said a Congress MLA requesting anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/janta-locks-down-cong-split-on-curbs-call/articleshow/82150560.cms||ASRP Mukesh

The lawmaker in a letter to the Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan said that the unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases in the state has made the situation alarming and the demand for Remdesivir injection has increased manifold as more and more patients are getting admitted with severe complications. “The unavailability of Remdesivir injection is proving to be a major stumbling block in the treatment of severely infected persons and the Centre should ramp up supply of the injection to the state,” he wrote. The MP in a separate letter to Jharkhand health minister Banna Gupta also sought the latter’s intervention in making Remdesivir and Tocilizumab 400 injection available in ample amounts at the Covid care centres in Dhanbad. Expressing his concern over the inordinate delay in getting test reports, the MP also requested the health minister to increase the number of RT-PCR testing centres in Dhanbad. The SNMMCH is the only institute in the district that is conducting RT-PCR tests. Meanwhile, Dhanbad MLA Raj Sinha tested positive on Sunday evening. In a social media message, he has requested everyone meeting him in the last few days to get themselves tested. Chandankiyari MLA and former minister Amar Bauri has also tested positive. Earlier, Sindri MLA Indrajeet Mahto was airlifted to Hyderabad after being diagnosed with Covid-induced lung infection. Till Monday afternoon, the district recorded 9,530 Covid-19 cases, of which 996 were active.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-dhanbad-mp-seeks-remdesivir-from-centre/articleshow/82150803.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Speaking to reporters after am executive committee-level meeting at its headquarters in Main Road, FJCCI president Pravin Kumar Jain (Chabra) said: “As per the health experts and doctors who are at the frontline, a lockdown is the only way to slow down the rate of transmission in Jharkhand. The current situation is very alarming and we appeal to all the businessmen and entrepreneurs to voluntarily close their establishments from the afternoon of April 21 till April 25.” FJCCI’s public appeal comes a day after traders in Ranchi’s Shastri Market closed their shops till April 25 over fears of them, their family members and their staff getting infected. After 115 shops in Shastri Market downed shutters, several business establishments in the city’s Lalji Hirjee Road closed indefinitely from 1 pm on Monday. They had initially decided to shut shops only till April 25 but they changed it after witnessing the surge in cases. “The decision was taken collectively by the traders and citizens of the area. The scarcity of Covid-19 beds and oxygen in the city points towards the fact that a lockdown is the only way out,” Deepak Kumar Maroo, former FJCCI president, said. FJCCI also appealed to the housing societies to stock up on oxygen concentrator machines for emergency use if they have any Covid patients in home isolation. The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) are a worried lot over the growing Covid-19 cases statewide. Already hit by months of closure due to the nationwide lockdown last year, MSMEs are staring at a complete breakdown if a lockdown is imposed. “There are several fixed expenses such as power, labour, interests, which can be met only if the factories are running. But we fear for the lives of ourselves and our staff. The challenge is to strike a balance between both,” Philip Mathew, the president of Jharkhand Small Industries Association (JSIA), told TOI. On April 17, the JSIA sent out a public appeal to all its members and said while it was not possible to completely shut down their establishments, the entrepreneurs must focus on maximizing the work-from-home culture.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/fjcci-appeals-to-traders-to-close-shops-from-apr-21-25/articleshow/82150711.cms||Dhritiman Ray

---||Ranchi||Ranchi hospital refunds Rs 1.6 lakh to ‘cheated’ Covid patient||RANCHI: A day after images of an exorbitant bill slapped on a Covid patient in Ranchi went viral on social media, the private hospital where he was admitted refunded the entire sum of Rs 1.6 lakh charged to him after the intervention of health minister Banna Gupta and the Ranchi district administration on Monday. The relatives of Arvind Kumar Singh paid Rs 1.6 lakh to Dwarika Hospital and Research Centre on Sunday after he was admitted to the facility for less than three days. Of this amount, Rs 1 lakh was billed to him for just 19 hours stay at the hospital’s ICU. The incident came to light after JMM’s Jama MLA Sita Soren tweeted a copy of hospital bill. Chief minister Hemant Soren took cognizance of the issue and directed Gupta to get it investigated and take stringent action against any such ‘loot’. On the directions from Gupta, the Ranchi district administration contacted the patient’s family and a team led by Namkum CO was sent to conduct a probe on Monday. Talking to TOI, Ranchi SDM Utkarsh Gupta said: “The patient’s family said that they were charged exorbitantly by the hospital. As they did not want to file an FIR, the treatment charges were refunded to them.” When TOI contacted relatives of other Covid patients’ at the hospital, they too said charged way more than the government-approved limits. In another incident the same hospital slapped a bill of over Rs 3 lakh to a Covid-19 positive patient who was admitted on Saturday. “My brother was admitted to the hospital on Sunday morning with breathlessness and was on oxygen support. The hospital asked us to bring oxygen, which is required for seamless oxygen support as they did not had one. We provided them with that too. As we were not satisfied with the services, we decided to shift our patient and they charged us Rs 75,000 for a just six hours of oxygen-supported bed and other material,” said one. When asked what the administration would do about such complaints from the same hospital, the Ranchi SDM said: “We will probe all such matters and, if required, patients will be refunded. Having said that, I urge all private hospitals to adhere to the price capping done by state government and help us in our fight against the virus.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/city-hosp-refunds-rs-1-6l-to-cheated-cov-patient/articleshow/82150772.cms||Gaurav Pandey

Garhwa civil surgeon Dr Dinesh Kumar Singh said, “A departmental inquiry has been initiated and those found guilty will face action.” The patient, who was admitted to the hospital since April 14, was not on oxygen support till Sunday night, Dr Singh added. The deceased was identified as Niraj Upadhyay and he was a resident of Karkatta village under Meral police station limits. Hospital sources said Upadhyay was showing signs of depression soon after he was admitted. Following his dinner on Sunday around 9 pm, Upadhyay started pacing up and down the Covid ward, demanding oxygen supply. The next day, the hospital staff found him hanging from the front gate.

According to the police, Bhargav had approached the victim, who is also active on the short-video social media platforms, and proposed that she get into a relationship with him. The girl rejected him and broke off contact. At this point, the accused allegedly started blackmailing the complainant. Subsequently, the accused told the girl that he could get her opportunities in TV shows and took her to his home in Hyderabad where, police say, ‘he committed penetrative sexual assault against her making her pregnant’. Based on the minor victim’s complaint, Pendurthi police registered a case under sections 376, 354 (c) and section 6 of the POCSO Act on April 16. ACP G Prem Kajal of Disha women police station arrested the accused from Hyderabad and said that a charge-sheet will be filed within seven days .

---||Goa||Take Bold Steps To Contain The Virus||There is no gentler way to put it: Goa is staring at a disaster. With daily caseload nearing 1,000, highest positivity rate of 34% in the country and almost 30 deaths in just two days, the Goa government needs to get its act together, and fast. Chief minister Pramod Sawant’s constant refrain that the “government is monitoring the situation” is stale. So far, the government has been of committees, meetings and discussions, but without a plan of action. Goa remains one of the only states in India with no entry curbs or testing, and the time has come to put an end to that. With Maharashtra and Delhi under very strict curfew, many are heading to free-for-all Goa. In allowing uncontrolled tourism during arguably the worst medical crisis in Goa’s history, the government is abdicating its responsibility. It is the government’s monumental negligence that has led the tiniest state with high human development indicators, to this dreadful point. But shockingly, the government still doesn't seem to have grasped the seriousness of the situation, with the CM insisting on holding exams, proudly claiming that “casinos are following SOPs”, and turning a blind eye to the egregious violation of Covid-appropriate norms in nightclubs across the state. It is imperative that the government does everything in its power to avoid a lockdown or impose a curfew, as that is something the state’s fledgling economy can ill-afford. This starts with a strict enforcement of norms. The solution to this crisis cannot be to keep adding beds, because while infrastructure can be added, healthcare workers can’t be manufactured overnight. The superhuman efforts of Goa’s doctors and medical workers over the past year have kept things going, but like their colleagues around the world, they’re now stretched and stressed. The government needs to complement their efforts, not actively make their lives more difficult. As the Allahabad high court said: “We are of the definite view that if things are not arrested to give some respite to medical and paramedical staff, the entire system would collapse, and relief will be confined to VIPs and VVIPs.” Bold steps are a must before things get even worse, and if they aren’t coming, perhaps other organs of the state must step in, like how high courts in other states held governments accountable for their failure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/take-bold-steps-to-contain-the-virus/articleshow/82152696.cms||---
---||Chennai||Charge of temples: Tamil Nadu, citizens need to find a fine balance together||By: R S RaveendhrenCHENNAI: A section of people wants to free Hindu temples from government control. They want temples and their properties to be handed over to devotees to ensure better administration and management. These groups are also suggesting that the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) board under the Government of Tamil Nadu be disbanded. There are three major grounds on which attacks are being launched against the HR&CE department. Its competency is under question in the light of mismanagement of temples, theft of idols and lack of protection to temple properties. In January 2018, a response filed by the HR&CE department in the Madras high court stated that 1,204 sculptures belonging to 387 temples had been stolen since 1992. The laxity of the government in protecting the priceless idols, jewels, and sculptures of Hindu temples and its cavalier approach towards preservation of ancient heritage have sowed seeds of mistrust and shaken the confidence of the common man. To understand the issues of the present, we need to delve into the past, looking into why the state control came into place. Legend has it that in the 7th century, Nandanar (one of the 63 Nayanmars), was denied entry into temples for being an outcast and Lord Sivalokanathar (Shiva) at the Tirupungur temple commanded Nandi (the bull) to move away from the gate to unobstruct Nandanar’s view of the shrine. Discrimination while entering temples was a reality when the kings reigned, and the right to worship and access to temples remained elusive for a long time. Apart from this, there were complaints about mismanagement, misappropriation of temple funds, and failure to protect temple properties. Many believe that the British introduced the Madras Regulation VII of 1817, which brought temples under the control of the government as an agenda for colonisation and conversions. Temples in the south possessed massive land and wealth, with this regulation the British could monitor grants and endowments to them. In 1840, there was a directive to return temples to their trustees. This had something to do with Christian missionaries not liking the idea of managing Hindu temples. In 1922, the Hindu Paripalanam Act was proposed by Ramraya Ningar, the king of Panagal, when he took charge as the chief minister of the Madras Presidency. He attempted to bring temples under the control of the government. In 1927, the HR&CE board was constituted and vested with the power to control and supervise administration of temples. Fight against prejudicesTamil Nadu may be a land with rich spiritual and cultural values, yet the right to worship at temples were secured only after the state’s intervention. Following the success of the temple entry movement by Periyar, A Vaidhyanatha Iyer headed the Madurai Temple Entry Movement in 1939 to facilitate the entry of the oppressed classes into Madurai Meenakshi temple. This was the time when the Temple Entry Authorisation and Indemnity Act of 1939 by C Rajagopalachari (the then CM of Madras Presidency) and Temple Entry Authorisation Act, 1947 by Omandoor P Ramasami Reddiar (first CM of Tamil Nadu) were passed. The legislation reflected the intent of the government to democratise temple worship and give all people access. Present problemIn spite of damning allegations, the Tamil Nadu government chooses to stay silent on the issue. One of the campaigns against government control claims that the HR&CE Act, 1959 is ultra vires the Constitution and Hindu temples are selectively being subjected to state intervention. This is an attempt to mislead people. The Supreme Court had upheld the constitutional validity of the 1951 law which is its earlier version. Further, religious institutions and practices of Muslims, Christians and Sikhs are not immune to state intervention. It is a well-settled law that under Article 25 and Article 26 of the Constitution, the state has the right to regulate and manage the governance of temples. It must be noted that the HR&CE department serves not just as a custodian of Hindu temples but also as a progressive transformative tool for society, managing eduational institutions, social welfare organisations and hospitals. The questions to be asked are: Can citizens’ groups seek any redemption of sovereign functions in their favour citing inefficient administration? Does this not tantamount to challenging the authority of a democratic state? The state’s intervention had unchained Hindu temples from communal hegemony that was enjoyed by dominant castes and economically strong sections. The right to worship and access to Hindu temples remained a socio-communal privilege. It was never available equally to all citizens. Today claims against state control are being made by whipping up religious sentiments. It buries the historical necessity of the state’s intervention in the first place. Working together for the futureThe way forward is better accountability and efficiency on the part of the state. The provisions governing the eviction of encroachers and illegal occupants from temple land and properties should be amended by adopting a summary procedure. Present provisions do not come down heavily on squatters, which harms the interest of temples. Alienation of temple land and properties needs to be prohibited at the office of registration since the HR&CE department has completed the digitisation of land records of temples and mutts. The government can invite citizens’ groups to forge and facilitate a government-citizen partnership (GCP) to restore and rehabilitate temples. It can welcome the devotees to sponsor various activities without compromising on its sovereign functions. That could go a long way in balancing sentiments of devout citizens without compromising on the social responsibilities of the government.

---||India||No illegality in move on ED director, Centre tells apex court||NEW DELHI: The Centre told the Supreme Court on Monday that there was no illegality in its decision to modify the tenure of Enforcement Directorate chief Sanjay Kumar Mishra from two years to three years. Opposing a PIL filed by NGO ‘Common Cause’ against alleged retrospective change in the appointment of ED director, the government said in its affidavit that the central government was competent to amend the original appointment order by varying the term of two years with three years. “This power can be exercised in the like manner and subject to the same conditions which are otherwise applicable under Section 25 of the CVC Act,” the affidavit said. The Centre contended that the NGO’s PIL be dismissed as it was devoid of any merit. It said some organisations wanted to control the government and its institutions by filing PILs in court and urged that such petitions should not be entertained. The petitioner alleged that the ED director had already superannuated and the post being a “politically sensitive” one, the extension had curtailed the independence of the ED chief. Mishra, an Indian Revenue Service officer, was appointed ED director for two years in November 2018. In November last year, the appointment was modified “retrospectively” by the Centre and his term of two years was increased to three years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-illegality-in-move-on-ed-director-centre-tells-apex-court/articleshow/82154365.cms||---
---||Goa||‘CM responsible for rise in Covid’||Panaji: The state government needs to get its act together and begin testing all those who enter the state, Congress said on Monday. The party also said that the 300-bed super-speciality block at Bambolim needs to be used to treat Covid-19 patients. The party’s youth wing president, Varad Mardolkar, said that the figures for Covid-19 in Goa paint a very grim picture, which will only be made worse if the novel coronavirus makes deeper inroads to the hinterland. Mardolkar said that if the cases rise in Goa’s rural areas, the existing Covid facilities will not be enough to treat patients. “The only person responsible for the situation in Goa is the state government, which is not at all serious in controlling Covid. No restrictions have been imposed in Goa. There is no seriousness seen in the steps taken by the state government,” he said. Mardolkar also blamed the government for its failure to prepare for the second wave of the Covid pandemic. He claimed that Goa is running out of beds, ventilators, medicines, trained medical staff and even oxygen. “From November 2020, when Covid was in control, the government had time to learn and put things in place. They knew that the second wave was coming. Despite this, why weren’t they ready? Today it appears as if the chief minister Pramod Sawant and health minister Vishwajit Rane are blaming people,” Mardolkar said. Congress party’s youth wing also demanded that RT-PCR tests be conducted on all those entering the state. “Because a lockdown has been imposed in Delhi, many of them who have second homes in Goa are rushing here. In such a situation, when people of other states are coming to Goa, the government must make RT-PCR tests compulsory,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-responsible-for-rise-in-covid/articleshow/82152729.cms||---
---||Chennai||Getting up, close and personal with performing artists||Carnatic musician Savita Narasimhan has always been keen on documenting and archiving everything related to the performing arts of south India. And that’s the vision behind ‘Notes to myself’, a docu-series that delves into the lives, creative processes and choices of artists."Documentation and archiving needn’t be only of the past. It can be as things happen as I believe an artist’s entire career should be documented for their journey to be captured," says Savita, who founded MOPA (Museum of Performing Arts) Foundation in 2017. The first episode of ‘Notes To Myself’, the organisation’s flagship project, featuring Bharatanatyam exponent Leela Samson, will be uploaded on their YouTube channel on April 24."I wanted to archive music, dance and theatre of south India as I feel so much of it has been lost. And what has been preserved is not easily accessible to all," says Savita.MOPA’s first project was an exhibition to mark the centenary year of legendary Bharatanatyam dancer T Balasaraswati. "It was exhibited in five locations, including Bengaluru and Singapore," says Savita, whose other projects came to a standstill because of the pandemic.In January, MOPA launched its YouTube channel. "Though I want to establish a physical museum, it will take time. And the pandemic has pushed all museums to look at the digital platform, so I thought why not start archiving and presenting," says Savita.So MOPA compiled all the footage on Balasaraswati into smaller capsules and put it out every Saturday. "For me, an archive needs to be easily accessible and this is one way of doing it," says Savita, who then came up with the idea of a docu-series on living legends."There are so many great artists in this part of the world. We see them on stage but don’t know them. I wanted to give an insight into their thought processes, and life choices. What fascinates me is the human element and we have tried to highlight it in the series," says Savita, who began working on it in last December.The first season, featuring Leela Samson. Bombay Jayashri, T M Krishna and Pradeep Kumar has been shot by V Gowrishankar. "We have tried to match the personality to the location. For instance, we shot Leela Samson at a gazebo in Kingsley in Chetpet since she is a nature love. For Bombay Jayashri, we got a home that had a huge library as she wanted books around her," says Savita.Each artist has spoken about his/her work as well as important turning points in life. "Everyone knows Leela Samson moved from Kalakshetra to Delhi. But do you know she had already been cast as Sita in Rukmini Devi’s production and why she moved? The docu-series will tell you all that more," says Savita.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/getting-up-close-and-personal-with-performing-artists/articleshow/82154366.cms||Priya Menon
---||Goa||As 6 GMC residents test +ve, doctors ask for isolation accommodation||PANAJI: After six resident doctors at Goa Medical College (GMC) tested positive for Covid-19 during the second wave of the pandemic, the Goa Association of Resident Doctors (GARD) has asked health minister Vishwajit Rane and dean Dr S M Bandekar for a place where they can isolate. “They cannot be accommodated in the general GARD hostel,” said association president Dr Pratik Sawant. “We have requested the authorities and the government to identify a separate quarantine facility for doctors who test positive, which will be quite inevitable.” Five of the six doctors who contracted Covid were vaccinated, and all of them have mild symptoms of fever and myalgia, but still require a place to isolate. “Some have arranged their own accommodation at their friend’s or colleague’s residences for their quarantine, which is depressing,” Sawant said. “They still require a separate quarantine facility, which is not in place yet. We have got a positive response from the authorities.” Later, Rane said he would speak to the chief minister to arrange accommodation for doctors who test positive to isolate. “They need separate accommodation. This has to be done so that doctors have a sense of security that they’re taken care of. This has to be taken care of by the administration,” Rane told reporters. The association also requested the government for single-room accommodation facilities for doctors deputed on duty to the South Goa district hospital and ESI hospital. “At Colva Residency, doctors have to share accommodation,” Sawant said. “With a high risk of getting infected, it will be quite difficult to maintain social distancing in a twin-sharing accommodation, and might lead to more positivity among doctors. With so much being done to ensure all other things are in place, what happens if the pivot of the system, the doctors, fall short owing to infections?” Single-room accommodation facilities provided to doctors sent to South Goa, which were provided during the first wave, will help them do their duties diligently with higher safety, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-6-gmc-residents-test-ve-docs-ask-for-isolation-accommodation/articleshow/82152717.cms||---
