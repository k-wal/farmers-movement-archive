Daily deaths crossed 1,000 for the first time since October 2, with at least 1,035 fatalities recorded on Tuesday, with data from Assam yet to be received till late at night. New cases in the last 24 hours stood at 1,84,705, with Assam's count yet to be added. This was the eighth new all-time of daily cases reported in the last 10 days. During this period, the peak has risen from 1,03844 on April 4, registering a steep 78% increase. As many as seven states posted their highest-ever daily case count on Tuesday, led by Uttar Pradesh, which recorded 18,021 fresh infections in a single day. Chhattisgarh logged another fresh high with 15,121 new cases in the state and as many as 156 more deaths in a single day. The state has been registering the highest fatalities in the country after Maharashtra over the past eight days. Other states where the daily case count hit an all-time high were Delhi (13,468 new cases), Madhya Pradesh (8,998), Gujarat (6,690), Bengal (4,817) and Bihar (4,157). In at least nine more states, the day's case tally was the since December or earlier. These included Kerala, where infections surged to 7,515, the highest since October 31, Tamil Nadu (6,984 cases, the highest since July 27), Andhra Pradesh (4,228, highest since October 13), Jharkhand (2,844, August 31), Uttarakhand (1,925, September 19), Odisha (1,784, October 23), J&K (1,269, September 20), Tripura (62, November 21) and Meghalaya (87, December 13). Maharashtra recorded 60,212 fresh cases, the second highest daily count after 63,294 cases reported on Sunday. Cases in Mumbai fell below 8,000 (at 7,873) for the first time since March 13. The state continued to register the highest death toll in the country. But Tuesday's deaths, at 281, were lower than the toll recorded in recent days. Deaths from the virus were rising sharply across several states. After Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh reported the highest toll on Tuesday at 85, followed by Delhi (81), Karnataka and Gujarat (67 each), Punjab (53) and Madhya Pradesh (40).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-daily-cases-hit-new-peak-of-1-85-lakh/articleshow/82055251.cms||---
---||India||This Googal plagued by unwanted traffic||BEHROR (Rajasthan): Till a few months ago, hardly anyone would have noticed the curiously named Googal Kota village in Alwar district, a kilometre off the Delhi-Jaipur highway. But for four months now, cars going to Delhi from Jaipur have been taking a diversion through the village after the highway was blocked mid-December last year by protesting farmers of Rajasthan. This unwanted entry of traffic into their village has left the 3,000-odd villagers furious. Farmer Bhoop Singh, 65, former Googal Kota head, grumbled about the destruction of the village road by the thousands of trucks and cars passing through the hamlet lanes. “With great effort, we laid brick roads in 2007 that we later upgraded to concrete in 2017,” Singh said, pointing to the pools of waste water collected in the enormous potholes created by the heavy traffic. The steady stream of vehicles has damaged the village drains too. 70-year-old Umrawali Devi, having spent all her adult life in the village, had never seen living conditions deteriorate in this fashion. “We are worried about our grandchildren, who are not safe playing outside now,” she said. “By god’s grace, no accident has occurred yet. But it is a matter of time. It is worse at night when trucks move in even bigger numbers.” There are around 500 houses in this Rajput-dominated village and residents say that both children and their livestock are at risk of being hit by cars. Suman Devi, who was recently elected to the panchayat, said that the potholes have become so deep over the last three months that vehicles also break down because of them. “Heavy cranes are often called in to move the stalled vehicles, but the traffic is held up all through the process,” Devi said. “Most Googal Kota residents are poor farmers who augment their earning by rearing livestock, but you can’t even ensure their safety in such an environment.” Vikram Singh Chauhan, the village security guard, claimed the degradation has taken place in the last couple of months. “The drains have broken and the waste water now flows into the pits on the roads. Some stretches are so bad that people are forced to actually step into the filthy water to get past,” said Chauhan. However, while appearing palpably fed up by the inconveniences introduced into their lives, the villagers express sympathy for the cause of the agitating farmers. Googal Kota village is located in Behror tehsil of Alwar district in Rajasthan, around 70km from the district headquarter, Alwar. Villagers claimed that the village has been around for close to 300 years and has always remained, like it does today, on the borders areas of small kingdoms and states Shyam Sundar Yadav, sarpanch of the village, said, “Now people associate Googal Kota more with the internet’s Google, but the village has a rich 200-300-year history and was variously inhabited by Gujjars, Yadavs and Rajputs in differing eras. Of course, people from all communities live here. Kota comes from the word kot, which translates to a fort.” Yadav also admitted that the situation had deteriorated a lot, but claimed that restoration work would begin soon. “Travellers will have to find some way to reach their destinations. From Tuesday, we will block the roads where the work on laying the sewer line will start soon,” he asserted. “Once the sewer line work is completed, we will move a proposal for a new road.” The farmers’ protest has blocked several highways in the National Capital Region NCR, and motorists now pass through the hinterland villages. They may be seeing how people in places like Googal Kota live, but the only consolation for the harried villagers is that this is giving their civic problems bigger visibility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/this-googal-plagued-by-unwanted-traffic/articleshow/82055726.cms||Paras Singh

He was later hospitalized for a bullet injury. A BSF spokesperson said that security personnel observed suspicious movement of the Pakistani national near border post number 942 as the man was making desperate attempts to cross the fence. “The intruder was warned to stop but he did not pay attention. He was subsequently fired upon, due to which he got a minor injury,” the spokesperson said. BSF troops later apprehended him and handed him over to the police and was hospitalized. During preliminary questioning, the intruder disclosed his identity as Shabbir (40). Earlier on March 21, BSF troops had apprehended a Pak intruder along the international border in Jammu’s Ramgarh sector. Another intruder was killed by BSF troops in Samba sector at a forward post in Ramgarh on March 16. Prior to this, on February 8, BSF troops had shot dead a Pakistani intruder along the international border in Samba sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pakistan-intruder-caught-along-international-border-in-jammu/articleshow/82056342.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||India||Protests continue across Pak against arrest of far-right TLP chief||ISLAMABAD: Protests continued for the second day on Tuesday in several cities across Pakistan following the arrest of the chief of Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), a far-right religious party known for holding mass demonstrations over blasphemy-related issues. Hundreds of TLP supporters were taken into custody on Monday night after demonstrations against the arrest of Saad Hussain Rizvi turned violent, leaving several policemen and civilians injured and at least two people dead. The young Rizvi had succeeded his father Khadim Hussain Rizvi as head of TLP after the latter’s death in November last year. On Monday afternoon, police in the eastern city of Lahore took Rizvi into custody, a day after he had issued a video message to his supporters, directing them to be ready for a long march on April 20 if the government failed to implement an agreement it had inked with TLP in February. His arrest has been seen as an attempt to prevent him from leading the long march against the government. As news of Rizvi’s arrest spread, TLP issued a call for nationwide protests, with its workers blocking main thoroughfares in all major cities, including Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi, Peshawar and Gujranwala. They blocked highways, motorways, metro-bus services routes and train tracks, resulting in massive traffic jams. Police personnel, who tried to disperse the crowds, met with violence and, in some cities, they resorted to tear-gas shelling and aerial firing in a bid to restore peace. According to a statement issued by the National Highways and Motorways Police, over 50 points on the highways were blocked by TLP workers. In November, the TLP had called off a sit-in protest that had blocked a major highway linking the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi over the issue of remarks made by French President Emmanuel Macron that had been considered Islamophobic. At the time, the government had signed a deal with the party wherein it promised to consider evicting the French ambassador, banning all French goods from Pakistan and guaranteeing an amnesty to all TLP protesters arrested during those demonstrations. In February this year, the government had signed a new agreement after TLP threatened fresh protests to implement the previous agreement. Under the February agreement, the government had agreed not to arrest any TLP workers and place before Parliament a resolution to expel the French ambassador from Pakistan. The deadline for the government to meet these demands was April 20. Founded by firebrand cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi, TLP has agitated for several years over the issue of perceived blasphemy, holding mass demonstrations across the country, calling for all “blasphemers” to be killed. The party rose to further prominence after the country’s 2018 general election, when it secured the fourth-highest share of the popular vote for parliamentary seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/protests-continue-across-pak-against-arrest-of-far-right-tlp-chief/articleshow/82056371.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

USCIS has announced that F-1 visa holders (students enrolled in a degree course) can apply for the optional practical training (OPT) sanction online. In other words, Form I-765 can be e-filed. As per the last Open Doors Survey, 81,173 students from India had enrolled in the OPT program. It enables international students to work for a year post completion of their studies. Students from the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) field get a further extension of two years. “USCIS remains committed to maximizing our online filing capabilities,” said acting USCIS director Tracy Renaud. If an applicant submits Form I-765 online to request employment authorization on or after April 15, but is eligible for a different employment authorization category, USCIS will deny the application and retain the fee, the immigration agency has explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/intl-students-can-file-opt-forms-online-says-uscis/articleshow/82056458.cms||Lubna Kably

According to the Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad, the presiding body of all akhadas, about one lakh seers were at the religious congregation on Monday for the Shahi Snan. Haridwar CMO Dr SK Jha, however, said Covid-19 rules were flouted despite attempts to enforce the government guidelines. In the last 24 hours, he added, five seers from Juna Akhada, two from Niranjani Akhada, and one each from Nath and Agni akhadas have tested positive. “So far, 18 seers have been infected (in four days), including president of ABAP and head of Niranjani Akhada Narendra Giri,” the CMO added. Giri had to be moved to AIIMS Rishikesh after his health deteriorated.

---||World||Lawsuit filed challenging processing delays of documents for H-4 and L-2 non-immigrant spouses||WASHINGTON DC: Last night, the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) and Wasden Banias, LLP filed a class action lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) challenging the extraordinary processing delays on extensions of status and extensions of employment authorization documents (EAD) for H-4 and L-2 non-immigrant spouses. According to Jennifer Minear, President of AILA, “The delays that H-4 and L-2 nonimmigrants are facing needlessly place families in financial limbo. DHS has the legal tools and authority to grant work authorization to impacted individuals whose financial security is hanging in the balance, and it should immediately begin to use those tools to provide solutions. DHS can and must revoke the unnecessary biometrics requirements for H-4 and L-2 nonimmigrants, provide automatic work authorization while DHS processes EAD renewal requests, and allow EAD applicants to file their renewal applications sooner than 180 days prior to EAD expiration to prevent gaps in work authorization.” Jesse Bless, AILA’s Director of Federal Litigation, added, “In 2019, the Trump administration implemented a new biometrics requirement for H-4 and L-2 and other dependents seeking to extend their stay in the US. These new requirements added to the already extraordinary processing delays—delays that COVID-19 restrictions further exacerbated. The process to attain work authorization should not put families at risk of immense loss of income and instability. There are reasonable and immediate steps that DHS can take to make certain that visa holders meet requirements without imposing needless suffering. We hope to work with the government on immediate solutions to get these individuals back working.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/lawsuit-filed-challenging-processing-delays-of-documents-for-h-4-and-l-2-non-immigrant-spouses/articleshow/82056747.cms||Lubna Kably

Banking and metal stocks led the rally while IT sector witnessed profit taking. The day’s rally recouped a little over 30% of Monday’s loss of 1,708 points. In the process the market also discounted the more than expected rise in retail inflation in March to 5.5% and the sharp 3.6% drop in February IIP number. According to Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, spite the day’s gains in the short run it’s the impact of the lockdown at various parts of the country due to rising Covid-19 infections will determine the market’s trend. “How the lockdowns will affect the economy will determine the trend of the domestic market in the short-term,” Nair said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-rises-661-pts-on-govt-nod-to-more-vaccines/articleshow/82056824.cms||---
---||India||Army, people power cell service in village on Pangong shore||LEH: After years of waiting for telecom connectivity, residents of Merak, a forward village opposite Finger 3 area on the south bank of Pangong lake in Ladakh, hit upon a novel formula to make their dream come true. In an unusual example of collaboration, the Army agreed to allot capacity in a 25-km optical fibre cable link to Chushul for civilian traffic, state-run telecom service provider BSNL set up the equipment, villagers provided the labour and money for a solar-storage power plant came from councillor Konchok Stanzin’s constituency development fund. The village finally made it to the country’s telecom map on March 1 and has 24x7 service. “The model was applied to launch telecom service in Lukung in 2017 and Kargyam. I am trying to replicate it to start service in Phobrang,” Stanzin, who represents Chushul constituency in the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council, told TOI. Lukung is the gateway to the 135-km-long Pangong lake, a little over 150 km from Leh. Phobrang is the gateway to the Gogra and Depsang, areas of ongoing standoff between Indian and Chinese troops. Stanzin said good telecom connectivity in border villages are important strategically. “Villages are a key element of border defence. Our border villages are either not connected or the service is patchy. You can see more than one tower on the other side which have strong signal,” he said. The service quality also remains a point of grouse for villagers. “Yes, calls can be made from Merak and other such villages. But it is 2G service. So there is no internet or access to online courses. Villagers want at least 3G service. The government needs to pay more attention to this issue,” he said. Divisional commissioner Saugat Biswas said the government was alive to the situation and connecting all remote villages. “Satphones have been given to 80 villages with voice and data connection. V-SATS are being installed with localised internet service and 120 DSPTs have been approved. About 18-19 have already been set up and 124 tendered,” Biswas told TOI. In addition, 24 sites have been cleared under USOF (Universal Service Obligation fund) for setting up mobile services. But for Stanzin the capacity of the solar-storage unit at remote sites is also an issue. “We now have 5 KVA units. The harsh winter reduces the service life of batteries. These need to be raised to 10 KVA,” Stanzin said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/army-people-power-cell-service-in-village-on-pangong-shore/articleshow/82056945.cms||Sanjay Dutta

As part of the new curbs, no one—except those engaged in essential services and those exempted—will be allowed to move in public places without a valid reason, unless it’s for essential work. Only shops with essentials will be allowed to remain open. “The war against Covid-19 has begun once again, but this time the situation is worse than last year. And so we are imposing lockdown-like restrictions in the state. I urge the public to treat it like a ‘Janta curfew’ and follow it strictly,” said Thackeray. We are not calling it a lockdown, says UddhavMaharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray used Marathi word ‘sancharbandi’ for curfew but said “we’re not calling it a lockdown.” As per SOPs issued on Tuesday, public transport will continue to operate, with restrictions, mostly for people engaged in essential services or for offices exempted from restrictions. Home delivery of newspapers is also allowed. Officials said people can use public transport in emergencies, for essential activities or for a valid reason. Private vehicles can ply only for essential/emergency purposes. Restaurants and bars will remain shut but home delivery will be allowed. E-commerce deliveries have been restricted to just essential goods.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/stringent-curbs-in-maharashtra-from-8pm-today-to-may-1/articleshow/82056997.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Delhi||Delhi’s nearly 13,500 new Covid cases worst ever for any Indian city||NEW DELHI: The daily tally of Covid-19 breached all records on Tuesday with the city reporting 13,468 new cases in 24 hours. This is the third-highest in the country, after Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, both of which are much bigger in area and population size than the national capital. Earlier, on Sunday and Monday, Delhi had recorded 10,774 and 11,491 new cases, respectively.  The city also recorded 81 deaths due to Covid-19. It is the highest since December 3 when 82 deaths were recorded. Due to the massive rise in cases, the hospitals are overwhelmed. Data on real-time availability of Covid beds shows 64% of the total beds are occupied.  The occupancy of Covid ICU beds with and without ventilator stands at 90% and 82%, respectively. Lok Nayak, Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty, AIIMS Jhajjar, VIMHANS, Holy Family, Manipal, Max Patparganj and Shalimar Bagh, and Apollo hospitals have no ventilator beds available at all. Nearly 5% of Covid-19 patients develop severe symptoms. Such patients require critical care support which may include respiratory therapy using a high-flow-nasal canula or conventional ventilator. Given the situation of bed availability, doctors say, many patients requiring critical care may develop complications or even die due to the lack of timely intervention. Many hospitals are also reporting a shortage of anti-viral drugs and convalescent plasma.  “The demand for convalescent plasma has gone up four to five times in the past week. We are, therefore, giving it only to patients who are able to provide a replacement donor to maintain availability,” said an official at Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences that houses a plasma bank. Doctors say Covid-19 is happening in all age groups, including the young and children. Even people who have received both doses of the vaccine available in the country are developing the infection but the symptoms are not so severe in such cases, said Dr Rommel Tickoo, director of internal medicine at Max Hospital. “Till about a week ago, we had eight Covid-19 patients who required ventilator support. The number has gone up to 28 now,” Dr Sumit Ray, head of the critical care division at Holy Family Hospital said. Delhi’s total tally of Covid-19 has crossed 7.5 lakh which is the sixth highest in the country after Maharashtra (35.2 lakh), Kerala 11.8 lakh), Karnataka (9.9 lakh), Andhra Pradesh (8.8 lakh) and Tamil Nadu (9.5 lakh). With 11,436 deaths, Delhi’s toll is fourth highest in the country. Maharashtra has reported the maximum of 58,526 deaths, followed by Karnataka (13,008) and Tamil Nadu (12,945). The positivity rate of cases in the national capital went up to 13.1% on Tuesday from 12.4% a day earlier. Tuesday’s 13,468 cases came out of over 1 lakh tests conducted the previous day. Around 78,000 cases have been recorded in Delhi in the past 10 days, according to official data. Delhi recorded 7,897 Covid-19 cases and 39 deaths on Saturday. The positivity rate had also surged to 10.2%, breaching the 10% mark for the first time this year. The positivity rate was above 15% in mid-November last year, when the pandemic was at its peak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhis-nearly-13-5k-new-covid-cases-worst-ever-for-any-indian-city/articleshow/82057000.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||India||Govt fast-tracks nod for Covid vaccination cleared in other countries||NEW DELHI: With surging Covid-19 cases fuelling calls for faster vaccination, the Centre on Tuesday enabled faster access to foreign-made vaccines by doing away with bridging trial studies prior to grant of emergency authorisation for shots approved by recognised regulators like the US FDA or UK's MHRA. The changes in regulatory approvals are intended to increase availability of jabs amid a steep second wave of the infection. The vaccines can be imported in ready-to-use vials or in a fill-and-use form, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said. Foreign-manufactured vaccines granted emergency approval by drug regulators of the US, the EU, Japan and the UK or those listed with WHO for emergency use will be given the exemption. There will, however, be post-approval parallel bridging clinical trials in the Indian population for such foreign vaccines. Further, the first 100 beneficiaries of such foreign vaccines shall be assessed for seven days for safety outcomes before a wider rollout for the immunisation programme, the health ministry said. The change in rules should allow import of vaccines such as those made by Pfizer and Moderna. The government said it would carry out price and supply negotiations with vaccine makers. The decision to facilitate quicker access to foreign vaccines is expected to encourage imports, including import of bulk drug material, optimal utilisation of domestic fill and finish capacity which will, in turn, provide a fillip to vaccine manufacturing capacities and availability for domestic use, the government said. The decision to do away with pre-approval bridging studies is understood to reflect both the urgency of the situation and evaluation of evidence that many vaccines are doing well with millions of people having received the shots. “The National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC), after comprehensive deliberation, recommended that vaccines for Covid-19, which have been developed and are being manufactured in foreign countries, and which have been granted emergency approval for restricted use by USFDA, EMA, UK MHRA, PMDA Japan or which are listed in WHO (Emergency Use Listing) may be granted emergency use approval in India, mandating the requirement of post-approval parallel bridging clinical trial in place of conduct of local clinical trial as per the provisions prescribed under Second Schedule of the New Drugs & Clinical Trials Rules 2019,” the ministry said. “The decision has created an enabling regulatory provision to enable those foreign-made Covid vaccines that have been approved by credible foreign regulators,” Bhushan said, underlining that it denotes streamlining and fast-tracking of the regulatory system to increase availability and accessibility. Meanwhile, makers of Russian vaccine Sputnik V welcomed emergency use approval by India, saying 60 countries had allowed use of the shot that is seen to deliver 91% efficacy. Russian sovereign wealth fund RDIF said agreements were in place with Gland Pharma, Hetero Biopharma, Panacea Biotec, Stelis Biopharma and Virchow Biotech for manufacture. So far, India has granted emergency approval to three vaccines for restricted use. While Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Serum Institute of India’s Covishield are part of the national vaccination drive, the recently approved Sputnik V will be initially imported for distribution before local manufacturing begins. While Covaxin, being a locally developed vaccine, is undergoing full clinical trials in India, bridging studies to check safety, efficacy and immunogenicity in local population were conducted on both Covishield and Sputnik V before grant of emergency use authorisation. The decision to waive off the precondition is to expand the basket of vaccines for local use, particularly as the pace of the vaccination coverage is being accelerated.

While Johnson & Johnson is keen to enter India and has held preliminary discussions for applying for an emergency approval recently, Pfizer withdrew in February from the race due to regulatory issues. The rollout from Pfizer and J&J could take a few months as they need to decide their strategy, sources told TOI, adding Pfizer may face issues due to limited vaccine manufacturing capacity. The mRNA vaccine from Moderna will be months away, with the company being in early talks with CSIR for a possible tie-up, according to news reports. Experts say Pfizer could have the first-mover advantage since it was the first company which applied for emergency authorisation last year in December, provided it has enough doses for India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pfizer-jj-entry-could-still-be-months-away/articleshow/82057229.cms||---

Provisional data released by the finance minister showed that the increase was led by higher central excise and service tax collections as higher levies on petrol and diesel along with collection of arrears helped the exchequer. As a result, collections under these heads rose 59% to Rs 3.9 lakh crore in FY21. Similarly, net customs were estimated to have grown 21% to Rs 1.3 lakh crore. Given that imports were lower for several months, the spike may be on account of higher cost of several products. GST was the only area where collections were lower than the previous year. During 2020-21, the net mop up was estimated at close to Rs 5.5 lakh crore, around 8.5% lower than the previous fiscal year. “The 12% increase in the indirect tax collections comes on the back of a strong recovery in GST collections in the second half of FY21 together with the significant increase in the excise duty collections on petroleum products,” said M S Mani, senior director at Deloitte. The estimates suggested that net indirect tax collection for 2020-21 were 108.2% of the revised estimates. With gains on the direct tax side too, as collections were almost 5% higher, the Centre has ended up faring better than what it had itself estimated at the start of February, when finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Budget. Although expenditure is also likely to be marginally higher than the revised estimates, analysts are not ruling out a better-than-projected fiscal deficit. The government has budgeted for a fiscal deficit of 9.5% of GDP during 2020-21 due to lower than budgeted tax collections and higher spending on account of Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/net-indirect-tax-collections-up-12-in-fy21-beat-revised-estimates/articleshow/82057322.cms||---
---||India||India must re-evaluate ties with US after EEZ trespass: China media||NEW DELHI: After it said that disengagement in remaining areas in eastern Ladakh is going to be challenging, the Chinese official media wants India to re-evaluate its ties with the US following the trespass last week into India’s EEZ by a US warship and to avoid any “illusion” about Washington. “Historical experience tells us that the US is a country which can turn its back on any ally, let alone India, to pursue national interests,” said the hawkish Global Times, looking to milk the outrage in India over the conduct of the US warship. Noting that India conveyed its concerns to the US only two days after the US Navy transit, the mouthpiece said there were domestic voices in India arguing their country’s response was soft. Claiming that India was earlier vigilant towards Washington’s military presence and activities in the Indian Ocean region, the Global Times said in recent years, to cope with China’s rise, India has tended to become more tolerant of US naval operations. “But the US has always attempted to maintain its global hegemony. Given the strategic position of the Indian Ocean, the US will not easily discard its hegemony there, nor will it tolerate any country to share the hegemony with it. This will lead to frictions in strategic interests between the two countries," said the article. “To secure global hegemony and maintain the expansive operational scope of its navy, Washington has not ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea yet. Under the banner of ‘freedom of navigation’, it is common for US warships to trespass into the territorial waters or EEZs of other countries, including China," it added. Another piece in Global Times had said a day earlier that the fact that the two sides had not issued a joint statement after the military talks last week suggested disengagement in remaining areas in eastern Ladakh was going to be challenging. Chinese ambassador Sun Weidong had said recently that the disengagement in Pangong area was conducive to building mutual trust and further easing the situation on the ground. The publication quoted an observer to say though that some Indians have a "delusion of colluding" with the US, particularly with the US military, over the border dispute and playing "smart" despite reaching agreements, and this kind of move could damage the restoration of military trust between China and India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-should-re-set-ties-with-us-after-eez-trespass-chinese-mouthpiece/articleshow/82057501.cms||---

While the government has been tapping into surplus oxygen available with these sectors, over the last two-three days efforts have been initiated to get more supplies without affecting production. As part of the exercise, industry bodies are in talks with oxygen producers, which are typically smaller units, to see how capacity can be added quickly to meet the additional requirement, two people familiar with the development told TOI. Read our coronavirus live blog for all the latest news and updatesAccording to industry estimates, around 7,200 million metric tonnes of oxygen is available in the country, with half used for medical purposes and the other for industrial use. Industry sources said that preliminary estimates suggested that 20-25% of the supply available with steel units and refineries could be diverted for medical use.

The death toll increased to 1,72,085 with 1,027 daily new fatalities the highest since October 18“We do not know the exact quantity that can be diverted but steel companies have responded positively to the government’s request and increasing supply to some extent should not be a problem,” an industry executive said, adding that some companies have already committed to boost supplies.

While J&amp;J is keen to enter India and has recently heldOne of the challenges is to move oxygen from one part of the country to another. For instance, some of the steel units in Odisha have committed to additional supplies, but the requirement may be in Maharashtra, creating logistical issues as transporting it, and that too quickly, may not be easy. Industry bodies are mapping units where there is surplus that can be diverted. “We have been accessing surplus capacity since July-August, and we are trying to see if we can get some more,” said a government source. The move follows the Centre’s discussions with the states where the requirement for various products and services was assessed following a spurt in cases across the country. Several states such as Maharashtra have already sent an SOS to the Centre, seeking more supplies to ensure that patients with low saturation levels have access to oxygen.

The PM emphasised that global systems should adapt themselves, in order to address the underlying causes and not just the symptoms, as the world was passing through a watershed moment in human history in the backdrop of the damages caused by Covid-19. Addressing the inaugural session of Raisina Dialogue 2021, Modi said despite many constraints, India had supplied vaccines to over 80 countries, in what also seemed a response to domestic criticism that India has not provided enough vaccines for its own citizens. “We know that the supplies have been modest. We know that the demands are huge. We know that it will be a long time before the entire humanity can be vaccinated. At the same time, we also know that hope matters. It matters as much to the citizens of the richest countries as it does to the less fortunate,” said Modi. The PM said while trying to protect its own 1.3 billion citizens from the pandemic, India had also sought to support the pandemic response efforts of others. “In our neighborhood, we have encouraged our coordinated regional response to the crisis. Last year, we shared medicines and protective equipment with over 150 countries. We understand fully, that mankind will not defeat the pandemic unless all of us, everywhere, regardless of the colour of our passports, come out of it,” said Modi. Participating in a panel discussion on the first day, foreign minister S Jaishankar said there was a need for ensuring equitable access to coronavirus vaccines across the world as no one will be safe till everyone is safe and access can be ensured by ramping up production, including in countries like India. Jaishankar said India had been able to manufacture Covid-19 vaccine because of international cooperation. At the same time, there was nothing unusual in the tendency by countries across the globe to look at their own requirements, the minister said, and added that there was a need for a larger approach in dealing with the matter considering the difficulties being faced by smaller countries. Underlining that in diplomacy today, doing good is being smart, the minister said “vaccine maitri” reflects the larger outlook of “Vaisudhaiva Kutumbakam” (world is one family), asserting that health security is now integral to national security. “I think equitable access (to vaccines) is critically important in this. Because we all know that no one will be safe till everyone is safe,” Jaishankar said when asked to comment on the global approach in dealing with the crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-despite-local-constraints-india-sent-doses-to-80-countries/articleshow/82057665.cms||---
---||India||India to get apex body for maritime challenges||NEW DELHI: India will now finally have an apex federal body to handle all maritime affairs, from the coastline to the high seas, and ensure cohesive policy-making and effective coordination among the multiple authorities dealing with such issues in the country. “The organizational structure of a National Maritime Commission (NMC) has been worked out after inter-ministerial consultations. It is in the final stages now, requiring only the nod of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS). By the middle of this year, the NMC will become a reality,” says chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat. The exact contours of the NMC, which will “integrate” all the users operating along the coast as well as on the high seas, are not yet in the public domain. But sources say it’s likely to be headed by a “national maritime security coordinator” to usher in synergy among different stakeholders, ranging from central ministries and departments (home, shipping, fisheries etc) and state governments to the Navy, Coast Guard, customs, intelligence agencies and port authorities. India needs a “full-time framework” to handle the “vast and critical” maritime domain, which has too many players who often work at cross-purposes with diffuse responsibilities, said sources. The necessity for such an apex body has been stressed in the past also. But it could never take concrete shape due to turf wars, among other things. After the deadly 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks in 2008, for instance, a maritime security advisory board (MSAB), with a maritime security advisor as its chief, figured on the CCS agenda. The 2001 Group of Ministers’ report on reforming the national security system, after the 1999 Kargil conflict, had also underlined the need for “an apex body for management of maritime affairs for institutionalized linkages among the Navy, Coast Guard and ministries of central and state governments”. India, after all, has a long 7,516-km coastline including island territories and a two million sq km Exclusive Economic Zone. After the 26/11 strikes, the national committee on strengthening maritime and coastal security against threats from the sea (NCSMCS), with the cabinet secretary as its chairman, was set up in August 2009. But the NCSMCS meets only occasionally to coordinate among the 13 coastal states/UTs and other maritime stakeholders as well as review the progress of various coastal and maritime security measures. While several measures have been taken since 26/11, from a coastal radar network to state marine police stations, a lot still needs to be done to make maritime security relatively impregnable. Since 2018, the Navy also has the Information Fusion Centre-Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR) at Gurugram, which takes feeds and inputs from multiple sources ranging from coastal radars to satellites. It then fuses, correlates and analyses them to assess threats in the maritime domain. Last year, it monitored as many as 1998 incidents pertaining to various maritime security challenges. But a national maritime domain awareness (NMDA) project, basically an integrated intelligence grid to detect and tackle threats emanating from the sea in real-time, for instance, is yet to take concrete shape.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-to-get-apex-body-for-maritime-challenges/articleshow/82057894.cms||Rajat Pandit

The special court had given bail to Gogoi, who was booked under the stringent law for his anti-CAA speeches in 2019 on October 1 last year. "The dominant intention of the wrongdoer must be to commit a ‘terrorist act’ coming within the ambit of Section 15(1) of the Act… What, therefore, follows is that unlawful act of any other nature, including acts of arson and violence aimed at creating civil disturbance and law and order problems, which may be punishable under the ordinary law, would not come within the purview of Section 15(1) of the Act of 1976 unless it is committed with the requisite intention," the two-judge bench of Justice Suman Shyam and Justice Mir Alfaz Ali said. While even spoken words, including provocative speeches, can be construed as unlawful activity under Section 2(1)(0) of the1967 legislation, "the same must be done with the intention to cause death of, or injuries to any person or persons, or to cause loss of or damage to or destruction of any property aimed at disturbing the unity, integrity, security and sovereignty of the country", the bench said. The lower court had granted Gogoi bail after observing that the allegations brought by the agency could not, prima facie, said to be a terrorist act perpetrated with the intention of threatening the unity, integrity and sovereignty of India or to strike terror among the people. The NIA subsequently challenged the bail order in the high court. The basic allegations levelled by the NIA in its chargesheet are that Gogoi made provocative speeches, inciting the public to resort to violence and draw up a plan to set fire to houses belonging to people from the Bengali community living in the Amrawati Colony at Chabua in Dibrugarh district. "We are of the considered opinion that the views expressed by the learned Special Court, NIA, leading to granting of bail to the respondent is a possible view in the facts and circumstances of the case. Therefore, we do not find any error in the approach of the learned court below while exercising discretionary jurisdiction and granting bail to the respondent," the bench said. Gogoi, who is contesting the Sivasagar assembly seat this election, was taken into preventive custody by police on December 12, 2019 as protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill raged in the state, resulting in violence at several places. The case was transferred to the NIA two days later. He has been in judicial custody since.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/civil-disturbance-cant-be-uapa-offence-hc-upholds-bail-to-akhil-gogoi/articleshow/82057918.cms||Prabin Kalita
---||India||Rape conviction: HC wants Pocso judge sent for special training||The Patna high court has recommended special training for a trial judge while setting aside his judgment awarding 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment to an accused in a case of attempted rape. The accused had also been fined. The single-judge bench of Justice Birendra Kumar observed that evidence brought during trial did not establish any offence by the accused. The court ordered that the trial court judgment and the HC order setting aside the verdict be sent to the Bihar Judicial Academy to ensure proper academic training of judicial officers. The bench allowed the appeal of Deepak Mahto, who had challenged his conviction by the Pocso court in Bettiah, West Champaran, on June 15, 2019. The HC simultaneously allowed Mahto to be set free at once. The order was passed on Monday evening. The bench observed that the Patna HC chief justice may deem it proper for the trial judge, who passed the judgment, to undergo special training at the academy. A 13-year-old girl, in an FIR lodged with Inarwa police station in West Champaran on June 17, 2018, had accused Mahto of raping her. However, in her statement recorded before a judicial magistrate under CrPC Section 164, she alleged that Mahto attempted to rape her but did not succeed. Police submitted a chargesheet against the accused for attempted rape. Mahto was sentenced to 10 years' RI and ordered to pay a Rs 2 lakh fine on June 14, 2019. The court ordered him to pay the survivor Rs 1 lakh from the fine amount. The HC observed that the trial court accepted the conflicting facts in the FIR and the statement recorded under Section 164, but did not appreciate the lack of any substantive evidence. The HC also pulled up the trial court judge for referring to shlokas and ghazals of the late Jagjit Singh in his judgment. The bench observed that a trial judge, especially one having the power to award the death sentence, must have correct knowledge of legal principles and their proper application while exercising the responsibility of taking decisions on the life and liberty of a person. "Lack of knowledge of legal principles leads to miscarriage of justice and unnecessary harassment of the parties to the litigation. Bias and prejudices, conjectures and surmises and personal views contrary to the material on record have no place in a court of law," the HC observed. Senior advocate NK Agrawal, assisted by Vijay Anand, appeared for Mahto, while additional public prosecutor Zeyaul Hoda represented the state government. During the trial, the victim deposed before the court that she would not be able to recognise the boy (Mahto) if he was brought before her. Contrary to the FIR, in which the girl said her family members had caught the accused, she told the trial court that her family members had not been at home and that the villagers had, in fact, caught Mahto. The HC observed that the victim did not specify the kind of offence committed against her. It also observed that the girl’s mother, another prosecution witness, stated that she was asleep and the accused had already fled when she woke up. "The witness (mother) is also not specific about what the girl told her about the incident," the HC observed. The girl’s brother and father’s sister were declared hostile by the prosecution. The HC observed that the two doctors who had medically examined the girl and performed radiological examinations, respectively, were not produced before the trial court and their reports as exhibits were not substantive evidence unless they supported their findings in court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rape-conviction-hc-wants-pocso-judge-sent-for-spl-training/articleshow/82057926.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||India||Courts shouldn't interfere in police probe, except in exceptional cases: SC||NEW DELHI: Holding that the two organs of the state — police and judiciary — operate in their specific spheres of activities and one should not tread over the other's domain, the Supreme Court on Tuesday deprecated the practice of courts interfering in police investigations by passing orders routinely to stay probe or grant protection to the accused. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, M R Shah and Sanjiv Khanna said the investigation initiated by police ought not to be scuttled at the initial stage and courts can interfere by staying or quashing the probe only in exceptional cases when no prima facie case is made out against an accused and the case appears to have been lodged only to harass. Against the present practice followed not only by high courts but also the Supreme Court when a very brief order is passed to stay the probe without giving any reason, Justice Shah, who wrote the verdict for the bench, said a brief on the reasons is warranted in the order to justify why such an interim order is required to be passed so that it can demonstrate the application of mind by the court. "Police have the statutory right and duty under the relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code to probe a cognisable offence. Courts would not thwart any investigation into cognisable offences. It is only in cases where no cognisable offence or offence of any kind is disclosed in the first information report that the court will not permit an investigation to go on. The power of quashing should be exercised sparingly with circumspection," the bench said. It said extraordinary and inherent powers of the court do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction to act according to its whims or caprice and the courts should be cautious while interfering in criminal investigations. The bench said courts should not go into the merits of the allegations in the FIR when the investigation is in progress and police must be permitted to complete the probe. "It would be premature to pronounce the conclusion based on hazy facts that the complaint/FIR does not deserve to be investigated or that it amounts to abuse of process of law," the bench said and added that the FIR is not an encyclopaedia which must disclose all facts and details relating to the offence. "Quashing of a complaint/FIR should be an exception rather than an ordinary rule. Ordinarily, the courts are barred from usurping the jurisdiction of police, since the two organs of the state operate in two specific spheres of activities and one ought not to tread over the other’s sphere. The functions of the judiciary and police are complementary, not overlapping. Save in exceptional cases where non-interference would result in miscarriage of justice, the courts and the judicial process should not interfere at the stage of investigation of offences," it said. "Therefore, passing such type of blanket interim orders without assigning reasons, of not to arrest and/or no coercive steps would hamper the investigation and may affect the statutory right/duty of police to investigate the cognisable offence conferred under the provisions of the CrPC. Therefore, such a blanket order is not justified at all. The order of the high courts must disclose reasons why it has passed an ad-interim direction during the pendency of the proceedings under Section 482 CrPC. Such reasons, however brief must disclose an application of mind," the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/courts-shouldnt-interfere-in-police-probe-except-in-exceptional-cases-sc/articleshow/82057931.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

Health minister Mangal Pandey said in view of the rise in number of Covid patients, the government has decided to strengthen infrastructure at the PMCH. “The hospital will also ensure supply of nutritious refreshment and meals to the Covid patients,” he added. Pandey, who visited Nalanda Medical College and Hospital on Tuesday, said the number of beds at the hospital has been increased to 154. “Beds in Covid wards of other medical colleges, including Jawahar Lal Nehru Medical College and Hospital, Bhagalpur, will also be increased,” the minister said.. He added sub-divisional hospitals in the state would also be equipped with Covid treatment facilities and converted into dedicated health centres for the treatment of such patients. “At AIIMS-Patna too, 30 more beds will become functional for Covid patients from Wednesday,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pmch-gets-rs-1-5-crore-for-covid-test-treatment/articleshow/82054430.cms||---

While PU personnel management and industrial relations (PMIR) department head Govind Kumar has been seriously infected with the virus and admitted in a hospital, another senior teacher of the department has also reportedly tested Covid-19 positive. A teacher of Magadh Mahila College political science department and B N College Hindi department have also tested positive and are in home isolation. At least three more teachers and non-teaching staff of the university have also tested positive, according to PU sources. Even as the university on Monday notified that non-teaching staff of colleges and university are supposed to come on alternate day as per the time-table prepared by the heads of their institutions, no such notification has been issued for the teachers. They are supposed to stay in their departments on all working days and engage classes online. As the admission and registration process is also going on in different colleges, a number of students continue to visit their colleges every day and create a crowd-like scene. Both the students as well as the staff are in constant danger of getting infected with the virus, said Magadh Mahila College principal Shashi Sharma. Drawing the attention of the authorities concerned, Patna University Teachers’ Association (PUTA) president Shefali Roy pointed out that all campus activities should be stopped forthwith in the larger interest of teachers, non-teaching staff and students. These activities should resume only after the situation becomes normal and the pandemic subsides. She demanded that the teachers should be allowed to engage online classes or upload e-content to the university’s website from home. Meanwhile, according to a university notification, all the entrance gates except the centenary gate of the university have been closed and the entry of outside visitors has been banned until further order. In case of any emergency, a visitor would be allowed to enter only after obtaining prior permission from the authorities. All the teachers and non-teaching staff of the university would have to show their identity cards at the entrance gate. The campus in-charge (outsourcing) has been asked to get the entire premises sanitised regularly and to ensure thermal screening of all the people at the entrance gate, according to PU registrar Manoj Kumar Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/teachers-should-be-allowed-to-work-from-home-puta/articleshow/82054122.cms||B K Mishra

On Monday, the chimney on an electric furnace at Vadaj crematorium, which is handling the deluge of dead bodies, gave away with a few cracks due to excessive heat generated by day and night operations. They brought the chimney down for repairs as the furnace was halted for a few hours. “Against four to five bodies cremated on the pyres and at the furnace, the crematorium is handling 20-odd bodies daily for the past few days. Due to near-continuous operation, the inside of the mixed-metal chimney had started developing cracks and disfiguring due to melting. Thus, it was brought down for repairs,” said an official on condition of anonymity. The pandemic has resulted in the high death toll in the city and crematoriums are busier than 2020. Vadaj is not the only crematorium to replace the chimney – even at Chamunda crematorium near Naroda, the authorities brought down a chimney for maintenance due to similar reasons. In fact, the crematorium is creating two more slots on war footing to ensure that they can address the increased flow of over 20 bodies a day. In Surat too, the metal structures of furnaces at crematoriums have started melting because of its constant use amid the Covid-19 spike and at least 170 deaths. Similar is the case of city’s burial sites where for the first time, earth moving machines are being used to dig up graves to accommodate more dead bodies against the norm burying one body at one spot. “At Mora Bhagal burial place, a large grave was dug up using an earth moving machine to accommodate 22 Covid-19 deaths of Muslims on Tuesday.

In the picture, the MLA is seen sitting on a sofa while getting vaccinated by a woman donning an apron. TOI doesn’t verify the authenticity of the photograph. Incidentally, the Bombay high court on Friday last was irked over reports that some politicians in Maharashtra were getting vaccinated at home when there was no such policy and even PM Narendra Modi visited the hospital to get the jab. Dr Choudhary said he has also ordered an inquiry by forming a three-member committee of doctors on Tuesday. He said necessary action would be taken against the erring persons after getting the inquiry report. “The ANM visible in the photograph is from Saraiyya primary health centre (PHC) in Muzaffarpur. From this centre, the health staff had gone to the MLA’s residence,” he said, adding the PHC falls in the assembly constituency represented by the MLA. The civil surgeon said he had verbally asked the medical office in-charge (MOIC) of Paru as well Saraiyya PHC about it, but they did not say who had gone to the MLA’s residence or if he had reached the centre for vaccination. When contacted, the MLA told TOI over the phone that allegations against him of getting vaccinated at home were baseless. “I visited a sub-health centre at Gopalpur village to get vaccinated on Sunday.

The number of listed companies having m-cap of more than a billion dollar (approximately Rs 7,532 crore) has now increased to 22 from 17 within a year since April 2020. Although the equity indices have turned volatile currently amid growing cases of Covid-19 cases and its impact on various sectors, bull run on bourses since June last year has helped Gujarat-based companies enter the coveted billion-dollar club, said stock analysts. According to analysis of the Gujarati firms listed on BSE, the entities that made it to the billion-dollar (one billion dollar is approximately Rs 7,532 crore considering the value of rupee against dollar at 75.32) m-cap club in past one year are Deepak Nitrite Limited, Ratnamani Metals and Tubes Ltd, Gujarat Fluorochemicals Limited, Symphony Ltd and Eris Lifesciences Limited. Deepak Nitrite and Ratnamani Metals have made it to the elite club for the first time, the remaining three have reentered the club with a surge in valuations. As on April 13, Deepak Nitrite and Ratnamani Metals’ market cap stood at Rs 21,639 crore ($ 2.8 billion) and Rs 9,428 crore ($ 1.2 billion) respectively. Gujarat Fluorochemicals and Eris Lifesciences each had a market cap of Rs 8,037 crore (about $ 1 bn), while Symphony’s m-cap remained at Rs 8,425 crore ($ 1.1 bn). Adani Group tops the list of Gujarat’s most valued companies with its all the six companies being part of the billion-dollar m-cap club for long. In fact, the group’s four companies, except Adani Power and Adani Transmission, have market capitalisation of more than Rs 1 lakh crore or $ 13.2 billion. Other prominent members of this elite club are Cadila Healthcare Ltd and Zydus Wellness, Torrent Pharma Ltd and Torrent Power, Alembic Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Astral Poly Technik, AIA Engineering as well as state-run companies such as Gujarat Gas Ltd and Gujarat State Petronet Ltd to name a few. “Gujarati entrepreneurs have created huge wealth for their shareholders and product innovation is at the core of this wealth creation. The finest examples of this are Adani Ports, Cadila Healthcare, Zydus Wellness, Astral Poly and Symphony,” said Parth Parekh, fundamental analyst at Prudent Corporate Advisory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guj-billion-dollar-club-grows-bigger-at-22/articleshow/82055555.cms||Kalpesh Damor

In a letter to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, Shewale said since March 1, cases in Dharavi have been rising and the slum, which is home to people from the unorganised sector, is again witnessing reverse migration. “Most of the people living here worked during the pandemic. They are largely frontline workers such as nurses, ward boys, safai karmacharis, and many of them are below 45 years so cannot receive vaccination,” said Shewale. He urged the minister to allow vaccination for all above 18 years, adding that nearly 80% of the slum population is below 45 years. This would enable the Centre to replicate the model elsewhere, like Dharavi’s Covid control model. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of G/North ward which includes Dharavi, said the number of Covid positive cases in the slum were not as high as last year. “This time we are receiving more calls from Mahim and Dadar for beds in private hospitals. We are receiving requests from all over Mumbai for beds at Hinduja, Raheja and the waiting list for these two hospitals alone is 100 plus,” he said. On Tuesday, the BMC acquired Sushrusha Hospital at Dadar to function as a private Covid hospital with 50 beds, including 10 ICU beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-make-dharavi-slum-a-vaccine-test-case-says-mp/articleshow/82054283.cms||Clara Lewis

They are planning to meet the higher officials in the district including the collector, city police commissioner and corporation commissioner to explain their situation. The state government has allowed hotels to function till 11pm in the recently-released guidelines to prevent the spread of Covid-19 infection. Mohammed Rafiq Raja, president of Madurai district small eateries association said that police personnel on rounds ask them to close the eateries from 10pm onwards. Owners are being reprimanded if the police find them open beyond 10pm. “We are receiving information from our association members from various parts of the city in the last three days about incidents of police asking them to close early. We should be allowed to function till the time permitted by the government,” he said. Hotel business is immensely affected due to the Covid-19 infection. Many have shut shops due to the losses they incurred in recent months. Except for a section of eatery owners, many are not making any profits, he said. “We prepared a petition to be submitted to the authorities on Tuesday. Due to Ugadi festival on Tuesday and Tamil new year on Wednesday, we are planning to meet them on Thursday,” he said. President of Madurai district hoteliers association, K L Kumar said that they have contacted the police officials and raised the issue orally. Police have assured that there would not be any pressure from them to close early. The association too informed its members not to violate the regulations. Social distancing and wearing of masks should be ensured all the time in all the hotels, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cops-forcing-us-to-close-an-hour-early-say-hoteliers/articleshow/82055940.cms||---

---||Business||TCS to pay Rs 5,550cr dividend in FY22||Mumbai: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) will dole out a Rs 5,550-crore dividend, of which more than 70% will go to its largest shareholder Tata Sons. The dividend income from TCS will add to the kitty of the parent Tata Sons, which is preparing to submit a financial bid for the divestment-bound Air India and building new digital businesses in the wake of coronavirus. On Monday, TCS, while announcing its fourth quarterly numbers, proposed a final dividend of Rs 15 a share. This, however, will be paid after its shareholders’ approval at the June 10 annual general meeting. Tata Sons owns 72% of TCS and, accordingly, it will receive Rs 4,000 crore as dividend from the IT services company’s total payout of Rs 5,550 crore. Though the parent has pledged 0.47% of the TCS stake, it will receive dividend on the pledged stock. The pledgee will get the benefits only if the pledge is invoked, said a legal expert. TCS is the first blue-chip to announce a dividend payout during its Q4 earnings. It remains to be seen if other companies too would reward shareholders with high dividends or scramble to hoard cash amid rising Covid infections and increasing chances of stricter lockdowns in several parts of the country. IT companies and FMCG giants are expected to give dividends (since their business has not been hit). But fuel, travel & hospitality and other players will give a very small dividend, or none at all. A company’s decision to pay a dividend usually depends on its comfort with having sufficient cash flow for other purposes, after the payout. TCS had a free cash flow of Rs 37,968 crore as on March 31. In the fiscal 2021, TCS returned over Rs 30,664 crore to shareholders — a record — through buybacks and dividends. Parent Tata Sons, which benefited the most from the IT services subsidiary’s cash payout, will see this reflected in its fiscal 2021 revenue numbers. In fiscal 2020, TCS had accounted for 90% of Tata Sons revenue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tcs-to-pay-rs-5550cr-dividend-in-fy22/articleshow/82056042.cms||Reeba Zachariah
---||Business||G-sec buys to put pressure on rupee||Mumbai: The guarantee of easy liquidity by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) through assured purchase of government bonds worth Rs 1 lakh crore in the first quarter is putting pressure on the rupee. The interlinkage between the forex and money markets allows dealers to move funds between the two if they see an arbitrage opportunity. This makes it difficult for the central bank to control both — interest rates and the rupee. According to Care Ratings chief economist Madan Sabnavis, the RBI policy of providing even more liquidity to the system through the Government Securities Acquisition Programme, or G-SAP, though positive for the bond market is not so for the currency. Following the RBI announcement that it would purchase bonds under the G-SAP, yields softened by around 8 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point). However, the rupee has come under pressure. On Monday, the domestic unit fell 31 paise to a nine-month low of 75.06 asgainst the dollar. While one of the reasons for the fall was fear of the announcement of a lockdown after the Gudi Padwa festival in Mumbai on Tuesday, there are other fundamental factors at work. “A lot of liquidity means interest rates will remain low. If we look at the US 10-year yield, it is now 1.66% and has been going up, while our bonds are being driven down. For an investor, India becomes less attractive and we have already seen FPI for the month being marginally negative so far at minus $131 million,” said Sabnavis. This means that the rupee is likely to face choppy times ahead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/g-sec-buys-to-put-pressure-on-rupee/articleshow/82055987.cms||---

The slide came after the stock was removed from S&P Dow Jones sustainability indices because of its commercial relationships with Myanmar military. The change in the indices will be effective April 15, a release from the S&P Group company said. Adani Ports, the second-most valued company within Adani Group, has denied recent media reports about its links with the Mayanmar military regime. The S&P Dow Jones sustainability indices are followed by a large number of fund managers globally. The exclusion from the index would force all these funds to sell the Adani Ports stock. Local and global investors sold the stock ahead of the April 15 deadline for funds to rebalance their portfolios and hence the sharp slide, market players said. Late on Monday, S&P Dow Jones Indices said Adani Ports will be removed from the indices following a media and stakeholder analysis triggered by recent news events pointing to heightened risks to the company regarding their commercial relationship with Myanmar’s military, who are alleged to have committed serious human rights abuses under international law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/adani-ports-stock-dips-after-removal-from-sp-indices/articleshow/82056061.cms||---

In this backdrop, the state authorities have instructed immediate inspection of the said schools and have also asked the district education department officials to ensure that the inspection be conducted in such a manner that the schools situated on the outskirts are covered. “In a report that was prepared by the Uttar Pradesh government, it was found that inspection of at least 36,000 schools was not conducted by the education department authorities despite strict instructions to the effect. The inspection of 1.07 lakh schools was conducted against 1.44 lakh schools,” said Vijay Kiran Anand, director, Midday Meal Authority. In other words, 25% of state-run schools were not inspected. The inquiry in the matter found that a majority of the schools inspected were situated within city limits and close to the education department’s office. The top five defaulter districts where maximum schools are yet to be inspected are Agra (49%), Shravasti (45%), Kushinagar (42%), Pratapgarh (42%) and Kanpur Dehat (40%). “The inspections should be done in a manner that all schools in the state are inspected at least once a year. Instructions have been given to ensure that the instructions are followed or disciplinary action is taken against those who flout the norms,” warned Anand. As a routine, all schools are inspected to ensure that government schemes for students are being implemented properly and the beneficiaries are getting their dues such as midday meals or funds, free books and uniforms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/too-far-away-36k-govt-schools-not-inspected-in-up-last-yr/articleshow/82053811.cms||Ishita Bhatia

Dehydration, they say, may prove fatal in some cases. According to Patna-based veterinarian, Dr Vivek Kumar Singh, fresh water with oral rehydration solution should be provided to pets on a regular basis. They should also be given a bath every week instead of 15 days. “Avoid heavy meals and add yogurt to your pet’s diet,” Dr Vivek says. Meanwhile, many pet parents in the city are gearing up to protect their dogs and cats from the scorching heat. Aryan, a resident of Ashiana Nagar, takes his dog, Sara, on a walk early in the morning. He says, “I get my pet’s nails and hair chopped off regularly. I also give her enough water to drink and keep her indoors in the afternoon.” Another pet parent, Aayush, ensures that his Siberian husky lives in a fully air-conditioned room during the summer season. He also brushes her coat twice a week.

---||Business||Gig eco & work-from-anywhere can boost innovation||By Chaitanya SreenivasIn the new talent economy, human resources (HR) is strategic and acts to enable business leaders understand the skills landscape. This is done in an increasingly digitally transformed world driven by new age technology around cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), robotic process automation, advanced analytics, and natural language processing (NLP). The disruption caused by the unprecedented pandemic has accelerated these efforts and firmly put the spotlight on skills. Many business leaders across sectors today believe their employees must possess these new age skills in emerging technologies that are essential for the digital transformation of the organisation and to survive in the Covid era and beyond. For organisations to get back on their feet and reap the benefits of an economy on the rebound, skills are the key currency. Another inadvertent fallout of the pandemic has been the acceleration of the work-from-anywhere (WFA) model. With this shared economy model, organisations can access these new age skills with digital tools that were hitherto unavailable in a cost-effective manner. They recognise that building pertinent skills inside the organisation and leveraging such skills outside is vital to transform to the ‘new’ and remain relevant, given the changing skilling landscape. Revolution of the skilling landscape Businesses are increasingly seeking the new age skills in cloud computing, the Internet of Things, AI, ML, robotic process automation, advanced analytics and NLP as these technologies can drive growth for their organisation. According to an IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV) report — The 2021 CEO Study, 45% of CEOs who were surveyed in India expect AI and ML to produce business outcomes for their organisation within 2-3 years. Half of the respondents expressed confidence that they would see an upshot of NLP and voice technologies in their business in the next few years when compared to their global competitors. With these beliefs, business leaders are making efforts to imbibe these new age skills among their workforce. Rightly so, as Gartner’s Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies, 2020 identified AI and ML, among others, as the top emerging technologies that will significantly alter society and business over 5-10 years. With the new dynamics of the skilling landscape and the impact of Covid, organisations are making skills growth a key part of their performance management approach. An IBV study has confirmed this trend as 41% of the respondents said they were making skills growth integral to their performance management. It is not merely organisations that are growing significance of skills in the disrupted world — employees are also prioritising building their new age skills in 2021. Another IBV study showed that 92% of the respondents plan to develop their overall skills in the year ahead. Accessing new talent pools As the skilling landscape is transforming, plugging into new talent pools and embracing new models of talent acquisition is becoming imperative. The latest Economic Survey by the Indian government said that the country is one of the largest markets for flexi-staffing in the world. So, the concept is not something new. However, the pandemic has accelerated the need to tap this shared model effectively. Gig economy, coupled with the WFA model, can help organisations complement their existing channels of talent to discover new talent pools and new age skills. Some organisations are breaking away from the traditional parameters of hiring wherein qualifications and pedigree of the educational institutions become foremost. Today, agile companies have new-collar employees in their mix. These new-collar employees may not possess a traditional education background, but they have the new age skills and are digitally native who can perform their jobs well — be it gig or full-time. Agile companies realise that to innovate better, they need these diverse groups of employees. They are tweaking their hiring models to reflect these diverse talent pools as it empowers them to scale up rapidly according to the market demand. At the same time, it provides a gateway to niche skills and cost savings, while allowing them to improve their employee value proposition as well. In a world still under the pandemic’s grip, agile organisations are betting big on skills and finding newer ways to access them. Organisations that are not aligned with these changing dynamics of the new talent economy are more likely to not achieve the growth they aspire towards. The gig economy has blurred the lines of employment, opened the doors of opportunities and created new options. In a disrupted world, new age skills with a digital way of working and the gig economy are not merely buzzwords — they are imperatives you cannot ignore.

The FIR was lodged with the economic offences unit (EOU) police station in Patna. EOU sources said the matter would be investigated by it’s nodal agency for cybercrime in the state. Singh has also provided two cellphone numbers which are being provided to people while asking them to transfer money in two separate e-wallets. He has also provided an email ID created to open the fake profile. The cybercriminals have demanded Rs30,000 to Rs50,000 from several people known to Singh on social media after sending them friend requests from his fake profile having his photographs. However, it is yet not clear if anyone has actually fallen into the trap of the cybercriminals by transferring money believing that it's the minister who is seeking help. This is not an isolated incident before the EOU. Such forgeries have also taken place with a few IPS officers and even judicial officers in the state in the past. DG Alok Raj had thrice fallen victim to such cybercrime where conmen created his fake social media profiles and demanded money from his friends. They had also sent friend requests to people known to Raj and had then demanded money citing emergencies. Raj’s matter is also being handled by the EOU cybercell. Incidentally, EOU has released a detailed poster on April 9 that how can one act against cybercrime with such modus operandi. EOU had highlighted the steps to report a fake profile to the Facebook by users themselves for getting such profiles blocked. EOU ADG Nayyar Hasnain Khan had earlier said to avoid such incidents, a Facebook user should use the facility of locking his/her profile so that cybercriminals can’t copy photographs and other information from original profiles in order to create a fake one for duping people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/miscreants-create-ministers-fake-fb-page-to-dupe-people/articleshow/82054487.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Citing an assessment of data, he said: “The r-value of Covid-19 virus for Uttar Pradesh is over 2.1 which suggests that the infection is spreading fast. The national r-value is 1.32.” It may be noted that r-value or reproduction-value denotes a way of rating coronavirus or any disease’s ability to spread. Experts world over believe that R is the number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to, on average. Measles has an R number of 15 in populations without immunity. “An R-value above 1, even by a fraction, means the infection can snowball. If it’s below one, the outbreak may eventually subside,” Prof Surya Kant said citing the study. He said that the strategy to weaken the chain of spread rested on two pillars -- adherence to prevention protocol and vaccination. “Now many think that the two ways work individually but they actually function like two sides of the same coin. Also, one strengthens the other,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/virus-circulating-in-state-significantly-contagious-expert/articleshow/82056779.cms||---

Gaya, too, sizzled at 40.6 degrees C. Weathermen attributed the northward movement in the mercury column to warm westerlies causing discomfort, especially in the afternoon. The Patna Meteorological Centre claimed that the maximum temperature was in the 38-41 degrees C range across the state. A meteorologist here said the temperature is likely to prevail in the same range till Wednesday. Residents can, however, expect some respite from the scorching heat as thundershowers are forecast for Thursday and Friday. "Eastern and southern parts of the state are likely to witness a rise in moisture level from April 15 onwards owing to moist easterly winds in the region. A high level of moisture amid the prevailing high temperature is likely to lead to thunderstorm activities in those areas," the meteorologist said. He added that remaining places in the state are likely to witness dry or partly cloudy weather condition. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) also stated in its evening bulletin that Bihar is likely to witness thunderstorm with lightning at isolated places on April 16 and 17. Such turbulent weather in peak summer is locally called Kalbaisakhi or Nor’wester in meteorological parlance.

It is functioning like the media cell of the BJP,” Tejashwi told reporters here after returning from New Delhi on Monday. The EC had banned Mamata from campaigning on the ground that she had violated the provisions of Model Code of Conduct (MCC), Representation of the People Act, 1951 and the Indian Penal Code by making highly insinuating and provocative remarks laden with serious potential of breakdown of law and order and thereby adversely affecting the poll process. Tejashwi is scheduled to campaign for Mamata’s Trinamool Congress (TMC) in the constituencies having a large chunk of population from Bihar. He had earlier met Mamata in Kolkata on March 1. The RJD has given unconditional support to the TMC in West Bengal despite having an alliance with Congress in Bihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ec-functions-like-media-cell-of-bjp-says-tejashwi/articleshow/82054160.cms||Ramashankar

The second wave sweeping the country has come at a time when the economy was emerging from the bruising impact of the lockdown imposed last year to prevent spread of the disease. A Goldman Sachs Portfolio Strategy research report said its economists have revised down their overall calendar year real GDP growth forecast to 10.5% from 10.9% previously but it remains above the consensus forecast of 9.4%. “Our economists believe that the containment restrictions are likely to be more targeted with hits to specific services (such as food and beverages, leisure and recreation, transport) with limited spillovers into other sectors such as construction and manufacturing,” the Goldman Sachs report said. It added that activity is likely to rebound sharply from the third quarter onwards as containment policies normalise. On Monday, Japanese investment bank and brokerage Nomura said it was lowering the growth forecast for India to 11.5% from 12.4% in 2021. A day later, global ratings agency Moody’s Investors Service also cautioned about the impact of the sharp increase in infections on the recovery. “The second wave of infections presents a risk to our growth forecast as the re-imposition of virus management measures will curb economic activity and could dampen market and consumer sentiment. Retail and recreation activity across India had dropped by 25% as of April 7 compared with February 24, according to Google mobility data. This was mirrored in the Reserve Bank of India’s March consumer confidence survey, which showed a deterioration in perceptions of the economic situation and expectations of decreased spending on non-essential items,” the agency said in a report. But, the overwhelming view was the impact would be less severe than seen in 2020, given the focus on “micro-containment zones” to deal with the current wave of infections, as opposed to a nationwide lockdown. Yet, the lockdowns, even if localised and partial, will impact the economy as supply chains and production will be impacted, said industry players. Global financial major Barclays said current restrictions on mobility of people in economic hubs like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan may cause a weekly loss of $1.3 billion to GDP. If the current restrictions remain till May-end, the total cost could add up to about $10.5 billion. Barclays maintained its FY22 GDP growth forecast at 11% but warned “if the curbs are tightened further, then we see modest downside risks”. The fresh surge in cases also comes against the backdrop of sluggish economic data with industrial production contracting for the second consecutive month in February and inflation soaring to a four-month high in March.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/covid-surge-stokes-recovery-worries-hits-growth-forecast/articleshow/82056149.cms||---

With her achievement, it was also a success story for the hospital staff that could keep the centurion in good health and spirits despite having to administer oxygen support for nine days. Dr Jayesh Brahmbhatt, civil superintendent, said, “It’s a new milestone that we have achieved with the 102 year old woman who survived all odds. It’s possibly a first case of civil hospitals in Gujarat that a Covid patient of her age not only survived but could be discharged within 12 days of treatment.” The relief all around was palpable with doctors clapping in honour of the valiant fighter when she left the hospital after defeating the deadly virus. “It was nothing less than a war for me and I am the victor!” asserted the gutsy centurion who lives in Talaja road in Bhavnagar.Kojani was admitted to Sir T hospital on April 2, her oxygen level was deteriorating causing worry for the doctors. However, her high morale was never a problem which also kept the attending doctors’ spirits high. “It was a difficult task for us to save her life because of her age, health and low immunity. But it’s really a good success for us to be able to save a 102-year-old woman in this pandemic. It has been possible only because of her strong desire to live, the sensitivity and treatment of doctors and the nursing staff,” Brahmbhatt added. “I got very good treatment and the doctors and nursing staff in the government hospital took care of all my needs,” Kojani said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/corona-vanquisher-raniben-rescripts-102-not-out-her-way/articleshow/82054482.cms||---

Rural development department minister Shravan Kumar instructions have been issued to the district authorities to ensure 100 days of work to the returnees under MGNREGA in their respective panchayats, adding, that the number of returning migrants is not as high as it was during the nationwide lockdown last year. Also, women migrants workers would be associated with Jeevika Didi scheme so that they can earn their livelihood. Male workers will be engaged in the construction of animal sheds and the renovation of playground in panchayats. He assured that the migrant workers who still didn't own job cards would be provided one within two-three days of submitting the applications for the same. All they need to do is to contact their respective mukhiyas and the panchayat sachiv of the area. Last year, around 2.5 lakh job cards were issued to facilitate the migrant workers to get work, he added. The state government has also initiated steps to give benefits of the Ayushman Bharat health scheme to around 15 lakh registered migrant workers of the state. Under the scheme, expenses incurred on the treatment of the beneficiaries up to Rs 5 lakh each would be borne by the government. The state labour resources department is working on the proposal to bring the migrant workers under the ambit of the ambitious scheme. Authoritative sources said that the annual premium of the beneficiaries would be paid by the government. A sum of Rs.110 crore will be paid to the state health society for the purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/returnee-migrant-workers-will-get-job-opportunities-min/articleshow/82054304.cms||Ramashankar

All large businesses in the group will be self-sufficient and will invest in themselves,” said Anish Shah, who took over as MD & CEO of Group Mahindra earlier this month. Along with auto, FES, Tech Mahindra and Mahindra Finance, other sizeable companies like Mahindra Holidays and Mahindra Lifespaces — the group’s hospitality and real estate businesses — will also self-fund, he added. “Only select mid-size businesses like Mahindra Logistics, Mahindra Rural Housing Finance and auto recycling firm Mahindra Accelo will receive group capital,” he said. The group would now steer clear of diversification except in two businesses that it is currently considering. “We are looking at health tech and digital-led insurance because we like the space but it is at a very early idea stage right now,” said Shah. That apart, the focus will be on new growth areas for the core businesses. “For auto that would be electric mobility, for farm sector it would be implements, for Tech Mahindra a tech suite that’s more pan-industry and less telecom driven and for Mahindra Finance a digital focus on personal loan and consumer loans,” said Shah. The group has already announced a Rs 3,000 crore investment in electric vehicles and farm sector will also get a part of the Rs 9,000 crore capex announced for auto and FES to be spread over 3 years. There will also be no further exits. “We have done all the exits we wanted to,” said Shah. The next phase will involve a handful of the mid-size businesses becoming core business over time, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mm-core-business-to-self-fund-focus-on-phase-2-of-growth-md/articleshow/82055420.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

Atchannaidu was seen interacting with the party leaders in a hotel room in Tirupati where he was camping for the Tirupati by-election campaign. The comments purportedly made by Atchannaidu against Nara Lokesh, party general secretary, have sent shock waves in party circles. However, Atchannaidu was quick to condemn the contents of the video. He said the video was morphed and a plot by YSRC to create a wedge between him and Lokesh. Such cheap tricks, he said, would not make any difference to his bond with Lokesh and alleged the YSRC leaked a fake video ahead of the Tirupati by-election as it was worried about its prospects. The leaked video has, however, gone viral on social media as YSRC cadre seized the opportunity to push the TDP into a corner. A party leader Venkat (not visible in the video) who was interacting with the AP TDP president alleged there was no respect for those selflessly serving the party for the last several decades. Complaining about the dues owed to him by the party, he alleged that a senior leader had asked him to go along with the family for asking to have at least Rs 2 crore against a total due of Rs 7 crore cleared. Against this backdrop, Atchannaidu was heard saying the party would have been in a better position had that senior leader been fair in handling such matters. “We will get free after April 17 (by-poll). No party, nothing after that,” Atchnnaidu was heard saying.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/footage-morphed-atchannaidu-says-as-leaked-video-creates-stir/articleshow/82054800.cms||Samdani MN

The case of the prosecution was that on December 30, 2020, the applicants along with co-accused hatched a conspiracy to facilitate accused Vivek’s escape from the judicial custody. According to the prosecution, the applicants travelled from Agra and facilitated escape of the accused by providing him two-wheelers. During the escape, the accused resorted to firing from a revolver and used pepper spray. Counsel for the applicants Arun De Sa urged that there was hardly any material on record to connect the applicants with the active participation in the commission of offence. Public prosecutor Pravin Faldessai said that there is sufficient material at this stage to infer, prima facie, involvement of applicants in the crime and hence, the bail application should be rejected. “It can be noticed that there are no attributions against the applicants about providing dangerous weapons to the main accused. There are no allegations of assault by use of criminal force by the applicants so as to deter public servant from discharging his duty. As such, necessary ingredients for bodily offence cannot be inferred against the applicants. In my opinion, for both these applicants, case for grant of regular bail is made out,” Justice Nitin W Sambre observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/duo-accused-of-helping-inmate-escape-granted-bail/articleshow/82055928.cms||---

Accordingly, the public would not be allowed to offer prayers to the deities at the old Kalyana mandapam after the celestial wedding rituals are over. They will have to witness the culminating event from their homes on the temple website and other channels on April 24.Earlier, the temple authorities had decided to allow the devotees to witness the deities in their wedding grandeur, on the day of the celestial wedding on April 24, between 9.30 am and 2.30 pm. The temple usually closes for darshan from 12 noon to 4 pm. However, as it was pointed out that it could lead to overcrowding, they decided to allow only normal darshan on that day, said the temple’s executive officer K Chelladurai.The flag hoisting for the festival is to be done on April 15 and the coronation ceremony on April 22, while another ritual, Thigvijayam, will be held on April 23 and the celestial wedding on April 24.The next day’s event-- the car festival, which is held on the Masi Streets around the temple --will be held within the temple premises between 5am and 7am. Devotees would be allowed between 7am and 10.30am on that day. An officer, who wanted to remain anonymous, said it would be better if the guidelines like restricting entry for people above 65 years of age and children below 10 and Covid-19 vaccination certificates are stressed for entry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/temple-releases-chithirai-festival-calendar-of-events/articleshow/82055925.cms||---

Around the same time last year, similar complaints surfaced in tandem with the surge in caseload. Visakhapatnam district currently has 3,051 active cases. District collector V Vinay Chand told TOI that they have identified between 10 to 15 hospitals under the ‘B’ category for Covid-19 patients, apart from government hospitals, as per guidelines of the government. At the peak of the pandemic last year, the district had 22 ‘A’ category and 16 ‘B’ category hospitals, apart from government hospitals. “The problems would be addressed in a couple of days. We had notified a few hospitals last April. When the number of cases dipped, we denotified all private hospitals. We are in the process of notifying hospitals again,” the collector said. Many private hospitals, however, are admitting patients and charging more than Rs 20,000 per day even for patients with mild symptoms. “Many hospitals are admitting positive patients and putting them in the ICU and charging Rs 15,000 per day. We paid for my brother’s treatment in a corporate hospital,” a resident of Narsipatnam complained. Another patient who was admitted to a hospital near the district collectorate in Vizag had to pay close to Rs 2 lakh for three days before he was shifted to KGH. “In the wake of increasing cases, we are planning to arrange another 5,000 beds in different hospitals in the district. The process of notifying hospitals would be finalised by Friday,” district medical and health officer (DMHO) Suryanarayana said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/pvt-hosps-start-minting-money-as-caseload-rises/articleshow/82054920.cms||Siva G

The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) has started working on its crematoriums overtime to ensure more cremations are possible there. The VMC began work on around six crematoriums across the city almost simultaneously over the the last couple of days. Additional stands made of cast iron are being installed at these crematoriums and, in some cases, space available near them. An official said that the steps were being taken to ensure that there was sufficient space available for cremations if the number of deaths increased in the city. While the stands are being fixed or added within the existing premises at some locations, at Kalali these were being erected in the empty space near the crematorium. Sources said that arrangements for around 30 more pyres had been done so far. They added that the work was being done across different crematoriums at ward level and hence details were scattered and had not been compiled. The futuristic planning cell of the VMC that had earlier taken up work of sprucing up crematoriums was also roped in for work this time around. The Jambuva crematorium that was hardly used and in a bad shape has also been prepared to ensure that it was usable. At Khaswadi too around10 stands were added to ensure that cremations took place without any waiting time there. VMC standing committee chairman Dr Hitendra Patel who had gone to visit Khaswadi on Monday said that he had just gone there to ensure that things were in order. “I have been taking rounds as a routine exercise,” he said while playing down the addition of pyres there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vmc-readies-for-more-covid-deaths/articleshow/82054745.cms||---
---||Business||Dr Reddy’s may mop up $300 million in Sputnik V sales||MUMBAI: Dr Reddy’s Laboratories (DRL), which received permission from India’s drug regulator to import the Sputnik V vaccine, could potentially mop up around $300 million from its initial sales. The company has exclusive marketing and distribution rights for the first 250 million doses of Sputnik V vaccines in the country. This is assuming a base price of around Rs 150 per dose, the price at which the other two vaccines — Serum Institute’s Covishield and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin — have been procured by government, analysts say. DRL’s scrip, which witnessed a lot of action over the past few days, went down by over 4% on Tuesday to close at Rs 4,781 on the BSE. This may be because of uncertainty in the vaccine’s price, and lack of clarity over the launch as negotiations could take some time, and are tricky. The global price of Sputnik V is $10 (Rs 750). DRL is readying its launch strategy and more details will emerge soon, a company executive told TOI. Though negotiations on pricing could take a few weeks, the launch is expected over the next few months after DRL starts imports in May-June. The ramp-up in capacity will happen once the five contract manufacturers start producing in the country. Overall, a total of 852 million doses of Sputnik V will be produced in India alone over a year. At present, pricing and distribution of the vaccine is controlled by the government. Later, the opening up of vaccine distribution to the private market may lead to better pricing and margins for DRL, a note from broking firm Motilal Oswal added. The Hyderabad-based company had partnered with Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which is backing the vaccine, in September to conduct clinical trials of Sputnik V and distribute the vaccine in India. DRL conducted phase II trials on 100 volunteers and a phase III study on 1,500 volunteers in India as part of a bridging study to a larger global phase III study. When contacted, both DRL and RDIF did not comment on the pricing. Sputnik V uses two different vectors for the two shots in a course of vaccination, with an efficacy of around 91%. While Sputnik V is registered in 55 countries, interestingly, according to Bloomberg reports, Russia has vaccinated only around 4.6 million people (about 3.2% of its population). Trials are also under way for a Sputnik V and Oxford combined vaccine to study the immunogenicity and efficacy of combined use of the two vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/dr-reddys-may-mop-up-300mn-in-sputnik-v-sales/articleshow/82056025.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

Even guardians and well-wishers of students can contribute financially, the university has appealed, so that smartphones can be bought and data can be recharged. Several students in the university were unable to afford smart devices for online classes since campuses shut down in March last year due to Covid-19. University authorities decided to come to the rescue of the students by providing them with smartphones or recharging their devices so that they could attend classes like their other batch mates. Several other educational institutes, too, extended help to their students. Indian Institute of Engineering, Science and Technology provided smartphones to 700 odd students. At Presidency University professors keep track of students who are unable to attend online classes due to unavailability of smartphones or internet. The university then seeks help from local administration to connect the student digitally. Since August last year, JU has been providing smartphones and data recharge to several students. “After a survey, we identified 250 students who needed smart devices and another 800, who needed data recharge. The university helped them with the contribution from various communities on campus,” said an official.  The university has close to 1,050 employees and authorities are hopeful that this time, too, they will have enough funds to help the students. “Data recharge is a recurring expense. Not all students can afford smart devices and recharges. So, the university will once again extend help. The survey to identify the beneficiaries is underway,” said the official. Those willing to contribute need to email the university. The bank details have been provided on the website.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/online-classes-ju-move-to-bridge-digital-divide/articleshow/82055161.cms||Zeeshan Javed

We will bring down the party’s candidates with our votes.” Now in their eighth day of protest, the taxi operators said they will continue to gather at Azad Maidan, and may even bring their families along to hold the dharna with them. They also alleged that Lobo had gained power banking on votes of taxi operators and alleged that he is in favour of GoaMiles. “Lobo cannot kick our stomachs to build his political career,” they said. Tourist taxi union leader Bappa Korgaonkar said the taxi operators will not allow app-based services to function in Goa. “This is an election year and the leaders have shown us what their priorities are. We have our priorities too owing to which we have chosen to observe the dharna despite it being Gudi Padwa. None of the taxi operators have been brought here on gunpoint,” he said.

In many places defunct urinals have been shifted out but have not been replaced, say traders. Urinals made with steel walls were installed at various places including commercial hubs, parks and places where people gather in large numbers. They were set up on roadsides having less space - not enough construct a concrete structure. Although they proved to be effective in addressing open urination, people stopped using it as they became dysfunctional due to non-maintenance. Traders said that urinals lacked maintenance mainly from Covid-19 lockdown onwards, when the focus of corporation officials shifted to prevention of the infection. They did not look into it even after the infection rate came down in recent months, although near normalcy had returned. P Kallanai, an auto rickshaw driver from Tallakulam said, that a urinal kept near Tamukkam ground on the Gandhi Museum Road has not been functioning for the last three months. “It was installed a year ago. Cleaning was properly done only for the first few months. Later, when it was not properly maintained, people stopped using it for urination,” hesaid. H Ramamurthi, a grocery trader from Vilakkuthoon said there were at least three to four urinals in the vicinity until a few months ago. But they could not be seen anywhere now. “Most of the shops in the area do not have a toilet. Workers at the shops and people coming for shopping mainly rely on public urinals. There are hardly a couple of urinals buildings available now. But they too are not cleaned properly,” he said. Traders have urged the civic body authorities to install more urinals in busy areas.

---||Madurai||Parents, teachers fret as they brace for another uncertain yr||Madurai: With the Covid-19 pandemic already bringing physical classes for most students to a complete halt for almost a year in Tamil Nadu, the second wave of cases has left schools and parents in a spot of bother about the next academic year. They hope and pray that the virus comes under control at least by August so that schools can reopen in a phased manner. Usually by March, the academic year for state board students ends and two-month summer holidays begin, but this time there is no clarity yet. “There is no direction now regarding what is to be done as students progress to the next academic year, especially at primary and middle school level. If this past year was considered a zero academic year, it would be beneficial as students from lower classes would be able to learn properly by repeating the lessons,” said the headmaster of a government middle school. He further emphasized that government school students have had almost no education at all this year and many have forgotten even basic reading and writing. Teachers said that while at least older students bear some responsibility to study, Kalvi Tholaikatchi lessons haven’t been effective for lower classes. In private schools as well, teachers and students have been left fatigued by online classes, which are not a permanent solution. “There has been no direction on when this academic year ends or when the new one can start. However, most schools are moving on to the next academic year with online classes, especially some of the higher classes like Class IX and X. Parents are also keen to continue with online classes since they want their child to be engaged at home,” said M Senthilnathan, president, Private Schools Correspondents’ Confederation (PSCC). Another teacher and counsellor, R Nivethitha pointed out concerns over screen time of students and how students’ mental well-being is also affected the longer they are away from school. “Apart from online classes, if students continue to be locked up at home, invariably their digital screen time increases since they turn to social media, movies or games to be engaged,” she added. Parents meanwhile continue to be worried about the loss of school routine. K Meenakshi, a parent of a Class V student, said that for young children like her son, it would be difficult to get back to school routine if schools remain shut. “It is scary if we have only online classes for another year. This will greatly affect the learning development of children,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/parents-teachers-fret-as-they-brace-for-another-uncertain-yr/articleshow/82055962.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

But with the 10pm-5am curfew in place, they feel their business would be negligible this time. Zaeemuddin Ahmed, director of Karim’s Hotel in Matia Mahal, said: “People used to throng our hotel after finishing their Taraweeh prayers around 9-9.30pm. But because of the curfew, we have to start the process of closing our establishment by that time. Many of those leaving mosques after the prayers can’t sit and eat as they have to be home before the curfew begins.” Kallan Sweets, which is opposite Jama Masjid gate number 1, was established about 80 years ago and is known for its Ramzan fares like jalebi and samosa. Mohammad Shaan, co-owner of the shop, said: “We used to do a brisk business between 10pm and 4am, when there would be enough people around. People would travel from all across the city and from outside to eat in the Matia Mahal area. But all our plans are now in disarray.” “This year, the only way to earn is by selling items for the sunset iftar. Our business is 70-80% lower than usual,” he added. The curfew has hit hard those businessmen who were trying to recover from the losses occurred during the lockdown. Iftikhar, owner of Al Amaan Foods, claimed that many hoteliers were eagerly looking forward to this holy month. “We felt that we could make up for last year’s losses. We thought the people, who spent the entire Ramzan month indoors last year, would step out to eat and enjoy more this time. But the curfew has dashed all our hopes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/this-ramzan-pandemic-feasts-on-fear/articleshow/82074396.cms||---

In a minute-long video message released on Tuesday, Kejriwal highlighted the facilities provided by his government in Delhi, like free water and electricity and free bus rides for women, and said these can be implemented in UP too if people vote for AAP supported candidates. AAP is contesting the panchayat elections in UP for the first time, after which it aims to contest the 2022 assembly elections in the state. The party has already dispatched several Delhi MLAs to UP for panchayat election campaign. Asking people to vote for clean politics, Kejriwal said, “In the past six years, our government has done a lot of work for the people of Delhi. They get up to 200 units of power for free, children are getting world-class education for free, operations, medicines, treatment in hospitals is free, bus rides for women are free. All these facilities can also be provided in UP, but the key for it is in your (voters’) hands.” A party member said Kejriwal’s message would be taken across the state and will be played in all the party’s meetings and campaigns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kejriwal-vote-for-aap-get-free-water-power/articleshow/82056787.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Pune||Pune region: Laboratories reel under RT-PCR test burden, reports get delayed||PUNE: A more than five-fold increase in the demand for RT-PCR tests in the past fortnight is causing a strain on pathology laboratories in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) region, with most facilities complaining about the lack of testing kits, leading to a delay in giving reports. Pathologists said each laboratory was on an average processing around 100 tests daily during the early days of March. The number has now gone beyond 600 in most testing centres following the recent rise in Covid-19 cases. Some patients, as a result, need to wait for a week for their test results. The delay includes two to three days’ waiting for giving the swab samples and a couple of days more to get the result. Health experts and medical practitioners said such a delay in getting test results was defeating the entire purpose of carrying out the tests. “Some private laboratories are even planning to stop conducting RT-PCR tests,” a pathologist said. Most pathologists said besides the shortage of kits, manpower crunch, work overload and financial losses were also bothering the laboratories. “Small laboratories buy the testing kits at a higher price compared to the bigger ones. Besides, sending representatives to people’s homes for collecting swab samples adds to their financial burden,” a pathologist said. “The government has put a cap of Rs500 on RT-PCR tests. Smaller or medium-sized labs cannot manage on these rates. They are preferring to stay away from conducting Covid tests. The number of authorised testing labs is becoming limited and this is leading to a delay in test reports. A small lab gets the test kit for Rs400. Add to this the cost of manpower and overheads such electricity and there is hardly anything left for the labs,” he said. “The infrastructure available with the labs right now is less because of the increased demand. Steps should be taken to make sure that a perfect balance is maintained between demand and supply,” said Aparna Niphadkar Joshi, secretary of the Indian Association of Practicing Pathologists. “The number of authenticated Covid testing labs needs to be increased significantly to meet the high demand. Stringent norms should be set for giving permission to the new labs for conducting the Covid-19 tests. But the approval should be quick in case the lab meets all the requirements. Promotion of rapid antigen tests and increasing the number of centres for this will also reduce the load on labs overwhelmed with RT-PCR tests,” she said. Sanjay Patil, chairman of Hospital Board of India, Pune, said, “A study should be carried out about the RT- PCR tests recently mandated for workers and industries by the government. It should be assessed if such a compulsion is proving helpful. If the outcome of the study is not very satisfactory, the authorities must review the rule.” A pathologist said if a person was getting the test report after a delay of five-six days and the result was positive, conducting the test served no purpose. “The patient, till testing positive, keeps meeting people. This increases the chance of the virus affecting more people,” he said. The demand for swab collection is also very high. “Nearly 300 people used to enquire a day for the test before the mandatory requirement for the industry workers, food delivery executives and other service providers. Now, the enquiries have gone up to 1,200 a day. As many as 30 laboratories are conducting the RT PCR tests. One lab has already decided to stop the swab collection and processing of RT-PCR tests due to the increased pressure,” another pathologist said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/laboratories-reel-under-rt-pcr-test-burden-reports-get-delayed/articleshow/82056789.cms||---

The apex court on Monday rejected a petition filed by former Shia Waqf Board chief Wasim Rizvi who wanted the court to declare 26 verses of the holy book as “unconstitutional” on ground that they promoted terrorism. Vice-chancellor (VC) of Darul Uloom, Maulana Abul Qasim Nomani, said, “We welcome this decision from the depth of our hearts. The Quran is a divine book and there is no scope of addition or deletion of verses in it. The court has rightly exhibited its authority and it has done justice by slapping Rs 50,000 fine on the petitioner.” He added, “The Supreme Court has shown its position and its status by the decision. It has described the petition as insignificant. The decision has increased the confidence of people in justice and in courts.” The seminary had slammed Rizvi when he had moved the court with the plea. Clerics and prominent Muslim groups had also raised objection to it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/darul-hails-sc-decision-on-the-quran-says-it-has-increased-peoples-faith-in-judiciary/articleshow/82053829.cms||Mohd Dilshad

But when he reached Banda jail on April 7, he junked the wheelchair, got down and ambled down to his barrack even though he was wheeled into an ambulance at Ropar before his journey back to Uttar Pradesh. And after a week in prison, the lid has finally been blown off on his critical illness. Doctors treating him said, the gangster has no serious medical problems, only age-related complications. Banda prison authorities confirmed to TOI that Ansari refused a wheeler chair and preferred to walk to barrack no. 16. Prison officials said, a four-member medical team from Government Medical College, Banda, had examined him on that day and found no serious medical problems. His blood pressure and other vitals were stable. He also tested negative for Covid-19, a prison official told TOI. On April 9, Ansari claimed he was suffering from sore throat, headache and blurring of vision. “A team of experts examined him and found his headache was triggered by a minor refraction issue in the eyes. Medicines were also prescribed for his sore throat,” he said. Next day, Mukhtar again complained of cervical and lower limb pain, doctors were again rushed to his barrack and they attributed the discomfort to a temporal age-related issue, jail officials said. On April 11, a medical team again examined him and mentioned in his health chart that Ansari had a fasting blood sugar count of 160 and his all vitals were normal. They recommended monitoring of heart beat and blood sugar. Jail superintendent, Banda, Pramod Tripathi, said, “we made adequate medical arrangements inside the premises on directions of Supreme Court”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lid-blown-off-don-mukhtars-critical-illness-vitals-stable/articleshow/82056822.cms||---

The district-level task force headed by the district magistrate and 11 members excluding the basic shiksha adhikari (BSA) inspected 1lakh schools out of 1.4 lakhs (fixed by the education department) in the past six months. Over 36,000 schools, mostly in remote areas were untouched by the task force. As per the report, 49% schools in Agra and 45% schools in Shravasti were not inspected during the six months’ period. In Kushinagar and Pratapgarh, no inspection has been carried out in 42% schools, while in Kanpur Dehat, 40% schools were deprived of any physical inspection by the task force. In districts like Hapur, Varanasi, Baghpat, Basti, less than 5% schools have not been inspected. Set up at district and block level, the task force, otherwise aimed at constant surveillance of MDM scheme, was mandated with inspecting activities such as distribution of textbooks, bags, uniforms and to ensure MDM food security allowance reaches children in times of Covid-19 pandemic. The education department may not have been serving the mid-day meal due to school closure, but children, on directives of the central government, are being given MDM food security allowance since the lockdown. “Inspections were to ensure that allowance reaches the families and other activities are carried out properly,” said an official. Post the analysis, director, MDM authority, Vijay Kiran Anand has written to DMs to enhance participation in inspection of schools in remote areas so that quality of activities is not compromised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/task-force-skips-inspection-of-36000-govt-schools-located-in-remote-areas/articleshow/82056828.cms||Isha Jain
---||Nagpur||Viral post says GMCH dean blocked ward for mom; Dr Gupta refutes||Nagpur: A social media post alleging that dean of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) Dr Sudhir Gupta has blocked entire floor of the paid ward for his mother’s post-Covid treatment went viral on Tuesday. Dr Gupta, however, claimed the floor is reserved for non-Covid admissions as per government rules and his mother was admitted there for the last 2 months as a ‘common patient’ without violating rules.“Dean has captured whole floor of the GMCH for treatment of his mother,” claimed the post on social media which went viral. When TOI enquired, sources informed that the floor was vacant and Dr Gupta’s mother was the only patient there until Tuesday evening. She was a case of post-Covid cellulitis (bacterial skin infection). She has several other ailments too. Presently, she was under the plastic surgery department. Sources also informed that she was shifted to gastro ward of Super Speciality Hospital in the evening.Dr Gupta, however, claimed the social media post was a deliberate attempt to defame him. “My 85-year-old mother is under treatment from long. She was admitted in the paid ward which is reserved for non-Covid patients only. As VIP movement has been notified in Nagpur tomorrow (Wednesday), we have kept this floor vacant now,” said Dr Gupta. According to him, admission of his mother in the non-Covid ward violated no established rules.“My mother has been admitted there even before I took over as dean. She is a common patient and we are not availing any special services,” said Dr Gupta, adding he is also paying one nurse who is looking after his mother. “I am paying the nurse as per rules. We have everything documented. There is no violation,” he said.According to Dr Gupta, GMCH is already under tremendous pressure while handling the unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases. In such scenario, defaming fake messages create anger in public against government facilities.“We are here to serve people and we are doing every possible effort to provide service to every patient. Non-Covid patients are also important. Rules mandate such rooms must be kept vacant,” he said denying the allegation that he has captured the entire floor. What The Message Claims“Dean of the GMCH Dr Sudhir Gupta has reserved whole floor of 10 rooms in paying ward for his mother since last 2 months and appointed 2 senior doctors and 10 nursing staff round the clock. This is misuse of power.” What Dean Gupta Says“My ailing mother was admitted in that ward since last 2 months as per rules. The ward is non-Covid paying ward and that particular floor is reserved for VIPs. As city is going to see some VIP movement in next 48 hours, we have kept it vacant. I have appointed one nurse to take care of my mother and I am paying the expenses from my pocket. Everything is documented.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/viral-post-says-gmch-dean-blocked-ward-for-mom-dr-gupta-refutes/articleshow/82056006.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Flipkart, which is fighting a close battle with US e-tail giant Amazon for one-upmanship in India’s booming e-commerce market, will use Cleartrip to diversify and expand into other product categories, such as online bookings of hotels and flights, to boost its overall gross merchandise value (GMV). In addition, this will give Flipkart a strong toehold in the crowded online travel space and pit the e-tailer directly against market leaders, including Makemytrip, Yatra and Booking.com. Mumbai-headquartered Cleartrip, founded by Stuart Crighton, Hrush Bhatt and Matthew Spacie in 2006, has been severely impacted by travel restrictions brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. The acquisition of its closest rival Goibibo by Nasdaq-listed Makemytrip further dimmed its prospects in a field where margins in airline bookings are paper thin. Cleartrip, which earns more than 80% of its revenue from airline bookings, reported a 2.5% drop in revenues in FY20, while Goibibo zoomed ahead in the same period with an 11% increase at Rs 1,595 crore, which is nearly five times that of Cleartrip’s. The development comes close on the heels of Flipkart partnering with Ahmedabad-based Adani Group, led by tycoon Gautam Adani, to develop one of India’s largest logistics hubs and data centers. Industry experts termed the alliance as a strategic move that will help Flipkart march against not only Amazon but Jiomart, too. Apart from eyeing the controlling stake in Cleartrip, Bengaluru-headquartered Flipkart, which owns fashion e-tailer — Myntra, has been busy lately, picking up a 8% stake in Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail for Rs 1,500 crore and investing Rs 260 crore in Arvind Youth Brands, an arm of denim giant Arvind, that gave it rights to popular apparel brands such as Flying Machine. While its parent Walmart consolidated its wholesale operations in India by merging the business with Flipkart, the e-tailer led significant investments in startups such as hyperlocal delivery expert — ShadowFax and fresh produce supply chain company — Ninjakart. Cleartrip counts DAG Ventures, Gund Investment Corporation and Concur Technologies as its key investors and has last raised funds in 2016. A questionnaire emailed to a Flipkart Group spokesperson did not elicit a response.

The accused, Swajan Kumar Vikas was posted as SDM in Chitrakoot when a woman had lodged a FIR against him under Section 376 at Nawabad police station in January 2019. In her complaint, the victim had mentioned that she hails from Jalaun and had been living in a hostel in Jhansi. She came in contact with Swajan when he was posted in Jalaun. The SDM became intimate with her on the promise of marriage. The woman then lodged a complaint against Swajan accusing him of raping her on the false promise of marriage while concealing the fact that he is already married. The allegations were found true and Swajan surrendered in the court on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sdm-accused-of-rape-surrenders-in-jhansi-court/articleshow/82056834.cms||---

On Tuesday, the district recorded 1,162 positive cases. Of these, 1,148 people have contracted the virus through local transmission and source of infection in 34 cases was not known. The highest number of cases of the day were reported from Thrikkakara (67), followed by Vengola (47), Kalamassery (35), Tripunithura (33), Edathala (32), Alangad (31) and Vazhakulam 30. The test positivity rate (TPR) of the district touched 8.76% when more than 13,000 tests, including 8,000 RT-PCR were conducted. This is the first time the testing has crossed 13,000 ever since the pandemic struck the district last year. The district administration has appealed the general public to follow the protocols and get tested immediately in case of any symptoms like fever. “So far, only 10% of the population is vaccinated in the district and another 10% had been infected with the virus. Rest of the 80% is prone to the virus. Even cities, including Delhi, where 60 or 70% of the population were already infected, are witnessing rise in Covid cases. Thrikkakara continues to report high number of cases due to lack of cooperation on the part of primary contacts as they refuse to go under quarantine. There are many clusters, including IT companies and shops, in the region. The response of people is not different anywhere,” said a health official in the surveillance wing. The rising number of cases also put heavy burden on hospitals. The number of people getting admitted to ICUs also witnessed rise. On Monday, 90 people were there in ICUs, which almost doubled from the last two weeks. Authorities fear that the ICU admissions would skyrocket in the next two weeks as many are unwilling to get tested and go under quarantine. “The delay in identifying the infection and to undergo treatment will result in hospitalization, especially those with comorbidities. If they get admitted to ICU ventilator, survival will be difficult. One third of the patients who are in ICU are under ventilator support. If the current situation continues, Ernakulam will witness the same situation reported in other states where beds are full. We have infrastructure facilities and can increase it. But it is difficult to increase manpower support in health sector in the nick of time,” said the official. The number of patients undergoing treatment at hospitals, first-line treatment centres and houses are 7,358, including 445 in private hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ekms-covid-count-crosses-1000-again/articleshow/82055209.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Must enforce Covid norms, Calcutta HC tells EC||KOLKATA: The Calcutta High Court on Tuesday asked the Bengal chief electoral officer Ariz Aftab and all district magistrates to strictly enforce the Election Commission’s Covid norms, if required with police help. “We are dealing with an extraordinary situation and this calls for extraordinary measures,” the HC said, adding that anyone found flouting Covid norms, even during poll campaigning, “must be taken to task immediately”. The HC also said if necessary, the administration can also enforce prohibitory orders under Section 144 to ensure physical distancing. The HC has sought for a compliance report from the Bengal CEO when it hears the manner next on April 19. A division bench of Chief Justice Thottathil B Radhakrishnan and justice Arijit Banerjee, in their 14-page order, said: “Stringent measures must be taken against persons who fail, neglect or refuse to obey the Covid protocols. Callous and irresponsible attitude or behaviour of some of the members of society cannot be permitted to endanger the lives of other members of society.” The HC said that the measures were “absolutely necessary to avert a deadly disaster that is staring at our faces in the form of possible galloping rise in Covid-19 cases.” The HC also laid down a four-point guideline for immediate implementation. This makes masks mandatory at all gatherings, asks for sanitizers to be made available (in these gatherings) liberally and says safe distancing norms must be followed at all gatherings. The HC said the “administration shall do its best to ensure that there are no large congregations, and public awareness through distribution of pamphlet and miking should be resorted to.” The bench also urged political parties, all candidates, and campaigners “to ensure that at every gathering all persons present wear masks and maintain safe distancing norms.” The HC hoped that all “contesting candidates and their aides and associates would realise the enormous gravity of the situation and encourage all concerned to observe the Covid rules.” Hearing two PILs, which questioned the non-adherence to Covid protocols during the ongoing Bengal polls and linking them with the sharp spike in Covid cases statewide, the HC said while it was apparent that the EC and CEO Bengal have laid out guidelines, “they need to be implemented in the strictest possible manner. This is what the administration must do.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/must-enforce-covid-norms-hc-tells-ec/articleshow/82055210.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

While J&J is keen to enter India and has recently held preliminary discussions to apply for emergency use authorisation, Pfizer withdrew from the race in February due to regulatory issues.

Experts say Pfizer could have first-mover advantage since it was the first to apply for emergency authorisation last year, in December, but provided it has enough doses for India.

---||Delhi||Ammonia levels up even as supply by Haryana down, crisis likely: DJB||New Delhi: Delhiites may soon have to face another water supply crisis with Delhi Jal Board (DJB) claiming on Tuesday that the pollutant levels in the Yamuna have gone seven times beyond the maximum treatable limit, affecting the operations at water treatment plants. DJB vice-chairman Raghav Chadha said a double whammy was being inflicted upon Delhi by Haryana as the supply of water had reduced and the water was highly polluted with increased ammonia level. Chadha said a pandemic was going on and the Haryana government must wake up. “We demand that the Haryana government must supply water that it is legally designated to, and within the range of treatable ppm. Ammonia levels up to 1ppm can be treated, but the PPM levels are 7.6ppm right now, which is untreatable,” he added. DJB states that the pond-level of water that should be maintained by Haryana at 674ft is currently at 670 ft. “The festivals of Navratri and Ramzan have commenced, while Covid-19 is at its peak. In the wake of this, we are witnessing an extremely disappointing and disturbing picture in terms of water supply,” Chadha said. “Even world-class water treatment plants cannot purify and treat the water that is being supplied,” he claimed. Approximately 40% of the water supplied in Delhi is provided by Haryana. The water supply will inevitably be impacted in parts of central, south and west Delhi, says DJB. “In Wazirabad plant, 135MGD should be the optimum capacity, which was reduced to 82MGD on Tuesday, meaning a shortage of 53 million gallons per day. In Chandrawal, we produce 92MGD of water, which has been reduced to 71. In Okhla, we produce 21MGD and the shortfall is 11MGD. So, in total, 85MGD of the water supply has been reduced,” an official said. The areas likely to be affected include Old Secretariat, Civil Lines, Lahori Gate, Old Sabzi Mandi, Naya Bazaar, Peeli Kothi, Malkaganj, Motia Khan, Jhandewalan, Baraf Khana, Patparganj, Rajendra Nagar, Karol Bagh, Central Secretariat, Parliament House, President House and Cantonment. In south Delhi, such localities include RK Puram, Vasant Vihar, Akbar Road, Sarojini Nagar, Kalkaji, Tughlaqabad, Giri Nagar, Lodhi Colony, Defence Colony, Moolchand and Sundar Nagar. Raj Ghat, Majnu Ka Tila, Ramlila Maidan, Delhi Gate, Punjabi Bagh, Mukherjee Nagar, Model Town, Hudson Lane, Azadpur Mandi, Shalimar Bagh and Burari are also likely to be impacted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ammonia-levels-up-even-as-supply-by-haryana-down-crisis-likely-djb/articleshow/82056114.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Vax can be taken during Ramzan: Fatwa||Lucknow: If you are observing roza and wish to get yourself vaccinated for Covid-19, there is no need to worry about your fast, according to a fatwa issued by a prominent Sunni cleric on Tuesday. “At a time when vaccination has become a necessity to stay safe from Covid-19 pandemic, devotees can go for vaccination while fasting for Ramzan,” said Maulana Khalid Rashid Farangi Mahali in a fatwa issued on a query regarding vaccination. To help fasting Muslims during Ramzan, helplines being run by both Shia and Sunni clerics are flooded with such questions. There are women centric helplines too where questions are being answered by women educated in Islamic laws. “Roza observed by devotees does not break due to Covid vaccination, which means that those who wish to and are allowed to get vaccination, should do so. Vaccination is an intramuscular injection, hence not digested. Therefore, it won’t break your fast. We are encouraging Muslims to go for vaccination as a part of their commitment to their well-being,” said Maulana Khalid Rashid Farangi Mahali. Among other queries that callers have put forth recently ahead of Ramzan include if a devotee is experiencing Covid symptoms, how should he observe the fasting month, and what is the code of law to avoid Covid-19 or any other infection or disease. “Those who are experiencing Covid symptoms should immediately get themselves tested and not observe roza this time. For the ones who are not well, the instructions of the Prophet for the devotee is to first visit a doctor and take their suggestions. It is also mentioned in the Hadith Shareef that kalonji (nigella seed) keeps every illness at bay. Therefore, it should be taken during sehri and iftari,” the cleric said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vax-can-be-taken-during-ramzan-fatwa/articleshow/82056852.cms||Aditi Singh
---||Nagpur||5 patients die at Kandri CCC for want of oxygen, proper care||Nagpur: Five patients in advanced stage of corona infection died at a newly opened Covid Care Centre (CCC) at Kandri near Kanhan in early hours of Tuesday allegedly without adequate treatment, oxygen and other specialized care required. It is learnt there had been more deaths elsewhere in rural areas due to shortage of beds or oxygen in hospitals. Though police records say four died due to want of oxygen, it is learnt another woman died on her way to a city hospital in ambulance. District administration had last month converted a portion of the Western Coalfield Ltd’s (WCL) Jawaharlal Nehru hospital at Kandri into a 48-bed CCC that had 16 beds with oxygen. Disturbed by the loss, a relative of the deceased patient resorted to violence ransacking the hospital . Kanhan police reached the place and brought him under control. The district administration and WCL officials informally traded charges for not providing enough manpower for managing the patients. “We had supplied adequate oxygen cylinders at the CCC,” said a senior health official. The patients, including two women from Tekadi village, were compelled to stay back at Kandri’s CCC, where only rudimentary treatment is available, as they could not find beds in any hospital in Nagpur or Kamptee despite having tried for hours. Having been admitted a day ago, district administration sources stated, the four patients’ oxygen saturation was hovering between 60% and 70% when they had to be accommodated at a place where there were not even adequate doctors or nurses to manage such serious condition. It is learnt, there were 29 patients at the CCC facility which was handed over to the district administration towards the end of March. It could not be made fully operational due to lack of doctors and nurses. On April 10, animal husbandry minister Sunil Kedar had visited the centre following which the district administration is learnt to have allotted two nurses and a doctor. On Monday, a doctor from WCL and two nurses on duty. Ex-zilla parishad member Shivkumar Yadav said the doctor on duty from WCL (Dr Prasad) had repeatedly called up an incharge as the oxygen supply was depleting and the condition of the patients worsening. “The WCL doctor tried to contact his in-charge and senior but could not succeed,” said Yadav. District administration sources stated the patients who died were too serious to be admitted at CCC but they had to stay there as there were no beds vacant in any hospital. SP Rakesh Ola said a case of accidental death was registered at Kanhan police station. “We have also registered an offence against the kin of the deceased for venting his ire on the hospital and pelting stones on the glasses,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/5-patients-die-at-kandri-ccc-for-want-of-oxygen-proper-care/articleshow/82055964.cms||---

Most of the shops in Ernakulam witnessed very good sales in the wake of Vishu. The firecracker sellers were hopeful of overcoming the crisis created by the pandemic with the Vishu business this year. With the number of Covid cases rising, the business is done with strict adherence to Covid protocols. “Last year’s Vishu was dampened by the Covid-19 lockdown and we suffered severe loss as shops were not even open due to the restrictions. The crackers stored for the festival could not be sold and most of them have wasted away. This time, the business is pretty good though the pandemic restrictions are there. Many families have come to the shops to buy crackers. Compared to the pre-covid times, the business is nearly half. But it is a huge respite from the loss we suffered last year,” said Babu Antony, owner of Senorita Crackers, Kakkanad. Many shops have introduced new types of crackers – mostly fountains, ground spinners, sparklers, poppers and snakes --to get the attention of buyers, especially kids. The pandemic too has inspired firecracker makers and there is a new item called ‘Corona’, a sparkler in the shape of the Coronavirus. Most of these items are imported from factories in Sivakasi, Tamil Nadu. However, many sellers said that rains in the evening for the last few days slightly dissuaded people from buying crackers. Moreover, people prefer those crackers that give importance to light and colours than sound as many fear action by authorities for noise pollution. Meanwhile, the Kochi city and Ernakulam rural police have strengthened surveillance to crackdown on illegal storage of firecrackers. Police teams are deployed to check the licence of sellers and ensure that safety guidelines are followed in storage places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cracker-sales-pick-up-in-city-ahead-of-vishu/articleshow/82055211.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: Now, an e-portal for aqua farmers||KOCHI: Union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal on Tuesday virtually inaugurated eSaNTA, an electronic marketplace to connect aqua farmers and buyers. The platform would enable farmers to get a better price and exporters to directly purchase quality products from farmers thereby enhancing traceability, a key factor in international trade. The term eSaNTA, electronic solution for augmenting national centre for sustainable aquaculture (NaCSA) farmers’ trade in aquaculture, was coined for the web portal. NaCSA is an extension arm of marine products export development authority (MPEDA), which is under the ministry of commerce & industry. The portal is a completely paperless and end-to-end electronic trade platform between farmers and exporters. Farmers have the freedom to list their produce and quote their price while exporters have the freedom to list their requirements and also to choose the products based on their requirements such as desired size, location, harvest dates etc. Speaking on the occasion, Goyal said that eSaNTA would raise income, lifestyle, self-reliance, quality levels, traceability, and provides new options for aqua farmers. He said that the platform would change the traditional way of carrying out business from a word-of-mouth marketing to become more formalized and legally binding. He said that eSaNTA would raise the lives and income of farmers by reducing risk, awareness of products and markets, increase in income, shielding against wrong practice and ease of processes. The minister said that the portal was a digital bridge to end the market divide and would act as an alternative marketing tool between farmers and buyers by eliminating middlemen. It would revolutionize traditional aqua farming by providing cashless, contactless and paperless electronic trade platform between farmers and exporters, he added. “The portal can become a tool to advertise collectively the kind of products the buyers, fishermen and fish producing organizations are harvesting. People in India and abroad can know what is available. In the future, it can become an auction platform,” he added. The platform is available in many languages. It provides detailed specification of each product and it is backed by an end-to-end electronic payment system with NaCSA as an escrow agent. After crop listing and online negotiation, a deal is struck, advance payment is made and an estimated invoice is generated. Once the harvest date is fixed, the buyer goes to the farm gate and the produce is harvested in his/her presence. Once the harvest is completed, the final count and quantity of material is verified, the final amount is decided and delivery challan is issued. Once the material reaches the processing plant, the final invoice is generated and the exporter makes the balance payment. This payment is reflected in the escrow account. NaCSA verifies it and accordingly releases the payment to farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/now-an-e-portal-for-aqua-farmers/articleshow/82055227.cms||---

He directed the health officials to expand the facility at the earliest. To ramp up testing and increase the number of RT-PCR tests, the UP government has also decided to start BSL level two laboratories in 12 districts. The new labs have been proposed for Amethi, Auraiya, Bijnor, Kushinagar, Deoria, Mau, Siddharthnagar, Sonbhadra, Bulandshahr, Sitapur, Mahoba and Kasganj, said additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad. The decision was made after Yogi directed officials to intensify ‘test, trace and treat’ strategy to control Covid-19 spread. “Testing must be increased to weaken and break the chain of virus spread. In addition, facility to start RT-PCR tests at autonomous medical colleges should also be explored. Testing should be ramped up in the private sector too,” the CM said. In another important decision, Yogi directed health staff to reserve 50% ambulances for Covid-19 patients. “The RT-PCR labs will be set up either at district hospital or an equivalent hospital. Efforts are on to make these labs functional at the earliest,” Prasad said, adding that the labs will increase the state’s capacity to conduct more RT-PCR tests. Meanwhile, over two lakh Covid-19 tests were conducted in the past 24 hours, of which 97,000 were done through the RT-PCR method. In addition, the state government re-assigned the TB testing TruNat machines to the district units to ramp up testing. “More than 300 TruNat machines will be provided to the districts,” Prasad said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/double-testing-for-covid-19-at-kgmu-rmlims-says-cm/articleshow/82056884.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Poddar was shot dead at Deen Dayal Chowk in Munger on the night of October 26. Dhillon has been shifted to Samastipur as SP replacing Vikash Burman. Patna rail SP J Jalaraddy has been posted in place of Dhillon. Burman got posted as the new Patna rail SP. Before Dhillon, the state police headquarters transferred three inspectors and 10 sub-inspector rank officers to different districts who were associated with the investigation in the murder case of Poddar. The high court directed the state government for shifting the SP and other police officers involved in the investigation for free and fair probe in Poddar’s killing. However, it had observed that order to shift them elsewhere must not be taken as an indictment of all these officers and no adverse inference shall be drawn against them. The high court is monitoring the investigation into Poddar’s killing being carried out by state police CID. This is the second time in five months that the SP of Munger got transferred. Earlier it was then Munger SP Lipi Singh who was removed on the directions of the Election Commission on October 29 last year soon after violence erupted against Munger police and district administration over the killing. DM Rajesh Meena was also removed along with Singh. The violent mob had torched two police stations and two police outposts along with patrolling vehicles on October 29. Assembly election was going on at that time in Bihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/munger-sp-transferred-on-hc-direction-in-police-firing-case/articleshow/82054957.cms||Debashish Karmakar

---||Lucknow||After one-year pause, govt to release MLALAD funds||Lucknow: After suspending MLA Local Area Development (MLALAD) funds during the pandemic’s first wave, the state government has decided to release its first instalment for the current fiscal. This comes just ahead of the panchayat elections and the high-stakes assembly elections due next year. In a communique to chief development officers (CDO), additional chief secretary (rural development), Manoj Kumar Singh said, an instalment of Rs 1.5 crore would be released to each legislator of the assembly and legislative council. “The state government would release Rs 750 crore for the purpose soon,” stated the April 12 order. In April, last year the state government suspended MLALAD funds for a year to mop up Rs 1,500 crore for Covid care. The state cabinet also decided that legislators, ministers, including the chief minister would take a 30% pay cut and the money saved would be ploughed into the Covid fund. The state government on April 18, 2020, however, announced raising the MLALAD corpus from Rs 2.40 crore to Rs 3 crore per annum and the state budget for 2021-22 earmarked Rs 2,000 crore for this purpose. The rural development department said, funds allocated to legislators would be utilised as per rules and government orders issued from time to time. The finance department has also been issuing directions as per the budget manual. The funds will not be allocated in case a seat is vacant. The order said, legislators would be informed about works sanctioned within a week by respective chief development officers (CDO), who will also be responsible for quality of work under the head.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/after-one-year-pause-govt-to-release-mlalad-funds/articleshow/82056919.cms||Pankaj Shah

As on Tuesday, 2,379 remdisivir injections were consumed in Aurangabad, of which, 437 were used by government hospitals while 1,624 by private hospitals. The remaining 318 vials were shared as ‘inter government transfer’ as they were required on priority. Authorities said that the effectiveness of the drug has resulted into the sudden surge in demand due to which recently there have been incidents of black marketing, including the one in Parbhani where a man was caught for selling the drug in black market at a higher price. District collector Sunil Chavan said that the district has enough number of remdisivir injections for now and all precautions are being taken to ensure that there is no black marketing of this essential drug. Medical authorities suggested that remdisivir, which is believed to be one of the most effective drugs in fighting against viral load in the body, should be used judiciously. District civil surgeon Sundar Kulkarni said, “The need for remdisivir injection is increasing with the rise in number of cases.” He said that his hospital at Chikalthana is, too, consuming a large number of remdisivir injections every day. However, a senior medico from the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) said, “Government hospitals are treating patients with comorbidities as well as those who are extremely critical, but they are still requiring lesser number of remdisivir injections.” However, private practitioners have contested that as on date, private hospitals are catering to more number of patients than all the government hospitals in the district put together.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/pvt-hosps-consume-more-remdisivir-than-govt-hospitals-fda/articleshow/82053905.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Delhi||Master plan: Future-ready Delhi with housing for all||NEW DELHI: Delhi Development Authority gave preliminary approval to the draft Master Plan for Delhi (MPD) 2041 on Tuesday. The plan aims to make the capital a more sustainable, liveable and safe city with housing for all and better economic opportunities. The document takes into consideration national and international best practices to make Delhi ‘future-ready’. The draft MPD-2041 was according preliminary approval at the meeting chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, and will now be placed in public domain by the first week of May for objections and suggestions from the public. “We have prepared a comprehensive forward-looking document to make the city sustainable, liveable and vibrant,” said DDA vice-chairman Anurag Jain, adding the document focused thoroughly on all aspects from tackling air, water and noise pollution to boosting the city’s economy. “Apart from walkability and cyclability, the draft MPD also incorporates urban design concepts like ‘eyes on the streets’. A lot of research and hard work has gone into it and it incorporates many best practices,” Jain said. The plan is laid out in six sections in two volumes, covering environment, economy, transport and mobility, heritage, culture and public spaces, shelter and social and physical infrastructure. The plan contains strategies and specific norms for guiding future spatial development of Delhi, covering both green field and brown field development, including land pooling, green development area, regeneration of planned and unplanned areas, transit-oriented development (TOD), etc. In a statement, DDA said the draft plan aims to make Delhi an environmentally responsible, future-ready digital city focusing on ease of living, good quality, affordable, clean and safe living environments and efficient mobility options to all, vibrant place for economic, creative and cultural hubs, attracts talent and facilitates livelihood opportunities for everyone and inclusive health facilities. The plan aims at ‘compact’ and sustainable development through TOD-based projects to bring jobs and homes closer to mass transit. It desires regeneration of the old and dilapidated areas, re-densification of localities and provides for improving social infrastructure in urban villages and unauthorized colonies. For the first time, the plan would be GIS-based and multi-layered to make it easy-to-read and to enable anyone to find out exact policies and provisions in every zone. Explaining how the draft preparation beat both the barriers of time and the Covid-19 outbreak, Jain said, “We kept aside time every week for the work and kept moving forward. Apart from interaction with experts, focused group interactions were also carried out.” The issues were finally discussed with the LG, who is chairman of DDA. Jain said that some policies like those related to TOD, green area development and additional development control norms for land pooling were brought in as amendments to MPD-2021 itself instead of waiting for MPD-2041. DDA plans to tackle air, water and noise pollution by adopting ‘extremely strict’ codes and will promote reuse of treated waste water for horticulture and irrigation, mandatory dual piping system, green credits as part of incentivised development, and optimal utilisation of available water supply. “All MPDs since 1962 have an emphasis on the environment. That is why one-fifth of Delhi’s area consists of greens. The new plan has also considered climate change,” said AK Jain, former DDA planning commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/master-plan-future-ready-delhi-with-housing-for-all/articleshow/82056133.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Kolkata||West Bengal government activates 1,000 more Covid beds to tackle second wave||KOLKATA: To deal with the rising number of active cases, the state health department has jacked up Covid beds in government facilities in Kolkata by around 1,000 while asking private facilities to augment their intake capacity. The state has also taken a slew of measures — like deputing more manpower and forming various medical teams tasked with different responsibilities — to counter the second wave. On Tuesday, Bengal recorded 4,817 fresh cases and 20 deaths. Kolkata recorded 1,271 new cases and 11 deaths. TimesViewAll the recommended measures must be rolled out on the ground as soon as possible. It is best to learn from the experience of the other metros, where the current wave has started before ours, and not repeat the mistakes they may have made.“We have enhanced beds in MR Bangur Hospital, ID Hospital and Medical College Hospital while Calcutta National Medical College and RG Kar Medical College have been added to the existing Covid treatment facility in Kolkata with 50 and 60 beds respectively,” said an official at Swasthya Bhawan. The government has also activated KS Roy TB Hospital in Jadavpur as a 130-bedded Covid hospital. “Currently, the hospital is catering to 40 plus patients. Specialists including that of chest, anesthesiologist and medicine have been deployed and we are expecting more doctors and support staff to cater to critical care patients,” said Somnath Mukherjee, South 24 Parganas CMOH under which the Jadavpur hospital is operational. Hospitals like MR Bangur, which operated 441 beds till Sunday, had run out of beds. Now, the hospital has got an additional 272 beds, taking the total to 713. The decision to increase bed numbers from 300 to 660 at Medical College Hospital, however, saw a section of junior doctors protesting. They reasoned that this move will hamper service to non-Covid patients and that other teaching medical colleges should be made to bear the load. The health department on Tuesday told private hospitals to augment Covid beds. While some hospitals have already increased beds marginally, all hospitals felt that hiking up the number sharply was not feasible as they had a good number of non-Covid occupancy this time unlike last year. But all agreed to gradually augment beds as and when these become available. The health department has also formed a five-member team comprising specialists, including emergency medicine specialist Sarbari Swaika, general medicine specialist Partha Sarathi Karmakar and community medicine specialist Anirban Dalui, for analysing every Covid death, identify gaps in treatment and suggest corrective measures. Three teams, headed respectively by tropical medicine specialist Bibhuti Saha, general medicine specialist Soumitra Ghosh and Jyotirmoy Pal, have been tasked for supportive surveillance and monitoring of treatment protocol in different government Covid facilities. The health department has also activated a five-member team headed by critical care specialist Sugata Dasgupta of RG Kar Medical College to visit critical care units in government hospitals and look out of improvement in treatment and other protocols. “We are reactivating some of the teams we had during the first wave while initiating new teams so that we face the second wave in our best way,” said a health department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/govt-activates-1000-more-cov-beds-to-tackle-second-wave/articleshow/82055248.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Aurangabad||Tourist taxi association demands rescheduling of EMIs||Aurangabad: Tourist taxi association members from Aurangabad on Tuesday made a written representation to the district collector demanding that their vehicle loan instalments should be rescheduled for a later period as the current pandemic situation is making it impossible for them to repay the loans. With the imposition of lockdown last year, hospitality and tourism industry have remained the worst hit sectors, bringing the economy in these sectors to a screeching halt. It has also resulted in scores of people losing their jobs, especially those who were directly as well as indirectly dependent on these sectors. In the written representation, association members have explicitly stated that due to restrictions, none of them are in a position to pay the monthly bank instalments of their vehicles. “Out of tens of hundreds of taxi vehicles plying in Aurangabad, about 80% vehicles have been purchased through loans. Due to restrictions, none of the owners are being able to earn even a single penny, making it impossible for them to repay their loans,” said president of the association Sanjay Halnor. Meanwhile, taxi union members said that most of the vehicles are new as there is a constant pressure from the customers. “Tourists and commuters prefer vehicles that are not only of the latest make, but also in good condition. This constant pressure forces the taxi owners to replace the existing vehicle every few years by obtaining a vehicular loan,” said Rama Temkar. He said that vehicles of the older models end up losing business at some point. “Tourist taxis are solely dependent on the movement of tourists and commuters, but restrictions on movement and travelling have come as a big blow to us,” said Suresh Suryawanshi, a member of the association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/tourist-taxi-association-demands-rescheduling-of-emis/articleshow/82053912.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Javed, of Shaheen Bagh, had packed the body of Galib Hussain in a bag and thrown it in a drain. He suspected the occultist of having an affair with his wife.Ludhiana rural SSP Charanjit Singh Sohal said, “A murder case was registered on the statement of Anil Kumar of Langeana Basti, Moga, a sanitary inspector of Jagraon municipal council.

---||Meerut||UP Panchayat polls days away, demand for illegal arms shoots up||MUZAFFARNAGAR: A tamancha, countrymade pistol, goes for Rs 3,000, a musket for Rs 6,000, a gun for Rs 10,000 and a rifle for Rs 15,000 — the underground arms market is thriving as UP prepares for the panchayat elections, which kick off on Thursday. Illegal arms units have been working overtime, demand has shot up and prices have more than doubled since the panchayat election was announced, higher than ever before. “Illegal weapons are in high demand because of the upcoming panchayat election,” Muzaffarnagar SSP Abhishek Yadav said. Those on the ground believe it is because of a “vendetta-based politics” at the grassroots level. “Panchayat elections are usually very sensitive. Old rivalries come to the fore, coteries form around candidates. It’s a high-stakes affair. This time, counterintuitively, police raids on illegal arms units seem to have driven prices up,” Asad Zama, a Muzaffarnagar-based lawyer, said. Muzaffarnagar, like Munger in Bihar, is identified as a hub of arms making and specialises in countrymade weapons. UP itself keeps topping the list of number of legal arms licence permits, Union ministry of home affairs data show, with over 19,000 fresh permits issued between January 2018 and September 2020 at the last count. But the underground arms market, it is believed, is much bigger. The latest National Crime Records Bureau data from 2019 show UP had the highest number of illegal arms seized in the country, nearly 37,000 (nearly half of the country’s 76,000), followed by Madhya Pradesh at a distant second (over 14,000) and Rajasthan (over 7,000). Consequently, raids keep happening every few days in the crime-prone district of Muzaffarnagar, but the rate at which operations are being unearthed this election has been alarming. Over the past 16 days alone, police have busted 15 illegal arms manufacturing units across Muzaffarnagar and seized hundreds of weapons — some of them half-way assembled — along with ammunition. At least 24 people have been arrested so far, the latest on Monday at Kakrauli. And the operations seem to have moved to fields and farms — vast, empty, isolated spaces with little oversight expected. On Saturday, for instance, an illegal arms unit was found operating inside a sugarcane field beyond a forested area in Charthawal. A day before that, a unit was found functioning inside a mango orchard near Budhana Marg. But as the busts continue, demand has gone up. “The production has been hit. But demand remains high. That has pushed prices up,” Nagar Kotwali police station SHO Yogesh Sharma said. In a raid on Sunday, for instance, they found out that a countrymade pistol that would usually sell for around Rs 1,500 even a month ago now goes for Rs 3,000. “The raids will continue,” SSP Yadav said. “Hopefully, our drive to ensure peaceful panchayat elections will help.” UP Police, meanwhile, has seized over 5 lakh licensed firearms before the panchayat polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/panchayat-polls-days-away-demand-for-illegal-arms-shoots-up-in-up/articleshow/82053919.cms||Mohd Dilshad

---||Delhi||Rental housing in focus with eye on locations close to Metro stns||New Delhi: Synonymous with flats ranging from those for higher income groups to one-room Janta flats, Delhi Development Authority (DDA) will now be focussing on ‘rental housing’ for the first time, as part of its Master Plan for Delhi (MPD) 2041. The draft MPD was preliminary approved in the authority’s meeting chaired by LG Anil Baijal on Tuesday. According to a statement from DDA, the draft MPD-2041 will focus on non-ownership or rental and small format housing. The MPD-2041 also aims at incentivising new formats like serviced apartments, condominiums, hostels, student housing, worker housing, etc. The plan is to have such small format housing particularly close to mass transit corridors like the Delhi Metro. The proposal is modelled on the affordable rental housing complexes (ARHCs), initiated by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs. The ARHCs are aimed at providing ease of living to urban migrants and the poor in different sectors, according to the ministry’s website. “The focus on non-ownership or rental housing is aligned with the national policy,” said DDA’s vice-chairman Anurag Jain, adding this proposal would help in housing for all. He said that many other countries have experimented with rental housing earlier. AK Jain, former commissioner (planning), DDA said that the proposal was in line with Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Urban, which already has a rental housing portal. “This came up last year and aims at the migrant workforce, which might also include those who visit the capital for work for a few months in a year and then go back to their native places,” he said. “DDA should make the best use of land and go for dense development but also ensure that these buildings are green and low on carbon emission and energy use, which is good for climate change,” he said, adding that it is also important to ensure these dwelling units are cheaper to build and affordable for users. According to sources, while the rental housing scheme would come into effect when the MPD-2041 is finally notified by the ministry, DDA would be simultaneously working on a mechanism on how to implement the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rental-housing-in-focus-with-eye-on-locations-close-to-metro-stns/articleshow/82056151.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Mumbai||Mumbai 2nd wave may be at its peak, says panel member||MUMBAI: Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani visited the Dahisar and Nesco jumbo Covid centres on Tuesday. He said there were beds, both with and without oxygen, at the centres. Dr Rahul Pandit, head of intensive care in Fortis Hospital, Mulund, and a member of the state task force on Covid-19 said that Mumbai is possibly at the peak of the second wave. “This week looks like the peak in Mumbai, but numbers could continue to be high for a couple of weeks more,” Dr Pandit said. Districts such as Akola and Amravati that were the first to register a surge in cases in early February seem to have peaked and their daily tally of cases is starting to decline, said Dr Pandit. A BMC official admitted that supply of oxygen and the antiviral remdesivir was an issue in Mumbai but said there was nothing that the BMC could do about it as these issues were managed by the state government. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said that the state was being very transparent with its testing numbers and deaths. He said that most RT-PCR labs in the state were full and were functioning will full capacity. “Most of our resources that we had augmented are also falling short but we are working towards expanding them,” he said. Cabinet minister and guardian minister for Mumbai city Aslam Shaikh said 5,300 more beds were being added in Mumbai, of which 70% will have oxygen supply facility. He said that bed management in the city is being handled centrally by the BMC, but shortage is being reported as some people want to get admitted to private hospitals, where the waiting period is more,” he said. “Some celebrities from the film industry and cricketers had mild symptoms or were asymptomatic, but they got themselves admitted to major private hospitals and occupied beds for longer periods,” he said. Shaikh said if they had avoided getting admitted to hospitals, the state could have accommodated needy Covid-19 patients. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region added 16,596 cases and 46 deaths taking the total cases to 11.1 lakh. Deaths touched 21,245.

KCR had not campaigned in Dubbak and this was one of the main reasons for the defeat of the TRS, said a senior TRS leader, adding this was, by and large, the opinion of party cadre in Dubbak. His public meeting in Nagarjuna Sagar will be a morale booster for the party cadre in the crucial last two days before the polling on Saturday. However, the party cadres are perplexed at the absence of TRS working president KT Rama Rao from the campaign. They are expecting that KTR will hold at least one roadshow on April 15 on the last day of campaigning. However, none of the TRS leaders could confirm whether KTR will hit the road to canvass for Bhagat. Energy minister G Jagadish Reddy and MLC Palla Rajeshwar Reddy are overseeing the arrangements.  “The Congress and BJP leaders know they would lose the election. KCR’s meeting will only increase the majority of Bhagat,” Jagadish Reddy said. On the fears about spread of Covid-19 due to a huge gathering of people, Jagadish Reddy said they are not mobilising people. “We have only appealed to the people to attend KCR’s meeting and that they should wear masks. All Covid-19 guidlines would be followed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-meeting-set-to-provide-heft-to-bhagats-prospects/articleshow/82055260.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Lucknow||Night curfew small step, says Allahabad high court, asks govt to consider lockdown in surge dists||PRAYAGRAJ: Taking a serious note of the current surge of Covid-19 pandemic, the Allahabad high court on Tuesday directed the UP government to look into the viability of complete lockdown in districts where the coronavirus spread has increased alarmingly for at least two weeks or three weeks. The court further directed that all public gatherings must be restricted to 50 persons immediately. Hearing a PIL relating to Covid-19, a division bench comprising Justice Siddhartha Varma and Justice Ajit Kumar made it clear that if the court is apprised on the next date fixed of anyone moving on roads without mask, the court shall take it as an act of contempt on the part of police and will certainly haul up the senior superintendent of police (SSP), Prayagraj and other concerned districts for the same. The court also directed the district administrations to religiously comply with the guidelines issued by the state government on April 11, 2021 to check the spread of Covid in the state. The court emphasized that the immunization programme must be vigorously carried out through vaccination of a large number of people and directed the Central government and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to rethink extending the benefit of vaccination to students pursuing higher education and those appearing in Board examination of high school and intermediate looking at the largescale infection in population of younger generation. “If the Board and other examination conducting bodies are going for offline examination, then the government must explore viability to extend the benefit of vaccination to such students as well,” the court added. Passing the above directives, the court observed, “Night curfew or corona curfew is a very small step. It can curb only night parties and large religious congregations in the coming month of Ramzan and Navratri. What we need to ensure is that there is no unnecessary public movement even during day timings. We know that when a river acquires velocity no bund can stop it and yet efforts are made to restrict it. We need to restrict public movement at least for a week or 10 days to break the chain. If life survives one would regain wealth and improve his economy. After all, every development is for people and if there are no men there will be no use of any development activity.” “We understand that complete lockdown for weeks together may not be feasible but looking at the current surge of pandemic, we direct the government to look into the viability of complete lockdown in those districts where spread has increased alarmingly,” the court further directed. “The situation is so alarming that if it is not handled carefully and cautiously we may lead to a stage of complete collapse of the public health system,” the court added. Expressing concern over insufficient infrastructure to meet the Covid patients’ requirements, the court directed the UP government to acquire open places in the city areas of districts that are the worst hit in the state, to set up temporary level 1 hospital in a make-shift structure. “Arrange manpower on contract basis immediately to serve all those who are admitted to temporary level 1 Covid hospitals/centres,” the court directed. “We must give priority to public health over elections and the government is expected to streamline every department of public health and public care in the light of the observations made hereinabove,” said the bench while fixing April 19 as the next date of hearing in the case. The court directed the state government to file an affidavit of an officer not below the rank of secretary in this court by the next date fixed detailing out the measures taken in the light of the observations made hereinabove. The court also directed that the district magistrate and chief medical officer (CMO), Prayagraj shall appear through video conferencing on the next date fixed. Besides, the court directed that a copy of this order be sent to the chief secretary, government of UP, district magistrate and SSP, Prayagraj, Lucknow, Varanasi, Kanpur and Gorakhpur within 24 hours for immediate necessary action at their end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/night-curfew-small-step-says-hc-asks-govt-to-consider-lockdown-in-surge-dists/articleshow/82056942.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Farmers worried over lockdown affecting sales in ramadan||Aurangabad: The increase in restrictions coinciding with the holy month of Ramadan has added to the worries of fruit growers from the drought prone Marathwada region. Several farmers having access to sufficient water grow fruits which give considerable returns during the holy month, when the demand for fruit grows manifold. But much to the angst of the fruit growers, citing rising Covid cases, all the weekly markets in rural areas have been closed by the administration across the region. Moreover, not all the farmers have means to transport their produce to urban markets or get them delivered at home. In addition to this, there are no affordable means available for the farmers to preserve their produce and sell them when markets reopen. Fruits need special care and watering to keep them fresh. In the current scenario, amid lockdown uncertainty, farmers don’t want to waste water as well.. Kutubkheda based farmer Ramesh Pathade, a marginal farmer, had planted watermelon last year, but the lockdown caused him serious financial losses as his entire produce was wasted. “As things started to return to normalcy in November last year, we expected that we would make up for the losses during this Ramadan season and accordingly planted watermelon on two acres, but with introduction of fresh restrictions, we fear our produce may get wasted again,” he said. Dinkar Kolge of Chincholi, who planted cucumbers ahead of summer season, said, “Due to lockdown restrictions, my family members are trying to sell the produce on the highways. In the past one week, my son could not make even Rs 500.” He said that planting of cucumber on one acre requires a minimum investment of about Rs 25,000 to Rs 35,000 and during the summer season, the returns range from from Rs 80,000 to Rs 1 lakh. Story of Beed farmer Prashant Dhas is no different. He said, “I spent about Rs 1.5 lakh on erecting a green house and planting cucumber. I was expecting Rs 4 lakh in returns from the produce, but now, I am set to incur heavy losses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/farmers-worried-over-lockdown-affecting-sales-in-ramadan/articleshow/82053920.cms||Mohammed Akhef

These two containers were said to be carrying scrap, but more than 100 multifunction printers (MFPs) of leading brands were found stuffed inside. As per the preliminary investigation by the department, so far 72 MFPs have been found in one container and the examination of the other was on till the filing of this report. The value of the confiscated goods as of now was reported to be around Rs 1 crore, but would increase as it was being suspected there were 150 MFPs in both the containers. A highly-placed source in the DRI said a Patiala-based firm had imported these two containers in December-end and these were lying here ever since as the importer had not got them released. Based on specific inputs, additional director general of DRI Nitin Saini formed a team to keep a watch on these containers.

---||Vadodara||Duty waiver sought for Rs 16 crore drug||Vadodara: Minister of state for ports, shipping and waterways Mansukh Mandaviya has sought a waiver of customs duty for a gene therapy drug to treat Spinal Muscular Atropy (SMA) in a child hailing from the Mahisagar district. The drug costs Rs 16 crore and funds for the same are being crowdfunded in the state. Three-month-old Dhairyarajsinh Rathod, son of Rajdipsinh and Jinal Rathod, was diagnosed with SMA Type 1. The disease is rare and a genetic ailment that in its advanced stage makes it difficult for the child to carry out basic activities including vital functions like swallowing and breathing. It can be life-threatening. The drug Zolgensma used to treat the condition costs around Rs 16 crore and is said to be the costliest drug available. The family is from a humble financial background and is not in a condition to bear the expense. The family has resorted to crowdfunding for the child. Several groups in the state also did collections for the baby and have handed these over to the family. Mandaviya has written a letter to union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman seeking a waiver of customs duty on the injection. Mandaviya has stated that the injection attracts a custom duty of Rs5-6 crore. He has said that in a recent case in Maharashtra, the duty was waived off. Apart from Dhairyaraj’s case, Mandaviya has also sought a general waiver in such cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/duty-waiver-sought-for-rs-16-crore-drug/articleshow/82054754.cms||---
---||Meerut||Huge consignment of steroids seized from Baghpat||MEERUT: A joint team of UP Police and drug inspectors arrested two Delhi-based individuals from Baghpat on Tuesday for allegedly smuggling a huge quantity of steroids and injections to be distributed at various gyms in western Uttar Pradesh. The accused were identified as Devender Kumar from Uttam Nagar and Kunal Sharma from Najafgarh. A case was registered against them under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and IPC sections 420 (cheating) and 274 (adulteration of drugs). According to police sources, the drugs were meant to be sold to aspiring bodybuilders for faster results, and were being transported to districts like Meerut, Baghpat and Muzaffarnagar via Eastern Peripheral Expressway. While the cost of the consignment is yet to be ascertained, the samples have been sent to narcotics labs. Drugs inspector Vaibhav Babbar, who made the arrests after a tip-off, said, "The packaging of the drugs give an impression that they are imported ones but the arrested persons did not have any document pertaining to the consignment. They are likely to be adulterated or fake drugs. We have sent 13 samples for testing." Elaborating on these drugs, Meerut-based senior surgeon and andrologist Dr Sunil Jindal said, “Injections like Nandrolone Acetate, Eldervit Neuro, Eldervit Neurobion and Deca Durabolin are anabolic steroids which immediately and substantially increase muscle mass and athletic power. However, they are banned all over the world especially in the sports field. The presence of these substances can only be traced through urine examination. The abuse of these drugs, rampantly used in local gyms, also causes impotency and kidney ailments." Notably, there is a huge demand for protein supplements in western UP which provides ample opportunity for counterfeiters to rake in quick money. In November, a raid at a Muzaffarnagar-based factory and several shops in the area had led to the seizure of tonnes of fake protein supplements along with 1.5 lakh pieces of packaging materials with the names of prominent international brands. The seized “supplements” were actually a mix of banned drugs and steroids for stamina and bodybuilding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/huge-consignment-of-steroids-seized-from-baghpat/articleshow/82053933.cms||Sandeep Rai

Soon police were deployed as people started gathering outside the BJP office in Udhna. BJP leaders claimed that over the last three days they had distributed 5,000 remdesivir injections free to the needy. “The stock got over, hence the distribution was suspended. Some vials were distributed in Navsari as well,” said Harsh Sanghvi, BJP MLA from Majura seat in Surat. Meanwhile, state BJP president C R Paatil commenting on the allegation made by Congress said, “When today we are trying to save people our work should be appreciated and Congress should not threaten us.” On Monday, Congress leaders had called on Gujarat Governor Acharya Devvrat and demanded Paatil’s arrest for alleged illegal procurement and storage of the medicine, which is in high demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/bjps-remdesivir-distribution-drive-ends/articleshow/82054959.cms||---
---||Lucknow||UP CM Yogi Adityanath orders to rope in MBBS 4th, 5th year students for Covid duty||LUCKNOW: As several doctors and health workers have fallen prey to Covid-19 in the ongoing second wave, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday directed that MBBS students in the fourth and fifth years, whose examinations have been cancelled, should be put on duty in hospitals. Two more hospitals in Lucknow, Mayo and Hind, are being converted into dedicated Covid facilities. The chief minister said that both hospitals, along with Rama Hospital in Kanpur and United Hospital in Prayagraj should be taken over and converted to full Covid facilities. In Lucknow, which recorded 5,382 cases on Tuesday, the government is trying to increase Covid beds by at least 2,000 by converting Era, TS Mishra Hospital and Integrated Medical College into dedicated Covid facilities.  Another 300 beds are being increased in Balrampur Hospital of which 215 will have facilities for oxygen and 40 will have ventilators. In the Cancer Hospital, which is also being converted to a dedicated Covid hospital, 50 out of 300 beds will be ICU beds. A nodal officer will be appointed for each of the hospitals so that they can coordinate between agencies concerned to ensure that adequate facilities are available. The CM said that if any private institute, hospital, laboratory etc is not cooperating with the government, strict action should be taken against them. Directing officials to focus on ‘test, trace and treat’, the CM said that special attention must be paid to the four districts of Lucknow, Kanpur Nagar, Varanasi and Prayagraj which on Tuesday accounted for 54% of the total fresh cases in the state. The total active cases in these four districts till Tuesday were 52,734, which is 55% of the state’s total active cases. He also asked health officials to scale up the number of RT-PCR tests to 1.5 lakh from the present 1 lakh out of 2 lakh plus tests being conducted daily. The government on Thursday started BSL level-2 labs in 12 more districts. The CM said that beds in all level 2 and 3 hospitals in all districts have to be increased while ensuring that there is no shortage of oxygen. He has directed the chief secretary, additional chief secretary (health) and principal secretary (medical education) to regularly review the situation of Covid hospitals and ensure that there are adequate supplies there. Focussing on increasing contact tracing, the CM said that vigilance committees should work effectively for this. Integrated command and control centres should be active and each district should reserve 50% of total ambulances available for Covid patients. “Navratri has started from Tuesday while Ramzan is to begin on Wednesday. The four phase panchayat elections are starting from April 15. In the following week, we will be celebrating ashtami and Ram Navami. Keeping these in mind, ensure that Covid protocols are followed strictly,” the CM said. He further directed all ministers in charge of districts to follow up with nodal officers and ensure that there was no shortage of any health facility in their areas. They should also ensure regular sanitisation, fogging etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-orders-to-rope-in-mbbs-4th-5th-year-students-for-covid-duty/articleshow/82056949.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Pune||Oxygen concentrators can be deployed at smaller care hubs: Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope||PUNE: Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope has now proposed the use of oxygen concentrators to ease shortage of medical oxygen in state hospitals. Oxygen concentrators draw in room air and pass it through filters that remove dust, bacteria and other particulates. They then deliver this supplementary oxygen to patients experiencing breathing trouble. While liquid oxygen tanks will be installed at state hospitals with 50 to 100 beds, these machines — generating purified oxygen from the air — are being considered for procurement for small hospitals via District Planning and Development Funds (DPDC), Tope said on Tuesday. “All districts are allowed to use 30% of their funds for Covid control. So administrations can decide if they want to use these machines,” the minister said. He said the machines will be first used in Jalna. “A 6x5 machine can purify oxygen from the air and supply it to a large number of patients, and there are several options. We are thinking of procuring these machines,” Tope said. The state currently manufactures 1,250 MT of oxygen, but if its daily consumption crosses 900 or 1,000 MT, it could spark worry. Many hospitals are reporting oxygen shortages. Tope said neighbouring Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh are not willing to supply Maharashtra with liquid oxygen. “Solutions have to be found,” he said. ‘Funding needed for crematoriums’ Health minister Rajesh Tope suggested the state government needs to provide funds for the installation of gas and electric crematoriums across all its districts. He said this is to avoid delays in the cremation of those who’ve died of Covid. “Funds for the units will be made available to all civic bodies via the Maharashtra Nagarothhan Yojana, state public health department, disaster response fund and the District Planning and Development Scheme,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tope-o2-concentrators-can-be-deployed-at-smaller-care-hubs/articleshow/82056153.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Complaints pour in against swab collection delay by labs||MUMBAI: While over 40,000 Covid diagnostic tests are conducted in Mumbai daily, there are increasing complaints about an almost 48-hour gap between booking an appointment and collection of samples. A 40-year-old Borivli resident who needed to undergo a Covid-19 test was shocked to hear that his swab sample would be collected after 48 hours. “I called up four laboratories, including the big chains, but they all told me that the state government has asked them not to collect samples for a few days,” he said. In Mulund, a 28-year-old researcher got a booking for Thursday, when she called up on Monday. “While I managed to book an online appointment with a well-known laboratory chain for Tuesday, my friend told me that the lab’s technicians don’t show up and don’t even communicate about any cancellation,” she said. BMC officials denied any order to not collect samples. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that many laboratories have increased their collection centres. “These collection centres have mushroomed and they take on too may samples, resulting in a delay in getting results,” he said. As the BMC has asked laboratories to give results within 24 hours of collecting the sample, he said laboratories are perhaps streamlining their collection. “But it shouldn’t take 48 hours to get an appointment,” said Kakani. “Most of our laboratories still offer walk-in facilities, but people from better economic backgrounds don’t come to our centres,” he added. When asked about the delay in sample collection, an official spokesperson for Metropolis Laboratory said, “Due to the rapid surge in the current cases, the industry is overburdened. Metropolis is adhering to BMC guidelines and picking samples based on our capacity so that we are able to adhere to the 24-hour TAT period.” The spokesperson added that negative reports are delivered within 24 hours and positive reports are released as per protocol. Queries to SRL Laboratories went unanswered. When asked about the delay, public health minister Rajesh Tope said the state has got proposals from multinational companies to set up RT-PCR facilities that can conduct 10,000 tests in a day. “The cost of the test would be Rs 350 per sample, but we would have no installation charges except to bear the electricity and space,” he said. “Such a facility could be of help in Mumbai.” The state is considering the proposal for such a centre in BMC-run Sion Hospital or state-run JJ Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-complaints-pour-in-against-swab-collection-delay-by-labs/articleshow/82056962.cms||---

Following a court order, the civic body was supposed to spend Rs 60 lakh to develop stalls at the market, but they did no such thing, Bharadwaj alleged. At a press conference, Bharadwaj demanded that the corporation should set up the stalls immediately. AAP councillors went to the area on Monday, during which local shopkeepers complained of lack of roads and toilets. “We also want the civic body to build these facilities,” said Bharadwaj. Bharadwaj also hit out at BJP for not withdrawing a tender that East Delhi Municipal Corporation allegedly “gave to a blacklisted company”. AAP on Monday claimed that EDMC has issued a tender to a blacklisted security agency and demanded its withdrawal. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that EDMC has not given any contract to a blacklisted company and the company which has been given the security contract was never blacklisted.

---||Hyderabad||Saidabad murder: Police take suspects in custody||Hyderabad: A day after a 45-year-old woman, Manjula Kanodia, was stabbed to death by alleged loan sharks at her home at Lokayukta Colony, Saidabad police along with Task Force sleuths reportedly picked up some suspects on Tuesday. They also launched a manhunt to nab the remaining suspects. Police said the prime suspects gave Rs 27 lakh loan to Manjula’s husband Parimal and as he started avoiding them for the past one year, they went to confront his wife and in a fit of rage, one of them stabbed her to death. Around 9pm, four to five men went to the flat of the victim, Manjula, employee of a real estate firm, and picked up an argument with her while asking about the whereabouts of Parimal. “As the men started arguing with her aloud, she took them out of the building on to the street to discuss the matter. While arguing with Manjula, one of the men stabbed her and she collapsed on the road,” joint commissioner, East Zone, M Ramesh said. A pouch of the knife was found at the crime scene. Alerted by locals, police rushed to the spot and 108 ambulance staff, who reached there, declared her dead. During the preliminary probe, police identified the suspects as Imran, a cloth merchant from Karwan, and his associates. According to police, Imran’s mother Mehraj Begum and their relative, Khaisar, gave Rs 27 lakh to Parimal in 2019 as investment in his medical business. After borrowing the money, Parimal had only provided returns for a few months and later started avoiding them. “It came to notice that Parimal borrowed money from several people and duped them. In June, 2020, he moved his wife and two children to the house in Saidabad. He stayed with them only for over a week and later he was not seen by neighbours. Even his children said they have not seen him,” Saidabad inspector K Srinivas said. Parimal’s father Dinesh Kanodia of Boggulakunta told police that he has not met his son in several months. Manjula’s brother’s relative Dinesh Kumar said Parimal had even borrowed money from his brother-in-law and did not return. “Manjula was killed because of the mistakes of her husband. We feel sad for her children,” Dinesh Kumar said. Police reportedly picked up some of the suspects on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/saidabad-murder-police-take-suspects-in-custody/articleshow/82055296.cms||---

It has predicted that the states in north India, including Delhi, may face “around 10-15% rain deficit” this monsoon, but the city is likely to receive good rain in September. Meanwhile, Tuesday was the warmest day of the year as the maximum temperature was recorded at 40.2 degrees Celsius, four degrees above normal, at Safdarjung observatory, Delhi’s base station. “There will be an overall marginal deficit of about 10-15%. However, September will be much better as the withdrawal of monsoon is expected to be delayed this year. The rain activity will continue till the end of September or till October,” said Mahesh Palawat of Skymet Weather. “There are chances of marginal deficit but won’t be significant in Delhi, Punjab and Haryana.” In 2020, the monsoon withdrew from Delhi on September 30 with an overall 20% deficit. The usual date is September 21. Skymet Weather said the monsoon was expected to arrive by June-end — normal date June 27 — but the pre-monsoon activity would intensify in June. The activity of dust storm may continue till May. On Tuesday, Sports Complex was the hottest station at 42.1 degrees Celsius, followed by Narela at 41.6. The minimum temperature was 19.8 degrees Celsius, one degree below normal, at Safdarjung. The maximum temperature is likely to remain 40 degrees Celsius on Wednesday and Thursday. However, the Met department has predicted that the day temperature may dip to 36-37 degrees on the weekend due to very light to light rain along with thunderstorm and dust storm on Friday night and Saturday morning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/10-15-deficit-likely-in-delhi-but-sept-may-see-good-rain/articleshow/82056161.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Based on a complaint lodged by the victims, Vanasthalipuram police registered a cheating case. A complaint was received from T Srinivasa Rao, 37, a private employee from Arunodaya Colony in Vanasthalipuram by the police.

Rresidents complained that the garbage is not being lifted on time, resulting in frequent fires in the area. Meanwhile, a major fire broke out at a garment store at Dewan Devdi in Old City. Though no casualties were reported, officials said property worth lakhs of rupees was gutted. It is suspected that the fire may have been caused due to a short-circuit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fire-breaks-out-at-garbage-dump-near-charminar-bus-stand/articleshow/82055303.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Shyam Pratapwar, assistant commissioner (drug), FDA, said, “Introducing an additional helpline number is under consideration. It will become operational soon.” On Tuesday, Pune district received just 3,797 vials of the drug as against the daily requirement of up to 14,000 vials. On Monday, the district had received 6,300 vials. Manjari resident Supriya Shinde said, “My husband, father-law and sister-in-law are currently on oxygen support at Tarachand hospital in Rasta Peth and Hope hospital in Nana Peth. They need the drug urgently.” Shinde had tried the helpline number at the district collector’s control room but could not get through. “The number is constantly busy,” she complained. When asked about the low allocation of the drug, Pratapwar said, “The Union government stopped the export of the drug to other countries two days ago. Those consignments will now be made available to all states, including Maharashtra. It is a matter of two to three days now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/more-helpline-numbers-demanded-for-remdesivir/articleshow/82056156.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Vote in a united way? I still want people to vote in a united way,” she told the crowd at Barasat 15 minutes after the ban ended. The CM was alluding to statements made by her during campaigning on April 4, where she had appealed to her “minority brothers and sisters with folded hands... do not let minority votes be divided”. The unprecedented EC ban came after this statement, and a subsequent one urging people to “gherao CRPF personnel if they foment trouble”, made two days later in Cooch Behar. “I am a street fighter and I fight the battle from the battlefield,” Banerjee said, reminding everyone that she couldn’t be confined to her home. Arguing that the 72-hour silence phase for the fifth phase of the assembly polls on Saturday (for all political parties) and the 24-hour ban meant she could not campaign for “four days”, she alleged that there was a concerted, all-out effort to stop her under the “pretext” of an election. “From the heavyweights to the minnows in BJP, the government of India, all its agencies are (working) together to finish me. There is an unholy effort to insult Bengal, to capture Bengal. But I will never let Bengal be Gujarat,” she said. “But they cannot defeat me,” she added. Attacking PM Narendra Modi, she said: “Every election day, he will launch a campaign (in Bengal). He is the PM, not just any politician. People can be misled. I want to draw the EC’s attention to it. If he stops, I will also not campaign.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/west-bengal-elections-just-as-ban-ends-mamata-banerjee-says-vote-unitedly/articleshow/82058059.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Jaipur||Rajput bodies slam Kataria for using inappropriate words for Maharana||Jaipur/Udaipur: Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria has courted a major controversy by using inappropriate words for the ruler of Mewar Maharana Pratap (1540-1597) in an election campaign rally at Rajsamand on Monday. Kataria, while explaining the contribution of Pratap in protecting the religion and culture from foreign invaders, said, “Yeah Maharana Pratap abhi gay na, kya isko pagal kutte ne kata tha jo apne Rajdhani chod karke pahadi ke dongar par rota raha (This Maharana Pratap has just gone (period), was he bitten by a mad dog so he had left his capital taking refuge from one hill to the another crying).” The statement soon went viral on social media after which Rajput and other organisations demanded an unconditional apology. Kataria was quick to apologise by uploading a video on his Facebook account but it did little help as protesting organisations continue to protest against him. In a 1.14 video, Kataria said that the context and words used for Shiromani Maharana Pratap were inappropriate. “I have apologised in that campaign rally soon after I realised that the selection of my words was not right. I am sorry for hurting the sentiments of people,” said Kataria in a video. Congress was quick to jump on the issue in the election season at three assembly segments on April 17. Transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariywas, while campaigning in Rajsamand, refused to accept the apology by the former home minister on behalf of Rajput and other organisations, who have opened a front against him. “The words used by Kataria for the tallest icon for Indians is unpardonable. I urge those who respect and love Maharana Pratap to stand together in defeating BJP candidate in Mewar (Rajsamand is part of Mewar),” said Khachriyawas. Mahendra Singh Medtiya, joint secretary of Mewar Kshatriya Mahasabha, a body of Rajputs in the Udaipur division has submitted a memorandum to the governor and chief minister Ashok Gehlot seeking a ban on Kataria for appearing on public forums. “Kataria has lost everything he has earned in his political career. His act is no less than a criminal offence and he should be booked immediately,” said Medtiya. In Jaipur, Karni Sena Youths have defaced poster of Kataria outside the BJP office earlier in the day. The body has threatened to held protest wherever he visits in the state. Narain Singh Divrala, president of Karni Sena, Jaipur Unit, says, “All our units will proceed to Rajsamand on April 15 to mobilise voters to cast their vote to any candidate other than BJP ones. This is the price BJP has to pay for the sin committed by Kataria.” Members of the Rajput community inked Kataria’s posters outside Udaipur Collectorate on Tuesday morning while at Gogunda and Chawand people burnt his effigies and staged protests on the main roads. At Udaipur, a horse symbolising Chetak was brought and made to trample Kataria’s posters under its feet. At Rajsamand, members of the Jai Rajputana Sangh appealed to the people that those who would vote for the BJP should stop worshipping Maharana Pratap. Bhanwar SIngh Rehta, the founder of the association said Kataria’s comments were a part of well-planned propaganda.” One month ago in a function at VallabhNagar, the BJP chief Satish Punia insulted Maharana Pratap by placing Pratap’s memento near his feet. Rajputs thought the act was unintentional but now, a senior leader like Kataria uses derogatory words for him which is unforgivable” Rehta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rajput-bodies-slam-kataria-for-using-inappropriate-words-for-maharana/articleshow/82055313.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

We are going to stage a protest against this issue as the government must think about teachers who are already dealing with pandemic.”Another issue that schools are facing right now is the issue of money from the government under Right to Education in which students from economically backward study in private schools.

Sunni Waqf Board’s counsel Puneet Gupta filed the plea, a day after Anjuman Intezamia of Gyanvapi Masjid moved a similar petition in high court, challenging the trial court’s order to conduct a survey of the Kashi Vishwanath-Gyanvapi complex by Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). Talking to TOI, chairman of Sunni Waqf Board Zufar Farooqui said, “We have moved high court as the civil court’s order is a violation of The Places of Worship Act, 1991, which is included in the fundamental structure of the Constitution and was endorsed by Supreme Court in its landmark Ayodhya verdict. Now, the status of Gyanvapi Masjid cannot be questioned. No evidence has been produced before the Varanasi lower court that suggests the presence of a temple at the mosque site. The ASI excavation of the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri masjid site too could not conclusively prove the mosque was built after razing a temple and this was specifically mentioned in Supreme Court’s Ayodhya judgment. This practice of ‘investigating’ mosques by ASI must be stopped.” Monday’s petition filed in high court by Anjuman Intezamia of Gyanvapi Masjid stated that “it appears the learned civil judge is more interested in bypassing judicial disciplines, ethics and procedures of law and to establish himself as above the judicial hierarchy as defined under Civil Procedure Code and assumed himself as the only authority to decide the issue without looking into the legal impediment and bar.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/asi-survey-sunni-board-moves-hc/articleshow/82056955.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

The incident occurred during the morning safari in Bakola forest region. The driver ferrying wildlife photographers allegedly went off route and parked the gypsy to capture shot of tiger T-112 and tigress T-03. After a complaint, the forest department immediately swung into action and banned the entry of the driver and the nature guide till next order. The entry of wildlife photographers were also banned. DFO Ranthambore Mahendra Sharma said, “The matter was brought to my notice. It was revealed in the investigation that wildlife norms were violated. We have asked for explanation and banned the entry of vehicle driver, guide and photographers until next order.” Ideally, a vehicle should maintain a distance of at least 50 metres from any wild animal. Source said as the photographers had permission of chief wildlife warden, they presumed they could drive off route too to shoot the big cats. One person was also standing in the gypsy while shooting the tiger. The animal should be captured without disturbance. “The other tourists who were following norms also faced inconvenience cause of the violators,” said the source. A senior forest official source said, “Many tourists travelling to forests in India are a threat to wildlife and ecosystem as they are “irresponsible”. They do not want to return disappointed, so they pay to lure guides and gypsy drivers to help them in getting the perfect picture,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/entry-of-lensmen-driver-and-nature-guide-banned-in-rbore/articleshow/82056163.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘Allow coaching classes to open for e-lectures & admissions’||MUMBAI: Coaching classes have requested the government to allow them to stay open for online lectures and students’ admissions, and resume offline classes after the lockdown-like restrictions were lifted. But the government directives issued on Tuesday for the stringent restrictions in the state for 15 days starting Wednesday night stated that coaching classes won't open for now. The Maharashtra Class Owners’ Association said its members have suffered immense financial losses since the first lockdown in March 2020 and would not be able to sustain another one. “It is now one year since coaching classes are shut due to the pandemic. Most municipalities did not allow us to reopen even briefly...We have constantly followed up with the school and higher education department, but to no avail,” said the association in a statement. Only a few distr-icts had briefly allowed coaching classes to start offline lectures. There are over 98,000 coaching class owners who employ 30 lakh people in the state. “Balance fee collection, student enrolments and other revenue generating avenues have dried up, but our overheads like commercial rent, salaries and electricity bills continue to pile up... The mismatch in revenue-liability is overwhelming.... Many of us are forced to shut operations,” said Santosh Vaskar, president of the association. “In competition are big companies working in the digital learning space. If we do not remain open during the admission season, a lot of students will move to these companies that spend a lot on technology and marketing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-allow-coaching-classes-to-open-for-e-lectures-admissions/articleshow/82056958.cms||Vinamrata Borwankar
---||Goa||Goa: Covid positivity rate at 22% with 562 new cases||PANAJI: With 562 new infections reported on Tuesday, Goa’s tally of active Covid-19 cases rose to 4,887. The positivity rate was at 22% and the death toll increased by three to 854. Two men—an 89-year-old from Sawantwadi and a 91-year-old from Tivim —and a 57-year-old woman from Canca, died at Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital.  While all three had comorbidities, the woman suffered hypertension and died within a week of hospitalisation. At the time of hospitalisation, she had acute respiratory distress syndrome indicating a delayed diagnosis leading to late treatment. GMC dean and in-charge of Covid hospitals Dr S M Bandekar has appealed to people not to defer testing even if they exhibit slightest symptoms of the virus, as of late, they have seen a lot of patients reporting late for treatment. On Tuesday, Margao’s caseload increased to 523 with an addition of over 50 cases. Along with Porvorim, Margao has seen expeditious growth over the last 10 days. Porvorim’s case tally dropped marginally to 460 as recoveries were higher than new cases reported on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Ponda’s caseload went up to 369 which has seen a spurt in highly populated pockets of the town. Also, Ponda has been home to industrial workers employed in Kundaim industrial estate and even Verna industrial estates. Bicholim, Sakhali and Pernem saw their numbers rising and each had over a 100 cases. Vasco and Cortalim together had over 500 active cases. Though the jump in cases in both towns has not been as fast as witnessed in either Porvorim or Margao, the health authorities are worried nonetheless, because they are thickly populated. Siolim and Chimbel had more than 150 cases each. While 236 patients were cured over the last 24 hours, the recovery rate was 91%, six points less than last month. During the day, 307 patients were home isolated and 97 were hospitalised. Since the rapid rise in cases, the number of hospitalisations has increased in the last one week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/states-covid-positivity-rate-at-22-with-562-new-cases/articleshow/82056188.cms||---
---||Delhi||Imams urge people to avoid assembling in large numbers||New Delhi: As the Ramzan moon was sighted on Tuesday night, imams of prominent mosques in the city have asked devotees to avoid assembling at mosques in large numbers, to not attend iftar parties and to maintain social distancing. Mufti Mukarram of Chandni Chowk’s Fatehpuri Masjid told TOI: “Unlike last year where we had total lockdown, people can celebrate Ramzan this year. But cases right now are more than ever before so it is better to avoid assembling in large numbers.” For the special prayer of Taraweeh during Ramzan, when the whole Quran is read out and different mosques see a huge assembly, the imam said: “It is not mandatory and people can pray it at home. I would suggest that people spend time at home and avoid stepping out much in the wake of the rising Covid-19 cases. They should also avoid thronging the markets.” The Nizamuddin Dargah has decided to shut down the mausoleum by 9 pm. “We have decided that people should leave before the curfew begins. We have asked our volunteers to make sure that people don’t sit at the dargah for long and leave after they are done with their prayers,” said dargah spokesperson Altamash Nizami. “We will provide langars to people during the month and we will also distribute food boxes while following all SOPs,” he added. Imam Bukhari of Jama Masjid said that “Taraweeh prayers will be limited at the mosque and steps have been taken to ensure that.” The Mughal-era mosque usually witnesses hundreds of families assembling at this courtyard every year for a communal iftar where they all break fast together. “This time, we have asked people to avoid coming to the mosque for the communal iftar event. We will also distribute food to people outside the mosque,” said Bukhari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/imams-urge-people-to-avoid-assembling-in-large-numbers/articleshow/82056181.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Hyderabad||Ali versus Ali: TRS, Congress go all out to woo Muslim voters||HYDERABAD: The TRS and Congress are vying with each other to woo Muslim minorities in Nagarjuna Sagar assembly constituency which will go to bypolls on April 17. While chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has deputed home minister Mohammed Mahmood Ali to win the hearts of the minority voters, former minister Mohammed Ali Shabbir is spearheading the campaign for Congress in Muslim areas of the constituency. There are nearly 10,000 Muslim voters in the constituency and both the parties are banking on the senior Muslim leaders to do the magic. Mahmood Ali tells the voters about the welfare schemes being implemented by the TRS government and that the Congress has treated them only as a vote-bank. On his part, Shabbir Ali tries to convince the Muslims that Congress is still the best bet for them as the TRS has failed on all its promises to the principle minority community including the enhancement of reservations from 4 per cent given by Congress government to 12 per cent. He also rakes up the demolition of two mosques in the secretariat during his campaign. Mahmood Ali seeks to assure the Muslim community that KCR, who is offering Shaadi Mubarak and overseas scholarship schemes and established minority residential schools, will resolve all their problems too. “The progress and development achieved by Muslims under the TRS government cannot be matched by any state in the country,” he says. Shabbir Ali told TOI that a majority of the community elders, ulema, imams of various mosques and heads of religious institutions having considerable influence over the community have already extended their support to Congress. “They trust Jana Reddy who stood behind them in every issue in the last five decades,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ali-versus-ali-trs-cong-go-all-out-to-woo-muslim-voters/articleshow/82055318.cms||Roushan Ali

The state board has given an option to call students to the nearest open ground and conduct the physical education test and if that is not possible due to Covid restrictions then the exam must be conducted online.For teachers , it is added work to conductthe test online. Many said in rural areas they will run into handset , internet connectivity and availability problems.Others said physical exercises need to be observed in person , and the students graded accordingly. Online tests may not give a correct picture leading to unfair marking .The general consensus was that the state board must look at keeping the grading to only theory this year given the unprecendented situation.Parents and students have opposed the decision and said that not a single class was conducted during the year then on what basis would the exam be conducted. School teachers have been requesting the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education to release the guidelines for conducting the assessment of ‘health and physical education’ subject which is for 50 marks and converted to grades. The state board chairman, Dinkar Patil, said, “Schools should send the mark list of the students after assessment to their respective divisional boards up to June 10. Where it is possible, especially in rural areas, school teachers can conduct the assessment in small batches in a nearby ground. Students should be asked to carry their own skipping rope and yoga mat. They should avoid using each other’s things. Where this is not possible, a one-on-one virtual meet can be arranged by school teachers and assessments can be conducted.”School teachers insisted that the entire year there have been no sessions for this subject so it was not appropriate to assess the students for any of the physical education activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/schools-in-a-jam-after-board-orders-pt-test-online-or-in-playgrounds/articleshow/82056175.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The boyfriend told police that they had an argument following which she locked herself in a room and ended her life. The girl’s family, however, alleged that she was murdered by her boyfriend. Police have, meanwhile, detained the boyfriend for questioning. Budaun SSP Sankalp Sharma said, “The circumstantial evidence suggests the girl committed suicide because of her boyfriend. We have booked him for abetment of suicide. The autopsy report has ascertained the reason for her death as hanging.” On Monday, after receiving a call from a local that a girl was found hanging in a house, circle officer Baldev Singh Khaneda and local SHO rushed to the spot. Police broke open the door of the room locked from inside and took custody of the body, while forensic experts gathered evidence. The boyfriend told police that the girl had an argument with him as she wanted to marry at the earliest and he wanted some time. The SSP told TOI, “The girl and her boyfriend belonged to the same community and several people were aware of their affair. The autopsy report didn’t find any evidence of use of force for hanging or sexual assault. However, circumstantial evidence suggests the girl killed herself after an argument with the youth. We have booked him under section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code. We have detained him for questioning.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/girl-18-found-hanging-from-ceiling-fan-at-her-boyfriends-house/articleshow/82053384.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Lucknow||UP: Girl, 15, strangles minor brother for objecting to chat||LUCKNOW: A 15-year-old girl strangled her brother (9) using her earphone cable and dumped his body in the storeroom of her house in Rae Bareli allegedly after he objected to her long chat with a friend on phone. The murder came to light late on Monday evening and accused was sent to the juvenile home on Tuesday.  Police said the girl used to spend hours talking to a boy on the phone when the parents were not around. A few days ago, her minor brother told their parents about it.  They, in turn, reprimanded the girl. According to police, on Thursday, when their parents were not home, the girl again started talking to her friend. "The boy spotted his sister talking over the phone and objected to it. It led to a scuffle between the two following which he attacked the girl, but she strangled him using earphone wire," said Rae Bareli Shlok Kumar. The SP told TOI that on Thursday night, Dalmau police station of the district received information about a missing nine-year-old boy and instantly launched a manhunt. “Next day, a foul smell started emanating and the parents of the girl opened the storeroom of the house to find the body of their son. After this, the victim’s father lodged a named FIR against a neighbour who was also detained by the police,” said Kumar. Brother complained to parents against meHowever, during interrogation and surveillance, it surfaced that the man rounded up was not near the spot of crime which was also corroborated by physical evidence. Thereafter, all members present on the day were interrogated. "Also family members were examined as abrasions, cuts and wounds on the body of the boy proved that scuffle would have taken place between the deceased and the attacker," said the SP. “A medical and forensic team was asked to collect samples and conduct examinations of those present on the fateful day. Samples of as many as 25 persons were taken and only his elder sister had bruises on her stomach, neck, hands,” said the officer. Later, in front of parents and the child welfare officer, the girl was questioned and she confessed to her crime. "She also said that she didn't want to kill her brother, but he used to complain to parents against her when she would talk to a male friend," added the SP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/girl-15-strangles-minor-bro-for-objecting-to-chat/articleshow/82056964.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Curbs hit study circles for poor students||Mumbai: When the city and its schools shut down in March last year, 18-year-old Usman Khan had to take up a job to make ends meet. His education took a back seat in what was supposed to be a crucial academic year for him – class X. Like Usman, scores of students from the economically weaker sections have been left behind. Many of them are now awaiting board examinations feeling significantly underprepared. Gigabytes of tutorial videos, worksheets and exercises generated amidst the shift in focus to digital learning means little to them. Usman studies at the Mohili Village Mumbai Public School (MPS) in Saki Naka. “I don’t feel ready for the board exams. My father lost his job during the lockdown, so I had to take up one. I had a mobile phone, but I was loading and unloading packages for 12 hours a day,” he said. Usman returned to the city from Nashik in December 2020 but continues to work at a pharmacy. His classmate Avinash Sharma too had limited access to digital learning for most part of the year. Their school had begun small study circles to help cope with learning loss but with more restrictions in place due to the resurgence of Covid-19, students are once again forced to rely entirely on digital access to their teachers. “Most of my students did not have a phone for the initial 3-4 months. We crowdfunded and procured personal devices for all our students but that by itself did not improve attendance for our online classes. Poor internet, electricity cuts, migration and child labour persisted till the end of the year,” said Usman’s teacher and Teach for India fellow, Rohan Rajapure. Reports estimate that continuous access to digital learning in the state was available to as little as 27% of school students. In Mumbai, the situation looks better with a survey showing approximately 90% of about 6.2 lakh in both public and private institutions had uninterrupted internet linkage. On the flip side though, 60,000 students in the metropolis remained disconnected from digital lessons. One of them, Santosh Bhagoji, a class X student from BMC’s MPS in Vile Parle, was without a mobile phone for nearly four months. “I damaged my mobile phone and didn’t have access for learning until my school sourced one for me a few months later. Most of my learning happened over the past few months when I came to school and studied with my teachers,” he said. Santosh like many others wants the government to further truncate the SSC syllabus and postpone exams to give them more time to prepare. Teachers across the city are struggling to prepare students with limited or no digital access for the upcoming boards this year. Santosh’s teacher Suresh Abhale and other staff at the school collected funds to provide mobiles to 35 of its 150 students. “A lot of students have mobile phones but no access to data. Or there is one phone in the household which the parent carries to work and isn’t available for the kids. So, we created a lot of content that could be used asynchronously but the learning was largely impacted since students couldn’t clear doubts. We sent home worksheets and exercise books. Over the last few months, we called them in small groups to study,” said Abhale. The fresh wave has, however, disrupted study groups and students are back to learning from home. The BMC has now asked its schools to distribute answer sheets and allow students to write their prelims at home in preparation for the board exams that begin later this month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-curbs-hit-study-circles-for-poor-students/articleshow/82056971.cms||Vinamrata Borwankar

A bench of Justice Birendra Kumar observed that evidences brought during the trial did not establish any offence by the accused. It is a case of no evidence, the court observed and ordered that the trial court judgment along with its order of setting aside the verdict be sent to the Bihar Judicial Academy to ensure proper academic training of judicial officers. The bench allowed the appeal of Deepak Mahto, who had challenged his conviction by the Pocso court at Bettiah in West Champaran on June 15, 2019. The high court simultaneously allowed Mahto to be set free at once. The order was passed on Monday evening. The bench observed that the Chief Justice may deem it proper for the trial judge, who passed the judgment, to undergo special training at the academy. A 13-year-old girl, in an FIR lodged with Inarwa police station in West Champaran on June 17, 2018, accused Mahto of raping her. However, in her statement recorded before a judicial magistrate under Section 164 CrPC, she alleged that Mahto attempted to rape her but could not succeed. The police submitted a chargesheet against the accused for an attempt to rape the girl. Mahto was sentenced to 10-year RI with Rs 2 lakh fine on June 14, 2019. The court ordered him to pay Rs 1 lakh of the amount to the victim. The high court observed that the trial court accepted the conflicting facts in the FIR and the statement recorded under Section 164, but could not appreciate the lack of any substantive evidence. The HC also pulled up the trial court judge for referring to shlokas and ghazals of late Jagjit Singh in his judgement. The bench observed that a trial judge, especially having the power to award death sentence, must have correct knowledge of legal principles and zeal to its proper application while exercising the most onerous responsibility of taking decision on the life and liberty of a person before him. “Lack of knowledge of legal principles leads to miscarriage of justice and unnecessary harassment to the parties to the litigation. Bias and prejudices, conjectures and surmises and personal views contrary to the material on the record have no place in the court of law,” the HC observed. Senior advocate NK Agrawal, assisted by Vijay Anand, appeared for Mahto while additional public prosecutor Zeyaul Hoda represented the state government. During the trial, the victim deposed before the court that she would not be able to recognise the boy (Mahto) if he was brought before her. Contrary to the FIR in which the girl said her family members had caught the accused, she told the trial court that her family members were not at home and, in fact, the villagers had caught Mahto. The high court observed that the victim did not specify the kind of offence committed against her. It also observed that the girl’s mother, another prosecution witness, stated that she was asleep and the accused had already fled when she woke up. “The witness (mother) is also not specific what the girl told her about the incident,” the HC observed. The girl’s brother and father’s sister were declared hostile by the prosecution. The HC observed that the two doctors who had medically examined the girl and performed radiological examination respectively were not produced before the trial court and their reports as exhibits were not substantive evidence unless they supported their findings in the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/angry-with-trial-court-verdict-hc-wants-special-training-for-judge/articleshow/82055025.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Patna: Covid patients scramble as hospitals run out of beds||PATNA: As beds in the Covid wards of most government and private hospitals here are filled to capacity, patients reaching the city from different districts have to move from one hospital to another in hope of getting treatment. However, Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) had 29 Covid beds lying unoccupied by Tuesday. “Of the 112 beds in the Covid ward at PMCH, 83 are occupied,” hospital superintendent Dr IS Thakur said. He said there was little scope to further increase Covid beds as non-Covid patients are also making a beeline for the hospital from across the state. As the 110 beds in Covid ward of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P) are fully occupied, the hospital has proposed to arrange additional beds for the Covid patients. “At least 30 more beds will become functional from Wednesday,” said AIIMS-P nodal officer for Covid Dr Sanjeev Kumar. He added at least 70 ambulances carrying Covid patients had to return from AIIMS-P on Tuesday due to non-availability of beds. All the 95 beds at Ruban Hospital are full having no scope for fresh admissions, said hospital’s managing director Dr Satyajeet Singh. He added at least 10 Covid patients were awaiting admission at the hospital. “The new patients will be admitted only after some old ones are discharged,” Dr Singh said. At Paras HMRI Hospital too, all the 48 beds are full. Several ambulances were seen returning with patients after getting no bed at the hospital on Tuesday. Regional director of the hospital Dr Talat Halim said the waiting list was getting longer. “The 55-bed Covid ward of Ford Hospital is fully occupied by patients,” said Pradeep Sharma, the quality manager of the hospital. He added the RT-PCR test reports of some admitted patients came negative, but their symptoms and other examinations indicated Covid infection. The 28-bed Covid ward at Jagadish Memorial Hospital is also full, said hospital’s administrator Arpana Minakshi. She added at least 25 Covid patients are being refused admission at the hospital per day owing to shortage of beds. However, at a little distance from the city, all the 30 Covid beds at Netaji Subhash Medical College at Amhara near Bihta are lying vacant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-patients-scramble-as-hospitals-run-out-of-beds/articleshow/82054343.cms||VK Tripathi

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Info panel fines officials for violation of RTI Act||JAIPUR: The State Information Commission, while expressing its displeasure over the attitude of Ajmer Municipal Corporation which took a long time to respond to a citizen’s request seeking information under the Right to Information Act, imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on the corporation commissioner. In another case, the commission imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 on the executive officer of Bhawani Mandi Municipality for ignoring the Right to Information Act. This fine will be deducted from his salary. Hearing the matter, information commissioner Narayan Bareth said the corporation had made inordinate delay in replying to the RTI query. In this case, Nathu Singh of Ajmer had filed an application on May 30, 2018 asking the corporation for information on action taken on his grievance. According to the applicant, on April 19, 2018, the district collector sent a letter to the corporation asking for a copy of the proceedings, remarks and note-sheet. But the corporation did not pay any heed to Singh's plea. According to the applicant, when the corporation did not provide any information within the stipulated time, Singh filed an appeal to mayor under the Right to Information Act. After a hearing on September 17, 2018, the mayor ordered the corporation to provide information within 15 days. But the corporation administration also did not give any importance to the order of the mayor. When the commission sought its response to the corporation on the appeal of Nathu Singh, the corporation kept refraining from answering. The commission sent notices to the corporation four times but the civic officials did not pay any heed to it. The commission also imposed a fine of Rs 5000 on the executive officer of Bhawani Mandi municipality in Jhalawar district. Anwar Hussain of Bhawani Mandi had complained that he had filed an application on July 10, 2010, asking the municipality for information about pattas issued under the State Grant Act. When the commission asked the municipality for an answer, the municipality did not respond. The commission gave an opportunity to the municipality twice. The information commissioner instructed the officer to get Hussain to inspect the records and provide information up to 50 pages free of cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/info-panel-fines-officials-for-violation-of-rti-act/articleshow/82056184.cms||---
---||Vadodara||As deaths in hospitals spike, stats become casualty in Gujarat: Big mismatch in official figures & those from hospitals||VADODARA/ AHMEDABAD/ RAJKOT: How many are dying of Covid-19 in Gujarat’s cities? One, two or maximum three in Vaododara, going by Covid-19 bulletin released by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) daily. Officially, less than 20 a day in Surat and less than 15 if Rajkot officials are to be believed. But TOI has learnt that the central Gujarat’s biggest hospital – SSG Hospital – in Vadodara alone has seen nearly 142 deaths in Covid intensive care units (ICUs) in the last seven days. In other words, the government hospital sees an average of 20 deaths a day in its ICUs. The number of deaths in Covid ICUs in GMERS Medical College and Hospital, Gotri, another major hospital in Vadodara, too is no less. Sources said the dome-structured Covid ICU itself has seen 90 deaths since April 7 while ICUs on fourth and fifth floors are seeing at least 15 mortalities a day. Together, the toll in these two Vadodara hospitals alone is more than 300 in a week, excluding deaths of Covid patients at private hospitals in the city and its periphery. In contrast, VMC’s bulletin reflects just 16 deaths since April 7 while the official toll since the onset of the pandemic that started last year stands at 272.  In fact, on Monday, SSG had recorded as many as 30 deaths in its Covid ICUs but the bulletin that the civic body declared reported just three across Vadodara. Nearly 23 of these patients had tested positive in RT-PCR tests, their clinical records state. VMC’s medical officer Dr Devesh Patel said, “Since the beginning of the pandemic, we are following a system of declaring deaths based on reports of audit committee. We declare them in Covid bulletins after the committee submits their reports to us based on clinical history of the patient and evidence available declares whether the patient actually died due to Covid-19 or not.” When asked about the huge mismatch between the figures reflected in the bulletin and deaths in ICUs, he said that it is possible as deaths are declared as and when reports arrive. In Ahmedabad, TOI visited five crematoriums in western city parts where 28 bodies were either being cremated with Covid protocols or were in queue for turn between 1pm and 5pm. The official toll on Tuesday was 23 but the figure doesn't count the morning and evening hours that records the highest cremations, which sources said was about 80-90 a day. While official figures are not available for Civil Hospital, the biggest tertiary care centre, the hospital alone records 50-odd deaths daily, said sources, adding that the mortalities in private hospitals and other government-run facilities are easily in the range of 100-120. "The ever-busy crematoriums are proof of the burden of Covid the city is experiencing," said a city-based doctor on condition of anonymity. Rajkot has seen 184 deaths in various government and private Covid hospitals from April 8 to April 12. Out of these, the death audit committees have declared 32 deaths, which it says, died ‘purely’ due to Covid. On Tuesday, another 59 people succumbed in the district.  “The government statistics may be different, but the reality is that, on an average, over 170 Covid-19 patients succumb to the virus and their final rites are being performed daily in the city,’‘ sources said.

---||Dehradun||Maha Kumbh: After over 100 pilgrims, 20 seers test +ve||HARIDWAR/DEHRADUN: In just one day, 102 pilgrims had tested positive for Covid-19 on the first Shahi Snan. Now, nearly 20 seers have as well. Yet, health officials said, the religious heads are not getting tested, refusing to wear masks and not following social distancing norms at the Maha Kumbh Mela in Haridwar. By the estimates of the Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad (ABAP), the presiding body of all akhadas, about one lakh seers were at the religious congregation on Monday for the Shahi Snan. “The seers have been asked to isolate themselves and stay away from devotees. But, as was evident during the Shahi Snan, Covid-19 rules are being flouted. We are trying to make them understand what the guidelines are but they don’t pay heed,” Haridwar chief medical officer Dr SK Jha told TOI. In the last 24 hours, he added, five seers from Juna Akhada, two from Niranjani Akhada, and one each from Nath and Agni akhadas have tested positive. “So far, 18 seers have been infected (in four days), including president of ABAP and head of Niranjani Akhada Narendra Giri,” the CMO added. Giri had to be moved to AIIMS Rishikesh after his health deteriorated. But it does not seem to have set any alarm bells ringing among the religious heads. On Tuesday, the eve of another Shahi Snan, the Mahamandleshwars (heads) of all 13 akhadas were seen camping in the Kumbh area with no social distancing. A senior health official at Haridwar said, “Leave aside testing, the seers are not even ready to wear masks. Some of us pleaded with folded hands, but they didn’t listen.” Mela officer Deepak Rawat said the holy dip is difficult to manage: “It’s practically not possible to ensure social distancing and mask-adherence during the Snans.” On Monday, Kumbh Mela IG Sanjay Gunjyal had, on similar lines, told TOI that implementing Covid-19 guidelines is “practically not possible”. The seers shot back with two arguments — that no one was coming to take their samples and that “posing hindrances” for devotees was a “violation of rights”. “We are ready for tests but no one is coming to take samples. Not a single seer has opposed tests or thermal screening. We are also asking our followers to adhere to Covid guidelines,” ABAP general secretary Hari Giri said. Swami Avimukteshwaranand, representative of Shankarachrayra Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati, said, “Is anyone asking for Covid tests at political rallies? Is anyone being asked to come with RT-PCR tests from 72 hours before there? … Posing hindrance for devotees in the name of Covid is a violation of fundamental and religious rights of Hindus.” The only respite, government officials managing the Mela said, is the relative success in places beyond the Snan sites. Rawat said, “In akhadas, markets and the town, guidelines are being followed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/maha-kumbh-after-over-100-pilgrims-20-seers-test-ve/articleshow/82055361.cms||Ishita Mishra

We declare them in Covid bulletins after the committee submits their reports to us based on clinical history of the patient and evidence available declares whether the patient actually died due to Covid-19 or not.” When asked about the huge mismatch between the figures reflected in the bulletin and deaths in ICUs, he said that it is possible as deaths are declared as and when reports arrive. In Ahmedabad, TOI visited five crematoriums in western city parts where 28 bodies were either being cremated with Covid protocols or were in queue for turn between 1pm and 5pm. The official toll on Tuesday was 23 but the figure doesn't count the morning and evening hours that records the highest cremations, which sources said was about 80-90 a day. While official figures are not available for Civil Hospital, the biggest tertiary care centre, the hospital alone records 50-odd deaths daily, said sources, adding that the mortalities in private hospitals and other government-run facilities are easily in the range of 100-120. "The ever-busy crematoriums are proof of the burden of Covid the city is experiencing," said a city-based doctor on condition of anonymity. Rajkot has seen 184 deaths in various government and private Covid hospitals from April 8 to April 12. Out of these, the death audit committees have declared 32 deaths, which it says, died ‘purely’ due to Covid. On Tuesday, another 59 people succumbed in the district.  “The government statistics may be different, but the reality is that, on an average, over 170 Covid-19 patients succumb to the virus and their final rites are being performed daily in the city,’‘ sources said.

The court has not given any order that says open the mosque, no such direction has been issued,” Justice Mukta Gupta said after Delhi Police and solicitor general Tushar Mehta highlighted that Khan is an MLA and not a layman, so is aware of what he was claiming. Justice Gupta told police to file any video available with it of Shab-e-Barat and April 12 night, showing violation of court directions. Police alleged that Khan was present in the mosque with a huge gathering and interfered in the inspection directed by court.

---||Goa||BJP violating model code through Tika Utsav: Congress||PANAJI: Congress accused BJP of trying to gain “cheap political mileage” during elections through the ‘Tika Utsav’ launched by the central and state governments. By organising Covid-19 vaccination camps in municipal wards where civic polls are going to be held, the government is violating the code of conduct imposed, Congress said on Tuesday. The party demanded that health minister Vishwajit Rane intervene in the matter and immediately stop the same so that there is no political interference in the inoculation drives. “After making business of peoples’ sickness during the nationwide lockdown last year, the insensitive BJP government’s politics of opportunism now stands exposed,” said state Congress general secretary Amarnath Panjikar. “The health minister must convene a meeting of all MLAs and come out with an action plan taking all stakeholders into confidence. No political interference must be allowed in the Covid vaccination drive.” Panjikar called the state government ‘irresponsible’ for violating the election code of conduct. “The publicity hungry BJP has printed leaflets and posters of Tika Utsav with photos of the local BJP functionaries. This is nothing but politics of opportunism,” Panjikar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-violating-model-code-through-tika-utsav-cong/articleshow/82056222.cms||---

---||Pune||Bogus doctor arrested for running hosp in Shirur||Pune: The district rural police on Monday arrested a man running a hospital at Karegaon in Shirur taluka for the past two years based on a bogus medical degree certificate and changed identity. A local crime branch team led by senior inspector Padmakar Ghanwat arrested Mehmood Shaikh (32) of Karegaon, running the hospital identifying himself as Mahesh Patil. “We have recovered the Aadhaar card and stamps under the name of Mahesh Patil from the suspect’s house,” Ghanwat said. Inspector Sureshkumar Raut of the Ranjangaon MIDC police said, “The suspect Shaikh is Standard XII pass. He had worked in a clinic in Nanded. He stole the MBBS certificate of the medical practitioner by the name Mahesh Patil and started practising by sticking his own photograph on the certificate. When the police team went to the suspect’s hospital, they found 22 Covid-19 patients admitted there. The patients have been shifted to another hospital.” Raut said Shaikh was produced before the court on Tuesday. He had been remanded in police custody till April 19, Raut said. Shaikh’s estranged partner, Shitalkumar Padvi of Nandurbar district, whom he duped of Rs17 lakh, lodged an FIR with the police. According to the complainant, Raut said, Padvi had first met the suspect in 2016. When they met again after two years, the suspect had told him that they would start a hospital in Shirur taluka in partnership. “The complainant had taken loan from a private finance firm for the hospital. The suspect started the hospital in 2019 at Karegaon in Shirur taluka without the complainant’s knowledge and later told him that he did not need his partnership and promised to return his investment,” Raut said. The complainant then returned to Nandurbar. He initially did not file any complaint. When the suspect did not return the money, he approached the police, the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bogus-doctor-arrested-for-running-hosp-in-shirur/articleshow/82056221.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||‘Residents can now directly close their complaints when resolved’||HYDERABAD: Rising Covid-19 cases – with many being reported from inside the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) headquarters – has left its grievance redressal system in a disarray. Residents visiting the GHMC office to register complaints say, that they are most often turned away by the security personnel, asked to return at a different time. Though the response on the ‘My GHMC’ mobile app and Twitter is fairly better, citizens rue that even there they often need to follow up on their grievances multiple times, before it is addressed. “I recently visited the GHMC head office to register a complaint about the mosquito menace in my area. But after travelling so far, I was told by the security guards that entry for visitors is restricted from 3 pm to 5 pm. I had to return disappointed because it was impossible for me to wait there under the scorching sun all afternoon,” said Mohammed Ahmed, a resident of Kawan. His complaints on social media too have gone in vain so far. While admitting to delays at times, civic officials say that they are working on strengthening their redressal mechanism. “We get around 400 to 500 complaints every day through different grievance redressal systems that are available to residents,” said D Jaya Raj Kennedy, assistant Commissioner (Finance and IT), GHMC, adding, “We are ensuring that our operators make feedback calls to citizens to ensure that their issue has been resolved. Despite that, we do come across instances where officials close a grievance without resolving the problem.” To avoid that, GHMC is now giving residents themselves to close a complaint (whoever has raised the complaint) once it is resolved. Also, in case a grievance is not resolved, officials said, a citizen can always call back and re-open the case. Meanwhile, Prajavani, the face-to-face grievance redressal system has temporarily been suspended due to increase in Covid-19 cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/residents-can-now-directly-close-their-complaints-when-resolved/articleshow/82055401.cms||Moulika.KV

These signals include B2 Bypass, Laxmi Mandir Tiraha, OTS Crossing and Jawahar Circle. These projects have been designed to create a confluence of art, heritage and technology and remove traffic lights on these junctions. An official informed, at B2 Bypass, an underpass connecting the Jawahar Circle to the Mansarovar side will be built which will have six lanes. It will be decorated with traditional art murals on both sides. "Six lanes would be maintained at grade. For turning traffic, two cloverleaves are to be built. These cloverleaves and underpasses will be equipped with all IT based systems and IoT platforms. Moreover, an 80-feet high arch in marble and stone craft will be built on the B2 Bypass," said the official.At Jawahar Circle , the civic body has proposed to remove the traffic light on the interface of JLN Road and Jawahar Circle by creating two major entry transitions, cuts in the median towards Jawahar Circle.As nearly 2 lakh cars ply on Laxmi Mandir Tiraha daily, the signal light of Laxmi Mandir will be removed by closing the median for the traffic coming from Sahkar Bhawan road on Tonk Road. The traffic will be moving on the road between Apex Bank and Nehru Place. An underpass will be constructed which will cross over the Tonk Road and open towards Sanganer side, thereby eliminating the traffic light at the junction. "The Gandhi Nagar traffic light is also proposed to be eliminated by creating an underpass and cloverleaf bridge," the official said.The OTS junction will also get rid of traffic light resulting in smooth movement on all directions. A detailed traffic survey was conducted which gave a total count of 1.8 lakh cars moving on OTS junction per day. "After an indepth study of movement of traffic, design of a cable stayed elevated bridge on JLN Road has been made taking care of the six-lane traffic on JLN Road. Also, a cloverleaf on Jhalana road would be built, which will take care of the turning traffic, especially that which creates bottlenecks on the road leading to Gopalpura," the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/feasibility-report-to-make-4-junctions-signal-free-okayed/articleshow/82056223.cms||---

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Hit-&-run turns out to be well-planned murder case||PUNE: The death of two women after a hit-and-run accident on April 1 involving a car at Nira in Purandar taluka, about 55km from the city, was a murder plot hatched by the paramour of one of the victims, police said. The Pune rural police have since arrested three persons in connection with the alleged crime. The arrested trio are Kiran Jedhe (38) of Nira, the man who had the illicit relationship with one of the victims, his cousin Ranjit Jedhe (32) and Sanket Hole (23) of Daund, a criminal on the police records who executed the plot. “Kiran wanted to eliminate the woman with whom he had an extra-marital relationship. But her woman friend also suffered grievous injury in the ‘accident’,” inspector Sunil Mahadik of the Jejuri police said. “The woman’s friend succumbed to the injuries on April 4. The other woman, for whom the murder plot was hatched, succumbed to injuries on Tuesday,” he said. Initially, the Jejuri police had treated the case as a hit-and-run accident. “We found the black hatchback car abandoned on the Nira bridge as if it had developed some technical issues after the dash,” Mahadik said. He said the car had no registration number plates. It was an attempt of the suspects to make it difficult for the police to trace its owner. “We minutely checked the car and found a receipt of battery charging. We found out that the car was being driven by the suspect, Hole. We also found that Hole had some previous criminal records,” Mahadik said. The police, with the help of technical investigation, traced Hole and took him into custody in the last week. “During the questioning, Hole spilled the beans and revealed that it was not an accident but a planned murder. He revealed the name of Ranjit, who had hired him for executing the murder of the woman, who was troubling his cousin, Kiran. Ranjit had promised Hole to provide all financial help in starting a restaurant,” Mahadik said. A day before the incident, Hole had come to Nira. On the early morning of April 1, Ranjit showed the woman to Hole from another car and drove away, Mahadik said. Mahadik said the arrested trio were produced before the court on Tuesday. Ranjit was remanded in four-day police custody and the other two were sent to Yerawada central prison under judicial custody,” Mahadik said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hit-run-turns-out-to-be-well-planned-murder-case/articleshow/82056210.cms||Mihir Tanksale

They even claimed that their repeated complaints to the Jal Sansthan officials went unanswered. “It’s been a month since the supply has been disrupted. The officials from Jal Sansthan did make several visits, but the problem was not resolved. On Tuesday, some repairing took place in our lane, but there is still no sign of water.

Similarly, the community will not organise any iftar treats. “Safety is more important, and we will observe Ramzan prayers and iftar at home. We will pray for the health and well-being of the entire country as well as the world,” said Saif Ahmed, a youth from Kondhwa employed with an MNC. Ramzan has started and the city Muslims have started observing the month-long fasting, also known as roza, from Wednesday. Rafiuddin Shaikh, secretary, Seerat committee, Pune, said, “We have issued advisories to 495 mosques in the city and Pimpri-Chinchwad to ensure that the five-time prayers, Friday and tarvaeeh namaz are not organised because of the surge in Covid19 virus cases in the district.” “The committee on April 13 had written a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackery to allow the community to offer taraveeh namaz with limited number of people in mosques for one month during Ramzan, but the state government did not consider our request,” he said. Haji Zakir Shaikh, president of All India Quami Tanzeem, Western Maharashtra, said, “The community should stay at home and offer prayers and help the district administration break chain of the virus. We have appealed to the community not to assemble in large numbers to offer prayers on building terraces or open place on the premises of housing societies or any other places. We have asked them to strictly adhere to the new Ramzan guidelines issued by the government.” Community leader Akbar Pathan said, “Five office bearers or trustees of the mosques will be allowed to offer namaz five times and other prayers as per the government guidelines. No iftar and saheri (a meal eaten before dawn during Ramzan) parties will be organised at masjids, hotels, community halls or private places.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/muslims-to-offer-namaz-at-home-with-mosques-shut/articleshow/82056226.cms||Asseem Shaikh

On Tuesday, 775 of the 1,925 fresh positive Covid-19 cases in Uttarakhand were reported from Dehradun. The state capital’s tally of coronavirus cases stands at 36,033. Some residents of the state capital said that several private labs had stopped testing, saying RT-PCR test kits had run out, even as long waiting hours at government hospitals continue to cause inconvenience. On April 8, when the positivity rate (PR) in Doon was 3.72 per cent, 6,423 tests (including antigen and RT-PCR) had been conducted in the district. The next day on April 9, 6,053 tests were conducted in Doon and the PR rose to 5.53 per cent. On April 10, 6,662 test samples were collected and the PR was 8.84. On April 11, the PR was 10.26 per cent and the number of samples collected 5,670. On April 12, 5,259 test samples were collected and the PR soared to 10.53 per cent. As of Tuesday, April 13, the PR stood at all time high with 11.22 per cent, with a total of 6,904 tests conducted on the day. “The health department has reduced testing in Dehradun in the past several days, even as the positivity rate (PR) is going up. It is vital to focus on testing and vaccination in Dehradun as the district may quickly become a hotspot,” said Anoop Nautiyal from Social Development for Communities Foundation, an organisation closely tracking the Covid-19 pandemic in the Himalayan state. Nikita Sahani from Rajpur Road said that a city-based private lab that used to collect RT-PCR samples from home was no longer conducting the tests. “The lab said it had stopped conducting RT-PCR tests. I need the test result for an examination and I don’t want to visit a hospital as it will expose me to the virus,” she said. Assistant chief medical officer (ACMO) Dr Rajiv Dixit said, “As far as we are aware, all private labs are collecting samples. They have the permission to do so. If a lab refuses to do it, it’s on them. So far, one lab has been asked to give an explanation for delay in real time data feed. As for sample testing, we are focusing on RT-PCR tests and collecting a good amount of samples every day.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/tests-fail-to-keep-up-with-steadily-rising-covid-positivity-rate-in-doon/articleshow/82054786.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Kochi||Kerala: HC declines to stay Lok Ayukta’s report against KT Jaleel||KOCHI: The high court on Tuesday declined to stay a Lok Ayukta report declaring that KT Jaleel was unfit to continue as a minister for having engaged in nepotism and favouritism. A division bench of Justice PB Suresh Kumar and Justice K Babu declined to issue a stay after hearing the petition by Jaleel for about one-and-a-half-hours. Jaleel had resigned from the post of minister while the hearing was proceeding. After the counsels representing Jaleel, the state government, and the complainant made their submissions, the court asked whether the minister was still in office. The counsel replied that the minister has already resigned. The court refused to stay the Lok Ayukta’s report and reserved the case for pronouncing orders. Jaleel’s counsel had argued on Tuesday that the Lok Ayukta did not have the power to consider a complaint regarding appointment and that there is a specific bar under the Lok Ayukta Act. The Lok Ayukta also did not follow the procedure laid out in the Act while considering the complaint. No investigation as envisaged under the Act was carried out, the counsel submitted. State government’s counsel also supported these arguments. Senior advocate George Poonthottam, who represented complainant Muhammad Shafi, argued that no procedure is specified in the Act for conducting an investigation. The Lok Ayukta only needs to be satisfied that the complaint needs to be proceeded upon. Lok Ayukta’s report is comprehensive and all relevant documents were perused, it was submitted. Jaleel’s petition had contended that the appointment was questioned before the high court and the governor earlier but those complaints were not entertained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-declines-to-stay-lok-ayuktas-report-against-jaleel/articleshow/82055402.cms||---

According to Swasthya Bhawan sources, the health department has already issued a directive to all the Covid hospitals and the civic body in this regard. However, the private hospitals have also been asked to keep ambulances reserved for the Covid patients who may need hospitalisation during the isolation period. According to a source in Nabanna, while the state department has a fleet of around 140 ambulances for Kolkata the civic body has augmented its fleet that now stands at 30. However, the KMC is in the process of tying up with NGOs and social clubs to increase the number of ambulances for Covid patients. Earlier, a section of Covid patients had to suffer owing to the non-availability of government-run ambulances. So, an alert has been sounded this time following a surge in the number of Covid patients. “Last year, some private healthcare agencies had extorted several Covid patients who needed immediate hospitalisation. We are alert this time and will try to transport the serious patients, using the KMC and state-run ambulance fleets,” said a health department official. A senior official at Nabanna said there was no need to be panicked at this stage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-state-hosps-asked-to-arrange-for-ambulances/articleshow/82055397.cms||Saikat Ray

This is also higher than the period when deaths peaked during the first wave of the pandemic. At a meeting held with doctors and officials of other departments on Covid, chief minister Ashok Gehlot expressed his worries over rising fatalities. “The deaths peaked in late October and November last year during the first wave. But more deaths are being reported at the start of the second wave compared to the peak of the first wave. This is a cause of concern,” he said. For the administration, deaths are also being reported increasingly from rural areas, around 30% in April, compared to 70% in urban areas. Also, the above 60 years age group is seen to be the most vulnerable, reporting 65% of the total deaths (87) during this period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/161-fatalities-in-april-setalarm-bells-ringing-in-raj/articleshow/82056247.cms||---
---||Pune||Homebound Gudi Padwa celebrations for 2nd year||Pune: Citizens celebrated Gudi Padwa at home amid the pandemic for the second year on Tuesday, but they tried to make the most of it. “Gudi Padwa is a grand celebration in the office every year. Last year, I was at home with my parents and wife in Dhule, so it was a refreshing change, even though we were in the middle of a lockdown. As I came back to the city to resume work earlier this year, I found myself alone during the festival and felt I was missing out. As I don’t know how to make ‘puran poli’, I ordered some from a restaurant, so that I could celebrate it in a small way on my own,” Kunal Lawate, a BPO employee, said. Though the festive spirit of the city seems to be dampened by restrictions on movement, some believe that a celebration is important during such dark times. “The society my in-laws live in is sealed due to Covid. Even though we couldn’t meet this year, I sent some home-made sweets to them via delivery service. We also spoke to them on video call when we did our ‘puja’ and other rituals, so they could feel like they were a part of the celebrations,” Sunita Londe, a homemaker, said. Rahul Chandekar, owner of a pre-owned vehicle shop, said this was the second year there was no business during Gudi Padwa, which used to be one of the days they would make the most sales. “However, we understand the situation calls for such strict regulations and we just have to wait it out. Even though we are not working, I thought it was important to keep the festive spirit alive and so I sent sweet boxes to my employees,” he said. A big part of any Indian festival is the food, said another citizen. “As long as we had a grand feast, there was enough celebration for us at home. My family was together, we were working from home. We took the time to reflect on the past year and figured that we have a lot to be thankful for still. We hope this is the last Gudi Padwa we have to celebrate with such anxiousness and uncertainty about the future,” said Mitali Sondekar, a professional.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/homebound-gudi-padwa-celebrations-for-2nd-year/articleshow/82056230.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Hotel body offers 500 rooms for Cov care||Kolkata: The Hotel and Restaurants Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) has offered 500 rooms as satellite hospital units in next few days to combat the second wave of Covid. The association had accommodated 2,000 hotel rooms during the first wave of the pandemic. The number of rooms will gradually go up to 2,000. The association has already written to the principal secretary of health, N S Nigam, in this regard and the proposal was discussed with chief secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay on Tuesday. The HRAEI delegation was represented by its president, Sudesh Poddar, secretary, Md Azhar, and former president, Parnav Singh. “For the last few days, we are getting 20-25 calls daily from asymptomatic Covid patients for hotel rooms but we need permission from the government to provide that. When the first wave of the pandemic was at its peak in July-September, we joined hand with the hospitals and the state government also helped in the negotiations,” said Poddar. This time too, the state wants that the hotels for Covid patients should be attached with some hospitals for emergency, according to Poddar. “The chief secretary has welcomed the proposal,” he added. The association has over 800 members in Bengal and 60,000 beds belonging to its members. In a letter to Nigam, the HRAEI president has stated that earlier, they had offered hotel rooms for self-isolation, housing quarantined passengers, doctors, medical workers and others. HRAEI had also tied up with the hospitals as isolation centres to host mild asymptomatic Covid-19 positive patients.  “We have provided more than 2,600 rooms across 65 hotels as quarantine facilities and our member establishments have offered to provide the isolation wards and beds for Covid positive patients. We implore you to give us an opportunity to serve the mankind by accommodating in our member hotels both mildly symptomatic patients and those who do not require medical assistance but have tested positive and need to be isolated from their families on use and pay basis,” the HRAEI president wrote in the letter. The association has also requested the state government to provide them a list of the towns and cities where rooms for quarantine centres will be required so that they can request their members to provide rooms. “During the first wave of Covid majority of the hotel rooms earmarked for this were occupied,” Poddar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hotel-body-offers-500-rooms-for-cov-care/articleshow/82055403.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Hotel occupancy dips to 25% due to 2nd wave||JAIPUR: The second wave of the pandemic has again disrupted the tourism industry with almost 70% of the bookings in hotels getting cancelled. The long week-end, which promised to be a rush hour for the hospitality business, has turned out be a washout. Industry representatives said the mandatory RT-PCR negative report for travellers coming by road and flights, and the rising number of cases in Jaipur have brought down occupancy levels in hotels to 20-25% which was last seen in September and October last year. They said while the night curfew has also been a reason why tourists are cancelling the bookings, some were apprehensive about the possibility of state borders getting sealed as happened last time and getting holed up. Jaideep Singh Balhara said that now-a-days two to three flights are getting cancelled every day due to less load factor. “Before the pandemic, the airport used to receive about 14,000 people per day. After flight services resumed, we have reached to an average of 10,000 people before the second wave started in March. Now, that number has come down to about 4500.” Similarly, visitors from Delhi, Gurgaon and Noida who preferred road travel have also postponed their visits due to the requirement of negative RT-PCR report. “Cancellation requests are pouring in large numbers. Almost 70% of the bookings for the weekend got wiped out and the industry occupancy has again fallen to below 25%. You cannot blame anybody but this is the difficulty that the industry is facing today. The restrictions are as good as lockdown,” said Surendra Singh Shahpura, a hotelier. Recently, state minister for tourism Govind Singh Dotasra had said that the government does like to impose restrictions but there is no other way to control the pandemic. “Tourism is the most affected segment during the pandemic. But we cannot allow unrestricted entry of people. We have to look at all aspects of life and society, including business and industry. It’s difficult time for everybody. We are also worried the children are not able to attend schools,” Dotasra had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hotel-occupancy-dips-to-25-due-to-2nd-wave/articleshow/82056231.cms||---

The Marathi film, titled Mahapurush Dr Ambedkar, was produced by the Director of Publicity, Government of Maharashtra, in July 1968. Directed by Namdeo Vatkar under the banner of Vathkar Productions, the music for the 18-minute short film was composed by renowned composer Datta Davajekar. “It is a very timely discovery of the film on Dr BR Ambedkar, when we are celebrating his 130th birth anniversary on April 14. The short film fictionalises key events of Dr Ambedkar’s life and it also has live footage of his later years,” said Prakash Magdum, NFAI director. The film includes visuals of Ambedkar embracing the Buddhist religion and his visit to Nepal along with close-up shots of his funeral procession at Dadar Chowpatty in Mumbai. Madhukar Khamkar worked on the cinematography while GG Patil has edited the film. “The film was originally made in 35 mm format but what we have found is a 16 mm copy probably meant for distribution in rural areas. The condition of the film is moderate, and we plan to digitise it soon so that it can be accessed by people. We appeal to individual collectors and distributors along with others to come forward and submit films or footage at NFAI so that it can be preserved,” said Magdum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nfai-gets-short-film-on-ambedkar/articleshow/82056235.cms||---

The administration's move to not allow pilgrims to the city markets after the second bathing festival had been vehemently opposed by the traders. A local trade leader Sanjeev Nayyar said, “The Mela police had assured us that the pilgrims would be allowed on market routes. However, they instead stopped the devotees at various checkposts. Hence, we refused to attend the meeting with mela officials. We don't want either the pilgrims or locals to be stopped without any valid reason." Mela IG Sanjay Gunjyal said, “We will allow pilgrims to enter the market routes after the Shahi Snan. However, nobody will be allowed at Har-ki-Pauri during the time allotted for akhadas."

Mohd Suleman further said that some hospitals are using Oxygen excessively, which amounts to wastage. In this way 39% Oxygen is being wasted, which needs to be checked. Oxygen should be given to patients according to requirement and not in excess, he said. He further said that supply of Remdesivir to medical colleges and Covid-19 hospitals has begun. Directives have been issued to give the injection to serious patients only on the prescription of a doctor, he said. The number of Oxygen beds are being increased both in government and private hospitals and Covid care centres have been opened for asymptomatic patients. Mohd Suleman said that local and outside labs are being contacted to ensure that the test report is received within a day. Hospitals have also been asked to start treatment of a patient showing symptoms of coronavirus infection even if his report has not been received. Sarang said if a patient is required to be admitted in a hospital for Covid-19 treatment, he must be admitted in the hospital. Vigil should be maintained in all the hospitals and officials should undertake inspection of hospitals to see that Covid-19 patients get proper treatment. The number of Oxygen beds should be progressively increased and Oxygen should be given to seriously ill patients first. In houses, where there is not enough space for home isolation, the patient should be shifted to a Covid Care Centre. Principal secretary, health, Faiz Ahmed Kidwai, Bhopal commissioner, Kavindra Kiyawat and collector, Avinash Lavania also participated in the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/1200-additional-beds-for-covid-patients-soon/articleshow/82055404.cms||---

After a complaint was filed by family members of Gomes, the Matheran Police have asked the hill station municpal council and forest department to furnish papers of permission given to the hotel for tents. Gomes and her friend Karishma Gupta were sleeping in a tent in an open space inside Alexander Heritage and Rainforest Resorts during their stay in Matheran. In the wee hours of March 21, Gupta suddenly felt some weight on her leg and got up to see Gomes lying unconscious and bleeding from her head. With help from guests at the hotel, Gomes was taken to the local BJ Hospital-Matheran for treatment and later shifted to Fortis hospital in Kalyan. She was then admitted to Kokilaben hospital in city. “The accident was because of nature and our hotel should not be held responsible for it. I personally arranged ambulance and accompanied the victim to the hospital.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Opposition: No morality in Jaleel’s resignation||Thiruvananthapuram: Opposition parties have flayed the resignation of K T Jaleel and said it was not based on moral grounds but he had no other alternative. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said Jaleel’s resignation cannot be claimed as based on ethical principles. “If he had morality, then he would have resigned the same day when the Lok Ayukta order came. Now, he had to resign since the public sentiment was against him,” he said. “It will not end with his resignation. Now he will have to face prosecution as per the Lok Ayukta Act,” Chennithala added. The chief minister also cannot run away from the responsibility of nepotism charges against Jaleel. He too was a silent partner in this deal. The chief minister had purposefully kept the cabinet in the dark over the appointment of Jaleel’s relative and also in amending the qualifications for the post, he said. “CPM had first taken a stand that there was no need for the minister to resign. Law minister A K Balan himself had made this clear before the media. He had also said that nowhere it is written that a relative of a minister cannot be appointed on deputation. So how can the CPM claim morality now?” he asked. BJP state president K Surendran said the matter never ends with the resignation of Jaleel. “The records of the involvement of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the appointment of the relative of Jaleel have also come out. The chief minister also should resign,” said Surendran. Union minister V Muraleedharan said that in this case the breach of office was not done by Jaleel alone. “The chief minister also has done the same breach of office by approving the appointment. It is a pity that now the CPM is claiming political morality when the party stood by him when the Lok Ayukta order had come,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/opposition-no-morality-in-jaleels-resignation/articleshow/82055411.cms||---

The cub had taken shelter at Papalwadi village in Khed tehsil. Upon being spotted, the villagers informed the forest officials and NGO staff. They carried out a medical checkup of the cub and later united it with the mother via a reunion plan. Over the years, the wild cats of Maharashtra have adapted to habitat modification. They have moved out of shrinking forests and into dense sugarcane fields. Female leopards often leave their young ones under the safe cover of the sugarcane fields while they go out to hunt for food. However, more often than not, the cubs face the risk of being exposed, because farmers move around the fields, especially during the harvest season, explained a forest official. Pradeep Kasare, range forest officer, Khed, said, “A few boys from the village saw that the cub was in danger and ran to its rescue. They immediately contacted us, and we dispatched a team to the location. We are happy that the cub was successfully reunited with its mother.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-month-old-leopard-cub-rescued-reunited-with-mother-in-khed-tehsil/articleshow/82056246.cms||Sandip Dighe

A video that purportedly shows the man killing himself was recovered from her. Though the woman claimed she shot the video thinking that he was only threatening to commit suicide like he had done on other occasions in the past, Howrah City Police said there were inconsistencies in her statement and her claim needed to be probed. She was arrested under IPC 306. According to police, Amon Shaw and Neha Shukla had married on December 11 last year. The couple, hailing from Liluah, quit their jobs after marriage and Amon started a business. Amon’s elder sister Barkha Prasad claimed it was a tour to Delhi Neha undertook alone on March 31 that led to serious differences between the couple. “Amon wanted to go with her but she refused. We suspected that she might be hiding something,” said Barkha. On April 5, Neha returned to Kolkata and sought an immediate divorce despite knowing that her in-laws were going to Vellore for treatment, Barkha claimed. The Shaw family was still in Vellore when the Bally police asked them to return, saying that Amon had committed suicide at their rented accommodation at Tarka Sidhantha Lane in Bally. “We were surprised at Neha’s extremely calm demeanour. We seized her phone and found the video. When we asked her why she did not stop him, she kept saying that she thought Amon was giving an empty threat. We lodged a police complaint on Monday after which the cops detained her” claimed Barkha. None from the girl’s family were ready to talk to TOI about the incident. The Bally police said they have seized the phone where the video was recorded. “We cannot rule out the possibility that she had some motive in recording this,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/woman-catches-hubby-killing-self-on-cam-held/articleshow/82055409.cms||Rupak Banerjee

"We deputed an official to ensure that the garbage was immediately cleared from the street. Our staff is also keeping an eye to make sure people use proper means of garbage disposal in the area and avoid dumping it in the open," said Srinivas Reddy, zonal commissioner, GHMC. According to the locals, the issue of garbage being dumped in the open was persisting from several months before the officials took the initiative to clean the entire space. "Despite complaints to the local civic authorities, people would repeatedly use the space as a dumping ground. With the number of Covid-19 cases increasing, it is very important that we keep our surroundings clean," said Keertana Somayajula, the citizen reporter who highlighted the problem. Another citizen from Kacheguda said that it was a recurring problem and officials must conduct regular inspections in the area to see that the problem does not resurface. "The garbage was piling up so much that the commuters taking the road were facing a serious problem because of all the plastic waste that was flying onto their faces. At times, there used to slush gushing out from the garbage making the road very slippery. We are happy that the issue is resolved now," said Sampath Kumar, an IT professional. Officials of the civic body also informed that they recently found that more than 60% of biodegradable waste is wrapped in plastic bags and since the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, face masks and sanitizer bottles are adding to the plastic waste being dumped in open garbage bins. The corporation so far has found 30% of plastic waste, including masks and sanitizer bottles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/civic-staff-clear-out-garbage-from-kacheguda-colony-within-48-hrs/articleshow/82055408.cms||---

In Jaipur, only 40 government centres had vaccines. Out of those, 23 had Covaxin and 19 had Covishield. Amid surging cases, the state government has demanded the Centre to supply 30 lakh doses of vaccines. Over the last six days (from April 7), the health department had to scale down vaccination drive due to limited availability of doses. The number of people vaccinated on Tuesday was 1,48,138. “We have a capacity of vaccinating 7 lakh per day,” said Raghu Sharma, health minister. According to health department officials, they are now having more than 2.3 lakh doses available, which they have to use judiciously before the state receives supply of doses from the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/stock-crunch-hits-vaccination-drive/articleshow/82056249.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Daily wage worker from Uttarakhand wins Rs 57 lakh playing virtual fantasy game||NAINITAL: Himanshu Kohli, 23, woke up to his life’s biggest surprise on Monday. The daily wager from Mangruprahari, a nondescript village in Uttarakhand’s Bageshwar district, who makes Rs 250 on a good day by taking up odd jobs around his village, found Rs 57 lakh credited to his IPL fantasy league account. The team he had selected for Sunday’s Kolkata Knight Riders vs Sunrisers Hyderabad match the night before had topped the charts. Kohli has a diploma in industrial training and after losing his job in Rudrapur, now takes up MGNREGS works and other odd jobs like his family. He lives with his parents and older brother. “On Sunday, I returned home after painting a house. I was tired and in no mood to select a team, but my brother persuaded me to. I played a round by paying Rs 49 but never imagined I would be a millionaire the next morning.” Virtual platforms allow the user to form a team, choosing players from the day’s match, and then based on those players’ performances, the team is rewarded points and ranked. These platforms allow one to choose from a variety of sports but cricket, especially IPL, is the craze in India. Kohli, an avid cricket fan and player, said his team selection was merely reluctant guesswork. The family’s TV at home doesn’t get sports channels and he didn’t follow the match or the performances after constituting the team. “We never had the money to buy a new TV and we don’t have the time to watch cricket. I had no idea who won, who lost or which player scored how many runs. In the morning, I casually checked the app and for the first few minutes, could not believe what I saw – I had topped the rankings and won Rs 57 lakh,” Kohli told TOI over the phone. After tax cuts, he will receive Rs 40 lakh in a few days. Kohli said he had started playing in the fantasy league a couple of months back during the India-England series on the recommendation of a friend. “In the beginning, I dabbled in it without really understanding the rules. Till now, I have invested Rs 400 in the game. By some miracle, the amount I received in return would have taken me a lifetime to earn,” he said. With his new-found wealth, Kohli plans to refurbish his house, start a business and continue to play the game.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/daily-wage-worker-from-uttarakhand-wins-rs-57-lakh-playing-virtual-fantasy-game/articleshow/82054799.cms||Prashant Jha

Deshmukh added that these religious leaders including head priests of temples and imaams of mosques have also made videos appealing to the public to follow the norms. “We have circulated these videos on various social networking platforms, CLG groups of various police stations and urged public to widely circulate it. Also, loudspeakers of religious places have been used to make mass appeal to the public to follow guidelines,” Deshmukh added. “All meetings with the religious leaders have been fruitful so far.

In his Facebook post, while justifying his innocence, Jaleel also took potshots at his political opponents by referring to some of the controversies that were raised against them. He said that he did not step down for making any loss to the government or for living a luxurious life or for accepting a single rupee from anyone. Without naming them, he referred to the allegations of disproportionate assets raised against IUML leader K M Shaji, the graft case against former minister and IUML leader V K Ebrahhim Kunju and the allegations against Youth League leader P K Firos for irregularities in the funds raised for helping the victim of Kathua incident. Jaleel further said that it is his firm belief that he has not committed anything wrong that helped him withstand the attacks by the opposition and the media. Jaleel did not spare the central investigating agencies either. He said that three agencies were probing him in and out, and still unable to find an iota of wrongful act on his part is a recognition for his clean public life. He went on to say that when nothing was found against him, the present case of adverse remarks by the Lok Ayukta has come as a reason for those who have been searching for one. The resignation was tendered holding the moral values high, without waiting for the high court to pronounce its verdict, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/quitting-to-uphold-moral-values-says-jaleel-in-fb-post/articleshow/82055414.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||India||After Didi, BJP netas face EC ire for provocative remarks||NEW DELHI: A day after it slapped a 24-hour campaign ban on Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee for alleged communal remarks and exhorting voters to ‘gherao’ paramilitary personnel, the Election Commission served a notice to BJP’s Bengal chief Dilip Ghosh for suggesting there would be more Sitalkuchi-like incidents if “someone crosses his limits” in the next phase of polling on April 17. The EC also banned BJP leader Rahul Sinha — while consciously deciding not to precede its order with a notice — over his remarks that “eight, and not four, people should have been killed” in the Sitalkuchi firing. As for Suvendu Adhikari, Mamata’s former aide and now her opponent in Nandigram who was under the EC scanner for his “begum” and “mini-Pakistan” jibes during a March 29 speech, the poll panel took a lenient view after he promised to abide by the EC’s directives. He was let off with a warning and advice to desist from using such statements in his public utterances during the election period. Four people were killed in firing by CISF personnel at a polling station in Sitalkuchi during polling on April 10. Reports sought by the EC said the paramilitary personnel resorted to firing “in self-defence” against a violent mob. The EC, in its notice to Ghosh, said it was of the view that he had, in violation of the model code of conduct, Section 123(3A) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, and Section 153A of the IPC (the latter two dealing with promoting communal hatred) “made statements that are provocative and can seriously incite the emotions and lead to breakdown of law and order, thereby adversely affecting the election process”. The EC gave him time until 10 am on Wednesday to explain. While addressing a public rally in Barangar, North 24 Parganas on April 11, Ghosh had said, “Where did so many naughty boys come from? Those naughty boys were shot at yesterday in Sitalkuchi. These naughty boys will not be there in Bengal. Those who thought that the central forces' rifles were meant to be just for show have well understood now the power of cartridges. And this will be carried on throughout Bengal. Those who take the law in their own hands will be given a befitting answer. I hope that you all will queue up to cast your votes on the morning on April 17. Central forces will be there in the booths. No one can show you an angry eye. Because we are here. And if someone crosses his limits, then you have seen what happened in Sitalkuchi. There will be Sitalkuchi in several places.” Trinamool Congress had complained to the EC against Ghosh’s “inflammatory” statement, saying it was an “open threat to Bengal and its people”. Strongly condemning Sinha’s statement during a speech on April 12, the EC barred him from campaigning in any manner from 12 noon on Tuesday to 12 noon on Thursday. He had said, “The central forces have given them a befitting answer. The central forces should have killed eight people instead of four in Sitalkuchi. The central forces should be issued a show cause notice as to why they have killed only four of them.” Stating that it had decided to issue the order against him without serving a notice “due to urgency of the matter,” the EC chided him for “his highly provocative statements mocking human life, and inciting the forces that could have serious law and order implications, thereby adversely affecting the election process”. The order on Adhikari cited his explanation that he firmly believed in free and fair elections with no ill-will between candidates or personal attacks, that he had no mala fide intention to criticise anyone personally or make any offensive or derogatory remarks against anyone, and that he had not violated the model code but would be more careful in the future. Adhikari also promised to abide by any directives of the EC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-didi-bjp-netas-face-ec-ire-for-provocative-remarks/articleshow/82058171.cms||---

People should be careful while making land deals,” he said. “However, people might not escape from the fear surrounding Covid-19 infection and other issues. The government and temples would reap good income, but expenditure would increase on administration front and towards pleasing the people. The Centre-state relations would continue to be amicable, he added.“It will be a good year for educational institutions too. Women will continue to dominate in most fields,” he said. As the name Plava Nama signifies that it is a traverse from darkness into light, the Telugu new year would bring peace and happiness with it for all sections of people, particularly farmers. He predicted that though there could be a delayed monsoon, the state would witness good rains and reap bumper crop and get good results in all its endeavours. Government and banking sector would achieve significant progress. Panchangam sravanam (the tradition of reciting the almanac on Ugadi day) was conducted at the endowments office at Boggulkunta and attended by endowments minister A Indrakaran Reddy among others. Due to the prevailing Covid-19 situation, the event was a low-key affair, the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/good-tidings-for-all-panchangam/articleshow/82055789.cms||Roushan Ali

Milk parlours, medical shops and fruit/vegetable shops were open but those who have not stocked enough grocery to last for another week must have been worried to see grocery shops closed. Grocery shops have been allowed to operate but only for home delivery and traders thought it better not to open their shops at all. Traffic on roads was thin but considerably more than what is expected in a lockdown and towards the evening, it grew thicker probably because people, who had gone to their offices, started coming back home. Norms of lockdown decided for the city impacted “containment zones” of Shahpura and Kolar as well as milk parlours, which have permission to remain open from 6.00 am to 10.00 am for milk distribution in “containment zones”, were open in the evening as well like elsewhere in the city. Some vegetable vendors carrying vegetables in their hand carts also strayed into the “containment zone”, much to the relief of residents, who could sight them and bought some green stuff from them. Prices of vegetables, fruits, cigarettes and gutkha saw an instant hike in prices on the first day of lockdown itself. Pan shops were not open but cigarettes and gutkha were being sold from some milk parlours. Other parts of the city don’t have the kind of heavy barricading that the 7 wards under “containment zones” have. Police pickets were there, manned mainly by traffic police, who stared at people passing by but stopped only a few. It was an auspicious day for Hindus with Navratri beginning today as also the new Vedic year (Samvatsar). “Gudi Padwa” and “Baisakhi” were also celebrated on Tuesday. Though temples were closed, devouts offered prayers to God on the first day of the year from outside the temple while priests inside could be seen offering special prayers to God particularly in the temples of the Goddess. Some people complained that if government offices and industries could open during lockdown, why not private offices. “Closure of markets, religious places and tourist spots is OK but if people go in their vehicles to an office, where Corona norms are being followed. What is wrong in it? Giving an impression that government servants are doing more important jobs than workers in private offices is not fair”, said Manish Singh, a businessman, who has his office near New Market. There were also demands that at a time when “work from home” is in vogue, at least some shops dealing in sale and repair of computer parts should remain open during lockdown. “I am a computer professional. My PC is not working today. I only need a chord to make it work. I have come to MP Nagar thinking that some computer shop may be open but there is none”, said Deepak Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/corona-curfew-halts-bhopal-in-last-yrs-lockdown-rerun/articleshow/82054888.cms||Ashutosh Shukla
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: At 112 +ve cases, My Home Jewel now a Covid cluster||HYDERABAD: Amid the recent surge of Covid-19 infections, several gated communities are becoming mini epicentres of outbreak. Among them is My Home Jewel in Madinaguda which currently has 112 Covid-19 positive cases, 11 of them testing positive on Monday. Representatives of owners’ association said despite the rise in cases, there has been little support from Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation. “We have 112 cases now with some households entirely affected. Right from quarantine measures to arranging their daily requirements and taking them to hospital when required, we are doing everything by ourselves. When we contacted GHMC and health officials, we were told there are no quarantine instructions for them as of now. So we took it upon ourselves,” said general secretary of My Home Jewel Owners’ Association, Nand Kishore. Meanwhile, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) officials said that sanitisation of floors of affected buildings has been taken up by them. A resident from another gated community close to My Home Jewel said that his entire family are currently infected. “It took barely a day for the infection to spread from one member to the entire family,” he said over the phone. Health authorities too have confirmed that outbreaks are being reported in many gated communities. “Whenever we conduct tests, 20 to 30 per cent of people are testing positive overall. The spread is taking place everywhere, including gated communities. Most patients at My Home Jewel are under home isolation. Whenever a positive case is reported, we test all their primary contacts. Elderly persons who have come in contact with a patient are testing positive. Home isolation kits which include medicines are being supplied to patients at government hospitals and those reporting their positive status to us,” said Rangareddy district medical and health officer, Dr Srujana. My Home Jewel has nearly 8,000 residents and had seen less than 20 cases during the initial wave of the pandemic. Given the current situation, a help desk for Covid-19-related issues has been set up within the community. “We are keeping track of all positive residents, ensuring that standard operating procedures are implemented. There is frequent sanitisation of common areas and we ensure that basic amenities like food and medicine are supplied at the doorstep of the affected household,” Nand Kishore said. Like many other gated communities and housing societies, WhatsApp updates of each new case are being circulated to keep residents informed. Given the surge in infections, the My Home Jewel association has also kept an ambulance on standby on the premises for quick transfer of patients to hospitals along with PPE kits and drivers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/at-112-ve-cases-my-home-jewel-now-a-covid-cluster/articleshow/82055468.cms||Amrita Didyala

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Ugadi celebrations toned down, but pandemic no dampener||HYDERABAD: Locals celebrated Ugadi, albeit in a low-key manner, across the city on Tuesday. While some offered special prayers at their area temples, others decorated their homes with flowers. Preparations of Ugadi pachadi, which constitutes six different tastes to represent different emotions and phases of life, were prepared across homes. As is customary, locals got up and tuned in to Panchanga Sravanam. “There can be no better reminder of the bitter-sweet journey of life than the Ugadi pachadi. This year we are celebrating the festival at home by preparing some traditional Ugadi dishes,” said Samhitha Kumari, a resident of Himayat Nagar. Celebrations, despite the high enthusiasm, remained subdued this year too as a result of the pandemic. “We have not let the pandemic dampen our spirits. We have followed all safety measures and stayed home but made sure we did not miss celebrations. We decorated our house with mango leaves, neem flowers and a rangoli. I hope that at least this year, all the gloom of the past is replaced with positivity and hope,” said G Raghav, a resident of Begumpet. Teaching his children the recipe for Ugadi Pachadi with raw mangoes, jaggery, tamarind, neem flowers, chillies and salt, Raghav said it was one of those rare occasions when children are interested in cooking. “Since it’s not encouraged to let them go and out an play, they are helping us out while also learning these traditions. While it is a customary for the government to organise celebrations, this year, as per CM K Chandrashekhar Rao’s directions to avoid religious gatherings, festivities were observed without much fanfare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ugadi-celebrations-toned-down-but-pandemic-no-dampener/articleshow/82055720.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: The minister who courted a series of controversies||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: KT Jaleel courted controversies in succession after chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan appointed him as the minister of higher education in August 2018. It was argued that he was appointed as minister to give a new impetus to higher education sector in state. But, Jaleel —who was first sworn as the local self-government minister in Pinarayi cabinet— raked up a series of controversies as he started usurping the autonomy of state universities by intervening in academic and non-academic affairs of the varsities. As the minister started considering university vice-chancellors as his subordinates and vice-chancellors too failing to assert their authority, universities —for the first time in the history of the state— started working as the sub-offices of higher education department. Flouting norms, the department —in association with universities— conducted university adalats, which ended up as avenues for gifting marks at the behest of the minister. The minister, with his department officials and personal staff, attended adalats in most state universities. The adalats soon attracted criticisms from eminent academicians like higher education council vice-chairman Rajan Gurukkal. In an adalat at MG University, the minister gave instructions to the syndicate to issue orders granting five extra marks to BTech candidates who failed only in one subject. The issue flared up and was challenged before the governor and the court. Following this, the varsity withdrew the marks given at the behest of the minister. However, it was his intervention to help a BTech student of Kerala Technological University that spelled trouble for Jaleel. The minister, in an adalat, forced the university to change rules regarding revaluation. The minister set up a team of experts to revaluate for the third-time the answer paper of a BTech student who failed in a paper. As per university norms, revaluation of an answer paper is possible only twice and VC had rejected the request for a third revaluation. The governor, who is also the chancellor of universities, had later conducted an inquiry into the mark gifting and warned university heads against indulging in similar activities in future. He also rapped the minister for poking his nose into academic affairs of universities. Most of the appointments made in universities since 2018 led to controversies due to the alleged interventions by the minister. However, the minister defended and justified each of his act by trying to project them as humanitarian interventions. In the thick of several such controversies, he proclaimed his intention to ‘repeat the charges against him’. The controversy that cost him his chair erupted by 2018-end when Muslim Youth League’s former secretary PK Firos alleged nepotism by saying that the minister had appointed his close relative KT Adeeb as the general manager of minority development corporation by tweaking qualification norms. Controversies of a more serious nature surfaced when he was accused of keeping close ties with the UAE consulate in the state capital. The minister was quizzed by central investigating agencies on the charges that he imported copies of Quran in large numbers from the UAE and accepted large quantity of dates from that country without following norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/the-minister-who-courted-a-series-of-controversies/articleshow/82055421.cms||B S Anilkumar
---||Kolkata||Case spike prompts gated communities to switch back to isolation mode, cancel Poila Baisakh plans||Kolkata: It is yesterday once more in many housing complexes of the city as several families are reporting Covid positive and getting into isolation. A pall of gloom has descended over these complexes as the committees of the residential societies are forming Covid task forces again to throw a protective ring around the affected families, ensuring that they are safe and taken care of. All plans that had been drawn up for the new year celebrations on Poila Baisakh have been officially cancelled. On Monday, a Covid patient turned critical at the Upohar housing complex off the EM Bypass and needed immediate hospitalisation. Scarcity of beds was being reported from hospitals around the complex, but the board of members, as the committee is called here, did not give up and finally managed a bed at the R N Tagore hospital. “The security has been briefed and no visitors are being allowed to these flats. Everything is being left at their doorsteps and the lifts, lobbies, common areas are once again being sanitised at regular intervals. We have cancelled all Poila Baisakh celebrations like last year. Usually there are in-house cultural programmes, adda sessions and refreshments but no question of these any more,” said spokesperson Sudeep Ganguly. Urbana complex already has 40 cases, forcing the community to cancel all celebration plans. “Isolation is a clinical safety need but we need to make those affected feel cared for. We are just a phone call away, taking care of their medical and other needs,” said S Ramani Iyer, a spokesperson. Some complexes, like Siddha Pines that have 16 people affected at the moment, have issued a fresh set of strictures like no booking of the complex guest house and banquet halls, no classes for kids in the common and open areas. “We have cancelled our community programme for the new year. The situation is grave once again,” said Manav Mehera, president of the committee. The Silver Spring Complex echoed this. “We have cancelled our celebrations and told residents to put on mark in open space,” said Indranil Chowdhury, spokesperson for the complex.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/case-spike-prompts-gated-communities-to-switch-back-to-isolation-mode-cancel-poila-baisakh-plans/articleshow/82055419.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The entomology wing has 2,400 staff, who have been deployed to contain Covid-19 spread. “Apart from regular sanitisation work, GHMC is faced with another challenge this summer as cases have gone up due to the second wave. Additional staff are working relentlessly to control the spread. They have been visiting areas with more number of positive cases,” GHMC chief entomologist Dr Rambabu said. GHMC staff were also disinfecting hospitals, offices, court buildings, the assembly building, police stations, private hospitals and markets, where positive cases have been identified. Sanitisation is being done with sodium hypochlorite.

The accused, Swajan Kumar Vikas was posted as SDM in Chitrakoot when a woman had lodged a FIR against him under Section 376 at Nawabad police station in January 2019. In her complaint, the victim had mentioned that she hails from Jalaun and had been living in a hostel in Jhansi to pursue her studies. She came in contact with Swajan when he was posted in Jalaun as SDM and they became friends. The SDM became intimate with her on the promise of marriage. Later, she came to know that the SDM was already married and even had two children. The woman then lodged a complaint against Swajan accusing him of raping her on the false promise of marriage while concealing the fact that he is already married. During preliminary investigations, the allegations were found true and Swajan was suspended in September 2019. He was absconding since then with no one knowing his whereabouts. Investigating officer Anil Kumar Singh said the charges levelled against the accused by the victim were found true during investigations and he has surrendered in the court on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sdm-accused-of-rape-surrenders-in-jhansi-court/articleshow/82056283.cms||---

To cut waiting time, the crematoriums have shun indoor furnaces and are opting the open premises to cremate bodies in wooden furnaces. There are two crematoriums in Jamnagar city — Sonapuri and Gandhinagar. The one in Sonapuri is the biggest and the oldest of the two and as per data it is cremating 35 bodies in a day of which almost 18 to 20 are Covid victims. There is one electric and one gas-based furnace in Sonapuri crematorium besides five wooden-based furnaces which were not in use fo the past few years. However, now the crematorium is using these wooden furnaces to reduce the waiting period. Trustee of the Sonapuri crematorium, Deepak Thakkar said, “We got 22 Covid bodies to cremate on Monday. The electric and gas furnaces need a cooling period of at least five hours in a day but looking at the current situation we don’t get that much window period.” There is heavy rush of Covid patients from Morbi, Rajkot, Junagadh and Amreli district into Jamnagar. According to Covid protocol, Covid victims have to be cremated in the same city where they succumb. This has led to increased burden on the crematoriums.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/now-crematoriums-bearing-covid-brunt/articleshow/82054518.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Drug regulator nod to import, make Russian vax Sputnik V||HYDERABAD: Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd on Tuesday said it has received permission from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) to import Sputnik V vaccine into India under the emergency use authorisation (EUA) norms. After the subject expert committee (SEC) recommended EUA approval for the Sputnik V on Monday, the DCGI gave its nod late on Monday night, sources said. The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) also tweeted that India’s drug regulator had found that “safety and immunogenicity data from a local trial of Sputnik V is comparable to that of a late-stage trial done in Russia”. The vaccine had demonstrated an efficacy rate of 91.6% in interim analysis data of the phase III global clinical trials published in British medical journal Lancet. A Dr Reddy's spokesperson said that the company’s contract with RDIF is for 250 million doses, which is enough to vaccinate 125 million people. A top Dr Reddy’s official had earlier said that though it has entered into a contract with a local player to make enough doses to vaccinate 125 million people, which is 9% of the Indian population, it will be distributing vaccines imported from Russia in the initial phases. Sources said that apart from the clinical trials and marketing authorisation for distributing and marketing the vaccine in India, Dr Reddy’s will also be taking care of the regulatory, safety and pharmaco-vigilance aspects of the vaccine in India, sources added. Dr Reddy’s Laboratories co-chairman and managing director GV Prasad said, “With the rising cases in India, vaccination is the most effective tool in our battle against Covid-19. This will enable us to contribute to our nation’s effort of vaccinating a significant proportion of our population.” However, there is no clarity yet on the pricing of Sputnik V in India. While RDIF has been selling the vaccine at $10 per dose in international markets, the Indian government has capped the prices of Covid-19 vaccines at Rs 150 per dose ($2). RDIF has tied up with five manufacturers in India – Gland Pharma (252 million doses), Virchow Biotech (200m), Stelis Biopharma (200m) Panacea Biotech (100m) and Hetero Biopharma (100m) – to manufacture around 852 million doses, of which 426 million are slated for use in India. In September 2020, Dr Reddy’s had partnered with RDIF, to conduct the clinical trials of Sputnik V and distribute it in India and carried out phase II and III trials on 1,600 volunteers as a bridging study to the larger trials conducted in Russia. The Russian vaccine is now approved for use in 60 countries around the world with a total population of 3 billion people and ranks second among Covid-19 vaccines globally in terms of the number of approvals issued by government regulators, RDIF & Dr Reddy’s said. The world’s first Covid-19 vaccine to be registered in August 2020, Sputnik V uses two human adenoviral vectors– adenovirus 26 (Ad26) and adenovirus 5 (Ad5) – that are administered 21 days apart.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/drug-regulator-nod-to-import-make-russian-vax-sputnik-v/articleshow/82057003.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Oxygen, ICU beds get scarce in private hospitals||HYDERABAD: With a drastic increase in hospitalisation as a result of a five-fold spike in Covid-19 infections over the last 12 days, the city is now running short of oxygen and ICU beds. There have been several instances of patients doing four to five rounds of hospitals and being turned away from each of them. “We tried all big hospitals within a 15-kilometre-radius around my house but not a single ICU bed was available. After taking every possible avenue and reaching out to all possible contacts, we had to admit my sister-in-law to a government hospital which seemed like the last option available. After two days, we shifted her to a private hospital where we found a bed,” said Srikanth Naik, family member of a Covid-19 patient. As per a complaint to state health department, one patient had tired seven different hospitals and finally got a bed after submitting a Rs 1 lakh as a security amount. Currently, 26 per cent of Covid-19 beds in government hospitals are occupied while private hospitals have 45 per cent of Covid-19 beds occupied. The situation in private and corporate hospitals in and around Hyderabad is concerning with prior bookings often essential for securing oxygen beds. “We have allotted 200 critical care beds and 40 ventilators, of the total 600 Covid-19 beds but the daily turnover of patients is much more. This is leading to a perpetual shortage of beds for patients on ventilators and oxygen beds. Regular beds with oxygen supply are available if we can book it beforehand,” said Neeraj Lal, senior vice president, operations, Medicover group of hospitals. The situation is similar across private hospitals admitted Dr Bhaskar Rao, president of the Telangana Super Speciality Hospitals Association. This, due to the exponential increase in cases over the three weeks. Beds in government hospitals are available but many, as was the case during the first wave, are seeking treatment at private hospitals. “I have had to redirect a few patients to the government hospitals after trying to find a bed for them at every possible place I knew. Once again, we are seeing the people’s hesitancy coming in way of seeking treatment at government hospitals. Be it the private or the government infrastructure, we seem to have learnt no lessons from the first wave. We are exactly in the same situation even now,” said Dr Sanjeev Singh Yadav, national secretary for Indian Medical Association’s Academy of Medical Specialities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/oxygen-icu-beds-get-scarce-in-pvt-hosps/articleshow/82055443.cms||Amrita Didyala

The state health department reported 14 deaths while four died at NMCH and two at AIIMS-Patna. Apart from the sharp spike in deaths and fresh cases, Bihar’s recovery rate has also plunged steeply over the past few days. In fact, it has plunged by 6.30% in the last fortnight. The state’s Covid recovery rate plunged from 98.81% on March 31 to 92.50% on Tuesday. Nevertheless, the state recovery rate is still 2.96% higher than the national recovery rate of 92.50% on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Patna continued to register the highest daily caseload in Bihar with 1,205 people found infected with the virus in the last 24 hours. Bhagalpur had the second highest number of cases at 346, followed by Gaya (250), Muzaffarpur (218), Jehanabad (175), Saran (171) and Saharsa (111). Meanwhile, altogether 1,047 persons recovered from the infection in the last 24 hours, taking the tally for cured persons in the state to 2,68,606.

---||Hyderabad||80% of Old Hyderabad households lost property, jobs due to Covid-19 & floods, finds survey||HYDERABAD: A pre-Ramzan survey in parts of Old City shows that Covid-19, coupled with recent floods, has hit the poor and lower middle classes hard. The survey was carried out by a non-governmental organisation, Helping Hand Foundation, covering 7,200 households spread over 20 different localities in the Old City. It showed that 80% of households reported loss of property, jobs and wages. Their health condition was also affected badly with a heavy dent in their income. “Many have slipped into abject poverty. One in three schoolchildren dropped out of school to make an earning. About 30% of blue-collar factory workers have turned daily wagers as their factories closed. About 70% of habitants reported lack of access to good and affordable healthcare,” the survey report released on the eve of Ramzan, on Tuesday, said. It also revealed that 40% of adults above 35 were suffering from hypertension. The survey revealed how domestic life was affected by Covid-19 among poor families, with 26% of women surveyed being single. Many of them were abandoned by their husbands post lockdown. A significant number of families did not have adequate documentation to avail welfare schemes. About 100 families resorted to begging. “One of the most obvious and painful findings was that 33% of students aged between 10 and 17 years dropped out of school to supplement the household income of their families by taking up daily wage jobs like assisting pushcart vendors, and helpers in hotels and mechanic shops," said Helping Hand Foundation managing trustee Mujtaba Hasan Askari. In view of closure of abattoirs as well as garment, zari and embroidery works, and mechanical equipment factories due to the lockdown, families living in areas such as Barkas, Shaheenagar, and Salalah lost their livelihood. Many were forced to take up daily labour, the survey report said. About 25% of women, whose household income has stopped due to closure of small trade, are working as maids on meagre salaries of Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000 per month. Younger women with young children are struggling to find jobs in nearby areas as they cannot travel long distance for work, the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/80-of-old-city-households-lost-property-jobs-due-to-covid-19-floods-finds-survey/articleshow/82055525.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Hyderabad||Discovering the world of online learning||By Sujatha Rao I had been planning on exploring online courses for a while, but I kept postponing it for some reason or the other. Stuck in the house with a raging pandemic outside last year, I finally ran out of reasons or rather excuses. That’s when I willy-nilly registered myself on the online platforms and started to browse through courses. Given the feeling of doom and gloom within and around me, I chose ‘A Life of Happiness and Fulfillment’, offered by ISB, as my first course of learning. By the time I finished this six-week module -- advocating that one adapts seven habits, while avoiding seven sins -- I got hooked. But while I found myself happier, I wasn’t fulfilled. I grew hungry for more. Soon thereafter, I came across this extremely popular course with an enrollment of 3.3 million people titled ‘The Science of Well-Being’ and went for it. There has been no looking back since then. Till date, I have completed 13 online courses, picking each one of my choices out of the veritable available options, with many of them being offered for free. Not only did I chug through the deadlines, peer graded assignments week after week, and month after month, I also went ahead and read quite a few optional books and materials recommended within these courses. My physical as well as mental health took a turn for the better. And even while being stuck at home, I found myself sticking to a daily schedule. These Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have changed my life for the better. An earlier skeptic about online learning, I am proud to say that I stand converted. Though I still enjoy the face-to-face learning opportunity more, I now understand the value of the world class online learning opportunity from the reputed universities. Right now, it is like a dream come true for me to be learning about the financial markets from a Nobel Laureate, sitting in the close comfort of my home. It’s true that in the present age of internet, knowledge is right at the fingertips of those who are willing to learn. So, while I wear a mask and regularly wash my hands to protect myself from the Covid-19 virus, I don’t wish to get debugged from the ‘bytes’ of this learning ‘bug’.

The church got sense of the ground reality after Easter when priests visit parishioners to bless their homes. “Many families asked the priest not to visit them as many had coronavirus cases in their homes,” a parishioner said. “The church has decided to take a small break so that it doesn’t become a transmitter of Covid. Despite sanitisation and following all SOPs, there is fear as the church is centrally located with Covid hotspots Candolim and Calangute nearby,” the parishioner said, adding that coronavirus cases have been detected in four wards in Saligao. The church receives bus loads of tourists and is apprehensive about tourists from hotspot areas infecting locals. “They don’t disturb us but we are concerned about transmission as cases are out of control in neighbouring states,” the parishioner said. In a notice, the church stated that Masses will be celebrated privately for the intentions of the day and has urged faithful to stay safe, wear masks and follow SOPs. “Precaution is better than cure. True prevention is not waiting for bad things to happen, it’s preventing things from happening in the first place…” the church stated, appealing to the faithful to understand the situation at hand. The archdiocese, during the pandemic, has instructed each parish to strictly follow SOPs and made each parish priest responsible for taking decisions according to the situation at hand to ensure the safety of its people. The church has decided it will restart Masses in a small way with stricter SOPs, with spray as well as liquid sanitisers and fumigate the church between services. It is also hoping to be able to celebrate the novena of the patron saint beginning April 22 followed by the feast on May 2. Parishioners were unable to celebrate the occasion last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/saligao-church-temporarily-suspends-services-for-public/articleshow/82056340.cms||---

Interrogation of the accused revealed that one more doctor was allegedly involved in the black marketing of the drug. The cops on Tuesday questioned Dr Mitesh Thakkar, who worked at a Covid care centre in a private hospital in Fatehgunj. “We are questioning Thakkar as one of the accused Krunal Patel said that he had sourced the drug from him. Thakkar being a doctor had access to remdesivir drug,” said V P Gamit, ACP who is supervising the investigations. The police said that the names of many more persons may surface in the illegal selling of remdesivir. City police commissioner Shamsher Singh said that remdesivir stock meant to be exported by a company was diverted illegally to the local market. “We have written to the food and drugs commissioner and sought help in investigating as to how the export-oriented stock made its way to the local market. They are also involved in the investigation now,” Singh told TOI. Singh added that the accused also got hold of remdesivir by tampering with the medical prescription by involving persons from the medical fraternity. The police on Tuesday produced prime accused Dr Dhiren Nagora and Rahul Valand before a local court. While Nagora was remanded to three days police custody, Valand was sent to four days in police custody. “It is a widespread racket and hence we have formed four more teams to investigate it in detail,” Singh said. Both special operations group (SOG) and prevention of crime branch (PCB) teams are investigating the case separately. The police said that the gang also used to buy the drugs on the black market and then sell it at even higher price to the needy. PCB had busted the racket on Sunday after it arrested Nagora by setting a trap. The cops had sent a decoy customer to buy remdesivir from Nagora after fixing a meeting with him in Raopura.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/one-more-doctor-involved-in-racket/articleshow/82054766.cms||---

This year too, Telangana will not be deficient in rainfall as the prediction is that it will receive normal to above normal rains,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet. As per the Skymet forecast, Telangana will receive good amount of rainfall during August, 2021. Overall, the upcoming monsoon in the country is expected to be ‘healthy normal,’ to the tune of 103 per cent (with an error margin of +/- 5%) of the long period average (LPA) of 880.6 mm for the four-month period from June to September. However, despite the local weather office predicting pre-monsoon showers in Hyderabad, the city experienced only a slight drizzle. There wasn’t much precipitation despite overcast conditions. “La Nina conditions prevailing over Pacific Ocean since last year. Presage softening is expected to remain neutral through the monsoon season. ENSO continues to wield a spike mid-way through the season suggesting fresh phase of cooling, albeit marginal, over the Central Pacific ocean. Therefore, occurrence of El Nino which normally corrupts the monsoon is ruled out,” said Skymet chief executive officer, Yogesh Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/normal-monsoon-in-t-predicts-skymet/articleshow/82055688.cms||---

Her son wished somebody came home and collected her swab sample for RT-PCR test to confirm Covid-19 infection but all the three private labs he contacted for the purpose refused to carry out the test at all. Let alone home collection of samples, which was common till very recently, the private labs are not carrying out RT PCR tests at all, ever since the administration put a cap of Rs 700 for each test with Rs 200 extra in case the sample is collected from home. Earlier, the test was being carried out for Rs 1100. “I had come to know from my friends that samples for RT-PCR tests are collected from home and they also gave me phone nos. of three path labs, where I could get the test done but all of them refused”, said Vaibhav Tiwari, his son. When TOI contacted some private pathology labs to find out why they have stopped taking samples for RT-PCR test and does it have anything to do with the state government capping the rate for RT-PCR test to Rs 700, they told very different reasons as to why they are not taking samples for RT-PCR test. While Rahul Singh of Rahul Home Collection Lab said that for the last few days, samples for RT-PCR test are not being collected because the stock of VTM kit they use to take the samples has exhausted. “The kit comes from Mumbai. The new stock is expected to arrive today. But, till it happens, we can’t take samples”. He categorically said that the private labs are not refusing to take samples for RT PCR test because of the price cap put on it. “No, no. In this situation, we shall not do it for money. We don’t have the kits, how can we collect samples?”, he said. On the other hand, Pawan, who runs a collection centre for Mumbai-based path lab which has collection centres all over the country, narrated a very different story why the sample collection for RT-PCR test was stopped. “We used to send 500 to 600 samples daily to Mumbai for testing till recently but it had to be stopped because registration of collection centres with the CMHO office has been made mandatory. The process of registration is on but till that happens, we can’t send samples for testing to Mumbai, our headquarters”, he said. He, too, said that discontinuation of sample collection for RT-PCR has nothing to do with the cap on the rates imposed by the state government. District collector, Avinash Lavania, seemed to be unaware of any procedural problem hindering RT-PCR tests in Bhopal as he said “We can’t ask all the private labs to take samples. If some of them feel the rates decided by the administration are not financially viable, they stop testing. But, we have 62 fever clinics doing free sampling, people can go there and get themselves tested.” When asked that home collection was an easy way for people, who are old and infirm or those who may not be able to go to a fever clinic because of illness, he said “ Not all the private labs have stopped doing sample collection for RT-PCR tests. There may be some, which were not doing it earlier as well or may have stopped home collection. But, I know at least 35 private labs in the city are doing it and we receive reports from them on a daily basis.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/price-cap-effect-pvt-labs-refuse-sampling/articleshow/82054898.cms||Ashutosh Shukla
---||Hyderabad||Heavenly touch to Hyderabad’s iconic monuments, stars were guides||HYDERABAD: What do constellations Orion, Ursa Minor and Scorpius have in common with monuments such as Mecca Masjid, Jama Masjid, Charminar, Qutb Shahi tombs and Falaknuma? A new observational work by a scion of the Paigah family reveals that the Qutb Shahis had built monuments in alignment with the constellations, particularly those related to their birth star or the name of their tribe, while the Paigahs built Falaknama in the shape of Scorpius constellation to complete the celestial alignment of ancient structures in the Old City. The work by heritage expert Mohammad Habib, a member of the Paigah family, the second most powerful family after the Nizam’s in the erstwhile princely state of Hyderabad, gains significance in the backdrop of an international work showing that the pyramids of Egypt were built in alignment with celestial bodies. Habib, who is also documenting heritage monuments of Hyderabad through his photography, told TOI that the pyramids are not the only structures that align with certain heavenly bodies. “We too have similar monuments in Hyderabad,” he points out. “When we speak of the Orion constellation about ancient heritage structures, the first thought that comes to mind is that of the Giza pyramids. But back home in Hyderabad, we have several structures that are in alignment with the Orion and other constellations,” Habib said. According to Habib, the Qutb Shahi tombs were built in correlation with the Ursa Minor constellation. Other three iconic structures of Hyderabad — Jama Masjid, Charminar and Mecca Masjid — are in direct correlation with the three stars from east to west — Alnitak (Zeta Orionis), Alnilam (Epsilon Orionis) and Mintaka (Delta Orionis) — also known as ‘The Three Kings’ that traditionally make up the ‘Belt of Orion’. The alignment of the stars in the heaven are similar to the alignment of monuments in Hyderabad. Stating that historically Orion is linked to Scorpius, Habib said Falaknuma Palace, which is located at a distance from Mecca Masjid, represents the constellation Scorpius. “This is where the mystery behind the scorpion-shaped palace we know as Falaknuma unfolds. Paigah Amir Nawab Sir Viqar-ul-Umrah Bahadur was a prolific builder who wanted his palaces to be architectural masterpieces reflecting the grandeur of his vision. He very well understood the correlation of the three Qutb Shahi structures with the Orion and that is why he hired the two Italian architects, Oselio Bronowic and Misowalic, to build Falaknuma Palace in the shape of a scorpion, representing this celestial legend on earth,” Habib pointed out. The Qutb Shahis were of Persian descent, but in early Arabia, Orion was called ‘Al Jauzah’, a term that was used for black sheep with a white spot in the middle of its body. Sultan Quli’s lineage emanated from the Turkoman tribe of Qara Quyunlu, which also had the emblem of black sheep in its flag. “It may well be possible that the three iconic structures together represent the emblem of the Qara Quyunlu tribe,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/heavenly-touch-to-citys-iconic-monuments-stars-were-guides/articleshow/82057006.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Hyderabad||Singing my way through tough times||By Sandilya Kasinadhuni Initially, the lockdown was difficult to handle. The fact that we could not step out of home to hit hard. But as time went by, two major positives started to emerge. Firstly, I started spending quality time with my family, which was earlier rare due to my job obligations. I understood the importance of family bonding and values. We always say family comes first but due to work pressure and other added baggage, somewhere down the line, we tend to forget it. Though we are a very big family with many cousins, we hardly spoke to each other prior to the lockdown. But as we found ourselves stuck at home, I realised I had more time to connect with them. It was a wonderful experience and it felt really good sharing stories of the lockdown and what each one of them were doing at home. It was heartening to know that some of my friends had become master chefs and were experimenting with food like never before! Secondly, the lockdown bought out the singer in me who had been wandering in unknown territories for a while. I started with my journey on March 23, 2020 with an online event – Ecstasy: A treasure trove for music lovers -- being its tagline. Since then, I have sung more than 600 songs of Kishore Kumar, Mohd Rafi, Kumar Sanu, Udit Narayan and Sonu Nigam. Apart from enthralling listeners with music, I also use my event to spread awareness about the need to sanitise, wear a mask (whenever we go out) and follow government guidelines to ensure that we stay safe and allow others to be safe through us. This event has been an extremely fulfilling experience for me. The response has been overwhelming and I have been able to engage with a lot of people – including my friends from college – through it. I also sang live on Playtoome -- an online platform for singers -- where the audience needed to purchase a ticket to watch my show. That brought out the professional side in me. It was a great experience for me and my family.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Jaleel had Pinarayi’s trust, not party’s||Thiruvananthapuram: K T Jaleel was a trusted lieutenant of Pinarayi Vijayan and he enjoyed the latter’s support all along the turbulent times he had while facing a series of allegations once he became a minister in the Pinarayi cabinet. It was quite a surprise for even the party circles when Vijayan, the then party secretary, chose Jaleel to accompany him in the Nava Kerala Yatra in 2009. Apart from Jaleel, who was not even a primary member of the CPM, the members who accompanied Vijayan in the yatra were A Vijayargahavan, E P Jayarajan, M V Govindan and T N Seema two central committee and two state committee members. Following his ouster from IUML in 2005 after serious differences with the party leader, P K Kunhalikutty, the CPM gave him a ticket to contest in 2006 as an independent. He trounced Kunhalikutty himself in the election and later became the Muslim face of the CPM in Malappuram. He repeated his victories for the CPM in 2011 and 2016 too. Vijayan believed that the entry of Jaleel helped the party gain roots in the district. Vijayan sprung another surprise in 2016 when Jaleel was inducted into his cabinet much to the dismay of the party leaders and cadres. Though Jaleel was first given the LSG portfolio, he was later made the higher education minister by bifurcating the education portfolio. Usually CPM members are chosen to head the education ministry when LDF comes to power and in Jaleel’s case that convention was broken and a non-CPM member had for the first time handled the key ministry of higher education. Even in the 2021 assembly election, when several ministers and MLAs lost their chance to contest due to the two-term barrier, it was not applicable for Jaleel. Vijayan was also vociferous in defending Jaleel both inside and outside the assembly whenever he ran into controversies. Be it the mark awarding issue or the import of Quran, the chief minister stood by him. Even his resignation was ruled out when he was questioned by ED on the import of Quran through UAE consulate violating the protocols. However, when the Lok Ayukta order demanded the ouster of Jaleel from the cabinet, the party decided to act. It was only law minister A K Balan who came forward to support Jaleel. But CPM politburo member M A Baby soon corrected Balan and said the party has not taken any such decision. Baby even went on to say that Jaleel has approached the high court against the Lok Ayukta order on his own interest and the party has nothing to do with it. This proved beyond doubt that the party is not happy with Jaleel continuing in the cabinet. The think-tanks in the party, including S Ramachandran Pillai, Kodiyeri Balakrishnan and M A Baby, are learnt to have spoken to the chief minister on this. It was after their discussion that the party decided to seek Jaleel’s resignation. The party’s message was conveyed to him by Balakrishnan on Tuesday morning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/jaleel-had-pinarayis-trust-not-partys/articleshow/82055429.cms||---

He said the MVA government here was taking several measures to stem the spread of the virus but other states had failed to take proper steps to control Covid-19 and people coming from there were bringing it with them. Raut pointed to crowding at the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar and the participation of lakhs in poll rallies in West Bengal. “Compared to those states, more measures have been taken by the state and rules are followed by the people in Maharashtra,” he said. “The government and administration are trying to control the situation here and Maharashtra’s health-care system is the best in the country. CM Uddhav Thackeray has put restrictions even on Gudi Padwa celebrations. Other states should put some restrictions for a month or two.” He said the behaviour of other states was an invitation to a national lockdown. Raut sarcastically wished leader of the opposition in the assembly Devendra Fadnavis best of luck a day after asked the people of Pandharpur to vote in the by-election and leave the change of government in the state to him. On the 24-hour campaign ban imposed on West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee following public statements that were held to have incited violence, Raut said the decision raised a question mark over democracy and the Election Commission. “She is getting support from the people,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-raut-blames-other-states-for-covid-spike/articleshow/82056344.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Nagpur||Examine feasibility of beds at Mankapur indoor stadium & NNSR: HC to collector||Nagpur: Alarmed over reports of a beds shortage for Covid-19 patients, the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court on Tuesday directed collector to examine feasibility and submit reports on making them available at Mankapur indoor stadium and Nagpur Nagrik Sahakari Rugnalaya (NNSR) which is in a defunct state. A division bench comprising justices Zaka Haq and Amit Borkar orally pointed out that there is lack of coordination between the state government and NMC and work done by the former is far better than latter to fight the pandemic. After amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar pointed out that two railway hospitals with infrastructure like oxygen supply and ventilators, are under-utilized and those facilities can be made available to the needy patients, the bench asked assistant solicitor general Ulhas Aurangabadkar to discuss the issue with concerned authorities. “We hope and trust that the railways will cooperate with the collector and other concerned authorities so that the facility can be utilized to its optimum for patients,” the judges said before adjourning the hearing till April 20. Earlier, collector Ravindra Thakare through senior counsel MG Bhangde assured to start a centralized portal for monitoring the supply and administration of Remdesvir injection. It would have patient names with details of their Aadhaar number, name of hospital where they’re admitted and doses administered. The hospitals will have to ensure that the required data is updated on the centralized portal immediately as soon as the doses are given to the patients. If a patient is unable to get a bed like in current situation, but still require Remdesvir, the dedicated hospitals treating them can administer it in their outdoor patient department (OPD) and update details on the portal. “If patient fails to get a bed in a dedicated hospital and wasn’t able to get Remdesvir in OPD, the respective collectors should ensure that they get injections if recommended by their doctor from non-dedicated hospitals. Such patients shouldn’t be denied the injections only on the ground they were being treated at non-dedicated hospitals. In such cases, the doctor (having minimum MBBS degree) will have to certify in the prescribed format with all necessary reports,” the bench said. On shortage of Tocilizumab injections, the government informed that it was imported and its distribution and supply was regulated by the central government. The judges then directed FDA joint commissioner to seek all details about Tocilizumab from Nagpur depot of Cipla Pharmaceuticals. He was also told to collect data from pharmacists on its supply from the depot or company’s agent. “The depot manager and pharmacists shall furnish all the details regarding transactions from March 1 to FDA within two hours of receipt of the notice. If anyone refuses to give details, the FDA should take strict action. The Tocilizumab availability with the pharmacists shall be uploaded on the centralized portal,” the HC said. What HC said: * Lack of coordination between government & NMC * Work done by govt better than NMC to fight pandemic * Railway should interact with collector to utilize its hospitals * Collector to ensure patients get injections in non-dedicated hospitals * MBBS doctors to certify patients in prescribed format in such cases * FDA to collect all details of Tocilizumab from Nagpur Depot of Cipla||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/examine-feasibility-of-beds-at-mankapur-indoor-stadium-nnsr-hc-to-collector/articleshow/82055454.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Mumbai||In Dr Ambedkar’s footsteps on power reforms||Dr B R Ambedkar’s 130th birth anniversary is being celebrated today. The architect of the Constitution also did outstanding work in shaping the power sector in India. As minister in the Viceroy’s Cabinet (1942-1946), he handled portfolios of labour, water resources departments and power.In his thoughts on agriculture in ‘Small Holdings in India and Their Remedies’ (1917) and ‘States and Minorities’ (1947), he stated holding of lands by a few people was an acute problem. He suggested collective farming, economic holding of land or its equal distribution, industrialization, provision of credit, water, seeds and fertilizers by government, cultivation of wastelands by allotting wastelands to landless labour, minimum wages to labourers, control and regulation of private lenders. Abolition of the ‘Khoti’ system (1949) ‘Mahar Vatan’ (1959) and introduction of Bombay Money Lenders’ Bill (1938) stand out as success stories of Dr Ambedkar’s movement. Agricultural growth rate is now not only stagnant but indicates declining trends. The government has concentrated on technical problems and ignored institutional ones. Distribution of land ownership is the obstacle. There is a need to take measures on the basis of Dr Ambedkar’s thoughts. Dr Ambedkar propounds the concept of state socialism. With abolition of intermediaries, the State must be owner of land. It should distribute lands to farms. Farmers should cultivate collectively. The State should supply essential capital to agri sector, and income thus obtained must be distributed among farmers. In Dr Ambedkar’s view, capital arises from savings and that is possible where there is surplus. No surplus is possible in India because in spite of the vastness of land under cultivation, a large agri population with the lowest proportion of land in actual cultivation meant this part remained idle. This creates pressure on land. The government must adopt co-operative agriculture to increase size of holdings. Following Dr Ambedkar’s footprints, I am trying to provide the cheapest power to consumers. By making sparing use of resources, with modern tools and by bringing in transparency in governance and taking all stakeholders into confidence, I would be successful. My priority has been to provide adequate quality power to all, including the agri sector, in daytime. MahaDiscom provides power to more than 42 lakh agri consumers. Our department recently formulated the Renewable Energy Policy 2020 through which farmers would be given adequate green power in daytime. For this, solar pumps at the rate of 1 lakh per annum would be provided. Secondly, after 2018 (BJP regime) there was no scheme to provide power to farmers. The department has recently notified Agriculture Policy 2020 under which lakhs would be provided power. Thirdly, relief to agri consumers is given by writing off DPC (delayed payment charges), interest and reducing outstanding power bills to the extent of 66% on paying current bills. To reduce tariff burden, the department has undertaken initiatives like monetisation of assets like lands, lines, managing coal and ash handling plants efficiently, generation of surplus from ash, cost cutting etc. Such efforts would lead to overall reduction in tariffs. I am also reviewing performance of subsidiaries. The first initiative would be to revamp MoAs and AoAs of MSEB Holding Co Ltd (MSEBHCL) and its subsidiaries. Also, I am thinking of dividing Asia’s second largest MahaDiscom into regional distribution companies. This would be done in consultation with all stakeholders.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: ISB gets consumer court rap, told to restore email, alumni link to ex-student||HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad district consumer forum found fault with top B-school, Indian School of Business (ISB), for denying access to its official email ID and its 25,000-strong alumni network to one of its former students. The forum directed ISB to restore the official email ID to the student so that he could connect with the alumni network as that was one of the perks offered at the time of inviting applications from aspiring students. Stating that the alumni was the biggest source of strength for those completing management programmes at ISB, V Naveen Kumar approached the forum questioning the management’s decision to not provide him access. He studied public policy at the Hyderabad campus, spending Rs 16 lakh in 2018. He was given an official email address with which he could use the facilities, including access the alumni network. “After my course was over, I did not get any employment offer for three years. Added to this, I was stripped of access to the network,” Naveen told the forum. The ISB counsel argued that the forum could not adjudicate the case as educational institutions do not fall under the purview of the Consumer Protection Act. He also alleged that Naveen was found misusing the official email ID by writing frequent emails to directors of ISB. According to the counsel, he was also defaming the school in his email communications sent to various business partners connected to the school. The petitioner refuted the charges saying he never sent such emails to anyone. The bench, comprising its president Vakkanti Narasimha Rao and members PVTR Jawahar Babu and R S Rajeshree, said ISB was not an educational institute to claim immunity from consumer laws. It is a registered company and hence falls under the purview of the consumer forum, the bench said. The bench also sought proof from the ISB counsel for his allegations against the ex-student. It later pointed out that the alleged emails were not conclusively connected to Naveen. “There is no proof placed before us that these emails were sent by him. Nor was there any proof to show that they had warned him in the past not to misuse the official email,” the bench said and gave a finding that the action of the ISB management in blocking Naveen’s email was not proper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/isb-gets-consumer-court-rap-told-to-restore-email-alumni-link-to-ex-student/articleshow/82057010.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The government must ensure availability of ventilators, Remdesivir, oxygen, and oxygenated beds as well as regular beds to ensure patients do not have to struggle, he said. Fadnavis said the Rs 3,300 crore which the chief minister has said will be kept aside for Covid preparedness should not remain a mere announcement but be used immediately to procur beds and other medical equipment and the government must give express permission for its utilisation. “The chief minister has considered only certain sections of society but a vast majority has not been offered any help. These include small traders, shopkeepers, salons and flower vendors. No help has been offered to them. The government must take an immediate decision to include all of them as eligible for aid,” he said.

Officials seized gold ornaments weighing 535g and 77 documents apart from around Rs 30,000. On Monday, VACB had seized Rs 47,35,500 from Shaji’s house at Manalil in Kannur. Though vigilance seized some foreign currency from his house at Maloorkunnu in Kozhikode, they handed it back after including it in the mahazar after Shaji said that the currency was part of the collection of his children. VACB had conducted simultaneous raids at his homes in Kozhikode and Kannur on Monday in connection with the case that he had amassed wealth disproportionate to his known and legal sources of income. After the raids on Monday, Shaji said that he had documents to prove the source of the money seized from his residence and that he was ready to produce it before any investigation agency. VACB had registered a case against the MLA after preliminary inquiry found that Shaji had amassed wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income from 2011 to 2020 by a margin of 166%. The inquiry was made on the basis of a petition filed by advocate MR Harish before the court of enquiry commissioner and special judge, Kozhikode. Meanwhile, the court of enquiry commissioner and special judge, Kozhikode has postponed the hearing of the case against Shaji, which was scheduled on Tuesday, to April 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/gold-docs-seized-from-mlas-home/articleshow/82055441.cms||---
---||Pune||Big units told to up quarantine facility||Pune: The Khed tehsil administration has directed companies with 500 or more employees in Khed and Chakan MIDC areas to set up quarantine facilities for their employees awaiting RT-PCR test reports on campus. Tehsil health officer Dr BB Gadve said, “Due to increase in number of tests, it’s taking 2-3 days for sample results. There is high possibility that some asymptomatic Covid-19 employees awaiting their test results may mingle with other employees and spread the virus. To avoid this, we have asked companies to plan an apt strategy to test their employees, which would help avert crowding at rural hospitals and primary health centers and set up quarantine facilities for those awaiting results.” Dilip Batwal, secretary of Federation of Chakan Industry, said, “Big companies have created their facilities and they also have a dedicated medical team on campus. The issue is with small-scale industries as they have asked their employees to get their RTPCR tests done at private labs. However, these labs are giving test results only after 2-3 days. Until then, employees are interacting with other populace not only at the company but also in their residential localities. As a result, the test results of employees should be given early.” Many big automobile companies and other industrial units first carry out their employees’ rapid antigen tests. “If someone tests positive, he would either be isolated immediately at our facility or at home. This person won’t report to work until s/he submits a Covid-19 negative certificate,” said a senior official from an automobile company based in Chakan MIDC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/big-units-told-to-up-quarantine-facility/articleshow/82056355.cms||Sandip Dighe

In Sagar district’s Bina itself, five patients escaped from an isolation centre. Five contract workers of a refinery were isolated on the third floor of a building in Bina on Monday. They were being treated under isolation. On Monday morning, when the health workers reached the quarantine centre, they found the labourers missing. The SHO of Bina Kamal Nigwal told local media that police were trying to locate the labourers. Their mobile phones were found switched off. Doctors treating the labourers appealed to them through the local media to quarantine themselves or they would infect others as well. Meanwhile, in Buxwah town of Chhatarpur district, a 70-year-old Covid-19 patient has been missing. He was declared positive on April 10 and was admitted at a local hospital. Now the administration is looking for him but the phone number provided by him turned out to be fake. “It appears that the personal details provided by the man while his swab samples were being collected were false. Those who had taken the sample did not cross check them through the Aadhaar card,” a local official said. On Tuesday, 163 cases of Covid-19 were reported from Chhattarpur while 188 cases were reported from Sagar district. Another Covid-19 patient, who was admitted at a local hospital, went missing in Porsa town of Morena.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/over-last-24-hrs-7-covid-patients-jump-quarantine/articleshow/82054922.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||India has only one species of gibbons, not two, finds CCMB||HYDERABAD: India has only one species of Hoolock gibbons and not two. Hoolock gibbons are small apes and the only apes present in India. A research study by city-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) has debunked the popular notion that there are two species of gibbons in India. The confusion arose earlier as these small apes present in the northeast have populations with different physical features though they are of the same species. CCMB scientists said the gibbon species present in the country is Hoolock Hoolock. The other species, Hoolock leuconedys, is not present in India. “Physically different two populations of Hoolock gibbons are found in Arunachal Pradesh. Those found in Mishmi Hills of eastern Arunachal Pradesh were thought to be a species from Myanmar. Recent genetic analysis shows that Hoolock gibbons in India belong to only one species, the Western Hoolock gibbons. This helps design conservation programmes by inter-breeding the two populations and maintain their genetic diversity,” the CCMB study said. The study was published in the International Journal of Primatology on April 8. The research team was led by Govindhaswamy Umapathy. The other team members are Mihir Trivedi, Shivakumara Manu, Sanjaay Balakrishnan, Jihosuo Biswas and NVK Asharaf. The researchers said India is reported to have one species of Hoolock gibbon, but a recent study based on pelage (fur) colour suggested that another species,Hoolock leuconedys, occurs in the Mishmi Hills between Dibang and Nao Dehing rivers in Arunachal Pradesh. “We examined whether Hoolock leuconedys occurs in India and its evolutionary relationships with other Hylobatidae (gibbon family) species. We collected blood, tissue and faecal samples from various populations of Hoolock Hoolock and the Mishmi Hills gibbons from their distribution in northeast India, zoos and rescues centres. We isolated DNA from these samples and constructed phylogenetic trees. We also performed whole mitochondrial analysis to study the phylogenetics of the gibbon family,” the researchers said. The genetic analysis revealed that none of the samples from India was Hoolock leuconedys, and that all samples from the Mishmi Hills could be assigned to Hoolock Hoolock. Later, the team corroborated the data with mitogenome (genetic information contained in mitochondria) analysis. The CCMB team estimated that the “gibbon divergence from a common ancestor occurred 8.38 million years ago and that the split between Hoolock Hoolock and Hoolock leuconedys occurred 1.49 million years ago”. They said the new findings will facilitate exchange of gibbons from different zoos for captive breeding programmes and the conservation and management of these small apes living in the wild.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/india-has-only-one-species-of-gibbons-not-two-finds-ccmb/articleshow/82057013.cms||Syed Akbar

The 1998 French World Cup-winning centre-back is now coach of Al Rayyan SC. Up against debutants FC Goa in the AFC Champions League, this should have been easy points in the opening game for the Qatar giants. That’s what everyone thought. Instead, Goa put on a show that was hardly believable with a fighting goalless draw at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Wednesday. Goa enjoyed a 15-game unbeaten run in the Indian Super League (ISL) which concluded last month. Now, in the high-profile league where Asia’s elite compete for top honours, Juan Ferrando’s side did it again as they snatched a point. Al Rayyan were quick, powerful. They were the better team too. But the Qatar heavyweights could not find a way past a stubborn defence. Even if they did, Goa goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh rose to the occasion with two crucial close-range saves. For a team that was making their debut in the ACL, Goa didn’t seem overawed. It took about three minutes for them to find their feet and they started doing what they do best: keep the ball, pass, pass and then find space. Of course, playing against such a strong Al Rayyan side, that is a risky game. And the visitors almost capitalised. Yacine Brahimi, who comes here with experience of playing the UEFA Champions League with FC Porto, forced a mistake from Goa, only to shoot wide. Minutes later, Dheeraj Singh rescued Goa by diving at the feet of Yohan Boli. When James Donachie gave away the ball again, there was another chance for the visitors. The hosts, though, heaved a huge sigh of relief as the Ivory Coast forward ended up striking the side-netting. Goa didn’t seem to be overawed at the start. They had 47 percent ball possession in the first 45 minutes, much of it in their own half though; three corners and an attempt from Alexander Romario on target which goalkeeper Fahad Younes parried away for a corner. Seriton Fernandes was also presented with an opportunity from a quick counter but the right-back struck the back of a defender who did not give up the chase. The second half was more difficult. There was Glan Martins in the middle who seemed to be here, there and everywhere. Captain Edu Bedia came up with an assured display and no praise was enough for the back-four, sometimes five, who defended like their life depended on it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/acl-fc-goa-kickstart-campaign-with-fighting-draw-against-qatar-heavyweights-al-rayyan/articleshow/82073840.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Tope for oxygen concentrators at small hosps||Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope has proposed the use of oxygen concentrators to ease a shortage of medical oxygen in the state. Oxygen concentrators draw in room air and pass it through filters that remove dust, bacteria and other particulates. They then deliver this supplementary oxygen to patients experiencing breathing trouble. While liquid oxygen tanks will be installed at state hospitals with 50-100 beds, these machines — generating purified oxygen from the air — are being considered for procurement for small hospitals via District Planning & Development Funds, Tope said on Tuesday. “All districts are allowed to use 30% of their funds for Covid control. So administrations can decide if they want to use these machines,” the minister said. He said the machines will be first used in Jalna. A presentation on the machines was made before deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar recently. “A 6x5 high-tech machine can purify oxygen from the air and supply it to a large number of patients, and there are several options. We are thinking of procuring these machines,” Tope said. The state manufactures 1,250MT of oxygen, but if its daily consumption crosses 900 or 1,000 MT, it could spark concern. Many hospitals across the state are reporting oxygen shortages. Tope said that neighbouring Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh were not willing to give Maharashtra liquid oxygen. “Solutions have to be found,” he said.

The imposition of night curfew and other curbs have upset many wedding plans. The wedding season is going to start from April 22, and though night curfew has been imposed till April 20, but surge in cases is so big that the restrictions are likely to continue. Since there are just a few auspicious dates for weddings in April and May, many families are now in a fix. Atul, who had booked complete package of band, baja and baraat of a banquet hall is upset as the venue owner has now asked them to conclude all ceremonies by 8.30pm if night curfew is extended and restrict the number of guests. “The night curfew has shattered our plans. My family is thinking whether to scale down the wedding or reschedule it in November,” he said. The owners of tent houses, caterers, decorators, florists and other service providers are also worried as they see their earnings getting hit. R K Tiwari told TOI he had made all arrangements for his daughter’s wedding in old city area. “Now, both families are planning to invite limited guests and scaling down the preparations,” said Tiwari, adding, “We will not extend marriage date, but it will be a low-key affair.” The pandemic has played a spoilsport, but we still hope the ceremonies take place peacefully as scheduled, he added. Meanwhile, Prayagraj SP Dinesh Kumar Singh has asked guest house and marriage pandal owners to strictly follow all guidelines. He said gathering of not more than 50 is allowed in closed venues and maximum 100 guests can attend event in the open. Besides, the function should be over before 9pm. Prem Singh, manager of a banquet hall, said night curfew will hit business. “We have individually informed all those who had booked the venue about the restrictions imposed by administration. All the people have to redraw their plans and have sought some time for taking a decision,” said Singh. Some families are mulling ‘day wedding’ now to avoid chaos and hurry to wrap up everything by 9pm. Parul and Abhishek, who are tying the knot on April 28, have almost decided in favour of a day wedding instead of a night gala. “What can we do in such circumstances? We don’t have options. The administration is doing its job as cases are rising. New restrictions are being added every other day, so our families are opting for a day wedding,” said Abhishek.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/band-baaja-baraat-plans-hit-by-2nd-wave/articleshow/82056375.cms||---
---||Kozhikode||One more arrested, conspiracy alleged||Kozhikode: Police arrested one more accused in Mansoor murder case on Tuesday, taking the total number of arrested persons to five. Police identified the arrested as Bijesh from Pullookkara. It is alleged that he was involved in the conspiracy behind the murder. Meanwhile CCTV visuals —purportedly of a group of persons including one of the accused, who was earlier arrested, gathering on a road at Mukkil Peedika near Panoor just minutes before the attack on election day— strengthened suspicion that the murder was pre-planned. The footage collected from the CCTV installed in a building 100m away from the house of Mansoor and recorded from 7:50pm to 8pm allegedly shows a local DYFI leader arriving in the area, followed by the fourth accused Sreerag and two others. The visuals show them going inside a building and coming out soon. Also, a person is seen handing over something to Sreerag and they are seen leaving the area. The attack against Mansoor took place at 8:15pm on the day. Also, the mobile phone call details of the first accused Shinos —who was nabbed from the crime location on April 6— showed that fourth accused Sreerag and 10th accused Jabir had called him before the crime. Local IUML workers said that one of the persons seen in the CCTV was a local DYFI leader and Sreerag was also seen in the visuals. Police is examining whether the meeting of the persons just before the attack against Mansoor was to hatch a conspiracy for the murder. Meanwhile, Congress MLA Sunny Joseph told media that the CCTV visuals will now lend credence to the charges that there was a well-planned conspiracy behind the murder. “I had visited the crime spot after the murder and it is a small bylane away from the main road leading to the house of Mansoor. Gathering of persons on that road points that there was a pre-planned scheme to carry out the attack,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/one-more-arrested-conspiracy-alleged/articleshow/82055487.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

And Ayub Rasoolkhan Pathan is unsure how to tackle them. A driver by profession, he has been receiving calls from people seeking remdesivir, as Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has given out his number as its remdesivir helpline number. “Every person who calls, asks me for remdesivir. I can feel the desperation in the voices on the other end of the phone. When I asked, a couple of them told me it is a medicine for Covid. This has left me wondering why would the civic body list my number. I ask them if they need my help with vehicles but they disconnect the phone,” Pathan told TOI. AMC declared Pathan’s number on April 11. He says he receives close to 500 calls in a day. Pathan, who drives commercial vehicles at Sanathal Chowdi, does not even have a smartphone. “I have a very basic cellphone. When people call, I cannot even disconnect as many of my clients call me when they require a commercial vehicle. They complain if I do not pick up calls. However, how do I tell them that my number has been made public for this Covid medicine,” he said. TOI checked the AMC press release and Pathan’s number has been listed against the name Hiren Vora. AMC has also listed another number against the name Ganesh Rajput. On a caller ID platform, this number is listed to be that of ‘Ganeshsinh Rajput (Ganesh V S Pharmacist)’. When TOI called this number at 8.30pm on Tuesday, it was switched off. Meanwhile, Pathan called TOI, stating he that he needed to speak to an AMC official to get his number removed. “I hope people find this essential medicine. In the past two days, I have received calls seeking remdesivir for children, mothers, and grandparents, even late into the night. It was an overwhelming experience. Some of their voices still ring in my ears.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hello-amc-list-correct-remdesivir-helpline-number/articleshow/82055469.cms||---

In a letter to Sawant, the forum has stated that allowing students to answer the examination from their residence involves “a lot of difficulties and discrepancies”. The forum has suggested that the exam be scrapped and the students be assessed based on their performance of the first mid-term and the first term examination conducted in the offline mode. The “simple suggestion for the benefit of everyone and for the safety and security of students and teachers” was arrived at after a brainstorming session via GoogleMeet of principals, president of the forum Walter Cabral said. “Most of them felt that at this time of crisis the students, parents and teachers can remain safe and sound if our humble suggestion is accepted,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/principals-forum-suggests-cancelling-class-xi-final-exam/articleshow/82056394.cms||---

The cabby is yet to be traced. Satyavir Singh (27) was heading home to Chhalera after delivering a food packet on his bike when the cab crashed into him from the opposite side. Satyavir was wearing a helmet, but was flung several metres in the air. The cab driver managed to flee the spot. Satyavir was taken to Kailash hospital by passersby and was referred to Safdarjung hospital in Delhi from there. However, his family took him to the trauma centre at AIIMS, where he was admitted in the ICU. Arvind Singh, Satyavir’s brother-in-law, said he died around 11pm on Monday. “He had suffered a serious injury to the head. There were injuries to the foot and liver too. The doctor had suggested a surgery in the head but it was not be possible,” he added. Satyavir is survived by a three-year-old daughter and a wife who is five months pregnant. While an FIR had been lodged in the case under IPC sections 279 (rash driving) and 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) earlier, Section 304A (death due to negligence) has now been added to it, said Munish Chauhan, the SHO of Sector 20 police station. Three youths, including two minors, were seriously injured in another accident near the commissionerate office in Sector 108 on Monday night. The trio has been identified as Abhishek (21), Shabista (13) and Riazul (12). They were riding a bike that was hit by a pickup van.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Rock band spreads Ambedkar & Buddha teachings through music||No god came to save me/No prophet came and made me free You came and took my life in hold/It was like dust and you made it gold Had lockdown not clipped the wings of Dhamma Wings, a 10-year-old rock band that spreads the teachings of Dr B R Ambedkar and Buddha through its music, this freshly-born paean to Ambedkar titled ‘We are because he was’ would have travelled from Navi Mumbai-based singer Kabeer Shakya’s lungs to audiences’ hearts during their customary annual show on April 14. However, this Ambedkar Jayanti, like the one spent in lockdown last year, will be quiet for Shakya and his five-member Ambedkarite Buddhist gospel band, whose past performances on the occasion have not only prompted rustic boys into asking if they could touch the alien instrument called the guitar but also once propelled a bespectacled, octogenarian woman in Vardha to plant an appreciative kiss on their former lead guitarist’s forehead. Dhamma Wings (Dhamma is Pali for ‘equality’) would not have come to be, if not for a Thai monk at a monastery in Bihar’s Bodh Gaya who asked the young Shakya: “What turned you to Buddhism?” “I didn’t have an answer,” recalls Shakya, who was undergoing a three-month course to be a monk as it was a rite of passage among those in his Buddhist community. The question pushed Shakya, then a student of computer science, down the philosophical rabbit hole of Buddhism and Ambedkar, a series of books that buoyed him with their clarity. “How can someone be so precise?” mused Shakya, feeling let down by Indian society’s myopic understanding of the leader. “Internationally, he is celebrated as a beacon of knowledge but India still associates him with one community. He did a lot for the upliftment of those like us but he also did a lot for women’s rights and other issues,” says Shakya, who decided to spread his message by enlisting his favourite weapon: The guitar. Initially, he would wander into slums and strum for strangers. “At the time, people had seen folk musicians in Maharashtra who sang Ambedkar songs but they had not seen anyone play an Ambedkar tribute on the guitar.” Soon, in 2011, long before dissent art would become a thing, Dhamma Wings, complete with a keyboardist, bass guitarist and drummer, was born. They met fame in 2015 when their video homage to the social reformer titled ‘Jai Bhim Se’ ‘Koi nahi tha mere liye / Unhone apna jeevan tyag diya, Aandhi tufano se ladte rahe / Mujhe apne pairo pe khada kiya’ went viral, followed by their modern rendition of the late Marathi poet Wamandada Kardak’s famous ‘Chandanyachi Chayya’. From Pusad, a tribal Yavatmal town which had one TV set, to plush gated communities in Powai, the band has performed for all. As a “strategy”, the musicians alter the medium, if not the message. “In Karnataka, we perform in Kannada. In Delhi, we perform in Hindi. When the Japanese PM visited Gujarat in 2017, we performed for him in English,” says Shakya, whose band also performed at an event titled ‘Performing Resistance: Tracing modern Maharashtra caste history through music’ that year. While admitting his band is a modern incarnation of a long-standing tradition of protest music, Shakya says he doesn’t like the way headlines identify his band. “Please don’t call us a Dalit rock band. We have members from different backgrounds,” says Shakya, pointing out that one of them is a Brahmin. Shakya would rather people would drop the caste prefix, a boycotting sentiment that now binds many spiritual cousins of Dhamma Wings that have sprouted all over the country now including the indie Tamil band ‘The Casteless Collective’ from Tamil Nadu and social media-savvy hip-hop singers such as Ginni Mahi from Punjab. This trend energizes Shakya, who believes he, like all artistes, owes an obligation to progeny. “Future generations will wonder what writers, singers and poets were doing at the time of political and social turmoil,” he says. “Singing the king’s praises is one thing. But making him aware of the problems in his kingdom through music is important for artistes as they are more influential,” says the singer, pointing out that Ambedkar himself believed in the power of “one song to convey the gist of 10 speeches”. On the 130th birth anniversary of the leader, even as the pandemic has confined them to their homes (Ambedkar would have wanted us to stay indoors, says Shakya), nostalgia sustains. As he waits for the city to open up so he can shoot the video for the next song, Shakya recalls their show at Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Technical University in Raigad’s Lonere. A downpour made the stage collapse. “Electricity went out. It returned only in one phase,” recounts Shakya, who had immediately asked for the mike and equipment to be moved to a dim corridor. There, the band had performed in the illumination supplied by mobile phone torches of tech students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rock-band-spreads-ambedkar-buddha-teachings-through-music/articleshow/82054269.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

I visited at least three diagnostic centres. But all of them told me that though the test could be done, I would get my report only after four to six days. I had no option but to drop the travel plan,” the Koregaon Park resident told TOI. With many states making it mandatory for those traveling from Maharashtra to carry a negative RT-PCR report following the spike in the Covid-19 cases, the flyers are finding it increasingly difficult to get the test reports on time with most diagnostic centres being burdened by a huge rise in the volume of tests. A Pune airport official told TOI that they have started a swab sample collection for the flyers at the departure area. “The samples are sent to a lab with which we have entered into a tie-up for the tests. Many flyers were fretting that they were not getting the reports on time. Keeping this in mind, we have started the facility and ensured the flyers got the test reports within 24 hours from the time of the swab collection,” the official said. Shirin Jaini, who is supposed to fly to Bengaluru on April 15, said no lab in Pune ensured test results within 72 hours. One has to wait for four-five days for the test reports, she said on Twitter. Neelesh Poojari, another flyer, tweeted that he had to cancel his flight ticket due to the same issue. “I find it strange that the Kolkata airport doesn’t have an RT-PCR testing facility for domestic flyers. Such a facility is in place in Pune or Delhi,” Shrikant Raj, who travelled to Kolkata last month with the report, told TOI. Priti Tiwari, spokesperson of the Kolkata airport told TOI, that the regulation was in accordance with the state government directions. “There may be plans to create a testing facility for domestic flyers at the airport,” he told TOI. Airlines said the Airports Authority of India (AAI) should take a call to make things easier. “We are responsible to check the reports and we work according to the directions given. The AAI and the state governments can coordinate and make things simpler for flyers,” an airline representative said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rt-pcr-test-report-uncretainty-forces-many-flyers-to-drop-travel-plans/articleshow/82056420.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Nashik||Maharashtra: Mattress factory owner booked for using discarded masks as stuffing||NASHIK: The MIDC police in Jalgaon district have booked a case against the owner of a mattress manufacturing outlet for allegedly using discarded face masks (instead of cotton) to fill the mattresses. The police have seized the entire stock of the discarded masks and have burnt them. Used face masks are considered biomedical waste and there are strict guidelines in place for their disposal. MIDC police station inspector Pratap Shikare told TOI: “Two policemen were patrolling the Kusumba area of the MIDC on Sunday. There they met Radheshesham Chaudhary, the police patil of the village. Chaudhary provided a tip-off about the use of discarded face masks at the mattress manufacturing outlet. I received a call from one of the cops around 11.30 am. I directed the duo to visit the outlet to find out the authenticity of the information.” According to Shikare, when the two policemen went inside the outlet, they found two vehicles full of used face masks and many masks scattered on the floor. “Some of the employees were busy stuffing these masks inside the fabric covers of the mattresses. Our team asked the staff to stop,” he said. Shikare said the factory owner claimed this was the first time he was using discarded masks to make mattresses. He had vague responses to questions about how he had procured the masks. The police are trying to find out if any mask-stuffed mattress has already been sold. “We think the owner may have engaged local rag-pickers, especially children, to accumulate the used masks from various locations in Jalgaon city,” said Shikare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/mattress-factory-owner-booked-for-using-discarded-masks-as-stuffing/articleshow/82036639.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Thiruvananthapuram||‘Interview to help Shamseer’s wife’||Thiruvananthapuram: Save University Campaign Committee has petitioned governor Arif Mohammed Khan against the move to hurriedly conduct online interviews for the selection of candidates to the post of assistant professor in Kannur University. The move by the university to conduct an online interview, even when the election code of conduct is in place in the state has dubious motives, said the committee . “While the UGC directions clearly say that call letters should be issued in advance to help the candidates prepare for the interview, the present call letters are issued at a notice of less than one week,” the committee said in its petition to the governor. “It is understood that there is a move to appoint Dr Shahala, wife of MLA A N Shamseer, subverting the selection norms and criteria and overlooking highly meritorious candidates. Earlier also, such efforts were made by Kannur University and the University of Calicut to appoint Dr Shahala illegally, but were aborted due to prompt intervention from the high court and media,” said the petition signed by the committee chairman R S Sasikumar and secretary M Shajarkhan. It is highly probable that the present hurry by university administration in conducting the interview is due to the uncertainty in election results, said the petition that sought the governor’s immediate intervention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/interview-to-help-shamseers-wife/articleshow/82055516.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Congress corporator Ravi Raja, who is the opposition leader in the BMC, said there were thousands of staff members in Mhada, SRA and PWD who should be pressed into service for Covid-19 work. “The BMC staff has been on Covid-19 duty for over a year. They are all feeling massive Covid-19 fatigue and hundreds have been infected with Covid-19 and many have died. Engineers and staff from agencies like SRA, Mhada and PWD have been kept out of Covid duty, but now, in the wake of the second wave, there is a manpower crunch and officials from these agencies must be put on Covid duty,” he said. “The BMC’s sanctioned staff strength is around 1.4 lakh persons but there are a lot of vacancies. The current actual strength is around 1.2 lakh. So to supplement this, staff from SRA, Mhada and PWD must be pushed into service. They can do non-healthcare work like coordination, war room management and setting up of jumbo Covid centres. The BMC alone cannot do all this work while engineers and officials from other agencies sit at home,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-put-sra-pwd-mhada-staff-on-covid-duty-with-bmc-says-neta/articleshow/82056446.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Patna||Bihar: People miss temple visit as Chaitra Navaratra begins||PATNA: The auspicious festival of Chaitra Navaratra commenced on Tuesday amid fresh restrictions for prevention of further spread Covid-19 virus. Devotees worshipped goddess Durga at home, instead of thronging the temples. For the second year in a row, city temples wore a deserted look on the occasion due to state government’s order to keep all religious places closed for common people after the surge in Covid cases this month. Puja rituals, including ‘kalash sthapana’, were performed by temple priests at the famous Mahavir Mandir near Patna Junction. Mahavir Mandir Trust secretary Acharya Kishore Kunal told this newspaper that the recital of couplets of the Ramayana and the Ramcharitmanas will continue for nine days. “Although devotees will not be in attendance, but all the rituals and prayers will be carried out as usual by the temple priests,” he said. City residents celebrated the first day of the festival with less than usual enthusiasm. “The festival fervour is missing due to the pandemic. Temple visits and attending puja hawans at other people’s places are now a thing of the past,” said Amit Raj, a dentist by profession. Neelam Kumari, who used to fast for nine consecutive days during the Chaitra Navaratra as well, has decided against it this time owing to the fear of catching infection. “Fasting will have a negative impact on my immune system. Because of coronavirus, I cannot take that risk,” she said. Sangeeta Arya, a resident of Hanuman Nagar, said, “The festival will be a low-key affair just like last year. Instead of calling a priest, I will perform all rituals and scripture readings myself.” Aditya Mishra, who used to read the ‘Durga saptashati' daily in a temple, will perform all the rituals at home this time. “Since temples are closed, I'll have to perform all the rituals at home which is difficult for a bachelor living alone,” he said. Meanwhile, governor Phagu Chauhan and CM Nitish Kumar extended Chaitra Navaratra greetings to the people of the state. “I hope the festival of Chaitra Navaratra brings happiness, peace and prosperity to the people of the state,” Nitish said, appealing people to be careful in the wake of rapid increase in Covid-19 cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/people-miss-temple-visit-as-chaitra-navaratra-begins/articleshow/82054250.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Remdesivir sales don’t match critical cases||Ahmedabad: On Tuesday, NITI Aayog member Dr V K Paul said in a press conference that remdesivir is only for those “who require hospitalization and are on oxygen.” But over the past few months and particularly on April 7, 8, and 9 the scramble for remdesivir across Gujarat depicts a desperate situation. “Are these remdesivir supplies being hoarded, is the demand reflecting patients’ needs, or are the long queues made up of anxiety-driven citizens?” a senior state health official asked. “The reason for the rush must be investigated.” Remdesivir sales have been accounted for by the state government and are being declared daily. Two aspects have stuck out. Since November last year when the state was hit by the second peak, one could clearly see that the 2.27 lakh vials disbursed were meant for 37,900 patients. The figure was more than the Covid cases declared by the state government for all of November — 36,800. In December of 2020 and January and February of 2021, the requirement for remdesivir was 43%, 21%, and 39% of the new Covid cases declared by the state government for those particular months. Between February and March, there was a dramatic jump of Covid cases from 19,800 in February to 1.63 lakh in March. The month of April was a worrisome time for the state government. On April 7, 8, and 9 the number of remdesivir vials sold was meant for 12,000, 6,900, and 4,100 individuals respectively. On these days, the state government had declared 3,500, 4,000, and 4,500 new Covid cases in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/remdesivir-sales-dont-match-critical-cases/articleshow/82055522.cms||---

The woman, Raheem Unnisa, had alleged torture at the hands of her Somalian husband. She had got married to him when he had come to India as a student. Raheem Unnisa travelled to Somalia in 2017 with her four children and joined her husband there. She gave birth to another son there. “I have been able to return but I want my four sons who are stuck there to be sent to Hyderabad. They were not allowed to come back with me,” Raheem Unnisa told TOI. Social worker and MBT leader Amjed Ullah Khan had written to external affairs minister S Jaishankar about the plight of Raheem Unnisa in Galdogob district of north-central Mudug province of Somalia. Raheem Unnisa from Shastripuram Colony of Rajendra Nagar was married to Somalian national Omar Dahir Farah in 2008. He had come to pursue his studies in Tamil Nadu and after his marriage, stayed in Hyderabad for nine years. Problems for Raheem Unnisa began in April 2017 when her husband took her to Somalia. He put her up in a remote area in Galdogob district. While she was there, she got to know that her husband had two more wives – one from Maharashtra and one in Somalia. Raheem Unnisa also said her husband use to demand that she oblige his friends and this was also another reason why he allegedly put her to more hardship. “I was not even given food to eat,” she said.

---||Kochi||Kerala: Muslim women have right to do ‘reverse talaq’, says HC||KOCHI: The right of a Muslim woman to unilaterally divorce her husband outside of court, called khula, is legally valid, the high court has held. A division bench of Justice A Muhamed Mustaque and Justice CS Dias equated khula to the right of talaq available to Muslim men and declared a 1972 judgment (KC Moyin vs Nafeesa and Others) that denied such right to a Muslim women as not good law. Through the 1972 judgment, a single bench had held that a Muslim woman cannot divorce her husband outside of court, as Muslim men are allowed to do through talaq, and that she has to necessarily move for divorce through a court as Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act of 1939 (DMMA) requires so. After considering a batch of appeals, the division bench said that DMMA only governed faskh, which is divorce at the instance of wife in which a court makes a decision based on the validity of the cited reason. The other modes of extra-judicial divorces (talaq-e-tafwiz, khula, and mubara’at) available to a Muslim woman, as named in Section 2 of the Shariat Act, remained untouched in the DMMA, the court said. Talaq-e-tafwiz is based on a contract and the wife can obtain divorce if the husband violates terms of the contract. Mubara’at is separation by mutual consent. “Khula is the form of divorce conferred upon wife similar to talaq conferred upon the husband. The recognition of khula as a form of divorce is directly available from the Holy Quran. In Chapter II Verses 228-229, Quran confers rights on both husband and wife to unilaterally divorce the spouse,” the court said. Obtaining consent of husband is not a precondition for khula to be valid and the wife’s obligation to return the dower is based on the principle of fairness a Muslim is commanded to observe in the Quran, the court said. If the wife invokes khula and refuses to return the dower, the husband can approach a court, the judgment said. However, an effective attempt for reconciliation by the parties must be made prior to invoking khula for it to be valid, the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-muslim-women-have-right-to-do-reverse-talaq/articleshow/82055538.cms||---
---||Amritsar||Amid uncertainty, arhtiyas in Punjab take blank cheques from farmers||BATHINDA: Three days into the official start of wheat procurement in Punjab, uncertainty prevails over the payment mode. For the first time, direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme has been made applicable in Punjab, which neither arhtiyas (commission agents) nor farmers are completely familiar with. Arhtiyas are collecting blank cheques from farmers, which is turning out to be a major sign of uncertainty. Many farmers say the arhtiyas are doing this to be assured of the return of their loaned money or even interest amount on credit advanced to the farmers. However, the arhtiyas claim they are collecting cheques to upload the bank details of the farmers on the Anaaj Kharid (grain procurement) portal, a condition for direct benefit transfer. It is also being seen as a step towards benefit transfer to tenant farmers, as stated by Union consumer affairs and food minister Piyush Goyal. A section of farmers, however, feels that faultlines are already emerging in the “strong bonhomie” projected between the farmers and the arhtiyas. Till a few days ago, both the farmers and the arhtiyas were terming their relationship as ‘nau-mass da rishta’ (ties like nail and flesh), but now concede that it is more of a monetary arrangement as the arhtiyas are getting blank cheques from farmers for procurement of their wheat crop. “Arhtiyas have collected cheques from us for smooth procurement. We are uncertain about the status of cheques as to whether these will be used to deduct the loan amount from our accounts into which payment is made directly on procurement or for other purposes,” said a few farmers of a Bathinda village. Another Mansa farmer said the arhityas had made farmers give them blank cheques and they fear that the latter would deduct the loan amount from their accounts. However, such claims were vehemently denied by the arhtiyas. BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan said, “The relationship between farmers and arhtiyas is not ‘nau-mass da rishta’ but that of a knife and watermelon. Wherever the knife goes, it is a loss for the watermelon. We will check if the cheques are being collected and if so, for what.” A few days ago, senior leaders of Sanyukta Kisan Morcha, including Balbir Singh Rajewal, had advocated payment to farmers through arhtiyas and opposed DBT. In contrast, the largest farm organisation, BKU (Ekta Ugrahan), apart from Krantikari Kisan Union led by Darshan Pal, said they preferred DBT but the timing was not right. The arhtiyas, however, have a different explanation. “Blank cheques, crossed and without the account holder’s signature are being collected. These are being collected to get exact account numbers and IFSC code of the bank branch for hassle-free transfer of benefit into their accounts. The cheques are being returned forthwith,” claimed Dheeraj Kumar and Satish Kumar, two arhtiyas from Barnala. Federation of Arhtiyas Association president Vijay Kalra said no arhtiya from Punjab was collecting blank cheques for surety of return of his loaned amount. If any arhtiya is found indulging in this act, legal and disciplinary action would be taken against him, he said. Arhtiya Association, Punjab, president Ravinder Singh Cheema said cheques are being collected to rotate the limit of farmers depositing money in the bank and to collect account details for direct transfer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/amid-uncertainty-arhtiyas-in-pb-take-blank-cheques-from-farmers/articleshow/82055563.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Delhi||24x7 teams to keep watch in govt hosps||New Delhi: Delhi government has constituted 24x7 special cells to monitor the Covid management in 11 major government hospitals that are handling a majority of the caseload. The cells are headed by IAS officers who will ensure there are no gaps in treatment and management of patients to effectively utilise healthcare services. One team has been constituted at the headquarters level to supervise the cells. The overall idea is to reduce the number of deaths due to Covid through timely interventions . “In view of the rising number of Covid cases, 24x7 cells have been instituted at the 11 hospitals to ensure compliance with protocols for timely management of hospital admissions, proper treatment, satisfactory levels of patient care and analysis of Covid deaths,” said an order issued by the health and family welfare department. Each cell has three members who will work in 8-hour shifts. Each cell is headed by a nodal officer. The cell at the headquarters of the health department as well as in the hospitals will work in accordance with the standard operating procedure for Covid management. The SOP lays down that for the smooth and fast compilation of Covid-deaths data, every case should be immediately reported to the committee along with copies of case summary, medical files and relevant information. On reporting a death, the committee will go through the documents and examine the number of days between testing positive and death, co-morbidities, primary reason and place of death (home/hospital). For all the cases of deaths in hospitals, the committee will examine the number of days in hospital, condition at the time of hospitalisation, number of days between testing positive and hospitalisation and whether there was any delay in admission. The committee will also examine if there was a delay in admission in cases of brought dead to the hospital or death within two days of admission. After finalising the report, all deaths reported during the shift will be forwarded to the headquarters panel at the end of the shift.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/24x7-teams-to-keep-watch-in-govt-hosps/articleshow/82073990.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Pune||Societies call testing vans on premises to avoid footfalls in labs||Pune: Many housing societies in Pune are looking at arranging mobile testing vans in coordination with laboratories to prevent a crowd there. Societies are looking at tests for their residents and for the maids and service staff. Though the new restrictions about mandatory RT-PCR tests seem unreasonable, societies are now paying for the tests of security and housekeeping staff while individual members are paying for the tests of house helps, members said. Housing federation members feel these rules are of no use and fit people are unnecessarily being sent for tests adding to the load on the already overwhelmed laboratories. A society on BT Kawade Road tested all their domestic maids even though some were opposing it as they had no symptoms. One of the residents said the rules make no sense. If a person has no symptoms they should not be made to test unnecessarily. “Already those who have genuine symptoms are waiting to get tested and we are burdening the system with more tests,” a member said. Another society in Bavdhan said it is practically impossible to keep asking them to test every 15 days. “Practical solutions should be sought from the society representatives,” added M Hari, a member. Ravindra Sinha, secretary of Baner-Balewadi Pashan Residents’ Association, said many societies are proposing to start voluntary on- premises testing camps for their members. However, he had doubts about both government and private laboratories lacking infrastructure to ramp up testing facilities. As of now, the societies are paying Rs 250 for a rapid antigen test and Rs 800 for an RT-PCR test for domestic help. Societies are pitching in for the charges for security and housekeeping. Private laboratories said they are getting an increasing load of tests and they are not able to give the results within the stipulated time frame. “The load is huge and with these new guidelines, there is tremendous pressure from corporates and housing societies,’’a private laboratory representative in the core city area said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/societies-call-testing-vans-on-premises-to-avoid-footfalls-in-labs/articleshow/82056447.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Chandigarh||Wheat lifting crawls, space crunch in Haryana mandis||By: Amit Kumar KARNAL: Farmers continue to face the problem of space crunch after glut in Karnal mandi caused by tardy lifting of wheat procured. Government procurement agencies could not lift the procured wheat even as the government relaxed lifting norms and stopped generation of the gate pass for 24 hours on Monday. On Tuesday, farmers and arhtiyas who were unable to get space to unload the fresh produce held a protest over slow lifting and blocked the Karnal-Yamunanagar highway for several hours. They raised slogans against the BJP-JJP government, accusing it of harassing them. Even though the district administration assured them of speedy lifting, there is no relief for farmers as arrival of wheat in mandis continues. They alleged that there is no space left for farmers to unload their produce because old stock of wheat is still lying in the market due to the failure of government agencies to lift over 78% of the wheat procured in the district and 62% at Indri grain market alone. Data shows that till April 12, government agencies procured 3.55 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of wheat in the district, but only 78,710 MT has been lifted so far. Satpal Bairagi, president, Indri Arhtiyas Association alleged, “Transporters are not providing vehicle as per the number (quantity) registered on the portal, which has led to a glut in the mandi. Also, there is a huge shortage of gunny bags.” Parveen, a farmer protesting at Indri grain market said, “The government is deliberately not speeding up lifting of wheat from markets to impose the scheduling system. Earlier, the government had allowed us to bring the crop without scheduled message, but has imposed the law again. Gate pass is not being issued to farmers who are bringing their crop without schedule.” Indri SDM Sumit Sihag reached the spot and tried to pacify the protesting farmers. The blockade was lifted at around 3:30pm after the SDM assured protesters that wheat would be lifted on time and adequate bardana (gunny bags) would be provided. Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav said, “Government agencies and transporters have been directed to speed up lifting. Sudden arrival of wheat has created problems of space crunch as around 70% of the total targeted wheat has arrived in mandis of the district. The situation will turn normal soon as 15 more purchase centers are being established in the district.” He also urged farmers to bring their produce only as per the schedule system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/wheat-lifting-crawls-space-crunch-in-hry-mandis/articleshow/82055589.cms||---

They had recently shifted from their village to Saraikaiyan area in Shahjahanpur city in search of better income, where Nirmala allegedly had an affair with Sarvesh (32), a distant relative of Mahesh, said police. Sarvesh, who works in Panipat, had returned Shahjahanpur on Sunday and when he went to meet Nirmala, he stayed there despite Mahesh’s objection, said police. According to the victim’s brother, when his brother objected, his wife threatened to frame him in a police case and had even called her boyfriend at the house in everyone’s presence on Sunday. Suspecting it to be murder, the victim's family urged police to get the post-mortem examination conducted. The autopsy report confirmed the reason for death as ‘hanging’, said police, adding that they have booked the victim’s wife and her paramour under section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code on the complaint of the victim’s family.RC Mission police station SHO Sanjay Singh told TOI, “We have evidence that suggests that Mahesh ended his life because of his wife Nirmala and Sarvesh. We have arrested Nirmala, while Sarvesh is absconding.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-ends-life-over-his-wifes-illicit-relationship-wife-held/articleshow/82052924.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Nagpur||Wait for a bed till death, in govt as well as pvt hospitals||Nagpur: Seven persons are lying in the chamber just outside the dedicated Covid ward of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH). Some are lying on beds, others sit on benches, panting as they wait to get admitted. Three of them are dead. This is the situation at the 900-bed GMCH, billed to be among the biggest Covid facilities in the country. Mayaram Anjole has just died, and his son Pravin stands sobbing in front of the body. Next to him lies 38-year old Raju Pendam, who passed away around the same time. Those alive are barely a feet away from the dead, and appear too weary to even react. Another body lies a little further away, wrapped in a black sheet. Two medical students on duty stand in a corner, watching in vain, as they had attended to these patients. “No,” said one when asked if there weren’t any beds to take in the patients. Patients turned down by private hospitals are rushing to GMCH as a last resort, only to face disappointment and uncertainty even here. With no beds anywhere, they were waiting in the lounge for an answer from the authorities when TOI visited the hospital at around 2pm. “I came here three hours ago and since then have been only running pillar to post, only to get no answer. He was in a critical state,” Mayaram’s son Pravin told TOI. Soon, a couple of staffers came and wrapped Mayaram’s body in a black sheet as Pravin helped them. Next to him, Pendam’s wife sat grieving as his brother Atul tried to press his chest, probably in a vain bid to revive him. “We have been waiting since morning but have got no help. They want us to get a Covid report and said they will not treat the patient without a Covid positive report,” he said. Atul showed an HRCT scan report which read ‘probability of Covid’. “Wasn’t the scan report enough? They kept insisting on a Covid test report and my brother died in that time,” he said. Relatives of those surviving are busy trying to arrange a bed. Fifty-five-year-old Gumpha Wagdhe lay on the ground with an oxygen cylinder next to her. “The hospital staffers said they can administer her oxygen if we arrange a cylinder, so I got one for Rs7,000,” says her son Satyasheel. Nearby, Shabd Dahibade sat breathing heavily on a bench as his wife waited to get him a bed. He was lucky to be taken in some time later. Still waiting was Chaina Dey in her fifties, running around as her husband sat on a bed along with another patient. Two ambulances with patients stood outside. Kabir Uafade, who had brought his relative from Kanhan, got a stretcher after over a couple of hours. Gokul Tandulkar was still waiting there to get a bed for his father when TOI called him in the evening. Another patient who was brought in an autorickshaw was taken away after waiting for some time as another was seen going away on foot. GMCH medical superintendent Avinash Gawande admitted that the situation was critical in the hospital. “Yet we are ensuring that each one who comes to the hospital gets medical help. The Covid facility of 900 beds is full.” The hospital has 250 ICU beds but a larger number of patients needing ICU care are reaching GMC. “There is some space in two of the maternity wards but male patients cannot be shifted there,” he said. Regarding oxygen, Gawande said there was no dearth of the gas. The situation is not different at private hospitals. At Kingsway Hospital, among the major private facilities in the city, RSS Sarsanghchalak (chief) Mohan Bhagwat is also admitted. A hospital release said all his vital parameters were normal and he had a good sleep. At the admission desk, however, the situation is no different from GMCH. A relative is seen trying to push his case, even naming an influential person, but is asked to wait by an attendant. “We are an over 200-bed facility, including the ICU, and are full now. We keep getting patients, admissions is allowed depending on the situation. But lately we are also turning back 10 to 15 patients each day. They are referred to government hospitals,” said a staffer. The hospital has also begun a day-care facility from Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/wait-for-a-bed-till-death-in-govt-as-well-as-pvt-hospitals/articleshow/82055592.cms||Shishir Arya

The Qureshis, aged 30, were arrested at the airport in July 2019 after Qatari authorities found 4.1kg hashish in their bag. Unknown to them, Sharique’s paternal aunt, Tabassum, had used them to transport the drugs. She was later arrested. The couple was sentenced to a 10-year jail term and fined over Rs1 crore in 2019 by a trial court. But in March, the Qatar Supreme Court cleared them of all the charges. Senior NCB officer KPS Malhotra and his team, who had been working on the case as the couple’s kin approached them for help, found that the Qureshis were innocent and informed the Indian Embassy in Qatar. —Mateen Hafeez||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-couple-let-off-in-qatar-drug-case-back-home-today/articleshow/82057057.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Ahmedabad||BJ’s plea for testing machine nixed 4 times||Ahmedabad: The state government has on four occasions overlooked the request of BJ Medical College to buy a machine that can conduct a large number of Covid-19 tests rapidly. The machine, estimated to cost between Rs 5.5 crore and Rs 6 crore, can test as many as 3,000 persons a day. “With the machine, the results will be available in batches, each batch carrying 96 samples,” said a college official. “The first batch results take 3.5 hours after which results are ready every 30 minutes. So people can obtain the results in less than five hours with this machine.” If the machine is used for 24 hours, about 3,072 tests can be done, he added. Apart from the RT-PCR tests, the machine can run several other tests. Currently, there are six machines at BJ Medical College where about 2,000 people are tested daily. The college had submitted a proposal in May last year to the state health department to purchase the machine. “The department had put away the proposal, questioning the need for such a machine,” according to a source. “The college had time and again tried to persuade the government to buy the machine but the requests have been rejected four times so far.” The college authorities had also requested the installation of a similar machine at a government college-cum-hospital in Surat. Such machines have been installed at government medical colleges with attached hospitals in Jaipur and Patna. The machines have served well, said sources. On Monday, the Gujarat high court criticized the state government during the hearing of a suo motu PIL on the Covid situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bjs-plea-for-testing-machine-nixed-4-times/articleshow/82055591.cms||Bharat Yagnik

Late Tuesday evening, there was rainfall in Panaji, Bambolim, Old Goa, Honda and Sakhali in North Goa and major parts of South Goa including Vasco, Margao and coastal Salcete villages. Parts of Bardez, Curchorem, Sanvordem also received mild showers. At the fire services control room, there were calls for rescue of two buffaloes – one stuck in a chamber while the other than had fallen into a trench. Also, a cat trapped on the second floor of a building and a dog that had fallen into a well were rescued by the fire services. There were no calls for blocked roads, uprooting of trees or electricity poles as of 10pm on Tuesday. Though the thundershowers stopped within 30 minutes, power could not be restored sooner. While fluctuations in power were experienced in Panaji, down in Salcete, the coastal belt villages from Cavelossim to Colva were without power supply for over two hours. Power supply to Carmona, Benaulim and Colva sub-stations which was disrupted at 7pm was restored at 10.35pm. and that too only after bringing the matter to the notice of chief electrical engineer Raghuvir Keni. Assistant engineer Nicolau Moraes said there was circuit problem at Benaulim and Carmona sub-stations which they are trying to rectify. When reminded that a couple of days ago power to entire South Goa was shut down for pre-monsoon maintenance, he pleaded for time saying he is on the job. Most of the major stores in the area also downed their shutters due to prolonged power outage. Small shops were seen doing brisk business selling candles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/30-minute-rainfall-leaves-south-powerless-for-hours/articleshow/82056473.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Yen for Japanese forest therapy transforms concrete Mumbai into green||MUMBAI: A canopy of kanchan, karanj, neem, jamun and palash trees casting a 20-feet high shade on the Central Railside Warehouse is barely reminiscent of the cement bags, construction debris and toxic air particles that once defined this corner of a massive cement storage facility in Jogeshwari until even a year ago. Hemmed in by the concrete chaos and smoke-belching motor vehicles zooming past its busy roads, the 23,000-sq ft of dusty wasteland is now a foliage-rich micro forest with over 7000 kinds of medicinal and fruit-bearing trees with bumble bees and butterflies feeding on its nectar and pollen. This curious patch of lush jungle-like greenwood, smack in the middle of Mumbai’s urban sprawl is the first urban forest that the city watched sprout to life in 2020 when Pradeep Tripathi of Green Yatra, an environmental NGO, used the Japanese Miyawaki planting technique to recreate in one year, a natural forest resembling a 10-year-old one. “A green wall,” is what Tripathi calls this bulwark against heat, dust, carbon and concrete that the city is constantly heaving under. At least 50 such miniature fast forests have been popping up in unorthodox spots in the city — dumping yards like Nisarga Udyan, busy arterials road like Chembur’s Eastern Freeway and in barren wastelands such as Bhakti Park’s industrial ward — ranging in size that could be as small as a tennis court or as dead as a landfill site. Developed by Japanese vegetation ecologist Akira Miyawaki in the ‘80s and adapted on a war footing by urban cities like Singapore, Kenya, New York, and now Mumbai, crafting these DIY forests require saplings with well-developed roots of 20 to 50 different species planted closely together in a random mix like one would find in the wild. The trick lies in their proximity — three to five saplings per square metre — that pushes them to compete with each other for water and sunlight thus accelerating its growth. Advocates for the method say these micro forests “grow 10 times faster, 30 times denser and are 100 times more biodiverse” than those planted by conventional methods. Two years of watering, weeding, monitoring and they convert into a self-sustaining forest. If Tripathi has already sown nearly seven lakh saplings in and around Mumbai and gearing up to plant another lakh across Navi Mumbai before the monsoons, BMC swung into action and planted 2.21 lakh trees to fill 43 tiny Miyawaki forests over the past year, the first of which bloomed at Narayan Pujari Nagar near Worli this January. “Urban greening is emerging as a tried and tested approach to mitigate some of the impact of climate change. The BMC, in its budget for the years 2020 and 2021 allocated Rs 20 crore to plant at least 3.75 lakh trees using the Miyawaki method and the fact that most of these trees have reached a height of 5 to 7 feet in just one year is a sign that the forests are growing properly and can become the city’s lungs,” said Jitendra Pardeshi, BMC’s superintendent of gardens who likens it to the centuries-old tradition of Deorai, a practice common among locals in the Western Ghats to conserve small patches of forest as “sacred groves”. While such forest therapy as a fitting response to the city’s building boom, rampant tree felling and vulnerability to extreme weather shifts makes Miyawaki particularly attractive to many environmentalists, it can be expensive at the nascent stage. A would-be forester would need to bear a high initial cost for the intensive process of surveying the natural vegetation of the area, testing the soil, digging pits, building nutrients into the soil and judiciously plotting out a mix of trees. “It can cost you upto Rs 500-800 per sapling depending on the need to excavate the land, throw debris and buy new soil for replacement,” says Tripathi. But is creating mini forests across the city enough to salvage the city’s traditional tree cover? Urban planner Pankaj Joshi, principal director of Urban Centre Mumbai feels, while Miyawaki afforestation of critical stretches with large infrastructure projects may be a good way to heal sore plots of land and a great alternative to “farcical” tree transplantations that don’t survive, “Care has to be taken that most of the species planted are indigenous,” he says pointing at the silver oaks brought into Panchgani between the ‘20s and ‘40s. “It’s been 100 years and even now birds don’t sit on those plants nor do birds eat its fruits. It’s important that these trees don’t just perform as a plant but the entire ecosystem responds.” Tripathi agrees. Just a shade of green does not mean biodiversity. “The flaming red Gulmohar from Madagascar, rain trees native to South America or the yellow peltophorum from southeast Asia that you get to see in Mumbai these days are all non-native with hardly any birds nesting in them,” he says. At the same time, it’s not just about planting random indigenous plants. “One should not attempt a forest unless they’ve visited a virgin forest in the neighbouring area. One must survey the forest, study the distribution of trees and follow that same pattern when planting an urban forest.” And though Miyawaki forests cannot replace natural ones — “carbon content in an individual tree is less compared to one growing in a natural forest and they score less in hydrology due to a lack of deep roots” points out Subhash Ashutosh, director general, Forest Survey of India — the pros outweigh the cons. “Miyawaki forests can still be effective as a quality reforestation process because their total biomass content is high and so is their nutrient uptake due to their dense 1000-tree cluster of different species compared to natural forests with not more than 250-300 trees,” reassures Ashutosh. Apart from being an antidote to urban woes by lowering temperatures, reducing noise, supporting local wildlife and sucking carbon from the air, "Their potential to restore degraded habitats is a great advantage,” says Tripathi who has been using the Miyawaki technique to inject green into “dead and damaged land”. He recently planted 40,000 saplings at Nisarga Udyan in Koparkhairane that will transform the three-acre landfill site into the largest urban forest in the MMR region. “No land is a bad land anymore,” he smiles.

ED had earlier filed a petition before the NIA court stating that the gold smuggling case has money laundering aspects in it hence it must be transferred to the PMLA court. ED submitted that they registered a separate case under PMLA based on the FIR registered by NIA. As the NIA’s case has money laundering aspect in it, the case and all documents should be transferred to the PMLA court. However, while considering the petition at the NIA court on Tuesday, the NIA prosecutor, objecting to ED’s petition, submitted before the court that as per NIA Act, a case registered by NIA is to be tried at a designated NIA court and no other court can handle such cases. The NIA court asked ED to explain the necessity of such a petition. However, the ED prosecutor T A Unnikrishnan was not present. The court decided to hear the petition again next week. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/nia-opposes-ed-bid-to-move-gold-smuggling-case-to-pmla-court/articleshow/82055621.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

They said there was no panic booking of train tickets due to the impending restrictions. As all non-essential establishments are shut for the next 15 days, though, those employed as semi-skilled labourers and daily wage earners said they were worried about their livelihood and had hence decided to go back to their hometowns. Ram Vishwakarma, a resident of Gorakhpur, UP, said, “As it is, many shops and establishments are shut. I am a carpenter and won’t be able to travel to work due to the restrictions. I came to LTT to board a train but only reserved ticket passengers are allowed. I therefore have to return to my place in Goregaon today.” Autorickshaw drivers at LTT confirmed that many who had hoped to board trains for their hometowns had to return. Central Railway’s chief public relations officer Shivaji Sutar said, “A total of 23 trains were scheduled from LTT on Tuesday. Of these, 17 were north- and east-bound trains and five summer specials. So far, 106 north- and east-bound summer specials have been announced and we will run additional trains. People are requested not to panic and rush to the stations.” Apart from CR, Western Railway, too, has scheduled additional trains for north Indian states. An official said, “There were no chaotic scenes as those witnessed last year. We have been able to manage the crowds in an organised manner. Tents have been put up to provide shelter outside the station premises and water bottles are given out to keep passengers hydrated.” Not all passengers were leaving due to the lockdown though. Many wished to participate in polls or marriages. Gondia resident Ajmal Khan said, “I had already booked my tickets in advance as I am keen to attend panchayat polls, besides some weddings.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-migrants-throng-ltt-to-return-home/articleshow/82056467.cms||Manthank Mehta

The call was made at the rally organised by the farmer organisation at Takhat Damdama Sahib, at Talwandi Sabo on the occasion of Baisakhi. Sanyukt Kisan Morcha leaders Balbir Singh Rajewal, Ruldu Singh Mansa and some leaders from Haryana too participated in the conference. BKU Ekta Ugrahan president Joginder Singh Ugrahan alleged, “Narendra Modi-lea central government is hell bent to help the big corporates and the farm laws have been enacted keeping in view the interests of the corporates. However, the central government failed to assess the anger and determination of the farmers. Now, as farmers have made life tough for this government, it is trying to wriggle out. But farmers will not let it escape without repealing the laws.” Rajewal claimed the struggle started from Punjab but had spread across the length and breadth of the country. “It has busted many myths created by the powers that be. Now, as farmer has come on the roads he will not go back before winning the struggle,” he added. Women leaders from Haryana, Sharda Dixit and Ritu Kaushik, said the farmers there were standing like a rock with their Punjab brethren and women too were contributing in a big way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/head-for-borders-on-april-21-union/articleshow/82055605.cms||---

---||Goa||Persepolis a goal too good for Al Wahda||Margao: Persepolis FC kickstarted their AFC Champions League campaign with a solitary goal win over Al Wahda at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Wednesday. For all their attacking riches, the Iranian champions needed a goal from captain and defender Jalaleddin Hosseini in the 40th minute to pick up all three points in the group E opener. Persepolis have made it to the final twice in the last three years and it was not hard to see why rival coaches have labelled them as the favourites to top the group. They were quick with the ball at their feet, strong in the air, and had it been for some sharpness in front of goal, could have won comfortably. They started on the front foot, went close on quite a few occasions and made their dominance count in the 40th minute. It all started with a corner-kick which Al Wahda defended, only for the ball to fall at the feet of Hosseini who made no mistake with a powerful drive from outside the box. Al Wahda did not see much of the ball in the opening 45 minutes, but still created chances of their own when they had three shots on goal, one of which was on target. It was from Tim Matavz, who was afforded time and space just outside the box. The Slovenian World Cupper, however, could only shoot straight into the waiting hands of goalkeeper Hamed Lak. Al Wahda’s Syrian striker Omar Kharbin showed glimpses of the form that made him AFC player of the year. He too worked his way inside the Persepolis danger zone, but his attempt was wide of the target. Persepolis had chances of their own to increase their goal tally. However, Omid Alishah mistimed his header from inside the box and Shahriyar Moghanlou, the other striker, also went close.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/persepolis-a-goal-too-good-for-al-wahda/articleshow/82074062.cms||---

According to them, about 80% of Covid-19 patients suffer only mild to moderate symptoms and do not need hospitalization. Only 20% patients having more severe symptoms do so. However, many moderate patients also want to get admitted out of panic, which is leading to all hospital beds getting occupied, leaving none for those who actually need. “Mild and moderate patients can be well treated at homes under observation of family physician. Such patients need rest and good nutrition to improve immunity for a couple of weeks. Read our coronavirus live blog for all the latest news and updatesThey need to fight the infection with will power rather than get traumatised. They only need to keep a track of their oxygen levels and pulse rate through oximeter,” said Dr Ravindra Sarnaik, a member of Nagpur Covid-19 Committee and Covid Task Force.

Endorsing him, medical superintendent at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Dr Avinash Gawande added that patients were making a beeline for HR-CT scan and then rushing to hospitals, putting burden on their administration. “The family doctors must emphasise that HR-CT scan isn’t recommended before consultation. Only if there’s fever and oxygen levels have dropped alarmingly, they should get admitted.

GST commissioner Sanjeev Kumar, IAS officer of 1993 batch, has taken over as chairman, Airports Authority of India, while BEST general manager Surendra Kumar Bagde, his batchmate, has been appointed additional secretary, ministry of housing and urban development. While Bagde had completed his tenure, Sanjeev Kumar was GST commissioner for a year and four months. “It’s a routine procedure. Both were empanelled; they got the new assignment. It will enhance the presence of the state in the Government of India,” a bureaucrat said. The bureaucrat said it would be wrong to give a political colour to the development. “IAS and IPS officers do not belong to any party. They are with the government of the day. In fact, some officers who were powerful during Fadnavis’s term are still powerful,” the bureaucrat said. After an exit from the BMC, Praveen Pardeshi had taken up the position of global programme coordinator under the United Nations Plan. He has now been appointed member of the Capacity Building Commission, department of personnel and training. A week ago, the appointments committee of the cabinet approved his nomination. Former GST commissioner Rajiv Jalota, in waiting for more than nine months, has taken over as chairman, Mumbai Port Trust. Former DGP S K Jaiswal has taken over as director general, CISF. Former state intelligence commissioner Rashmi Shukla has an assignment with the CRPF. Senior IPS officer Manoj Kumar Sharma, who was in the Maharashtra State Security Corporation, has also taken up central deputation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fadnavis-blue-eyed-officers-opt-for-central-deputation/articleshow/82057076.cms||---

However, ED opposed the petition and requested the court not to grant permission. CB submitted before the court, which is also a special court for Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) cases, that they would have to question Suresh to know whether ED had coerced or threatened her to name the CM in the gold smuggling case. Suresh is currently lodged in Attakulangara Vanitha Jail under Cofeposa detention. While the court considered the case, the ED prosecutor objected to the petition and submitted that the permission to question Suresh in jail should not be granted as a petition to quash the FIR in the case registered by the crime branch is under consideration of the Kerala high court. However, CB through its prosecutor submitted that there was no issue in questioning Suresh in jail now as the high court had only directed not to question ED officers until the judgment was passed. The court will consider the petition again on Friday. The high court is also expected to pass a verdict in the petition filed by ED to quash the crime branch FIR on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cb-seeks-nod-to-quiz-swapna-in-jail/articleshow/82055634.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai to observe a quiet Ramzan amid 2nd wave||MUMBAI: A somber mood prevailed in Muslim pockets as the holy month of Ramzan began on Tuesday night amid the raging second Covid-19 wave. Since there are restrictions on the assembly of more than five people and places of worship are shut, Muslims, especially males who spent a lot of time in prayers at the mosques in Ramzan, are confined to their homes. What Muslims miss the most this Ramzan, like they did last year, is Tarawih, the special congregational prayers at night. “Since we can’t go to the mosque, I am preparing to offer the Tarawih namaz with just four or five people at home. My son will lead this special namaz,” said Maulana Burhanuddin Qasmi, director, Markazul Maarif, a research centre at Jogeshwari. A hafiz or one who has memorised the Quran leads this prayer while others listen to the recitation of verses of the Quran. Qasmi was among those who attended a meeting of group community leaders on Monday where many were upset at the government’s refusal to allow them to offer congregational prayers at home. “Here, the Covid-19 situation is explosive and it is in our interest too that we avoid crowding. We will follow the government guidelines in the fight against the pandemic,” said Qasmi. Many regretted they have been denied wide opportunities to seek divine blessings in Ramzan. Ramzan is also important because Quran was revealed in this month and any good deed in this month gets blessings 70 times more than done in any other month. “The heart is heavy because congregational prayers are not possible. The usual fervour of Ramzan is absent,” said Maulana Mahmood Daryabadi of All India Ulema Council. Ramzan is also the time when Muslims do maximum charity. Though they can give zakat, 2.5% of annual savings on charity through the year, most community members give zakat in Ramzan. Due to the restrictions in travel, not many zakat collectors from outside the city are expected here this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/city-to-observe-a-quiet-ramzan-amid-2nd-wave/articleshow/82056496.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

---||Chandigarh||Haryana farmer’s helping hand to Tikri protesters: 2 acres for growing veggies||Rohtak: In another expression of solidarity with farmers from Punjab protesting at Tikri border, a local farmer Rajnarayan Singh Yadav at Bahadurgarh here has given his two acres of agricultural land for free for growing vegetables. “In winter season, the raw vegetables supply ran unhindered as there was availability but with the onset of summer, there is a scarcity of vegetables at Kisan Andolan on Tikri border. Seeing this, I gave my two acres of land at Balaur chowk to Punjab farmers to grow vegetables to be used among protesting farmers,” said Yadav. Yadav, a retired customs officer from central government, said he was apprehensive when hundreds of farmers from Punjab had started camping on November 26 against three farm laws. “Within days, I found out that they were farmers and I provided them with a facility of drinking water and pitching tents, and let them use the fields to attend the nature’s call. Days later, they organised the things at their own level,” he said. “On the land, they will grow green vegetables like bottle gourd and eat them without being dependent on others,” he added. Shamsher Singh, a farmer from Amritsar who has been camping at Balaur chowk near Tikri border, said that they had been at the protest site since November 26 and local farmer Rajnarayan Singh Yadav had been extremely cooperative. “Without charging even a single penny, Yadav who has harvested his wheat crop has voluntarily offered two acres of his land to us for growing vegetables,” he added. Shamsher said earlier supplies used to come from nearby villages, but it had declined due to change in weather and there was an urgent need to look for a solution for the summer season. “We have brought vegetable seeds from Punjab to be sown at Yadav’s field. The land has been prepared by ploughing using our own tractors and hoping to have our own vegetables at the protest site,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-farmers-helping-hand-to-tikri-protesters-2-acres-for-growing-veggies/articleshow/82055655.cms||Sat Singh

---||Goa||Goa: With weather playing spoilsport, cashew farmers stare at bleak season||PANAJI: Owing to the erratic weather and extended rain, cashew harvest this time is expected to be less than productive and the season may end earlier than usual. Experts from the ICAR - Central Coastal Agricultural Research Institute (CCARI) said that poor weather conditions prevailing through most of last year and early this year will also have an impact on the cashew apple and nut size. “The development of fruit which used to take three months has taken only 2.5 months this season, so the development of the cashew apple and nut size is small,” principal scientist, horticulture, ICAR-CCARI, AR Desai said. The cashew crop is somewhat climate resilient as a species and can adapt to climate variations. As a crop, it has three flowerings so even if the first flowering period is affected, it can compensate in the subsequent flowerings. “Even though the initial trend was good, now, the flowers have been drying due to very high temperatures. Because of the sudden high temperature, cashew season is also going to end in advance by 15 days. The feni production will be affected if the season ends early,” Desai said. Farmers across Goa are therefore affected by this trend. “We have practically had no winter season, and this has been a serious problem in flowering and fruition of the cashew crop. Though there is still another month until harvest, there is no scope for the crop to improve. There is just been too much heat this time throughout the winter season,” said farmer, Jagganath Lawande. His orchard has faced a similar impact with respect to chickoo and mango crops as well. “This is probably the lowest productivity we have seen in the past couple years. We have harvested up to 3.5 tonnes in the previous seasons, but this time we may not even be able to get 1.2 tonnes of cashew,” Lawande said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-weather-playing-spoilsport-cashew-farmers-stare-at-bleak-season/articleshow/82056524.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Allahabad||Night curfew small step, consider lockdown in sensitive dists: HC||Prayagraj: Taking a serious note of the current surge of Covid-19 pandemic, the Allahabad high court on Tuesday directed the UP government to look into the viability of complete lockdown in districts where the coronavirus spread has increased alarmingly for at least two weeks or three weeks. The court further directed that all public gatherings must be restricted to 50 persons immediately. Hearing a PIL relating to Covid-19, a division bench comprising Justice Siddhartha Varma and Justice Ajit Kumar made it clear that if the court is apprised on the next date fixed of anyone moving on roads without mask, the court shall take it as an act of contempt on the part of police and will certainly haul up the senior superintendent of police (SSP), Prayagraj and other concerned districts for the same. The court also directed the district administrations to religiously comply with the guidelines issued by the state government on April 11, 2021 to check the spread of Covid in the state. The court emphasized that the immunization programme must be vigorously carried out through vaccination of a large number of people and directed the Central government and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to rethink extending the benefit of vaccination to students pursuing higher education and those appearing in Board examination of high school and intermediate looking at the largescale infection in population of younger generation. The court directed the Central government and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to rethink extending the benefit of vaccination to students pursuing higher education and those appearing in Board examination of high school and intermediate looking at the largescale infection in population of younger generation. “If the Board and other examination conducting bodies are going for offline examination, then the government must explore viability to extend benefit of vaccination to such students as well,” the court added. Passing the above directives, the court observed, “Night curfew or corona curfew is a very small step. It can curb only night parties and large religious congregation in the coming month of Ramzan and Navratri. What we need to ensure is that there is no unnecessary public movement even during day timings. We know that when river acquires velocity no band can stop it and yet efforts are made to restrict it. We need to restrict public movement at least for a week or 10 days to break the chain. If life survives one would regain wealth and improve his economy. After all every development is for people and if there are no men there will be no use of any development activity.” “We understand that complete lockdown for weeks together may not be feasible but looking at the current surge of pandemic, we direct the government to look into the viability of complete lockdown in those districts were spread has increased alarmingly,” the court further directed. “The situation is so alarming that if it is not handled carefully and cautiously we may lead to stage of complete collapse of the public health system,’ the court added. Expressing concern over insufficient infrastructure to meet the Covid patients’ requirements, the court directed the UP government to acquire open places in the city areas of districts that are worst hit in the state, to set up temporary level 1 hospital in a make-shift structure. “Arrange manpower on contract basis immediately to serve all those who are admitted to temporary level 1 Covid hospitals/centres,” the court directed. “We must give priority to public health over elections and the government is expected to streamline every department of public health and public care in the light of the observations made hereinabove,” said the bench while fixing April 19 as the next date of hearing in the case. The court directed the state government to file affidavit of an officer not below the rank of secretary in this court by the next date fixed detailing out the measures taken in the light of the observations made hereinabove. The court also directed that the district magistrate and chief medical officer (CMO), Prayagraj shall appear through video conferencing on the next date fixed. Besides, the court directed that a copy of this order be sent to the chief secretary, government of UP, district magistrate and SSP, Prayagraj, Lucknow, Varanasi, Kanpur and Gorakhpur within 24 hours for immediate necessary action at their end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/night-curfew-small-step-consider-lockdown-in-sensitive-dists-hc/articleshow/82056498.cms||---

Our regular suppliers are not being able to open their shops due to restrictions. The traders selling raw materials must be allowed to operate for a few hours every day,” said Sandip Belsare, president of the Pimpri Chinchwad Small Industries Association. Besides, fears of another lockdown and harassment by landlords are driving workers back to their home states. “We are trying to reassure our employees to stay here, and that the situation will not be like what it was last year. However, some employees are leaving for their homes due to the fear of a lockdown, given what happened last year. Besides, if any employee is testing positive, s/he is being pressured by their landlords and neighbours to vacate her/his house. We are trying to support them, and there have been discussions with authorities as well,” said Dilip Batval, the secretary of the Federation of Chakan Industries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/msmes-battling-raw-material-shortage-labour-exodus/articleshow/82056514.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Delhi||Delhi: Stable Covid-19 patients being sent home to free up beds for seriously ill||NEW DELHI: To make room for seriously ill Covid patients, Delhi government has started identifying stable patients in various hospitals to send them home or to Covid Care Centres. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also announced on Tuesday postponement of planned surgeries for three months in all Delhi government hospitals. “We need to bring the hospital management within a system of efficient planning. For example, we are now monitoring each patient in a hospital. If doctors feel that a particular patient can be cured at home, such patients are being requested to go home,” the chief minister said. Kejriwal also pointed out, “It does not mean that the hospitals and the government are shying away from their responsibility, not at all. We will provide such patients with an oximeter, and our doctors will call them regularly. We will monitor their situation even at home and bring them back to hospital if the need arises.” This step is essential to ensure that serious Covid patients have beds available in hospitals, he clarified. In the wake of the sudden spurt in Covid-19 cases in the capital, the occupancy rate of Covid beds is very high at private hospitals and rapidly growing at government hospitals. The chief minister requested everyone to cooperate with doctors to make this step successful. “It is their (doctors’) understanding, based on their expertise, that you can be cured at home. I request everyone to have faith and let the hospital management function smoothly. Please understand, we are shouldering the responsibility of the whole of Delhi and its well-being. For us, each life matters,” appealed Kejriwal. Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of Lok Nayak Hospital, Delhi’s largest Covid hospital, said the patients who were maintaining oxygen saturation level of 97-98 and didn’t have any symptom were being identified for going home. “Those who do not have adequate facilities for home quarantine are being sent to Covid Care Centres,” he said. A doctor at GTB Hospital said this step was taken during previous waves too but it had now come under focus because of the exponential rise in the number of cases. Pointing out that as per the data of past 10-15 days, 65% of the Covid patients are under 45 years of age, the chief minister asked young people not to leave home unless absolutely necessary. “When you do leave home, please strictly observe all Covid guidelines and protocols,” he urged. Efficient management of healthcare infrastructure is key to defeat the fourth Covid wave in the capital, Kejriwal said. “Covid cases are rising rapidly. In the last 24 hours, 13,500 new cases have been reported. At its peak during the third wave in November, the number was 8,500. The present wave is quite contagious and data shows that the youth and children are getting affected more than ever, contrary to the popular opinion about Covid,” he added. The chief minister said the AAP government didn’t wish to impose another lockdown. “We have decided to attach banquet halls and hotels in proximity of hospitals to increase the bed capacity. Patients who do not require intensive care can be placed in these facilities,” he said. Some hospitals, both private and government, will cater only to Covid patients, Kejriwal said. “I hope that we will receive support from the hospital management and the public in this.” He also requested everyone to donate plasma. “During the last Covid wave, people of Delhi came together to donate plasma. In the past months, the dip in cases decreased both the demand and the number of plasma donations. Once again, the daily demand has increased.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/stable-covid-19-patients-being-sent-home-to-free-up-beds-for-seriously-ill/articleshow/82055671.cms||AlokKNMishra

The new cases have taken the total number of cases among prisoners and staff since last year to 190 and 304, respectively. The population of all the three prisons (Rohini, Mandoli and Tihar) combined is 20,663 as on Wednesday compared with the sanctioned strength of 10,026. The 11 prison staff infected include one jail superintendent and two jail doctors. According to data shared by the jail administration, of the current cases reported since March 16, only three inmates have recovered so far. Between May 2020 and February this year, 120 inmates tested Covid-positive, of whom 118 recovered and two died. Among prison staff, 293 were found positive in the same period, and all of them had recovered. The jail authorities have been taking several precautionary measures and mandatory check-up for those above 60 lodged in prisons. After recent surge in cases, Delhi prison administration had also suspended meetings of the prisoners with their relatives and family members. However, meetings with their legal counsels were allowed to continue. Inmates are also allowed phone calls to family members on two pre-declared numbers daily for five minutes.

---||Delhi||Possible hotspots? CM urges Centre to cancel Board exams||New Delhi: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal requested the Centre on Tuesday to cancel the Central Board of Secondary Education examinations, scheduled to begin on May 4. In view of the rising Covid-19 cases, Kejriwal said, the centres may turn into infection hotspots.“The safety and security of children is very important to us. In the upcoming CBSE exams, six lakh students will appear and one lakh teachers will be involved in the examination process. These examination centres have the full potential of becoming Covid hotspots. Given the safety and security of students, it is my humble appeal to the Centre that the CBSE examinations be cancelled,” said Kejriwal.He urged the board to find an alternative method of assessing the classes X and XII students. “We can either take online exams or assess students on an internal assessment pattern and declare results keeping the tense situation in mind.” The CM added that many other countries facing the second wave had cancelled exams. “Many states in our country have also cancelled state board examinations.” Maharashtra has recently postponed its state board exams. In Delhi, all schools are affiliated to CBSE.Education minister Manish Sisodia questioned the need to conduct offline exams. “In view of the increasing Covid cases across the country, it is high time that CBSE cancels the board exams. When the entire year the classes could not be held as earlier (physically), why should the end-examination be held in the earlier style? If the examination is not cancelled, the examination centres could become hotspots,” he said.Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights chief Anurag Kundu has also written to CBSE chief Manoj Ahuja and has suggested either postponing the exam or reconsidering the assessment criteria focusing on internal examinations. Earlier, students had also run an online petition urging the board to cancel the exams. CBSE exam controller Sanyam Bhardwaj did not respond to calls. However, an official said they were closely monitoring the situation. The Union education ministry is also reportedly considering the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/possible-hotspots-cm-urges-centre-to-cancel-board-exams/articleshow/82055701.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Shift vax centres from big hospitals, say experts||PUNE: Virologists and public health experts have now urged officials to decongest big hospitals by moving their vaccination sites to schools, college campuses or to smaller treatment centres. The move, the experts said, will help prevent Covid transmission between potential cases and vaccine beneficiaries — both groups of people can often come in close contact in the hospitals’ common spaces such as parking lots, elevators and washrooms. Almost all big hospitals have said they are seeing a high number of Covid admissions. The ongoing shortage of remdesivir in the city has also caused long queues to form at hospitals with medical stores, despite orders that state it’s the hospitals that are supposed to procure the drug for patients and their families. All in all, the risk of transmission remains high at large hospital sites, experts said. Virologist Deepak Gadkari, former director of the National Institute of Virology (NIV) said, “Too much crowding on hospital premises can definitely spread Covid. A sizeable number of people, including senior citizens and people with underlying conditions, are visiting large hospitals for vaccination. They are likely to contract the infection from patients or their asymptomatic close contacts or relatives. So it’s time we started vaccinating people at schools and colleges with the provision of a standby medical unit.” Critical care expert Prasad Rajhans said common areas of hospitals — parking spaces, elevators and washrooms — can potentially lead to mingling and spread. Rajhans said, “We have to shift vaccination sites from big hospitals, at least to colleges or schools located near them. A medical kit with a standby ambulance is enough to take care of vaccine recipients if they experience minor symptoms. So far, the vaccines have been safe. Only very few recipients have developed minor symptoms, which subside easily.” More than 200 big and small private hospitals in Pune city, which are willing to hold Covid vaccination sessions, are currently awaiting permission from the PMC to do so. “Since most of these smaller units are mainly treating non-Covid patients, eligible vaccine beneficiaries, mainly senior citizens and those with underlying conditions, may be willing to get their jabs at these sites,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India (HBI), Pune branch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/shift-vax-centres-from-big-hospitals-say-experts/articleshow/82056501.cms||Umesh Isalkar

This is the fourth tiger death in Uttar Pradesh in a span of 45 days. Three of them died in Lakhimpur Kheri district. The carcass was found in Chaltua beat. Officials claimed that the tigress had injuries on its genitalia and was not able to hunt. They believe it died a natural death but will await its autopsy report. The autopsy will be conducted by a panel of experts at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) in Bareilly on Wednesday. Giving details, Sanjay Pathak, field director DTR, told TOI, “The tigress was spotted by a field staff on Monday. It looked sluggish and lay on the wetland for several hours. Our staff kept an eye on it and we ensured that water was available nearby as the big cat was dehydrated. We kept an eye on its movement throughout the night. It died sometime on Tuesday afternoon. It was a shy tigress and kept away from the tourism zone.” Pathak added that the DTR authorities had informed National Tiger Conservation Authority and senior officials about the deteriorating condition of the tigress. It was so weak that it was not possible to use a tranquilizer dart to rescue the ailing animal as it would not have been able to survive it, he added. On March 21, an adult tiger was found dead in Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary of Dudhwa reserve. Earlier on March 1, a tiger was electrocuted in a field near the social forestry area of Lakhimpur Kheri district after it came in contact with electric fencing laid by poachers. On March 15, the carcass of an adult tigress was found in Mala forest range of Pilibhit tiger reserve. Its four cubs were rescued 12 days later and shifted to Lucknow zoo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/tigress-found-dead-in-dudhwa-4th-big-cat-to-die-in-up-in-45-days/articleshow/82053699.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Nagpur||Well Treat Hosp director booked for culpable homicide||Nagpur: Dr Rahul Thawre, director of Well Treat Hospital in Wadi where four patients died in a fire incident last week, was booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder following a complaint by relative of one of the deceased. The offence was registered at Wadi police station on Monday.It’s learnt the cops had slapped the charges on Dr Thawre holding him responsible for the fire accident in the ICU as the hospital had no adequate fire-fighting equipment, emergency and fire exits and other precautions which could have helped avert the tragedy. While four patients had died, several others and hospital staffers too had a miraculous escape. Forensic report along with the findings of the fire department and electrical inquiry report of the public works department (PWD) are awaited now. The report of the medical board, constituted under civil surgeon, too has been sought in the case, it’s learnt. The hospital was also treating Covid patients, but it’s still unclear whether there was any sanction for the same.In the past, there had been a fracas at the hospital around a fortnight ago after the management had a tiff with a patient’s relatives.Senior inspector Pradeep Suryavanshi of Wadi police station said statements of key witnesses have been recorded. “We are awaiting the crucial reports which will help us in the investigation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/well-treat-hosp-director-booked-for-culpable-homicide/articleshow/82055719.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||MoEFCC moves to appoint consultant to amend Indian Forest Act||Nagpur: In a bid to promote ease of doing business, the MoEFCC has decided to take up comprehensive amendments to the Indian Forest Act (IFA), 1927, by calling expression of interest (EOI) for shortlisting consultancy organizations.The appointed consultancy firm will prepare a draft and submit it to the government. The EoI will open on April 27. The central government is undertaking a comprehensive review of legislations implemented by different ministries in order to synchronize them with contemporary needs.The MoEFCC has said the exercise is focusing on decriminalizing relatively minor violations of law, expeditious resolution through compounding relatively small offences, reducing the compliance burden on citizens, rationalization of penalties, preventing harassment of citizens, de-clogging the criminal justice system, expanding and improving use of resources, and promoting people participation and ease of doing business.Greens say the BJP government at the Centre has taken up various exercises to bring in legislative reforms on forest governance by diluting laws. The Indian Forest Act (IFA) is one of the major Acts which is administered in the forestry sector. The last such exercise on IFA started in 2017 and the first draft was placed in the public domain.“There was a lot of criticism and hence the plan was dropped. Similar was the case with amendments in the EIA notification last year but as lakhs of comments were received against the MoEFCC move, it has been stalled,” said environmentalist Debi Goenka.However, MoEFCC officials say based on comments received on an earlier draft, it has been considered that a more comprehensive and pragmatic amendment of the Indian Forest Act may be examined that may encompass, in addition to issues that have been described earlier, elements such as the provision of graded penalty, removing difficulties in trade and transit of forest products across states.“The idea is to encourage forest sector economic growth in the country, encouraging especially private sector, civil society, individuals to take up afforestation, tree plantation or develop and manage private forest on non-forest lands on their own, and incorporating pragmatic legal provisions already made in state forest laws and amendments in the IFA so that all states benefit similarly. The above central level legislative reform process will require wide consultation with the states and other stakeholders. The states should also have been asked to take into account NGT, high courts, and Supreme Court rulings of recent years,” Goenka said.“When the forests in the country are on fire, the move doesn’t come at the right time. From the EoI conditions, it seems the firm to be offered the job is pre-decided. The conditions state that the party should have branches in Delhi and offices in major states, it should have an annual turnover of Rs1 crore in each of the last three preceding financial years, permanent employees etc,” Goenka said.“Another condition is that the applying firm shall have handled at least one assignment of the value of minimum Rs50 lakh. With these conditions even we can’t qualify in the criteria despite having experience,” says Goenka.Sudhir Paliwal, convener of Vidarbha Environment Action Group (VEAG), said, “The MoEFCC has already started diluting environment laws to favour road development and industries. Even Forest Conservation Act (FCA) is under restructuring. The Centre is already formulated a PPP model in the forestry sector. At present, any eco-tourism activity needs FCA clearance but it is not taken. The basic aim is to dilute the laws than making them stringent.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/moefcc-moves-to-appoint-consultant-to-amend-indian-forest-act/articleshow/82055728.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

EDMC mayor Nimal Jain said that currently there were three crematoriums and two burial grounds, which were being used to partly deal with bodies of Covid-19 victims.“We have 74 pyres at the three crematoriums out of which 35 are used for Covid-19 patients. If Covid-19 deaths increase, we will use any of these crematoriums as a dedicated facility in addition to those at Geeta Colony and Jawala Nagar,” added Jain.“All the preparations are in place. At the two burial grounds also, fresh refilling of soil has been carried out to facilitate burial of more bodies,” said the mayor. From April 1-12, 77 bodies were received at the EDMC’s five sites.In north Delhi, 228 bodies were received from April 1-12. North Delhi Municipal Corporation runs six cremation grounds, one burial ground and one cemetery. “Since the maximum pressure is on Nigambodh Ghat where 130 bodies have been received this month, we are requesting people to use the other five cremation sites also. We have, anyhow, increased the number of dedicated pyres for Covid patients to 120,” said north corporation mayor Jai Prakash.In south Delhi, 200 bodies have been received at the five crematoriums and one burial ground from April 1-12. Narendra Chawla, leader of the House, SDMC, said: “We have planned out everything to avoid any last-minute panic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpns-gear-up-to-handle-emergency-as-deaths-rise/articleshow/82055733.cms||Vibha Sharma

However, officials said the glitches did not affect the vaccination process much. “The turnout was normal and the glitches did not affect the number of inoculations much,” said an immunisation officer.Some people claimed that the vaccination was taking longer than usual time at several sites because the verification and registration of the eligible people were hit. Officials said it was not a pan-Delhi issue and only some centres reported glitches due to server being down.“The verification of the individuals who turned up for vaccination got delayed because the system reported problems in verifying the beneficiaries through Aadhar card. They were verified through mobile number and OTP,” said an immunisation officer. “It happened for only a few hours.” In the last 24 hours, 89,065 individuals got the jab in Delhi, of which 73,827 people got the first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/glitches-hit-vax-drive-at-few-centres/articleshow/82055742.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Probe BMC remdesivir scam, centralise procurement, says BJP||MUMBAI: A day after BJP accused BMC of a scam in buying remdesivir, an antiviral used to treat serious Covid patients, the party sought a probe by the anti-corruption bureau and wrote to the CM calling for centralised purchase and distribution of the drug to cut black marketing. BJP alleged that BMC paid 2.5 times more per vial than what the state-run Haffkine Bio-Pharmaceutical Corporation (HBPCL) paid in the same period and ended up spending around Rs 17 crore more to buy remdesivir. “There should be an ACB inquiry into this. There is a clear nexus between officials of the central purchase department of BMC and drug-makers. I am going to file a written complaint with all the documents about the remdesivir scam and ask for a high-level probe,” said BJP corporator Vinod Mishra. BMC ordered 2 lakh vials on April 7 at Rs 1,568 per vial; HBPCL did so for around 57,100 vials at just Rs 665 per vial on April 9. Earlier too, BMC had purchased 50,000 vials of remdesivir on March 25 at just Rs 650 per vial. Amid this controversy, Shiv Sena MP Rahul Shewale has written to CM Uddhav Thackeray to nominate the state FDA or the HBPCL as a central window to procure remdesivir and channel it to hospitals. “Government of Maharashtra, through FDA or HBPCL, should buy remdesivir and sell it at a fixed price to patients... On account of a single procurement agency, as done in case of vaccines by the central government, our purchase price will be less and we will be able to give remdesivir at competitive rates to patients,” Shewale wrote, adding that this can stop panic and black marketing. “There should be cross subsidy — by charging patients in private hospitals and patients with insurance higher rates, remdesivir can be given free to patients in government hospitals and jumbo centres.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-probe-bmc-remdesivir-scam-centralise-procurement-says-bjp/articleshow/82056537.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Shaikh has also demanded that the AMC’s quota at private hospitals be increased to 50%. In his application, he requested the HC to allow him to join proceedings in the PIL initiated suo motu by the chief justice following a surge in Covid-19 cases. Besides demanding free treatment on 50% of beds at Covid designated hospitals, Shaikh demanded that the benefits of schemes like Ma Vatsalya and Ayushman Bharat be extended to non-Covid patients. He has also urged the HC to direct the AMC to start VS Hospital at its full capacity of 1,500 beds, a statement from the MLA said. Shaikh’s application is likely to be heard on Thursday, when the HC is scheduled to further hear the PIL on the issue of Covid-19. The state government and Centre have been ordered to submit reports on the present Covid situation and what actions they have taken to curb the spread of the disease. Earlier, the former MLA from Jamalpur, Sabir Kabliwala, filed a PIL seeking directions to the AMC to designate private hospitals as Covid-19 hospitals, with beds reserved for Covid patients and urged that free treatment be provided to people admitted on beds in the AMC quota.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mla-moves-hc-for-free-treatment/articleshow/82055731.cms||---

The girl’s father, who sells balloons on the streets, had lodged a complaint about the missing girl at Kannur police station on April 10, informed Francis Lobo, regional security commissioner, Madgaon. On April 12, the Kannur police learned that she was travelling in a train towards Goa. KRCL’s assistant security commissioner Satish Menon was contacted to trace the minor, who was supposedly travelling with a male friend. Menon alerted the RPF units at Thivim, Ratnagiri and Kankavli stations . The local RPF stopped the train at Ratnagiri station although it did not have a halt there to search for the girl. While the cops did not find anyone, some passengers, when shown the girl’s photo, confirmed that she was in the train. The RPF teams then noticed that a toilet in one of the coaches was locked from inside. After a lot of knocking, it opened to reveal the minor. “But the boy, known as Vicky, with whom she had eloped, was not found on the train. He promised to marry her at Okha in Gujarat, said the minor. Ratnagiri rural police took her custody and she was reunited with her father on Tuesday,”said Lobo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-13-yr-old-missing-girl-from-kannur-rescued-from-train-by-rpf/articleshow/82057148.cms||George Mendonca

---||Delhi||Delhi: From 448 to 6,852, Covid containment zones through the roof in a month||NEW DELHI: In the past one month, from March 12 to April 12, the number of Covid containment zones in the capital has gone up from 488 to 6,852. On March 25, the count was 1,506 and 5,346 zones have been added in the past 18 days. The highest concentration of red zones is in South, North and New Delhi districts while densely populated North East, East and Central districts have comparatively fewer numbers, indicating that more cases are coming from upper middle class and middle class areas during the fourth Covid wave in Delhi. However, compared with last year, each containment zone this time is covering fewer people. While last year up to 40,000 people came under some containment zones, this year most red pockets are covering dozens of people. The government is creating micro containment zones, which not only help the authorities in effective surveillance and health screening, but also hamper economic activities of only those people who are either infected or are at the high risk of exposure. According to the latest report, Delhi has set up 22,778 containment zones during the pandemic, out of which 15,976 have been desealed. South district now has 1,632 containment zones, followed by 920 in North, 680 in New Delhi, 668 in South West, 636 in West and 589 in South East. Densely populated North East district has 308 containment zones, East district 201 and Shahdara 379. A health department official said a trend had been witnessed that more Covid cases were coming more from upper middle class and middle class areas during the current wave. “It is difficult to pinpoint the reason behind it, but it is believed that the densely populated and slum areas have already been infected during the previous Covid waves,” health minister Satyendar Jain recently said. The Covid management plan of the government focuses on the management of containment zones the way it was done during the third wave. However, during the third wave, the number of containment zones did not see such a rapid rise. In the first two months of 2021, the number of containment zones had come down as the authorities had desealed several zones. The number started rising again as the authorities tried to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus infection by creating sealed zones in and around flats and buildings where Covid cases had been reported. A containment zone is desealed 14 days after the last Covid positive case is detected there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/from-448-to-6852-red-zones-go-through-the-roof-in-a-month/articleshow/82055760.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Chandigarh||Toxic groundwater poses health risk to people of Malwa: Study||Chandigarh: Heavy contamination of groundwater by toxic chemicals in Malwa region of Punjab is putting the health of its inhabitants at great risk, shows new research. What is more worrying is that the polluted groundwater used for drinking, domestic and irrigation purposes is making children vulnerable to both carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks, more than adults residing in Bathinda and Faridkot, according to a study by a team of experts from Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar. The presence of chemicals — arsenic (As) and mercury (Hg) over uranium (U) — was found to be above the permissible limits of World Health Organisation (WHO) in samples collected from the study area. The concentration of these chemicals has been attributed to excessive use of land for agribusiness and groundwater-use practices. The study was conducted to measure the extent of exposure and risk posed to the population in Bathinda and Faridkot districts due to the consumption of uranium and other potentially toxic elements in groundwater. As many as 84 and 40 groundwater samples were collected from Bathinda and Faridkot, respectively. Samples were collected from handpumps and borewells that were mainly installed in the inhabitant’s houses and agricultural fields, and regularly used for domestic, irrigation and drinking purposes. In Bathinda and Faridkot, average uranium contents were found to be 88 µg L−1 and 61 µg L−1, with 74% and 61% samples in the two districts, respectively, being above the WHO limit of 30 µg L−1 in groundwater. The major health concern in the study area was the raised concentrations of arsenic and mercury with average values of 176 µg L−1 and 174 µg L−1, respectively, in Bathinda, and 272 µg L−1 and 79 µg L−1, respectively, in Faridkot. An evaluation of hazard quotient (HQ) values found that the values in cases of arsenic for children (35.80 in Bathinda and 55.52 in Faridkot) and mercury (35.39 in Bathinda and 16.17 in Faridkot) were higher than the adults for arsenic (27.66 in Bathinda and 42.90 in Faridkot) and mercury (27.34 in Bathinda and 12.99 in Faridkot). These values were considerably higher than the safe limit, exposing residents of the areas to cancer. The potassium hydrogen (pH) value of groundwater was found to vary from 6.9 to 8.8 and 7.2 to 8.9 with the average values of 8.0 and 7.8 in Bathinda and Faridkot, respectively. The pH values of 16% and 5% of groundwater samples exceeded the acceptable limit of 6.5–8.5, which on consumption may disturb the normal pH of the human body, potentially leading to gastrointestinal issues and skin irritation. The findings of the study conducted by Tanu Sharma, Bikramjit Singh Bajwa, and Inderpreet Kaur have been published in the international journal Environmental Earth Sciences. The study concluded: “A health risk assessment also indicated that several potentially toxic elements including arsenic, mercury and uranium were present in groundwater at levels that were of health concern to groundwater users in the study area with the most significant health risks associated with As. The results obtained also abolished the myth that uranium is the only root cause for the large number of cancer patients in the study area.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/toxic-groundwater-poses-health-risk-to-people-of-malwa-study/articleshow/82055769.cms||Vinod Kumar

Chief Justice of India Sharad Bobde, who’s also its chancellor, would inaugurate the complex at 11am. In view of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the MNLU administration has decided to conduct the ceremony virtually. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray would also grace the occasion from Mumbai. Supreme Court judge Bhushan Gavai, Bombay High Court Chief Justice Dipankar Datta, Nagpur bench administrative judge Sunil Shukre, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari, higher and technical education minister Uday Samant, guardian minister Nitin Raut and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis would also attend the ceremony virtually. According to vice-chancellor Vijender Kumar and officer on special duty C Ramesh Kumar, the academic block includes two types of classrooms to accommodate 70 and 24 students respectively. Those are designed to be completely day-lit and glare-free environments. The building would also have conference halls to accommodate 200 students. “The block is designed to foster serendipitous interactions amongst students and teachers where the idea of education extends beyond the classrooms. The classrooms are planned along corridors. Those reflect the idea of pedestrian street networks organized around skylit courtyards and terraces, bringing in a sense of informality and lightness,” they said. The new building also has naturally ventilated spaces with the walls and roofs insulated to deal with heat. “The state-of-the-art structure would bring down energy demand for artificially cooling these spaces, lending to the idea of a sustainable campus. When completed entirely, the block would be totally self-reliant when it comes to water and electricity as well. The building is designed in exposed concrete, aggregate stone finish and natural granite allowing it to age gracefully over time expressing longevity and institutional nature of the campus,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cji-to-open-mnlus-academic-block-today/articleshow/82055754.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The online doctor consultation app, which is free, requires a sign up or sign in to the application DigiDoctor, followed by a checklist of symptoms and appointment booking with medical help. The app will help patients avoid hospital visits unless there is an emergency. Patients can also post their symptoms on the app, search for recommended medical speciality for their condition and take appointment for telephonic consultation. Additionally, the app will also serve as a digital backup for medical records and can also be used for consultation of family members through a single account. For those who do not use a smartphone, ELMCH has provided landline numbers with extensions to various departments of the hospital for consultation. These numbers are for the departments of post-Covid OPD, medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, paediatrics, orthopaedics, psychiatry, ophthalmology, ENT, TB & chest, dermatology, neurology, neurosurgery, cardiology, cardiac surgery, dental OPD, clinical psychology and department of happiness for stress management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/now-app-for-patients-to-get-medical-help-at-home/articleshow/82056533.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Coimbatore||Be polite with public, police commissioner tells city cops||Coimbatore: A three-day programme to sensitize sub-inspectors (SIs) of police and cops in other ranks on the need to be more polite while dealing with the public got underway on Tuesday. They would be trained by assistant police commissioners and inspectors of police. City police commissioner S Davidson Devasirvatham advised police personnel not to beat the public with lathi. The move comes in the wake of two incidents, in which cops thrashed the public with lathis for frivolous reasons. “Police personnel have been working tirelessly since the lockdown came into force on March 25, 2020. The SIs and constables have been on fieldwork for long and stressed out because of various reasons. I have instructed the assistant police commissioners and inspectors of police to hold meetings with them for three days,” the city police commissioner said. He had on Monday instructed the cops to behave in a polite manner while dealing with the public and abstain from using filthy language. “They have been asked to use megaphones in the vehicles and explain to the public about the severity of Covid-19 and instruct shopkeepers to adhere to the government guidance. If the shopkeepers fail to comply with the standard operating procedures, they would be booked.” G Stalin, deputy city police commissioner (law & order), said the people who violate the Covid-19 norms should not be dealt like criminals. He has also directed all the cops to behave more responsively with the public. Meanwhile, B Mohanraj, of Ram Nagar, who runs Sri Raja hotel at Gandhipuram, met Davidson Devasirvatham and told him Kattoor (law & order) SI Muthu had beaten up his employees thrice at the hotel. He said Kattoor police inspector Latha had seemingly put undue pressure on her subordinates, who in turn behaved in a rude manner with the public. The video of SI Muthu thrashing the customers and employees of the eatery had gone viral on Monday. He was subsequently placed under suspension. The city police commissioner expressed his regret to the hotel owner on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/be-polite-with-public-police-commissioner-tells-city-cops/articleshow/82055786.cms||A Subburaj
---||Delhi||Key takeaway: Curfew cancels eating out option in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Dinner service starting after 9pm gave restaurants in Delhi-NCR almost 70% of their summer revenues. But with night restrictions in force from 10pm to 5am, most dine-in outlets have been reduced to being delivery and takeaway places, with small or no dinner sales. Most restaurants have stopped accepting post-8pm dinner reservations at 8pm and delivery orders by 8.30pm to ensure employees reach home before 10pm. Restaurants are complaining of harassment of staff and raids on premises, but the cops say their hands are tied because they need to implement the night curbs. “Many people we stop at pickets claim to be returning home after dinner. We tell them they can’t violate the regulations just because they stay close by,” said an officer in south Delhi. “The pubs, restaurants and bars that we booked weren’t following social distancing norms. It’s humanly impossible to check all places and bars, but wherever we see a crowd, we do take action.” As for delivery executives, RP Meena, DCP (South-East), said, “The guidelines pertaining to delivery boys are clear that they must have an e-pass to do their work. We don’t stop anyone who has a pass. But moving around without a pass is a violation of the curfew rules.” Kabir Suri, vice-president, National Restaurant Association of India, and co-founder, Azure Hospitality, said the anti-Covid restrictions were a ‘body blow’ to the restaurant industry that had barely begun a revival after the lockdown.  Food delivery need to be declared a permitted activity during curfew hours, he said, adding that there is a problem getting curfew passes for delivery staff. Many others similarly complained about the Civil Defence Volunteers also turning up on their premises or in the markets threatening to issue challans, creating panic among staff and diners. They disclosed that outlets are avoiding visible branding on bikes or clothes because they are leading to their being harassed by police. Restaurant bodies have written to the CMs of Delhi and Haryana and the local police to clarify the regulation on food delivery. Delhi Police maintained that delivery executives can apply for passes online. “There are hundreds of people who apply for passes. Those in the permitted category are issues passes, others aren’t,” one officer said. Restaurateur Navneet Kalra complained about outlets being booked unnecessarily, forcing them to shut shop an hour earlier at 9pm.  He said it took almost six months after resumption of business to see shoots of recovery and the eateries are already staring at difficult months ahead “due to lack of support from authorities”. Varun Khera, restaurateur and Noida Chapter head of NRAI, has requested local authorities to extend the permitted timings to 11pm or allow deliveries till late because, unlike last year, people were willing to order in. Another restaurateur revealed that many restaurants could close down for the next three months to cut operation costs. Suri said that in an uncertain environment with no official support, the decline in cash flow by almost 60% made it a tough battle for the eateries. Kalra added that keeping an outlet operational in summers was in any case an expensive affair. Meanwhile, Delhi Police has been using social media to reach out to citizens to make them aware of the difference between the Civil Defence Volunteers and policemen. “We are different units. But because the uniforms look similar, people get confused and think it’s the cops harassing them,” claimed one officer. “We want people who are facing problems of this kind to submit complaints and we will look into it. As for Twitter posts, we do try to clarify the difference to the people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/key-takeaway-curfew-cancels-eating-out-option/articleshow/82055780.cms||Amin Ali
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Versova man donates AC ambulance to Chembur hosp||Mumbai: Versova resident Sumeet Dhawan donated an airconditioned ambulance to Inlaks General Hospital in Chembur on Tuesday in memory of his mother Namita Dhawan. His mother had died in 2006 because an ambulance couldn’t be found in time to take her to a hospital after she had suffered a massive heart attack. The donation of ambulance comes at a time when the Covid-19 cases are rising and ambulances are in great demand to carry critical patients to hospitals. “My parents were going for the evening walk when my mothered suffered a massive heart attack. We desperately tried to contact an ambulance service but by the time an ambulance came and we took her to a hospital it was too late. The doctor said she could have survived had we brought her a little earlier. That incident kept me haunting,” said Dhawan. In 2014 he founded Namita Dhawan Charitable Trust and began doing small charities like paying school and college fees of poor students. Then Dhawan decided to donate an ambulance to a hospital and began contacting manufacturers. Luckily one company delivered an airconditioned ambulancewithin four days and he donated it on the auspicious Gudi Padwa. “The donation of the ambulance will help poor and needy patients. We urge more such charitable trusts and donors to come forward and donate medical equipment and kits so that we could serve the people better in the challenging time of Covid-19 pandemic which has hit the world very badly,” said Vishamber Khatri, President, Inlaks General Hospital who lauded Namita Dhawan Charitable Trust for its beautiful gesture to donate an ambulance to his hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-versova-man-donates-ac-ambulance-to-chembur-hosp/articleshow/82056696.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

On April 13, Gujarat inoculated 1.57 lakh for the first dose and 47,035 for the second, totalling 2.04 lakh. Analysis of the pace revealed that the figure was 28% less than the average of the first 13 days of April at 2.8 lakh. In all, 84 lakh persons have been administered their first, and 11.6 lakh theor second dose of the Covid vaccine in the state. On Tuesday, Surat district recorded the most vaccinations at 32,924, followed by Ahmedabad (26,644), Rajkot (13,761) and Vadodara (8,170). While the state health department officials have denied any shortage of the injections, sources said that the pace has slowed down to keep a minimum buffer before new stock arrives. “With more vaccines getting the central government nod, it’s likely to result in exponential growth and possible opening of the vaccination for all adults. Experts have time and again stressed on a very high number of vaccinations to achieve herd immunity,” said a city-based expert. In terms of overall vaccination, Gujarat is among the top states. The state is primarily using CoviShield in its major cities, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/shot-numbers-fall-tuesdays-was-2nd-lowest-for-this-month/articleshow/82055794.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Hospitals ignore SC & state govt orders, deny admission to critical Covid patients||Lucknow: Despite the state government directives that no hospital, Covid or non-Covid in government and private sector, will refuse treatment to Covid patients, a number of facilities are reportedly denying treatment even in emergency cases. There are specific instructions of the Supreme Court that no hospital will deny emergency treatment to a patient. There are also strict orders from Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath that no patient should be turned away. In fact, the state government has directed that all non-Covid facilities should maintain a triage area where a patient, if found Covid-19 positive on arrival, should be kept and provided necessary treatment till she/he is shifted to a Covid hospital. However, both Covid and non-Covid hospitals are denying treatment to patients citing one reason or another. Ruchi Singh (24) had a miscarriage on Tuesday. As her husband was out of town, she went to a private hospital with the help of a relative where she tested positive to Covid-19. “The hospital staff immediately asked me to go to a Covid facility. I ran from one hospital to another despite excessive bleeding. At KGMU, I was told that beds are full. In two other hospitals, a private and a government, the staff asked me to come with a referral (order to admit a patient) from the CMO office,” said Singh. All this while she had acute pain and risk of developing sepsis. With the help of an acquaintance, she got help at Lok Bandhu hospital. Similarly, Raghvendra Pandey (58), who is under home isolation after testing positive, rushed to Balrampur Hospital after his blood oxygen levels dropped to 72 on Monday night. However, he was denied admission on the grounds that he did not have a referral from the CMO office. When TOI called hospital’s Covid in charge, GP Gupta, he said under no circumstances a hospital could admit a patient without CMO referral. Kamlesh Singh (52), who is comorbid and Covid-19 positive, is forced to stay in home isolation despite serious condition. “Nobody from the Integrated Covid Command Control Centre called to enquire about her health. As her blood oxygen level dropped, we arranged an oxygen cylinder to support her at home. However, despite external support, the levels are around 70-74,” a relative said. “As no hospital was ready to admit her without referral, we sought help from a doctor friend who advised her a dose of antiviral drug Remdesivir. The drug is out of stock in the city. With much effort, we found a hospital, which was ready to give a dose for a whopping Rs 18,000. The original cost of the drug is much less. However, we agreed, but then, we were told that the drug can be given only with a prescription which can be given by a doctor in a Covid hospital alone and no Covid hospital is admitting her,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hospitals-ignore-sc-state-govt-orders-deny-admission-to-critical-covid-patients/articleshow/82056541.cms||---

The number of active cases increased to 909 in the Agra district. In view of the surge in Covid-19 cases in the city, the district health department has added more beds to the wards, increased the oxygen supply and streamlined the medical infrastructure of the city. Around 194 fresh cases were reported on Tuesday which is the highest so far. The total number of deaths since March 2020 is 182 now. The total number of samples collected so far is 6,66,621. The recovery rate has come down to 90.75% from 98 per cent. With only the district hospital and the SNMC authorized to collect samples for testing, the government testing facilities have come under acute pressure. No private laboratory is allowed to conduct Covid-19 testing in Agra district. SNMC principal Dr Sanjay Kala said, “Following the surge in the number of patients admitted in a critical condition, we have started conducting Covid-19 testing of patients admitted in the emergency wards three times a day. Patients who have tested Covid-19 positive are being shifted to the Covid care center. This will reduce the bed occupancy in the emergency ward. We are also making arrangements for additional ICU beds.” Meanwhile, the anti-viral injection Remdesivir, used in treatment of Covid-19 patients, also went out of stock in government hospitals. “Intravenously administered, Remdesivir has been helpful in shortening the hospital recovery time of Covid-19 patients. The medicine is out of stock now. I have requested the state authorities to supply the medicine or allow us to directly purchase it from the market,” Dr Kala said. District magistrate Prabhu N Singh said, “We are making arrangements for additional Covid-19 patients. Public movement from 9pm to 6am has been restricted. Strict enforcement of Covid-appropriate behavior is being ensured. People who came in contact with Covid-19 patients are being screened. Random testing is being conducted in different parts of the city.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/over-400-covid-cases-reported-in-agra-dist-in-last-3-days/articleshow/82054373.cms||Deepak Lavania

Police said taking a cue from TV serials, he first killed her and then set her bed on fire. He tried to cover up the crime saying that four persons had attacked him and the old woman at home. SSP Navjot Singh Mahal said a resident of Bassi Kale Khan village on Monday complained to the police that his 83-year-old mother had been bedridden for the last three months due to a fracture in her right leg. He told the police that on Monday, he along with his wife, had gone shopping at Hariana town around 2pm and received a call from their son, who said some unidentified persons had attacked them. The complainant, his wife and some neighbours reached the house and entered from another gate as the main gate was locked from inside. They saw flames inside the elderly woman’s room and found her bed on fire while the boy was found with hands and feet tied in another room, said the SSP. Mahal said according to the boy’s statement, four unidentified persons barged into the house and set his grandmother’s bed on fire and threatened to eliminate the entire family if his father did not withdraw cases against them. He said they found some inconsistency in details given by him and when they questioned him further, he admitted to have bludgeoned his grandmother with an iron rod and setting her bed on fire. He told the police that he was “frustrated” with his grandmother.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/frustrated-by-grannys-illness-teen-kills-her/articleshow/82055818.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||No question of Kishor deciding on election tickets: Amarinder||Chandigarh: Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday ruled out any role of Prashant Kishor in finalisation of Congress tickets for the 2022 assembly elections. “There is no question about it. Kishor has no say in the matter,” said the chief minister, amid reports of resentment brewing in the Punjab Congress over his newly appointed principal advisor Prashant Kishor deciding on tickets. There are set norms and patterns for ticket allocation in the Congress, which are followed in all elections in all states, said Amarinder, adding that Punjab was no exception. There is a state election committee set up by the high command ahead of any assembly poll, which considers all the names and decides on the final candidates, he pointed out, adding that the shortlisted names are then sent for scrutiny to the screening committee, comprising top party leadership, including the Congress president. The final decision is taken by the party’s central election committee, with no individual having any role to play, he added. In the process of ticket finalisation, inputs are always taken by this committee from internal and external parties, including independent agencies as well as the state party unit, he said, adding that this is the process that was followed in 2017 and will be adopted again this time. “So where does Kishor come into the picture?” he asked. Amarinder said this system had worked well last time, when the Congress won 80 seats in Punjab. “Why should the party want to change it and disturb the political balance that we have managed to strike so beautifully in the past four years,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-question-of-kishor-deciding-on-election-tickets-amarinder/articleshow/82055792.cms||---

This came a day after its general secretary Yudhveer Singh told TOI that the farmers’ outfit has not taken any stand against the ruling party in the upcoming panchayat polls in UP. A statement issued by the BKU general secretary read, “Samyukt Kisan Morcha (united farmers front) is fighting against the anti-farmer policies of the central government. We are going to the states where assembly polls are being held and asking people not to vote for the BJP. Regarding the panchayat elections in UP, we would like to state that BKU is a non-political organization. We do not indulge in politics and do not appeal to people to vote for any party. We want people to vote for anyone except BJP-supported candidates.” TOI had a day earlier reported Singh saying BKU "had no plans to oppose any party, including the BJP". “People are smart enough to make the correct choice,” he had said. Sources said that a nudge from the top leadership of Samyukt Kisan Morcha and from the local leadership of BKU forced the outfit’s general secretary to issue a statement. Asked about it, BKU’s national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait stuck to his earlier stand. “I also never asked people to vote for BJP. It is a local election and people are free to choose anyone they want.” Talking to TOI on Tuesday, a senior leader of Samyukt Kisan Morcha, Gurnam Singh Chaduni, said, “So far, no agenda for discussion over panchayat election in UP has been received by the Morcha. Our stand is clear. BJP will be opposed in elections across the nation. The party-led central government has done injustice to farmers. Farmer leaders from UP have been actively campaigning against BJP in West Bengal. They should do that in UP as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/ups-rural-polls-bku-issues-statement-asks-people-not-to-vote-for-bjp/articleshow/82054392.cms||Deepak Lavania

On getting the test report positive, doctors immediately prescribe a range of anti-viral drugs and antibiotics to even asymptomatic patients. On the other hand, persons with comorbidities and other illness need a negative test report for hospital admissions for treatment. The stoppage of NMC’s 42 centres has also increased the load on private labs, thus delaying the reports now. Some private labs said they have stopped accepting samples more than their daily capacity, while others are now only processing rapid antigen test (RAT). On Tuesday, citizens also complained they were told that NMC testing centres would remain shut till Thursday, as they were on Tuesday for Gudi Padwa. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said NMC centres will open on Wednesday. “RAT will continue at these centres,” he said. NGO Help For Good founder Ashutosh Punyani said he received calls from people who had developed symptoms, but were told to isolate as testing was not possible for next two days at Dipty Signal centre. “If Covid testing is closed like this, it is not going to help. Why can’t the NMC or public labs increase machines required for testing. A labourer called me and asked where can he get tested. He had symptoms. If he goes to a private lab, he would have to pay Rs500. How is a poor person going to afford it,” he asked. TOI spoke to a private lab which said they have switched to antigen tests now, while another said they are not going beyond their capacity. Crescent Lab director Dr Sarfaraz Ahmed said we are not accepting samples beyond our capacity. “We are having more queries. But there is no point in keeping the samples pending. Delivering the report on time is also important,” he said. On Tuesday, public labs at Mayo, GMCH, AIIMS and RTMNU continued processing higher number of backlog samples.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/shutting-rtpcr-centres-delays-treatment-of-many/articleshow/82055835.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The audience also had the opportunity to learn some of their stories. The organizers - VOC Seva Arakkatalai and the National Cadet Corps (NCC) of the fourth TN battalion - chose Singanallur railway station for the photo exhibition because some freedom fighters from the district had derailed a train with weapons for the British at the station and stole them in 1942.The photographs were contributed by S Muthuvel, who heads VOC Seva Arakkatalai. A daily wage labourer, Muthuvel has been collecting photographs and stories of freedom fighters from the district for the past five years. He is a well-known person in the school and college circuits and a popular speaker during the independence and Republic Day functions at the schools.C Raveendran, Subedar-major of NCC cadets, fourth battalion, said, “Among the two or three locations we surveyed for the function, we chose Singanallur railway station for its significance in our independence struggle.”The exhibition was inaugurated by Col J P S Chouhan, commanding officer, fourth TN battalion.“The NCC cadets performed a small street play on our freedom struggle. The students discussed about the massacre and sought to know whereabouts of some of the freedom fighters’ families,” said Muthuvel, who has a collection of 400 photos of freedom fighters in the region.

AK Tewari (65), Aliganj, a heart patient, tested Covid-19 positive on Monday. The CT scan showed he has severe lung infection. “However, even after several calls to ICCC, CMO and other district administration officers for a bed in hospital, I couldn’t get one,” he told TOI. Jaykala,58, a resident of city station and a patient of hepatitis B, tested positive on Saturday. “I have been calling ICCC then for hospitalisation, but every time I get the answer that the bed is being arranged,” she said. After his mother and sister-in-law tested positive on Sunday, Rishi Subhash and his family are waiting for the past two days for the CMO’s contact tracing team to arrive and take samples of other family members. Number of complaints regarding delay in allotment of ambulances to shift patients to hospitals were received. “My father is critical, but I have been getting only assurances from the ICCC that an ambulance will be sent soon,” said Raghu Prasad of Mahanagar. Health officers said that they are facing acute shortage of hands, hence it is difficult to collect so many samples for tests in a day. “We are already collecting over 25,000 samples daily,” said an officer. A district administration officer said that ICCC makes over 6,000 calls to patients daily, besides receiving equal numbers of calls from people, hence lines are often clogged. “As many as 56 ambulances are working round the clock to shift patients to the hospitals, but the demand is so huge due to the surge in cases, often services are delayed,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/complaints-mount-against-command-control-centre/articleshow/82056572.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Mathura additional district and sessions judge Jahendra Pal Singh pronounced the verdict on Monday and imposed a penalty of Rs 50,000 on the convict. The victim’s mother had filed an FIR against her husband in Govind Nagar police station on May 4, 2019 under section 376 (rape) of IPC and sections 3/4 the POCSO Act. In her complaint, she had stated that when she was out of her house for work, he took advantage of the situation and raped her daughter for 8 months and impregnated her. The matter came to light when the girl complained of stomach ache to her mother. During medical checkup, she was found five months pregnant. Talking to TOI, additional district government counsel Subhash Chaturvedi said that the investigation officer filed a chargesheet in the case on June 26, 2019. He also put up an application in the court for girl’s abortion and as per directions, a panel of doctors was formed to give their opinion in the case. However, doctors did not recommend abortion of the fetus as it could have been life threatening for the girl. Finally, she delivered a baby boy after completing nine months of her pregnancy and the child was given for adoption thereafter, said Chaturvedi. In a similar incident, a man in Agra was convicted to life imprisonment in February this year for raping his minor daughter repeatedly for 10 days. The POCSO court also slapped a fine of Rs 1.75 lakh on the accused. The FIR was lodged six years ago at Jagdishpura police station in Agra on June 10, 2015. The POCSO court in UP’s Chitrakoot had also sentenced a man to life imprisonment after he was found guilty of raping his minor daughter. The man had committed the crime in February 2018 and was convicted after three years of trial in February this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/pocso-court-gives-man-life-term-for-raping-impregnating-minor-daughter-in-2019/articleshow/82054404.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Her family alleged that she was murdered after a failed rape attempt by a local who entered their house through the roof. Police said there were no injury marks on the body, adding that the postmortem failed to ascertain the reason for her death, and thus, they preserved the viscera for a lab test. The 35-year-old suspect, a labourer and resident of the same village, was detained by police for questioning. Police said they did not find any evidence against the suspect, so far. The girl’s parents are also labourers and she used to stay alone at home in their absence. No FIR was registered till the time of filing this report. Pilibhit SP Kirit Kumar Rathod said, “A police team rushed to the village after receiving the information. The girl’s kin have named a local whom they had seen with the girl in an objectionable position earlier in the evening. We will take action based on the autopsy report and circumstantial evidence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/girl-19-found-dead-parents-allege-she-was-murdered-after-failed-rape-attempt/articleshow/82053750.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||India||Covid vaccine: Assam turns away even those due for 2nd shot||GUWAHATI: The pace of Assam’s Covid vaccination drive slackened further on Tuesday amid a delay in arrival of fresh stocks and reports of even recipients scheduled for a second dose being turned away from state-run and private hospitals and clinics at various places. The health department has adopted a strategy of “rationalising” vaccination in the face of a shortage, entailing preference to those lined up for their second dose. State immunisation spokesperson Munindra Nath Ngatey said, “Wherever possible, the first dose is also being administered. But the instruction from the highest level in the state health department is that second-dose vaccination must not come to a halt.” Ngatey denied there was any plan to altogether stop administering the first dose till vaccine stocks are replenished. There is no official order to take any such drastic step, he said. Johar Choudhury, a resident of Doomdooma, was among those who were to receive their second dose on Tuesday but had to return without a jab because vaccination centres had run out of stocks. “My wife and I got our first dose on March 15 at a government hospital in Doomdooma. Both of us went for our second shot of Covishield today, but the hospital staff told us to come next Monday,” he told TOI. Health officials are said to be in a fix as droves of people have been turning up for vaccination at private and government hospitals over the past few days. On April 9, there was a controversy in upper Assam’s Dibrugarh as the district immunisation officer allegedly asked private hospitals to stop administering the vaccine to anyone coming for their first dose. The official has since been served a show-cause notice for issuing the order “without authorisation”, joint director of health services Dr Krishna Kemprai said. Health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had said that a consignment of vaccines would arrive on Tuesday, but officials said fresh stocks hadn’t arrived until evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/assam-turns-away-even-those-due-for-2nd-shot/articleshow/82058204.cms||Kangkan Kalita

Patiala police also shared the medico-legal report (MLR) of Sidhana’s cousin, Gurdeep Singh alias Mundi with the Delhi police. Police said they were unaware about the incident and examination of Gurdeep Singh Mundi by the Delhi police till Gurdeep reached and got admitted in a Bathinda hospital. In a statement before a team of Patiala police officials on Monday, Lakha’s cousin Gurdeep Singh Mundi made allegations of physical torture and abduction on the part of the special cell of the Delhi Police while he was on his way to Punjabi University, Patiala on April 8.Gurdeep said he was with his friend, Gurpreet Singh when he was abducted. In his statement, Gurdeep said they were presented before a senior police officer of the Delhi Police Special Cell before being let off on April 9. On April 10, Gurdeep got admitted in Bathinda civil hospital. Delhi Police, in a press release on Monday, accepted that Gurdeep Singh Mundi, cousin of Lakha Sidhana, was examined by the special cell of the Delhi Police in connection with FIR 28/2021 of Police Station, Special Cell. Maintaining that the investigation was being conducted in accordance with provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, Delhi Police claimed that its special cell team, while moving in the vicinity of Patiala, had examined and questioned Lakha’s cousin Gurdeep Mundi about his (Lakha’s) presence and movement. Afterwards, he was relieved with the direction to appear and join investigation as and when required. However, Delhi police refuted Gurdeep’s allegations of illegal abduction and physical assault, which they termed as false, baseless and an “afterthought to pressurise investigating teams.” “Bathinda police also came to know about the alleged ‘picking up’ of Gurdeep Singh Mundi from authorities of civil hospital, Bathinda as well as media reports on April 10. His statement was recorded thereafter. Earlier, Punjab Police was not aware of the alleged incident. The statement of Gurdeep Singh, along with its translated version (English) and medico legal report sent by the medical authorities, are being shared with DCP, special cell, Delhi Police, for necessary action at their end,” said Patiala SSP Vikram Jeet Duggal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/didnt-know-delhi-cops-examined-lakhas-cousin-till-he-reached-hospital-patiala-police/articleshow/82055850.cms||---
---||Delhi||No sanitisation drive in busy mkts: Traders||New Delhi: The civic bodies claim to have started sanitisation drives at public places to control the spread of novel coronavirus infection, but shopkeepers in many markets allege no such exercise is taking place. On Wednesday, traders in New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) areas requested its officials to launch a sanitisation drive as hundreds of people visit markets every day. “Earlier we had approached them for spraying disinfectants to control mosquito breeding, but hasn’t seen any drive so far. Considering the increasing Covid cases, the authority should have launched the drive on its own at least in market areas with high footfall,” said Amit Gupta, executive member of New Delhi Traders Association. If NDMC doesn’t act in two-three days, the association will get it done through its resources, he added. Ashok Kalra of Sarojini Nagar Market Association (big shops) said teams of civil defence volunteers and NDMC were coming regularly to challan people not wearing masks but were not taking concrete action to sanitise and decongest the market like last year. “We have traders who got infected recently. Since the market has turned into a hub for hawkers and customers are also standing around them without following social distancing norms, it is important to sanitise these places,” said Kalra. A senior NDMC official said they were sanitising areas based on requirement or demand of people unlike last year. “The idea is not to panic people, who may feel uncomfortable visiting markets after seeing these drives again and again,” said the official. Shopkeepers at other markets like Chandni Chowk and Sadar Bazar have suggested to North Delhi Municipal Corporation that along with sanitisation drives, testing centres be opened in markets. The corporation hasn’t started any sanitisation drive and traders are arranging for it themselves, alleged Rakesh Yadav, president of the federation of Sadar Bazar Traders Association. North corporation mayor Jai Prakash said they were finding it difficult to take sanitisation vehicles in crowded areas and looking for an alternative. “We will engage small tempos for spraying sanitiser and take a decision on Thursday,” he said. In south Delhi, traders want the corporation to extend its sanitisation drive at the houses and neighbouring areas of Covid patients to markets. Vijay Israni, vice-president of Green Park Market Association, claimed shopkeepers were sanitising shops for safety. Civic officials said the drive would start in two-three days. East Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Nirmal Jain claimed that they had engaged their entire fleet of machines and workers from various departments for regular sanitisation of places receiving heavy footfall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-sanitisation-drive-in-busy-mkts-traders/articleshow/82074141.cms||Vibha Sharma

City gurdwaras too avoided cultural programmes this time. Gurdwara Yahiyaganj started the day with ‘Nitnem Sahib’ (collection of Sikh hymns), followed by ‘Sukhamani Sahib path’ (prayer of peace). Devotees were seen visiting the gurdwara five at a time and adhering to Covid-19 protocols. For those who couldn’t visit gurdwara, online live-streaming provision was made, while packed ‘langar’ was distributed among devotees. “Baisakhi celebrates hope and harvest. It is our duty to do selfless service. It is my appeal to the citizens to stay at home and safe and pray for the well-being of their family and those who are fighting the Covid pandemic,” added Dr Gurmeet Singh of Gurdwara Yahiyaganj. ‘Paath’ and ‘kirtan’ were organised at Gurdwara Naka Hindola. Rajendra Singh Bagga, president of Lucknow Gurdwara Prabhandhak Committee, said, “Though the gurdwaras are open for the public, devotees should not overcrowd any religious place and maintain the Covid protocols. This is the only way we can fight the pandemic.” With candles and ‘paath’, many devotees also celebrated the day with their families.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/baisakhi-festivity-in-city-a-low-key-affair/articleshow/82056636.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||Patients’ rush puts extra burden on CT scan centres||Nagpur: Even as the RTPCR testing and delivery of reports slowed down and finally came to a halt, high-resolution computed tomography (HR-CT) centres started experiencing increased rush even of mild Covid patients putting yet another healthcare facility under pressure. Long queues are now seen outside these centres where Covid patients are flocking right on Day 1 of either testing positive or soon after giving their swab. Expert members of HC-appointed Covid19 committee have redflagged the trend saying these patients are turning superspreaders. Observations have also been made that discounts and special offers by scanning centres are also attracting people. Pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik, who is on the HC-appointed Covid19 committee, said RTPCR result is taking more than two days. “People become impatient and go for HR-CT though 80% of them are fine. In UK, they don’t even go for a CT scan,” he said. Dr Sarnaik said CT scan was needed in case of hypoxia and high grade fever. “Government guidelines also state this. General belief is that once they test positive they will have to sit at home. So they go for scan even before getting a positive report. Positive persons are wandering on the streets. Dr Imran Noor Mohammad, who is also a member on the HC-appointed Covid-19 committee, too said clinically if a patient was deteriotating only then a scan was needed. “It is not proven what CT score will help in assessment of recovery. But the people going for self-medication are creating panic. Unless a doctor recommends based on clinician assessment, there is no need to go for CT scan. I would say never go directly to a CT scan centre. Ask the doctor first,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/patients-rush-puts-extra-burden-on-ct-scan-centres/articleshow/82055855.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Coimbatore||Plans afoot to bifurcate Singanallur, Podanur, Peelamedu, Saravanampatti police stn limits||Coimbatore: If everything goes well, the city will get four more police stations soon. City police commissioner S Davidson Devasirvatham said they were preparing a proposal to the state government to create four new police stations by bifurcating Singanallur, Peelamedu, Saravanampatti and Podanur police station limits. “This would help and improve policing in the city.” Presently, there are 15 law & order and as many crime police stations in the city limits. There are also three all-woman police stations, two traffic investigation wings and other special units. For the administrative purpose, there are four sub-divisions - central, west, east and south - as well. Singanallur, Peelamedu and Saravanampatti police stations fall under the east sub-division. They cover a vast area of the city. Podanur police station, which comes under south sub-division, also covers a vast area. While there is enough infrastructure for police, officials have failed to create more number of police stations in the city. Earlier, the city municipal corporation had only 72 wards. In 2011, the wards were increased to 100 by including more semi-urban areas such as Vadavalli, Kurichi, Kuniyamuthur, Kavundampalayam, Thudiyalur and Kovaipudur to its limits. However, the city police haven’t yet expanded their limits and Vadavalli, Kavundampalayam, Thudiyalur areas continue to be under the rural police limits. After taking charge as the city police commissioner last month, Davidson Devasirvatham have studied the areas and decided to create four more new police stations in the city. “We are working on the proposal to create four more new police stations with law & order, crime and traffic units by bifurcating Singanallur, Peelamedu, Saravanampatti and Podanur stations. The proposal will be sent to the government by this month-end. If the government sanctions the proposal, the city would see better policing with more cops,” the city police commissioner said. As of now, the city police have a strength of 2,600 personnel, while the Madurai city police have more than 3,000 personnel. During his tenure as the Madurai city police commissioner, Davidson Devasirvatham had set up four new police stations there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/plans-afoot-to-bifurcate-singanallur-podanur-peelamedu-saravanampatti-police-stn-limits/articleshow/82055845.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Coimbatore||Dist likely to log 1,000 new Covid-19 cases a day soon||Coimbatore: The district’s Covid-19 tally zoomed past the 64,000-mark on Tuesday, when it logged 504 fresh cases. The active Covid cases also rose on the day to 4,520 even as 369 patients were discharged from treatment facilities. The district has so far seen 64,319 people testing positive for the virus. There was, meanwhile, no mention of any Covid death in the district in the health bulletin on the day. According to the health department, the district is likely to record 1,000 fresh cases a day in the next five days. Officials say this will not be the peak, which they suggest would be the double the number of cases that the district had seen earlier this week. If that is to be taken into account, there could be around 1,200 cases a day during the peak - the district had recorded more than 600 cases a day on Sunday and Monday - after which it would start reducing. Health officials have been asked to ramp up tracing of contacts of Covid positive cases to control the spread. With the number of fresh cases almost doubling in six days, officials seem to be mentally prepared to handle more cases by the weekend. “The projections suggest that the district will touch 1,000 cases a day by the weekend and the cases will continue to soar before the curve flattens,” said a senior health department official, who didn’t want to be named. To ensure availability of beds for the needy positive patients, Muruganantham, Covid-19 monitoring officer for the district, had on Monday advised district collector S Nagarajan and health officers to start promoting home isolation for young patients with no comorbidities. In the first wave, the number of active Covid cases had crossed 5,000 during the peak. “Right now, Codissia trade fair complex with 1,000 beds remains unoccupied. We also have around 500 beds vacant in the two major Covid care centres at the Bharathiar University and Karunya University,” said another official. Beds are also available at the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital. Officials have also been instructed to ramp up testing to 30 people per positive case from 10, if possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dist-likely-to-log-1000-new-covid-19-cases-a-day-soon/articleshow/82055848.cms||---

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: NGT gives green signal to Mettur irrigation project||CHENNAI: National Green Tribunal Southern Zone (NGT SZ) has given its nod to the Rs 565 crore Mettur Sarabanga lift irrigation project, which was inaugurated by chief minister Edapaddi K Palaniswamy on February 27, ahead of polls. The project, aimed at irrigating 4,200 acres of land in Edappadi, Sankagiri, Omalur and Mettur taulks, diverting surplus water from Mettur reservoir through 100 tanks, lakes and ponds. Following protest from a section of farmers, former DMK MP A K S Vijayan moved the tribunal alleging the state government neither conducted a proper environment impact assessment (EIA) study nor obtained prior environmental clearance (EC) from the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF&CC) So NGT constituted a joint-committee, consisting of representatives from MoEF&CC, state environment impact assessment authority (SIEAA) and Tamil Nadu public works department (PWD) to look into the issue and recommend necessary action, if there are any violations. According to EIA Notification, 2006 and its subsequent amendments, river valley and hydroelectric projects within 2,000 hectares do not need prior EC.  Citing this, the joint-committee in its report said the Mettur Sarabanga lift irrigation project was exempted from mandatory prior ED rule before commencing construction work. Though the project activity does not attract the provisions of the EIA Notification, 2006, the state undertook EIA studies through an accredited consultant (WAPCOS Limited), the joint-committee's report said. The report further mentioned that the government is trying to use flood surplus water for a period of 30 days in a year so that it will be useful for agriculture to recharge ground water in the area. Since the panel did not observe any violation during its inspection, it recommended no environmental compensation or penalties. Another contention raised by DMK MP was that Centre's consent was required since the interest of TN, Karnataka and Kerala are involved. The government responded by stating that they were regulating water received from Karnataka and water from Mettur reservoir is being utilised only for the benefit of TN people alone. So NGT SZ disposed of the petition and directed PWD to ensure that existing riparian owners get required water during lean season as far as possible while conserving surplus water. The district administration was told to ensure that beneficiaries of the project do not discharge untreated sewage or effluents into the river to prevent pollution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ngt-gives-green-signal-to-mettur-irrigation-project/articleshow/82058206.cms||Ram Sundaram

Employees should be allowed to go home after business hours. The purpose is to reduce exposure of staff to the public,” a statement from MGBEA said. Due to the Covid situation in Gujarat, MGBEA requested the head of the SLBC and the state government to issue guidelines to banks. “Bank branches will be vulnerable points for transmission of the coronavirus. Nearly 10,000 bank employees tested positive in March. Across Gujarat, some 3,718 branches of nationalized banks, 1,286 branches of the State Bank of India and 1,619 of district and state cooperative banks in addition to 769 branches of Gramin Bank and 2,206 private bank branch have been operating full time,” said Janak Rawal, general secretary, MGBEA. “After the hearing of the suo motu public interest litigation on Covid 19, the Gujarat government issued guidelines on Covid control and allowed government offices to work with 50% of their usual staff. We have made a representation on the matter to the SLBC and the chief secretary, asking the Gujarat government to issue guidelines for the functioning of banks branches,” Rawal added. Banks should be advised to work with reduced staff which will be helpful to employees as well as the bank in implementing a business continuity plan, according to the MGBEA. “Banks must close the branch for 48 hours if an employee tests positive for Covid-19.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bank-workers-want-hours-reduced/articleshow/82057255.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Mahajan said that she has been avoiding visiting crowded marketplaces in the backdrop of the rising number of Covid-19 cases. Like Mahajan, many are getting their daily requirements home delivered from local shopkeepers. Sandhya Joshi, a resident of Shivajinagar, said that for the last three months most of her purchases have been home delivered by shopkeepers in her area. “I place the order with the shopkeeper in the morning. The items are delivered by evening. The delivery boy keeps the goods in a bag outside the gate. The money is paid to him online,” she said. The retailers’ association has said that there has been a rise in home delivery in the last few days. Sachin Nivangune, head of the association, said that all the members are ready to offer home deliveries in their respective areas which will help minimise crowd on the road and shops. “We have been facing a lot of hurdles since last one year in running our shops. Lockdown cannot be the solution. We are looking for alternatives to handle the situation. The shopkeepers are ready for home deliveries. This will not only ensure that people get the things delivered at home, but also reduce crowd in the markets,” Nivangunde said. Daily grocery items are not the only ones being delivered at home. Many people are also getting their monthly medicines home delivered by local medical shops. Aakash Gadge, a resident of Karve Road, said that he gets medicines for his parents home delivered from the local medical shop. “There is no need for me to visit the shop,” he said. Nivangune said, “We have had a series of meetings with our members in the last couple of days and most retailers said that instead of a lockdown and closure of shops, there was a need to strictly follow the rules. We are following the norms. Employees showing flu-like symptoms are strictly told not to report for duty. People should also follow the norms while visiting the shops.” He said that the association was also contemplating staggered timings for shops to prevent crowding. “The government can allow opening of shops in a staggered manner to avoid overcrowding. The essential shops can remain open in the morning and others in the afternoon,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/retailers-witness-rise-in-home-deliveries-of-day-to-day-items/articleshow/82056684.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Coimbatore||Tamil New Year, Vishu push flower prices up||Coimbatore: Prices of flowers have almost skyrocketed in the city on the eve of the Tamil New Year and Vishu on Tuesday. The day also saw a large crowd thronging the flower market on Mettupalayam Road, despite the city corporation’s advice to avoid large gatherings in public places to contain the spread of Covid-19. While nerium oleander (arali), chrysanthemum (sevanthi) and tube rose (samangi), which are in high demand during the festival and sold in large quantities, were too pricy, they were still cheaper compared to the pre-Covid times. According to the traders, 1kg arali was sold at Rs 200, compared to anywhere between Rs 80 and Rs 100, while sevanthi was priced at Rs 400 per kg, up from Rs 200 earlier. Samangi saw a significant rise in price to Rs 140 per kg from Rs 20-Rs 30 and so was the case of jasmine, which was priced at Rs 600 a kg, up from Rs 300 earlier. Rose was also costly and sold at Rs 329 per kg, against Rs 160. H Mustafa, one of the traders, said, “The market used to see only 60% of the pre-Covid crowd of late. But ahead of the festive season, the crowd has multiplied. This time, the price of flowers has almost doubled and it may remain the same for the next two days.” Last year, flower traders didn’t clock any business for the Tamil New Year and Vishu, as complete lockdown was in place. Along with the relaxation in Covid-19 norms, good quality flowers are also available this time. Jasmine is procured from Sathyamangalam and Karamadai, lotus from Kanyakumari and Nagercoil, roses from Bengaluru, arali from Salem, and samangi from Krishnagiri and Hosur. Another trader, R Chitty Babu, said the sale has been dismal, despite the large turnout of people. “Because of the pandemic and financial stress, people have decided to do pujas in a simple manner. As a result, the quantity of flowers that they purchase has come down by at least 50%. They are also bargaining to reduce the price. If we refuse, they just walk away. We, hence, remain flexible to retain the customers.” Restriction on the number of people visiting the temple also has an impact on the flower business, he said and expressed hope that the government wouldn’t impose strict restrictions like last year. R Punithavathi, a resident of Peelamedu, said, “Just like the previous year, we have decided to celebrate the festival with close family members alone, because of the rapidly rising number of Covid cases. So, there is actually no requirement to purchase flowers in bulk quantity, as we used to do earlier.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tamil-new-year-vishu-push-flower-prices-up/articleshow/82055860.cms||Nivedha Selvam

The girl, who lost her father some three years ago, had now lost her mother in the pandemic. Surprisingly, while her mother Malwanti Chauhan had all the symptoms of Covid-19, she was not declared as Covid-19 dead as her RT-PCR test was negative. Nisha, who is the only child of Malwanti, was beside herself with grief when 1200-bed Covid Hospital at Civil Hospital handed over her mother's body. Malwanti was having all signs of Covid including fever for a day, extreme fatigue, breathlessness and later poor oxygen saturation. When she was taken for HRCT, the scan showed 70-80 percent lung involvement. “We were told this was advance stage of Covid. We rushed her to Civil Hospital as her oxygen saturation too had dipped low,” says Shubham, Nisha’s maternal cousin. “We were surprised when the hospital authorities informed us that mausi had died and she was not Covid positive. They said her RT-PCR was negative and we could take her mortal remains,” said Shubham. “We were told that we could get her remains examined for the cause of death but according to their records, mausi was not Covid positive,” said Shubham.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/girl-loses-mom-whose-hrct-showed-70-lung-involvement/articleshow/82056759.cms||Yogesh Chawda

---||Goa||Goa: Cochin Port Trust to construct cruise terminal at Mormugao||PANAJI: After completing the construction of a Rs 25.7 crore cruise terminal at Kochi, Cochin Port Trust has now been entrusted with the construction of the full-fledged international cruise terminal that is coming up at the harbour, said Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) chairman E Ramesh Kumar on Thursday. MPT issued the work order to Cochin Port Trust on Wednesday and the work is expected to commence shortly. “In the backdrop of the Covid pandemic and since Cochin port has already built a cruise terminal, we have decided to appoint Cochin Port Trust as the project management consultant for this project,” said Kumar. “The work order has just been issued and since they have already executed such a project, they just need to replicate it here.” MPT has an ambitious plan to develop a domestic and international cruise terminal, which will include Ro-Ro and Ro-Pax services, which will enable cruise passengers to directly travel by smaller ferries and boats to North Goa after disembarking. The plan also includes a commercial hub, which will come up within the terminal building, so that foreign tourists who do not wish to travel can still get a taste of Goa’s culture, cuisine and handicrafts. The techno economic feasibility report was prepared by Feedback Infra Private Limited, while Team One India prepared the architectural cum engineering design for the terminal and allied facilities. Kumar said that though the global cruise sector has hit a slump, it will bounce back, and that MPT would like to have all the infrastructure in place to have an early advantage. MPT unveiled the plan for the cruise terminal and allied facilities at the Maritime India Summit, during a session on investment opportunities in Goa. Presently, MPT has a 450m-long cruise berth that can comfortably accommodate cruise vessels. A second berth, which is presently leased to the Indian Navy and the Indian Coast Guard, is used as and when two cruise ships make a simultaneous port call. Meanwhile, cargo movement at the port grew 37% in 2020-21, even as other major ports in the country reported a contraction in freight movement. Despite the sudden halt in economic activity brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, MPT handled 219.5 lakh tonne of cargo in 2020-21 as against 160.2 lakh tonne in the previous year. Kumar attributed this to the steps taken by the port to reduce the impact of the pandemic on shipping movement. The MPT chief also said that he expected cargo movement to increase in the coming financial year as initiatives taken to diversify cargo could help the port.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cochin-port-trust-to-construct-cruise-terminal-at-mormugao/articleshow/82055857.cms||Newton Sequeira

---||Lucknow||Devotees mark Navratri with gaiety amid curbs||Lucknow: Navratri celebrations began at city temples on Tuesday with devotees offering prayers while following safety precautions and Covid-19 protocol. At Chandrika Devi Mandir, morning ‘aarti’ was performed by priests in the presence of temple authorities but the premises was not opened for public. The decision was taken by the temple committee keeping in view the health of thousands of devotees. “Rituals will be performed by the priests in the morning as well as evening. However, the temple will remain closed for the public. Their safety is more important to us,” said Akhilesh Singh, president of Ma Chandrika Devi Mela Vikas Samiti. Chowk’s Santoshi Mata temple allowed only five devotees at a time to offer prayers. They were not allowed to make any offerings. Temple bells were kept covered. Devotees queued up at Badi Kali Ji Mandir in Chowk and Kali Bari temple in Ghasiyari Mandi to offer prayers like every year. Following the SOPs announced by the administration, temperature of devotees was checked and the temples were sanitized after every two hours. At Mankameshwar Temple, customary rituals were performed by head priest Mahant Divyagiri. “The nine-day festival celebrates nine forms of ‘Shakti’ or ‘Devi’ which resides in every girl and woman. We pray and wish that women in our society are respected every day of the year, not just for these nine days,” said Mahant Divyagiri. The temple will observe ‘kanya pujan’ by distributing essential food items among the needy. At Hanuman Setu Temple, priests wore facemasks and maintained social distancing. “The temple is being sanitised regularly and heavy security is deployed to tackle any rush,” said Diwakar Tripathi, secretary of Shri Sankat Mochan Hanuman Ji Trust. Most of the residents celebrated the festival at home. Those who couldn’t visit the temples, tuned into Youtube and Facebook to watch live-streaming of rituals. All major temples have adopted virtual ways and live-streaming of ‘puja’ and ‘aarti’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/devotees-mark-navratri-with-gaiety-amid-curbs/articleshow/82056688.cms||Aditi Singh
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Covid claims ‘Court’ actor, activist Vira Sathidar||Nagpur: Activist, writer and actor Vira Sathidar, 62, passed away on Monday night while under treatment for Covid-19 at AIIMS Nagpur. He is known for his role in the National Award-winning film ‘Court’, which was also nominated for an Oscar. Though he was popular for essaying the role of Narayan Kamble, the protagonist, in ‘Court’, for the Ambedkarite movement and theatre in Nagpur and Vidarbha, Vira was much more than a movie artist. He was a poet, lyricist, literary activist, human rights activist, writer, journalist and teacher. He was actively associated with Dalit Panthers, the anti-caste movement. Vira was born Vijay Vairagade in Parsodi village near Butibori to a father who used to work as a porter at Nagpur railway station, while his mother was a construction labourer. His parents were also associated with the Ambedkarite movement and they insisted he pursue an education. During his early days, he worked as a labourer in many factories in MIDC Nagpur. This was the period when he was influenced by the Leftist ideology. He also worked as a journalist for a local Marathi newspaper. Later, he edited ‘Vidrohi’, a Marathi magazine. Vira left the caste-expressing surname and took ‘Sathidar’ (comrade) as his second name, inspired by the Leftist movement. His songs were quite popular in ‘Ambedkari Jalsa’, a literary musical event in the street play format. Ambedkarite activists Nihalsingh Rathod, Mukund Adevar, Dinanath Waghmare, Republican Movement’s Naresh Wahane, Prakash Kumbhe from RPI, Rajan Waghmare from RPI-A, and many other organisations paid tributes to Vira . “We have lost a father figure today,” said Rathod. “He will be missed badly. The news of his death, just a day before Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar’s birth anniversary, is more painful,” he added. ‘Court’ director Chaitanya Tamhane said, “I am yet to process this extremely shocking news. I don’t know what to say; I am speechless right now. I fondly recall the time we took him on board as the lead actor for my debut directorial. He was one of the nicest human beings I met. We have lost a talented soul.” Theatre activist Virendra Ganvir, who was close to Sathidar, said, “He was like a guru for many artists like us.” Communist leader Raju Desale said Vira’s style of working and energy was like that of a youth. “He participated in every movement for the enlightenment of society. Vira Sathidar was an important link in our movement. This is an irreparable loss for the Communist Party of India,” said Desale. Vira’s last rites were performed on Tuesday afternoon. He is survived by his wife and son.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-covid-claims-court-actor-activist-vira-sathidar/articleshow/82056718.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Chennai||Wind in their sails||Chennai: The sea in the backyard, the sun overhead and the wind in the right direction for the better part of the year have played a part in many sailors emerging from Chennai over the years. They have gone on to bring laurels at various national and international competitions. However, a direct qualification to the Olympics — the biggest stage for any sport — was missing. That box was ticked by four Indian sailors who qualified for the Tokyo Games last week. Nethra Kumanan, K C Ganapathy and Varun Thakkar represent the Tamil Nadu Sailing Association (TNSA), while Vishnu Saravanan, whose family is from Vellore, is a subedar who sails for the Army.Before them, nine sailors have represented India at the Olympics but this is the first time that Indians have ‘qualified’ for the Games. Last January, Nethra became the first Indian woman to win a medal (bronze) at the Sailing World Cup in Miami, United States. Her rise (in the Laser Radial Class) in sailing has been steady and she has gone from strength to strength. Last week, Nethra became the first Indian woman sailor to book a berth in the Olympics. Varun and Ganapathy caught the attention of many when they won bronze in the 2018 Asian Games in the 49er Class. The sport of sailing has had a long relationship with Chennai. The first set of sailing activities began in Ennore over a century ago. In 1911, the Madras Sailing Club was established by Sir Francis Spring, who was the first chairman of Madras Port Trust. It soon became Royal Madras Yacht Club (RMYC) that produced top-quality sailors. The birth of TNSA in January 2002 infused a lot of young blood into the sport. "We had about six sailors to start with. By 2004, we were ruling the roost by winning most of the medals in the age group of 8 to 15," recalls Munna Jamal, one of the founding members of TNSA. Jamal has shaped Nethra, Ganapathy and Varun in their formative years. It’s interesting to note that the three would have missed the Tokyo bus had it not been for their never-say-die attitude. The medal race at the Asian qualifiers in Oman last week saw Ganapathy falling into the water in the final stages. However, the duo quickly regrouped and made sure they finished fourth in the race and won a ticket to Tokyo by winning the Mussanah (Oman) event. Nethra had a different issue to tackle. Her boat, stationed at the Abu Dhabi port since the qualifiers were postponed last March due to Covid-19, suffered some damage by the time it reached Oman earlier this month. "I had to borrow a newer boat from Ram Milan Yadav who was very kind enough to give it to me," says Nethra. Jamal felt it was their strong-willed nature that brought them this far. "Losing never was an option for Ganapathy and Varun. They will keep pushing right till the end," says Jamal. At the 2018 Asian Games, Varun-Ganapathy’s chance of a podium finish was hampered when they were disqualified in the penultimate race of the competition. But the duo fought back to not only win the final race but also bag a bronze medal. Being on the same is their USP as both chose to quit school and get into the open education system. "We are always on the same boat. In fact, we are still pursuing our graduation," says 26-year-old Varun, who was busy giving his exams online at Vels College before the Asian qualifiers. The 49ers team is supported by Arun Vasu, a water sports enthusiast himself. A niche sport, sailing doesn’t need much investment to start with, it demands deeper pockets as one grows into the sport, says Nethra’s father Kumanan, who manages an IT business. "We have received the support of the GoSports Foundation who have helped Nethra find a nutritionist and a psychologist. Her college SRM too have supported her immensely," he says.The Tamil Nadu government has also been supporting the three sailors in their endeavours. Varun and Ganapathy are part of the Champions Development Scheme of the Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu, while Nethra is in the Mission International Medal scheme. Going forward, one can be sure that the trio’s feat will rub off on others who want to take up sailing. Ashok Thakkar, president of TNSA, is hopeful that more parents will encourage their children to sail. "Parents will back their children to embrace the sport. It should also open doors for more government support in sailing," says Ashok.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/wind-in-their-sails/articleshow/82058207.cms||Prasad RS

Organised by PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s UP chapter, the event aimed to look at the bottlenecks keeping the eligible persons away from vaccination and also encourage them to take the jab. Adding that the government and doctors were working tirelessly, he called upon people and pressure groups like social organisations and industry bodies to make collective efforts for virus control. “The war against Covid-19 can only be won with collective efforts equally by the citizens also,” he said. Earlier, in the welcome address, vice-president PHDCCI Pradeep Multani said that over the years, vaccines have prevented countless cases of disease and disability, and have saved millions of lives. “Once the vaccination is done, we not only protect ourselves, but also save our family and community from a contagious disease,” he said appreciating the concept of the Tika Utsav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/collective-efforts-can-control-second-wave-says-health-min/articleshow/82056715.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Sachin Waze did rare ‘nil panchnama’ to build alibi on night of murder||MUMBAI: Arrested API Sachin Waze, in order to provide more credence to his alibi that he was not present in Thane on the night of March 4 when businessman Mansukh Hiran was last seen alive, documented his visit to a bar in Dongri as part of police action in the form of a ‘nil panchnama.’ Hiran’s vehicle was used to plant explosives near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25. Hiran’s body was found floating in a creek in Mumbra on March 5. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has stumbled upon several documents, including the nil panchnama prepared by Waze and API Riyazuddin Kazi on the night of March 4. Senior officers were surprised when they studied the ‘Tipsy’ bar panchnama prepared by Waze and Kazi. A nil panchnama is prepared if nothing objectionable or no illegality is noticed. Normally, when the crime branch or social service branch carry out a police action, they make a panchnama only if they find the establishment indulging in illegalities like obscene dance or operating beyond the stipulated time. “These special units normally raid and inform the local police stations to take over the investigations. The local police draws a panchnama and initiate further action under the law. But if they don’t find any illegalities, they just leave the premises without making any panchnama. Here, Waze and his team raided the Tipsy bar at around 11 pm and stayed there for around two hours, drew a nil panchnama and went home to Thane at around 2.30 am,” said an official. On March 4, Waze left behind his mobile phone at his office in the police headquarters, scaled the wall, walked to CSMT and took a train to Thane. On reaching Thane, he used a SIM card obtained fraudulently through an accomplice from Gujarat to call Hiran. Waze also told Hiran to tell his wife that inspector ‘Tawde’ has called him to Ghodbunder Road. Waze and his accomplices then followed Waze’s autorickshaw to some distance and then gave him a lift in one of Waze’s SUVs. It is suspected that Waze handed over Hiran to his accomplices to eliminate him, and he himself took a train from Thane. At around 10.30 pm, he got off at Byculla station where he met someone who dropped him to Dongri police station. On the way, he asked Kazi to get his mobile phone to Dongri. At around 11.30 pm, he along with Dongri police carried out a search of Tipsy hotel but did not find any irregularities there. Waze’s mobile phone shows that he left Dongri for Thane at around 2.30 am.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-waze-did-rare-nil-panchnama-to-build-alibi-on-night-of-murder/articleshow/82057324.cms||Ahmed Ali

The commission issued a notice to the Madurai city police commissioner and sought a detailed report on the matter within three weeks. According to the news report, the complainant, Tamilarasan, of Kalaivanan Nagar near Koodalnagar, is a homeopathy doctor on Covid duty at the Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai. On April 10, he was on his way to work on a two-wheeler, when police intercepted his vehicle near BB Kulam junction. Tamilarasan provided his driving licence and other vehicle documents to police, but was made to wait, according to the report. Tamilarasan had reportedly showed police his identity card and asked them to allow him to leave as he was on his way for emergency duty, but the policemen verbally abused him. The police personnel then picked an argument with Tamilarasan stating that he was not wearing a face mask and also allegedly assaulted him on his face. Tamilarasan was then taken to the Tallakulam police station where he was made to stand for over an hour and was threatened by police, who did not even provide him water, according to his complaint. When he complained to the station inspector, the sub-inspector and his team assaulted him and threatened that they would foist a false case against him.

---||Chennai||SHRC seeks report from Madurai city police commissioner on assault on doctor||CHENNAI: State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) has taken suo motu cognizance of a news report about police assaulting a government doctor on his way for Covid duty in Madurai. The commission issued a notice to the Madurai city police commissioner and sought a detailed report on the matter within three weeks. According to the news report, the complainant, Tamilarasan, of Kalaivanan Nagar near Koodalnagar, is a homeopathy doctor on Covid duty at the Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai. On April 10, he was on his way to work on a two-wheeler, when police intercepted his vehicle near BB Kulam junction. Tamilarasan provided his driving licence and other vehicle documents to police, but was made to wait, according to the report. Tamilarasan had reportedly showed police his identity card and asked them to allow him to leave as he was on his way for emergency duty, but the policemen verbally abused him. The police personnel then picked an argument with Tamilarasan stating that he was not wearing a face mask and also allegedly assaulted him on his face. Tamilarasan was then taken to the Tallakulam police station where he was made to stand for over an hour and was threatened by police, who did not even provide him water, according to his complaint. When he complained to the station inspector, the sub-inspector and his team assaulted him and threatened that they would foist a false case against him. Tamilarasan suffered injuries and was treated at the government hospital.  He then filed a petition with Madurai city police commisisoner Prem Anand Sinha, detailing his ordeal at the hands of Tallakulam police and sought action against the personnel, according to the report. The commission has warned that if a report is not filed within three week, it may proceed to take action as it deems fit and proper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/shrc-seeks-report-from-madurai-cop-on-assault-on-doctor/articleshow/82058208.cms||---

According to data of new registrations with City and deputy RTO East office, Nagpur witnessed 43% slump in sale of new vehicles compared to last fiscal year. In 2019-20, both City and East transport department offices had registered 87,153 new vehicles as against 49,733 in the last financial year. “The dip in the sale figures was attributed to Covid-induced lockdown and major price hike effected buy automobile companies after B-VI migration,” said dealers. “Even the sale of two-wheelers was at record low, but demand for four-wheeler was not so bad,” said a senior transport department official who attributed it to the pandemic which has hit the salaried class more as they are considered to be the major buyers for two-wheelers in the city. An analysis of the data revealed that both the transport offices in the city have witnessed almost 46% decline in sale of two-wheelers. As against registration of 66,620 two-wheelers in 2019-20, it was 35,654 vehicles in the last fiscal year. The sale of four-wheelers witnessed over 8% slump in last financial year compared to 2019-20. In the last fiscal, the city had witnessed registration of 11,749 four-wheelers, while 12,812 new vehicles were registered in 2019-20, the data revealed. The slump also impacted sale of school buses very hard. In 2019-20, the city had registered 48 new buses, in last financial year the number was just 2. Even demand for ambulances was low. As against registration of 42 ambulances in 2019-20, the city witnessed only 21 vehicles registered as ambulances in 2020-21. Once a booming business, delivery vans too registered steep decline in demand — from 2,881 in 2019-20 to 964 in 2020-21. City auto dealers say year 2020-21 was the worst financial year in nearly 35 years and foresee another year of sluggish sale. “The ongoing pandemic situation or the economy will not improve overnight,” they point out. The global pandemic has dented sale of new vehicles in Nagpur even during last year’s Dussehra and Dhanteras, both the days considered very auspicious to make new purchases, especially vehicles. Even Gudi Padwa (which was celebrated on Tuesday) too is considered auspicious for new purchases, but the day did not witness any business due to Covid-19 restrictions imposed from April 6-30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-leaves-a-huge-dent-on-sale-of-new-vehicles/articleshow/82055632.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Nagpur||‘Collect Remdesivir from dealers directly’||Nagpur: In a revised order issued by the district collector on Tuesday, the Covid hospitals having payment code with the agent have been asked to collect their quota from the company's dealer directly while the share earlier alloted to them was diverted to others through different distributors. Earlier, district collector’s initiative to ensure smooth supply of anti-viral drug Remdesivir to Covid hospitals through distributors and stockists was derailed after one of the agencies of a pharmaceutical company failed to comply with the order owing to technical reasons. Several hospitals ran out of Remdesivir stock even after making hefty payments, as one of the agencies selected for supplying the drug could not release the vials as no payment codes were generated owing to no prior transactions with the agency. As the technical issue crept in, the hospital managements started clamouring for Remdesivir stock warranting an emergency intervention from the collector’s office. Sources in the distribution channel pointed out that in a few cases, Remdesivir stocks allotted to some hospitals were not claimed by the recipients. But, the stock could not be diverted to other hospitals due to the collector’s strict orders. Collector Ravindra Thakare had issued an order a couple of days ago urging distributors and stockists to deliver Remdesivir directly to Covid hospitals after collecting them from the carrying and forwarding agents of the pharmaceutical companies supplying the injections. The distribution was expected to get smoother with this, but the payments issue cropped up a fresh challenge. Late arrival of the stocks also has been a reason for the delayed allotment and distribution, say sources. “An officer of deputy collector rank had to rush to the agent and convince him to sort out the technical issue at the earliest and start distribution of Remdesivir to Covid hospitals,” said a senior official from the collector’s office. Meanwhile, Union minister Nitin Gadkari has requested central authorities to allow more manufacturers to bring the product in the market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/collect-remdesivir-from-dealers-directly/articleshow/82055888.cms||Soumitra Bose

In a communique sent to housing commissioner and all vice-chairpersons of development authorities, principal secretary (housing) Deepak Kumar said drives should be carried out in colonies which have not been handed over to the municipal corporations or other urban local bodies. “As part of the drive, colonies should be sanitized at least twice a week as per the standards set by the health department,” he said. Kumar said the authorities should also identify open plots and get them cleaned and sanitized. “If Covid cases are reported, containment zones be created and subsequently sanitized in coordination with the district administration and local bodies,” he added. The department has also sought setting up of Mohalla Nigrani Samitis in colonies which should be provided infrared thermometers, pulse oximeters and facemasks. The principal secretary workers at construction sites should be screened and their houses be sanitized.

State Congress president Girish Chodankar said that the party will launch a programme on April 15 to honour the contribution of loyal party workers. The initiative is called ‘Connecting Nizache Congressmen’ and will be rolled out in each of the 40 constituencies. “These ‘Niz Congressmen’ are assets and the energy of the party, and hence party leaders will go and meet them. We will visit all constituencies and spend time with our loyal workers, who are feeling that they are neglected by the party, and take suggestions from them for the party’s growth,” he said, while addressing reporters at Congress House after chairing a review meeting of the party’s office bearers recently. The coordination committee headed by former Union minister Ramakant Khalap also met to take stock of the ongoing membership drive and the efforts to overhaul the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-plans-outreach-to-woo-loyalists/articleshow/82055885.cms||---
---||Pune||No social distancing and temperature checks of passengers at Pune station||PUNE: The Pune railway station is witnessing heavy rush, with migrant workers heading home in anticipation of another lockdown, but little thought is being given by the authorities towards ensuring social distancing and carrying out temperature checks of passengers. On Monday afternoon, hundreds of passengers were seen waiting at the station for their trains. People entered the platforms without any monitoring or temperature checks. TimesViewPassengers, particularly migrant workers, crowding to catch trains back home has resulted in non-adherence of Covid protocols. This behaviour was witnessed last year too. A lapse can easily lead to a superspreader situation at the platforms. The railways should mobilize its staff and those from the RPF to ensure norms are followed.Chandreshwar Patel, a migrant worker, who was on his way to Uttar Pradesh, snapped back when asked about social distancing. “We are facing so many problems and you are concerned about social distancing. Isn’t it enough that I am wearing a mask?” he asked. A majority of passengers didn’t respond when asked about following social distancing regulation. However, Awdhesh Kumar, another passenger, said, “There are thousands of people who have assembled here for their trains. How is social distancing even possible? Moreover, if the government was so serious about adherence to Covid protocols, why aren’t they checking it here? It seems that they are in a hurry to just send us home.” While passengers entered platform number 1 from the main entrance, there was no one to check their temperature. Just beside the main gate, ‘Captain Arjun’, the robot developed by the railway protection force stood, and passengers were seen using digital thermometer attached to one of its arms, but no reading flashed on the display monitor. “One has to hold on for a second or two before the reading is shown. With no monitoring, the same is not happening,” an official at the station said. The official said it was not possible to screen each passenger because of the rush. “Temperature checks do happen but presently the crowd is just too much. Our officials are trying to ensure that social distancing norms are followed on the platforms,” the official said. Many additional special trains have been introduced to meet the heavy rush. Currently, Pune station witnesses around 138 train movements every day. Manoj Jhawar, public relations officer, Pune rail division, said that announcements regarding wearing of masks and maintaining social distancing were being made continuously. “Also, instructions regarding following Covid protocols are flashed on television screens at various stations. People should be responsible, too,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-social-distancing-and-temperature-checks-of-passengers-at-pune-station/articleshow/82056745.cms||Joy Sengupta

No conclusive decision on the matter was taken at the meet, and the board members are expected to meet again soon to review the matter. “The government may consider delaying the exams by 2-3 weeks but a final decision on it will only be announced later,” said sources in the state education board. In Gujarat, Class 10 and Class 12 board exams will be held from May 10 to May 25. As many as 17.5 lakh students participated in the board exams last year and this time the numbers are expected to be higher. The All Gujarat Vali Mandal in their representation to chief minister Vijay Rupani urged the government to postpone the exams to June. On Monday, the Maharashtra government decided to postpone Class 10 and Class 12 board examinations to May and June respectively. The Maharashtra government said it took the decision given the rise in Covid-19 cases in the past few days. As a result, there has been stress about preparing for exams, and the pandemic affecting the health of the stakeholders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gshseb-mulls-possibility-of-postponing-board-exams/articleshow/82059760.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Drug case: Name cleared, hunt at last for namesake||Ahmedabad: A city sessions court ordered to release a prisoner from Sabarmati Central Jail, after it was proved that he was arrested and put behind bars due to a case of mistaken identity. Additional district judge D V Shah ordered the release of Pavankumar Bansidhar Sharma (54) after the court was convinced that Sharma was not the original accused who was wanted in a 1987 drug peddling case, in which one Pavankumar Bansidhar Brahmin, 48 years of age then, was arrested with 15g of charas from near the gate of the metropolitan court in Gheekanta. Brahmin was released on bail in 1991 and did not return for the trial after that. Sharma was arrested on February 24 and sent to jail in the NDPS case, while he continued to claim that he was a victim of mistaken identity and he was not the person who the court had wanted to put on trial. After his arrest, Sharma requested the court to verify identification marks, which the court ordered earlier this month. Last week, the jail authority told the court that the body marks that the original accused had, as registered in the jail’s admission record of 1991, were missing from Sharma’s body. The scars on the original accused’s forehead, right side of his chest and elbow and a tattoo on his wrist were not found on Sharma’s body. Karanj PSI R G Bharwad, who had arrested Sharma from Rajasthan, argued that the scars could have disappeared with the passage of time. But the court refused to believe this and said that such marks may become lighter over the years, but would never disappear. The jail authority also reported to the court that Sharma’s height is 5’7”, whereas the original accused’s height was recorded as 5’5”. This led the court to reject the prosecution’s claim that Sharma was the original accused, who was earlier arrested and jailed under the name of Pavankumar Brahmin. PSI Bharwad submitted that the arrest was effected from Alwar in Rajasthan after verification of Sharma’s family members. Moreover, the signature samples of Sharma did not match with the signature put in the jail admission by the original accused in 1991. The court said that when compared under provisions of Section 7 of the Evidence Act, the signatures do not appear to be same and handwritings also do not bear any similarity. As this was not enough, the original complainant and the ex-PSI of Karanj D A Kapadia said that the age of the original accused was 48 when he was produced before the magistrate after his arrest. The court said, “There is a reason to believe that this applicant (Sharma) is not the original accused of the case.” The judge also said that the original accused should be 81 years of age now. After ordering the prisoner’s release, the court issued an arrest warrant against the original accused and a notice to the guarantor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/drug-case-name-cleared-hunt-at-last-for-namesake/articleshow/82057321.cms||---
---||Chennai||Centuries-old Trichy fest struck off calendar again||Apart from keeping people in constant fear, the pandemic continues to take a toll on their beliefs and happiness in gathering to celebrate festivals. At the Rockfort temple in Trichy, the annual Chithirai festivities are hit. The surge in Covid-19 cases has made the HR&CE department cancel the centuries-old ‘Settipen Maruthuvam’, which celebrates new life. Arulmigu Thayumanava Swamy temple on the Rockfort hillock, one of the major Saivite temples in south India, hosts the Chithirai festival for two weeks annually. Apart from the temple car festival, during which devotees pull the wooden car through the streets of the city, the conduct of ‘Settipen Maruthuvam’ a festival re-enacting the timely help of Lord Shiva to a pregnant woman, an ardent devotee, in childbirth is a significant event. Legend has it that a woman named Rathnavathi developed labour pain when she was alone at home. The Lord took the form of the pregnant woman’s mother to help his devotee to deliver a child, thus earning the name of the chief deity ‘Thayum Aanavar’ (he who became a mother). The event attracts pregnant women to the temple as a special herbal "legiyam" is prepared and distributed to women for healthy childbirth. "The legiyam has 18 herbs and popular among people staying abroad as well. Many source the legiyam through their relatives as it is believed to be healthy. The festival celebrated the reason for the lord’s name," says G Aravanaiselvan, a retired HR&CE official from Rockfort. Pregnant women attend the ritual at the stone hall at the base of the Rockfort temple in the belief that their childbirth will be smooth. "As the festivals were cancelled last year, we had wanted to participate this year. But at the last moment, the management has cancelled. We can conduct the festival by limiting footfall and following the restrictions," R Sundarrajan, a devotee from North street said. As another option, the devotees have sought the HR&CE to hold the rituals and relay the events through live streaming. "The decision to cancel festivals was taken based on the government’s instruction. Thousands of people gather and so it is difficult to implement the Covid-19 restrictions," a senior HR&CE official said. Settipen child delivery and temple car events were scheduled to be held on April 21 and April 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/centuries-old-trichy-fest-struck-off-calendar-again/articleshow/82058209.cms||Deepak Karthik

Despite a holiday on account of Gudi Padwa, 23,302 citizens took the jab in the division on Tuesday. These include 12,262 in Nagpur alone. Among them were 1,473 who took their second dose. Overall, Nagpur district achieved 75% of the day’s vaccination target, while the division achieved 70%. Chandrapur administered 7,642 vaccines in the day, followed by Bhandara 1,645. All districts in Vidarbha have now started campaign to increase vaccination, which is the only long term remedy to deal with Covid-19 spread. Vaccine availability is no more a problem now. As per the latest data released by the divisional health department, Nagpur city has stock of Covaxin expected to last up to 8 days and Covishield for six days. Overall, Nagpur division has stock of both the vaccines for 9 days. In Nagpur city, both Covaxin jab centres in GMCH reported more than 200% vaccination on Tuesday. IGR Hospital, Manewada UPHC where Covishield is being administered, also reported more than 200 jabs on Tuesday. Wednesday will be an important day, as it will be the last day before the 15-day restrictions to be imposed from April 15. Vaccination will continue even during the restrictions, but it has been past experience that response to vaccination declines with more strict restrictions on public movements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/jab-drive-gains-momentum-as-covid-fear-rises/articleshow/82055896.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Ahmedabad||Without enough men to work shifts, oxygen refillers struggle||Ahmedabad: During a weekly meeting of the state health department for all major municipalities and cities an official pointed out, “It’s not about how many more beds can be requisitioned for Covid care, but whether we can match with the oxygen cylinders requirement against that requisition which is a concern.” The desperation was felt in Ahmedabad on Tuesday as AMC officials in each zone desperately co-ordinated with state agencies to pressure oxygen refillers to ensure oxygen supply. “There are 12 major suppliers for Ahmedabad district. If they function 24x7, each can supply 1,100 cylinders daily. But refillers have begun complaining that they do not have adequate labour to work three shifts,” says a senior AMC official. A representation was made by a few oxygen refillers before AMC on the issue on Saturday last week. In Ahmedabad, even as the AMC continues to requisition mid-size hospitals and nursing homes for Covid care, a large problem awaits them in logistics. Most of these hospitals rely on oxygen cylinders. Almost 95% of the hospitals — that is 947 hospitals of the 985 registered within the AMC limits — have a capacity of 40 beds or less. Their total bed capacity adds up to 9,245 beds. Of these 947 hospitals, a large number — 688 hospitals — have below 10 beds. On usual days, the average requirement of below 30-bed hospitals is 9 to 10 cylinders for 6 to 8 ICU beds. The total combined bed capacity of below-10 bed hospital is 4,658. Now, as more hospitals among these mid-size hospitals sign up as Covid care centres, there is a surge in demand for oxygen cylinders. On Tuesday, it was calculated to be 11 times higher than on usual days. One can gauge the stress. Dealers are also finding it tough to find commercial vehicles to transport the cylinders to various parts of the city.

---||Ahmedabad||Toll haze in Gujarat: If comorbid, Covid death not counted?||AHMEDABAD: Crematoriums across the eight major cities of Gujarat are overflowing with the dead brought in according to Covid-19 protocols. In Ahmedabad on Monday, the waiting time to collect the bodies was eight hours and the bereaved kin had to endure eight more hours in line at the crematorium. In Rajkot on Tuesday morning, 59 deaths were reported from Covid hospitals. In Surat, makeshift crematoriums are being set up and one, shut for 15 years, was brought back to life to process the dead. Amid the emergence of such disquieting ground reports, the government data pegged the deaths on Monday at 55 and on Tuesday at 67. The mismatch between the data and the real-life scenes at the crematoriums have spurred serious questions about the veracity of the death figures. Social media is rife with demands that the state declare the ‘real’ figures. TOI spoke to a number of senior officials and medical professionals involved in the anti-Covid mission to understand the reasons for the discrepancy. A major factor is that Covid patients are broadly categorized as ‘Covid with no comorbidities’ and ‘Covid with comorbidities’. “It is true that more Covid patients are dying than the numbers released suggest,” said a senior health administrator. “While hospitals list out Covid victims with comorbidities, this number is not included in the final death toll published by the government.” Recently, CM Vijay Rupani had denied reports that the state government was hiding the true count of Covid fatalities. “As per the guidelines of the ICMR, if a comorbid patient dies then a committee of experts decides the primary and secondary causes of death,” he said. “If that committee identifies the main cause of death as heart attack, then even if the patient was infected, such a death is not counted as being caused by Covid. The same system is followed across the entire country.” The health administrator conceded that the government is citing ICMR guidelines. “But it is an open secret at Covid hospitals that any person who has listed comorbidities is not likely to be added to the Covid death statistics if the disease kills him,” the administrator said. “Comorbidities can include hypertension, diabetes, or heart disease.” The omission of comorbid people who constitute nearly 60% of Covid deaths is likely to bring down the stats, another senior health administrator said. “But as they are Covid positive, they reach crematoriums in line with the protocol,” he said. “That’s the main reason for more Covid dead in morgues than in state figures.” A senior government health official said: “The data of Covid dead is maintained in such a way that while the majority of the deceased with comorbidities are excluded from the toll figure, the breakup includes comorbidities to make the data look inclusive.” Experts have criticized the practice and say the government should release the numbers of all Covid casualties. “The government feels high death numbers will create panic but the ostrich-like approach does not work in a pandemic,” said a senior doctor involved with Covid care. “People should know the extent of the casualties to understand the importance of Covid-appropriate behavior.” Another senior doctor said: “Giving a false sense of well-being is not desirable in a pandemic. Every Covid death should be counted. That will push people to adopt better health behaviors.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/toll-haze-if-comorbid-covid-death-not-counted/articleshow/82056748.cms||---

The technology-enabled system will help ensure effective implementation of the mask rule. Police officials in the higher hierarchy will get alerts through a mobile application if the cameras capture a person without a mask.A police official said with higher officials supervising the situation on the ground, teams have to be more vigilant. It will also reduce arguments as pictorial evidence will be available while collecting the fine amount. People should wear masks not only to save their hard-earned money, but also to ensure safety of others.Sinha said that the number of cameras will be increased in other places in the days to come. “The city police is committed to ensure that public places are safer by ensuring mask and social distancing,” he said.With cases steadily rising in the second wave, police have joined the local body officials in collecting fines from mask violators. “Stringent action will be taken against people not wearing masks and shopkeepers for not ensuring social distancing on their premises,” Sinha said.Police have so far booked nearly 5,000 people violating mask rule in the last five days and collected Rs 200 from each of them. Shopkeepers who dont enforce social distancing among their customers are fined Rs 500.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-cops-to-rely-on-cctv-to-catch-those-without-mask/articleshow/82055903.cms||---

Thangavelu, a businessman from Ariyapithanpatti near Vedasandur in Dindigul, had incurred loss in 2019 and approached Sasikumar, an astrologer from Kaniyur in Tirupur district. He conducted a puja and charged Thangavelu Rs 1 lakh. In subsequent meetings, Sasikumar told Thangavelu that there is a treasure in the land that belongs to him and promised to find, which would fetch him gold worth crores of rupees. Believing his words, Thangavelu paid money in various instalments last year. He also gave him 44 sovereigns of gold jewellery. However, Sasikumar did not take any steps to find the treasure. When Thangavelu and his family members approached Sasikumar and asked him to return their money and jewellery a few months ago, he threatened them. When the issue was taken to the notice of the Vedasandur police two months ago, Sasikumar returned Rs 2 lakh. However, he refused to return the remaining amount and jewellery. Thangavelu approached the Dindigul district crime branch police, who registered a case and arrested Sasikumar on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/astrologer-cons-man-of-rs-22l-held/articleshow/82055900.cms||---
---||Goa||Calangute villagers seek answers on sewerage system||CALANGUTE: Villagers at the Calangute gram sabha last Sunday sought to know when the sewerage system, work on which had started more than seven years ago, would be made operational. Sarpanch Shawn Martins said that work has been delayed due to various reasons, and added that authorities are working on completing it at the earliest. While the sewerage treatment plant (STP) at Baga and the sewerage pipeline network in Calangute are ready, the system has not been made operational due to two pending components of the project: a reverse pipeline to take treated water from the STP to the garbage treatment plant (GTP) at Saligao, and a pumping station at Gauravaddo. The sewerage system was to be completed in April 2016 Talking to the media, recently, minister for ports and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo said the tendering process for the reverse pipeline has started and would be completed in the next two months. However, work on the pumping station at Gauravaddo (E) is going to be delayed as the land for the pumping station is yet to be identified, he said. “Every time we identify a place, people raise objections,” Lobo said. Although work had started on the pumping station at Gauravaddo (E) on land formerly belonging to the Shree Shantadurga Devasthan, it was abandoned in January following violent objections by the public. The reverse pipeline has been necessitated as discharge of the treated water from the STP at Baga into the Baga river was opposed by tourism stakeholders in the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/calangute-villagers-seek-answers-on-sewerage-system/articleshow/82055904.cms||---
---||Madurai||Norms flouted at fishing fest held after 10 yrs||Madurai: There were hundreds of them, young and old, jostling with each other in the receding water to cast their nets or even use bare hands to fish. But hardly any of them had a mask on their face not to speak of keeping social distance. The occasion was the fishing festival being held after a decade at the tank in Kottampatti near Melur on Monday. It was after 10 years that the drought-prone region had some water in the tank to hold the festival thanks to the copious north-east monsoon. Fishing festivals used to be a quintessential village function in the days of yore. Whenever the local tank starts drying, special rituals are performed to the village deity on one specific day. Thereafter, the villagers enter the tank in knee-deep water and try their hand at fishing using nets, clothes, baskets and even bare hands. The north-east monsoon last year had brought enough rain to fill the Kunnarapatti Rajaneri tank to the brim and fish to be introduced in it. Now, with summer advancing and the water beginning to dry up, the villagers decided to conduct the festival unmindful of the rising Covid-19 situation. Local leaders threw the first net and villagers entered the tank in one go. All of them had brought their nets and baskets but not come masked and maintaining social distancing was next to impossible. “We caught a variety of fish including rohu, catla and keluthi and they were big in size this time,” said Pandi, who had also invited his friends from neighbouring villages. V P Manikandan, a social activist, said that festivals which were part of local culture should be allowed, but this time it risked spreading the coronavirus. A village which wanted to conduct festivals should be asked to get vaccinated completely ahead of the festival. It is important that the people are also aware of the danger of the disease, he said. Officials like tahsildar and BDO should take up the responsibility of ensuring enforcement, especially during festivals, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/norms-flouted-at-fishing-fest-held-after-10-yrs/articleshow/82055909.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘2-minutes’ kidnap lands man in jail for 6 months||MUMBAI: In a trial that took 20 days, a 22-year-old man, who kidnapped a five-year-old girl for “2 to 3” minutes before being apprehended by her father who was near their house parking his bike while she waited at the gate, has been convicted and sentenced to six months of rigorous imprisonment. The incident took place in October 2020. While the accused claimed he had picked up the child out of concern as she was alone, the court refuted this after having found through the child’s deposition that he did not ask her any questions before walking away with her. However, refusing to grant the maximum sentence of seven years of imprisonment, the court held the accused had not deliberately come to the spot to take the child, but finding her alone at 11 pm, he decided to take her away. The court also said no untoward incident had taken place. “Considering these aspects and his family background that he is the only bread-earner of his family…it is just and proper to impose upon him six months’ rigorous imprisonment with fine of Rs 1,000,” the court said. The accused was acquitted of offences under the Pocso Act. “Carrying the victim girl, holding her hand, in such circumstances cannot be said to have been done only with a sexual intention or to outrage her modesty. The prosecution has failed to prove that the accused had touched her either intending to outrage her modesty or with sexual intention,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-min-kidnap-lands-man-in-jail-for-6-mths/articleshow/82057465.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Pandemic peaks: 18,021 cases in 24 hours in UP||LUCKNOW: After a marginal fall on Monday, Covid-19 cases broke all previous records on Tuesday. According to data from the state government, 18,021 cases were reported in the state in the past 24 hours, taking the tally to 7,23,582. Lucknow continued to be the biggest contributor with 5,382 entries. The surge in Prayagraj and Varanasi also turned bigger. The two districts recorded 1,856 and 1,404 new cases respectively. Kanpur Nagar (1271) and Gorakhpur (602) were the other two contributors in the top five which accounted for over 58% (10,515 cases) of the total burden for the day. The spike increased the number of active infections to 95,980 of which 49,163 are under treatment at a government or a private hospital. How the unprecedented surge has pulverised the health infrastructure could be gauged from the fact that the number of hospitalisations has recorded a 631 % increase since April 1 when the total number of persons under treatment at a hospital was just 6,722. It also indicated that cumulatively, over 50% of the active cases were in need of the hospital setting for management of their condition. “The virus is spreading very fast unlike last year. Therefore prevention is what we have in our hands. Everyone must wear a mask and those entitled must get them vaccinated,” said state surveillance officer, UP Dr Vikasendu Agarwal. The loss of lives due to the pandemic continued to increase for the fifth consecutive day. As many as 85 persons succumbed to the complications caused by the virus, taking the total number of casualties to 9309. Lucknow (18), Kanpur (10) and Prayagraj (8) remained the top contributors. Meanwhile, additional chief secretary health and family welfare Amit Mohan Prasad informed that the state government was making efforts to increase the tests and add more beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pandemic-peaks-18021-cases-in-24-hours-in-up/articleshow/82056769.cms||Shailvee Sharda

GSIA president Damodar Kochkar said that as an industry body, it wants to support the stand taken by the state government. GSIA urged the government not to succumb to pressure tactics, but instead, adopt a long-term approach that is in the interest of the state and its tourism sector. “We don’t have proper public transport in Goa so there must be an affordable service for those who visit the state,” Kochkar said. “If Goa wants to promote tourism then this kind of service is a must. The All Goa Taxi Owners’ Association, along with many taxi drivers, have been agitating and demanding that the government should shut down GoaMiles. The government on the other hand has issued a stern warning to the taxi operators to install digital meters, which the taxi operators are not willing to do. With the state government yet to agree to the demands of the taxi operators, the latter have begun an agitation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gsia-bats-for-app-based-taxi-services/articleshow/82055908.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Green activist Bandu Dhotre offers to quit wildlife board||Nagpur: At a time when getting into state-level committees and wildlife board is considered to be prestigious, Bandu Dhotre, founder of Eco-Pro, an ecological protection organization from Chandrapur, has offered to quit the state board for wildlife (SBWL). In a communication to the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who is also chairman of the SBWL, Dhotre said he would better prefer to be district honorary wildlife warden than an SBWL member. Working for wildlife conservation for the last 17 years in the district, Eco-Pro had never sought to be on the board. This is for the second consecutive term the NGO-member was appointed to the wildlife board. Dhotre was first appointed as honorary wildlife warden in 2012, and considering his good work as warden he was appointed to the SBWL for the first time in 2016. Last year his NGO was appointed again to the wildlife board. “I was not inclined to be an SBWL member and rather had applied for honorary wildlife warden as the post gives me a better opportunity to work at the ground level in trouble-torn Chandrapur district, where human-animal conflict is at its peak and last year 35 people died in tiger and leopard attacks,” said Dhotre. “While working during conflict and rescue operations I come in contact with many villagers and stakeholders. As a warden, I’ve coordinated well with various government agencies and departments like WCL, MSEDCL, police, revenue, people’s representatives, zilla parishad, who also have a key role to play in resolving conflict. I feel I will work better as a warden,” says Dhotre. Chandrapur chief conservator of forests (CCF) NR Praveen says, “Dhotre’s name was recommended for district honorary warden but owing to ‘one person one post’ his name did not find in the list announced last month. There are others too who were honorary wardens earlier but last year made it to the SBWL, and hence were not chosen as district wardens. Last week. I’ve sent Dhotre’s proposal to the chief wildlife warden who will take a call.” The appointment of honorary wildlife wardens in Chandrapur district has been lopsided this time. For the sensitive district, only one wildlife warden has been appointed and he hails from Bramhapuri which is 100km from Chandrapur. There is a need for more wardens for the tiger district. Dhotre has appealed to the chief minister to cancel his appointment to the SWBL and retain him as honorary wildlife warden so that better coordination is effected between the forest department, people and communities to handle conflict, relocation of villages, corridor conservation, rapid rescue of animals etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/green-activist-bandu-dhotre-offers-to-quit-wildlife-board/articleshow/82055905.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Nagpur||State set to enforce bond service for 2,900 new doctors||Nagpur: State department of medical education and research is all set to enforce the one year mandatory bond service requirement strictly for the MBBS doctors who have completed their internships this year. Doing this will mean that 2,900 doctors, who have the experience of working in government Covid-19 hospitals during the pandemic year, will be available for placements in Government hospitals, Covid hospitals, and jumbo Covid facilities to be established in many districts now. TOI had reported on April 4 that the crisis of trained doctors can be resolved if the state strictly implements the bond service rule. RTI and healthcare activist Amrut Bang had suggested the same to the state Government. Now, the department of higher and technical education has confirmed to TOI that the procedure is under way. “These students will be available for service soon. We will inform public health department for their suitable placements and ensure availability of doctors,” said Saurabh Vijay, secretary for medical education and drug department. “We are also facilitating registration of nurses, new doctors for faster engagement,” he added. Director of the medical education and research Dr T P Lahane has also started taking steps towards implementation of bond rule. “We have received assurance from state government that our suggestions have been accepted. Bond service is mandatory and in pandemic situation, government can be strict about it,” said Bang. Minister of medical education Amit Deshmukh had stated earlier this week that he was planning to bring 5,200 doctors into the field as soon as the results of MBBS examinations will be out. According to experts, these doctors will come into service in regular course and nothing special needs to be done for this. “Those who complete their MBBS will be available for internships by routine process. But they can be deployed only in their respective medical colleges. Whereas, the 2,900 doctors serving their bond period can be deployed even in rural Maharashtra,” said Bang. Sources in the medical education department told TOI a resolution in this regard was likely to be issued after April 15. Many districts, including Chandrapur in Vidarbha are planning to have jumbo Covid facilities. The decision will make health manpower available for such infrastructure. Solving health manpower crisis 2,900| MBBS doctors will be available for state-wide posting under bond service 5,200| Fresh MBBS pass outs will join their respective colleges for 1 year internships 15,000| nurses who have completed internship will be registered for service immediately||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-set-to-enforce-bond-service-for-2900-new-doctors/articleshow/82038897.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Tuesday’s tally was below the optimum numbers—nearly four lakh for Maharashtra and around 60,000 for Mumbai—seen before the stockouts last week forced curtailed vaccination, but officials are hopeful that the drive will intensify again. “We plan to take the number higher by increasing the number of vaccination centres in the city over the next few days,” said BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. At present, the city has 121 vaccination centres, and the BMC wants to increase the number of beneficiaries to 1 lakh a day. Kakani said the BMC at present has nearly 2.3 lakh doses of Covishield vaccine and 47,000 doses of the Covaxin. “Even if we keep getting supply at the present pace, we should be able to scale up slowly,” said Kakani. Of the 45,524 who turned up for vaccination in Mumbai, 28,792 belonged to the 45-59 age group. The second biggest group of recipients was the senior citizens at 12,684. Since the vaccination began on January 16, the city has so far managed to give 17.5 lakh vaccine shots. More than a third of these shots have been given to senior citizens—almost 6.9 lakh. Around 5.2 lakh of the 45-59 age group have managed to take the vaccine since the drive started for this group on April 1. The city may complete 1 lakh Covaxin shots on Wednesday. So far, 95,415 have taken the Covaxin shot in the city; on Tuesday, 928 took the Covaxin jab. With 3.3 lakh people getting vaccinated across the state on Tuesday, the number of vaccine doses given out in Maharashtra has climbed to 1.05 crore so far. Like Mumbai, the 45-59 age group witnessed the highest turnout of 1.9 lakh, followed by senior citizens at over 1.1 lakh. Meanwhile, former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’s office sent out a statement saying that Maharashtra has received nearly 1.3 crore vaccine so far. While total consumption, including wastage, stands at nearly 1.1 crore, the state has 18.3 lakh doses as on April 13. Another 2 lakh doses are in the pipeline, said the communication. Meanwhile, India crossed the 11-crore vaccination mark on Tuesday, with 25 lakh people taking the shot. “While 45,000 Covid vaccination centres on an average are functional on any given day, 67,893 were operational on Tuesday,” said a central release. “Workplace vaccinations have also enabled such a high turnout of beneficiaries,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-3l-take-shot-in-state-45k-in-city-bmc-plans-more-vaccine-centres/articleshow/82056782.cms||Malathy Iyer

Meanwhile, fresh cases continue to rise in the state and till Monday night, the active caseload in Jharkhand stood at 15,343. JAC secretary Mahip Singh said they are gearing up to conduct the examination as per schedule, adding all directives issued by the state government will be adhered to. He said, “Even though the Covid situation has deteriorated in the past one month, we had planned to face the worst situation right from the beginning.” Singh stated that there would be adequate safety measures for examinees and the staff. He mentioned that proper identification of Covid-infected persons at the entrance of examination centres, observance of social distancing norms and other measures like frequent hand washing and sanitization will be implemented at each centre. He added that the responsibility of implementing the safety norms will be on the deputy commissioners. Singh said around 800 more centres have been formed for the examinations in order to ensure social distancing. It may be stated here that around seven lakh students are expected to appear for the examinations at 2,150 centres. Meanwhile, a significant number of CBSE students have urged the government to postpone the examinations of Classes X and XII in view of the Covid situation. Several politicians have also backed the demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/no-plans-to-defer-board-exams-says-jac-secy/articleshow/82054926.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Health system falls apart in Ranchi, Covid spike sparks ‘medical loot’||RANCHI: An elderly Covid patient from Hazaribag died waiting for hours for a bed outside Ranchi sadar hospital on Tuesday at the same time when state health minister Banna Gupta conducted a surprise inspection of this health facility. In the last seven days, at least half a dozen patients have succumbed in Ranchi after they failed to get admission to hospitals. Healthcare and Covid management machinery in the state capital have collapsed as the number of new infections continue to surge in the city and across the state. Patients are dying after failing to get hospital beds and those in home isolation are struggling to get their samples collected for testing. Contact tracing, one of the key requirements to curb the virus spread, seems to have stopped going by the experiences of many infected persons. In a scenario like this, both government and private healthcare facilities are indulging in, what people say, is “medical emergency looting” Those who are able to get access to home collection facilities after hectic efforts are forced to pay beyond the government prescribed rate of Rs 600 for private labs. Technicians at government-run labs, where testing is supposed to be free, are demanding a baksheesh of Rs 500 for sample collection, without any guarantee of when the result will arrive. A patient had to pay Rs 2,000 for an ambulance to ferry him to Rims from Kusum Vihar in Morhabadi to Rims less than 2km away. A Morhabadi resident who is in home isolation after getting infected in the last week of March, said he has been struggling to arrange for at-home test for four days. “None of the private labs are responding to calls and incident commanders I contacted expressed their inability to arrange for tests. Am I supposed to go out for re-testing?,” he said, adding that contrary to the claims made by the Ranchi district administration about keeping tabs on home isolation patients, no one ever approached him seeking his health parameters or other queries as part of contact tracing efforts. Backlog of samples are also leading the spike in the infection. For instance, a 36-year-old Pallav Kumar of AG Colony in Doranda, whose sample was collected at Ranchi airport on April 8 upon returning from Maharashtra, received a positive report only on Tuesday morning. He has been mingling with other family members since his return. “I did not face any health issues, but I kept myself isolated for two days in anticipation of the report. How long can anyone keep themselves isolated waiting for the report?” he asked, fearing that other members in the family too may have been infected by now. Atul Gera, a noted health activist based in Ranchi who works in the field of blood donation, maintained that the entire health system has run into chaos and people are finding no avenues to get help. “I am coming across numerous instances of overcharging and medical loot in every sector, be it getting ambulance, testing and treatment among others. There is no place to report and seek help. I have also come across instances where timeliness of your Covid report depends on the amount you agree to pay to the lab technician,” he said. Appealing to the government to take over the entire health infrastructure of private hospitals to streamline things, Gera said, “The only way the government can control the chaos is by taking over entire testing, admission, discharge and payments facilities of private hospitals as part of resource optimization. Such is the horrific condition now that for everything you require high level recommendation and even that does not guarantee timely help,” he said.  Speaking to TOI, health minister Banna Gupta expressed ignorance about overcharging by private labs for testing but said the department is trying its best to control the situation. “That is the reason I began my surprise inspection,” he said. The opposition BJP on the other hand demanded the government declares a health emergency in Jharkhand. State BJP president Deepak Prakash said he has written to chief minister Hemant Soren asking him to call an all-party meeting. “The rise in infections and the government’s response is inversely proportional. People are falling prey to mismanagement and chaos. It is high time the government declares a health emergency and convene an all-party meeting to work out ways to tackle the crisis,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/health-system-falls-apart-in-ranchi-covid-spike-sparks-medical-loot/articleshow/82054825.cms||ASRP Mukesh

In the highest-ever single-day spike in the number of cases since the pandemic had started in Jharkhand last year, Koderma district on Monday had recorded 125 new cases, taking the active caseload to 574. As many as 884 samples were tested for Covid, pushing the positivity rate to around 14% in the district. Between March 22 and March 28, the district’s positivity rate hovered around 1.05%, which rose to 2.2% between March 29 and April 4 and further to 5.6% between April 5 and April 11 and Monday could arguably be called the worst day in the district since the inception of the pandemic. Gholap said, “The administration will take all measures to break the chain of the infection in the district. We have arranged 50 additional beds at the Covid Care Centre, making it 250-bed hospital. A separate 200-bed centre at the Engineering College building in Koderma is also being set up.

A total of 18 people died by suicide in January, with the figure almost doubling to 34 in February and 38 in March. In the first 14 days of April, 10 people killed themselves. Of the 100 deaths, 65 were men below 45 years of age, 25 were both men and women above 45 years and 10 were teenagers. Jeevan officials apprehend situation would aggravate further if no serious intervention is made at this point of time. Jeevan founder Mahavir Ram said, “Since February, reports of the rise in Covid cases have been coming in from different states and from mid-March we started experiencing increase a spike in our district. We believe made people anxious and apprehensive about their social and financial security and affected their mental condition.” He said petty issues are driving people to take the extreme step because of the weak mental health caused by COVID induced fear and anxiety. Veteran psychiatric Mahesh Hembram said obsessive compulsive disorder will phase out from the minds of the people with the end of Covid. "Jamshedpur is an industrial town and the economy of the zone is linked to the industries. The element of fear and anxiety is palpable in the minds of the working age people who have experienced lockdowns," he said. In 2020, a total of 252 people, including 168 men and 84 women, had died by suicide. Of these, 207 people below the age of 45. Also, last year, 20 distress calls per day on an average were made to Jeevan from June to September. This year, the centre has received an average of 12 distress calls a day in the past three weeks. In a letter to DC Suraj Kumar, Jeevan officials sought help to publicise of helpline numbers (9955377500, 9955435500) on long term basis through hoardings. It also requested for the printing and distribution of 1,000 posters and 10,000 handbills with the numbers and a message to the people that depression is treatable and suicides are preventable. The organisation has urged the administration to help line up various social groups for virtual meetings aimed at spreading information about ways to remain free of stress. "The pandemic is an important factor causing depression, anxiety and fear among people, particularly men below 45 years of age. Job losses and financial problems were the major cause of the suicides last year. The DC has always been cooperative and takes interest in our activities. Encouraged by his support, we have requested for help to check suicides, which has become uncontrollable in 2021," said Jeevan director Jeoraj Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/mental-health-experts-blame-2nd-wave-for-jsr-suicide-spike/articleshow/82054899.cms||B Sridhar

Fitting appointments will be rolled out from the end of next week following which operators of public transport vehicles, such as buses, taxis etc can install the device. “Initially, we were to fit the devices on the 30 electric KTC vehicles. These buses already have a tracking device and need not have a digital meter. The other buses however require the fitment. Following the completion of this, we will start adding more vehicles towards the end of next week,” transport director Rajan Satardekar said. He said that the devices may cost less for buses however, since it will have a fare meter and printer attached, it will cost more for taxi fitments. Following installation, the reimbursement scheme for devices costing between Rs 8000-10,000, will be issued to operators. “We will first start scheduling appointments for them to get the digital meters fitted. The reimbursement scheme will be rolled out in a month’s time,” Satardekar said. TOI had earlier reported that the state government will bear the cost of installing the meters for the first six months, as per a statement made by transport minister, Mauvin Godinho. Stating that the decision to offer the digital meters for free is an effort to ease the financial burden, Satardekar said, “I expect all taxi operators to install the meters within this time (six months).” Taxi operators recently agreed to get digital meters installed for their taxis on condition that fares should be hiked. Their contention is that the rates were last fixed in 2014 and since then, fuel prices have gone up drastically. While installation of digital meters was delayed in Goa, in March, Godinho said there are backhand services that must be completed to monitor, track the vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dates-for-digital-meter-fitting-from-next-week/articleshow/82039009.cms||---

The tribunal held that the structures are in violation of environmental laws and therefore, the right against eviction of a mundkar cannot be evoked in the matter. “We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant. She submitted that the appellant was a mundkar and is protected under the Goa, Daman and Diu Mundkar (Protection from Eviction) Act, 1975. It was explained that the mundkars were occupants with the permissions of the bhatkars (original owners) and they could not be evicted under the mundkarial law. The issue for consideration is not resolution of dispute between mundkars and bhatkars but of legality of constructions in violation of CRZ regulations framed under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986,” the NGT noted. The appeal before the NGT had been filed by the violators against orders issued by the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA). In January, the GCZMA had ordered the violators to remove the structures and restore the land at Candolim to its original state. The authority had also warned that the structures would be demolished by the deputy collector if they were not removed by those occupying them. After verification with the help of the directorate of settlement and land records, the GCZMA had found that the constructions in the CRZ area were not seen in the maps up to the year 1997, prompting the authority to conclude that they were constructed after the CRZ Notification of 1991, in violation of laws. “Any construction in the no-development zone and without statutory permission of GCZMA after enforcement of the CRZ Notification, 1991 in the CRZ area has to be demolished. The GCZMA has found the constructions to be after 1991,” the NGT ruled. Therefore, the direction by the authority to restore the land to its original condition as it existed prior to 1991, cannot be held to be illegal, the NGT order stated. It was also found that the illegal extensions were being used to run commercial activities. “Business activities in violation of the CRZ Notification can not be allowed as protection is only to the residential building that existed prior to the CRZ Notification, 1991, and not to commercial activities,” the NGT order stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rights-of-mundkar-different-from-legality-of-construction-rules-ngt/articleshow/82056167.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

However, only 588 of these layout owners have come forward to regularise their layouts under the layout regularisation scheme (LRS). Most of these unauthorised layouts have sprung up in Vizianagaram district. Sources say that some people are still waiting for the government to further extend the deadline of LRS, which originally closed in December last year. VMRDA officials are now forwarding the details of these unauthorised layouts to the registration department to prevent registrations, apart from initiating action on their own. Vizianagaram has emerged as a popular housing destination in recent years for various reasons including the proposed Bhogapuram airport, affordable and lucrative prices, and growth happening in the bordering areas of Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram districts. Several real estate developers have converted agricultural land into layouts without obtaining permission from the development authority. The middle-classes are lured by low prices where a 100 square yard land parcel sells for as low as Rs 5 lakh in rural parts of Vizianagaram district. While the development of plots in approved layouts is limited to around 60 cents of an acre, the unauthorised layout developers sell more than 80 cents of land as they do not conform with stipulated guidelines or zoning regulations. The majority of these layouts would not have no proper roads, open spaces, electricity lines or provision of other utilities. Moreover, some buyers may lose their plots, if the layout owner or the buyers on their own go for regularisation as they have to adhere to all infrastructural and spacing norms. At the end of the day, buyers may have to cough up the LRS charges too. A VMRDA urban planning official informed that the development authority has initiated action against the unauthorised layouts. “We have issued notices to these developers, asking them why we should not demolish the structures or the layouts. As the LRS deadline is already over, we cannot take any fresh applications for regularisation,” said the official. In all, VMRDA received 6,206 applications under the LRS scheme, including from the individual plot owners and old applications.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vmrda-identifies-919-unauthorised-layouts/articleshow/82054691.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh govt to release water for early kharif||NELLORE: In a move that could keep farmers in upland areas in the district on cloud nine, the state government has decided to release water for early kharif. With Somasila and Kandaleru brimming with water, water resources department has readied blueprint for the release of water to the entire ayacut in the district and sought the state government’s clearance. Water resources minister Anil Kumar Yadav, who hails from the district, has directed senior officials to take a call on the issue keeping in view of the enforcement of model code of the conduct due to the upcoming Tirupati Lok Sabha constituency by-election. Since four of the seven assembly segments of Tiruapati constituency are in Nellore district, the public representatives including ministers from the district decided to keep away from making the formal announcement on the water release. Sources said that engineer-in-chief Narayana Reddy has given the green signal for release of water from both Somasila and Kandaleru projects after discussing the issue with project officials in Nellore. Sources said that about 6 lakh acres are expected to get water for kharif for the first time in history. Although, technically it is called kharif, it is in reality the second crop in the district as the first crop in the district is cultivated during November-December. About 58 tmc water is available in Somasila project and 48 tmc water is available in Kandaleru reservoir. Sources said that about 62 tmc of water would be spared for the crops under both the projects from the total available waters. “About 4 lakh acres under Somasila and 2 lakh acres under Kandaleru project would get water for the kharif season,” said a senior official of water resources department. Saving about 16 tmc of water for drinking water needs, nearly 42 tmc of water from Somasila project would be allocated for agriculture needs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-to-release-water-for-early-kharif/articleshow/82054699.cms||Samdani MN

The conviction rate in cybercrime cases has gone through ups and downs in the state. It stood at 5.4% in both 2017 and 2019 but had gone up to 19.2% in 2019. As many as 1,983 cybercrime cases were reported in the state in 2020, a majority of them from Vizag and Vijayawada cities. In 2018, a total of 802 cybercrime cases went to trial, including cases from previous years. In 2019, 56 cases went to trial of which only three ended in conviction. Speaking to TOI, Vizag cybercrime police station inspector RVRK Choudhary said that cybercrimes nearly doubled in course of the pandemic in 2020. On the other hand, the pandemic also hit investigations as cops could not visit other states leading to a pendency of cases, said the inspector. Among cases that did end in conviction, a noteworthy one was when a district court in Visakhapatnam sentenced 45-year-old Subhash Mohan Chadha to eight years of rigorous imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 2.1 lakh. Chadha had duped 20-year-old Jitendra Singh, the son of a naval officer, to the tune of Rs 92,000 in 2010. The victim had killed himself. A senior police official, on condition of anonymity, said that 1,200–1,300 cybercrimes are reported in Andhra Pradesh every year, but charge-sheet is filed in only 30–40% cases while remaining cases remain under investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/cybercrime-convictions-continue-to-remain-low/articleshow/82054711.cms||Nalla.Babu

The government will lease out land available with the Shilparamams to private developers for construction of convention centres, hotels and resorts to attract more tourists. The master plans for the Srikakulam and Anantapur projects have received government approval. Taking the delay in development of the Shilparamam projects into consideration, the government has decided to rope in private developers. “In fact, the move will not only attract investments but also help create demand for crafts from the state,” said industries minister Mekapati Gautham Reddy. The government will shortly invite bids from prospective investors. Investments will be allowed even in recreational projects, including children’s parks. The developers would be allowed to collect entry fee for the particular theme project. The government will also allow Andhra Pradesh State Handloom Weavers Cooperative Society Limited (Apco), AP handicrafts and women self-help groups to set up their shops in the upcoming Shilparamam projects. Special chief secretary Rajath Bhargava said these outlets would help attract more visitors to the Shilparamams and also give revenue to artisans. He said Apco and the handicrafts corporation would also make additional revenues from the sales. Meanwhile, the society of Shilparamams has decided to construct shops to facilitate more women self-help groups in different districts.

Describing the event as an “internal matter of the BJP parivar” Chodankar said Congress will continue to focus on rebuilding the party from the grassroots level. While walking out of the NDA, GFP president Vijai Sardesai called on all anti-BJP parties to form an alliance under the banner of “Team Goa” to take on the BJP in the 2022 assembly elections. The GFP chief has been trying to corral a united political opposition against the BJP for months but the moves have been rebuffed by one of the factions within Congress. On Tuesday, Sardesai even said that he is willing to talk to Chodankar to convince him of the need for an alliance. “The dynamics of politics is changing. People in future will prefer only those with integrity, commitment and loyalty to a particular cause or ideology,” Chodankar said when asked what he thought about Sardesai’s offer. “The days of turncoats and party hoppers, which has hurt Goa very badly, are long over.” Opposition leader Digambar Kamat was busy campaigning for the municipal elections and was unavailable for a comment. Sardesai also said that the results of the civic polls, where Congress and GFP have come together, will indicate what voters think about an alliance. Not surprisingly, the Congress party’s student wing president welcomed GFP’s decision. State president of the National Students’Union of India (NSUI) Ahraz Mulla said that by moving out of the NDA, the opposition will be able to take on the state government much more aggressively. “Much needed to aggressively go ahead with Team Goa against BJP. Across the nation, the BJP is losing its allies looking at their false promises and their double standards,” Mulla said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/congress-calls-gfps-move-to-quit-nda-an-internal-matter/articleshow/82056196.cms||---

Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav said the fact a police constable had "categorically seen and identified" Rashid at a place where a medical shop was being vandalised and looted on February 25, 2020, is "hardly of any consequence" as he didn't report the matter immediately. "Being a cop, what stopped him from reporting the matter then and there at the police station or to bring the same to the knowledge of higher police officers? This casts serious doubt on the credibility of the said police witness," the court said. Rashid was booked and arrested on various charges, including rioting. His counsel argued that the court had already granted bail to seven co-accused earlier. Riots: Bail given on ‘parity’The applicant is neither specifically named in the FIR nor any specific role has been alleged against him in the matter,” the counsel of the accused argued in court. The special public prosecutor opposed the bail plea, stating Rashid was initially not named as the complainant was scared but named him later. Rashid was stated to be involved in other cases besides this one. Besides, the prosecution also relied on a CCTV footage to substantiate its claims. The court, however, said: “No CCTV/video footage of 25.02.2020 (on which date the incident in question took place) has been placed on record... The applicant was not arrested from the spot, instead his arrest has been formally affected in the present case on 20.04.2020 (i.e after lapse of about 55 days of the date of incident) in Mandoli Jail,” it added. The order further observed, “Prima facie the role assigned to applicant in the matter appears to be on same/identical footing as the aforesaid co-accused persons. As such, I am of the considered opinion that the applicant is entitled for grant of bail in the matter on the ground of parity.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-witness-not-credible-man-gets-bail-in-delhi-rioting-case/articleshow/82058232.cms||---

The temple administration, after stopping the sale of mineral water in plastic bottles in Tirumala, opened ‘jala prasadam’ drinking water points at several places in the hill town to ensure that adequate drinking water was available for devotees. However, some devotees are still found to be carrying plastic water bottles. TTD health officer Dr RR Reddy appealed to devotees trekking along the Alipiri and Srivari pedestrian routes to Tirumala to carry reusable water bottles. “We have noticed that some devotees carry plastic water bottles and later throw them on the side of the road. Devotees should make use of the dustbins set up at various places and should carry their own reusable water bottles when coming to Tirumala,” he said. He further pointed out that the TTD has set up 88 ‘jala prasadam’ units across Tirumala for the convenience of devotees, through which over 4.4 lakh litres of filtered water is made available to pilgrims every day. Meanwhile, Ugadi Asthanam was celebrated on a grand note at the Lord Venkateswara temple on Tuesday. Devotees attach a great deal of significance to the annual ritual which marks the beginning of the Telugu new year. After ‘visesha samarpana’ was rendered to Lord Malayappa Swamy and goddesses Sridevi and Bhudevi in the morning, the deities were taken out in a procession around the vimana prakaram inside the main temple complex, following which Ugadi Asthanam was performed at Bangaru Vakili (golden entrance) by agama exponents. Earlier, Panchanga Shravanam was rendered by a vedic scholar describing the fortunes which may unfold for all in 2021-22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/dont-carry-plastic-water-bottles-to-tirumala-ttd/articleshow/82054755.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

The poet-writer’s literary works are considered classics in Telugu literature and reflect the progressive thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi, Karl Marx and Swami Vivekananda on industrialisation and development,” recalled Venkatappaiah, who secured a doctorate from the University of Madras. Addepalli published 13 anthologies of poetry and 25 books on literary criticism and was known as ‘Praja Kavi’, or people’s poet. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/tributes-paid-to-praja-kavi/articleshow/82054764.cms||---

According to sources, the draft bill has been submitted to the state government for consideration and passage through the state legislative assembly. Once the legislation is passed and notified, the Goa, Daman and Diu Fire Force Act will be repealed. “The department has forwarded the bill and it is now with the government to take a call,” director of fire services Ashok Menon said. According to the department’s vision document, the bill is expected to get the assembly’s approval by 2021, while the rules and notification under the bill should come by September. “At the national level they have formulated a model fire and emergency bill. There are new sections that have been added pertaining to fires, e-governance and public safety. We saw what is lacking in our Act and have incorporated what is required,” Menon said. He said the new bill will bring uniformity across all states with regards to fire safety. A department source said that though the bill and its rules are high priority, the implementation depends on timely clearance, particularly administrative approvals and expenditure sanction by the state government. Sources said the legislation for the bill has been pending for two years due to a delay in administrative clearances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/new-fire-emergency-bill-awaits-clearance-by-govt/articleshow/82056260.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Markaz case: DDMA order not enforced uniformly, HC told||The DDMA order prohibits any kind of social, religious, political or festive congregation or gathering in the capital. The HC’s direction came after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the government, submitted that no permission for more than 20 persons should be given in the light of the spike in Covid cases. Objecting to the SG’s stand, senior advocate Ramesh Gupta questioned why huge gatherings and queues were seen outside temples and how lakhs of people were allowed to converge at Uttarakhand for the Kumbh. Gupta alleged that the DDMA order was not being implemented uniformly and asked if it applied only to a particular religious community. Times ViewAt a time when the country is in the midst of a massive and deeply worrying second Covid wave— and state govts and civic administrations are announcing night curfews and lockdown-like curbs — there can be no second opinion about the need to limit the size of public gatherings, whether social, political or religious. But these curbs must be applied uniformly, without fear or favour. How can anyone reconcile the images of tens of lakhs of people of one faith freely gathering in defiance of Covid norms — without any social distancing and with few wearing masks — with the government’s insistence on a cap of 20 for entry to a place of worship of another faith?He also urged the court to permit, as an interim measure for a day, at least 50 persons to offer prayers at the mosque. But the HC declined the request at this stage. “Let them file an affidavit. If they have not closed all religious congregations at temples and churches, then this will also open. Yesterday, the inspection was for limited purpose to check if the mosque can open for slightly more gathering than what’s permitted now,” Justice Gupta remarked. In its status report the police said that local SHO, along with representatives of Delhi Waqf Board, visited the site. “The 1st floor, which is earmarked as Bangley Wali masjid and is the designated area for offering Namaaz by devotees, comprises 91ft by 60ft. Keeping in view directives by DDMA, even after following social distancing, any gathering of more than 20 people would result in formation of a religious and festival-related congregation which is currently barred,” the report said. The board has contended that even after unlock-1 guidelines permitted religious places outside containment zones to be opened, the markaz continues to be locked up. It further contended that even if the premises was part of any criminal investigation, keeping it “under lock as an out of bound area” was a “primitive method” of inquiry process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/markaz-case-ddma-order-not-enforced-uniformly-hc-told/articleshow/82058238.cms||---
---||Surat||Surat Municipal Corporation engineer succumbs a month before retirement||SURAT: An executive engineer of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC), Hitendra Suthar (58), died following Covid-19 infection at a private hospital in Surat on Tuesday. At least 27 employees of the civic body have become a victim of coronavirus since the beginning of the pandemic last year. Four of the recent deaths were recorded in the last 15-20 days. According to SMC, Suthar had just one month left for retirement. “Suthar was actively engaged in the fight against the pandemic since the beginning. When SMC created Covid-19 hospital at SMIMER Hospital, Suthar was looking after the housing department then,” a close colleague of the deceased engineer said. “Suthar was first admitted into SMIMER hospital but his oxygen level dropped drastically and was shifted to a private hospital. He was later put on ventilator support and on Tuesday he breathed his last,” he added. Earlier, in the first week of April, an SMC sanitary inspector Mohammad Hanif had succumbed to the Covid-19 infection. Of the 27 SMC staffers who have died of Covid-19 at least half are from the health department. The deceased SMC employees include two sanitary sub-inspectors, four sanitary inspectors, two sanitation workers, seven clerks, four beldars, a junior engineer, a sub-officer (fire), a peon and an assistant accountant. Of the nearly 22,000 employees of SMC, at least 1,500 have tested positive for the coronavirus so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/smc-engineer-succumbs-a-month-before-retirement/articleshow/82055038.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh Covid count close to 9,000, Gwalior under lockdown||Bhopal: In the steepest and scariest Covid surge in Madhya Pradesh, the state’s daily count shot up close to 9,000 on Tuesday — a jump of nearly 40% in just 24 hours. Tuesday’s tally was 8,998, at a positivity rate of 19.3% — both all-time highs of the pandemic. On Monday, 6,489 cases had been detected at a positivity of 16.9, which was a shocker anyway. As many as 4,888 active cases have been added in the past 24 hours, taking MP’s active count to 43,539. What added to the concern were the 40 deaths reported on Tuesday, taking MP’s Covid toll to 4,261. Over 46% of MP’s active cases are in Indore, Bhopal, Jabalpur and Gwalior. The active count has shot up by 67% in the past week alone, and 175 people died during this period. Gwalior, where active cases have rocketed from 1,104 to 2,939 in just seven days — a rise of 166% — will go into a week’s ‘Corona curfew’ from 6am on Thursday. The decision was taken by the district crisis management group. There will be relaxation for milk and vegetable sales till 9am. Medicine shops, fuel pumps and fair price shops are exempted from the restrictions, and government offices concerned with providing essential services will also remain open. Tuesday was the eighth consecutive day when more than 4,000 new Covid infections were reported in Madhya Pradesh, and the 12th consecutive day of a new high every day. The positivity rate has increased by more than 100% in the past 12 days. In Chhindwara, hospitals are struggling to keep pace with the Covid surge. With most hospitals full, some patients had to be kept on the floor, especially as they waited to be shifted to their bed after admission. Sources said that a few patients were given oxygen while they lay on the floor on Thursday. Civil surgeon Dr CS Gogiya said, “The patient count has definitely increased. When new patients come, we first examine them outside the wards. In the meanti me, their beds are prepared and then they are shifted. When 4-5 patients arrived at the same time for admission, they had to be kept outside, perhaps for a short time on the floor, until their beds were prepared.” It is during this transition time that a patient may have had to be administered oxygen while she lay on the floor, she said.

---||Goa||With 35 nests, Agonda sees best turtle nesting season||POINGUINIM: The Agonda turtle nursery has great reason to cheer. With 35 Olive Ridley turtles visiting the beach to lay their eggs, this has been the centre’s best season. Its earlier high, 19 turtle nests, was in 2017-18. The first turtle nest this year was preserved on January 7 and the last pit on March 20. Range forest officer (RFO) Anant Velip said that in all, this season 4,002 turtle eggs from 35 nests have been protected at Agonda. Ten of these pits have hatched already and wildlife authorities has have released as many as 1,071 hatchlings into the sea. For the villagers of Agonda, many of whom make their living via the business of shacks, tents and huts, this is almost a vindication of sorts. While government authorities have often said that lights and noise are a hindrance to the nesting process, they in fact feel the turtles are attracted to the music and the lights.  Challenging the authorities to prove their claim, they said that this increasing number of flippered visitors is proof that turtles are least disturbed to either of these factors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-35-nests-agonda-sees-best-turtle-nesting-season/articleshow/82056441.cms||---
---||Delhi||Are religious gathering curbs enforced for all: Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court on Tuesday asked the Centre to file an affidavit clarifying that the recent Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) order banning all types of religious gatherings is being enforced across the board, after it opp-osed permitting more than 20 people to enter the Nizamuddin Markaz mosque during Ramzan. "Are all religious places having limited numbers? Is it being enforced? You file an affidavit that no religious congregations are being permitted," Justice Mukta Gupta said, asking the Centre to indicate the manner in which the prohibitory orders of the DDMA issued on April 10 was being followed. EC: Acting without notice to Sinha due to urgency of matterThe EC, in its notice to Dilip Ghosh, said it was of the view that he had, in violation of the model code of conduct, Section 123 (3A) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, and Section 153A of the IPC (the latter two dealing with promoting communal hatred) “made statements that are provocative and can seriously incite the emotions and lead to breakdown of law and order, thereby adversely affecting the election process”. The EC gave him time until 10 am on Wednesday to explain. While addressing a public rally in Barangar, North 24 Parganas on April 11, Ghosh had said, “Where did so many naughty boys come from? Those naughty boys were shot at yesterday in Sitalkuchi. These naughty boys will not be there in Bengal. Those who thought that the central forces' rifles were meant to be just for show have well understood now the power of cartridges. And this will be carried on throughout Bengal. Those who take the law in their own hands will be given a befitting answer. I hope that you all will queue up to cast your votes on the morning on April 17. Central forces will be there in the booths. No one can show you an angry eye. Because we are here. And if someone crosses his limits, then you have seen what happened in Sitalkuchi. There will be Sitalkuchi in several places.” Trinamool Congress had complained to the EC against Ghosh’s “inflammatory” statement, saying it was an “open threat to Bengal and its people”. Strongly condemning Rahul Sinha’s statement during a speech on April 12, the EC barred him from campaigning in any manner from 12 noon on Tuesday to 12 noon on Thursday. He had said, “The central forces have given them a befitting answer. The central forces should have killed eight people instead of four in Sitalkuchi. The central forces should be issued a show cause notice as to why they have killed only four of them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/are-religious-gathering-curbs-enforced-for-all-delhi-hc/articleshow/82058294.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Indore||Indore: Covid deaths in 41-60 group rise 12%||INDORE: More Covid patients in the age group of 41to 60 have died in Indore district in the past three weeks. Records with the Chief Medical and Health officer show a 12% jump in deaths in the 41-60 group and 1% rise in the 21-40 group. The share of deaths in the 41-60 category rose to 46.3% between March 23 and April 11. This was 34% in the first year of the pandemic. Dr Salil Bhargava, HoD respiratory medicine, said, “The second wave is proving to be more dangerous than the earlier one with more youngsters getting infected.” “Severity in these young patients may be rising due to an unknown behaviour of new strains of Covid-19 reported in the district,” added Dr Bhargava. ‘Younger people seem to be more casual with Covid-19 norms’ It seems, the young are also very causal in following Covid precautions,” added Dr Bhargava. Since more elderly people died in the initial peaks of the outbreak, most of this vulnerable group are now remaining inside their houses and limiting their exposure, he pointed out. This helped in containing infections and deaths in the 60-plus group, Dr Bhargava said. Hospitalization records with CMHO showed that more than two-thirds of those hospitalised were 21-60 years of age, most of them between 21years and 40 years as they need to go out the most. This phenomenon was reported since the beginning of the ‘second wave’, from February 15. Till March 31, 6,083 of the 8,832 hospitalised were in the 21-60 age group. Half of them were in 21-40 group. The records also suggest that the share of deaths in 61-80 age group dropped 7% in the period.

---||India||E-courts may let cases be filed 24/7 from anywhere||NEW DELHI: Limiting the registry’s role in prioritising cases, Phase 3 of the e-Courts project, currently in the draft stage, has proposed a 24/7 digital window to litigants and lawyers to file cases from anywhere, anytime with the provision of scheduling digital hearings in an open court, ensuring compliance of timelines by both judges and litigants. Use of artificial intelligence has been proposed to “intelligently recommend schedules for hearing by optimising and coordinating the schedules and time of different actors (judges, lawyers and litigants)”, the draft proposal put up on the website of the justice department seeking stakeholders’ suggestions said. The Centre’s ambitious e-Courts project, initiated in 2005, has completed two phases so far. At a cost of Rs 2,300 crore, it has computerised almost all 19,000 functional district and subordinate courts with broadband connectivity and equipped judges and courtrooms with modern communication gadgets. The Supreme Court e-Committee is responsible for policy planning and strategic direction. The next phase of judicial reforms envisages a complete transformation of Indian courts into digital platforms — having facilities of e-Pay, e-Summons, e-Hearings and e-Judgment — where litigants can appear remotely, schedule hearings at his/her convenience and an option of choosing alternative dispute resolution mechanism or a regular case while e-Filing. It has proposed an interoperable criminal justice system where connectivity between courts, prison and police will be leveraged to ensure speedy trial of cases and limiting adjournments on account of non-appearance of witnesses or unavailability of lawyers. The digital court will provide for a data exchange protocol embedded with a privacy policy. During the second phase of the e-Courts project, more than 3,400 courts were made videoconference compatible, providing connectivity with prisons. These facilities are already available in the Supreme Court and high courts. Phase 3 also proposes to enable transcription of court proceedings from audio/video format to typed digital record that can be made available to litigants and lawyers after the end of hearings. “Live streaming or sharing recorded court proceedings can enable courts to become more open,” the draft proposal said. The court registry will be converted into a digital case registry where each case will be given a unique number that will help in locating the case as it moves from one level to another, without the need of refiling of documents in case of appeal in higher courts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/e-courts-may-let-cases-be-filed-24/7-from-anywhere/articleshow/82058305.cms||Pradeep Thakur
---||Nagpur||Nagpur mourns passing away of Vira Sathidar||Nagpur: Thinker, writer and actor Vira Sathidar passed away on Monday night while under treatment for Covid-19 at AIIMS Nagpur. He was 62. His role in the National Film Award winning film ‘Court’ was a hit. The film was also nominated for an Oscar. Vira, as he was known, was infected with Covid-19 a few days ago and was admitted to AIIMS Nagpur a week ago. He had developed Covid pneumonia. The last rites were performed on Tuesday afternoon. He leaves behind wife, son and relatives to mourn the loss. For the Ambedkarite movement and people’s theatre in Nagpur and Vidarbha, Vira was much more than just a movie artist. He was a poet, lyricist, literary activist, human rights activist, writer, journalist, teacher and much more. He was actively associated with Dalit Panthers, the anti-caste movement. Shocked to hear about Sathidar’s sad demise, ‘Court’ director Chaitanya Tamhane told PTI. “I am speechless right now. I fondly recall the time we discovered him and took him on board as the lead actor for my debut directorial. He was one of the nicest human beings I met. We have lost a talented soul,” he said. Vira was born as Vijay Vairagade in Parsodi village near Butibori to a father who used to work as a porter at Nagpur railway station, while his mother was a construction labourer. His parents were also associated with the Ambedkarite movement and they insisted he pursue an education. During his early days, he worked as a labourer in many factories in MIDC Nagpur. This was the period when he first came under the impression of Leftist ideology. He also worked as a journalist for a local Marathi newspaper. Later, he edited ‘Vidrohi’, a Marathi magazine. Vira left the caste-expressing surname and took ‘Sathidar’ (comrade) as his second name, inspired by the Leftist movement. He used to write poems, songs, and literature with the same name. His songs were quite popular in ‘Ambedkari Jalsa’, a literary musical event in street play format, which is quite popular in Maharashtra. Ambedkarite activist Nihalsingh Rathod, Mukund Adevar, Dinanath Waghmare, Republican Movement’s Naresh Wahane, Prakash Kumbhe from RPI, Rajan Waghmare from RPI-A, and many other organizations paid tributes to Vira throughout the day. “We have lost a fatherly figure today,” said Rathod. “He was just in his sixties and will be missed badly. The news of his death, just a day before Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar’s birth anniversary, is more painful,” he added. Theatre activist Virendra Ganvir, who was quite close to Sathidar, said, “He was like a Guru for many artists like us.” Communist leader Raju Desale said Vira’s style of working and energy was like a youth. “He participated in every movement for the enlightenment of society. Vira Sathidar was an important link in our movement. This is an irreparable loss for the Communist Party of India,” said Desale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nagpur-mourns-passing-away-of-vira-sathidar/articleshow/82055773.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The Coast Guard deployed three ships and aircraft for the rescue operations. Many local fishing boats have also joined the search. Jaffar said that seven of the 14 fishermen hailed from TN and the rest from Bengal.

Rao has been Bankura SP since mid-2019. CBI sources said Rao’s statement was recorded. At the agency’s Nizam Palace office, the officer was asked about steps he took to tackle the coal mining scam and also about illegal sand mining. On Tuesday, CBI interrogated Anup Majee, alias Lala, for the seventh time. The Supreme Court had issued a directive not to arrest Majee until April 13; the matter is likely to be heard again by SC on Wednesday. CBI sources hinted they would appeal for taking Majee into custody on Wednesday as he was an influential person in the coal mining case. Both CBI and ED are probing the coal mining scam that involved siphoning off of over Rs 1,300 crore, which, sources hinted, had reached people in the power corridors. Several other IPS officers too had been questioned in the case. Bengal CID had formed an SIT to investigate the scam and conducted raids in Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand. The agencies had been visiting the Asansol-Raniganj coal belt to trace the illegal coal mining and coal theft from some collieries in West Burdwan.. A week ago, ED had arrested Bankura IC Ashok Mishra from Delhi. ED sources said he had been arrested as a facilitator in the coal mining scam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cbi-records-bankura-sps-statement-in-coal-mining-case/articleshow/82056529.cms||Rohit Khanna

---||Kolkata||As Covid-19 cases surge among kids, Kolkata doctors seek separate treatment protocol||KOLKATA: As Covid numbers balloon in the state, paediatricians in the city are suddenly being flooded with calls from distraught parents seeking advice for their children who have tested positive. While the first wave of the pandemic had largely spared kids, the infection is multiplying fast among children in the second wave, say doctors. Even though most of the kids are mildly symptomatic, what has experts worried is the lack of a treatment protocol for children. The Medical College Hospital is the only hospital in the state with a dedicated Covid facility for kids and it is mulling increasing the number of beds as it expects referrals from other hospitals to pour in soon. “We came across the first positive case among children this year on March 30 and we have already treated 17 children within two weeks. During the first wave, it took about three to four months for the number to reach 17,” said Dibyendu Raychaudhuri, assistant professor of paediatrics at Medical College. In the past few days, paediatric intensivist Prabhas Prasun Giri has consulted at least 30 positive children aged between three months and 15 years. “Due to the increased infection rate the chances of encountering more kids with moderate to severe infection are higher in the near future. There is an urgent need to ramp up Covid treatment facility for children,” said Giri, an associate professor at Institute of Child Health. According to the doctors, during the first wave children mostly remained asymptomatic. But this time they are exhibiting symptoms like diarrhoea and vomiting. “Children are coming mostly with complaints like diarrhoea and vomiting and they are so far recovering quickly. But given the kind of escalation in numbers, we might get sicker patients in future,” said Soumen Meur, paediatric intensivist at AMRI Hospitals, Mukundapur. Public health expert at Swasthya Bhawan, Anirban Dalui, feels changes in the virus could also be contributing to the higher infectivity among children now. “Besides, during the first wave, people were more conscious and parents were working from home. Now they are going out to work, mostly disregarding Covid-appropriate behaviour and bringing the virus back home,” said Dalui. “Given the increase in positive cases, who are so far mostly mildly symptomatic, we might start getting an increased number of MIS-C (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children), a secondary post-Covid symptom in about a month’s time,” warned paediatrician Sumita Saha of Fortis Hospital. Alarmed at the developing situation, Protect The Warriors (PTW), a doctors’ body, has written to health secretary Narayan Swaroop Nigam to issue a separate Covid management protocol for children. “Many paediatricians who are part of PTW are getting an increased number of infected children that too with atypical symptoms. They feel the need for a separate treatment and management guideline for children as the previous guideline was meant for adult patients,” said PTW general secretary Abhik Ghosh, ENT and head and neck surgeon at Apollo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/as-cases-surge-among-kids-docs-seek-separate-treatment-protocol/articleshow/82056963.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Surat||Surat: Unaware of change, kin brave heat for remdesivir injections||SURAT: “Both my parents are in the ICU and I urgently need remdesivir injections. My brother is waiting outside Kiran Hospital while I am waiting here since early in the morning, But there is no clarity about the procedure,” said Nilesh Solanki, a harassed resident of Navagam Dindoli area who has been queuing up in the scorching heat for hours at New Civil Hospital (NCH) to get the life saving drugs. Solanki is not alone as many others too aren’t aware of the new system devised by the district administration of supplying remdesivir injections to private hospitals. Under the new system announced on Monday morning, private hospitals are supposed to send authorized persons to the NCH with all documents of the patients needing the life-saving drug. However, on Tuesday too relatives of patients were seen outside the out-patient department (OPD) at NCH — most being unaware of the change in system and many others standing in the queue as the hospitals did not have adequate staff to do so. Srujna Prajapati, who suffers from high blood pressure, too returned on Tuesday after two days with a neighbour to get hold of the vials for her ailing husband. “The hospital said that they do not have enough people to wait here so I am here in queue. I cannot wait under the sun for long and had to return yesterday after waiting for long hours,” Prajapati said. Another relative of a patient had to return empty handed as the name written on the prescription did not that of the patient’s aadhaar card. “After waiting for hours, we have to return like this. The administration should understand our condition too as after rejecting our request they are not even accepting the photo of fresh prescription sent by the doctor on WhatsApp,” said Satish Mansukhbhai, whose nephew is admitted at a private hospital in Adajan. The district administration had received 3,000 injections for private hospitals in Surat city on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/unaware-of-change-kin-brave-heat-for-remdesivir-injections/articleshow/82055048.cms||---
---||Kolkata||They stopped me from campaigning, you decide how fair it is: West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee||KOLKATA: Chief minister and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, breaking a 24-hour ban on campaigning imposed by the Election Commission, said she left it to the people to decide how fair it was that she could not campaign for her party during that time, even as BJP leaders were free to do so. “What wrong did Mamata Banerjee say? Vote in a united way. I still want people to vote in a united way,” she told the crowd at Barasat, 15 minutes after the ban ended. The public rally, and a subsequent one at Salt Lake, capped a day of dharna — three-and-a-half hours long, which she sat on, alone — at the foot of the Mahatma Gandhi statue at the Mayo Road crossing in protest against the EC’s ban. There were no party colleagues, supporters or even her guards by her side as she stayed seated on her wheelchair on the road, finished as many as 15 oil paintings and answered a few phone calls. She stayed there between 11.25am and 3.02pm without making a single public utterance. In Barasat, the CM alluded to statements made by her during campaigning in Hooghly’s Tarakeswar on April 4, where she had appealed to her “minority brothers and sisters with folded hands... do not let minority votes be divided.” The unprecedented EC ban had come after that statement, and a subsequent one urging people, especially women, to “gherao CRPF personnel if they foment trouble”, made two days later in Cooch Behar. “I am a street fighter, and I fight the battle from the battlefield,” Banerjee said, reminding everyone that she couldn’t be confined to her home. Arguing that the 72-hour silence phase for the phase-V polls on Saturday (for all political parties) and the 24-hour ban meant she could not campaign for “four days”, she alleged that there was a concerted, all-out effort to stop her, under the “pretext” of an election. “From the heavyweights to the minnows in BJP across the country, the government of India, all its agencies are (working) together to finish me. There is an unholy effort to insult Bengal, to capture Bengal. But I will never let Bengal be Gujarat,” she said. “They cannot defeat me,” she added, “although they will cause more trouble for me” in the remaining four phases. Attacking PM Narendra Modi, she said: “Every election day, he will launch a campaign (in Bengal). He is the Prime Minister, not just any politician. People can be misled. I want to draw the EC’s attention to it. If he stops, I will also not campaign.” Accusing the PM of “lying” that she had done nothing for the Matuas, she offered to “quit politics if he can prove a word he said. If not, he should hold his ears and perform squats. I will, too, if I am proved wrong.” Accusing Union home minister Amit Shah of “photoshopping” his door-to-door campaigns, dismissing it, saying “Children do photoshop.” She also said Shah was misleading people on NRC. Earlier, in the day, at the dharna venue, even as she didn’t make a single public utterance, there was no shortage of an audience, as people and party workers gathered in large numbers just to watch her from a distance. There were also a host of senior Trinamool functionaries — Subrata Bakshi, Subrata Mukherjee, Kalyan Banerjee, Sovandeb Chattopadhyay and others, who reached Mayo Road but sat on the other side of the crossing, away from the dharna venue. Even as most leaders chose to stay mum, the party’s cultural cell members, such as Kabir Suman, Soumitra Ray, Haranath Chakraborty and Bharat Kaul sported banners saying “Black day for Democracy” and “Shame Shame”, raising their voice against the EC. “What has happened is the death of democracy, which is why we are here to protest,” said musician Ray. Similar scenes unfolded at the Barasat rally venue, the Vidyasagar Krirangan ground. The police had to restrict the crowd as the ground was already full by 7.30pm. There was a thunderous applause as Banerjee entered the stage around 8.15pm, with Barasat MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar and Barasat MLA and candidate Chiranjeet welcoming the CM on stage. Later, in Salt Lake, giant screens were placed around the BF ground for the benefit of those who could not enter the ground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/they-stopped-me-from-campaigning-you-decide-how-fair-it-is-mamata/articleshow/82056954.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Ranchi||JMM stalwart Simon Marandi dies at 74||RANCHI: JMM stalwart Simon Marandi (74) died late on Monday night at a private hospital in Kolkata. He was one of the founding members of the JMM. Chief minister Hemant Soren, Jharkhand Assembly speaker Rabindranath Mahto, state Congress chief Rameshwar Oraon, Congress legislative party leader Alamgir Alam, health minister Banna Gupta, among others, expressed their grief at Simon’s passing. “He contributed to the separate statehood movement. He will be sorely missed,” Hemant said in a tweet. Simon, who was JMM’s central vice president, was admitted to Kolkata’s R N Tagore Hospital on March 14 to undergo treatment for a cardiac ailment. He died around 11:45pm on Monday. He was suffering from multiple ailments and was medically critical, JMM sources said. Simon’s elder son Dinesh William Marandi, who is the incumbent MLA from Littipara constituency in Pakur, did not respond when contacted. But the family’s close associates said Simon’s mortal remains reached his home in Pakur’s Hiranpur on Tuesday by road from Kolkata. “Simon Da will be laid to rest at his ancestral village, Dumariya, in Littipara block on Wednesday morning,” an associate said over the phone. It was, however, not known whether Hemant will attend Simon’s last rites on Wednesday. Hemant has been camping in Madhupur to canvas for JMM candidate Hafizul Hassan since April 9 and is expected to return to Ranchi on Wednesday evening. Simon cut his teeth into student politics at an early age in the then undivided Bihar. In 1977, Simon became an MLA for the first time after defeating the then incumbent lawmaker Marang Murmu by 149 votes. He went on to win the seat in 1980, 1985, 2009 and 2017. He was also the state rural development minister in Hemant’s cabinet from 2013 to 2014. He was elected to the Lok Sabha from Rajmahal (ST) constituency in 1989 and 1991. In 2014, he switched to BJP and contested in Littipara on a BJP ticket. Three years later, when Littipara went to vote after the death of its incumbent MLA Dr Anil Murmu, Simon returned to the JMM fold and was handed the ticket. He went on to win. However, he did not contest the polls in 2019 due to ill health and JMM fielded his son.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jmm-stalwart-simon-marandi-dies-at-74/articleshow/82055317.cms||Dhritiman Ray

On Tuesday, BJP and Trinamool Congress supporters clashed at Rashikpur crossing in South Burdwan assembly constituency where state BJP president Dilip Ghosh was holding a roadshow for party candidate Sanjay Nandi. Suspected BJP supporters vandalised the Trinamool office at Rashikpur after some BJP flexes mounted on totos were torn by Trinamool backers. Later, Trinamool supporters blocked the crossing in protest. Ghosh’s roadshow, which began from Power House and was scheduled to end at Parkas Road, went smoothly until Rashikpur crossing. Trinamool supporters claimed abuses were hurled at them from the roadshow at this point. Police sources said chants were raised by both sides. While Trinamool supporters shouted “Jai Bangla”, BJP backers chanted “Jai Shri Ram”. Some youths then tore the flexes on the totos. A little later, a group of suspected BJP supporters armed with flagposts attacked the Trinamool office and vandalised furniture, flexes and party flags. Ghosh said: “Miscreants have got a shot in the arm during Trinamool regime. We want to tell voters of Burdwan that they (goons) can do nothing on polling day. Central forces have done a commendable job to ensure peace during election.” Trinamool leader from Burdwan, Swapan Debnath, said: “Dilip Ghosh always creates provocation. So on his way, he did the same to provoke his supporters to ransack the TMC office. It is not unexpected of him.” In North 24 Parganas’ Garulia, under Jagaddal police station limits, bombs were hurled at a BJP supporter’s house early on Tuesday. The apartment at Bharat Housing, belonging to local businessman Gourango Das, was attacked by suspected Trinamool goons. Gourango’s son Nilratan said three miscreants on a bike hurled three crude bombs near their flat, shattering window panes. “When he (Gourango) stepped out, they fled. My father is a BJP supporter. Trinamool goons were targeting our house to intimidate him,” Nilratan alleged. In Haria police station limits, six crude bombs were recovered during a combing operation by police and central armed forces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-office-targeted-in-south-burdwan-after-bjp-flexes-torn/articleshow/82056460.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Shah promises ST status to Gorkha sub-castes, Hills political solution||Darjeeling/Nagrakata/Bidhannagar: Union home minister Amit Shah promised Gorkhas in the Hills that ST status would be granted to 11 sub-castes once BJP assumed office in Bengal. The “double engine” government (in Bengal and at the Centre) would work for a “permanent political solution” in the Hills, he announced and allayed Gorkhas’ fears of a National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise, saying it would not affect them. “Eleven leftover Gorkha sub-castes want Scheduled Tribe status. The matter has been pending for years. The BJP government wanted to resolve this, but Mamata Ji did not attend any meeting on this issue. Change Mamata Didi and bring a BJP chief minister, the party will provide Scheduled Tribe status to 11 sub-castes of Gorkha community,” the Union minister said in Darjeeling on Tuesday. The sub-castes include Gurung, Bhujel, Mangar, Newar, Jogi, Khas, Rai, Sunwar, Thami, Yakkha and Dhimal. Shah’s announcement is meant to take the wind out of Gorkha leader Bimal Gurung’s sails and targets four to five seats in the foothills with Gorkha presence. “The ties between Gorkhas and BJP were made in heaven,” he said, showering promises to develop Darjeeling as an educational hub and set up a mega pharma park there, and give a three-year tax waiver to Hills tourism and the hospitality sector. “You will also turn the state’s oldest civic body, Darjeeling Municipality, into a municipal corporation,” he added. In an attempt to woo voters in the Hills, which is set for a multi-pronged contest, Shah said a BJP government would start the process of dropping all cases the state government had slapped on Hills people during the Gorkhaland stir since the late 1980s and in 2017. “Communists set the Hills on fire in 1986-88. Many died during the Trinamool regime too. We will withdraw all pending cases after May 2,” he said. The announcement is likely to have traction even among Bimal Gurung’s supporters. Later in the evening, addressing an election meeting at Bidyanagar under Bidhannagar assembly constituency, the Union minister said infrastructure in Kolkata and its surroundings would get a Rs 22,000 crore boost. Shah iterated BJP’s commitment to grant citizenship to refugees, including Matuas and namasudras. “We will also set up Uttarbanga Vikas Parishad for the development of north Bengal,” he announced among other promises such as setting up an AIIMS, a central university, and an IT park and Metro connectivity in Siliguri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/shah-promises-st-status-to-gorkha-sub-castes-hills-political-solution/articleshow/82056535.cms||Deep Gazmer
---||Kolkata||Rajnath to Didi: Why blame the PM for everything?||Swarupnagar (North 24 Parganas): Defence minister and BJP senior Rajnath Singh on Tuesday hit out at Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, saying her conduct was “unbecoming” of a CM. Singh referred to election strategist Prashant Kishor’s chat claiming that Trinamool Congress was on its way out and that the BJP was coming in. “You talk nonsense about our PM. Why do you blame him for everything? I have also been a chief minister. I know how a CM should behave. Perhaps Mamata Banerjee has accepted that she is going to lose. It is evident from her desperation and the language she is using against her political opponents,” the defence minister said at a BJP gathering at Swarupnagar in North 24 Parganas. Singh took a dig at the Bengal CM while she sat on a dharna in front at Mayo Road following the Election Commission banning her campaign for 24 hours for violating the Model Code of Conduct. The EC also banned BJP leader Rahul Sinha’s campaign for 48 hours, cautioned BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari and served a show-cause notice on Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh. The defence minister took exception to Banerjee’s stance following the EC ban. “The EC has banned her for 24 hours citing the Model Code of Conduct violation. She’s now against the EC. Didi, can you spare anyone?” he asked. Singh rubbished the TMC version that law and order was now being looked after by the Election Commission as the entire state administration was placed under the poll panel. “If law and order in any state deteriorates, the CM has to take responsibility. Bengal has witnessed unprecedented crime and violence during Mamata Banerjee’s regime. As many as 150-200 BJP workers were killed. Our workers were killed in daylight and their bodies hung from poles,” he added. Without naming Trinamool MP Mahua Moitra and her tweet that Banerjee would be contesting from Varanasi in the coming Lok Sabha polls, he said: “Mamata Banerjee says she will contest from Varanasi. I want to tell her that she should surely visit Varanasi once and take the blessings of Baba Vishwanath.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rajnath-to-didi-why-blame-the-pm-for-everything/articleshow/82056618.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

Addressing a rally on Tuesday, he said: “Rajiv Gandhi opened the locks of Babri Masjid in 1985, resulting in a bloodbath later. The Congress paved the way for the BJP.” Calling Congress a friend of BJP, Owaisi said: “Else, how could the Congress lend its support to Shiv Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister of Maharashtra?” “PM Modi has weakened the basic thread of our country — unity in diversity,” Owaisi said. AIMIM has fielded three candidates in Murshidabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/owaisi-lashes-out-at-cong-and-modi/articleshow/82056481.cms||Sukumar Mahato

The man, in his late sixties and identified as Pawan Kumar Gupta, allegedly breathed his last on a stretcher at the lobby of the hospital. It was around the same time when health minister Banna Gupta had paid a surprise visit to the hospital and had walked into the Covid-19 ward wearing a PPE kit in presence of media personnel. It was not known whether the deceased was a Covid-19 patient till Tuesday evening. In tears, the deceased’s daughter wailed at the lobby while her lifeless father lay on the stretcher. She blamed the death on the system and the minister. “We were at the hospital since morning. But no one stepped forward to help us and admit my father. Some said there are no beds available, others said paperwork needs to be done before admission. We kept pleading, but doctors did not come and attend my father,” the daughter said. As per health department’s data, Ranchi sadar hospital had 240 Covid-19 beds of which 60 are ventilator supported. Ranchi civil surgeon Dr V B Prasad did not answer calls when contacted to enquire about the availability of beds. The patient’s kin confronted Gupta when he emerged out of the Covid-19 ward. “What will you do now? Will you bring back my father? You only come to seek votes,” the daughter screamed at Gupta. Left red-faced, Gupta called the incident unfortunate. “Any death is unfortunate. When I learnt about the circumstances in which her father died, it shattered me,” the minister told reporters. In the evening, Gupta’s office issued a statement claiming that Ranchi civil surgeon has been directed to initiate an inquiry into the alleged negligence and act tough against those who are found guilty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/banna-inspects-sadar-hosp-a-patient-dies-at-its-doorsteps/articleshow/82055310.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||Black Tuesday: 29 Cov deaths, 2844 new cases||RANCHI: With 29 Covid fatalities and 2,844 new infections, Tuesday was the grimmest day of the pandemic in Jharkhand so far. While the number of casualties is the highest so far, the number of new cases is second after August 31 mass testing drive when 1.67 lakh people were tested in a single day, throwing up 3,331 positive results. In comparison, fewer than 35,000 tests were conducted on Tuesday with a positivity rate of 8.33%. The state’s seven-day rolling average of daily new cases touched an all-time high of 2,143 cases. With 48 deaths in in the last 48 hours, the two-day-toll in the state passed the 41 casualties recorded in the whole of February and March put together. The rush at the Ranchi’s crematorium continued as the lone incinerator at Mukti Dham was still not fixed and bodies of Covid patients laid in ambulances outside for more than 24 hours since Monday evening. Among the districts, Ranchi recorded 1,049, second time the figure has been above the 1,000-mark. Districts with three-digit spikes included East Singhbhum (434 cases), Hazaribag (204) and Dhanbad (117) while the others reported double digit growth, indicating that the spread of virus isn’t just restricted to urban pockets unlike the situation during the first wave. In terms of fatalities, Ranchi and East Singhbhum witnessed six deaths each followed by four in Hazaribag, three each in Ramgarh and Simdega, two in Bokaro and one each in Godda, Khunti, Jamtara and West Singhbhum. In Jamshedpur (East Singhbhum), a former HoD of pediatric of MGM hospital, Birendra Prasad, died of COVID at TMH in the morning, making it as the first casualty of a doctor here this year, said the Jamshedpur chapter of IMA. Remarking on the grim situation, another official of IMA remarked, “The trend now is people have started to die both in rural and urban areas in the state as the infection rate deepens. This will be a reason for concern as more infections in rural areas will drive people to urban centres for treatment, leading to rush, chaos and casualties.” In terms of vaccination, 22,05,532 people got their first doses till Tuesday whereas 3,12,400 received their second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/black-tuesday-29-cov-deaths-2844-new-cases/articleshow/82055305.cms||---

These areas include certain apartments, Ward 27 of the Dhanbad Municipal Corporation (DMC), Saraidhela, Pathak Colony, Surya Realcon and Manaitand. Fourteen persons have tested positive in Surya Realcon alone. Notably, a team of doctors and paramedics faced opposition from residents when they went there on Tuesday to conduct mass testing. Dhanbad SDO Surendra Kumar said a total of 143 families are living in the colony and the administration has decided to test them all to curb the spread of the virus. He warned the residents that if they do not allow the health team to conduct the tests, the administration will have no option but to seal the colony and make them undergo the test. Similar protests were reported from other areas of the district, too. “The administration has decided to continue intensive testing campaign on Wednesday in Matkuria, Wasseypur, Vanasthali Colony and Telipara areas. The district administration is committed to fulfil the goal of track, test and treat to ensure proper management of the coronavirus infection,” the DC added. Meanwhile, the district administration has asked all government officials and employees not to leave the headquarters without prior permission keeping in view the increasing cases of Covid-19 in the district.

---||Ranchi||State govt secretaries are statues, they only listen and not act: HC||Ranchi: Lashing out for the lackadaisical approach of bureaucrats in the state, the Jharkhand high court on Tuesday said secretaries of the state government are mere “statues” and the officers “only listen and not act”. A division bench of Chief Justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad was hearing a PIL on the poor condition of facilities at the state’s only tertiary care centre for Covid-19 — Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) — and the rise in the number of fresh cases of the virus in the state. The court also observed that merely filing affidavits before judges will not resolve the situation. “The doctors at Rims are very qualified, but with no equipment and infrastructure, they are not able to perform their duties as expected. The government has not done anything for the past one year to improve the system,” the court said and said the case will be heard again on April 18. “If things are not taken seriously, people will revolt,” the bench cautioned the advocate general in course of the hearing conducted through video conferencing. The bench further said, “Government secretaries and officers seem to think that the court is requesting them to comply with our orders. This is not the case.” Ranchi deputy commissioner, civil surgeon, and Rims director were present online in the hearing. Advocate general Rajiv Ranjan informed the court that facilities have been increased at the sadar hospital and 300 beds with oxygen support have been commissioned. He also informed that the procedure to purchase a CT scan machine at Rims has also been initiated. The bench said the government ought to learn from the past. “The Spanish Flu had claimed many lives. The government has to beef up its system to fight the medical emergency,” the court observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-govt-secretaries-are-statues-they-only-listen-and-not-act-hc/articleshow/82055254.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Mukti Dham’s gas-powered cremation machine to be fixed by Thursday: RMC||Ranchi: The gas-powered machine at Ranchi’s Mukti Dham crematorium is likely to be up and running by Thursday, officials at Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC) said on Tuesday. “We have got in touch with the manufacturer of the machine in New Delhi and are in the process to procure a new set of burners which is expected to arrive by tomorrow (Wednesday). We are hopeful that the machine will be operational in the next 48 hours,” Ranchi municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar told TOI. Managed by Ranchi-based Marwari Sahayak Sangh, the machine uses three LPG-powered burners and was installed in 2017 after overhauling Mukti Dham’s electric pyre. The machine had developed a snag on the morning of April 11, leading to long queues of corpses of deceased Covid-19 patients. At night, the administration set up an alternate conventional cremation arrangement by the banks of Swarnarekha River in Ghagra on the fringes of the city. Kumar said the delay in fixing the machine was caused by electrical failure in its wiring system and the burners going out of order. “We fixed the wiring and started it on Monday afternoon, but after running for 15 minutes, it went out of order again. The same thing happened today (Tuesday),” Kumar said. The LPG-powered machine had come handy in cremating Covid patients at a time when the number of deaths is rising in the city. On April 10, 16 corpses were cremated in it. The administration said it will continue to cremate corpses of Covid-19 patients at Ghagra till the machine is fixed. “As many 28 corpses were cremated till Tuesday afternoon. Many more will be cremated by following the laid out protocols,” Bundu sub-divisional officer Utkarsh Gupta said. Gupta, Kumar and Ranchi deputy commissioner Chhavi Ranjan were present at Ghagra in the early hours on Tuesday. Meanwhile, health secretary Kamal Kishore Soan directed the deputy commissioners of all the 24 districts to ensure unhindered cremation of deceased Covid-19 patients. Soan also asked the districts to appoint officials to oversee cremations and report it to the administration. “The kin of deceased Covid-19 patients should not face any difficulties in cremating the dead,” the order read.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/mukti-dhams-gas-powered-cremation-machine-to-be-fixed-by-thursday-rmc/articleshow/82055285.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Kolkata||Mamata to meet families of Sitalkuchi firing victims today||Kolkata: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee is expected to reach Mathabhanga subdivisional hospital on Wednesday to speak to the bereaved families and to those injured in the Sitalkuchi firing during fourth-phase polling on April 10. Banerjee had said she would go to Sitalkuchi immediately after the Election Commission’s 72-hour ban on political leaders entering Cooch Behar ended. Earlier, in a video call from Siliguri, she had spoken to families of two of those who had died. Banerjee strongly refuted BJP’s claim that she spoke for only four deaths in CISF firing but remained silent on the death of a Rajbonshi teenager the same day. The CM said: “Who said I didn’t speak (on the other death)? I had publicly offered my homage and a plaque bore the names of all the dead.” She said she had wanted to meet Ananda Burman’s family too (on Wednesday). “What can I do if they don’t come (to meet me)? I will help all. I want to help all. My political battle is with the party. Not with its workers. To me everyone is dear. Everyone is equal to me,” Banerjee said. Blaming BJP for the Rajbanshi teenager’s death, the CM said: “He was killed by anti-socials. We have reasons to suspect that BJP has killed him. The burden to prove that they haven’t (killed the teenager) is on BJP. Only a day before, my Mathabhanga candidate Girish Chandra Burman, who is a very respected Rajbanshi litterateur, was injured. People didn’t like this attack. This incident was an attempt to divert attention from that incident,” she said. According to Banerjee’s revised travel schedule released on Tuesday, she is likely to fly down to Cooch Behar by 10am. After spending time in Mathabhanga with the victims, she will address no less than four public rallies in Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling before returning to Nadia to speak at a rally in Haringhata in the evening. The schedule is aimed at completing all her public engagements by Wednesday evening before the 72-hour silence period kicks in ahead of fifth-phase polling. The rallies are in Dhupguri, Jalpaiguri, Dabgram-Fulbari, Matigara-Naxalbari and Harighata. The CM said the state had sought EC’s permission to compensate the victims’ families. She also ordered a CID inquiry into the deaths that was still to be ratified by the poll panel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mamata-to-meet-families-of-sitalkuchi-firing-victims-today/articleshow/82056495.cms||---

During campaigning, Mondal reportedly said no one would be able to compete with Trinamool in the “khela (game)” this time. “Khela hobe; bhayankar khela hobe (It is time for a game; a deadly game),” he allegedly said, prompting the BJP to claim that the Trinamool leader was indirectly threatening saffron workers. It may be recalled that Mondal had initiated the ‘khela hobe’ phrase that later became a popular Trinamool slogan in the run-up to the polls. The BJP, in its complaint to EC, said Mondal through innuendos repeatedly asked Trinamool workers to beat up rivals and hence, BJP workers were “feeling threatened”. The party urged the EC to take action. Mondal denied having violated the model code of conduct. “I said, ‘pagar par kore debo’. They (The BJP) should consult the dictionary for the meaning. Had I said anything to violate the model code, the EC would have placed me under house arrest,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/khela-hobe-comment-anubrata-faces-ec-show-cause/articleshow/82056457.cms||---

The cubs and their mother are fine and under constant watch.” With the additions, Darjeeling zoo now has twelve snow leopards. “We are the only zoo in the world for conservation and breeding of snow leopards in captivity. Our next project will be to see if the snow leopards can be released back in the wild,” Rai added. Zima and Namkha had given birth to a pair in 2018. Namkha was brought from Mulhouse Zoo in France, while Zima came from a Polish zoo in 2014. “The cubs are presently feeding on their mother’s milk. After three months, they will be given the taste of chicken along with other supplements,” Rai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/darjeeling-zoo-welcomes-3-snow-leopard-cubs/articleshow/82056615.cms||Deep Gazmer
---||Kolkata||West Bengal assembly polls: EC’s 48-hour ban on Rahul Sinha, notice to Dilip Ghosh for Sitalkuchi comments||KOLKATA: The Election Commission on Tuesday banned BJP leader and Habra candidate Rahul Sinha from campaigning for the next 48 hours for his statement that central forces “should have killed eight persons instead of only four” in Sitalkuchi. The poll panel also asked state BJP president Dilip Ghosh to explain by 10am on Wednesday his “there will be Sitalkuchi-like incidents across Bengal” comment and let off BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari with a warning for his “mini Pakistan” comments during campaigning for Nandigram. The EC decisions came a day after it barred Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee from campaigning for 24 hours, from 8pm on Monday to 8pm on Tuesday, for her “don’t split minority votes” appeal and “gherao central forces” comments; the poll panel found Banerjee’s comments “highly insinuating and provocative remarks laden with serious potential of breakdown of law-and-order and... adversely affecting the election process”. The Trinamool had complained to the EC about statements on the Sitalkuchi incident made by BJP leaders Ghosh, Sinha, state party secretary Sayantan Basu and Barrackpore MP Arjun Singh. Four villagers died in CISF firing at a booth in Cooch Behar’s Sitalkuchi last Saturday. CM Banerjee called it “genocide” and “pre-planned... mass murder” but the BJP blamed her for the incident, saying she had instigated villagers. The EC said Sinha’s statement during a Habra campaign rally on Sunday violated the model code of conduct for polls, the Representation of People Act and the Indian Penal Code. It found the statement “highly provocative... mocking human life, inciting forces that could have serious law-and-order implications... adversely affecting the election process”. The EC ban on campaigning by Sinha will be in force till Thursday noon. Habra votes on April 22. The EC passed the order without giving any notice to Sinha because of the “urgency” involved. The EC issued a notice to BJP state president Ghosh on Tuesday, giving him an opportunity to explain why he said: “You have seen what happened in Sitalkuchi. There will be Sitalkuchi in several places. So be careful.” The EC also referred to his “dushtu chhele (naughty boy)” barb at the dead and the injured in the CISF firing: “Those naughty boys were shot in Sitalkuchi. These naughty boys will not be there in Bengal. This is just the beginning.” The EC said it “is of the considered view” that Ghosh’s statement “prima facie” violated the model code of conduct, the Representation of People’s Act and several IPC sections. Ghosh has neither explained nor repeated his statements made during a Baranagar poll rally on Sunday. The poll panel, however, warned Adhikari “and advised him to desist from using such statements while making public utterances” when the model code of conduct was in force. He said in the run-up to the April 1 voting in Nandigram that the place would become a “mini Pakistan” if people voted for “Begum”. “Begum is competing against us,” he said, adding: “On the other hand, here is the son of your family, your younger brother, your friend, elder brother for my juniors. Who would you... accept, tell me? You are not giving votes to Begum. If you vote for Begum, there will be mini-Pakistan. A Dawood Ibrahim has come up in your locality. We will note down everything.” He then mentioned a Hindu festival and the BJP’s lotus symbol. CPIML Central Committee member Kavita Krishnan and the Trinamool Congress had lodged a complaint with the EC. Adhikari, in his response to the EC notice, said he believed in “free, fair and impartial elections where there is no ill will between candidates and no personal attack is made” and claimed he had no “mala fide intention to criticise anyone personally” and added that he had “never appealed to citizens on caste or communal lines for securing votes”. The EC then decided to let him off with a warning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ecs-48-hr-ban-on-sinha-notice-to-dilip-for-sitalkuchi-comments/articleshow/82056956.cms||---

Health department officials said that people often wear face masks under the chin, defeating the purpose of having the mask in the first place. But when TOI visited Sonari Police Station in Jamshedpur, it became clear that not just common citizens but even government personnel don’t adhere to Covid protocols. Most of the personnel at the Sonari Police Station were not wearing any kind of mask. When questioned about the apparent violation of Covid protocols, a policeman said on the condition of anonymity that wearing masks during duty hours in hot, humid weather of Jharkhand becomes difficult. But, unfortunately, even hand sanitizers were not seen at the police station. A retired doctor from MGMMCH, Anita Banerjee, criticised the state government for not making public announcements highlighting the importance of wearing masks and washing hands regularly, like it was done last year. The doctor said that if steps were not taken fast to curb the spread of the virus, the second wave could become more alarming. Banerjee added that people must also be advised to stay indoors as far as possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/covid-test-for-those-wearing-masks-in-improper-way-in-jsr/articleshow/82061521.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Many small nursing homes & hospitals hit by erratic supply||MUMBAI: It was past midnight on Sunday when Dr Prince Surana got an SOS call from a nearby nursing home in Chembur, saying its oxygen supply would barely last for two more hours and it had Covid-19 patients dependent on it. Luckily, he had stocks and dispatched six cylinders from his Surana Sethia Hospital. At the other end of the city, Dr Saurabh Sangore from Phoenix Hospital in Borivli counselled families of critical Covid-19 patients about the erratic oxygen supply. "I had supply for 24 hours, but I felt morally obligated to tell them I had no way of knowing when my next supply would come," he told TOI. Many small hospitals and nursing homes drafted by the BMC into Covid care a fortnight ago are suffering due to the erratic oxygen supply. "This is a weak link that no one thought about," said a public hospital doctor about the decision to allow small nursing homes to admit severely ill Covid patients. Around 1,250 MT of oxygen is produced in the state every day; at the moment 200 MT is available as surplus and could last for 2-3 days. Teacher dies during shifting from oxygen-stressed hospitalThe families of critical patients at Borivli’s Phoenix Hospital complained that the hospital kept asking them to transfer their patients, citing an oxygen shortage. In the process, tragedy struck the family of a 43-year-old teacher who was admitted for 18 days with Covid in the hospital. On Monday, the teacher’s CT scan score was a precarious 23/25 when her family was rushing around looking for a hospital where they could transfer her. “We were constantly told that the oxygen supply would run out and with difficulty we managed to get a ventilator bed at the BMC-run Nesco field hospital in Goregaon,” said her brother. She suffered a stroke in the ambulance and was declared dead on admission at the BMC centre. Phoenix hospital managed to get oxygen supply. But oxygen is not the only element in short supply: ICU beds, ventilators, CT scan appointments and remdesivir are other Covid essentials that are difficult to come by in the city. Goregaon resident Anand K spent the whole of Tuesday trying to get a CT scan appointment for his 60-year-old uncle. “One of the centres told me they were booked the entire day,” he said. He was told people who could not get RT-PCR appointments because laboratories had run out of kits were being told to get a CT scan instead. Surana said he gets almost 200 calls a day for beds, oxygen or remdesivir. “The situation is terrifying,” said Surana, who is going to convert his third hospital in the city in Malad into a Covid centre soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-many-small-nursing-homes-hospitals-hit-by-erratic-supply/articleshow/82058337.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||India||‘No need to worry, but we do need to prepare’||An Israeli study rang alarm bells when it suggested that those vaccinated might be eight times as susceptible to the South Africa variant of Covid-19 as those not vaccinated. Leading virologist Dr Gagandeep Kang during an interaction with TOI explains why the implications are not as dire as they sound. Are the findings of the Israeli study as bad as they sound? If not why not?The study took people who were infected after vaccination (either full immunization with two doses or partly immunized, from the time the first dose is expected to kick in to until the second dose kicks in, that is from two weeks after first dose until one week after second dose) and matched them to unvaccinated people with infection. Most infections were due to B.1.1.7 (UK variant) and there was some reduced effectiveness in the partially immunized, but there were a small number with B1.351 (South Africa variant), with eight cases in fully vaccinated individuals and one in unvaccinated. This sounds worrying and looks like the vaccine is not working against B1.351. But there were no cases of B1.351 more than 14 days after the second dose. What does this mean? It is possible that while this study design did show early reduced effectiveness against B1.351, the vaccine effect is kicking in later, enough to stop subsequent infections. We will need other studies to confirm whether this is indeed the case. Though this study is about Pfizer vaccine specifically, would it have any implications for other vaccines?All vaccines based on spike proteins might have similar issues and we need to conduct exactly the kind of vaccine effectiveness studies that are being rolled out across the world. The WHO has guidance on how these studies should be done, even in poorer setting without the kinds of surveillance systems available in wealthier countries. Since we are not using the Pfizer vaccine and the South African variant is not very prevalent in India, is there any cause for worry in India?The worry is about variants and how vaccines will perform. This study is about the Pfizer vaccine, but studies using other vaccines in other settings will also give us early warning about what we should expect with variants. I do not think we need to worry, but we do need to prepare. Without the ability to measure the extent of the problem before and after any interventions, we will be applying control measures without understanding their impact. That is not science, it is shooting in the dark. Considering that we have identified variants in India, and much of the current surge is attributed to variants, what does that imply for our vaccination strategy?Based on the limited sequencing data from India, we know we have the UK variant in Punjab. In the UK, there was a near vertical climb in cases with this variant, which is more transmissible and causes more severe disease. As far as we know, we have much less of the socalled South African and Brazilian variants, and they may not be spreading as much. The 'double mutant' or B1.617 has been found in a fair proportion of cases, but we have still not put together the pieces to figure out how much this variant is contributing to disease, and what virus biology predicts for vaccine performance. We need to establish the ability to study disease and spread at finer scale in the community and much deeper in the laboratory and then synthesize the data to predict what this might mean for our vaccination strategy. As far as I am aware, we do not have the comprehensive and integrated research approach that is really needed, that operates at the speed and scale that is needed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-need-to-worry-but-we-do-need-to-prepare/articleshow/82058330.cms||Rema Nagarajan

In this regard, India welcomed France’s decision to take up the ‘Maritime Resources’ pillar of India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative, the government said in a statement after a meeting between foreign minister S Jaishankar and his counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian. The two ministers also held discussions on a number of regional and global issues of mutual interest, reiterating their shared commitment to a multipolar world and faith in multilateralism, the government said. Looking to tap the full potential of bilateral trade and economic relations, both sides recognised the importance of fast-tracking the discussions on an India-EU trade and investment agreement. “In the context of the changes in a Covid-impacted world, both ministers recognised the immense opportunities for greater collaboration in diverse sectors such as trade and investments, defence and security, health, education, research and innovation, energy and climate change,” the statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-france-explore-ways-to-strengthen-ties-in-indo-pacific/articleshow/82058350.cms||---

The state has rolled out the direct benefit transfer (DBT) for the first time, but collection of blank cheques, and in some cases signed cheques, by arthiyas has turned out to be a concern for farmers who have been left in a state of confusion. Sources said the relation between arthiyas and farmers, who are now getting the MSP amount in their bank accounts, is a matter of their “mutual understanding”, but it is keeping a close eye on this. In Punjab, five state agencies procure foodgrains and they pay MSP. The Food Corporation of India reimburses the amount to the state procurement agencies when it lifts the stocked grains. “The procurement agencies raise loans from banks only because there is an assurance that FCI will reimburse the amount for grains procured by them. So, ultimately, the payment goes from the Centre. Now there is no need to rock the boat when the state has finally agreed to implement the DBT after several extensions,” said a source. Meanwhile, several farmers said the arthiyas are taking blank cheques to be assured about the return of their loans or even interest amount on loans advanced to farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/farmers-confused-as-punjab-arthiyas-seek-blank-cheques/articleshow/82058360.cms||Neel Kamal
---||World||No evidence anyone has got Covid by touching a surface: US experts||When the coronavirus began to spread in the US last spring, many experts warned of the danger posed by surfaces. Americans responded in kind, wiping down groceries and clearing drugstore shelves of Clorox wipes. Facebook closed two of its offices for a “deep cleaning.” New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority began disinfecting subway cars every night. But the era of “hygiene theater” may have come to an unofficial end this week, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its surface cleaning guidelines and noted that the risk of contracting the virus from touching a contaminated surface was less than 1 in 10,000 (that’s less than 0.01%). “Evidence has demonstrated that the risk by this route of infection of transmission is actually low, Dr Rochelle Walensky, CDC’s director said at a recent White House briefing. The admission is long overdue, scientists say. “Finally,” said Linsey Marr, an expert on airborne viruses at Virginia Tech. “We’ve known this for a long time and yet people are still focusing so much on surface cleaning.” She added, “There’s really no evidence that anyone has ever gotten Covid-19 by touching a contaminated surface.” Over the last year, it has become increasingly clear that the virus spreads primarily through the air — in both large and small droplets, which can remain aloft longer — and that scouring door handles and subway seats does little to keep people safe. “The scientific basis for all this concern about surfaces is very slim — slim to none,” said Emanuel Goldman, a microbiologist at Rutgers University, who wrote last summer that the risk of surface transmission had been overblown. “This is a virus you get by breathing. It’s not a virus you get by touching.” The CDC has previously acknowledged that surfaces are not the primary way that the virus spreads. But the agency’s statements this week went further. “The most important part of this update is that they’re clearly communicating to the public the correct, low risk from surfaces, which is not a message that has been clearly communicated for the past year,” said Joseph Allen, a building safety expert at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “What this does very usefully, I think, is tell us what we don’t need to do,” said Donald Milton, an aerosol scientist at the University of Maryland. “Doing a lot of spraying and misting of chemicals isn’t helpful.” “Disinfection is only recommended in indoor settings — schools and homes — where there has been a suspected or confirmed case of Covid-19 within the last 24 hours,” Dr Walensky said during the White House briefing. “Also, in most cases, fogging, fumigation and wide-area or electrostatic spraying is not recommended as a primary method of disinfection and has several safety risks to consider.” Saskia Popescu, an infectious disease epidemiologist at George Mason University, said that she was happy to see the new guidance, which “reflects our evolving data on transmission throughout the pandemic.” But she noted that it remained important to continue doing some regular cleaning — and maintaining good hand-washing practices — to reduce the risk of contracting not just the coronavirus but other pathogens too. Allen said that the school and business officials he has spoken with this week expressed relief over the updated guidelines, which will allow them to pull back on some of their intensive cleaning regimens. “This frees up a lot of organizations to spend that money better,” he said. Schools, businesses and other institutions that want to keep people safe should shift their attention from surfaces to air quality, he said, and invest in improved ventilation and filtration. “This should be the end of deep cleaning,” Allen said, noting that the misplaced focus on surfaces has had real costs. “It has led to closed playgrounds, it has led to taking nets off basketball courts, it has led to quarantining books in the library. It has led to entire missed school days for deep cleaning. It has led to not being able to share a pencil. So that’s all that hygiene theatre, and it’s a direct result of not properly classifying surface transmission as low risk.” NYT||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/no-evidence-anyone-has-got-covid-by-touching-a-surface-us-experts/articleshow/82058375.cms||Emily Anthes
---||Business||Mum investor accumulates 7.2% stake in McLeod Russel||Kolkata: Niraj Rajnikant Shah, a Mumbai-based investor, has so far cornered 7.2% stake in McLeod Russel of Williamson Magor Group. Till the end of the last fiscal, Shah had around 6.9% stake in the company. There is a strong speculation in the industry circle whether Shah is a strategic investor or probable hostile acquirer for debt-ridden Williamson Magor Group. McLeod Russel used to be the largest bulk tea producer in the world. Shah has recently acquired 1.6% in Likhita Infrastructure, which is in oil and gas infrastructure. When contacted, McLeod chairman Aditya Khaitan told TOI that Shah has no connection with the group. He must be an investor, I have no idea,” he said. The Burman family, which is the promoter of Dabur, is currently the single-largest shareholder of Eveready Industries of Williamson Magor Group with 19.8% stake. The promoters’ shareholding falls below even 5% level in the company after banks and financial institutions continue to invoke and sell the pledged shares for recovery of their dues. However, according to industry observers, Burmans have acted as more of a White Knight investor as of now. The shareholding of Williamson Magor Group in the tea giant is 17.4% as per March, 2021, filing. Promoter holding in McLeod Russel dipped below 35% in early 2019 as financial creditors kept on selling invoked shares in the open market. The promoters’ pie in the debt-hit tea company fell by more than 7% during the June quarter of 2019-20 from 42.71% in 2018-19. The tea plantation company has already sold 19 of 48 tea estates in Assam over the last few years in order to pare its massive debt burden. The company’s auditor, Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP, had earlier said that its ability to continue as a going concern will solely depend on the acceptance of the refinancing proposal by its lenders, which is not wholly within the control of the company. The Williamson Magor Group company is in talks with lenders for refinancing its loans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mum-investor-accumulates-7-2-stake-in-mcleod-russel/articleshow/82056232.cms||---

The state’s decision to allow e-commerce deliveries only for essential products has triggered concerns among e-tailers over challenges of following the guidelines. Industry executives said this is reminiscent of last year’s lockdown across India when the definition of ‘essentials’ changed quickly as people stayed home and worked from their houses. Maharashtra is one of the largest e-commerce markets in India, particularly due to the capital Mumbai. Typically, groceries, medicines and food are considered essentials for online deliveries. But e-commerce platforms had seen surge in demand for work-from-home equipment, personal care, home and kitchen appliances as consumers spent more time online and indoors during the lockdown last year. “Allowing essentials only is a massive execution problem. The definition of essential changes from one consumer to the other. This could get very difficult,” a senior e-commerce executive said. At least two other industry executives echoed the same. Last year, e-tailers also had to make a large set of products — those that were not considered ‘essential’ — unavailable on their platforms when consumers tried buying them. In an interview with TOI in May last year, Amazon India head Amit Agarwal had said the characterisation of ‘essentials’ is “very ad-hoc” and that it changes from customer to customer. He had said it’s best to let a consumer decide what’s essential. Spokespeople of Amazon India and Flipkart did not have immediate comments on the matter on Tuesday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/e-tailers-fret-over-mahas-essential-products-rule/articleshow/82058391.cms||Digbijay Mishra
---||Bhubaneswar||Odisha: New year a washout for 2nd straight year||BHUBANESWAR: For the second consecutive year, Odia new year and Maha Bishuba Sankranti will be celebrated in a subdued manner on Wednesday amid a ban on community gatherings and temple visits due to the surge in Covid-19 cases. People said they had missed the celebrations and the distribution of traditional Odia beverage pana due to the pandemic last year. Maha Bishuba Sankranti is one of the major festivals of the Odia people. “The corona pandemic has taken the sheen off all festivals for the past one year. Last year, we could not visit temples or conduct any cultural programmes. This year, too, there are restrictions on public gathering and visiting temples. The pandemic is affecting community life in a big way,” said Debashis Acharya, a resident of Sastri Nagar. The first day of Baisakha, the first month of the Odia new year, is called Maha Bishuba Sankranti. The year begins when the rays of the sun straighten towards the northern hemisphere and the sun moves into Aries. “On the occasion of Odia new year, we release the new almanac, which people refer to to determine auspicious dates and times for any event. The almanac is read in temples to mark the beginning of the Odia calendar year as well,” said Biranchi Narayan Mishra, an astrologer. Many have cancelled visits to friends and relatives; instead they have decided to greet people virtually. “Thanks to social networking sites, a large number of youths have been actively participating in the celebrations of Odia new year for the last few years. Social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp are flooded with greetings and messages on Odia new year,” said Anupriti Dash, a college student. Several cultural and literary organisations are planning to organise virtual meetings, poetry recitation sessions, book release session and literary discussions online.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/odisha-new-year-a-washout-for-2nd-straight-year/articleshow/82058534.cms||Minati Singha
