---||Kolkata||Good Samaritans help those in home isolation with free ghar ka khaana||Saptarshi Basu (name changed) asked his trusted domestic help to go on a month’s leave after he, along with his elderly parents and wife, tested COVID positive last week. As the family grappled to manage household chores while suffering from acute physical and mental distress, they found some solace when Shivangi Roy and her husband Nikhil Roy came forward to help by delivering fresh, home-cooked meals. Shivangi and Nikhil are among the growing breed of good Samaritans spread across the city who are stepping up in this hour of crisis to help families with COVID positive members under home isolation get timely, nutritious meals. Shivangi and Nikhil, who moved to the city from Dubai four months ago, take orders for the next day till 7 pm. After completing all the cooking by noon, they start dispatching the orders. While the couple provides meals free of cost, one has to pay for the delivery that is done through a third party. “We plan to start our own venture soon, but in these difficult times, we want to contribute in whatever little way we can. There are many families who are not in a position to do the chores due to their illness and we are happy to cook and deliver meals to them,” said Shivangi. ‘We’re indebted to Samaritans’At a time when every second or third social media post is about people requesting help for their close ones who have contracted COVID, such gestures are proving to be a big relief for affected families. “It took us days to get the test results. With symptoms manifesting fast, we were not only in physical distress, but also at our wits’ end. The meals that we are receiving, along with the kind help from our neighbours who are constantly getting us medicines and everything that we need, are such a relief. We are indebted to them,” said Saptarshi. Roshni Baid, a gemologist, has started a similar service with her mother Venus and sister Ishika. “Seeing COVID cases rise every day, my mother thought we should do something to help the sick,” said Roshni. The women start their day at 6.30 am and cook till 4.30 in the evening, preparing pure vegetarian breakfast and lunch. “We wanted to include dinner too, but couldn’t. Cooking, packing and delivering for 100 people is a gigantic task and all three of us are constantly working either in the kitchen or packing food in the living room,” said Roshni, who has spent around Rs 60,000 on this initiative and does not charge any money for the service. Help for neighbours & beyondWhile Shivangi, who is based in Santoshpur, caters to people around Jadavpur, Patuli and Garia, Lansdowne Road’s Roshni tries to reach out to as many neighbourhoods as she can. Anurag Saha, an ad agency employee, and his sister Asmita, an MA student, have convinced their mother, Tapashi, to cook meals for COVID patients recovering at home. “We’re based in Behala and currently delivering food to Thakurpukur, Tollygunge and localities around Jodhpur Park. Our home kitchen allows us to prepare food for 10 to 15 individuals only. But every small help counts at this time,” said Asmita. Free meals, charges for delivery onlyMost of these good Samaritans are not seasoned chefs with big kitchen set-ups. Barring a few home chefs, most of them have undertaken such tasks for the first time in their lives. Ballygunge-based Monika Poddar started an initiative four days back with her limited resources, which enable her to send food to six people every day. “I haven’t calculated the amount spent on this because making money is the last thing on my mind when the world is fighting a never-seen-before crisis,” she said. While most residents are offering their services free of cost, those who do not have arrangements for delivery are just charging for delivery. Community workers, restros come forward to helpHelp is pouring in from professional kitchens as well. Community worker Satnam Singh Ahluwalia and his team have been cooking and distributing meals since the onset of the pandemic. “Last March, when the lockdown was imposed, I got a phone call at night from the Kolkata Municipal Corporation commissioner. He asked me if we could provide langar to those living in temporary shelters from the next day. That was the beginning. With the second wave raging on, we have upped our efforts and are providing round-the-clock service. We are serving people waiting outside hospitals, praying for their loved ones. During these trying times, there are many families where all members are down with the virus and we are there to provide them with fresh meals,” he told us. Park Street’s Oasis is one of the restaurants serving food to the needy since the first lockdown. Due to the present crisis situation, restaurant owners are not able to go out and distribute food. Every day, they cook and hand over the food to an NGO that distributes it among the relatives of COVID patients waiting outside city hospitals. “Besides, some of the food is regularly collected by Kolkata Police personnel who distribute it to street dwellers and the needy,” said owner Pratap Darianani. Focus on a frill-free menu, packed with proteinKeeping the dietary requirements of COVID patients in mind, meal providers are keeping their menu simple. A typical meal comprises khichuri, rice, roti, dal, sabzi, fish, egg and chicken. “My mother uses less spices and oil even in our daily meals. For COVID patients, she prepares wonderful meals using just ginger, garlic and a few basic spices. My brother and I are hoping that this will help the patients increase their protein intake,” said Asmita. Central Kolkata-based home chef M, who usually prepares gourmet meals for her clients, is offering a simple menu to COVID patients. “We all know they need protein-based diets. So, I am making a khichdi with three pulses: urad, moong and chhola. Adding chicken and veggies makes it even more nutritious. All I use is ginger, garlic and a bit of regular spices. I see a lot of families down with Covid. I thought they should have a source of good, nutritious meal. that's why I started it,” said M, who uses biodegradable packaging.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/good-samaritans-help-those-in-home-isolation-with-free-ghar-ka-khaana/articleshow/82264219.cms||Bishwabijoy Mitra
---||World||US to share AstraZeneca shots with world after safety check||WASHINGTON: The US will begin sharing its entire stock of AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines with the world once it clears federal safety reviews, the White House said Monday, with as many as 60 million doses expected to be available for export in the coming months.  The move greatly expands on the Biden administration's action last month to share about 4 million doses of the vaccine with Mexico and Canada. The AstraZeneca vaccine is widely in use around the world but has not yet been authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration.  The White House is increasingly feeling assured about the supply of the three vaccines being administered in the US, particularly following the restart of the single-dose Johnson & Johnson shot over the weekend. The US has also been under mounting pressure in recent weeks to share more of its vaccine supply with the world, as countries like India experience devastating surges of the virus and others struggle to access doses needed to protect their most vulnerable populations.  "Given the strong portfolio of vaccines that the US already has and that have been authorized by the FDA, and given that the AstraZeneca vaccine is not authorized for use in the US, we do not need to use the AstraZeneca vaccine here during the next several months," said White House Covid-19 coordinator Jeff Zients. "Therefore the US is looking at options to share the AstraZeneca doses with other countries as they become available."  More than 3 million people worldwide have died of Covid-19, including more than 572,000 in the US The US has vaccinated more than 53% of its adult population with at least one dose of its three authorized vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and J&J, and it expects to have enough supply for its entire population by early summer.  About 10 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine have been produced but have yet to pass review by the FDA to "meet its expectations for product quality," Zients said, noting the US regulator is recognized as the "gold standard" for safety around the world. That process could be completed in the next several weeks. About 50 million more doses are in various stages of production and could be available to ship in May and June pending FDA sign-off.  The US has yet to finalize where the AstraZeneca doses will go, Zients said. Neighbors Mexico and Canada have asked the Biden administration to share more doses, while dozens of other countries are looking to access supplies of the vaccine.  "We're in the planning process at this point in time," said White House press secretary Jen Psaki, when asked where the doses would go.  The AstraZeneca doses will be donated by the US government, which has contracted with the company for a total of 300 million doses - though the company has faced production issues.  The administration's move to share vaccines drew praise from nongovernmental aid groups, who encouraged the White House to develop plans to share even more doses.  "The Biden administration's decision to begin sharing AstraZeneca vaccines is welcome news and an important first step towards the US sharing more of its massive vaccine stockpile," said Tom Hart, acting CEO at The ONE Campaign. "The Biden administration should build on this welcome first step and start sharing more vaccines as soon as possible."  In part because the AstraZeneca vaccine is not expected to play a significant factor in the US virus response, the White House was also moving to share raw materials for the production of the AstraZeneca vaccine with India, which has emerged as a global hotspot for the virus, by diverting some of its orders to the vaccine manufacturer Serum Institute of India.  Zients told the AP that the Biden administration was working to satisfy other "key requests" from the Indian government, namely for personal protective equipment, tests, therapeutics and supplies of oxygen and respiratory assistance devices.  "The administration's identified US commercial suppliers of therapeutics that are immediately available to help relieve the suffering of the Covid-19 patients in India," said Zients. "We've identified rapid diagnostic tests and supplies and PPE, and additional ventilators that are available to transferred to India."  Epidemiologists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were also expected to soon travel to India to assist the country with its virus response.  The additional quality review before the US shares the AstraZeneca doses were in order because of issues at the facility that produced them, White House officials said.  AstraZeneca's doses in the US were produced at an Emergent BioSolutions plant in Baltimore that has come under increased regulatory and public scrutiny after botching batches of the J&J vaccine. The US pressed J&J to take over the plant and, as part of the effort to ensure the quality of newly produced vaccines, directed the facility to stop making the AstraZeneca shot. AstraZeneca is still looking to identify a new US production facility for its future doses.  The US government ordered enough for 150 million Americans before issues with the vaccine's clinical trial held up clearance. The company's 30,000-person US trial didn't complete enrollment until January, and it still has not filed for an emergency-use authorization with the FDA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-to-share-astrazeneca-shots-with-world-after-safety-check/articleshow/82264973.cms||---
---||India||US government jolts into action to aid India after criticism of silence||WASHINGTON: The US on Monday rolled out a series of supportive measures to help India’s titanic fight against the Covid-19 upsurge, including diverting raw material to the Serum Institute of India to manufacture vaccines, and rushing oxygen-generating systems and the drug Remdesivir, even as President Biden pledged America’s full support to provide emergency assistance and resources to New Delhi. Senior US administration officials outlined a series of steps to aid India’s fight after Biden phoned PM Modi to express sympathy and support after nearly three days of silence on the dire situation in India. “India was there for us, and we will be there for them,” Biden said in a tweet minutes after the phone call. Officials said the US was also deploying a CDC strike team to India to help the country’s efforts. The US, however, will not be directly supplying its unused stockpile of AstraZeneca vaccine — at least for now. White House officials said India had not asked for the vaccine and added that the FDA was yet to complete its safety review. Once that process is complete, about 10 million vaccines will become available for foreign supply (since the US will not be using AstraZeneca) and a further 50 million vaccines will be available by June-July. Today, I spoke with Prime Minister @narendramodi and pledged America’s full support to provide emergency assistance… https://t.co/ijdTPoNKct— President Biden (@POTUS) 1619461178000White House National Security Council officials also declined to answer questions on the Indian request for a waiver of intellectual property and patent rights in relation to the fight against Covid, while confirming Modi had raised the matter in his phone conversation with Biden. They bumped the issue across to the US trade representative’s office. Shortly after his call with Biden, Modi had tweeted: “Had a fruitful conversation with @POTUS @JoeBiden today. We discussed the evolving Covid situation in both countries in detail. I thanked President Biden for the support being provided by the US to India.” Slammed across the social, political, and business spectrum for perceived indifference to India, the Biden-Harris dispensation had jolted into action on Sunday. Similar to his Monday post, Biden on Sunday had tweeted: “Just as India sent assistance to the US as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, we are determined to help India in its time of need.” He had conspicuously invoked New Delhi’s help in providing therapeutics to the US during America’s Covid crisis after his administration was trolled for ingratitude. Moments after Biden’s Sunday tweet, vice-president Kamala Harris had posted: “The US is working closely with the Indian government to rapidly deploy additional support and supplies during an alarming Covid-19 outbreak. As we provide assistance, we pray for the people of India-—including its courageous healthcare workers.” Harris too attracted criticism over her silence, particularly in light of her own part-Indian heritage. The full court press from Washington, which some pundits saw as damage control after the administration came under fire from critics on all sides for its slow response, included expressions of support from defence secretary Lloyd Austin, the senior most cabinet official in the Biden administration to visit India, US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield, and deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman, and a host of Democrats. Austin said he was deeply concerned about the Covid-19 outbreak in India, and directed the Pentagon to “use every resources at our disposal, within our authority, to support US inter-agency efforts to provide India’s frontline healthcare workers with the materials they need.” Sherman said she had been in touch with Indian officials, including foreign secretary Harsh V Shringla and India’s ambassador to the US Taranjit Sandhu. The Biden administration ponderous response invited withering assessment. “You can always count on Americans to do the right thing — after they’ve tried everything else,” former Indian envoy Vishnu Prakash remarked, paraphrasing Winston Churchill while noting the episode has cast a shadow on Biden-Harris administration’s earnestness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-us-diverting-raw-materials-to-serum-institute-for-vaccine-production/articleshow/82265240.cms||Chidanand Rajghatta

NITI Aayog member and head of the government’s group on vaccinations, Dr V K Paul said, “It is time people start wearing masks inside their homes as well, especially when everyone is sitting together.” He said mask protocol should definitely be followed if there is a person isolated due to Covid at home to reduce risk of infection. “In this situation, masks are absolutely necessary, so do not go out unnecessarily. Stay with family. And also, even within the family, please wear masks. Do not invite people inside homes. There is a transmissibility angle. We must protect ourselves and our family members to the best of our ability,” Dr Paul said at the weekly briefing on Covid on Monday. The government also highlighted improper use of masks and lack of physical distancing can increase the risk of transmission by 90%. It cited studies to show such a risk with two individuals not wearing a mask and failing to maintain adequate social distancing. The risk gets reduced to 30% if the unaffected person is wearing a mask. The government said studies show an infected patient can end up passing the infection to 406 people in 30 days in the absence of physical distancing. The risk comes down to infecting 2.5 persons in 30 days if he follows physical distancing measures. The government also said in the current circumstances, people with symptoms of Covid-19 should be treated as positive cases even if their RT-PCR status is negative or not available. India on Sunday recorded 3.52 lakh Covid-19 cases. This was the fifth day in a row when over three lakh cases were registered. Amid concerns about RT-PCR test results showing negative despite symptoms of Covid-19, AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria said: “Often it can happen that RT-PCR test is negative because the sensitivity of the test is not 100%. In such situations, if clinical symptoms are classical and there is a close contact who is positive, you should assume you have Covid.” He added that many hospitals have now created a Covid suspect ward for such patients who are awaiting a positive report but have symptoms. “The state of the pandemic being what it is, I think we have to treat these people as Covid patients,” he said. The government maintained there is no shortage of testing or diagnostic kits in the country. The Centre also stressed the need to ramp up vaccination. “We cannot let the pace of COVID-19 vaccination decline or slacken in the face of the emerging situation. In fact, it should be escalated and with that intent the government of India brought a revised (vaccination) policy. We believe and are confident that will bring in more acceleration,” Paul said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-wear-mask-even-inside-home-advises-centre/articleshow/82265734.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||India||People in ‘high’ positions should ‘weigh words’, says BJP chief JP Nadda||KOLKATA: BJP national president JP Nadda, taking note of the observations by the Madras high court holding the Election Commission "singularly responsible" for the second wave of Covid, said people in "high and respectable" positions should "weigh words before using them". Responding to the observations of the Madras HC and Calcutta HC on the poll panel’s role, Nadda said: "We have been strictly adhering to EC directives on maintaining Covid protocol during our campaign. What the Madras HC has said is an observation. I can only say people in high and respectable positions should weigh words before using them." Madras HC Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee came down heavily on the poll panel and held that "EC officers should be probably booked for murder". The BJP national president said he didn’t want to join the "blame game" along with Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee over the shortage of vaccines, medicines and oxygen availability when Covid numbers were reaching a new high in Bengal every day. "We are taking a pro-active role. The Bengal CM gave a miss to the meeting the PM had with CMs on March 17 to discuss the requirement of vaccines and also deliberate before rolling out a comprehensive Covid management plan. A year ago, the state government had kept the central team to Bengal in house arrest. They had come to help out the state in tackling the pandemic," Nadda said at a presser in the city. Earlier, at three virtual meetings in Malda, Birbhum’s Labhpur and Jorasanko in Kolkata, the BJP president pointed out how the Narendra Modi government waived customs duty and health cess on import of vaccines, medicines and oxygen-related equipment for the next three months to address the demand. "The Indian Air Force has been lifting cryogenic oxygen tanks from Singapore and reaching out to states to beef up oxygen supply for Covid patients. Twenty-three mobile oxygen-generating machines have been imported from Germany. PM Modi has also set up a state-of-the-art laboratory in Kolkata to conduct Covid testing," he said. Nadda, returning the Bengal CM’s Covid salvo, said at Jorasanko: "Going by the state’s own account, more and more people are being vaccinated every day. Mamata ji is raising a clamour over vaccines. From where are they coming?"||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/people-in-high-positions-should-weigh-words-says-bjp-chief-jp-nadda/articleshow/82265981.cms||---
---||India||Didi uses Madras HC observation to demand withdrawal of central forces||KOLKATA: West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Monday demanded withdrawal of central forces to contain covid spread in West Bengal in the next phase of polling, while welcoming the Madras HC’s observations that the Election Commission could not avoid blame for the spread of Covid. “Both PM Modi and EC are responsible for the (current) situation (of Covid spreading in the state),” Banerjee alleged at a workers meeting in North Kolkata where party candidates and workers were present. Earlier on Monday, Madras HC had lashed out at the Election Commission over the conduct of Assembly polls amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. “I am requesting please withdraw the around 2 lakh- strong central forces drawn from Covid-hit states, who are camping in schools and colleges and safe homes hampering covid management operations. 75% of them may be infected by the virus. Please withdraw them in the last phase,” she said. Launching a scathing attack on the BJP-led government, Banerjee accused the Centre of being “monumentally incompetent” and lacking planning to tackle Covid-19 surge in the country and said BJP’s single motto is to “capture Bengal anyhow”. Addressing a virtual rally in Shyampukur in Kolkata, the CM said the country is facing difficulties due to Covid-19 “because of ignorance, wrong decisions and negligence of the central government”. “There is no planning on how to contain the Covid surge. They have no plans on how to increase the oxygen capacity and vaccination. There is a deliberate attempt to destroy Bengal first instead of handling the pandemic. It is not expected from a PM,” she added. The CM alleged that the Election Commission and the central forces are acting “at the behest of the BJP”. “The HC’s observations clearly said that the Election Commission cannot ignore its duty. We insisted the commission to club the remaining phases of elections as the Covid situation is intensifying. But EC did not listen to us. It is working under the guidance of the BJP,” she alleged. “EC has brought two lakh central forces from outside Bengal. They are spreading Covid. There has been no RTPCR test conducted on the forces. EC has been transferring officers and deputed two retired police officers as incharge. How can SPs order polling agents not to leave homes on voting day?,” she alleged further. West Bengal saw the seventh phase of polling on 34 seats on Monday. Mamata cast her vote at a polling station in Bhowanipore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/didi-uses-madras-hc-observation-to-demand-withdrawal-of-central-forces/articleshow/82266123.cms||---

Sources told TOI on Monday that EC had received persuasive suggestions to do away with the 1,000 voters-per-polling station limit in view of the decline in active cases in January-February 2021, and restore it to original 1,500. The fall in new daily Covid spike then was accompanied by the vaccination drive picking up pace and signs of economic revival, apparent in GST collection in February 2021 crossing Rs 1.1 lakh crore. “Despite overall improvement in Covid situation, general mood of overall revival and no input available on likelihood of a second wave, Commission decided not to lower its guard. All protocols of Covid were enforced in the poll-going states on the same template as Bihar. Elections to four states, including Tamil Nadu, were over on April 6 before the unprecedented rise of Covid,” an EC official said on the condition of anonymity. Thereafter, for the remaining 5 phases of polling in West Bebgal, EC opted for a dynamic model, assessing the changing Covid situation and accordingly issuing orders on April 9, 16, 21 and 22 , even invoking its plenary powers under Article 324, to progressively impose restrictions on campaign and instruct poll officials to take action under the Disaster Management Act and IPC against political parties/candidates flouting Covid protocols. On April 9, EC reiterated its guidelines on Covid-safe campaign in view of laxity in adherence by parties/candidates and asked them to demonstrate by personal example and nudge supporters at start of rallies to wear masks, use sanitiser etc. It also warned that in cases of breach, it would not hesitate in banning public meetings of the defaulting candidates/star campaigners. On April 16, as parties/candidates continued to throw caution to the wind, EC went a step further to ban rallies, public meetings etc between 7 pm and 10 am and extend ‘silence period’ to 72 hours for the last three phases. Thereafter, on April 21, it wrote to the political parties warning that if Covid guidelines were breached, permissions for further campaigns shall be revoked. Finally, on April 22, EC banned bike rallies, roadshows etc and capped the attendance at public meetings at 500. As many as 307 rallies were cancelled until April 24, 111 show causes issued to various defaulting parties and 75 FIRs lodged under D M Act and IPC. “In hindsight, even if there was a procedural /judgemental delay of a few days in banning rallies/roadshows, making ECI officials criminally liable for deaths is going a bit too far. The enforcement under DM Act has to be ensured by concerned SDMA. At no occasion, the EC takes over the task of SDMA. While EC banned night-time campaign on April 16, no Central or state level lockdown was declared till April 17,” said an officer. It is EC’s Constitutional mandate to complete polls before the expiry of term of a state assembly. Had the polls been delayed, President’s rule in the states concerned would have become necessary, “which would have led to sharper allegations of EC favouring one and acting against another,” an officer pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/didnt-lower-guard-covid-norms-followed-ec-officials/articleshow/82266178.cms||Bharti Jain

The seventh phase recorded an average 75% turnout till 5.30 pm. Polling percentages in the four south Kolkata assembly segments of Bhowanipore, Rashbehari, Ballygunge and Kolkata Port fell substantially over previous years as fear and anxiety kept several residents, particularly the elderly, away from booths for the first time in their lives. Till 5pm on Monday, the four seats had notched up a turnout of 59.9%, lower that the 65.3% recorded from here in the 2016 assembly polls and 66% in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. “During the morning, the turnout was very low from the high-rises. It slightly improved later in the day,” said Debasish Kumar, Trinamool Congress’s Rashbehari candidate.“ A family ritual on a poll day (of voting together) was broken today. This is the first assembly elections in which he couldn’t vote. Party and medical experts advised him not to step out,” said former CM Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee’s wife Meera. Aditi Mukerjea, granddaughter of Deshbandhu CR Das, Kolkata’s first mayor, did not vote for the first time since 1952. Former state advocate general Bimal Chatterjee also did not vote.

Among those listed are Mukul Roy, Subhendu Adhikari, Rajib Banerjee, Babul Supriyo, Raj Chakrabarty, Sayantika Banerjee, Parno Mittra, Koushani Mukherjee, Yash Dasgupta, Rudranil Ghosh, Srabanti Chatterjee, Kanchan Mallick, June Malliah and Vaishali Dalmiya. Addressing them as “Bijemool volunteers”, the post takes a dig at those who had promised to work for the people when they had joined politics. Trinamool’s Barrackpore candidate Raj Chakrabarty claimed his “comrade friends” were spreading the post. “I don’t need to prove to anyone what I’m doing for the people. Interestingly, the post doesn’t share any number of Left candidates. It smacks of hatred. Initially, I had thought it was a prank by fan clubs. Then, I realised it was a handiwork of my jealous ‘comrade friends’. I’m told they often use this term ‘Bijemool’ to belittle us,” he said. Chakrabarty added that the post had made things difficult for Trinamool’s Asansol South candidate Saayoni Ghosh. “On polling day, she had to keep her phone switched off. I got some 10,000 calls. Most of them were from those who wanted to meet me for work in movies. Some were abusive. I used to respect the Leftists. But, how low will they stoop?” Babul and Parno, who are in home isolation after testing Covid-positive, haven’t been spared. BJP’s Yash Dasgupta’s number has become invalid after he received over 5,000 calls since Sunday. “We are seeking legal help to take action against this page. Instead of helping people in distress, this post has harmed them. They can’t reach me now since the phone is constantly busy,” Dasgupta said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/viral-sos-post-forces-candidates-to-switch-off-cells/articleshow/82266278.cms||---

Both the parties claimed that their supporters were injured. Police officers rushed to the spot and a huge police force was deployed in the area. Cops said sticks and brickbats were found at the site and camps of both the parties were vandalised. Earlier, urban development minister Firhad Hakim alleged that his rival candidate Mohammed Mukhtar had snatched voters’ identity cards at Batikal and that these people could not cast their votes. Riding a scooty and cruising along narrow bylanes, Hakim tried to reach the spot from where complaints were pouring in. But Mukhtar apparently left the place before Hakim reached there. Mukhar, however, described his rival’s allegation as being “without any basis.” What became a bigger challenge was maintaining safe distancing and Covid-appropriate behaviour among the voters. At KMC Borough 15 booth, at least six people were seen in the gap between two circles. The central forced and cops were busy driving away curious onlookers rather than enforcing safe physical distancing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tmc-congress-members-fight-pitched-battle-in-kolkata/articleshow/82266331.cms||---

Common intention can’t be established in the case of WhatsApp service users merely acting as administrators,” the division bench of Justices Zaka Haq and Amir Borkar said. Quashing a complaint against a man from Maharashtra’s Gondia for alleged sexual harassment under Section 354-A(1)(iv), read along with Sections 509 and 107 of the IPC and Section 67 of the IT Act, 2000, the bench said a group admin doesn’t have power to regulate, moderate or censor the content before it is posted. “The administrators are the ones who create the group by adding/deleting the members. Every group has one or more administrators, who control members’ participation. A group administrator has limited power of removing/adding the members. Once the group is created, the administrators’ and members’ functions are at par with each other, except addition/deletion powers. But, if a member posts any objectionable content, s/he can be held liable under relevant provisions of law,” the court said. Petitioner Kishor Tarone had moved court after a woman accused him, the admin of a WhatsApp group, of not removing a member who had used obscene language against her. She also alleged that the petitioner failed to ask the member to apologise and instead expressed helplessness.

A source close to Justice Mishra told TOI, “There has been a series of deaths in his extended family. The judge’s brother-in-law died a day after his (Justice Mishra) retirement on September 2 last year and then four more deaths of close relatives followed one after the other, keeping the judge out of station till January. After he weathered the bereavements, his immediate family members, including wife and mother-in-law, got infected with Covid-19.” Times ViewRules are rules. And they must be followed by everyone. When it comes to vacating their bungalows after retirement, most justices follow the rules conscientiously and gracefully. To maintain the apex court’s noble tradition, the retired justice must do the same Sources said the SC had allowed his request to stay in the official residence till March 31. “In the last week of March, Justice Mishra’s wife got infected with Covid-19 and is still in the process of recovery, having got post-quarantine complications. He has sought permission from the SC to extend his stay till April 30. But the SC has not responded to his request. He is not interested in post-retirement government assignments and plans to vacate the bungalow as soon as his wife is medically fit to walk out of the house,” the source said. Perennially short of official accommodation for its judges since Parliament increased the strength of judges in the SC from 26, including the CJI, to 34 in September 2019, the court had been writing to Justice Mishra seeking possession of the bungalow, which should have been vacated by October 2. Rule 4 of Supreme Court Judges Rules, 1959, states, “Each judge shall be entitled without payment of rent to the use of furnished residence throughout his term of office and for a period of one month immediately thereafter, and no charge shall fall on the judge personally in respect of maintenance of such residence. This concession shall also be admissible to members of the family of a judge, who dies while in service, for a period of one month immediately after his death.” Judges who retired immediately before or after Justice Mishra have all vacated their bungalows.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ex-sc-judge-arun-mishra-still-to-vacate-bungalow/articleshow/82266647.cms||---

Till Monday, 22.2 million tonnes of wheat was procured during this Rabi Marketing Season compared to 7.6 million tonnes during the same period last year. The procurement was less during this period in 2020 crops as there was strict nationwide lockdown. The ministry also said nearly 38% of the procurement so far has come from Punjab, followed by Haryana (32%) and Madhya Pradesh (23%). “About 21.17 lakh wheat farmers have already been benefited from the ongoing procurement operations with MSP value of about Rs 43,912 crore. For the first time the procurement of foodgrains in Haryana and Punjab is now being done by directly transferring the MSP amount to their bank accounts. The ministry said this has ensured farmers to get their payment without any delay and cuts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rs-13000-crore-given-to-farmers-directly/articleshow/82266730.cms||---

ADG, law and order, Prashant Kumar said the stringent National Security Act (NSA) and Gangster’s Act would be invoked against all the arrested persons. A total of 747 Remdesivir vials and 349 oxygen cylinders Rs 11.5 lakh and four cell phones have been recovered from the arrested men. Instructing the officials concerned to take stern action against people involved in illegal sale of essential drugs, the CM had said: “It is a crime against humanity and those involved in hoarding and blackmarketing of Covid-19 medicines should be spared. Police should follow zero tolerance policy to instil fear in the minds of culprits.” A senior official in home department said the government was fully committed to ensuring easy availability of Remdesivir and other Covid-related medicines to people. Various other intelligence agencies have been deployed to check illegal sale by carrying out raids and regular monitoring. The control room set up by the Food Safety and Drug Administration (FSDA) to ensure continuous supply of oxygen to hospitals in all districts is active round the clock and is keeping strict vigil to ensure that oxygen is used for medical purposes only. A helpline at district level has also been issued to probe alleged irregularities in procurement of medical equipment related to Covid-19, officials said. “In view of current Covid situation, injections and cylinders recovered from the accused are being used to treat people instead of making them a case property,” another home department official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/police-crack-down-on-black-marketing-of-drugs-oxygen/articleshow/82265471.cms||---

Earlier, on Thursday and Saturday, the capital had reported 357 deaths in a day. In the past 24 days, Delhi has recorded 3,601 deaths averaging 139 daily. In March, average death reported daily was around 4. The number of fresh cases recorded on Monday was 20,201, the lowest in nearly 10 days. However, the low numbers were due to very low testing. In the past 24 hours, data shared by health department shows that 57,690 tests were conducted of which only 38,786 were done using the RT-PCR method. In the second week of April, the city conducted over one lakh tests, of which nearly 70,000 tests were done via the RT-PCR method, considered the gold standard for testing. ALSO READ: Delhi Covid Lockdown news live“Tests have nearly halved in the last few weeks, which is giving a false sense of security about the reducing numbers. However, it also shows that positivity rate remains very high, which means the infection is widespread,” said a senior doctor. On Monday, the positivity rate was 35.02%, meaning nearly one in every three persons being tested was returning a positive result. “We have to do more tests to ensure timely medical intervention. But we are seeing the opposite happening,” a doctor claimed, adding that most labs were refusing to do tests. The number of active cases of Covid-19 in the city touched 92,358, of which 52,733 are under home isolation. Apart from testing, the availability of ICU beds has decreased sharply. As of 11pm on Friday, there was only one ventilator bed available for Covid patients across the city at AIIMS Trauma Centre. With ICUs full in Delhi’s hospitals, many needy patients are turning to the hospitals in neighbouring cities like Faridabad, Gurgaon and Noida. There are more than 20,000 oxygen beds for Covid patients in Delhi. Of them, 18,747 are occupied. ICU beds without a ventilator are rarely available. Doctors say only 15% of Covid patients require hospitalisation. The rest can be managed at home. “Many people are rushing to hospitals when the condition is stable, because they are unsure if they would be able to get timely care once the situation deteriorates. This is also leading to overcrowding,” Dr Arun Gupta, president of the Delhi Medical Council, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/record-380-deaths-deepen-gloom-over-20000-fresh-cases/articleshow/82264611.cms||---
---||Business||RBI caps bank promoter-CEO’s term||MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Monday said that a bank founder can remain CEO for 12 years, which can go up to 15 based on the discretion of the central bank. It also said that CEOs who have already completed the prescribed term on the date of these instructions coming into effect can complete their current term as already approved by the RBI. Currently, the longest-serving chief executive of a commercial bank is Uday Kotak of Kotak Mahindra Bank who has been CEO since the bank received its licence in 2003. The RBI had approved a three-year extension from January 1 for him to continue as CEO. According to a note by Macquarie Research, Kotak, whose term ends on January 2, 2024, will not be eligible for reappointment as he has already completed 15 years as MD & CEO. “Also, in our view, the second in line Dipak Gupta (current joint MD) may not be eligible to succeed as the CEO as the 15-year cap applies for all whole-time directors (WTD) on the board,” the note said. Last year, the bank appointed Gaurang Shah and K V S Manian, veteran ‘Kotakites’, as whole-time directors. The central bank had floated a discussion paper on ‘Governance in commercial banks in India’ on June 11, 2020 to review the framework for governance in commercial banks. The final guidelines have been based on the feedback received. The norms fix an upper age limit of 75 years for all directors and they can be on board for a maximum of two consecutive four-year terms. The new norms will apply to all private lenders including small finance banks. In respect of State Bank of India and nationalised banks, these guidelines would apply to the extent they are consistent with laws applicable to these banks. The circular will not be applicable in the case of foreign banks operating as branches in India. Besides the CEO tenure, the norms require every bank to have an audit committee of the board (ACB) constituted with only non-executive directors (NEDs), excluding the chairperson. Banks are also required to have board-level risk management committee and a nomination and remuneration committee. The RBI further added that the current upper age limit of 70 years will continue to apply for CEOs of private banks and bank boards are free to prescribe a lower age limit. Besides Kotak, another bank that could face uncertainty is Bandhan Bank if the RBI chooses to factor in the tenure of the CEO before the conversion of the finance company into a bank. “The RBI has said that while examining the matter of re-appointment of such MD & CEOs or whole-time directors within the 12/15-year period, the level of progress and adherence to the milestones for dilution of promoters’ shareholding in the bank shall also be factored in and, considering Bandhan’s track record in meeting these shareholding norms, there perhaps could be a reluctance from the RBI in our view,” said Macquarie. According to Rajesh Narain Gupta, managing partner at legal firm SNG & Partners, “To put a cap of 15 years for the top position is a sound proposition — it gives enough time for the vision to be implemented and for the successor to be identified. It de-risks the organisation of a dominant control and concentration of power, which has recently seen the failure of a large bank and NBFCs. It is a good move from the corporate governance point of view in the long term and creates opportunity for new ideas and talent.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-caps-bank-promoter-ceos-term/articleshow/82264949.cms||---

The gains came particularly after the announcement of the country’s phase-3 vaccination programme that opened up vaccine supplies for the private market. Being allowed to supply to private channels could potentially provide a “significant upside” to companies, including Zydus Cadila, Dr Reddy’s, Aurobindo, Strides, Pfizer and Shilpa Medicare in the near term, analysts say. The Centre recently announced the expansion of the vaccination drive to cover those aged 18-45 years. It also allowed vaccines for the private market, where domestic players will have to supply 50% quantity to the central government, and the balance to state governments or private hospitals. With this, there would be a need for an additional 1.2 billion doses (assuming two jabs per person) from May, as around 600 million of the population have now become eligible. “Supplies to the private market would help in raising realisations. But we expect competition to be high from domestic and imported vaccines. This should provide a significant upside in the near term. However, we refrain from assigning a multiple to this opportunity as the earnings sustainability remains uncertain, and there would be a likely increase in competition,” an analyst from ICICI Securities said. Analysts expect certain imported vaccines from US-based companies — Pfizer, Moderna and J&J — to enter the private market. Supplies to the government may continue at around $2 (Rs 150) per dose, while prices in the private market will vary, and could be upwards of Rs 600 per dose, they added. Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech recently announced prices of Covishield at Rs 600 per dose and Covaxin at Rs 1,200 per jab, respectively, for the private market. With a relaxation in guidelines, approved imported vaccines can be supplied to state governments and the private market too. Dr Reddy’s Labs recently received the emergency use authorisation for Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, which will be imported and is likely to be launched by May-end. Zydus Cadila, too, expects an approval to its vaccine ZyCov-D by June on successful completion of phase-3 trials. “For Dr Reddy’s — assuming an average realisation of Rs 600 and 15% ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) margin as exclusive marketing partner — it could provide around 22% upside to FY23 estimated earning. While for Zydus Cadila, assuming approval and average realisation is Rs 600 with 25% ebitda margin, the upside could be around 31% in FY23. At peak capacity utilisation, Aurobindo can get around 17% ebitda upside to FY23 estimate, assuming average realisation of $2 per dose and 15% ebitda margin,” the note added. Aurobindo has developed a vaccine facility for a contract manufacturing organisation, with 480 million doses expected by June. Considering India’s adult population of one billion will account for the largest market for US vaccines, we see 20-25% of US vaccine exports heading to India, a note from Yes Securities said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/stocks-of-pharma-cos-linked-to-vaccines-rally/articleshow/82264986.cms||Rupali Mukherjee
---||Kolkata||Tried online, was put on wait list for bed||My father is 80 and has undergone bypass surgery. When his symptoms started last week on Monday, with coughing, there was the problem in getting the Covid test done as a walk-in test was not possible for him and home collection system is not available now. After somehow managing to do the test, last Thursday, it took over 72 hours to get the report, which came on Monday morning. My father started having breathing trouble from last Friday and, being an octogenarian who has had bypass surgery, doctors said that a low oxygen saturation level was dangerous for him. So the next trouble we faced was that of getting an oxygen cylinder, which was almost not available anywhere. We could not collect a cylinder even after calling several people and medical stores. Finally, we got help from a store which somehow gave us a half-filled oxygen cylinder. Our next ordeal was getting a hospital bed. The situation was turning worse as his breathing trouble was increasing. Searching for a hospital bed online, we got ourselves on the waiting list after about 80 to 100 people at most hospitals. Since Sunday, his oxygen level had dipped below 90 and was hovering around 88 to 89 and hospitalization had become necessary. After a frantic search throughout the day, the local outgoing ward coordinator came forward towards late afternoon and with his help we finally managed to get a bed for my father at a private hospital.

The Gnanapuram crematorium has been witnessing a rush over the last week. While the crematorium would usually see 10–15 bodies a day, now it has been receiving around 40 per day on average. People from other states who underwent treatment here but then passed away are also being cremated here. In the absence of an electric crematorium, bodies are being cremated with firewood. Crematorium staff say that nearly 300 kilos of firewood is necessary to cremate a body and the process takes 90–120 minutes. If the inflow of bodies continues, there will be a shortage of firewood and it will take longer to cremate bodies, they worry. Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) commissioner G Srijana said that the civic body has already set up the electric crematorium and a trial run was held Monday. If all goes according to plan, the facility will start operating from Tuesday, she said. GVMC has spent over Rs 60 lakh to set up the crematorium. Once operational, it is expected to be able to cremate at least 15 bodies a day. Electric crematoriums are cheaper, faster, simpler and pollution-free compared to the firewood method. GVMC officials said that an electric crematorium was launched in the city around two decades ago. Maintenance of the crematorium was then handed over to a private agency. But it gradually fell into disuse. With the sudden rise in deaths and long waiting hours, the electric crematorium has gained in importance. Meanwhile, the state government has restricted the number of people allowed to take part in final rites to 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/new-electric-crematorium-in-vizag-may-start-operating-today/articleshow/82263507.cms||Nalla.Babu

We must ensure proper availability of oxygen along with medicines so that Covid-19 patients do not face any problem. ……Take all necessary steps to meet the requirement of medical oxygen at all Covid-designated government and private hospitals,” Nitish told the officials during a high-level meeting to review the Covid-19 situation in the state. He also said if the requirement of medical oxygen is more than what the Centre has allocated to Bihar, the state government would arrange it on its own. He asked the officials to take necessary steps to purchase additional medical oxygen from the state government’s funds. Nitish further said the Covid-19 cases were increasing day-by-day. As per the experts, the cases would further increase in coming days. He asked the officials to increase the number of Covid beds in all government and private hospitals, including the Patna-based IGIMS. The CM asked the health officials to further ramp up tests and ensure timely delivery of reports so that treatment of the infected could start at the earliest. People in different parts of the state have been complaining about the late delivery of the RT-PCR test reports, leading to confusion among the doctors about the line of treatment. He asked the health officials to engage dentists, Unani and Ayush doctors and even retired doctors in the hospitals to fight against the deadly virus. The CM also instructed all the police officials who have gone to the poll-bound states to get clinically examined on their return. He also ordered regular testing of police forces. Both deputy CMs Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi, health minister Mangal Pandey, development commissioner Amir Subhani and many senior officers attended the meeting through videoconferencing.

Some hotels are on the verge of closure, while other stakeholders of tourism industry, like tourist guides, travel operators and footpath vendors are unable to find any source to make ends meet. The monasteries have not opened their doors for the visitors since March 23 last year. Devotees and the tourists visiting the Mahabodhi Mahavihara also visit the monasteries. Under normal curmstancases, large number of foreign tourists and devotees visit the heritage city, especially during the tourist season from October to February. However, last year, the Mahavihara was first closed on March 22 and was opened on June 10. Again, the shrine was closed from July 16 and opened on September 21. From December 21, the temple had started opening as per its normal timing. However, adhering to the fresh state government order earlier this month, it is again closed. Devotees and the tourists offer donations at Mahavihara and the monasteries. The expenses of monasteries are met with the donation. But in the absence of tourists and the donation as well, the monasteries are finding it hard to manage. Bhikkhu Priyapal, monk in-charge of Chakma Buddhist Monastery, said, “There are around 45 monasteries of foreign countries like Bangladesh, Tibet, China, Thailand, Japan, Myanmar, Vietnam, Laos and others. Around 100 monks besides nearly 500 other staff are associated with these monasteries. Apart from fixed expenses like power bill, holding tax, daily grocery, milk and grains are needed to be arranged to cook meal for monks and other staff. In the absence of tourists, the monasteries have no option to meet the expenses. Bodh Gaya Travel Association vice-president Suresh Singh said, “The condition of hotels is very bad. Even some of the hotels are on the verge of sale. Other stakeholders like tourist guides, travel operators and footpath vendors, who totally depend on the footfall of tourists for their earnings, are now on the lookout for alternate source of income, but they are unable to get any.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/monasteries-at-bodh-gaya-struggle-to-make-ends-meet/articleshow/82263393.cms||---

Even before the state announced the early closure of schools (classes I to IX) due to the spurt in daily case numbers a few days ago, the schools had operated with only some 30-40 per cent of their total faculty strength. Even one year after the emergence of the pandemic, the working teachers and lecturers are drawing only some 60 to 70 per cent of their salaries compared to what they had drawn before the pandemic. And there is no clarity on whether the schools would hire the temporarily retrenched faculty back. It all started with the first wave of Covid-19 forcing the educational institutions to remain closed for almost seven months. Schools had initially paid only some 50 per cent of salaries in the first one to two months into the pandemic. But later, other than for a select few, who were deemed suitable for online teaching, schools declared a no-work-no-pay policy for the rest of their faculty. Conventional classroom teaching resumed only in November last year for higher schools, while primary schools reopened their campuses just two months ago in February. But the second wave necessitated the early closure of schools again. Meanwhile, financial crisis drove a woman teacher to commit suicide in Marikavalasa in Vizag city a few days ago. With no full salaries since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, thousands of teachers have moved away from the profession. Private teachers and lecturers union, Visakhapatnam district president Kalla Lokanadham, said that the pandemic has made the lives of teachers and lecturers miserable. “As the profession is no longer remunerative, some teachers shifted to other jobs such as marketing. The teachers have been caught in the debt trap to sustain their families. Even now, the teachers are worried about their future with the ever increasing cases,” said Lokanadham. M Vara Prasad, a mathematics teacher, said that providing every meal has become a struggle for private teachers. “Meanwhile, several teachers died of Covid-19 in the last one year. The government should extend financial help to the beleaguered teachers along the lines of Telangana government,” said Prasad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/several-have-made-the-shift-to-other-professions/articleshow/82263429.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Delhi||Don’t insist on Covid report for admission: Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Monday directed city hospitals to follow the Delhi government’s circular over not insisting on Covid positive test reports before admitting patients who show symptoms of the infection. Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh further directed the Delhi government to “widely publicise” its April 23 circular over the same. The order came while disposing of a PIL seeking directions to the government to order hospitals not to insist on Covid positive reports to hospitalise patients who show symptoms of coronavirus. The petitioner, Jaideep Ahuja, through his counsel Sachin Puri, said that the Uttar Pradesh government has passed such a direction on not insisting on RT- PCR positive test reports for admitting patients. Advocate Puri said that like the Uttar Pradesh government, the Delhi government should also permit admission of patients showing Covid-19-related symptoms without any RT-PCR test report. Advocate Anuj Aggarwal, appearing for the Delhi government, argued that a direction to this effect had already been issued on April 23. He further stated that such patients were to be accommodated in a designated area for “suspected” cases of Covid-19. Keeping in mind the existing circular, the bench stated that there was no reason to issue any further directions. The Centre had stated that Covid tests were not being conducted in the national capital. The Delhi government, meanwhile, said that its health department had issued a circular on April 23 directing hospitals in the city not to insist on Covid positive test reports to admit patients who were showing symptoms of the infection. The court also directed the government to upgrade its infrastructure related to testing labs and testing centres in view of the prevailing Covid-19 situation in the national capital. The public interest litigation filed by advocates Praveen K Sharma and Dhananjay Grover was against the recent reduction in the number of RT-PCR tests being conducted and against the illegal rejection of hospitalisation on the pretext of non-possession of positive RT-PCR report. The petitioner also sought directions to the respondent to add more testing centres and upgrade the infrastructure for streamlined collection of the RT-PCR samples. IIT scientists working on a mathematical model to predict the course of the pandemic have revised both the timing and value of peak cases, saying the peak for “active” infections may touch 38-48 lakh cases during May 14-18 while the peak for “new” infections may hit 4.4 lakh in the next few days.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh government to take up oxygen audit, track supplies at hospitals daily||AMARAVATI: Amid the growing demand for medical oxygen and continuous surge in case numbers, the state government will take up an oxygen audit. As part of this effort, details of oxygen supply and consumption in each hospital will be collected on a daily basis. Hospitals providing Covid-19 treatment have been directed to provide information on oxygen requirement and consumption in their respective units. “The doctors have also been directed to take a call whether a patient requires oxygen support. Oxygen support should be given on the basis of need but not demands from the patients or their kin,” said deputy chief minister (health) Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas (Nani) here on Monday. The minister said the Centre has been requested to allocate oxygen from other states in view of the critical situation. At a review meeting with officials and legislators in Guntur district collectorate the minister said the state government is taking proactive measures to bring in oxygen from other states including Tamil Nadu, Odisha and Karnataka. The state has oxygen plants to produce about 290 metric tonnes of oxygen against the requirement of 330 metric tonnes, the minister said, adding that the state is getting about 40 metric tonnes from Tamil Nadu, Odisha and Karnataka. Measures are also being taken to revive some defunct oxygen plants, he said. Steps are being taken to supply the oxygen produced in all 42 plants in the state exclusively to hospitals in the state. The minister said the government has decided to grant permissions for 40-bed hospitals to be converted into Covid-19 hospitals in view of the increasing cases. He, however, said that there is no shortage of beds in the state. Nani said the government had not taken any decision with regard to imposing the lockdown in the state. “We have not received any instructions on enforcing lockdown from the Centre. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy is closely monitoring the situation and will take an appropriate call at an appropriate time,” he said. The minister assured that there is no shortage of emergency medicines, including Remdesivir injections in any government hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-to-take-up-oxygen-audit-track-supplies-at-hospitals-daily/articleshow/82263523.cms||Samdani MN
---||Patna||‘Longer hospital stay for patients in 2nd wave’||PATNA: Longer hospital stay is turning out to be a major reason for non-availability of beds, medicines and oxygen in hospitals in the second wave of pandemic in the city. Doctors said over 2,000 fresh Covid cases are being detected per day in the city and most patients develop lung infection, leading to plunge in their blood oxygen level. Such patients, they said, require oxygen support. The doctors said delayed admission has been a major reason for Covid casualties. “As more and more people are requiring oxygen support, ventilator and ICU beds, the overall healthcare system is under stress in the state. However, avoidable hospitalisation is also burdening the already burdened hospitals,” they said. Patna-based senior physician Dr Diwakar Tejaswi said the severity of illness was far more in the second wave of Covid pandemic than the first one. “Recovery of patients is taking longer time in hospitals and home. The sudden surge in daily demand for oxygen, ventilators and medicines has created unprecedented pressure on the healthcare system. Only strict measures by government and Covid-appropriate behaviour by people are the way out to fight the second wave of the pandemic,” Dr Tejaswi said. Former president of state chapter of Indian Medical Association Dr Rajeev Ranjan Prasad said, “A patient is not released until he or she is completely cured. As the number of Covid patients in hospitals is very high, it is leading to more consumption of beds,” he said, adding better care and attention can be given at home with availability of necessary medical support. Muzaffarpur-based senior paediatrician Dr Arun Shah said there was an urgent need for mass vaccination. “Stringent measures should be taken against those defying Covid guidelines,” he added. Meanwhile, people having friends and relatives infected with the virus are finding it difficult to arrange medical essentials for them. Suresh Sharma, a resident of Kankarbagh said, “Get oxygen cylinders or refilling them is a herculean task these days. Even basic medicines prescribed by doctors are either unavailable or being sold at exorbitant prices,” he added. Reema Devi, a resident of Rajeev Nagar, said, “One of my family members is in the process of recovery. However, we remain anxious all the time due to the shortage of medicines and oxygen supply,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/longer-hospital-stay-for-patients-in-2nd-wave/articleshow/82263325.cms||---

Due to heavy police deployment, the SAD leaders and workers could not make it to Ashu’s house and decided to protest at a nearby chowk. Accusing Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh and Ashu of turning a blind eye to the woes of the farmers, SAD leaders and workers burnt the effigy of both of them and also shouted slogans against them and the state government. Speaking on the occasion, former minister Maheshinder Singh Grewal and MLA Sharanjit Singh Dhillon said Congress is playing farmers card to get political mileage but is actually turning blind eye to the problems being faced by the farmers in Punjab’s mandis where the procurement of wheat is already running late compared with rest of the country. They also pointed out that now there is a huge shortage of gunny bags which has increased the woes of the farmers further. According to Gurdeep Singh Gosha, district president of Youth Akali Dal, “Congress government in Punjab is playing a dirty game with the farmers of the state as already the government delayed the procurement and now it has subjected the poor farmers to such hardships that they do not know what to do. Moreover, due to non-lifting of wheat, which has already been procured, large stock of wheat is lying open in the grain markets and in many mandis there is no space left to keep crops and farmers are forced to keep wheat in their trolleys and houses.” According to Ranjit Singh Dhillon, former MLA and district president of SAD, “Food and supplies minister Ashu is directly responsible for this situation and it has been proved now that all his claims about the procurement being done in smooth manner and no shortage of gunny bags are false. That is why today we burnt his effigy so that at least he feels ashamed of himself about what he has done. Along with him we also burnt effigy of CM Amarinder Singh under whose leadership these type of ministers are working.” Some of the prominent leaders present on the occasion included Hira Singh Gabria, Vijay Danav, Gurcharan Singh Grewal, Kuldeep Singh Khalsa, Gurmeet Singh Kular, Surinder Kaur Dyal, Narinder Kaur Lamba, Kawanjit Singh Dua, Parupkar Singh Ghuman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-stages-protest-over-inadequate-arrangements-for-wheat-procurement/articleshow/82266069.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Getting O2 supply was a nightmare||It has been a horrible experience. I never thought getting an oxygen cylinder would be so tough. My husband had developed fever on the night of April 16. The initial antigen test had come negative, but later they advised us to start medicine for him as his infection level was very high. It was after April 20 that his oxygen saturation level started to deteriorate and came down to around 90/91. Nebulizers were given and his oxygen level increased a little. But we went on searching for an oxygen cylinder. However, we could not get one. Somehow, after relentless persuasion at medicine stores, we managed to get a small oxygen can. On April 24, his oxygen level dropped as low as 86. We started to panic and used the oxygen can, which temporarily raised his oxygen level to around 92. The doctors advised immediate hospitalization. We put him in the ambulance and started giving oxygen as we criss-crossed the city to find a hospital bed. The situation turned worse when the ambulance driver asked us to find a hospital as soon as possible saying only one hour of oxygen could be supplied on an emergency basis in the ambulance. At that point I broke down. Finally, with the help of my husband’s friends, we managed to get him admitted to a private hospital. It has been a nightmare.

---||Patna||‘Only 90 private hospitals in Patna allowed to treat Covid patients’||PATNA: The Patna district administration on Monday announced the list of 90 private hospitals within its jurisdiction to provide treatment to the Covid-19 patients. It has banned the Covid treatment in any other private hospital without the permission of the administration. “The treatment against Covid-19 infection in any private hospital other than the 90 listed ones has been banned,” the order by Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh said. The order said the treatment for Covid infection is being given in both government and private hospitals, but the relevant order has been issued to do proper monitoring of the treatment at private hospitals and to also maintain the steady supply of oxygen required by the approved 90 private hospitals, along with the government hospitals. The order stated that not only the infected patients choosing a private hospital outside the approved list will be vulnerable to risks, but the institution itself will invite penal action if any unpalatable incident happened. “There might not be supply of oxygen in those hospitals not on the list, which, in the situation, might put the patients under treatment in the unapproved hospitals in the risk zone,” the order said. “If any unpalatable incident happens, in case the number of beds is increased to accommodate more infected patients without prior permission in private hospitals outside the approved list and the treatment of patients is also done without permission, that private hospital will invite action,” the order stated. The approved private hospitals have been asked not to increase the number of beds without due permission from the authority concerned, since the estimate of the oxygen supply is prepared on the basis of the existing number of beds for the treatment. “The number of beds in the 90 private hospitals can be increased only with the permission from the concerned, so that the estimate of the supply of oxygen can be made. Oxygen is being supplied in government and private hospitals making the optimum use of all the available resources,” the order said. The 90 private hospitals approved include Ruban Memorial Hospital, Ford Hospital, Rajeshwar Hospital, Paras HMRI, Samay Hospital, Asian City Hospital, Medipark Hospital, Narayani Emergency Hospital, Netaji Subhas Medical College, Sri Sai Hospital, Big Apollo Spectra Hospital, Pushpanjali Hospital, Rainbow Emergency, Udayan Hospital, Atlantis Hospital and Satyam Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/only-90-private-hospitals-in-patna-allowed-to-treat-covid-patients/articleshow/82263314.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Business||Jagdish Khattar built scale, ground connect in Maruti||NEW DELHI: In his long and distinguished career spanning well over five decades, Jagdish Khattar — who passed away Monday morning aged 78 following a cardiac arrest — wore many hats, and almost all of them with aplomb. Originally a bureaucrat who, among other achievements, was credited with setting up of now-bustling Noida as its first CEO (on the instructions of Sanjay Gandhi), Khattar transitioned — initially with reluctance — towards the corporate sector in July 1993 when at the age of 50, he resigned as an IAS officer to join what was then Maruti Udyog Ltd, a fledgling car company, jointly controlled by the government of India and Japan’s Suzuki. Initial hesitance apart, Khattar never really looked back since then as he almost single-handedly built the foundations of one of independent India’s most successful public-to-private (sector) companies that today boasts of one of the biggest cash reserves (over Rs 37,000 crore) for a private enterprise, a staggering 50% market share, and a reputation of making all-weather, low-maintenance, value-for-money vehicles that have beaten products from almost all the world’s top makers such as Volkswagen, Toyota, General Motors, Ford and Honda. Khattar’s only known failure was a self-venture ‘Carnation Auto’ (multi-brand car sales and service outlets). The venture after retirement from Maruti kept himself busy till his last days. Khattar always advocated hard for adoption of cycles, which he believed were good for health as well as the environment in choked cities. Carnation Auto, after some success initially, never really took off as Khattar fought a valiant battle against car companies that went up to the Competition Commission of India as he sought access to genuine parts, something that the automakers denied fearing a loss to their own dealerships. He won the case, though it was too late by then and Carnation had to even face a CBI inquiry in December 2019, though Khattar called it a ‘bonafide business failure’. It was at Maruti Suzuki where his real acumen as a sharp, insightful leader came to the fore and where he not only built a large company, but also an institution which made deep inroads into the nooks and corners of India. As an aspirational and growing India started to think of cars, Khattar not only launched affordable models, but ensured that they were sold and serviced close to where people lived. The theme was even captured in Maruti’s campaigns that spoke about the company’s dealerships and service ability even in far-flung areas of the north and north-east. For dealers, Khattar made business more than just selling cars as he introduced new revenue streams through the concept of selling used cars, insurance, and financing. But for all the success, Khattar was not even sure to join Maruti in the first place. “It meant quitting the IAS, and I had to literally persuade him to join Maruti and convince him that it was a good option,” R C Bhargava, seen as instrumental in Khattar’s selection and currently the non-executive chairman of the company, told TOI. “We were looking for somebody who could be groomed to be my successor, and he had an excellent reputation as an IAS officer. I enquired from various officers, and the majority of opinion was in favour of Jagdish,” Bhargava said. “It was brave of him to join. Nobody then knew what the future of Maruti was, and very few people expected the company to survive.” Khattar, who was building up Maruti at a frenetic pace, also had to do a sensitive balancing act between Maruti’s two owners — the Indian government and Suzuki — in view of certain tensions that saw government-favourite R S S L N Bhaskarudu preceding him as the MD. In 1999, as the A B Vajpayee government came in, Khattar got his chance and he was the unanimous choice for spearheading Maruti, pleasing the government and, importantly, Suzuki owner Osamu Suzuki. Khattar not only built scale and size, but also led a successful IPO for the company in 2003 even though it did not have the financial heft at that point of time and was doubted by many naysayers. And, he also groomed many future leaders of the auto industry. Nearly every leader at many auto companies today had worked under Khattar and taken leadership lessons from him — be it current MD of Nissan Rakesh Srivastava, Volvo Car India MD Jyoti Malhotra, Hyundai India director Tarun Garg, former GM president Arvind Saxena, or former Honda sales & marketing VP Jnaneswar Sen. “He had a great connect with the ground realities and had a hands-on leadership. I remember how he used to spend days in the field to even scout for good dealers, despite being the MD,” Sen, now retired, said. Khattar would often say that it is not only important to grow step-by-step, but also have the pace and innovative spirit to react fast. This would explain how he would sow the seeds for creation of a research and development department in the company. In its tribute, Maruti called him an “inspiring leader, a successful CEO, a celebrated bureaucrat, a passionate innovator and reformer and a truly people’s man”. Mahindra chairman Anand Mahindra said, “His demise marks the passing of an era. A bureaucrat-CEO-entrepreneur, his was a life of achievement and unceasing exploration. We need more like him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/jagdish-khattar-built-scale-ground-connect-in-maruti/articleshow/82264940.cms||Pankaj Doval

Posted in Narela police station, Shankar tested Covid-positive in January and had already donated his plasma thrice since. According to his senior officers, Shankar has also donated blood 39 times. “Shankar and two other cops, Ravinder Dhariwal and Amit Phogat, run a blood donation group for poor. Dhariwal has donated blood around 62 times till now,” an official said. Two cops, Vijay and Chetan, took responsibility to perform last rites of a 87-year-old Rohini woman who passed away and there was no male member in her family. In the case of a security guard who passed away on April 24, the cops traced his daughter, who had brought him at the hospital and left without giving any details. She didn’t have any money for the treatment, so ASI Satyadev and others helped in the cremation. When a 55-year-old blind man died in Jamia Nagar, ASI Ramesh Chand and others took him to Sarai Kale Khan crematorium and did the last rites. SHO Jamia Nagar, KP Malik, food packets to scores of poor from the area. IBS Hospital in Lajpat Nagar was running out of oxygen when cops arranged for 25 cylinders and saved the lives of 80 patients.

Additional director general (law and order) Amit Kumar issued an order asking the SSPs and SPs to ensure that the guidelines are not flouted at functions being organised by people. A similar instruction was issued on April 18 after assessment of the situation arising out of Covid pandemic. As per April 18 restrictions, not more than 100 people were allowed to assemble at a marriage ceremony and 50 people on the occasion of cremation or burial of the deceased. “Those found to be violating the guidelines were to be penalized by the authorities concerned,” the directive said. The ADG’s fresh letter further directed the SSPs and SPs to ensure proper arrangements of mask and sanitiser and maintenance of social distancing norms at such functions with the help of respective station house officers (SHOs) under their jurisdiction. Sources said the guidelines were thrown to the wind and people in large numbers used to assemble at such functions. On Sunday, an FIR was lodged against former JD(U) MLA Munna Shukla and some unknown people for organising a cultural show in Vaishali district on Saturday night. The police swung into action when a video showing a woman dancer’s performance and a big crowd went viral on the social media. “Such reports are pouring in from different parts of the state,” a senior IPS officer said. Altogether 72,432 people have been booked and a penalty of Rs 36 lakh realised from them for not wearing face masks in the state from April 1 to April 19. In addition, 43 people were arrested, 28 FIRs registered, 1,37,590 vehicles seized and Rs 2.86 crore fine imposed on them for violating Covid norms during the period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ssps-sps-asked-to-crack-down-on-those-violating-covid-norms/articleshow/82263366.cms||Ramashankar

The Bihar assembly control room will also be linked with the medical officer and paramedical staff of the House to provide consultancy services and advice to them. Meanwhile, Sinha appealed to all the concerned and people at large to fight unitedly against the Covid-19 infection in its second wave, as it can only be combatted on a war footing. He also said people should follow the necessary protocol – like wearing masks, using sanitisers, regular washing of hands with soap and maintenance of two metres of distance. He also asked them to observe Covid appropriate behaviour, like avoiding crowded places and refraining from venturing out of their houses unnecessarily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/control-room-set-up-to-advise-mlas-on-covid/articleshow/82263354.cms||Abhay Singh

This exercise has been going on for quite some time now.Ramakant Patil, the president of the Private Hospital Owners’ Association, said: “We have a WhatsApp group of 222 private doctors. This group is coming in handy during the current oxygen crisis. Many patients are on oxygen support and doctors are spending most of their energy in search of oxygen.” Patil said doctors who are in need of oxygen put up a request on the WhatsApp group. “Other doctors, especially those at hospitals where the consumption of medical oxygen is low — if they feel they can make do for the next two-three days even if they gave away a few oxygen cylinders — come to the aid of the doctors who made the original request,” he said.Patil said such sharing and returning of oxygen cylinders has been underway through the WhatsApp group as for the doctors, the health of the patients admitted to their respective hospitals is of paramount importance. The doctors are doing all they can for the patients. Other doctors added that the district administration and the state government are making an effort to procure oxygen from other parts of the state and the country. Though they expected the Oxygen Express to help the hospitals to some extent, the volume of the oxygen that came on the train was not adequate. Nashik gets a supply of approximately 90 metric tonne of medical oxygen, whereas the daily need is 103 metric tonne.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-pvt-docs-help-each-other-find-o-for-patients/articleshow/82245832.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Ordering food from outside is not the best choice since doctors are advising healthy, home-cooked food to every patient since the digestive system needs help too. In such a scenario, high-rises are rallying behind affected families by bringing together willing residents who are volunteering to cook and serve those in distress. In many housing complexes, doubling up one’s own kitchen as a community kitchen with other like-minded residents has become a matter of pride for many. Residents’ committees say that instead of setting up one big kitchen with hired people running it, the present arrangement is better and healthier. At South City Residency, there are several families that are providing meals four times a day, complete with fruits to families affected by Covid. “We have an app through which all affected families are manned. They are being offered meal support by the volunteer families. The latter have divided themselves into groups so that the responsibility can be shared,” shared Manoj Gupta, president of the residents’ association. “Shivangi Kohli Roy was the first one to float the idea, that she can run a kitchen for affected families of Udita who cannot cook. She showed us the way,” said D Nath, president of Udita complex. Similar stories were repeated at Urbana, Silver Spring, Siddha Pines and many other complexes. “There are four to five groups that are running similar kitchens to help 15-20 affected families. Right from breakfast to dinner, we are sending everything to them,” said Prakash Kedia, a resident of Silver Spring. With 23 active cases across nine families at Siddha Pines, many residents have come forward to form groups and have divided the responsibility among themselves so that meals reach the affected families on time. “We have identified space for a bigger kitchen and might hire help who will be supervised by the resident volunteers if the number of cases rises,” said Manav Mehera, president of the complex.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/complex-residents-cook-supply-food-to-cov-affected-families/articleshow/82263826.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The Indian Oil Corporation has also come forward to fund for installing another oxygen plant at the SPG divisional hospital. Amidst accumulating numbers of Covid-19 positive cases and increasing challenges of arranging beds with oxygen supply, high flow nasal cannula, ventilators and life saving drugs for Covid patients, TOI tried to take stock of the preparations on Monday. The divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said, “The foundation on which new oxygen plant of 600 liter per minute capacity is going to be installed has been laid and other basic construction work for it has also been done at DDU district hospital following the arrival of equipment. The process of equipment installation will be started by Tuesday morning.” A private hospital in Mahmoorganj area has also started the process of installing oxygen plant of 400 LPM, he said adding, that the IOC has come forward to extend financial help in establishing 600 LPM oxygen plant at SPG divisional hospital and work on it will also be started soon. Focus on producing oxygen by installing plants in hospitals has been shifted after streamlining the transportation of liquid oxygen for the plants in Ramnagar, which are supplying it to the Covid facilities and needy patients. Agrawal said that as the gap between demand and supply of oxygen has been minimized, the officials are now trying their best to increase the number of beds in Covid facilities and also allow private hospitals to start Covid facilities. He said that the efforts made by the officials so far has helped in increasing the number of beds in Covid facilities, including of ICUs and with ventilators facilities up to 2,000. Major boost in the figures of beds at Covid facilities will become evident when temporary hospital exclusively for Covid patients will come up in German hangers at Amphitheater ground of BHU by DRDO by May 2, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/installation-of-oxygen-plants-begins-at-ddu-a-pvt-hosp/articleshow/82263765.cms||---
---||Business||India has room for large asset rejig co||Mumbai: A study of asset reconstruction companies (ARCs), published by the RBI, has said that there is scope for entry of a well-capitalised and well-designed entity in the Indian ARC industry. Additionally, this would strengthen the resolution of bad loans in the industry. The study notes that the Indian ARC structure is different from other countries that experimented with a public sector model of asset management companies marked by their existence for a pre-defined period following banking crises. The Indian ARC industry has not done well in terms of bringing in capital or recovering bad loans quickly. According to the central bank’s report, Indian ARCs have relied primarily on domestic sources of capital, particularly banks and have relied heavily on bank borrowing. As banks were shareholders, lenders as well as sellers to ARCs, there was a need to monitor whether there was a circuitous movement of funds between banks and these institutions. The report further notes that 42% of the security receipts issued by the ARCs (which are against bad loans) are more than five years old, which means that they would have to be redeemed over the next four years or written off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-has-room-for-large-asset-rejig-co/articleshow/82265004.cms||---

After the first dose, the second dose needs to be taken between four and eight weeks as per Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines in order to achieve an immunity of around 71%. Over 9,000 eligible beneficiaries are due for their second dose. The KMC has decided to fully immunise the citizens who have received their first dose. Amol Mane, vaccination officer of the KMC, said, “Many people were complaining that they are not able to get the second jab as rush at vaccination centres has increased in recent weeks. We have therefore decided to vaccinate such citizens only for the next few days and thereafter resume the first dose vaccination based on the availability of the vaccine.” Despite restricting vaccination only for second dose huge rush was observed at few centres in the city. The KMC had even appealed to the citizens that only those who have registered themselves on CoWIN app will be given priority, still many came to the centres without registration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kmc-starts-giving-2nd-vaccine-jabs/articleshow/82264606.cms||---

He served in the Indian Air Force for 30 long years and took premature retirement in 1996. A very confident ex-serviceman walked into 7 Air Force Hospital, Cantt for admission for treatment of Covid-19 as his oxygen level was dipping. But he was refused admission there. His son then took him to six more hospitals but all of them denied admission stating crisis of bed. A fatigued son then brought his father back home and started treatment. The Air Warrior was provided with oxygen supply at home and the fight to survival started. But the next day, on April 24 at 4 in the morning, he succumbed to coronavirus, leaving his family members devastated. But before that, he documented all what happened with him in a post on Facebook on April 23 at 11:19pm. He was disturbed with the fact that he, despite serving the Air Force, was denied a hospital bed. “Dear MD #ECHS , I am Wg Cdr (wing Commander) RS Bajpai (Rtd). I am put up 30 glorious years in IAF and now I am 79 years old Air Warrior. Today I have seen a post shared by a Colonel to ESM no Covid19 suffering from the disease will treated by all the near by military Hospitals at no point of time they will not be refused for admission/treatment, unfortunately I got a bitter experience today, when I reached 7 Airforce Hospital with 68 oxygen level and breathing issues. All forms and other formalities were done but to my surprise the medical duty officer refused to take admission,” Wing Commander Rama Shankar Bajpai wrote on his Facebook wall on April 23. He further wrote, “He advised to go to empanelled hospitals for admission. On our request to help us in getting admission in any empanelled hospitals he said it was not his duty. We have visited 5 to 6 hospitals but they refused admission due to bed and oxygen crisis. We have to come back leaving my life to the grace of God, who can only save me. This is for your information that how ESM’s (ex-service men) are treated in military hospitals.” His son Shalabh, while talking to TOI, said, “We were confident of getting a bed in the 7 Air Force Hospital but it came as a shock to us when we were denied the facility. Hoping that I would be able to get my father admitted in some other hospital, I visited there still could not help him secure a bed. All of them said that there was bed crisis. All this happened on April 23 and next day he breathed his last at 4 in the morning.” Shalabh said that his father was in Air Force where he served for 30 years and took premature retirement in 1996. He was Wing Commander in the Indian Air Force, said late Rama Shankar’s son.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/former-iaf-man-writes-on-fb-about-covid-bed-denial-dies-next-day/articleshow/82263741.cms||Abhinav Malhotra

While the city reported 1,874 new Covid cases on Sunday, a total of 19 new containment zones have also been added to the list of Prayagraj district containment zones. The list has crossed the figure of 200 zones in just eight days. The officials of the health department, police and district administration are taking the help of google maps to find new containment zones, and subsequent sealing these areas thereafter. So far, the district authorities have sealed over 200 mohallas and deployed police forces to maintain strict surveillance. The exercise of sealing city pockets started eight days back. Officials are identifying new containment zones using google maps, and sealing them. A senior health official, however, said the exercise of finding new containment zones through google maps will continue till we manage to contain the disease in the district. Areas with a large number of infected persons will be sealed to contain the Covid-19 infection. There will be door-to-door delivery of essential articles only. Those found violating the Covid protocol will be punished on the spot. In the past eight days, from April 18 to April 25, the number of Covid containment zones in Sangam city has gone up from 14 to 201, setting the alarms bells ringing for health, police and district authorities. The concentration of containment zones seems to be now increasing in Jhunsi (trans-Ganga) and Naini ( trans-Yamuna) pockets. On April 25, a total of 19 containment zones were added to the list and 11 of them were from rural pockets five in trans-Ganga and six in trans- Yamuna areas. Besides, eight urban pockets in Daraganj, Stanley road (New Katra ward), Tagore Town, Bhaghambari housing scheme (Allahapur), Alopibagh (Daraganj), Mohatsimganj (Narayan Singh Nagar ward) and Tikona Park (Kareli) have also been added to the list of containment zones. The local administration has carried out the sealing process in these localities to contain the spread of the virus. On April 18, the joint team of district administration, police and health department had for the first time identified 14 containment zones after finding clusters of patients. However, with every passing day, the number of containment zones grew up and now crossed the worrying mark of 200. On April 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24, as many as 14, 51, 29, 25, 22, 20 and 20 new containment zones were added respectively in the list. A senior cop said, “Apart from sanitization, medical and administrative team, no one is allowed to move and residents have been strictly asked to stay in their respective homes”. He added that shops selling essential commodities are open and delivery of articles is being done door to door. Wearing a mask has been made mandatory. Densely populated pockets like Dariyabad, Attarsuiya, Govindpur, Allahapur, Sohbatiyabagh, University area (Katra), Khuldabad, Himmatganj, Allenganj, BaiKa Bagh (Kydganj), GTB Nagar, Rajruppur, Preetam Nagar, Kalindipuram, Mundera, Jhalwa, Malviya Nagar, Mutthiganj, Maulvi Nagar, Teliyarganj, Shivkuti, Phaphamau and Naini have reported the maximum number of Covid cases. Officials said that the number of Covid cases started rising rapidly in the first week of this month and authorities tried to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus infection by creating sealed zones in the third week around mohalla and buildings where the maximum number of Covid cases were reported. A containment zone is unsealed 14 days after the last Covid positive case is detected there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/containment-zones-cross-200-mark-in-sangam-city/articleshow/82263821.cms||---

We can commission a 1,700 tonnes per day oxygen plant at a cost of only Rs 90 crore in 10 days at Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (RINL). The manpower is also available locally. The plant was installed at VSP at a cost of Rs 2,000 crore by a French company Air Liquide,” the letter states. “The oxygen plant has not been commissioned even after nearly 10 years since the day of installation as the final payment of Rs 90 crore was not paid. Currently, the VSP is fighting an arbitration case against the French firm in the commercial court, Visakhapatnam. If we clear the dues immediately, the Rs 2,000 crore asset, now worth much more, can give us 1,700 tonnes per day oxygen and greatly enhance our productivity. In the current medical emergency throughout the nation, the steel plant made us proud by supplying oxygen for the roll on-roll train headed to Maharashtra,” the letter goes on to state. The letter to the Prime Minister states that the plant has not been commissioned even after nearly 10 years since its installation as the final payment was not made||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/commission-1-7k-tonne-oxygen-plant-at-vsp/articleshow/82263530.cms||---

In a tragic incident in Tamaram village in Makavarapalem of Visakhapatnam district, an elderly man suffered a heart attack and died within hours after he came to know that his son had succumbed to Covid-19. According to family members, the son Mullapudi Rajarao had been working as a government teacher in Tamaram village in Makavarapalem mandal. Rajarao tested positive for the virus about a week ago and died while receiving treatment in a private hospital in Vizag city on Sunday. After coming to know about his son’s death, Subbarao suffered a heart attack and died on Sunday night. Subbarao had also worked as a government teacher before his retirement several years ago. A pall of gloom descended on the village with the sudden death of two members of a family, hours apart, even as the rest of the family was busy making arrangements for the wedding of Rajarao’s son, who is a software engineer. The wedding was scheduled to be held in Rajahmundry in East Godavari district on May 13. Recently, the family had been shopping in Vizag city before Rajarao developed fever and other symptoms of Covid-19.

Even those who can cure themselves by staying in isolation at home are unnecessarily making a beeline for hospitals, creating chaos in society, said Janata Dal (U) functionary and Patna University geology teacher Ranbir Nandan on Monday. Nandan was addressing a webinar on “Health education for all” organised by the Third World Study Centre, a group of intellectuals in the state capital, as the chief guest. "Most people are not aware of basic things such as injecting a medicine, measuring blood pressure or blood sugar, and using an oxygen cylinder. This is because they have never been made aware of these simple things," he said. Nandan suggested that primary healthcare should be included in the school curriculum. Students should be given practical training in first aid and how to prepare for medical emergencies. "If the people were trained in primary health care practices, the rush at government and private hospitals would considerably subside," he added. Magadh University’s retired chemistry teacher Mahesh Chandra pleaded for a comprehensive health education curriculum. "The curricula must include topics such as emotional health and positive self-image, care of the human body and its vital organs, physical fitness, alcohol, tobacco and drug abuse among others," he said. Patna Science College teacher Anil Kumar introduced the theme of the webinar and thanked the participants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/plea-for-primary-healthcare-education-to-all/articleshow/82263362.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||Facing oxygen shortage, private hospitals forced to discharge Covid patients||PATNA: The worst nightmare of Covid patients and attendants came true on Monday when several hospitals in the state capital started discharging patients citing acute oxygen shortage. Even the government-run IGIMS is struggling to get enough oxygen supply. Senior management official of a private hospital, Samay, in Danapur, Salman Haque told TOI that out of 85 Covid-19 patients in the hospital, they were compelled to discharge 40 patients by Monday afternoon. “We had no other option. We have had no oxygen supply for the past three days, and all efforts to refill the oxygen have been in vain. We tried everywhere but could not get oxygen. Hence, we asked the attendants to arrange for an alternative. We are helpless at the moment,” said Haque, who himself lost his cousin on Sunday evening after failing to avail a ventilator for him. “When I cannot help my own family, what can I do for others at this moment?” he added. The same scene was at Hi-Tech Hospital near Saguna Mor, where several patients were discharged on Sunday night. Here, too, attendants of patients could be seen pleading for help and oxygen. Doctors at the IGIMS also complained of a shortage of oxygen at the hospital. Hospital superintendent Dr Manish Mandal told TOI they were getting the oxygen supply but in small quantities. Dr Manish had said earlier that they had demanded 600 cylinders on Sunday and they received 525. “We already have a deficiency of 75 cylinders since Sunday.” An attendant of an elderly woman admitted to a private hospital in Sheikhpura sobbed while sharing how she was running from pillar to post to shift her mother to another hospital due to lack of oxygen. However, in a statement to the media, state health minister Mangal Pandey said the department was alert on the issue and the district administration was continuously working on supplying oxygen to the government and private hospitals. He further said the refilling of oxygen was also being continuously done under the supervision of district magistrates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/facing-oxygen-shortage-private-hospitals-forced-to-discharge-covid-patients/articleshow/82263305.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Aprajita Krishna, head of the physics department at Patna Women's College (PWC), is one of them. Aparajita and her daughter Kritika Ramya, a professor at a private university, has been providing food to Covid positive patients at their doorsteps free of cost. Aprajita started preparing meals for 100 people a week ago. While she cooks the food, her daughter helps in packing. "I have always been passionate about cooking. It has been therapeutic work for me during this pandemic. I was preparing food for my close family members and relatives who tested positive for Covid and sent it through my driver. But looking at the prevailing scenario, I wanted to help as many people as I could," Aprajita said. She added, "My daughter uses different social media platforms to get in touch with people in need. So far, we have helped people from different places in the state. Several volunteer groups have also approached us for delivering the food packets." Kritika continues her efforts in reaching out to the maximum number of people in need. "The word is still not reaching out to many people for now as many people are not on social media platforms or utilising it in the right way. We are trying our level best to help as many people as possible," she said. Ankit, founder and president of Bihar Chhatra Sansad, said they are delivering food to people, focusing on elderly patients whose children are not staying with them. "We have a chain of volunteers who collect food from different associates and deliver it to places covering all over Patna while maintaining contactless delivery. We are starting this initiative soon at Buxar and Ara as well," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pwc-professor-daughter-help-covid-patients-with-free-home-cooked-meals/articleshow/82263381.cms||---

Railways has put its officials and employees on high alert to take all possible precautionary measures against the deadly virus. ECR GM L C Trivedi on Monday interacted with divisional railway managers (DRMs) of all five divisions, railway union representatives and staff posted in remote places to alert them about the impact of the second wave of the Covid-19. Trivedi asked the DRMs to appoint at least one nodal officer in each division to take care of the needs of railway employees and their family members at these crucial times and provide all possible assistance to them. ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar said the GM asked the 5 DRMs to set up a Covid control helpline number in each division so that aggrieved employees can interact with the nodal officer or official concerned directly about the problems facing them. Besides, the GM stressed on the need to improve required infrastructure in all railway hospitals under the ECR to ensure proper treatment to railway employees and their dependents during their illness, he said. The ECR GM sought cooperation from railway union representatives to ensure that employees and their family members are duly vaccinated against Covid-19. Railways has been carrying on vaccination drive in each railway hospital free of cost for the employees and their dependents, the CPRO said, adding railways would provide bed to each ailing staff in the railway hospitals. According to the CPRO, Trivedi expressed his concern about short supply of oxygen cylinders at most of the places and asked each division to set up a centralized gas distribution system to provide assistance in emergency to railway hospitals under the ECR in Bihar, Jharkhand and UP. The GM directed each division to visit the houses of all those employees who have tested positive for Covid-19 and provide all help to them at the earliest, the CPRO said. The GM directed the DRMs to convert railway community halls into isolation care centres for the infected employees and their family members so that those with mild symptoms can move to isolation centres under the care of railway doctors and paramedical staff, he said, adding the GM felt that better medical infrastructure in railway hospitals was the need of the hour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ecr-to-raise-covid-fund-for-employees/articleshow/82263331.cms||Kumod Verma

The trust noticed that the hospitals were holding the patients back to make huge claims. After getting reports from inspection officials, Aarogyasri Trust served notices to the hospitals for violation of guidelines. The issue assumes significance with the situation on finding beds for Covid-19 patients in a critical condition becoming a difficult task. While government hospitals across the state are packed with patients, private hospitals are not allotting beds to patients citing full occupancy. The Aarogyasri Trust has constituted teams to conduct inspections in all network hospitals. Sources said the inspection teams found that some hospitals were not discharging the patients to claim bills without attending to new patients. Recently, the Aarogyasri Trust’s technical committee recommended payment of bills on a daily basis to the network hospitals for providing treatment. The committee put a maximum of 14 days of hospitalisation for the recovery of Covid-19 patients. The recommendation was made to release patients as soon as they recovered and admit new patients. Using the clause to its advantage, a few private hospitals allegedly kept many patients for 14 days in the hospital. Some patients were found staying in the hospital for more than nine days even after their recovery. The private hospitals held back the recovered patients citing health issues as it would not only help them make claims but also lessen the burden of treating new patients. Aarogyasri Healthcare Trust CEO Dr A Mallikharjuna directed all network hospitals to immediately discharge patients after their recovery.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Don’t discriminate, handle crisis as family head, says Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Accusing the BJP of lackadaisical response towards Covid-19 crisis, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Monday said the government should shun ‘conceit’ and not differentiate between those undergoing treatment in hospitals and those who have arranged for treatment at home. “The government should handle the crisis like the head of a family. It should not differentiate between a patient undergoing treatment at the hospital and one at home. A patient is a patient. It is the government’s duty to provide oxygen to patients at home. Government should also ensure uniformity in charges for vaccination across the country,” Akhilesh said. The former CM said it was lack of farsightedness, planning and gross mismanagement at the government level that has turned the state into the hotbed of Covid-19 virus. He said there was gross mismatch between the death toll being announced by the government and the last rites being performed at the cremation grounds and graveyards. “Government is fudging the death figures only show that not many people are dying due to the infection,” Akhilesh said. “Contrary to CM’s claims of availability of beds at hospitals, uninterrupted oxygen supply and medicines, BJP MPs and MLAs are threatening to stage sit-ins to protest against scarcity of essentials,” he said. “The state administration has failed to check black marketing. Majority of the helpline numbers issued by government either do not exist or do not respond. The government is trying to cover up its failures while the situation on the ground is getting from bad to worse,” the SP chief said. He said doctors and scientists had warned that the second wave would be more devastating than the first one but the BJP government refused to shun conceit and prepare for it. By the time the government woke up, it was too late. Still the government has learnt no lesson,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-chief-dont-discriminate-handle-crisis-as-family-head/articleshow/82265477.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

Many of them are on the verge of losing their business. Schools without uniforms is unimaginable. However, Covid pandemic has changed the scenario completely. Online classes do not demand uniforms and here is where the loss began for the manufacturers. “Lockdown was imposed last year from March 25. We had made bulk orders for the students as they were supposed to buy uniforms for the next class that was supposed to start from April 1, 2020. With the announcement of lockdown, our business started losing the customers,” said Shekhar Shrivastava, a vendor. As vendors were waiting to see the light of the day after schools were declared open since December 18, 2020. “The entire order that was bought for the 2020-21 was wasted. After schools were declared open, we made fresh orders and now this year the situation is even worse than last year. How to survive in such a situation?” said the vendor. Vendors were banking upon the students of class 9 to 12 but they also did not turn up. “Grim situation could be gauged from the fact that there were over 100 orders daily before this pandemic which has come to 2-3 after schools were declared open in December. Soon, that demand will reduce to zero,” said a vendor without quoting his name. Several sellers are in huge debt. “I have not paid the amount of the uniforms I brought to my shops last year. I do not know how I will be able to survive in such a situation,” said a vendor Sukhbir Singh. While some are struggling to cope with the tragic turn of events, many have used their entrepreneurial skills to diversify their business to keep up with the times. “I have shifted my work towards garment selling,” said a vendor without quoting his name.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/school-uniform-manufacturers-in-poor-state-as-campus-are-shut/articleshow/82263859.cms||Ramendra Singh

More than 78,000 beneficiaries received their shots, way higher than the 10,397 people covered on Sunday and 24,157 on Saturday. The vaccine shortage encountered on some days is mostly due to a scarcity of Covishield doses. But a fresh supply of around one lakh doses and another 8,000 Covaxin doses helped put some speed back into the drive. In fact, the daily coverage was among the highest this month. But Monday’s impressive turnout also meant renewed pressure on the district’s vaccine reserves. Officials said many vaccination sites may be forced to shut if new doses don't come on time on Tuesday. A PMC official said the civic body was left with just 6,500 Covishield doses after its drives on Monday. Pune rural has about 15,522 doses left. A total of 78,668 people were given their jabs on Monday, including senior citizens, healthcare workers and frontline staff. Pune rural had as many as 43,906 recipients. In Pune city, 24,702 people were vaccinated and in Pimpri Chinchwad, the coverage was 10,870. A high number of elderly — nearly 20,000 — also received their follow-up doses on Monday. The vaccination drive for the 60+ age group had started on March 1. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said officials in the region are expecting a fresh batch of vaccines. “We know that the good response on Monday means the vaccination drive on Tuesday is likely to see meagre numbers, due to unavailability of doses. But a fresh stock is likely to arrive on Tuesday." On the inconsistent supply to the region, Deshmukh said officials here have no say in allocation as it comes from the state, which relies on the Centre. Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Hospital Board of India, said many private hospital sites struggled to get enough doses for their drives on Monday. He added that chances of refills on Tuesday are low. "This is turning out to be an unpleasant experience for beneficiaries in the region, especially the elderly," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/more-than-78000-given-jabs-as-vax-shortage-looms/articleshow/82264630.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The tests per million in the district is much higher than the average for the state. According to the state health department data of April 23 evening, the number of tests per million for Ludhiana district was 2,353. The data of tests per million for various districts of the state on April 23, suggests that Ludhiana was at fourth position in Punjab. At 3,719, SAS Nagar was at the top and Jalandhar was at number two spot with 2,576 per million. Pathankot was at third position with 2,381 tests per million population. Moga had lowest, 575 tests per million. As the recent bulletin suggests, tests per million was 2,353 on April 23, it is around double the number of tests per million when compared with April 13 when Ludhiana stood at 1,193 on the seven-day average scale. Meanwhile, the previous available data, suggests that the number of tests per million has increased from 1,201 on March 31 to 1,250 on April 9 but fell to 1,193 on April 13 and then risen to current value. The data of April 23 suggests that Ludhiana is among the top contenders so far as the average positivity rate (in seven days before April 23) is concerned as it has such rate at more than 10.1%. SAS Nagar has highest positivity rate in the state at 22.3% whereas Bathinda and Fazilka were at second and third spot with such rate at 15.7% and 15.4% respectively. SBS Nagar had lowest positivity rate of 3.7% in the state. Health department authorities said that increase in test per million is because they have ramped up tests recently. District epidemiologist Dr Ramesh Bhagat said that they have substantially increased testing in the district and trying to do maximum tests. Meanwhile, according to the recent report, even as Ludhiana had 2,353 tests per million on April 23 evening, such value for Punjab was 1,684. Also the report suggests that positivity rate in Ludhiana (10.1%) was lower as compared with that of state at 10.2% on April 23. Box 2: When to maintain status quo, when to test more State health department guidelines suggest that in areas where tests per million (TPM) is high whereas positivity is low, the department needs to maintain status quo. In areas where TPM and positivity are high, the department needs to assess reasons for high positivity, develop interventions. In areas where TPM and positivity are low, the department is supposed to increase testing whereas in areas where TPM is low and positivity is high, the department needs to increase testing on priority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/tests-per-million-doubled-in-district-placing-ludh-on-4th-spot-in-pb/articleshow/82263865.cms||Shariq Majeed

The PMC will give priority to the citizens who have got the first dose. Other people on the priority list will be senior citizens,” Mohol said, adding that the vaccines would be utilised in the civic-run centres. Private hospitals should explore the option of purchasing them from the open market. Leader of the house in PMC Ganesh Bidkar said remdesivir should be made available to the civic body. “The PMC is ready to pay for these injections and give it to the patients,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-to-not-give-shots-to-pvt-hosps-from-may-1/articleshow/82264646.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Judgment in 'rape' case against Tejpal likely today||PANAJI: A local court hearing the eight-year-old alleged rape case against Tehelka founder-editor Tarun Tejpal is likely to pronounce the judgment on Tuesday. Speaking to TOI, special public prosecutor Francisco Tavora confirmed that the order would be pronounced on April 27. The court had posted the matter for order on March 22. The alleged incident had seen many twists and turns. On November 7 and 8, 2013, Tejpal allegedly sexually assaulted a woman at an event organised by Tehelka at a starred hotel in North Goa. On November 22, police lodged a suo motu first information report (FIR) against Tejpal. He turned up in Goa on November 28, 2013 and was arrested on November 30 after his anticipatory bail plea was rejected. He was granted interim bail on May 19, 2014 to attend the cremation of his mother and since then, had been out of jail. In July 2014, Tejpal was granted bail. In September 2017, a Mapusa court framed charges against Tejpal for allegedly raping a junior colleague in November 2013. Tejpal had pleaded not guilty, paving the way for a trial. The cross-examination of the survivor began on October 21, 2019. Earlier, Tejpal had, through a criminal revision application, challenged the framing of charges by the additional district and sessions court. On December 20, 2017, the high court had dismissed Tejpal’s application.

The administration has taken control over the distribution of remdesivir as the rush of patients and their relatives at medical stores has led to shortage.Meanwhile, the IMA, Nashik, has appealed to the Covid-19 patients and their relatives to not panic over the short supply or availability of the injection as it is not a life-saving drug and can be useful only if it is administered from the second to the ninth day of the infection.According to a statement issued by district collector Suraj Mandhare, the IMA had formed a task force and expressed concern over the panic among people about the short supply of remdesivir. Mandhare said the misconception that the injection is a life-saving drug needs to be removed from people’s minds, owing to which it is unnecessarily creating pressure on patients, relatives and doctors. If remdesivir is administered between the second and ninth day of the infection, it reduces the stay of the patient in hospital by only two days. The patient’s life can be saved even without administering the injection. It cannot be administered to patients who are in home isolation because it has to be done under medical supervision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/website-launched-for-privatehospitals-to-seek-remdesivir/articleshow/82262634.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Nashik||CM’s help sought to address Nashik remdesivir shortage||Nashik: District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal called up chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday, seeking his intervention in ramping up remdesivir supplies to Nashik district. In a statement, Bhujbal said the CM has promised to enhance the quota of remdesivir for Nashik immediately. “I told CM that I had spoken to FDA commissioner Parimal Singh a few days back on this matter. Unfortunately, no steps were taken to augment the drug’s supply to Nashik,” said Bhujbal. According to him, although Nashik’s daily remdesivir requirement is around 10,000 vials, it has been getting only about 450 vials every day. “On the other hand, districts like Thane, Pune, Ahmednagar etc. are getting four times of Nashik’s supply. Despite Nashik having a high number of active cases, the supply is inadequate here. This is injustice,” he said. The NCP veteran added that the distributors in Nashik are also supplying remdesivir to neighbouring Ahmednagar and Dhule districts. “Therefore, the share that these two districts get is also shown as the quota for Nashik. But in reality, Nashik is getting much lower stocks,” said Bhujbal. There is an acute crisis of remdesivir in Nashik. The district administration recently appointed a nodal officer to coordinate with the hospitals for their remdesivir requirements. District collector Suraj Mandhare has also appealed to doctors to use the drug judiciously.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/cms-help-sought-to-address-nashik-remdesivir-shortage/articleshow/82262624.cms||---

---||Kolkata||New Town markets to go plastic-free||Kolkata: The New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) from Monday started its pilot project to make New Town markets plastic-free. The pilot project has been taken up in CB Block market in the township. NKDA chairman Debashis Sen said that this is a first of its kind project conceived and to be executed by NKDA to turn the market into a complete plastic free zone in next two years. As per plans, the neighbouring blocks will be given a pair of free cloth bags and every family of the 2,500 odd households in the area will be visited by volunteers every month to see if the bags are being used. Bio-degradable plastic packets will be used by the residents to shop non-vegetarian items. Some kiosks will be set up in New Town temporarily for selling such cloth bags to the residents and shopkeepers of CB market for the next three months. Officials said that those who will forget to bring the cloth bags for shopping will be asked by the volunteers to buy a cloth bag from a designated store before they can start shopping. Those who will follow the rules will be rewarded as the authorities will be putting up their pictures on a “wall of fame” at the entrance to the market. Two NGOs including the Kolkata Society for Cultural Heritage (KSCH) will assist NKDA and work under the guidance of a team of NKDA officials in implementation of the project. Officials said that security personnel on duty at the market gates will look into enforcing rules. Decomposable plastics will be made available for meat and fish sellers at subsidized prices for 18 months and the last six months will be used to ensure a sustainable behaviour from all concerned including suppliers, shopkeepers and residents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-town-markets-to-go-plastic-free/articleshow/82263874.cms||Suman Chakraborti

She came forward to render her services voluntarily following a shortage of microbiologists at the lab. “The staff at the Bytco hospital lab had tested Covid positive. When I came to know that the NMC was facing a staff crunch, I approached the in-charge of the RT-PCR lab and offered my services,” said Bhavsar. She has been doing more than eight-hour shifts at the lab. In the morning, she finishes her online lecture at the college — for an hour from 10.30 am. She then works at the lab from 12 noon till 8pm to 9 pm. Bhavsar has been analyzing the swab samples to check if they are positive or negative along with other staff at the lab. Swati said she will continue to serve at the RT-PCR lab until the second wave of the Covid pandemic is over. Bhavsar had graduated from city-based college in 2000 and she completed her PG from Pune University in 2004.

Now, with the 14-day lockdown, there may be hindrances in supply over the next two weeks,” said Sadiq Shaikh, a vegetable vendor in the Panaji municipal market. Besides the vegetable trucks that transport greens from Karnataka to Goa, there are some small-time vendors that transport vegetables by public transport to sell locally. “These hawkers used to keep the vegetable availability abundant and their rates at a minimum. Now, they will face a direct hit to their business and as a result some commodities will be less in quantity leading to price rise,” another vendor said. Even at the horticulture outlets run by the Goa State Horticulture Corporation Ltd (GSHCL), the vendors are not at ease. “Due to the increase in cases, vegetable trucks arrive three to four times a week instead of five — Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays. The quality of onions and potatoes is also not up to the mark,” said Rose Edward Pereira, proprietor of a horticulture outlet in Campal. “We have been taking less quantity of vegetables compared to earlier. This has therefore had an impact on footfalls,” said proprietor of another horticulture outlet, Prasad Harlankar. Horticulture chairman Pravin Zantye, however, assure that the vegetable supply will be normal. “We will request them to grant special permission to allow the vehicles carrying vegetables to be allowed to continue transportation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/karnataka-lockdown-vegetable-vendors-anticipate-shortage-price-rise/articleshow/82265490.cms||Nida Sayed

Ordering food from outside is not the best choice since doctors are advising healthy, home-cooked food to every patient since the digestive system needs help too. In such a scenario, high-rises are rallying behind affected families by bringing together willing residents who are volunteering to cook and serve those in distress. In many housing complexes, doubling up one’s own kitchen as a community kitchen with other like-minded residents has become a matter of pride for many. Residents’ committees say that instead of setting up one big kitchen with hired people running it, the present arrangement is better and healthier. At South City Residency, there are several families that are providing meals four times a day, complete with fruits to families affected by Covid. “We have an app through which all affected families are manned. They are being offered meal support by the volunteer families. The latter have divided themselves into groups so that the responsibility can be shared,” shared Manoj Gupta, president of the residents’ association. “Shivangi Kohli Roy was the first one to float the idea, that she can run a kitchen for affected families of Udita who cannot cook. She showed us the way,” said D Nath, president of Udita complex. Similar stories were repeated at Urbana, Silver Spring, Siddha Pines and many other complexes. “There are four to five groups that are running similar kitchens to help 15-20 affected families. Right from breakfast to dinner, we are sending everything to them,” said Prakash Kedia, a resident of Silver Spring. With 23 active cases across nine families at Siddha Pines, many residents have come forward to form groups and have divided the responsibility among themselves so that meals reach the affected families on time. “We have identified space for a bigger kitchen and might hire help who will be supervised by the resident volunteers if the number of cases rises,” said Manav Mehera, president of the complex.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/complex-residents-cook-supply-food-to-cov-affected-families/articleshow/82263871.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

In a series of tweets, the BJP leader further said that she spoke to chief minister Chouhan on the shortage of oxygen plants and efforts to take over the 300-bed Ram Raja Hospital situated between Jhansi and Orchha, if the hospital management is unwilling to sort out its differences. "Chief minister gave me a meaningful reply, saying he has given exemption to all the district collectors in the state to utilise funds from the government-funded programmes or MLA fund to set up an oxygen plant. I also spoke to a few district collectors on the matter and I was informed that they are aware of this plan and are moving forward (to execute the same)," said Bharti.

The 70-year-old music maestro had established his music academy, Gurukul, in the Pleasant Valley area of Dehradun. The popular singer had also mesmerised city residents with his renditions through various musical concerts held in Doon. Speaking about his connection with Dehradun, city-based heritage activist Lokesh Ohri said, “He loved Dehradun and despite having a hectic schedule due to singing commitments, he always used to find time to visit the city. His love for Dehradun prompted him to establish his Gurukul named 'Viraam' here in the Pleasant Valley area of the city. The music academy was established around 1999-2000.” Ohri fondly recalled that he first met the maestro in the 90s and since then their relationship had become quite strong. “I got the chance to meet him in 1993-94 when I was involved with SPIC MACAY. In fact, in 2003-04, he designed a very special event in which Rajan-Sajan Mishra performed along with Pandit Birju Maharaj and Pandit Kishan Maharaj. This was a grand event for all classical music lovers and it was an honour for us that it was performed for the first time at our ‘Virasat’ fest in Doon,” Ohri added. The veteran singer last came to Dehradun in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/veteran-classical-singer-rajan-mishra-had-a-strong-uttarakhand-connection/articleshow/82263301.cms||Mohammad Anab

The village head of Shahabpur, Kunda in Pratapgrah district, Prabhakar Singh has shown the same. Singh, 50, has been awarded Nanaji Deshmukh Gaurav Gram Puraskar for being one of the best gram panchayats of state. The award, given virtually by PM Narendra Modi on Saturday, includes a citation and a cash award of Rs 10 lakh. Singh, a postgraduate, was just 24 when he was elected as village head in 1995, had also bagged the Gold medal in 1990 as NCC cadet and has done several path-breaking works and started rainwater harvesting besides working for women empowerment, widow and senior citizen pension and installing solar lights in the village. “In the award ceremony, the PM clicked the button and transferred the award money (as Grant-in-Aid) of Rs 10 lakh to the panchayat’s account under Nanaji Deshmukh Rashtriya Gaurav Gram Sabha Puraskar which was given to 30 gram panchayats across the country, Shahabpur being the only one in UP,” said Singh. Discussing how the money would be spent, Singh said the village head seat has now been reserved for women, so he would propose that one public urinal for women having incinerator should be constructed behind every 10 houses. Besides, a unit for manufacturing sanitary napkins for women should also start in the village. “I will propose that the prize money is used for an ambulance for the village, a garbage collection vehicle, projector in school and setting up a farm equipment bank for farmers,” he said. Singh had also been former block chief (Kunda) and was associated with ‘waterman’ Rajendra Singh as district coordinator district brand ambassador for Ganga Haritima Abhiyan.

Currently, over 100 voters from Karvir tehsil have been moved by the leader of opposition front. A close source said, “The voters have been segregated into batches of 25 and 30, and placed in resorts. The voting is on May 2 and till then the voters need to be safe as every vote counts. We have also started collecting swab samples of every voter and sending them for testing.” The hearing for the petition seeking cancellation of elections for Gokul dairy in Supreme Court has been postponed to Tuesday.

Dullaiya, who was recently praised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his ‘Mann Ki Baat’ for taking Covid vaccine, was perhaps the oldest woman to cast her vote in the Bundelkhand region. Talking to the media, her son Punjab, who carried her to booth no: 105 of the polling station in Veerpura village, said, “My mother had cast her vote for the first time in 1952. Soon after she woke up on Monday morning, she insisted me to take her first to the polling booth. She said that she will start her day with casting a vote.” He said though she is 109-year-old but she is still full of energy and enthusiasm. Dullaiya told the media that she has been a regular voter since 1952 and didn’t want to miss her chance even today. “It’s my humble appeal to all voters to come out with all Covid precautions and cast their votes,” she said. To recall, recently Modi had praised Dullaiya, who is probably the oldest in the country to take Covid vaccine. The Prime Minister had said that her vaccination should motivate others to come forward and participate in the drive against Covid 19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/109-year-old-woman-casts-vote-in-panchayat-poll/articleshow/82263750.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Allahabad||Over 3.30L receive vaccine shots in dist||Prayagraj: As many as 3,30,085 Covid vaccine shots were administered to beneficiaries above 45 years at 97 sites in the district till April 25. While 2,59,249 beneficiaries had taken up the first dose of vaccine, a total of 71,836 recipients had also received the second dose of vaccine. However, the district authorities are waiting for the guidelines for vaccination drives where people above 18 years will be vaccinated. Officials of the district health department pointed out that around 60 percent of the population of the district between 18-45 years will be covered once the vaccination above 18 years get started. Additional chief medical officer and district immunization officer, Dr. Teerath Lal told TOI that over 3.30 lakh vaccine shots were administered to recipients till Sunday. “Over 2.59 lakh recipients received the first dose while 71,836 recipients had their second shot in the district. More and more beneficiaries are turning up at Covid vaccination centres to receive the jab,” he said. Dr Lal, meanwhile, said the department is waiting for the guidelines for the special campaign starting from May 1, where people above 18 years will be eligible to take vaccine shot as per the protocol of the union government. As about 60 percent of district population falls in this age category, we will have to increase the vaccination centres and create a database of people in the target age group. However, getting registered on the CoWIN web portal and taking an appointment to get a Covid-19 vaccine jab will be mandatory for those aged between 18-45 years as walk-ins will not be allowed initially, said the sources adding those above 45 years can still avail the facility of on-site registration to get vaccinated. “An increased demand is expected once the vaccination is opened for all. And, for better management and control, registering on CoWIN portal and taking prior appointment to get the shot will be mandatory for those aged between 18-45 years. Walk-ins will not be allowed in the beginning in order to avoid chaos,” an official said. With the surge in Covid cases in Prayagraj district, eligible recipients are turning to Covid vaccination centers to get the shots. However, recipients from urban pockets are turning more at vaccination centres as compared to rural based Community Health Centres. The state government had already decided to administer Covid-19 vaccine free of cost to all those above 18 years from Saturday. The union government’s decision (to open vaccination for 18+) will undoubtedly help in better management of Covid and massive vaccination will help in defeating coronavirus. Currently, the state health authorities are busy in drafting an action plan to conduct the vaccination campaign on a large scale from May 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/over-3-30l-receive-vaccine-shots-in-dist/articleshow/82263847.cms||---

After the outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020, Ola’s electric division took back the cars and parked them at a rented premises off Amravati Road. “Since then, we have been requesting the company to at least allow us to ferry passengers like our diesel-petrol cab counterparts. But we are not being allowed to do that,” said one of the e-taxi drivers. These e-cabs have been registered in Ola’s name. TOI tried to contact Ola officials but none of them responded. Due to the pandemic, the app-based aggregator stalled its operations in March 2020. A delegation met Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari and collector Ravindra Thakare but it was all in vain, a group of e-cab drivers told TOI. One driver claimed to have paid over Rs 9 lakh to Ola Electric Technologies. “I was driving the Ola electric car since the service was launched in Nagpur in May 2017. Since then drivers who were paying Rs 1,000 rent per day had been struggling to make ends meet. I paid over Rs 9 lakh from June 2017 to March 2020. Later, they stalled the service by withdrawing the entire e-cab fleet and parked it at Shriram Yard off Amravati Road,” she claimed. In 2017, Ola Electric Technologies launched its first-ever electric-powered transport ecosystem in Nagpur by investing Rs 50 crore. At the launch of the service which was inaugurated by Union minister Gadkari, Ola Electric Technologies announced that it would operate 200 e-vehicles in the city. Information from the regional transport office, Nagpur city, revealed that Ola had obtained taxi permission (registered in the names of Ola Fleet Technologies Pvt Ltd) for 90 electric vehicles for a period of five years, from May 2017 to May 2022. Drivers claimed the e-cabs got a good response in the city. “Commuters were preferring e-cabs over autorickhaws,” they said. TOI spoke to a few regular users who said that charges of e-cabs were much less compared to autorickshaws. Though Ola is not divulging the present status, sources from the company’s city office told TOI that it was to resume the service after Diwali last year, but deferred it till March, which was again extended due to the spike in Covid cases. Drivers fear that the cabs may develop a technical snag as they have been stationary since more than a year. The drivers want the company to handover the vehicles so that they can resume the e-cab service. “We will continue to adhere to all the Covid protocols like using wearing a face mask, keeping sanitizers and disinfecting vehicles after every trip,” they said. Many e-cab drivers have started working in grocery shops. Some have even started selling vegetables by the roadside. Many are still living in the hope that they will get back their e-cabs to resume the service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ola-grounds-e-cab-fleet-since-1yr-drivers-struggle-to-earn-livelihood/articleshow/82264731.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Senior office-bearers of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Nashik, on Monday met district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal to raise the issue. “There are over 150 private Covid hospitals in the city, which gets a daily supply of 80 to 85 metric tonne of oxygen. Private hospitals get 50-60%. However, the available stock of oxygen is not evenly distributed among the private hospitals,” said IMA Nashik president Hemant Sonanis. He said that although there are about 10 oxygen retailers, just a couple of them are controlling the supply and providing the gas to a few hospitals, leaving the other facilities in the lurch. The IMA delegation said the oxygen available for private hospitals must be evenly distributed. Sonanis said that due to the shortage of oxygen supply in many private hospitals, they have to spend most of their time searching for it. The problem is being experienced for quite some time and the private doctors have had a series of meetings with senior officials of the district administration. “Bhujbal said he would look into the issue at the earliest and resolve it so that there is an even supply of medical oxygen,” said Sonanis.Former presidents of IMA, Nashik, Prashant Devre and Aniruddha Bhandarkar were present in the meeting with Bhujbal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ima-cries-foul-as-nashik-private-hospitals-face-oxygen-shortage-uneven-distribution/articleshow/82262666.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Goa||Karnataka lockdown: Beef traders say supply will not be affected||PANAJI: The 14-day statewide lock-down in Karnataka which will be imposed from Tuesday night has left the meat traders in Goa apprehensive. While chicken vendors in Goa can source stocks from Maharashtra, meat traders in the sate are solely dependent on Karnataka for beef. “We have spoken to our suppliers in Belagavi and they have assured us that till the time they have cattle available with them, they will continue to supply beef to Goa,” said Anwar Bepari, general secretary of the Quraishi meat traders association. “We will have beef supply in the state till there is stock. So far they have assured us that essential services from Karnataka will not be hindered to supply to Goa,” he added. Chicken vendors were more at ease as they can rely on Maharashtra for their requirements. Alfredo Dias, a chicken and egg seller from Panaji market said that he has been sourcing chicken from the border areas of Goa and Maharashtra to ensure that the supply is not affected. “After the recent incidents of bird flu (avian influenza), we decided to source birds from Mahrashtra instead of Karnataka. Our chicken supply will not be affected in most of north Goa. However vendors in south Goa may be affected if essential supplies to the state are stopped,” Rixon Fernandes a vendor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/karnataka-lockdown-beef-traders-say-supply-will-not-be-affected/articleshow/82265536.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||HC dismisses Jalna lawyer’s plea to quash rape FIR claiming ‘marriage’ with complainant||Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court has dismissed a Jalna lawyer’s petition for the quashing an FIR of rape, cheating and other charges claiming that he and the complainant-woman were now “husband and wife”, have a girl child and, as per two Supreme Court rulings, there was no rape committed by him. The woman too had supported the lawyer’s petition, claiming that she never wanted a rape case and the investigating officer (IO) himself registered such a case. The HC, however, observed that the first marriages of the lawyer as well as the woman were in subsistence and their claim of second marriage can neither be legally recognized nor can they claim the benefit of the two Supreme Court rulings as those cases were on a different footing. “We find that the stand taken by the petitioner herein, along with the informant (woman), is only for self-serving purposes and this case, therefore, assumes the character of being a case of apparent abuse of the process of law,” the bench of justices BU Debadwar and Ravindra V Ghuge said. The lawyer was earlier representing the woman before a Family Court in Jalna in a divorce petition she filed against her husband. According to the FIR lodged on October 11, 2020 with the Jalna taluka police station, the two developed friendship and the lawyer told her that he too was divorcing his wife. He convinced the woman to start living with him along with her son from the first marriage. The woman then alleged that between January 4 and 29 last year, the lawyer kept her illegally confined, ravished her and refused to marry her when she became pregnant. He started beating her regularly, kept her and her son confined in a tin shed, raped her and beat them, the FIR stated. The bench referred to the two affidavits she had filed and said, “It is quite intriguing that the informant now makes an allegation against the IO that she had never intended to register a case u/s 376 (rape) of the IPC and that the IO himself has registered such an offence.” The HC cited submissions by lawyers on the marital status of the petitioner and the woman and said, “Neither the petitioner nor the informant have legally separated from their respective wife and husband. Both of them have not obtained a divorce decree from the competent court, so as to legally marry each other. In these circumstances, we do not find that the view taken by the… Apex Court in… would assist the petitioner,” the HC said. “In the instant case, the petitioner, alleged rapist and the informant, still have subsisting first marriages and, therefore, we cannot recognize the alleged second marriage between the petitioner and the informant. We find it quite serious that the petitioner being an advocate and representing the informant in her divorce petition proceedings, claims that the informant is his legally wedded second wife. We find this to be unacceptable in law,” the bench added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-dismisses-jalna-lawyers-plea-to-quash-rape-fir-claiming-marriage-with-complainant/articleshow/82264734.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Nakul Nath tweeted that in case of increase in patients, no one has to depend on oxygen from the hospitals’ central piping system. Instead, additional patients can be given oxygen through the cylinders. Through the last fortnight, senior Congress leader Kamal Nath arranged and sent another 93 tonne oxygen to the district hospital Covid ward. According to Pankaj Shukla, Chhindwara town Congress president said, “Fifteen days ago, doctors in Chhindwara hospital said that there is dearth of oxygen and stock will last for only two more days. Our leaders spoke to the former chief minister and he said that arrangements have already been made.” The first tanker of 15 tonnes of oxygen arrived within four hours in Chhindwara, Shukla recalled. “Thereafter, every alternate day the oxygen has been coming sometimes ten tonne, then 15 tonne under instructions from the former chief minister and Nakul Nath.” Kamal Nath also sent a batch of 250 Remdesivir injections earlier this month, from which 50 vials were given to the district hospital and the rest distributed to private hospitals. “Hundred more injections came from the former chief minister which we distributed to poor patients. Continuously since then, remdesivir injection are coming from the senior leader in batches of 100 or 50 which are being distributed by our party leaders,” Shukla added. Congress said that government stopped distribution of the injection through private parties. But Kamal Nath still arranged for them through his contacts.

---||Allahabad||Bizman initiates plan to set up oxygen plant to feed 3 hospitals||Prayagraj: At a time when Prayagraj is facing acute shortage of oxygen during the ongoing pandemic, a local businessman has initiated a plan to set up an oxygen plant in the city with a capacity to feed the oxygen requirement of three government hospitals free of cost forever. After a nod from the district magistrate (DM), the project has started taking shape on a 7400-square meter plot in Naini industrial area of the district. The businessman, Umesh Jaiswal, has decided to install the oxygen plant at Naini with the daily production of 1,100 cylinders and has adopted three government hospitals of the city wherein he would provide free of cost supply of oxygen. Jaiswal is into the business of road construction and presently his company is constructing parts of some important national highways connecting Sangam city to different neighbouring districts. “Since I have a separate set of business, I had never thought of setting up an oxygen plant, but while reading about the recent deaths in the district because of shortage of oxygen, I came across the news about the Banaras based industrialist R K Chaudhary installing an oxygen plant. That’s when I decided to initiate something of this kind for Prayagraj too,” said Jaiswal. “Initially my plan was to set up a small industry but some of my close friends and advisors suggested that if I want to serve the society, the project should be larger,” he added “The next day I spoke to SSP Prayagraj, Sarvashresth Tripathi who helped me meet the Divisional Commissioner Sanjay Goyal who forwarded my proposal the very same day to the concerned authorities. The DM gave his approval and now all the paper formalities have been done and I have given order to a Gujarat-based company for installing the state’s maiden automatic oxygen synthesis plant where both, liquid oxygen and its gaseous form, will be manufactured simultaneously”, he said. This would be second such plant in the country, the first being installed at Godhra by the same company who would be installing this Naini-based plant, informed Jaiswal who belongs to Babuganj, Phulpur. Jaiswal has adopted three government hospitals of the city, namely Beli, Dufferin and Colvin hospital, and would be giving free oxygen to them, lifelong. The plant, being constructed at a cost of Rs 14 crores would be spread in an area of over 7,400 square meters at sector III of Saraswati Hightech city, Naini and the registry of the land would be done in a couple of days. The industry will produce 1,100 oxygen cylinders per day and if needed, this could go up to 1,500 cylinders per day. The production is expected to start from August, this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/bizman-initiates-plan-to-set-up-oxygen-plant-to-feed-3-hospitals/articleshow/82263872.cms||---

District collector Rajendra Bharud, said the administration has started the Covid vaccination drive on a mission mode to ensure all beneficiaries in the district get vaccinated.“There are unfounded apprehensions among a section of the tribal population about getting vaccinated. The authorities have taken up the onus to educate and convince such beneficiaries about the imperative need to get vaccinated. It is a big challenge for us but we are confident of overcoming it,” said Bharud. The administration has already organised 15 camps in the rural parts of the six talukas. Bharud travelled to some villages and interacted with locals stressing on the need to take the vaccine.“A section of beneficiaries are gullible and uneducated. They have false notions that after taking the vaccine, they will have severe health hazards. It is a painstaking task to convince them but the response in these camps has been encouraging,” said district officials.The administration has deployed 12 vehicles that are going to the remote parts of the six talukas to inoculate the beneficiaries. Initially, a team comprising government teachers visit the villages to register the beneficiaries, then a few days later the vaccination team travels to the village to inoculate the beneficiaries.The district collector has directed the authorities to ensure that by May 15 , 12 lakh beneficiaries above the age of 18 years are registered for the vaccination programme. Then they will be vaccinated in a phased manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nandurbar-district-admin-to-focus-on-vax-drive/articleshow/82262687.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

The oxygen audit project comes two days after chief minister Yogi Adityanath launched a digital platform — Oxygen Monitoring System for UP — for live tracking of oxygen supply in private and government hospitals across the state. The monitoring system will have live information on oxygen status in hospitals in the districts, allotment and loading of oxygen in vehicles, live location of tankers moving on highways and oxygen supply and its utilization.A press communique from IIM-L on Monday said, due to the current Covid crisis, the oxygen audit will track and monitor oxygen use in hospitals, both government and private for ensuring optimal utilisation. Along with IIM-L, IIT-K and IIT-BHU will also be part of the project. Government officials said, the audit will stop oxygen wastage through live tracking of demand and supply at hospitals. “The idea is to provide oxygen rationally so that those in need are not deprived. Hospitals must clarify in case of high oxygen use. We will maintain vigil on supply and use,” said additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Awasthi. Authorities at IIM-L said, a team of professors is currently working on the modalities to be adopted for oxygen audit. Led by Prof Suresh Jakhar, the IIM-L team comprises Prof Arunabha Mukhopadhyay, Prof Ajay Garg and Prof Kshitij Awasthi.

The popular weekly shanty has been happening near the Viralimalai bus stand for over three decades. Traders from other across several districts come to sell and purchase goats. S Zakir Husain, 40 from Tirunelveli came to Viralimalai on Saturday due to the travel restriction on Sunday. “We were expecting the cost to be less in the shanty, but we can make profits only if we sell meat for over Rs 1000 per kg as the cost of goats have shot up,” he said. S Senthil, 40 who has taken a tender for the shanty said there is a steep fall in the number of traders coming with their goats for sales in the last two weeks. Close to 1000 goats used to be traded in the weekly shanty before the Covid-19 outbreak. The numbers halved by the end of last year and it has come down further in the second wave, he said. Saying that uncertainty created by the pandemic has affected the purpose of shanty as farmers rearing goats have started approaching the meat shops directly instead of visiting the shanty as they are getting good rate for the goat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/meat-shanty-gets-less-goats-prices-to-shoot-up/articleshow/82264739.cms||---

Most people were out to buy grocery items and vegetables. The city police maintained a vigil to ensure there were no violations of the Covid-19 norms. Unlike other cities and districts in the state, markets in Nashik city have been observing complete closure on Saturdays and Sundays for more than a month now. Since the markets were closed over the weekend, and since grocery stores and vegetable markets are allowed to operate only between 7 am and 11 am on weekdays, the markets saw considerable rush on Monday. The rush was evident in all marketplaces including Nashik Road, Satpur, Indiranagar, Ambad, Panchavati, College Road, Gangapur Road etc. Suraj Bijali, the senior PI of the Nashik Road police station, said a slightly more than usual crowding was expected on Monday after two days of complete closure. However, the police maintained strict bandobast to make sure that people were wearing masks, maintaining distancing and following other Covid-appropriate behaviour. People have responded positively to the weekend closures. Therefore, the police personnel were seen politely asking people to follow Covid protocol. The police bandobast continued as usual with every police station putting up three checkpoints in their jurisdictions apart from patrolling their respective areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/after-weekend-curbs-rush-in-markets/articleshow/82262745.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The work of setting up these plants will be completed within a month. These plants will be set up at the Nashik civil hospital, the Manmad, Yeola, Kalwan and Chandwad sub-district hospitals and at Sinnar, Pimpalgaon Baswant, Igatpuri and Wani rural hospitals. Civil surgeon Ashok Thorat said they intend to complete the tendering process within a week and after three weeks, the oxygen generation plants should be operational. These plants will not be dependent on liquid oxygen, but would generate oxygen from the air through oxygen concentrators, he said. The dependency on oxygen from other sources will be solved to a greater extent. Meanwhile, in the next phase, all the government hospitals will be equipped with oxygen generation plants. The decision to set up these plants comes on the backdrop of the Bhujbal’s instruction to set up beds with oxygen in all the government hospitals at the taluka level in the district. However, since the availability of oxygen depended on the supply of liquid oxygen from other parts of the state, there has been an acute shortage of medical oxygenThe nine oxygen generation plants in hospitals across the district will produce 860 jumbo cylinders of oxygen per day. This would also save the cost of transportation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/rs-11cr-approved-for-oxygen-generation-plants-in-9-hosps/articleshow/82262713.cms||Santosh Sonawane

To cut the waiting time, the authorities created three stone platforms outside the cremation area but still the number of bodies kept piling up. The already aggrieved relatives’ sorrow found no bounds when they realized that even after the death, the persons – for whom they stood in line for hospital beds to oxygen to medicines – would have to remain in queue to get their last rites done properly. Sources close to the development said that the crematorium is adding one more furnace on war footing for the Covid patients to cut the waiting time and ensure that the proper cremation can be offered for all. “Almost all the crematoriums have waiting of at least two hours. The number of deaths have got manifold in past few days due to the pandemic. It’s not just Covid patients – many directly bring the bodies from their residences where the cause of death is not known. But now there’s no clear demarcation – even those with confirmed Covid history are given wooden logs for the last rites,” said an official associated with the process. “Earlier only gas furnaces were used for the purpose. But they are also overused during the pandemic, requiring quicker replacement of parts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vadaj-crematorium-adding-new-furnace/articleshow/82248500.cms||---

The hotels had modified the seating arrangements in a manner preventing the entry of customers towards the dine-in area. Counters were shifted by blocking the entrance. Supervisors and suppliers who usually cater to the needs of people dining-in at the restaurant were diverted to the kitchen, while a section of workers in the kitchen was asked not to report for work. The hotel workers were given a weekly turn system to report for work and will be paid only half their salary due to the fall in demand. “We have reduced the net quantity of food production by 50%.

The case-count, which was hovering around 21,000 between April 8 and 18, went up to 27,700 in the next seven days.Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the medical superintendent of NMC, said the transmission of the virus is still high in Nashik city, which has led to a rise in the number of active cases. “This virus is more infectious now than it was during the first wave last year. The number of cases added daily has increased in the last week, but the number of recoveries per day is comparatively low. This is the reason why the number of active Covid cases has increased in the city,” said Nagargoje.Between April 8 and 18, the gap between the number of fresh cases reported daily and the number of patients recovering had reduced significantly. Now that gap has again increased. The city, on average, recorded 3,153 daily new cases and 2,225 daily patient recoveries between April 19 and 25. The gap between the daily new cases and recoveries is now over 900.Meanwhile, the total number of Covid patients in the city has reached 1,82,376. Of them, 1,53,097 patients have recovered from the contagion and 1,482 patients have succumbed in the past year.By the first week of February, the city had recorded 99 cases per day on average, but the cases started to increase from the second week of February.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Scarce oxygen, 108 delays leave citizens on brink||AHMEDABAD: Vinod Parmar, a resident of Sola, called the EMRI 108 emergency service on Friday morning. “It was a non-Covid call as my grandmother had started developing age-related complications. We followed-up three or four times, and then gave up,” he recounts. “She was taken to a nearby hospital but could not be saved. Her last rites were performed on Saturday evening. When we were back from the cremation, a 108 executive called asking us whether they could pick her up. We had to tell him she had departed for her destination already,” says Parmar. With the explosion in Covid cases, the emergency service is under stress not felt in its 14-year run. “We are fielding more than 50,000 calls a day, about one call every two seconds. Even if one discounts the follow-up calls, the volume has increased manyfold in the past 20 days. Despite expanding our fleet thrice in the past fortnight, response time has increased,” said a senior official. Similarly, a family in Ghodasar waited for more than 30 hours to get admission to a hospital but eventually the Covid patient succumbed to complications. “We tried to get admission at private and government hospitals, get oxygen and medicines at home, but could not save my father,” said Kantilal Makwana. The acute shortage of oxygen also puts citizens in distress. Harshad Patel, a social worker from Amraiwadi, said that their neighbour, Maya Parmar, 33, a resident of Gandhinagar, succumbed to Covid complications as the family could not arrange for oxygen. “She had come to her parents’ home for the last week. About four days ago, she tested positive. As the family could not get her admitted to a hospital, they started treatment at home. They arranged for one oxygen cylinder, but could not find a replacement. She succumbed on Sunday,” said Patel. Sudha Patel, 63, a resident of Dholka, was among the patients in queue outside Civil Hospital on Monday. Hitesh, her son, said they had to come to the hospital as they could not get oxygen despite their best efforts. “Her oxygen level has dipped to 70%-75% and she needs hospitalization. As we could not get a bed at four hospitals, this is our last hope,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/scarce-oxygen-108-delays-leave-citizens-on-brink/articleshow/82264812.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Nagpur||12 of 18 life insurance claims of frontline workers rejected, no word on others||NAGPUR: Twelve of the 18 death claims by the civic body under the Rs50 lakh Covid cover for health workers in the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package have been rejected. The claims were rejected since ‘Covid was not contracted while handling a patient during the course of work’. Most of these 12 workers who died last year were safai karmacharis (sanitization workers), and one driver. The scheme had been launched during the first Covid wave, and was discontinued last month, with remaining claims to be submitted before April 24. NMC is awaiting a decision on the remaining six claims for at least four months, said sources. Decisions on claims put up by different hospitals in the region are also pending, said sources. NMC sources said last year the sanitization workers were engaged in a host of jobs, ranging from cleaning streets and drainages to being deployed at quarantine centres or even ghats (crematoria). Officials said the workers were practically at the front line, and attended to duties even when the rest of the city was closed during lockdowns. From handling garbage to cleaning NMC hospitals or quarantine centres, they were equally at risk of getting Covid infection during their course of work, stressed an official A renewed claim application with additional papers has been submitted after a subsequent government resolution (GR) further clarified the definition of frontline workers, a source said. Jammu Anand, president of Nagpur Mahanagar Palika Asthayi Arogya Karmachari Sangathan, which also includes sanitation workers, said he would be raising the issue at relevant forums. “These are essential workers and have been working amid people during pandemic, which makes them more vulnerable to Covid,” he said. Of the remaining eight cases, a source said even after repeated correspondence a decision remains awaited. Only after the authorities revert would NMC know if the cases have been cleared or rejected. “Two cases have been sent from our hospital too. A decision on it is awaited,” said a top official at Indira Gandhi Government Medical College (IGGMCH). “None of the cases in Vidarbha have been cleared. This means there is no response, either rejection or confirmation,” said Shardha Waghe, secretary of Maharashtra Staff Nurses Association. Counting the cases, she said there were two nurses from GMCH Nagpur, one each for Amravati, Badnera and Gadchiroli, and two ward boys from IGGMCH. A response is awaited in all the cases. The deaths happened last year. A letter by Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan itself indicates that not many cases throughout the country may have been cleared. The letter informing discontinuation of the insurance cover says 287 cases have been cleared by the insurance company. Meanwhile, another employee at GMCH is reported to have passed away due to Covid, a source said. The case may not qualify for insurance as the death happened after the scheme was discontinued. A new scheme had been promised for these workers, but it has not been notified yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/12-of-18-life-insurance-claims-of-frontline-workers-rejected-no-word-on-others/articleshow/82264804.cms||Shishir Arya

Citing the fall in income due to restricted working hours owing to the night curfew, MSME workers are leaving for other jobs seeking a better income. Tamil Nadu Small and Tiny Industries Association (TANSTIA), an apex body of all MSMEs across the state said there are around 30,000 MSMEs including the tier II units producing components for power generation and distribution firms. From operating three shifts per day, covering 24 hours, the MSMEs that were not exempted from the lockdown has reduced the working hours to a single 8-hour shift each day. Similarly, from employing 50 workers per shift, the MSMEs now employ only 25 persons as per the restrictions. The limited employees and period of operation have reduced the production output by at least 50%. As the workforce was denied an opportunity to work overtime and on Sundays to earn an additional income of around Rs 300 per shift per day. “If automobile industries can be given an exemption to work amid lockdowns, why not us? We are producing components important for electricity generation and transmission,” R Ilango, president, Trichy District Tiny and Small Scale Industries Association (Tiditssia) said. The MSMEs sought the district industries centre (DIC), State MSME department to allow the essential manufacturing units in the districts to function amid the curfew by ensuring the restrictions. “If we fail to deliver the product on deadline, we have to pay a certain sum as delay penalty. Already, the surge in steel price by 60% has destabilised us. Power sector MSMEs need exemptions to operate for the usual duration,” S Vasudevan, joint secretary, TANSTIA said.The power sector MSMEs in Chennai, Trichy, Coimbatore, Ranipet and Ramanathapuram districts are producing electrical substation, transformer and metering panel components for various electricity boards including Tangedco. “The demand raised by MSMEs was genuine, we have taken their request seriously. Senior bureaucrats will discuss and fetch a solution,” a senior official in the MSME department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/power-sector-msmes-seek-exemption-from-lockdown-restrictions/articleshow/82264813.cms||Deepak Karthik

On Wednesday, 22 critical patients — 11 on ventilator support and 11 on oxygen beds — had died at the hospital due to disruption in oxygen supply following a leak in the large tank. The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) had installed a large liquid oxygen tank of 13,000 litre capacity at the Zakir Hussain Hospital and the tank was made operational on March 31, 2021. NMC has a centralized oxygen system at the hospital which has 150 beds for Covid patients — 129 of them with oxygen. This large tank had developed a leakage on Wednesday, disrupting the oxygen supply that led to 22 deaths. A technical team had temporarily repaired the leak and had restored the supply from the tank within an hour of the leak. However, the private company’s team carried out and completed thorough repairs and tests on Saturday night. NMC officials said the private firm’s team replaced the inlet and outlet pipes of the tank. During the repair works, oxygen supply from the large tank was stopped and supply was given from two oxygen tanks brought by the private firm. The oxygen supply from the large tank was resumed after 14 hours on Monday. When contacted, NMC medical superintendent Bapusaheb Nagargoje said the technical team had been in Nashik for three days to carry out the repairs and tests. “The supply of oxygen from the large tank was shut from 11 pm on Sunday till 1.45 pm on Monday. In the meantime, supply of oxygen to patients continued from the additional tanks brought by the private firm,” said Nagargoje. He also said that they are in the process of setting up an additional oxygen tank as a backup for the large oxygen tank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/zakir-hussains-o-tank-repaired-supply-resumes/articleshow/82262777.cms||Tushar Pawar

After counting, the department seized all the cases.”“Though the driver of the vehicle managed to flee from the spot, we have taken into possession his cellphone and a few documents. An FIR has also been registered at Division 6 police station. There is a significant rate difference between liquor being sold in Haryana and Punjab.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ‘52,036 Covid patients on Oxygen support’||AHMEDABAD: The state government on Monday informed the Gujarat high court that as many as 52,036 Covid-19 patients are on oxygen support at present. The government said that it is trying its best to ensure oxygen supply to hospitals and the demand has been increasing with time, with cases increasing by 4-6% every day. It explained that the consumption of medical Oxygen was 58 MT on March 15, but on April 24, it increased up to 1,000MT. As the high court has directed the government to ensure increase in Oxygen supply, the government said that the issue has been taken up by the Centre and it is monitoring and allocating the supply to states. The government said that on April 21, it received 975 MT oxygen as against the requirement of 1,000 MT on that day. There have been requests to increase the state quota, but 1,000 MT was consumed on April 23 against the allocation of 1,000 MT for the day. For proper distribution of oxygen to state hospitals in different districts, the government said that it has set up a task force of two IAS officers. It has been undertaking all efforts to sensitize manufacturers for uninterrupted supply. Out of eight Pressure Swing Absorption (PSA) plants sanctioned by the central government, three have been fully commissioned and four others will be operational soon. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/52036-patients-on-o2-support/articleshow/82264818.cms||---

---||Trichy||Residents take new curbs in their stride||Trichy: More stringent restrictions to contain the raging Covid-19 spread came into effect on Monday, but the first day passed without much confusion in Trichy district. The new restrictions, such as closure of all shopping complexes, big format shops, cinema halls, gyms, recreational clubs, bars, auditoriums and meeting halls reduced the movement of people to a certain extent. Since grocery shops and other essential commodities shops were allowed to function as usual, there was no panic shopping visible. Departmental stores allowed the permitted number of people after sanitising their hands and insisting on wearing face masks. However, the ignorance of people regarding mask etiquette still stood out with many not wearing one while shopping at the local grocery shops. Complexes housing various shops remained opened as some shop owners were sceptical whether their premises came under the shopping complex category and need to be shut according to the latest order. The reduction of business hours in banks from 10 am to 2 pm against the usual time of 4 pm also came into effect on Monday. The new norm resulted in panic withdrawals at several ATMs in the city as people had apprehensions of likely unavailability of cash in ATMs in the days to come. An officer-bearer of All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) from Trichy, J Anantha Padmanabhan, said banks should ensure availability of cash in ATMs. “The cash is replenished in ATMs by outsourced agencies. Banks should ensure it is replenished regularly. Since it is a challenging situation for bank employees, customers should cooperate with us by utilising internet banking,” he said. Tipplers had some inconvenience with the closure of all bars. They had to take away their booze in the time slotted to them in the tokens. On the first Sunday lockdown, Trichy rural police booked seven cases of curfew violations while Trichy city police registered cases against three people for roaming unnecessarily on the road and opening a bakery in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/residents-take-new-curbs-in-their-stride/articleshow/82264816.cms||Gokul Rajendran

A 40-bed facility was first set up in Sagar two days ago, followed by a bigger one in Bhopal on Monday. Covid patients who cannot be isolated at home because they don’t have space or have children and elderly parents, will be admitted here under the care of a dedicated team of Army medics. Oxygen concentrators have been arranged, and ambulances are on standby 24x7. Forty beds have been reserved for women and children. A mobile kitchen will serve breakfast, tea and hot meals.

According to officials, over 50% turnout was recorded till 5pm-- a sharp dip from the earlier two phases which witnessed over 70% voting. Polling was held in Shamli, Meerut, Moradabad, Pilibhit, Kasganj, Firozabad, Auraiya, Kanpur Dehat, Jalaun, Hamirpur, Fatehpur, Unnao, Amethi, Barabanki, Balrampur, Siddharthanagar, Deoria, Chandauli, Mirzapur and Ballia districts. Several districts in western UP witnessed clashes in which two persons died and scores of others were injured. In Pilibhit’s Neuria area, a 50-year-old man died and several others sustained injuries after police used force to disperse a crowd which it alleged was creating ruckus near a polling booth. The victim’s wife alleged that her husband died because he was thrashed by policemen. It is being alleged that Mihi Lal was killed when two policemen thrashed him while he was waiting for his turn to cast vote. Additional superintendent of police (SP) Pavitra Mohan Tripathi has assured action and asked his family to file a complaint. Superintendent of police (SP) Kirit Kumar told TOI, “The polling centre is near the road. A few voters had assembled there and when the police team tried to control the crowd, people thought that police had resorted to baton charge and they began to run. This is when the man fell on the road and sustained injury. ASP is probing the incident and action would be taken once the autopsy report is available.” While about 130km away in Moradabad, a former gram pradhan’s brother was allegedly shot dead by political rivals hours before the polling started. Udaipal (45) was allegedly shot dead in Kafiyabad village of the district on late Sunday night. Former village pradhan Mitrapal and his brother Udaipal sustained bullet injuries and were taken to hospital. Udaipal succumbed on the way. Station house officer (SHO) of Bhojpur police station, Moradabad, Manoj Kumar Singh said, “In the attack, Ashish Kumar, a village pradhan candidate, opened fire at Udaipal and his brother Mitrapal. Udaipal died later.” While at least 10 people were injured in Meerut’s Samaspur village in a group clash. Another four persons were injured in Meerut’s Kaili Rampur village when two groups fought amid claims of fake voting. Claims of bogus voting also led to a clash in Firozabad district, where at least six persons were injured. A group of men broke the window of the polling centre and tried to loot the ballot boxes there.

This is the fifth case of sexual abuse of a dog in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) where a police complaint was registered. Irfan Bagwan (30) was arrested on Sunday on the basis of a video of him sexually abusing a stray behind his building in Nilemore, Nalasopara (west). A video of him sexually abusing the dog at around 10 am on Sunday was shot by a building resident who feeds the stray. She handed over the video to an animal activist Prem Goradiya who helped the building secretary file the police complaint on Monday. The electronic evidence was submitted to the police. Bagwan who stays in the building with his wife, child and brother was booked for an obscene act in public (IPC 294) and cruelty against the animal. He was remanded to police custody by the Vasai court on Monday. Palghar district Animal Welfare Officer Mitesh Jain said that Bagwan should have been booked for unnatural sex (IPC 377). He said that four cases of sexual abuse of dogs were registered in Andheri, Kalina, Mulund and Nerul in five months. In all the cases, the accused were booked for unnatural sex. Police said that the video will be verified before the IPC section of unnatural sex is added. Building residents told the police that they had seen the accused going to the rear side of the housing society several times in the last few days. It was on Sunday that one of the residents managed to capture the video on her cellphone, said Goradiya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-1-held-for-sexually-abusing-stray-dog/articleshow/82265679.cms||---

Unfortunately, a woman patient, who was critical, succumbed to the infection around eight hours after being shifted,” he said.Jaywanshi said though the hospital had a backup of jumbo oxygen cylinders, patients on ventilator cannot sustain the limited flow from these cylinders. The hospital where the oxygen was running out had 60 patients while the other hospital had 200.Hingoli district requires 10 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen per day for Covid patients. However, after the administration took corrective measures and plugged some leaks, the daily requirement has come down to 8 MT.Until recent, Hingoli was solely dependent on a Jalna-based oxygen manufacturing plant. However, with increasing demand, the district is sourcing oxygen from Bellary in Karnataka and Chakan in Pune. “In case there is a delay in getting oxygen from either of these places, we take it on loan from adjacent districts and return it as soon as we get our refill,” said Jaywanshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/12-covid-patients-shifted-as-hingoli-hosp-runs-out-of-o2/articleshow/82262790.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Shops operate smoothly on 1st day under new timings||JAIPUR: New restrictions on markets which are now allowed to operate from 6am to 11am saw fewer violations on Day-1 on Monday. The new guidelines appeared to be communicated well by the government with most of the permitted shops opening at 6am and shutting down at the stipulated time. “I was surprised to see even customers arriving at 6:30 am. The footfall in the limited period was more than I had expected,” said Ramkumar Gupta, who runs Gupta General Store at Imli Phatak. People gathered in large numbers at vegetable and fruits market in the morning as they knew that shops would down their shutters by 11 am. However, new guidelines have allowed street vendors to sell vegetables and fruits till 5 pm, providing much relief to people. “The deadline of 11 am is very early for anyone to go out and buy groceries or to meet anyone. I have my family friends down with Covid and in isolation. I have a doubt how the will police exempt me from visiting their house and deliver food two times a day,” said Mannu Sharma, a resident at Durgapura. By afternoon, traffic saw a sudden decline with very few vehicles on the roads. Police patrolling was continuous in the city. In the last 24 hours, Jaipur police have taken 2,839 actions for Covid violations. It included 388 mask violations. Throughout the day, police have collected Rs 4, 66, 400 fine from the violators across the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/shops-operate-smoothly-on-1st-day-under-new-timings/articleshow/82264820.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh government offers incentives for Oxygen plants||INDORE: As the nation gasps for oxygen in the deadly second wave of the Covid pandemic, the Madhya Pradesh government has proposed to incentivise manufacture of oxygen, cylinders and oxygen concentrators. MP doesn’t have any major oxygen plant and is dependent on other states during this deepening crisis. The state government has now prepared a draft policy note, proposing basic investment assistance of 50% in plant, machinery and building, or a maximum Rs 75 crore, plus other incentives, for those wishing to set up oxygen plants here. “We want industries to set up units for oxygen, manufacture of cylinders, concentrators and oxygen-production equipment in the state. We have a special package for them. A few industries in Bhopal and Jabalpur have already spoken to me on this. We want to know the feedback of industries and their expectations on the draft policy note,” said Sanjay Shukla, principal secretary, industrial policy and investment promotion department. Amid the spike in Covid-19 infections, industrial supply of oxygen has been completely stopped and routed to hospitals to save lives. All the plants generating oxygen for industrial purposes have been roped in for medical supply. The government also proposes reimbursing industries on expenditure incurred in safety standards, and offers a rebate of Re 1 per unit on power tariff. Industries apprehend slow response to the state’s offer because of fears that mega oxygen projects may not be viable in MP once the Covid pandemic wanes. High cost of transportation to export-oriented units is also an issue, they say. Industry players say it’s a good package but feel the government should have bought it at least a year ago. Gautam Kothari, president of Pithampur Audhyogik Sangathan said, “This subsidy may help hospitals and medical colleges set up big plants but there may not be many takers from industries because they need long-term viable plans. Industries that need oxygen for their internal use may go for it, otherwise there will be issues in marketing the finished product after the pandemic.” Ashok Khandelia, president of Association of Industries Dewas, said, “It is definitely a good step but it has come very late. Existing plants may benefit by expanding their capacity but new plants may not benefit that much as one has to study the demand of oxygen in the future.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-govt-offers-incentives-for-o2-plants/articleshow/82264005.cms||Meenakshi Sharma
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Intra-state travel curbs on private cars create confusion||JAIPUR: Restrictions on private vehicles plying within the state have led to chaos along the border of almost all the districts. Jaipur Rural police have set up checkposts at 40 bordering areas such as Dudu, Jobner, Fagi, Govindgarh, Shahpura, Gonera, Kotputli, among others and have asked private vehicles heading out of the city for another district to return barring those facing medical emergency. Police have also forced commuters to board government buses running on 50% capacity. Many have claimed that they are more vulnerable to infection while travelling in such buses more than in a private car. Throughout the day, citizens were seen confronting police over guidelines and questioning the logic behind allowing buses but preventing four-wheelers. “I understand that the government has to impose restrictions to control the cases, but allowing only those with medical urgency is a flawed idea. I work in Alwar and spent my weekend in Jaipur with my parents who live alone. Now, will I take exemption of travelling once a week? Should I get fake medical certificates to travel? said Rishabh Jain, who was stopped from travelling to Alwar. Several of those who have to attend the marriage ceremonies face the brunt of the restrictions. A family was stopped going to a resort 100 km from Jaipur on Delhi highway. They were aware of the restrictions, but presumed that if marriages are happening, guests would be allowed. “I have shown the wedding invite and our clothes to make them believe that we are heading for marriage but the policeman refused to remove the barricade. We were told to get permission from the higher authorities forcing us to return home,” said Gaurav Chaturvedi, an IT engineer in Jaipur. The fear of infection becomes much higher in public buses than in private cars. Experts have said Covid 19 appropriate behaviour is not possible in buses even at 50% capacity. SP Jaipur Rural Shankar Dutt said traffic was comparatively very less than the usual days as they didn’t see much crowd on the roads due to proper communication on the travel ban. “I would like to appeal to all travellers that if your reason is genuine, police will cooperate with you and allow you to go ahead,” said Dutt, who has deployed 450 policemen along with several senior officials to impose a ban on interstate travel. Similar was the situation at other places. Ankit Goyal, a spice trader in Ajmer, heads to Kishangarh every day in his car didn’t realise he would be stopped on the outskirts of his city. “I told police that I am travelling within the district, but was stopped and asked to take a bus to reach my destination. The city bus takes an hour instead of 30 minutes to reach my spice godown. I will prefer to stay at home than take risk,” said Goyal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/intra-state-travel-curbs-on-pvt-cars-create-confusion/articleshow/82264835.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Pregnant tigress in Maharashtra choked to death, paws chopped||NAGPUR: Probably in one of the most shocking incidents, a four-year-old pregnant tigress with four fetuses in her womb was brutally killed by unidentified poachers in the Mukutban forest range on Sunday. The matter was kept under wraps by the forest department for more than 24 hours for reasons best known to them. This is the 17th tiger death in Maharashtra in a little over three months. At least 11 of these deaths are due to poaching or under mysterious circumstances not proved yet. This is the second tigress poached in Pandharkawda division in one month. A tigress died in a wire snare on March 23 in Ghonsa in Maregaon range but forest officials are still clueless. The number of tiger deaths in three months in Maharashtra is quite high compared to the overall deaths in a year in 2018 (20), 2019 (22) and 2020 (20). With 8 months to go for the year to end, more such deaths cannot be ruled out. Yavatmal CCF SV Ramarao said, “The incident came to light at 10.30am on Sunday in compartment number 30 in the Mangurla reserve forest. The tigress was found dead in a small cave near a nullah. The tigress had wounds of wire snares in her neck and other injuries on her body which were inflicted by some sharp-edged weapons. Two front paws of the animal were also chopped. We have sought police help to crack the case.” Sources said, “There was a slight gap to enter the cave. The fetuses that were recovered during the post-mortem were nearly 60 days and considering the 3-3.5 months gestation period of tigers, it would have delivered the cubs next month. It is for this reason the animal had cleverly chosen the isolated 10-15-feet-long cave near the bamboo thickets apparently to deliver the cubs.” Veterinarians said, “The tigress carcass was 3-4 days old and highly putrefied. It had seven injury marks. The face and part of the skin had blisters due to the fire. There were puncture wounds on the body of the animal and the ribs were also broken. It is suspected that the tigress must have been choked to death first by the igniting fire as pictures show burned bamboo pieces at the cave entrance.” “It is possible that the tigress must have attempted to come out but the entry was blocked. She was attacked with sharp-edged weapons. Later, the poachers must have entered the cave and removed the paws with an axe. Other body parts were intact indicating the culprits were not organized poachers. Looking at the spot, it seems it may be the handiwork of some locals engaged in making bamboo mats. Wire snares were also found near the spot,” said Subhash Puranik, Pandharkawda DFO (wildlife). However, even after 40 hours of the incident, the forest officials were clueless. Yavatmal SP Dilip Patil Bhujbal said, “CCF has sought police help and on Monday, the SDPO and the staff visited the spot to investigate to get any clues so that the dog squad can be deployed. Our staff is doing intelligence gathering and we will provide all help to the forest department to nab the culprits.” The lackluster monitoring of tigers in territorial areas in the state has come in for sharp criticism, especially when the forest ministry is with CM Uddhav Thackeray himself. The Pandharkawda division and Tipeshwar have a history of laying wire snares by locals but there is no regular foot patrolling. As per the statistics by the Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), 7 tigers and 15 leopards have died due to wire snares in Maharashtra in the last decade. “Due to the increase in tiger numbers in protected areas, animals are dispersing in territorial areas where protection seems to have collapsed leading to a spurt in poaching,” said Yadav Tarte and Bandu Dhotre, both state wildlife board members. Wildlife expert Kishor Rithe said, “Despite a long history of laying wire snares to kill wild animals in the entire Pandharkawda division, no lessons have been learned.” Wildlife photographer Sarosh Lodhi said, “Even after so many tiger deaths, no accountability is fixed. Clearly, the Telangana-Maharashtra border at Adilabad having a population of tigers is becoming the snare capital of India.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pregnant-tigress-choked-to-death-paws-chopped/articleshow/82264828.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The directorate of health (DHS) has a list of 110 IMA doctors, of the pool of 350-400, to seek their services in any capacity they can in Covid management in their respective talukas. Health secretary Ravi Dhawan had a meeting with representatives of IMA to work out the modalities. Last week, chief minister Pramod Sawant had asked IMA if it could manage and run the MPT hospital which has been declared a Covid hospital. An official present for the meeting said, “I don’t think many are willing to work full-time at any Covid hospital or Covid care centre as all have their private practices or work as consultants in other hospitals.” IMA president Dr Vinayak Buvaji said it is not that the IMA members don’t want to help. “IMA can’t take over MPT hospital for practical difficulties. From where are we to get drugs, workers and other resources?” he said. He, however, said their members are willing to contribute a few hours every day at a facility or Covid hospital. He pointed out that several of their members who are specialists have been on Covid duties in private hospitals. As of Monday, about 15 private hospitals were admitting Covid patients and a couple more were to start operations in the next few days. “Private doctors can’t leave their non-Covid patients. Who would cater to them?” he said. A senior private doctor said some private hospitals are using their influence to delay or not open up for Covid patients fearing other (non-Covid) patients will turn away. Another IMA member said that young doctors should take the responsibility and offer their services. Of 1,500 IMA members, about 700 are government doctors. Of the balance, over 300 are above the age of 60 with comorbidities, and cannot be asked to carry out Covid duties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/unable-to-take-over-mpt-covid-hospital-says-ima/articleshow/82265684.cms||---

The carcass was spotted by a patrol team in Chandpura beat of Dudhwa range. There were no injury marks on the carcass, DTR staff said. The condition of the carcass suggested that the pachyderm had died two days ago. But it was not clear whether it had died a natural death or was poisoned. An autopsy is being done by a panel of three veterinarians. The cow elephant had rolled in a sandy bed of a dry water body before dying as its carcass was coated with mud, they said. According to the last elephant census in 2017, Dudhwa had 137 wild elephants. The numbers fluctuate as the herds move between India and Nepal. Manoj Sonkar, deputy director, DTR, said, “All the organs of the elephant were intact and there were no injury marks or signs of infighting. We deployed a dog squad and checked the area. Prima facie it appears that the elephant died a natural death but the actual cause will be ascertained after the autopsy by Dr Daya Shankar, Dr Baburam Nigam and Dr Arvind Kumar Singh. The videography of the autopsy will be done. The principal chief conservator of forests and other senior officials have been informed about the elephant death. We have asked all the patrol staff to be alert and keep an eye on all suspicious activities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/wild-cow-elephant-found-dead-in-dudhwa/articleshow/82263395.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Thus, one in every 100 patients succumbed to Covid. Gujarat became 11th state of India to cross 5 lakh cases on Monday with yet another peak of 14,340.The state also recorded its highest daily deaths at 158, taking the death toll to 6,486. For the state, it was the fastest journey of 1 lakh cases and 1,000deaths. “It’s the comparison of 2020 and 2021 right there,” said a city-based epidemiologist. “Earlier it was believed that this wave is all about rapid spread with milder symptoms. But as the daily numbers started escalating, it was evident that the number of critical patients is increasing very fast. Dependency on oxygen is a major factor.” Ahmedabad and Surat recorded over half of the deaths and cases during this period. But experts pointed out that the spread in other cities and districts increased manifold. Compared to over 67% of the cases being recorded from four municipal corporations – Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot – on Monday, the figure was just 57%, pointing at much higher contribution from other districts. Likewise, on Monday, only 52% of the deaths were recorded from eight municipal corporations – the figure which was close to 70% till the last week, said experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/1100-deaths-1-lakh-cases-in-state-in-8-days/articleshow/82264840.cms||---

---||India||A year on, only 1,703 flats given to migrants||NEW DELHI: Almost a year after the government announced the Affordable Rental Housing Complex (ARHC) scheme for migrant workers in cities, only 1,703 such flats have been allotted in Chandigarh. Five states of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand are at an advanced stage for renting out existing 5,100 government-funded houses, according to government data. More than half of these houses which are being converted into AHRC under public private partnership (PPP) are in Gujarat alone. The government had last year identified nearly 88,000 such houses which could be rented out to migrant workers. The massive exercise was carried out when a large number of migrant workers left for their native places. According to the official data of the housing and urban affairs ministry, 31 states and UTs have signed the memorandum of agreements (MoAs) with it. Sources said that it takes time for converting identified houses to ARHC as state governments need to engage a private player or a public entity to carry out repair and maintenance of such complexes. These entities are allowed to recover the investment from rental at a rate notified by the local authority concerned. The second component of the scheme is to bring in private players to build such complexes and rent them out as per the norms set by the government. The government has come out with several incentives to attract private investment in this sector. The housing ministry had recently invited proposals from private and public entities to set up such complexes on vacant land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/a-year-on-only-1703-flats-given-to-migrants/articleshow/82266817.cms||Dipak K Dash

MLA Gyasuddin Sheikh made a few desperate calls and tweeted, tagging the official handle of the AMC. Civic officials were quick to respond and by 12.44am a van arrived with 10 jumbo oxygen cylinders. “Their liquid oxygen tank had technical issues and was not functional,” said the AMC official. The cylinders were provided from SVP Hospital stock. Meanwhile, officials arranged for the refilling of 20 more cylinders, which continued till 2.30am. “The whole operation got over in a little over two hours.” The AMC has teamed with Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) and Gujarat FDCA to form a 24-hour oxygen helpline. In all, the helpline ensured refilling of 370 cylinders between 10pm on Sunday and 6pm on Monday. The control room attended to 32 calls seeking help in oxygen logistics. These included calls from Pushya Hospital in Navrangpura, Central United Hospital in Odhav, Singhu Hospital and Savior Hospital in Navrangpura and SBM hospital in Motera.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-scrambles-at-hospitals-sos-call/articleshow/82264905.cms||---

---||Trichy||Challenging times, says CM on opening of Sterlite plant||Chennai: Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Monday said the state was going through challenging times due to shortage of oxygen. The state government convened an all-party meeting with a responsibility since everyone was responsible to save the lives of people. DMK chief M K Stalin said the toxic plant would not be reopened under any circumstances when DMK comes to power. The state government had invited only eight recognised political parties for the meeting, the AIADMK, the DMK, the BJP, the Congress, the PMK, the DMDK and the Left parties. “The government wanted to convene a meeting of all parties. Since the case is going to come up for hearing today or tomorrow, all parties could not be invited,” the chief minister said, while making his opening remarks. He went into details of the case filed by Vendata for reopening the plant to produce 1,050MT of oxygen from its Tuticorin plant, which has been shut down since May 2018, after protests erupted over environmental damages caused by the plant in the vicinity. The Madras high court had upheld the closure of the unit. Palaniswami recalled the industry’s interim plea before the Supreme Court, requesting permission to produce 1,050MT of oxygen a day and could be supplied to nearest hospitals and to other parts of the country free of cost. The industry also promised to produce oxygen within two to four weeks. The positivity and fatality rate were brought down due to the preventive measures taken by the government during the first wave, the CM said. The impact of the second wave was also under control due to the efforts taken to ramp up health infrastructure, including increase of oxygen storage in government hospitals and bed facilities. “Though the impact is not that high in comparison with other states, we get to see the rising Covid cases every day. There is a need to increase ramp up further, especially oxygen production capacity,” Palaniswami said. He shot off a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday urging him not to divert the oxygen produced in the state to other states. In a statement, DMK chief MK Stalin said the state government’s decision to reopen Sterlite unit for oxygen production and supply power to the unit was only a temporary decision. The TNCC represented by former president K V Thangkabalu and working president K Jayakumar, said the temporary arrangement could be permitted given the Covid surge, the need to save lives and that of the demand of oxygen. The monitoring committee led by the district collector should oversee the production as well as distribution, the party said. CPM state secretary K Balakrishnan said the government should take over the control of Sterlite unit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/challenging-times-says-cm-on-opening-of-sterlite-plant/articleshow/82264843.cms||---

The incident sparked serious outrage, forcing the Beed district administration to rush a team to Ambajogai, around 220km from here, to look into the matter.An eyewitness to the incident alleged that the police present near the ambulance snatched the mobile phones of at least two relatives of the deceased who were filming and clicking pictures of the bodies stuffed in the ambulance. Their phones were returned only after the last rites of the deceased were performed, he said. Officials said the 22 bodies, placed in body bags, were picked from the mortuary of the Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada Government Medical College (SRTMGMC), Ambajogai, and kept in the ambulance (MH-29/AT-0299). As per hospital records, the ambulance is a mobile ICU. Authorities said 14 of the 22 deceased had died on Saturday and the rest on Sunday. Nine had died at the Lokhandi Savargaon jumbo Covid centre. When contacted, Beed district collector Ravindra Jagtap said, “The incident is very unfortunate and I have ordered the Ambajogai additional collector to probe the matter. We will definitely initiate action against anyone found guilty.”Another eyewitness, Abhijit Jagtap, confirmed to TOI that two relatives who had tried filming the bodies in the ambulance had their mobiles phones taken away by the policemen around.A relative of one of the deceased said he was angry about the way in which the bodies were transported but did not have evidence.When contacted, SRTMGMC dean Dr Shivaji Sukre said, “There are just two ambulances to carry dead bodies to the crematorium. We have demanded more ambulances. Our responsibility is to hand over bodies to the Ambajogai civic body to perform the last rites. What the civic body does is not in our control.”Sukre said that as per an arrangement, the civic body collects bodies twice a day for cremation.Ambajogai municipal council CEO Ashok Sable said, “All bodies from the Lokhandi Savargaon-based dedicated Covid hospital and SRTMGMC are brought to the crematorium. Our squad’s responsibility is to perform the last rites. We neither have an ambulance nor manpower to lift and transport the bodies.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/bodies-of-22-covid-victims-in-beed-stuffed-into-single-ambulance-taken-for-cremation/articleshow/82262817.cms||Mohammed Akhef

According to officials, over 50% turnout was recorded till 5pm-- a sharp dip from the earlier two phases which witnessed over 70% voting. Polling was held in Shamli, Meerut, Moradabad, Pilibhit, Kasganj, Firozabad, Auraiya, Kanpur Dehat, Jalaun, Hamirpur, Fatehpur, Unnao, Amethi, Barabanki, Balrampur, Siddharthanagar, Deoria, Chandauli, Mirzapur and Ballia districts. Several districts in western UP witnessed clashes in which two persons died and scores of others were injured. In Pilibhit’s Neuria area, a 50-year-old man died and several others sustained injuries after police used force to disperse a crowd which it alleged was creating ruckus near a polling booth. The victim’s wife alleged that her husband died because he was thrashed by policemen. It is being alleged that Mihi Lal was killed when two policemen thrashed him while he was waiting for his turn to cast vote. Additional superintendent of police (SP) Pavitra Mohan Tripathi has assured action and asked his family to file a complaint. Superintendent of police (SP) Kirit Kumar told TOI, “The polling centre is near the road. A few voters had assembled there and when the police team tried to control the crowd, people thought that police had resorted to baton charge and they began to run. This is when the man fell on the road and sustained injury. ASP is probing the incident and action would be taken once the autopsy report is available.” While about 130km away in Moradabad, a former gram pradhan’s brother was allegedly shot dead by political rivals hours before the polling started. Udaipal (45) was allegedly shot dead in Kafiyabad village of the district on late Sunday night. Former village pradhan Mitrapal and his brother Udaipal sustained bullet injuries and were taken to hospital. Udaipal succumbed on the way. Station house officer (SHO) of Bhojpur police station, Moradabad, Manoj Kumar Singh said, “In the attack, Ashish Kumar, a village pradhan candidate, opened fire at Udaipal and his brother Mitrapal. Udaipal died later.” While at least 10 people were injured in Meerut’s Samaspur village in a group clash. Another four persons were injured in Meerut’s Kaili Rampur village when two groups fought amid claims of fake voting. Claims of bogus voting also led to a clash in Firozabad district, where at least six persons were injured. A group of men broke the window of the polling centre and tried to loot the ballot boxes there.

---||Nagpur||WhatsApp group admin not liable for content posted by members: Bombay HC||NAGPUR: In a ruling that will provide big relief to WhatsApp group administrators, Nagpur bench of Bombay high court held they can’t be held liable if objectional content has been posted by a member, unless it is proved there was common intention or pre-arranged plan between them. “In the absence of specific penal provision creating vicarious liability, the administrator can’t be held liable for objectionable content posted by a member. Common intention can’t be established in the case of WhatsApp service users merely acting as an administrator,” a division bench of Justices Zaka Haq and Amir Borkar held. While quashing a police complaint against a Gondia man for alleged sexual harassment under Section 354-A(1)(iv) along with Sections 509 and 107 of IPC and Section 67 of the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000, the bench observed the administrator doesn’t have power to regulate, moderate or censor the content before it is posted. “The administrators are the ones who create the group by adding/deleting the members. Every group has one or more administrators, who control members’ participation. A group administrator has limited power of removing/adding the members. Once the group is created, the administrators’ and members' functions are at par with each other, except addition/deletion powers. But, if a member posts any objectionable content, s/he can be held liable under relevant provisions of law,” the court said. Petitioner Kishor Tarone through counsel Rajendra Daga had knocked the judiciary’s doors for quashing the charge sheet before JMFC court in Arjuni Morgaon on the complaint of a woman in 2016. The woman accused him, the admin, of not removing another member who had used filthy words against her in their WhatsApp group. She also alleged the petitioner had failed to ask the member to tender an apology and expressed helplessness in helping her. The judges, however, made it clear that when a person creates a WhatsApp group, they can’t be expected to presume or to have advance knowledge of the criminal acts of a member. “In our opinion, in the facts of present case, non-removal of a member or failure to seek apology from him, who had posted the objectionable remark, would not amount to making sexually coloured remarks by the administrator. We are, therefore, satisfied that continuation of present proceedings against the applicant would amount to abuse of process of court.” They added that even if allegations in FIR are accepted as correct and considering the material in form of charge sheet on its face value, it doesn’t disclose essential ingredients of offences alleged against the petitioner under Sections 354-A(1)(iv), 509 and 107 of IPC and Section 67 of the IT Act, 2000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/whatsapp-group-admin-not-liable-for-content-posted-by-members-hc/articleshow/82264879.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: 3 private hospital staffers of Hapur arrested for stealing, selling Remdesivir vials in black||MEERUT: Three staffers of a prominent hospital in UP's Hapur district were arrested on Monday for allegedly pilfering vials of Remdesivir injection bought by Covid-19 patients and selling them in the black market. A patient who was to be administered the injection died. A vial and Rs 82,000 in cash were recovered from their possession. The trio -- Shivam Kumar, Puneet Singh and Gaurav Kumar -- managed to sell four or five vials at higher prices before they landed in the police net. They were arrested following a tip-off by a customer who was trying to buy the medicine from them. According to Hapur police, the trio allegedly used to steal the Remdesivir vials bought by Covid patients and sell it to other patients at a premium. They would dupe the legitimate owners by showing them empty vials, claiming they had been injected. “Each stolen vial was sold between Rs 25,000-40,000, depending on the negotiation with the buyer,” said Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, Hapur superintendent of police. “Their pilferage caused the death of a patient who did not receive his dose. We will seek strict punishment, including imposition of the National SecurityAct, against the accused,” the SP said. Two days ago, eight people, including two nurses at a private hospital in Meerut, were arrested for selling Remdesivir vial meant for a patient for Rs 32,000 each in the black market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/3-pvt-hosp-staffers-of-hapur-arrested-for-stealing-selling-remdesivir-vials-in-black/articleshow/82263401.cms||---
---||Mumbai||‘Let vax recipients donate blood between two shots’||MUMBAI: After the Centre increased the gap between two vaccine shots, activists want it to now allow people to donate blood in the interim period and not wait for 60 days without donating. The central health ministry, though, has not yet issued updated guidelines on blood donations between vaccine shots. With the mass vaccination drive for the 18-15 age group —who also comprise the biggest group of blood donors —scheduled to start on May 1, NGOs involved in voluntary blood donation are worried that the earlier notification would lead to blood stocks dipping further in the city. On March 5, the governing body of the National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC) approved the deferral criteria for blood donation as “28 days post vaccination”, irrespective of the type of vaccine received. “The deferral period may be reviewed as and when necessary,” said the note signed by NBTC director Sunil Gupta on March 5. As per this notification, people cannot donate blood for 56 days after the first vaccination. After the March 5 notification, the central health ministry increased the gap between two Covishield shots from 28 days to between four and eight weeks, and up to 42 days between two Covaxin shots. Think Foundation’s Vinay Shetty has written to the council seeking clarity in this regard. “I assume that by the ‘last’ dose you mean the last dose that was taken, irrespective of whether the last dose taken was the first one or the second. In other words, after every dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, there is a deferral period of 28 days for blood donation,” he has asked. India’s deferral period for blood donation is already among the longest. The American Red Cross has a deferral period of 14 days for vaccines made from live attenuated virus and none for mRNA vaccines. The UK has a deferral period of seven days for the Oxford vaccine, which is called Covishield in India. When contacted, NBTC’s Dr Shrinivas Murty said, “As per the rules, blood donation post-Covid vaccination can be done only after 28 days of receiving the last dose of the vaccine. If the two doses are 30 days apart, then one can donate after 28 days thereafter.” However, he added the rule was made at a time when the gap between shots was 30 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/let-vax-recipients-donate-blood-between-two-shots/articleshow/82265422.cms||---

Senior police and administrative officials rushed to the spot to take stock of the situation in the village. Family members of the deceased claimed spurious liquor behind the deaths. Relative of one of the deceased Neeraj Singh, 28, alleged the latter had consumed liquor on Sunday evening and died later at night. However, according to the police, families of the deceased have given it in writing, claiming deaths were due to "natural causes". Senior officials said that they are yet to ascertain the reason behind the five deaths in Sadharanpur village. "A father-son duo died yesterday while the remaining three died today. Family members of all the deceased have given us in writing that some died due to lack of oxygen and were refused admission at hospitals. An investigation is ongoing and we are trying to get to the bottom of this," Keshav Kumar, SP (Rural), said. Meerut went to panchayat polls in the third phase on Monday. Sources claimed country-made liquor was distributed by a certain pradhan candidate and the liquor, most likely spurious, has caused the death. Police have refuted such claims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/amid-panchayat-polls-5-die-in-meerut-village-family-alleges-spurious-liquor-behind-deaths/articleshow/82263414.cms||---

Station house officer (SHO) of Bhojpur police station, Moradabad, Manoj Kumar Singh said, “In the attack, Ashish Kumar, a village pradhan candidate, opened fire at Udaipal and his brother Mitrapal. Udaipal died later.” While at least 10 people were injured in Meerut’s Samaspur village in a group clash. Another four persons were injured in Meerut’s Kaili Rampur village when two groups fought amid claims of fake voting. Claims of bogus voting also led to a clash in Firozabad district, where at least six persons were injured. A group of men broke the window of the polling centre and tried to loot the ballot boxes there.

---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Coal trader shot dead by bike-borne youths||MEERUT: In a broad daylight murder in Meerut, two bike-borne youths shot a prominent coal trader while he was sitting at his shop on Monday morning. Even before anyone could understand what was happening, the youths turned around and fled the scene. Coal trader Arun Jain, 54, was rushed to hospital where he was pronounced dead. Rohit Kumar, one of the office attendants at the time of firing, said, "The two masked men entered office and pulled out weapons and started firing at Jain and then disappeared from the scene." Jain was accompanied by his son Ayush on the first floor of his new office. "One of the youths wore green-coloured shirt and since the new office was inaugurated just two days ago, the CCTV cameras were not yet in working condition." Now, police are trying to find the footage of nearby shops. Circle officer Amit Rai said, "Several teams have been deployed to trace the killers. Forensic experts are already in place and family is being questioned about the possible enmity that led to the attack." Trade associations are angry with the development. Naveen Gupta, president of Joint Trade Association, said, "The daredevilry shown by the killers is reflective of the fact how easy it is to kill anyone in this city. We have demanded from the police immediate identification and arrest of the culprits." The killing was quite similar to the one that took place in Meerut six months ago when four armed men barged into a showroom in a busy Meerut market, shot dead a jeweller and left with cash and silver ornaments worth lakhs. The jeweller, Aman Jain, 26, was shot in the head and breathed his last in a hospital a few hours later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/coal-trader-shot-dead-by-bike-borne-youths/articleshow/82263425.cms||Sandeep Rai

The CEC has also said that using new virgin areas of the pristine forests of the Bhagwan Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuary and Mollem National Park is not recommended for laying of a new 400KV power transmission line. The committee has said that the high tension lines could be pulled on the route of existing lines. TOI has relentlessly reported how experts believe that the three Centre-sponsored infrastructure projects have the potential to turn the Mollem forest — one of the eight biodiversity hotspots of the world — into a parched land, while also posing a mighty threat to the endemism, and the flora and fauna of the region. “The only justification given by the user agency for this rail-doubling project is due to industrial growth in Karnataka and growth of tourism, and that the existing single-railway line capacity is saturated,” the CEC said. “But there are no material facts and figures to support the claim of growth of industry and tourism and saturation of the existing single line,” the CEC stated.  The CEC recommended to the SC “to revoke the permission granted by the standing committee of the national board for wildlife for doubling of the railway track passing through the ecologically sensitive Western Ghats from Tinaighat-Castlerock in Karnataka to Kulem in Goa”. In its April 23 submission to the Supreme Court, the CEC also recommended that environmental approvals be sought for expansion of NH-4A through Mollem’s forest, though it has allowed the project to go ahead by suggesting some modifications. The CEC noted that the existing single line of the railway itself is not being utilised to capacity. “CEC does not find any justification for undertaking a project of this nature, which will destroy the fragile ecosystem of the Western Ghats, which is an internationally-recognised biodiversity hotspot and also one of the most important wildlife corridors of the country,” the panel said. Also, this doubling project will only marginally enhance the capacity of “the most inefficient section of the railway network passing through ecologically sensitive and biodiversity rich tiger reserve, two wildlife sanctuaries and a national park”, the report states, in a scathing criticism of the project. There will be fragmentation of the habitat for wild animals, the report notes. About the 400kV transmission line and substation project, the CEC has said that instead of clearing canopy of virgin forest cover along the 10.5km long corridor, Goa should draw the proposed 400kV line through the existing 220kV corridor line in the state. “The standing committee on power system planning in the western region was aware of the importance attached to forest clearances in the Western Ghat region. However it missed to examine the best alternative of replacement of the existing 220kV line with the 400kV line, which is an existing line and passing through the already-cleared forest cover in the national park and wildlife sanctuaries,” the CEC has said. A new proposed corridor through virgin forest is certain to cause imbalance to the equilibrium of the existing forest ecosystem, the CEC has noted. The CEC has similarly pointed out why no environment clearance was sought for the NH-4A expansion when the project covers more than 100km in length, requiring environmental clearance under the EIA notification, 2006. Claude Alvares of Goa Foundation, based on whose application to the SC the CEC was formed, said, “On the highway, the committee has said the alleviated highway should be started from a different point. All wildlife groups will study the proposal. But what is important for the highway is that the CEC has asked where is your environment clearance? Noone should move an inch on these projects till the Supreme Court decides on these recommendations of the CEC.” Abhijit Prabhudesai of Goyant Kollso Naka, said that their protests will continue till all projects are scrapped in reality. “Transmission line and highway projects too should be cancelled, as there is no requirement of these projects. The Supreme Court should accept the recommendations on cancellation of the railway project. We will fight till all three projects are cancelled,” said Prabhudesai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mollem-gets-a-breather-no-double-tracking-says-panel/articleshow/82265693.cms||---

Deputy leader of the Congress in the assembly and Danilimda MLA, Shailesh Parmar, said the spurt in Covid-19 cases is leading to patients waiting for several hours before 108 ambulances arrive to take them to hospitals. “Only patients who reach Covid hospitals in 108 ambulances are granted admission,” Parmar said. “When patients are having to wait for up 24 hours for a 108 ambulance, the state government should allow people to bring patients in private vehicles and admit them,” Parmar demanded in the letter. Parmar said that at a time when there are limited 108 ambulances and the number of Covid-19 patients is shooting up, the government should allow even those patients to be admitted, who are brought to Covid hospitals in private vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/make-108-service-accessible-congress/articleshow/82264922.cms||---

The case was registered against Ramachandran of Marath House, Perungottukavu, in ward 10 of Elavancherry grama panchayat, for organizing a marriage party of his son at Perungottukavu Devaswom Hall on April 19 in violation of Covid-19 protocol. He was given permission to conduct the party with 100 invitees but more than 200 persons had attended it. Later, 20 persons, including the bride and groom tested positive for Covid-19 and the test results of more people are awaited. Thus the case was registered against the father for violating Covid-19 protocol restrictions, said Dr Mohammed Musthafa, medical officer of Elavancherry primary health centre. 1,342 new cases in Palakkad The district reported 1,342 Covid-19 positive cases and 320 persons recovered from it on Monday.

---||Kochi||Ernakulam district accounts for 16% of active Covid cases in Kerala||KOCHI: Of the total 2,18,893 active Covid cases in the state as on Sunday night, 16% are in Ernakulam district, which is adding 3,000 to 4,000 new cases daily to its Covid tally. The district has the highest number of active cases in Kerala — 35,614 — as on Sunday night. Of the 35,614 cases, 81% are undergoing home treatment and 1,788 patients are in hospitals. Of this, 1,222 are in private hospitals. As the cases mount, infrastructure also needs to be ramped up. But experts feel health department is not walking the talk in Ernakulam. Meanwhile, authorities face a rising challenge in the district as financially sound Covid patients with no other health issues get themselves admitted to private hospitals leaving critical patients in precarious situation. The district collector had urged the private hospitals to start telemedicine services to address the issue. “The infrastructure has not been increased as claimed by the authorities. Hopefully it will be addressed by the end of the week. We need more ICU and oxygen beds to tackle breathing problems of patients. Around 100 patients, who have breathlessness, required hospital admission on Sunday. It was difficult to shift all of them. Fifty per cent of the patients currently undergoing Covid treatment at private hospitals have only minor symptoms and they need only home care. Claiming they don’t have separate toilet facility at home or there are vulnerable people in their family, they refuse to get discharged. They can either go to Covid first-line treatment centres (CFLTCs) or domiciliary care centres (DCCs). Condition of many Covid positive youngsters turns critical suddenly due to breathlessness for two to three days and such cases need early treatment. But the current situation poses a big challenge. We will urge private hospitals to discharge patients with no major health issues,” said IMA, Ernakulam chapter, former president Dr Junaid Rahman. Meanwhile, health authorities reiterated that private hospitals should introduce teleconsultation with patients. “Health workers in government sector call patients directly and know their health condition. If the patient needs hospitalization, we arrange for it. Otherwise we ask them to undergo home care. Private hospitals should also do the same. Only those with issues require hospitalization. Others should remain in houses or CFLTCs. The district can manage the mounting cases if they follow this strategy,” said NHM district programme officer Dr Mathews Numpeli. Meanwhile, a meeting convened by the district collector with private hospital authorities on Monday night decided not to admit Category A patients as far possible in private hospitals. It has also been decided to take hotels, which remain unutilized, on rent to set up CFLTCs. Category A patients and those discharged from ICUs will be lodged in such CFLTCs till their condition stabilises. Some hospitals expressed interest to run such CFLTCs and they are looking for hotels. A consortium of general physicians in private hospitals will be formed and they will give necessary advice to patients in hospitals in rural areas. The private hospitals also said they are ready to increase the number of oxygen beds to its maximum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ekm-accounts-for-16-of-active-covid-cases-in-state/articleshow/82264056.cms||T C Sreemol
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Cops help a man perform last rites of his mother in Dhampur||BIJNOR: When Vikas Sharma’s mother breathed her last on Sunday evening, there was no one to help him carry her body to the crematorium and perform the last rites. A resident of Dhampur in Bijnor, Sharma’s elder brother had recently succumbed to Covid-19 and his relatives and neighbours were scared of coming to his house out of the fear of contracting the infection. But when nobody showed up to help him in his hour of need, the local police did. After SP Bijnor intervened in the matter, a few policemen came to Sharma’s house in the State Bank Colony where he was waiting with his mother’s body. Wearing PPE kits, they helped carry Sharma’s mother’s bier and participated in the last rites as well. Speaking to TOI, Sharma said that his elder brother had died some days ago and his 70-year-old mother, Sheela, breathed her last on Sunday. She had lost her husband and elder son this year and had since been keeping poor health. “Although her Covid test had come negative, she was undergoing treatment for overall weakness, a bit of fever and breathlessness. Her condition started to deteriorate in the last few days. When I contacted my relatives and neighbours to help me perform the last rites, they ostracised me. They were afraid of contracting Covid even though my mother had tested negative. Later, I contacted the cops and they helped me out. I am thankful to them for coming forward to help me,” said Sharma who works in a private firm in Dhampur and has a wife and two sons. When TOI contacted Bijnor superintendent of police, Dharamveer Singh, he confirmed the incident and said that people are living in fear of Covid. “It is necessary to take precautions but nobody should lose their humanity. Vikas Sharma contacted the cops and narrated his tale of grief. He burst into tears. The police came forward and helped him perform the last rites of his mother.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/cops-help-a-man-perform-last-rites-of-his-mother-in-dhampur/articleshow/82263430.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Kochi||Private hospitals in Kochi running out of Covid beds||KOCHI: Though the district administration claims that there is adequate infrastructure for Covid patients, concerns have been raised over reports about some major private hospitals turning away Covid patients citing shortage of beds. Hospital sources said inquiries about the availability of beds from patients looking to shift from small and medium hospitals to larger ones have been on the rise and that they are compelled to put them on waiting list. As it will take 10 days to subject the patients for antigen testing, there is a delay in their discharge, they said. “All 95 Covid beds in our hospital are occupied. We are not admitting new Covid patients. Antigen tests are conducted after 10 days. Seventy per cent of the calls we get are from relatives who want to shift patients from medium hospitals to ones with better facilities. We also receive a large number of calls from other districts, including Alappuzha and Kozhikode enquiring about availability of beds,” said a spokesperson of a private hospital near Cheranelloor. The hospital will start a first-line treatment centre in its annex, he added. Some private hospitals are questioning the reason behind the delay in converting the government medical college in Kalamassery to a full-time Covid facility. “We don’t have a single bed to accommodate Covid patients. Even Covid ICUs are full. Every hospital has to pitch in to deal with the crisis. The district is registering more than 3,000 new cases every day. The government has to do something. The government medical college at Kalamassery has not yet begun to function as a full-fledged Covid treatment facility,” said an official with another hospital in the city. Sources in a private hospital at Aluva also said it is grappling with scarcity of beds for Covid patients. Another one at Kakkanad said as of now, it has enough beds for Covid patients. Private hospital management association office bearers said it is the responsibility of the district administration to ensure that all private hospitals set aside minimum 25% of beds for Covid patients. “Some hospitals set aside 40-50% of beds for Covid treatment. Some may not earmark even 2 0% beds. It is up to the district administration to ensure the availability of beds,” said Dr Benevan Joseph, secretary of Kerala Private Hospitals Association. A total of 1,222 patients were under treatment in private hospitals as on Sunday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pvt-hosps-running-out-of-covid-beds/articleshow/82264059.cms||---

Gupta, who quit the civil service in 2002 to pursue his own business ventures, was a prime accused in the Rs 800 crore MEGA Metro Link Express for Gandhinagar and Ahmedabad Company Limited scam. He was also facing other cases. Gupta was a batchmate of the current Gujarat chief secretary Anil Mukim and present CAG, G C Murmu. Many of his friends in the Gujarat bureaucracy were shocked to hear about his death, and a number of them posted messages of condolence on social media. Gupta was considered to be a bright young IAS officer who was very close to former chief ministers Chimanbhai Patel and Keshubhai Patel. He was credited with formulating key port and industry related policies of the state government. However, in 2002, after then CM Narendra Modi took over, he quit the civil service and and joined a private sector company and also started his own hospitality and other businesses. After quitting the IAS, he was appointed as the chairman of MEGA company to execute the Ahmedabad metrorail project in April 2011. He remained in the position until August 2013. Gupta was forced to resign after allegations propped up of a Rs 800 crore scam in the project. Gujarat government also registered several cases against him. He was on bail after spending several months in jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sanjay-gupta-dies-of-covid-in-lucknow/articleshow/82264919.cms||---

Ghadge was attached to Bazaar Peth police station when Singh was Thane police commissioner. Ghadge has alleged that Singh, in the period between 2015 and 2108 when he was Thane city police chief, amassed assets by settling several financial and land disputes, extracted money from various builders and transport lobbies and misused government accomodation by maintaining two houses in Malabar Hill and Thane. Ghadge has alleged that Singh had allegedly extracted money for various transfers of policemen and has also registered false cases against those policemen who revolted against him, including himself. In 2015, Ghadge was suspended by Singh on alleged corruption charges. Ghadge alleged that Singh had framed him in a false case as they did not get along well. Ghadge said that while he was in Bazaar Peth police station, Singh forcibly closed down five cases. He alleged that Singh had also framed businessman Salil Chaturvedi in a drug case in 2006. This is the second corruption complaint against Singh, who is now the Director General (DG) of Maharashtra Home Guard. The earlier complaint was filed by Mumbai police officer Anup Dange. The complaint is in the form of a letter to the Director General of Police (DGP) on April 20, and is also marked to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and home minister Dilip Walse Patil. Singh was unavailable for comment and did not respond to the text messages. Ghadge said, “Whatever allegations I have made, I have evidence. I had earlier also lodged a complaint but there was no response.” He alleged that Singh has invested heavily in a company where his wife is on its board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-param-bir-is-corrupt-says-another-cop-in-letter-to-dgp/articleshow/82265713.cms||Ahmed Ali

The state government has urged the central government to provide 25 more tankers from the states which have a huge surplus. In comparison, Jharkhand is using 262 tankers, Tamil Nadu has 451 tankers, Maharashtra is using 388 tankers, Gujarat is using 296 tankers, Haryana is using 156 tankers and Uttar Pradesh is using 100 tankers. “We definitely need more tankers and we’ve already requested the government of India for additional 25 tankers. We need 25 more to meet the requirement till May 9. Many states have surplus tankers and we have urged the central government to provide tankers to us from these states,” said an official. “Central government has a role in allocation of the tankers and steps in wherever required. The number of tankers we have has already reached its limit.” Collector reconstitutes committee for distribution of medicines Jaipur: District Collector Antar Singh Nehra on Monday reconstituted a three-member committee for distribution of Remedisvir and Tocilizumab to private hospitals for treatment of Covid-19 patients on the basis of requirement, utility and availability of private hospitals.

---||Goa||No lockdown for now, will stop functions if SOPs violated in Goa: CM Pramod Sawant||PANAJI: Within minutes after the health minister Vishwajit Rane strongly pitched for a lockdown, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Monday said that the government has not taken any decision to impose a lockdown in the state. Sawant said that he has directed the Goa police and collectors to stop functions if SOPs are violated. “Life is more important than functions. The first step we have to take before a lockdown is to close down functions,” he said, while adding that “as of now no decision has been taken for a lockdown, if the situation continues will we have to take some harsh decisions”. “People should not attend weddings even if they are invited. They should not visit temples, churches, mosque for prayers,” he said. He also said that around 200 beds have been increased in the state for Covid patients. When the chief minister was asked to react to Rane’s tweet for a lockdown, Sawant said, “I have seen the tweet and will speak to him personally.” The state government cannot stop economic activities, he added. “If we do a lockdown, we will witness the situation of last March, April and May, and labourers will start leaving the state. Construction activities will come to a standstill. We want the pharma industry to continue. If the pharma industry does not manufacture medicines, then they cannot supply them to Goa and the entire country,” Sawant said. He also said that government offices cannot be closed down because “we have to work on disaster management”. “On a daily basis we have to increase around 200 beds, and we are doing it. Sufficient oxygen and medicines are available in the state,” the chief minister said. Speaking to mediapersons, Sawant said that he is sad because 38 people died on Monday due to Covid. Reacting to the sudden spike in cases, Sawant said that the state was expecting the rise in cases “because there was a 4,000 backlog of tests over the last eight days”. “In second wave, the virus is dangerous. The lungs get completely damaged, and once the lungs are damaged, patients cannot recover even after treatment,” Sawant said. Sawant said that Asilo hospital has been converted into Covid hospital and admission of patients has commenced. He said that beds have been also been increased at the sub-district hospital in Ponda and the ESI in Margao. While stating that the state government is committed to reduce the death rate, Sawant also said that new treatment protocol would be released for the public. He also said that inorder to facilitate Covid patients, the number of beds available would be mentioned taluka-wise. Hitting out at those who have been critical about the government’s handling of the pandemic, the chief minister said, “Instead of criticising, people should come forward and give suggestions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-lockdown-for-now-will-stop-functions-if-sops-violated-cm/articleshow/82265703.cms||---

In one of the videos, which was widely shared on social media, a man can be seen showing empty oxygen cylinders at the hospital and accusing the hospital administration of “mismanagement” with doctors and other staff “missing”. The district hospital has a 90-bed Covid ward and there are 20 beds reserved at the emergency ward. These are backed by 60 oxygen cylinders and a few oxygen concentrator machines. According to data available with the district health department, 8,627 patients have been tested positive for Covid-19, of them 72 have died, while 5,435 have been discharged after their recovery. The district still has 3,110 active cases at different hospitals. According to health department officials, they have been referring critical patients to a higher medical centre while some of them have been admitted to the L2 ward of the district hospital. In another video, a patient can be seen alleging that there is “no oxygen” in the ICU of L2 hospital "leaving patients breathless". Chief medical superintendent Gyanchand (goes by the first name) said, “There was a shortage of oxygen on Monday for a few hours, but the supply was restored soon. Besides, doctors and other staff have been visiting the Covid ward regularly. We are doing our best to provide the best treatment to the Covid patients and appeal to the people not to fall prey to rumours.” Adding to the woes, a major fire broke out in the Covid ward due to a short circuit around 11:30 pm on Sunday, creating a commotion. Additional superintendent of police Ranjan Kumar said, “We put out the fire in time. Besides, a team of electricians is keeping a close watch on the electric system at the hospital.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/covid-patients-kin-claim-bijnor-dist-hosp-running-out-of-oxygen-upload-videos/articleshow/82263435.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Goa||With 38 deaths in one day, Goa sets new record||PANAJI: Goa recorded 38 deaths on Monday, the highest single-day toll since the outbreak of the pandemic, taking the death toll up to 1,056. While the mortality rate dipped slightly to 34%, the state added 2,321 fresh cases. Even with these grim numbers, the state government warned that the situation would worsen over the next few days. “In my interaction with experts, I have been told that we might lost 200-300 more lives per day in the next 10 days, the situation is really grim. We are doing our best to save lives,” health minister Vishwajit Rane said. GMC dean and in-charge of Covid hospitals Dr S M Bandekar said that there are 150 patients on ventilator support. “This is the scenario because people are coming in late,” he said. “So, my humble request is please get tested immediately if you have symptoms. Things turn difficult once a patient is on a ventilator,” he said. “Early cure of the disease is the better solution.” In the past five days, 112 people have succumbed to the infection, and a senior health official said that none of the Covid deaths reported so far had been vaccinated. Even as the government proclaims that it is doing its best to contain the virus, the state, as on Monday, has over 15,000 active cases. Rane, in a series of tweets, said that he would meet CM Pramod Sawant to discuss what stringent measures would be put in place. “In addition to the measures, Goa needs to go under lockdown along the lines of other states like Maharashtra and Karnataka for a particular period. More than economic activities, the lives of the people matter,” he said. A week ago, however, Rane had told reporters that he does not believe in lockdown, and that the state government should introduce only those measures that it can effectively implement. Speaking to reporters after meeting Sawant, Bandekar, said, “Today we have more deaths, but most of them had come late and in a severe condition. There is nobody who has come early and died”. He said he has been repeatedly stating that people should immediately get tested soon after developing symptoms, so that treatment can be started. “Early cure of the disease When it was pointed out that patients could be presenting late because their test results are delayed, Bandekar said that the backlogs of the past few days have been cleared. "State epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar told this to us at the meeting," he said. Of the 38 deaths reported on Monday, three were declared brought dead to the hospital. A 67-year-old man from Sinquerim died within 20 minutes of admission, while a 77-year-old man from Aldona died 40 minutes after he was rushed to the North Goa district hospital. Seven people died less than 24 hours after they were admitted. In the majority of Monday's mortalities, patients were late in seeking treatment, and their average hospital stay was less than a week. They were detected with either respiratory failure, full-blown Covid pneumonia, or acute respiratory failure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-38-deaths-in-one-day-goa-sets-new-record/articleshow/82265711.cms||---

The stock is enough to refill 2,200 oxygen cylinders that would be despatched to the government and private hospitals treating critical Covid patients. The district administration officials were busy till late night, coordinating with the air force authorities for the second airlift of empty containers, which has been scheduled for Tuesday. “The tanker which was airlifted on Sunday by Gajraj, the IAF plane returned to Udaipur on Monday evening. This arrangement would save 18 to 20 hours time in oxygen supply to hospitals. The two-way road journey from Udaipur to Jamnagar plant, oxygen refill and unload time would in all take 44 hours in the normal course but through airlifting the empty containers, we are saving at least half the time,” collector Chetan Ram Deora told TOI. The officer said presently, the daily oxygen requirement is around 4,700 cylinders and we are sourcing them through various supplies including corporate and industrial units. Meanwhile, on Monday, Udaipur Marble Processors Samiti collected all the oxygen cylinders from various processing units and handed it to the administration for medical usage. Samiti president Banna Ram Chaudhary said oxygen is very essential for marble processing units, however, looking at the present situation, saving human lives is more important. The association also offered its office building to be converted into Covid-dedicated centre for patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/airlifted-o2-tanker-returns-fully-loaded-to-udaipur-in-a-day/articleshow/82268282.cms||---

The stock is enough to refill 2,200 oxygen cylinders that would be despatched to the government and private hospitals treating critical Covid patients. The district administration officials were busy till late night, coordinating with the air force authorities for the second airlift of empty containers, which has been scheduled for Tuesday. “The tanker which was airlifted on Sunday by Gajraj, the IAF plane returned to Udaipur on Monday evening.

This was found in the samples collected from the state in the first week of April. Apart from the double mutant virus, the new strain of UK and South African viruses have also been found in the state. “From the samples collected, 40% have been detected with the serious mutant virus in different parts of the state. Among this, 30% was the deadly UK strain and 7% was double mutant virus. The remaining was the South African strain of the virus,” said the chief minister. He said that the experts have observed that these deadly mutant viruses have spread across the state. The experts say that the spike in the cases is due to the strengthening of this mutant virus among the people and it has now spread in all districts. The UK strain has been much found in the northern districts, he added. The chief minister said there is every chance of the state witnessing a massive spread like the north Indian states since the mutant virus has been strengthened in the state. The spread will be at a rapid pace and hence the people will have to be very careful, he added. To find out whether any variation has occurred in strains of SARS-CoV-2 in Kerala and whether this is the reason behind the surge in the caseload here, the state health department had started sending samples to CSIR Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology for testing from January. The samples were collected from all the 14 districts for this study. In the first three months, it had completed sequencing of over 700 genomes from the state and it was done to identify the patterns of evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the state using genome sequencing approaches. The analysis did not suggest anything alarming. Of the genomes, a small subset of genomes had the N440K variant which has been previously found in large numbers (~30%) in the state of Andhra Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/presence-of-double-mutant-virus-found-in-state-cm/articleshow/82263458.cms||---

He has said Gurgaon and Faridabad have the most number of Covid cases and around 40 per cent of the total caseload in Haryana is in Gurgaon alone. “And due to private medical facilities in Gurgaon, a large number of patients from Delhi and other states are also coming to the city for treatment. Also due to non-availability of beds in Delhi hospitals, people are taking their family members to hospitals of Gurgaon, Rewari, Narnaul and other parts of Haryana,” he said, adding that more supply will be needed to match the demand. Recently, the daily quota of oxygen for Gurgaon was increased from 15 to 35 metric tonnes. But for Rewari, it was reduced from 5 to 3 metric tonnes. “...The quota allocated to Haryana is not enough and I have written to the Union government requesting to increase the quota for Haryana,” he said. On Monday, Singh approached the committee, constituted by the Union government, which is allocating quota of oxygen to states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/mp-seeks-more-oxygen-for-haryana/articleshow/82265743.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh

---||Hyderabad||Glitch in O2 supply kills 2 Covid patients in AP hosp||Vizianagaram: Two Covid-19 patients died, reportedly due to fluctuation in oxygen supply in the isolation ward of the Maharaja Government Hospital at Vizianagaram in Andhra Pradesh in the early hours of Monday. The fluctuation, suspected to have been caused by a technical snag in the hospital’s oxygen supply system, led to a few critical patients being shifted to nearby private hospitals. Collector M Hari Jawahar Lal and senior health officials of the district immediately rushed to the spot to calm down angry relatives of the deceased patients and worried family members of the critical ones. They also made arrangements to shift the critical patients to the private hospitals besides summoning the maintenance staff and technicians to check and repair the glitch. Around 290 Covid patients were being treated at the hospital, including 97 in the isolation ward, at the time of the mishap. The district administration recently expanded the hospital’s capacity by setting up 200 additional beds with oxygen and ventilator facility. When the reported glitch happened in the isolation ward between 3 and 3.30 am, around 15 patients were on high pressure oxygen supply due to their critical condition. The district collector, however, said the two patients did not die due to disruption in oxygen supply. “They were already critical and died due to other reasons. We shifted the other patients to two private hospitals. We have kept ready ambulances with ventilators to shift the patients to Visakhapatnam if there is any emergency and have asked the Vizag collector to keep some beds ready at the NRI hospital there. Meanwhile, the technical problem in oxygen supply system has been sorted out,” Jawahar Lal said. District medical and health officer S V Ramana Kumari told TOI that there is no shortage of oxygen in the hospital. “||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/glitch-in-o2-supply-kills-2-covid-patients-in-ap-hosp/articleshow/82265710.cms||Siva G

The decision was taken in the wake of unavailability and shortage of tocilizumab injection. Tocilizumab, an effective interlukin-6 inhibitor, has always been part of treatment protocol of Covid, which help treatment of cytokine release syndrome associated with the virus. Tocilizumab was originally approved for rheumatoid arthritis patients. In an order issued by the health department to all chief medical health officers across the state, the government informed that now itolizumab has been repurposed for Covid treatment. Phase-2 clinical trial of the drug done by a firm shows that key inflammatory markers IL-6, TNF alpha were presented to have reduced significantly with the drug thereby preventing hyper-inflammation in Covid patients. A health department official said the drug had also been approved by SMS Medical Colleges for replacement of tocilizumab due to its unavailability. Using of the drug for treatment of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome patients due to Covid. The health department sought demand of the drug from the CMHOs so that orders for procurement of the drug will be issued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/itolizumab-replaces-tocilizumab-for-treatment/articleshow/82264941.cms||Syed Intishab Ali
---||Kochi||Kochi: Authorities may take over low-key private hospitals||KOCHI: With the health department projecting a steep increase in the number of Covid-19 patients in the district within a week, authorities have chalked out measures for crushing the curve. This will necessitate huge augmentation of health infrastructure in the district within a short span which can be termed as running against time.  The live cases may increase to 72,000, almost double the number as on Sunday, by next week. “Normally, 15 out of 100 patients may require hospitalization while others will have no symptoms or mild symptoms and they can stay in their homes. If at least 10% of the patients require hospitalization, 7,200 hospital beds would be needed,” an official with the health department said. So, the authorities plan to set up more domiciliary care centres (DCCs) and Covid first-line treatment centres (CFLTCs). Besides, the authorities plan to set up another 1,000 oxygen beds in a fortnight. “There are allegations that the patients are not being sent to DCCs. Now, the district administration has informed it will constitute a mechanism for monitoring the shifting of patients to DCCs, CFLTCs and Covid hospitals,” sources said. The district administration also plans to take over low-key private hospitals. The health department has conducted talks with a private medical college and other two hospitals in this regard. The authorities will soon take over the private medical college. The ventilator facilities at the private medical college is very few and the health department plans to increase it to around 30 in a week and to 100 within a few days. As part of increasing the supply of medical oxygen, district collector S Suhas held talks with the manufacturers and suppliers. “A team, including officials with the health department and representatives of manufacturers, suppliers and private hospitals, will conduct inspections at the hospitals for ensuring that there is adequate stock of medical oxygen,” an official with the health department said. At the same time, the facilities in the government sector are not functioning at full throttle. According to the authorities, there are 100 beds for Covid patients who require tertiary care in the government medical college hospital (MCH). But the number of patients admitted in the MCH is 50. While the declared capacity at the district hospital at Aluva is 100, the occupancy is 44. There are also reports that dialysis facilities for Covid-19 patients are yet to be operational.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/authorities-may-take-over-low-key-private-hospitals/articleshow/82264064.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Goa||Goa: BJP continues its winning streak, wins 3 of 5 councils||PANAJI: With less than a year to go for the state assembly elections, BJP on Monday won three of the five municipal councils that recently went to polls. While it claimed the Quepem, Mormugao and Sanguem bodies, it lost the important Margao council, and in Mapusa, drew with the Congress-supported panel. “The mandate is in support of the government,” claimed state BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade. In Mapusa, the panel supported by BJP MLA Joshua D’Souza, the Mapusa development front, and the one supported by Congress candidate for the last assembly election, Sudhir Kandolkar, Mapsekaracho Ekvott, shared the spoils, winning nine wards each. While Kandolkar claimed the support of the two independent candidates to form the panel, BJP expressed confidence in forming the council. In Margao, the council will be formed jointly by Congress and Goa Forward Party. BJP’s attempts to wrest control of the commercial capital’s civic body proved futile, as BJP won just seven out of 25 seats. The last time around, it had won three. Despite BJP’s state brass camping in Margao, it was not able to take on the combined panel floated by Congress’ Digambar Kamat and Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco, and GFP’s Vijai Sardesai. It was a high-stakes battle in Margao. BJP’s leadership had put in a lot of effort and resources in their attempt to defeat the Kamat-Sardesai combine. State party president Sadanand Shet Tanavade himself camped there for days, and even CM Pramod Sawant campaigned for some candidates. A political observer said that BJP tried hard, but their efforts seemed to have failed to convince the voters. The court setting aside the reservation notification for Margao municipal elections in March was also a setback to the party. Party functionary Sharmad Raiturcar also suffered a defeat from the Comba ward of Margao. “The result of the Margao election has sent a clear signal that a united opposition can change political equations in the near future,” he said. “We have improved our tally in Margao,” Sawant said, adding that out of 14 municipalities, BJP has won 12. In Quepem, the panel backed by deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar swept the polls. A political observer said that Kavlekar was able to retain his hold on the municipality even after he defected to BJP, and despite there being many minority voters. In Sanguem, former MLA Subhash Phal Desai-backed BJP panel was able to win the polls despite the constituency being represented by independent Prasad Gaonkar. There was a triangular fight as Kavlekar’s wife and Congress candidate for the 2017 assembly election, Savitri, also fielded a panel, but was not able to garner support. A political observer said that this victory has given Phal Desai another opportunity to revive his political career for the upcoming assembly election. “Looking at the Sanguem results, Phal Desai is emerging as an alternative,” he said. In the recently-concluded ZP election, Phal Desai won all seats. In Mormugao, too, BJP dominated. Local MLA and urban development minister Milind Naik-backed candidates won seven wards, those backed by Vasco MLA Carlos Almeida won nine wards, and Dabolim MLA and transport minister Mauvin Godinho-backed candidates won in three wards. “Since 2012, BJP has been dominating in Mormugao taluka, and with weak Congress presence, the saffron party has again been able to perform well,” said an observer. Last month, BJP had won six out of seven urban local bodies, including the Corporation of the City of Panaji. In December 2020, BJP had retained its sway over both the zilla panchayat bodies of the state with a comfortable majority. BJP won 14 of the 24 seats of the South Goa zilla panchayat, and 19 of the 25 seats in North Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-continues-its-winning-streak-wins-3-of-5-councils/articleshow/82265731.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad firm gets nod for Covid antidote VINCOV-19 trials||HYDERABAD: Immunologicals player VINS Bioproducts Ltd on Monday said it has received approval from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) for conducting clinical trials of its Covid-19 antidote VINCOV-19. The phase I and II trials for VINCOV-19, developed in collaboration with the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) and the University of Hyderabad (UoH), will be conducted on around 300 volunteers nationwide at three hospitals across the country. One hospital each will be selected in the north, south and in Mumbai in the west zone, VINS Bioproducts CEO Siddharth Daga told TOI. The company said that the pre-clinical trials of VINCOV-19, which commenced in October 2020 and were conducted on rodents and non-rodents, were successful. It was able to produce F(ab’)2 polyclonal antibodies that showed high Covid-19 neutralising capacity. “The toxicity and pharmacokinetics studies were conducted at CCMB’s lab,” he said. VINCOV-19 was developed by immunising horses with the spike glycoprotein of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus and then synthesising the antisera (blood serum containing antibodies) obtained from the immunised horses. The antisera is to be injected into humans infected with Covid-19 to neutralise the virus. “The safety and efficacy of the antibodies will be examined in a group of around 300 Covid-19 patients. The clinical plan is to administer this hyperimmune serum to patients with moderate to severe disease according to the published Covid-19 treatment guidelines as soon as they are detected positive,” the company said. Since neutralizing antibodies could block the internalisation of SARS-CoV-2 to lung cells, the company said the antidote would give the maximum clinical benefits if it is administered at the early stages of the disease. While CCMB developed the viral antigen, UoH helped with the product characterisation and VINS Bioproducts carried out the equine immunisation and clinical development at its manufacturing facility in Telangana. Set up in 1997, VINS Bioproducts develops life-saving antisera against snake and scorpion bites as well as tetanus, diphtheria, gangrene antitoxins and rabies immunoglobulins. The company supplies to over 70 countries as well as international organisations like the World Health Organisation, United Nations International Children’s Fund and United Nations Development Programme. It has two manufacturing facilities spread over 12 acres as well as a 150-acre equine farm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-firm-gets-nod-for-covid-antidote-vincov-19-trials/articleshow/82265733.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Goa||Goa’s KTC suspends 27 buses to Karnataka||PANAJI: Soon after Karnataka announced a 14-day statewide closedown to tackle the spread of coronavirus, in the second wave of the pandemic, Goa’s Kadamba Transport Corporation Limited (KTC) has suspended 27 of its buses that ply between the two states. These buses travel to Belagavi, Bijapur, Hospet, Bengaluru and Karwar among other areas. “We cannot send our buses to Karnataka when there is a lockdown there. Even the state transport buses run by Karnataka will not enter Goa owing to the temporary suspension of transport,” said KTC managing director, Derek Pereira Neto. He further stated that despite operating 27 buses between Goa and Karnataka, there has been a decrease in passenger footfalls owing to the rising Covid cases in the second wave. “In recent days, not many people have travelled to Karnataka, and even in Goa, very less tourists from there have been coming from here,” he added. The KTC buses scheduled for travel on Monday, completed the journey and are returning to Goa, the KTC managing director said. Private buses for now, however, said that their services may ply interstate. Even on Monday, their buses operated between the two states. “As long as passengers have a Covid-19 negative certificate and we have a vehicle permit to travel interstate, the bus service will continue. We will, however, take all precautions and maintain social distance inside the bus to ensure that the SOPs are followed,” ticket booking staff at Paulo Travels said. Sources from private bus operator, Seabird Tourist Travels, said that they have not yet bcancelled any of their buses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ktc-suspends-27-buses-to-karnataka/articleshow/82265736.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Mumbai||Mumbai City’s poor stare at joblessness & hunger||Mumbai: Thirty-year-old Samir Shaikh had found work in a denim factory at Vashi just before the second wave of the pandemic. Soon after restrictions were first announced on April 5, it shut. “It was the only stable job I had,” said Shaikh who used to work as a waiter at wedding events for a few months each year and then double up as a daily wager on construction sites. A migrant from Banda in Uttar Pradesh, Shaikh has no savings to return home. “I have not been able to send money home since March. I am coping by borrowing from relatives,” says the resident of Mankhurd transit camp. The restrictions introduced to control the pandemic in endemic states have set off a wave of unemployment and hunger among the poor: A dystopia unfolding alongside desperation for beds, oxygen and Covid-19 fatalities. As shops, markets and restaurants stay closed, the urban unemployment rate in India has been on the upswing. From 7.2% on April 4, it rose to 9% by April 24th, according to CMIE data. Twenty-four-year-old Shafiq Choudhary who stays in a slum in Mandala, is down to one meal a day. “I have not earned for three weeks. I share food with my neighbours,” says Choudhary who hails from Basti district in UP. He is a daily wager who used to lift heavy loads in shops, markets or construction sites. Like many around him in the M-East Ward—among the most deprived belts in Mumbai—Choudhary does not have a ration card. This makes it difficult for him to access the government’s food relief. The MVA government is offering 3 kilos of wheat and 2 kilos of rice free of cost for a month for those holding ration cards under National Food Security Act (NFSA). The Centre has also announced 5kg free wheat and rice for NFSA card holders in May and June. “Many migrants do not have ration cards. Also, they need cooked meals. Just wheat and rice is not enough. They will still need dal, oil and fuel for cooking,” says Umarbhai Shaikh from Ghar Bachao Ghar Banao Andolan. The state has also offered 2 lakh free Shiv Bhojan thalis for the state. “That entire quota can be consumed in Mankhurd alone,” says Umarbhai. This time, the curbs have been more difficult for the poor because the food distribution by NGOs in slums has also dipped. “Firstly, daily wagers have no savings because they went through a lockdown last year. Also, this year the state does not have relief camps and NGOs have exhausted their funds. Large corporates have opted to donate to the PM Cares Fund or health infrastructure,” says Arun Kumar, CEO of Apnalaya which works in Mumbai’s slums. State food and civil supplies secretary Vilas Patil said the portability of ration cards under the One Nation One Ration Card scheme allowed migrants from other states to access grains here. “Over the last year, 3,000 migrants from other states got grains in Maharashtra, And 86 lakh beneficiaries were able to claim their ration from cards within the districts of Maharashtra,” he says. A survey conducted by Apnalaya among 864 households in M-East Ward in December 2020, though, found 25% of the households did not have ration cards. Sixty per cent were daily wagers. “The question is, over the last year, what has the government done to improve their access to social safety nets like ration cards and registration for government schemes?” asks Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-citys-poor-stare-at-joblessness-hunger/articleshow/82263541.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

People who had booked online and received time slots started arriving early fearing that vaccine stock would be exhausted before the scheduled time slot. The crowding caught the district administration unawares as no plan was put in place for queue management and crowd regulation. The health team inside the centre were also scarcely prepared to deal with the chaos. People, tired and frustrated from waiting in the queue, expressed anger and disappointment. As some of the people in the queue fainted from long wait in the heat, they had to be taken to hospitals. Police also arrived at the centre to regulate the crowd. A total of 2,000 doses were to be administered by five sections at the centre on Monday. “We had managed similar crowd without any issue in the past. The people were panicked apparently being apprehensive of vaccine stock getting over. Even those who had slots scheduled in the evening arrived by morning which resulted in crowding,” a health official said. The incident forced the district health team and district administration to put in place a proper queue management system from Tuesday. Entry to the vaccination centre will be regulated in accordance with the time slot. Besides arrangements will be put in place for the people to rest while waiting for inoculation. While the authorities said people panicked and led to chaotic situation at vaccination centre, some of the people in the queue complained of insensitive approach from the district administration and authorities. “They made us wait for hours. We couldn’t even go and drink water since others would occupy the spot. While arranging 2,000 doses there was hardly any system for crowd regulation,” a person said. Elderly people who got tired after being in the queue rang up their relatives who brought water for them. The authorities maintained that the centre functions from 9am to 3pm and all those who arrive according to time slot will be properly vaccinated. Union minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan said the crowding at the vaccination centre in the capital city was a matter of shame to the entire state. “Elderly women fainted and people were pleading for water after being in the queue for hours, it was condemnable,” said Muraleedharan. District collector Navjot Khosa’s Facebook post following the incident at vaccination centre also drew sharp response from the public. “Madam, I came with my mother for vaccination and we toiled a lot. The officials came there only when the media reported the situation there,” one of the persons commented. The people also drew comparisons with previous collectors as to how they handled crisis and also cited examples of better management from other states. The collector wrote on Facebook that taking vaccinations at the allotted time and date is one of the ways they can support this machinery. “We are getting vaccines on a timely basis and hence there is no need to panic,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/vax-centre-at-indoor-stadium-witnesses-chaotic-scenes/articleshow/82264104.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala: Shortage of blood expected; plan to overcome crisis mooted||KOCHI: Availability of blood for transfusion may be hit from May 1 when vaccination for those in the age group of 18-45 begins. Once vaccinated, a person can donate blood only after 28 days as per the norms prevailing in the country. The availability of blood for transfusion has decreased post Covid-19. There may be a further decline in the availability of blood once the vaccination for youngsters begins. Those in the 18-40 age group comprise the main chunk of donors. Shortage of blood is already reported from many places like Kochi, Thrissur and Kozhikode. “In the past few days, we had been facing acute shortage of blood. Then, we started approaching volunteer groups and organizations who regularly conduct blood donation camps. On Sunday, we got 108 units of blood,” said Dr N Vijayakumar, medical officer-in-charge, blood bank, Aluva district hospital. “Now, we have requested those ready to donate blood to come over only after a few days. The shelf life of blood is just 42 days. If all the donors come in a short span, the shelf life of all the units will end simultaneously. This will cause further shortage,” he added. According to officials with the health department, they have already given instructions to all blood banks in the state to start measures to increase the number of blood units with them. “As of now, there isn’t any shortage of blood in the state. Still, there may be a shortage in the coming days. So, we have given instructions to the blood banks to conduct more inhouse blood donation camps,” said Dr R Ramesh, project director, Kerala State AIDS Control Society (KSACS). “We have started campaigns for conducting pre-vaccination blood donations,” he added. In Thiruvananthapuram, donation camps are being conducted on a regular basis to overcome the shortage of blood anticipated in the coming days. “We have already contacted various groups, organizations, youths’ outfits, etc, which promote blood donation camps. We have requested them to donate at regular intervals. We have commitments from such groups for the next 15 days,” said Dr Sajith Vilambil, associate professor, blood transfusion, Government medical college, Thiruvananthapuram. Similarly, major healthcare institutions in the country are also organizing such camps. “Now, we have got commitments from various organizations to donate at least 15 units every day. This will help meet our demand,” an official with Malabar Cancer Centre said. At the same time, the restrictions imposed by the National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC) for donating blood before completing 28 days after vaccination is being challenged by doctors. “In the US, there is no deferral for blood transfusion for even a single day after vaccination. In Canada, it is just 7 days. We don’t understand why the NBTC has come up with 28 days deferral,” a doctor with a blood bank said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/shortage-of-blood-expected-plan-to-overcome-crisis-mooted/articleshow/82263490.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Kolkata||Firhad on 2-wheeler feels poll-day pulse||Kolkata: Peace was shattered at Kolkata Port assembly constituency at the fag end of polling on Monday when there was a pitched battle between the workers of Trinamool Congress and Congress at Garden Reach School. Both the parties claimed that their supporters were injured. Senior police officers rushed to the spot and a huge police force was deployed in the area. Cops said sticks and brickbats were found and the camps of both the parties were vandalised. Firhad Hakim, however, left the place immediately to avoid any tension in the area. Earlier in the morning, outgoing urban development minister Hakim alleged that his rival candidate Mohammed Mukhtar had snatched the voters’ identity cards at Batikal and those people could not cast their votes. In fact, riding a scooterette through narrow bylanes, Hakim tried to reach the spot, from where complaints were pouring in. But Mukhtar apparently left the place before Hakim reached there. Mukhtar, however, described his rival’s allegation as being “without any basis”. Even if the peace could somehow be restored, what became the biggest challenge was maintaining the safe-distancing and Covid-appropriate behaviour. Voters were seen standing in queues close to each other. At KMC Borough 15 booth, at least six people were seen in the gap between two circles. The central force and cops were busy driving away curious onlookers rather than enforcing safe physical distancing. Scenes were the same at Ramnagar, Bhukailash, Kabitirtha, Watgunge and Dent Mission Row. In the Kolkata Port constituency, where the poll battle is between the Trinamool Congress heavyweight Hakim and Congress candidate Mukhtar, over 40% of the 2,35,854 voters belong to the Hindi-speaking minority community. Throughout the day, the BJP candidate, Awadh Kishore Gupta, was missing in the area. Hakim exuded confidence and said: “My battle is with myself to score higher as a candidate and to perform better as people’s representative.” However, the BJP’s presence could be felt in the afternoon when Hakim was on his way to cast his vote at his locality, Chetla, that falls under Bhowanipore constituency. On his way back home, he stopped over at Trinamool camps to “express his gratitude” to them. “They worked relentlessly to make sure that their party candidate wins,” said Hakim. As he got down from his car and pat some Trinamool Congress workers at the camp on Hide Road near the flyover connecting Garden Reach with Majerhat, some BJP supporters reportedly shouted ‘Jai Sri Ram’ chants. Hakim, who seldom loses his cool, only smiled back at them before boarding his car. Later he said that the supporters of his rival party kept provoking even on the poll day, which is not the culture of Bengal politics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/firhad-on-2-wheeler-feels-poll-day-pulse/articleshow/82264119.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

In another development, Covid-19 positive cases on Monday declined to below 6,000 after 10 days. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI that the mobile lab will begin with 500 tests per day and go up to 2,000 in phases. “The NMC will increase one counter for swab collection at the six RT-PCR testing centres and also start six new centres from Thursday. Another six will start later,” he said. Union minister Nitin Gadkari had facilitated bringing the SpiceHealth lab from New Delhi. It will be stationed at the Suresh Bhat auditorium for now as it requires power supply. Gadkari had announced that testing will cost Rs 350 and results will be given within four hours. The state government has entered into an MoU with SpiceHealth and will pay the testing cost. It will be free for everyone. NMC sources told TOI that officials of SpiceHealth have “orally committed to provide results within six hours”. “On paper, they have mentioned that it would be within 24 hours. The exact time frame will be known when they start testing,” said the sources. The government-run laboratories used to provide results within 8-24 hours and privates ones within 4-12 hours before the second wave. The timings are now 24-48 hours since April. SpiceHealth will not provide results directly to people. The existing system of the NMC where patients collect their report from the collection centres will continue. The district on Monday registered 5,852 cases which were 1,919 cases less compared with 7,771 recorded a day ago. Cases declined below 6,000 after 10 days. This was probably because only 18,997 samples were tested on Monday as against the average of 24,000 per day. NMC officials said the number of tests seemed less on Monday due to the weekend. “We will have to observe tests and cases for one week or more to check for decline in positivity rate,” they said. The district has registered 1,53,942 cases in 26 days of April, which is two times of what was recorded in March and three times of September last year — peak of the first wave. The NMC on Monday proposed to set up a Covid Care Centre (CCC) or Dedicated Covid Health Centre (DCHC) with oxygen beds in Agrasen Bhavan at Ravi Nagar and Gandhibagh. The move is to also provide beds for patients coming to the city from other districts of Vidarbha. A fortnight ago, the NMC had proposed to start Covid hospitals at KT Nagar and Pachpaoli women’s hospital but are yet to complete the works. Also awaited is operating of CCCs with oxygen beds at Gittikhadan Hall and Symbiosis Recreation Centre that were proposed a week ago. The plan to start Covid hospitals at Ayurvedic College, ESIC hospital, Mulak Ayurvedic College, Haj House etc around two weeks ago is yet to be processed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/more-tests-from-thursday-as-mobile-lab-parks-at-bhat/articleshow/82264946.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The deceased were identified as Gulzar Begum (58), the accused’s mother, his sister Karimunnisa (29) and younger brother Mohammad Rafi (27). Proddatur sub-division DSP Prasad Rao said the incident happened early on Monday when the victims were asleep. “Accused Vuppuluru Karimullah (30), the eldest amongst the siblings, had developed a grudge against his family members over a property dispute. The tipping point came after his family members used abusive words for his wife and questioned her fidelity,” Rao told TOI All of victims were killed in cold blood, one by one. Police officials suspect there was a long-standing dispute in the family which may have led to the killings. Karimullah, police said, was also going through some marital dispute with his wife and had sought his family’s support to resolve the issue. However, they reportedly refused to intervene, which further soured their relationship. On Monday night, a few hours before the start of Ramzan fast, the unsuspecting family members were deep in sleep in their respective rooms when Karimullah entered with the chutney pounder. He first smashed his mother’s head, followed by his sister and brother. Locals came running after hearing their screams and also informed the cops. After committing the murders, Karimullah did not attempt to escape and surrendered when the police arrived. A murder case has been registered under section 302 of IPC at Proddatur urban police station. The bodies have been sent to the local government hospital for post-mortem. Cops are still interrogating Karimullah to ascertain the exact motive behind the murders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ap-man-bludgeons-mother-siblings-to-death-with-pounder/articleshow/82265744.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Both sides claimed to have the numbers to run the council. “The independent candidates (Anand Bhaidkar and Prakash Bhivshet) have extended support to our panel,” said the Kandolkar panel. However, BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade said that his party would form the panel. Out of 20 wards, the two sides won nine each. While Mapsekaracho Ekvott contested 16 seats, BJP contested all 20. A political observer said that considering the next assembly election, BJP has to plan a new strategy to hold on to the Mapusa constituency, which has been a BJP stronghold former deputy chief minister Francis D’Souza, the current MLA’s father, represented it. After his death, BJP had intended to field Kandolkar, a former Francis supporter, for the byelection, but due to “political compulsions”, the saffron party fielded his son Joshua as candidate. Kandolkar put up a tough fight against Joshua, but he lost the election. “I thank the people of Mapusa,” said Kandolkar, who said the people have voted for development and trust. He said that there has been no development in Mapusa for the past 25 years, and now people have given us the mandate. “We will work hard to resolve the issues of Mapusa,” he said. “I assured the people of Mapusa that we will work to start a sewage treatment plant, and by the next Ganesh Chathurti, idols will be immersed in clean water.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/independents-hold-key-to-mapusa-council-formation/articleshow/82265737.cms||---

In the petition filed by advocate C P Pramod, state secretary of All India Lawyers Union (AILU), it is contended that the central government is bound to provide universal immunization to mitigate Covid-19, which is a disaster that falls under Disaster Management Act, as universal immunization is the only remedy. Another demand of the petitioner is a court directive to the central government to adhere to National Vaccination Policy (NVP) in the matter of procurement of Covid vaccines. According to the petitioner, the NVP requires the central government to procure the total vaccines required for the population. As an alternative, the petitioner seeks a court declaration that the new vaccination policy, liberalised pricing and accelerated national Covid-19 vaccination strategy, to the extent it prescribes and permits different pricings for central and state governments as unconstitutional. Yet another demand of the petitioner is to declare as unconstitutional the portion of the new vaccination policy that excludes those aged below 45 years from vaccination from vaccination centres of the central government and only includes healthcare workers, frontline workers, and those above 45 years of age. An admission hearing on the petition is expected on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/quash-centres-new-vaccination-policy-plea-in-hc/articleshow/82263504.cms||---

The first tribal panchayat in Edamalakkudy and the tribal hamlets in Marayoor and Chinnar banned entry of outsiders. A meeting of the tribe heads and Vana Samrakshana Samithy (VSS) officials in Marayoor region on Sunday decided to implement the ban on outsiders till May 10. Sometimes the decisions of the tribal council (oorukoottom) had often landed in controversies as social boycott (ooruvilakku) of a family or its member is often given the punishment for violating the norms of the tribal community. But the tribal community’s decision is helpful to prevent Covid-19 within the community. Eravikulam National Park is the entry point of Edamalakkudy, the first tribal panchayat. “The tribe head from Parappayarkudy, one of the hamlets in Edamalakkudy, requested us to ban the entry of outsiders in Edamalakkudy. The forest department has already banned outsider’s entry to Edamalakkudy,” said Eravikulam National Park range officer Job J Neriamparampil. Edamalakkudy VSS secretary Ramesh said that the tribespeople in Edamalakkudy are following self isolation to prevent the spread of the virus. “The tribespeople venture out only for emergency needs. From the first wave of Covid pandemic, the tribal community in the panchayat have been following strict protocol and it will continue,” said Ramesh. In Marayoor, many tribal communities are living inside Chinnar wildlife sanctuary and Marayoor sandal division. The tribe heads meeting on Sunday decided to temporarily stop all construction activities inside the tribal hamlets. The people venture out of the hamlets only in emergency needs and do not spend time in town areas, said officials. Marayur range officer MG Vinod Kumar said that a decision was taken by the tribal council on Sunday that no one from outside would be allowed inside the hamlets. “In Koodalkattukudy, where nearly 600 tribespeople live, no Covid-19 cases were reported, and a decision in this regard was taken last year,” he said. Sheeja, a teacher of the multi grade learning centres (MGLC) in Marayoor, said that the decision of tribal community is applicable to all people within each tribal hamlet. “The tribe heads meeting is a powerful body within the community. The decision to curb the entry of outsiders will be helpful to prevent the spread of the virus in the community,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tribespeople-in-self-isolation-mode-once-again/articleshow/82263521.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Hyderabad||HC faults govt, stays T med council poll||Hyderabad: Seeking to know why the state government was trying to ‘meddle’ in the affairs of a professional body like the Telangana State Medical Council (TSMC), the high court on Monday stayed the ensuing election to the executive committee of the council. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy said the state was not only aiming at having a say in the affairs of the council, but was also trying to ensure that only its word would prevail. The bench was hearing a petition filed by Dr B Arundhati who questioned the GO (No. 68) issued by the health department that reduced the number of elected representatives in the council. “The number of nominated members was not reduced. This will tilt the balance in favour of the state in running the council,” the petitioners contended. The number of elected representatives was reduced from 13 to five. “While the number of nominated members was left untouched, whoever wins the popular vote will also be rendered helpless because the number of nominated members will dominate the elected members,” they argued. Appearing for the state government, additional advocate general J Ramachandra Rao said section 101 of the AP Reorganisation Act gave them the powers to reconstitute the council. “We reduced the representation of elected medical doctors because after the bifurcation of the state, the number of doctors remaining in Telangana has also come down,” he said. The bench then asked him as to why the number of nominated members too was not brought down proportionally. “This is no way to interpret section 101 of the Reorganisation Act,” the bench said. Sama Sandeep Reddy, counsel for the petitioners, said the action of the state was in contravention of section 3(2) of the AP Medical Practitioners Act. Though the state counsel argued that they have powers to do so, the bench told him what was lacking in the current case is not power, but rationale and stayed the election process of the executive committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-faults-govt-stays-t-med-council-poll/articleshow/82265750.cms||---
---||Surat||Surat: Three saved from Covid hospital fire die||SURAT: Tragedy struck at Ayush Hospital, a dedicated Covid-19 facility, when fire broke out in the ICU which led to evacuation of critical patients leading in three deaths on Sunday night. Preliminary investigation revealed that the fire started due to a short circuit in the air conditioner which led to the ICU being filled with smoke. Total 19 patients, who were on ventilators, were immediately shifted to different hospitals. But three patients died after being shifted to a nearby hospital. The hospital is situated on the fifth floor of Param Doctor House in Lal Darwaja area. Police have started inquiry into incident and further actions will be taken after the report of the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) arrives, informed sources. Raju Patel, 52, Arvind Singala, 45, and Ramji Lukhi, 60, died after being shifted to Sanjivani Hospital. “Condition of few of the patients was critical and they might have died during the shifting process due to irregular oxygen supply. The fire started due to a short circuit in AC and our staff immediately controlled it but the patients had to be shifted due to the ICU getting filled up with smoke,” said Dr Ghanshyam Patel, who runs the hospital. “Due to the short circuit the electricity supply got disconnected due to which ventilators also stopped working and the patients were given oxygen manually,” Dr Patel added. Surat Fire and Emergency Services (SFES) received a call at 11.30 pm after which 14 fire tenders were rushed to the spot. “The fire was a minor one and it was controlled by the hospital staff. We doused it completely and rescued 12 patients from ICU who were immediately shifted to other hospitals,” said a fire official. “There was life threatening smoke in the ICU. The fire could have occurred due to short circuit or overloading since the AC must have been in use continuously for many days now,” the official added. According to police, total 18 patients were admitted in the ICU while in the hospital 60 patients were under treatment. All the patients were shifted to different hospitals after the incident. Initially some patients were taken to the terrace as well to protect their lives. “Police started a preliminary investigation of the case and we are registering statements of the staff and doctors. Police have recovered the CCTV footage as well in which it is seen that the hospital staff controlled the fire immediately,” said an officer of Mahidharpura police station. Police found from the CCTV footage that the fire started in AC above bed number 3 after a spark. The hospital staff used a fire extinguisher and controlled it but the fire had created a lot of smoke, police informed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/3-saved-from-covid-hospital-fire-die/articleshow/82264969.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Congress finds success in Margao after alliance with Goa Forward Party||MARGAO: Congress and Goa Forward Party (GFP), which joined hands to form the Margao civic alliance for the civic polls, got the better of BJP by winning 17 of the 25 seats, thereby retaining their sway over the council.  If Fatorda MLA and GFP president Vijai Sardesai asserted his supremacy once again with his Fatorda Forward panel winning 8 of the 11 seats coming under Fatorda constituency and one under Curtorim, leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat turned out invincible in the battle for supremacy in the Margao constituency with his Model Margao panel winning 8 of the 11 seats. Though BJP managed to wrest three seats from GFP in Fatorda – GFP panel had won all 11 seats in the 2015 civic polls – it has landed itself in a pitiable situation ahead of the 2022 polls. Kamat also managed to better his performance in the Margao municipality by winning eight seats - two more than the 2015 polls tally – thereby putting to naught all efforts of the BJP to gain control of the council.  In the 2015 Margao civic polls, where Sardesai and Kamat had forged a similar alliance, six candidates were elected from Kamat’s panel while 11 from that of Sardesai panel emerged victorious. BJP had to be content with a victory in just four wards.  BJP which had to confine itself to the Opposition benches in the MMC for the last three terms, had gone to the voters this time with a manifesto described as a “reflection of the dreams of Madgavkars,” urging them to give it one chance to actualize the city’s aspirations. Chief minister Pramod Sawant had also descended on Margao for a whirlwind campaign during the last leg of the campaign. The efforts however proved to be inadequate to win the trust of the people. BJP suffered a shock defeat in ward 12 where the party’s senior functionary Sharmad Raiturkar lost to Model Margao’s candidate Sagun (Dada) Naik, albeit by a narrow margin of 12 votes. Raiturkar had twice contested against Kamat in the assembly elections. Deputy chief minister Manohar Azgaonkar managed to secure victory for her niece in ward 14. Ronita Azgaonkar, daughter of former MMC chairperson Rajendra Azgaonkar defeated Kamat-backed Sulaksha Jamuni of Model Margao. Shadow Council for Margao which had fielded candidates in 8 wards on its Citizens Choice panel, and Fatorda Congress block which had nominated six candidates in Fatorda failed to get a single seat. Kamat, speaking on the alliance’s victory, said that it was an indication of “beginning of end of the insensitive and irresponsible BJP government in the state.” “This government has pushed Goans under huge financial burden and are now pushing them in the death trap of Covid,” he said, even as he assured to work to make Margao an “ultra-modern city” as promised by his panel during the campaign. Sardesai said that by getting his candidates elected, “people have endorsed our politics, our development and our agenda.” “Our ‘Team Goa’ approach has paved the way forward for a United Goa. This alliance will continue to streamline in the future and unite all the people of Goa,” Sardesai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-finds-success-in-margao-after-alliance-with-gfp/articleshow/82265747.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

Rout flouted the Covid protocol of inviting more than 50 guests. Police gave him a clean chit and charged his father-in-law of violating the norm by imposing a penalty of Rs 25,000. The marriage ceremonies of Roat, MLA Chorasi, started a week ago in his native village Thothri Panchayat Samiti in Chorasi. The videos and images of the ceremonies were going viral in the region, which clearly points out violation, but failed to invite any action from the authorities. “The bride’s family has made elaborate arrangement for the stay and food for the marriage party which was ignored by the local administration. On Sunday morning, the marriage party reached Kushal Nagri village with 300 persons. The images again went viral in the region,” said a source. The local administration was alerted by locals after which the officials arrived at the spot. Since it was the marriage of an MLA, the officials slapped a penalty of Rs 25,000 on Mahipal Kharadi, father-in-law of the MLA.

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Liquor traders on strike today over guarantee fee||JAIPUR: Liquor traders who recently bought shops through e-auction have asked the state government to waive the guarantee fee imposed on booze sale. Following the state government’s orders, liquor shops can now operate between 6 am and 11 am. Traders said to earn the fixed guarantee fee through liquor sale is impossible in such a short time. Shopkeepers have decided to shut their shops if the government imposes guarantee fee. Raj Liquor Welfare Society president Nilesh Mewara said the excise department has given a mandatory target to sell certain quantity of liquor, based on last year sales. On this sale, the government imposes 45-50% of guarantee fee depending on the brand. It is compulsory for a shopkeeper to pay this fee. “For instance, if a trader purchased a shop for Rs 2 crore, the guarantee fee will be around Rs 1 crore. As per the provision, it is mandatory for a shopkeeper pay guarantee fee in installments in 12 months, else a penalty will be imposed,” he added. Traders alleged that it was a double whammy for businessmen. The government is not giving relaxation in penalty and allowing shopkeepers to open shops only for 5 hours. “We are ready to close our shops during the entire lockdown if government waives the guarantee fee. We are forced to open the shops to cover our losses,” said a shopkeeper. As a mark of protest, liquor traders across the state will go on strike on Tuesday demanding that the government should allow them to keep their shops open between 10 am and 8 pm. The memorandum submitted to excise commissioner reads, “The sale of liquor dipped by 30% after the curfew timing from 10am to 5pm was imposed . Losses were also incurred when shops completely were closed on Sunday and Saturday. The government should waive 100% guarantee fee for weekend curfew and 75% for other days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/liquor-traders-on-strike-today-over-guarantee-fee/articleshow/82264976.cms||---

The secretary said all complaints related to overpricing, profiteering and black-marketing were received on the state consumer helpline toll-free number 1800-180-6030. “During the ‘public discipline fortnight’, the district collectors should constitute a joint team of food department, legal metrology, police and food safety officers to monitor the supply of essential commodities and their pricing,” said Jain. “Instructions have been issued to the legal metrology officers to inspect minimum 3 grocery/departmental stores daily under the supervision of DSOs,” he added. “District collectors have been directed to get price list of the open food items being distributed by the retailer / grocery store pasted on the wall so that consumers can purchase essential commodities at right value,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/massive-crackdown-on-hoarding-of-food-items/articleshow/82264991.cms||---
---||Goa||Lockdown not solution, need strict curbs: Goa Inc||PANAJI: Health minister Vishwajit Rane’s call for a month-long lockdown in the state sent alarm bells ringing on Monday. Goa Inc quickly come out in support of chief minister Pramod Sawant who refused to send the state into a lockdown to curb the rise in Covid cases. Confederation of Indian Industry, Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Goa State Industries Association (GSIA) said that a lockdown is not the solution for the steep rise in covid-19 cases. Supporting the chief minister’s decision to keep economic activity rolling, captains of Goa’s industries have said that Goa needs to put in place stringent Covid protocols while also accelerating the vaccination drive. “Factories and shopfloors must be kept open for economic reasons so that production and supply chains are not disturbed. Work from home must be prescribed or followed wherever possible. In offices where this is not possible, it needs to be ensured that only one-third attendance of employees is permitted,” said chairman of CII-Goa Atul Jadhav. All the industry bodies have urged the state government to vaccinate all industry workers, employees, particularly those employed in the tourism sector and the logistics sector. GCCI president Manoj Caculo said that while the private sector has adhered to all Covid norms, it is the political class and social events that have failed to follow social distancing and use of masks. “It’s the uncontrolled social and political events that are responsible for the spread. Let the government put strict restrictions and control on them. Needless to say enforcement to control unwarranted movement is a must specially after working hours,” he said. GSIA president Damodar Kochkar agreed with Caculo and said that economic activity must be allowed to continue. “Industries right from day one are following all SOP’s to contain this pandemic. We have to keep the economic engine running or else we will face the other type of pandemic which this state and our country cannot afford,” said Kochkar. “Nobody forced people to attend melas, weddings, religious ceremonies or even go to vote. When entire world was taking precautions, we where going around as if corona is over and gone,” he added. All the three industry bodies said that responsible and conscious decisions have to be taken by everyone, from the government to every citizen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lockdown-not-solution-need-strict-curbs-goa-inc/articleshow/82265757.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: Prices of medical equipment surge||KOCHI: The rise in Covid-19 cases has led to an increase in the price of medical equipment like pulse oximeter, oxygen concentrator, thermometer, infrared thermal scanner, vaporizer, nebulizer, etc. Also, drug house owners said that a tendency of panic-buying is visible now as many have started hoarding these equipment fearing shortage. Due to the high demand, the prices of many equipment have increased and despite such surge in price, people are ready to buy those items. Druggists said that the government should fix a price range for all these goods to prevent overpricing. They said that many companies are now selling pulse oximeters and nebulizers and prices decided by them and most of such products do not even have warranty. Moreover, they said the government should make people aware to prevent panic buying of medical goods. “Even those who do not have any symptoms are now buying thermometers, vaporisers, pulse oximeters, etc. On Sunday, we received several calls making orders for them. Asked why they were buying all these in a hurry, they said they fear shortage of the items in the coming days. Such panic buying might affect the availability of particular goods and it will cause problems to those in real need. Moreover, the middlemen in sales of these good are making huge profits by overpricing the goods. Last year, the same issue happened in the case of sanitizer but the government intervened and announced a price range. Similar action should be done in the case of medical equipment too,” said a drug house owner in Ernakulam MG Road, on condition of anonymity. The sale of low quality devices and equipment is another concern. Fake or untested devices are now available in abundance on online platforms and people buy such items without checking their authenticity. Doctors advise people to ensure authentic devices as fake ones could give false results leading to unnecessary confusion about one’s health condition. “People should be beware of fake pulse oximeters as it might show false readings, which might lead to confusion and unnecessary hospital admission. While buying such things, you need to see if the device is approved by government of India or not, or tested to ensure accuracy. If buying online, it is ideal to take a look at the product’s ratings and customer reviews,” said Dr Tinku Joseph, chief interventional pulmonologist, Amrita Hospital, Kochi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/prices-of-medical-equipment-surge/articleshow/82263534.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

On Sunday, NIA recovered Mane’s red Hyundai Creta from Borivli, and a white Volkswagen Polo from Andheri. Both have fake registration number plates. The Polo, registered in the name of Yash Shah, is believed to have been used in Hiran’s murder. NIA also claimed to have found CCTV footage outside Kalwa railway station where arrested API Sachin Waze is seen buying a set of handkerchiefs from a hawker. Handkerchiefs were stuffed in Hiran’s mouth when his body was found in Mumbra creek on March 5. NIA has recorded the statement of the hawker. Mane was arrested on April 23 and remanded to police custody till April 28. Mane is the fifth person and fourth cop to be arrested in the case so far. Mane, during interrogations, admitted that on March 4 night, he, along with Waze, called up Hiran and asked him to come to Ghodbunder Road in Thane. Mane said he took Hiran in the car to Hotel Hill View on Ghodbunder Road and handed him over to Waze and other policemen. They then smothered Hiran in the moving car and dumped his body in Thane creek, Mane claimed. Sources said that all the three arrested cops--Waze, API Riyazuddin Kazi and Mane--have revealed the same sequence of events and have blamed a former high-profile cop who is likely to be summoned again this week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nia-seizes-2-cars-it-says-pi-mane-used-in-hiran-murder-plot/articleshow/82265760.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Jaipur||NGOs come forward to help patients in Jodhpur||JODHPUR: Amid shortage of hospital beds for Covid-19 patients, philanthropists and social organisations are coming forward with facilities of beds in the city sans medical resources. Two days ago, a proposal by Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, MP (Jodhpur) and Union cabinet minister to set up a 500-bed facility for Covid-19 patients at MBM Engineering College was given. Now, similar proposals have been forwarded to the district administration with different bed capacities. On Sunday, social worker Sharda Choudhary dedicated such a facility with 125 beds to the district administration to be set up at the Old Campus She has proposed to take the total bed capacity to 200 in the next few days once the patients are accommodated here. Pushkarna Youth Society has also offered a similar Covid care centre with 100 beds in Siwanchi Gate area. All other arrangements for treatment ranging from doctors and nursing staff to medical equipment are expected to be arranged by the administration. Shekhawat had also stated that the bed facility will be developed by his team and social workers and he had asked the administration to arrange for doctors and other medical staff along with medical equipment for the centre to become functional. Though, the administration has assured all to arrange for required resources for these centres but this seems a herculean task amidst growing pressure on resources at hospitals, leading to grave shortage. Given this limitation, the administration has not been able to launch the proposed Covid care centre at Boranada even after four days of its announcement. This facility is proposed to have 400 beds for Covid-19 patients. On the other hand, district administration has appealed to the public, philanthropists and social organisations to help with donation of oxygen cylinders, oxygen concentrators, oxygen generating units and medical beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ngos-come-forward-to-help-patients-in-jodhpur/articleshow/82265011.cms||---
---||Surat||Lockdowns in other states take a huge toll on Surat’s textile business||SURAT: Every year in April, Saumil Shah, a textile trader in Surat used to be busy with handling orders from other states and ensuring that the parcels are dispatched on time to different part of the country ahead of the marriage season. But this year, Shah’s business is down to 10% despite there being no lockdown in Gujarat. Shah, who runs his business from New Ambaji Market here, is not the only trader who is facing the brunt. Due to the lockdown in states like Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Delhi and self-imposed lockdown in some cities of Gujarat, textile trading in Surat has started to feel the heat. “The months of March, April and May are the ones when we do most of our business because we get orders from other states for the marriage season. Last year due to the lockdown there was no business, but we recovered during the festive season and hoped that 2021 would be much better. But all orders are getting cancelled now,” said Manoj Agarwal, president of Federation of Surat Textile Traders Association (FOSTTA). “We usually take 15-20 days to prepare the order and dispatch it. But during that period, lockdowns have been announced in the state from where we had got the order. So, the trader there cancels the entire order and we end up in helpless situation,” said Shah. While the traders’ orders are getting cancelled, the transporters too have stopped taking the booking. Before the pandemic, 400 trucks used to leave Surat daily for different states with textile goods, now that number has come down to just 70 to 80 trucks. “Even if traders in Surat want to dispatch the goods, it is becoming difficult for us to take the booking because our godowns in other states are filled to the capacity and there is no place to store more parcels,” said Yuvraj Desale, president of Surat Textile Goods Transport Association. “Because the markets in other states are closed due either to state-declared or self-imposed lockdown, traders are not picking goods from our godowns,” Desale added. Looking at the grim Covid-19 situation, the industry is not expecting recovery anytime soon. “Last year we faced losses of around Rs 15,000 crore. We are again in the same position this year. The cases are still increasing in states where our products used to be sold. So, we are not expecting any recovery before September,” said Champalal Bothra, general secretary of FOSTTA. After the virtual meeting of chief minister Vijay Rupani with business leaders last week, FOSTTA had written to the CM to declare a week’s lockdown. “The government has not declared any lockdown, but we are voluntarily keeping our businesses shut on weekends for the past three weeks,” said Agarwal. If the Covid-19 cases keep rising, the association may extend the weekend voluntary shutdown to next month too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/lockdowns-in-other-states-take-a-huge-toll-on-surats-textile-business/articleshow/82265051.cms||Jay Pachchigar
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Ministers, MLAs to donate month’s pay for free vaccination drive||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s decision to provide free vaccination to all above 18 years has boosted the morale of Congress workers and MLAs. Enthused by the decision, many ministers and MLAs pledged to donate their a month’s salary to the cause. Similar pledges are coming from party workers and common people. The state BJP also said they will not be found lagging, but will contribute towards the cause. Congress chief Govid Singh Dotasra in a tweet welcomed the decision. Honouring the sentiments of the state and respecting the demand of all the youths of Rajasthan, the chief minister took the historic decision to provide free vaccine to all youth aged between 18-45 years. Labour minister Tika Ram Jully, who pledged a month’s salary for vaccination, said citizens of the 18-45 age group will get free vaccine, which will help to prevent another wave of Covid. The minster in a letter to the chief minister expressed gratitude for the decision. Similar sentiments are being expressed by other party lawmakers. Deputy chief whip Mahendra Chaudhary said the chief minister had taken a big decision on vaccination and all MLAs would contribute their bit to the cause. He said no official decision was taken but MLAs are announcing it voluntarily. BJP president Satish Poonia, who had called for the state government to announce free vaccination while talking to TOI, said his party MLAs will also contribute to the cause. He said, “We had convened a meeting of party leaders and its MLAs will also contribute a month's salary towards vaccination.” The state government has to shell out around Rs 3,000 crore to vaccinate all the adults above 18 years. Such a huge amount could be allocated only with budget cuts, which will impact the allocation for welfare schemes and development work as the state government had already announced the budget for the year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ministers-mlas-to-donate-months-pay-for-free-vax-drive/articleshow/82265042.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Reunited leopard family gets separated again, reunited||Nagpur: In a repeat incident, Wildlife SOS and the forest department rescued a pair of male leopard cubs that were previously reunited with their mother in Otur village located in Junnar taluka of Pune in Maharashtra. The lost cubs were identified by their unique microchip number and were once again reunited with their mother. It turned out that the mother leopard had moved her cubs to a neighbouring sugarcane field after the successful reunion operation by Wildlife SOS and the forest department, earlier this month. Sugarcane farmers were gathering the last of their harvest when they stumbled upon the two leopard cubs in the field. The local communities living in the areas surrounding Junnar have been trained in preliminary rescue protocols as human-leopard interaction is very high. The farmers did not waste another second and reached out to the forest department, who were quick to reach the spot along with a team from the Wildlife SOS Leopard Rescue Center. Wildlife SOS veterinary doctor Nikhil Bangar conducted a thorough on-site medical examination and was surprised to find that they were the same cubs that were previously rescued by the team. Dr Bangar said, “We were able to identify them with the help of the microchips consisting of a unique identification number that was implanted before the first reunion operation.” Post-checkup, the team worked quickly and efficiently to set up an installation where the cubs were placed safely, close to where they were found. Camera traps set up by the team captured the mother leopard slowly approaching the field around midnight. Relieved to see her cubs safe and sound, she carefully lifted them by the scruff of the neck and relocated to a safer location. Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder and CEO of Wildlife SOS, said, “Wildlife SOS works closely with the forest department to raise awareness about these issues in man-leopard conflict-prone villages which have now brought about a considerable and positive change in the attitude of people towards leopards and other wild animals. In this month alone, our team has successfully reunited over 15 leopard cubs with their mothers.” Harvest season in Maharashtra often coincides with leopard cub season, which puts both humans and these elusive wild cats in a rather sensitive and conflicting situation. The sugarcane fields provide a suitable shelter for the leopards to breed in and to nurture their cubs, so chances of such encounters are higher during the pre-harvest and harvest seasons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/reunited-leopard-family-gets-separated-again-reunited/articleshow/82276374.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: 22 bodies stuffed into one van sets off public outrage||AURANGABAD: The bodies of 22 patients who died of Covid in Ambajogai in Maharashtra’s Beed district were stashed in a single ambulance —in some cases one upon the other — and transported to a crematorium. The incident sparked an outrage, forcing the Beed district administration to rush a team to Ambajogai, around 220km from here, to look into the matter. An eyewitness to the incident alleged that the police present near the ambulance snatched the mobile phones of at least two relatives of the deceased who were filming and clicking pictures of the bodies stuffed in the ambulance. Their phones were returned only after the last rites of the deceased were performed, he said. Officials said the 22 bodies, placed in body bags, were picked from the mortuary of the Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada Government Medical College (SRTMGMC) in Ambajogai and kept in the ambulance (MH-29/AT-0299). As per hospital records, the ambulance is a mobile ICU. Authorities said 14 of the 22 deceased had died on Saturday and the rest on Sunday. Nine had died at the Lokhandi Savargaon jumbo Covid centre. Beed district collector Ravindra Jagtap said, “I have ordered the Ambajogai additional collector to probe the matter. We will initiate action against anyone found guilty.” Another eyewitness, Abhijit Jagtap, confirmed to TOI that two relatives who had tried filming the bodies in the ambulance had their mobile phones taken away by the policemen around. “There are just two ambulances to carry dead bodies to the crematorium. We have demanded more ambulances. Our responsibility is to hand over bodies to the Ambajogai civic body to perform the last rites. What the civic body does is not in our control,” said SRTMGMC dean Dr Shivaji Sukre. Sukre said that as per an arrangement, the civic body collects bodies twice a day for cremation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/22-bodies-stuffed-into-one-van-sets-off-public-outrage/articleshow/82266992.cms||---

The heavy vehicles’ owners claimed that as there is no major demand for transportation apart from essential goods, their losses are increasing daily. “While it is true that trucks and other heavy vehicles are allowed free movement, it does little to help our condition as we are either plying edible goods or medical essentials which does not compensate for the real products which were transported regularly and were our main source of income. These include industrial goods like heavy machinery, construction materials and automobiles. As there is complete stop on these, there is no profit at all and we are just trying to make ends meet,” said Anil Arora, president, Jaipur Transport Operators’ Association. Another reason, which transporters said was causing losses, was lack of staff as majority of operators were working with only 50% employees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/transporters-suffer-losses-due-to-2-week-restrictions/articleshow/82265054.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu parties okay oxygen production at Sterlite plant but with conditions||CHENNAI: In view of the unabated Covid surge, an all-party meeting called by Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Monday okayed operation of the Sterlite plant at Tuticorin to produce medical-grade oxygen for four months, but with a slew of conditions. Electricity will be supplied by state-run power utility Tangedco, and not Sterlite’s own power plant, for four months and extended depending on the demand for oxygen. The unit will not be permitted to produce copper. A monitoring committee led by the collector and including representatives of public, environmental organisations and anti-Sterlite groups would be set up to oversee the functioning of the oxygen plant. “Oxygen produced in the unit should meet the requirements of Tamil Nadu, and the surplus alone could be sent to other states,” said a resolution passed at the all-party meeting called ahead of the Supreme Court hearing of Vedanta’s plea to open the unit to produce 1,000 tonnes of oxygen. The unit has remained shut since May 2018 after protests erupted over environmental concerns and resulted in 13 deaths in police firing. The government will convey the all-party decision to the Supreme Court in the form of an affidavit on Tuesday. This comes in the wake of Vedanta filing an additional affidavit to the court, claiming that it was beyond the competency and financial ability of the state government to run the oxygen plant. In a separate hearing in the high court on Monday, the Tamil Nadu government said Sterlite had oxygen production capacity of 1,050 tonnes a day but only 35 tonnes can be used for medical purposes. “We need liquid oxygen with 99.4% and above purity for medical use. Oxygen produced in Sterlite will have purity of only 92-93% as it was designed for industrial use,” advocate general Vijay Narayan said. This apart, Sterlite has to install compression and bottling plants to convert gaseous oxygen to liquid oxygen. It will take at least nine months to obtain approvals and commence production. If they manage to get the approvals immediately it will take six months to commence production, he added. However, when the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy resumed the hearing post lunch, the AG said t Sterlite had agreed to increase the production of liquid oxygen and to set up the compression and bottling plants as soon as possible. Recording the submissions, the bench said it did not want to go into the Sterlite issue as the Supreme Court was seized of the matter. In separate statements later, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami said the state was in challenging times given the shortage of oxygen, while DMK chief M K Stalin said the ‘toxic plant’ will not be opened under any circumstances after the DMK comes to power. Eight recognised parties -- the AIADMK, the DMK, the BJP, the Congress, the PMK, the DMDK, the CPM and the CPI—were invited to the meeting by the government. “A resolution has been passed to permit oxygen production for four months and it would be reviewed later. The produced oxygen should realize the requirements of Tamil Nadu first and the other states later,” DMK leader and Tuticorin MP Kanimozhi told reporters, emerging from the two-and-a-half-hour meeting.  BJP state president L Murugan said the arrangement was only temporary. “The produced oxygen should predominantly be used for Tamil Nadu,” the BJP leader said. In a statement, MDMK leader Vaiko said the state government could take over the Sterlite unit to produce oxygen. It could also avail the required engineers from the public-sector undertakings or the engineers of the Sterlite unit on a contract basis. “The management should never be allowed to operate on its own,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-parties-okay-oxygen-production-at-sterlite-plant-but-with-conditions/articleshow/82265080.cms||---

Notices were sent to housing societies to seal their premises in case of high prevalence of cases. M-West ward among the top three worst-hit wards in the city since February, but suddenly it witnessed a rapid drop in cases in the last 20 days. From 60 cases on February 20, the ward peaked on April 5 with 392 fresh cases, and on April 25, the number dropped to 143. In fact, M-West is now among the bottom three of the city’s 24 Covid-affected wards with a growth rate of 0.92%, much below’s Mumbai’s 1.17%. So what worked? Strict implementation of every lockdown rule, according to Dr Bhupendra Patil, medical health officer, M-West ward.“If you are in Chembur, you will actually feel that there is a lockdown when compared to any other ward in the city,” Dr Patil said. “M-West was among the first civic wards to file FIRs against individual persons for violating home quarantine rules and hosting weddings with hundreds of guests as well as sealing entire buildings with five or more positive Covid cases.” “We also formed teams to check if shops operated from the backdoor, whether sealed buildings were conforming to the rules and physically verify crowd control at weddings,” Dr Patil said, adding that the ward is now reporting less than 150 fresh cases for the past three days.The ward office had recently registered an FIR against Hotel Manas Residency in Chembur for allegedly allowing international flyers quarantined there to leave the premises and return on the seventh day when the BMC teams would come to inspect and test them. Chembur railway station was the best example to see in terms of how the lockdown was implemented in the ward, said local activist Rajkumar Sharma. “The otherwise bustling station area has not a single shop open. The ward officials have been very strict about sealing buildings while ensuring that essentials were delivered,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hotspot-chembur-turned-case-rate-around-in-20-days/articleshow/82265078.cms||Richa Pinto

Acting on a tip-off that one Arif Hussain was selling oxygen cylinders at higher prices, Faridpur SHO Surendra Singh Pachauri raided the accused’s house and seized seven oxygen cylinders, said police. Following the complaints from oxygen cylinder dealers that they have oxygen available for refilling, but there is a massive shortage of cylinders, the issue was raised with the district administration and police. Taking serious cognisance of the complaints, superintendent of police (city) Ravindra Kumar, who is also the acting SSP, had directed all SHOs to keep a tab on people involved in black marketing of the oxygen cylinders. Posing as a relative of a Covid patient, a police officer on Sunday evening approached Arif to negotiate the price of an oxygen cylinder, said police, adding that after bargaining, Arif agreed to give a cylinder at a price three times higher than the actual price. Thereafter, police raided the accused’s house and seized six large and one small oxygen cylinders, a gauge and other equipment, said police. The SP said, “We have booked Arif under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of a disease), 419 (cheating by impersonation) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of a property) of the Indian Penal Code and under relevant sections of the Disaster Management Act and the Epidemic Act.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-arrested-for-black-marketing-of-oxygen-cylinders-in-bareilly-seven-cylinders-seized/articleshow/82262343.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The big hospitals treating Covid-19 patients are managing with relatively sufficient or some with neck-to-neck oxygen supply but are unable to accommodate more beds with ventilator support. But small and medium-sized Covid hospitals have no option but to keep their ventilator-beds vacant for want of uninterrupted supply of medical-grade liquid oxygen, experts in the field said. There are 650 private hospitals in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) areas. Of those, 220 hospitals are treating Covid-19 patients. Barring 50 big hospitals that have huge storage tanks on their premises, the worst hit are the small and medium-sized hospitals dependent on a daily oxygen supply through jumbo cylinders. Currently, almost all big hospitals’ emergency department — the first point of entry from where patients get triaged — remains crowded with 15-20 Covid patients accommodated on recliners or beds put up outside the casualty ward or along corridors. Officials involved in the mitigation of the oxygen deficit said situation had started improving from April 25 (Sunday) with the drop in the daily caseload. Compared with the daily 7,000 cases in the PMC areas, the number dropped to less than 3,000 on Monday . “This has slightly eased out the situation. If this continues, the oxygen crunch will resolve. We currently need 43 metric tonnes every day. We have reached a neck-to-neck level in terms of demand and supply,” said Sanjeev Wavare, assistant medical officer of health, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation deputy commissioner Smita Zagade said, “Big medical facilities such as Annasaheb Magar stadium jumbo unit and the Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital have currently been supplied with enough oxygen. The green corridor from the Chakan-based oxygen plant of a private company to these hospitals and police presence at the plant and in the war room have streamlined the work.” She added, “Distress calls from the private hospitals that we used to get earlier last week have reduced almost by 90%. Apart from our facilities, we have kept 100 oxygen cylinders on reserve for such hospitals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ventilators-a-worry-for-big-hospitals-smaller-facilities-struggle-for-oxygen/articleshow/82264196.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Visakhapatnam-based RINL supplied 8,842 tonnes of LMO in FY2020-21, over 1,300 tonnes between April 13 and April 24, 2021, as per a government statement. SAIL, on the other hand, has raised average delivery of LMO to over 800 tonnes per day from its integrated steel plants at Bhilai, Bokaro, Rourkela, Durgapur and Burnpur, delivered over 39,647 tonnes since August 2020. The production at steel plants is being ramped up by reducing the production of nitrogen and argon. Steel plants require gaseous oxygen, primarily for steel making and for oxygen enrichment in blast furnaces, apart from some general purposes like lancing and gas cutting,as per the government statement.

---||Hyderabad||Relief for many as oxygen tankers arrive from Odisha||HYDERABAD: In a sigh of relief for many, Telangana on Monday received 200 tonnes of oxygen, transported from Odisha in tankers. The oxygen will be supplied to government hospitals in Hyderabad and district hospitals across the state. The current supply is estimated to meet needs of Covid-19 patients for the next one week. As a result of a spike in demand for medical oxygen, the state government had sent tankers by flight to Odisha. These tankers reached steel plants in Odisha’s Rourkela and Anugul on Friday. RTC drivers drove the loaded tankers and reached Hyderabad by Monday evening. One tanker each has been allotted to Erragadda Chest Hospital, TIMS, King Koti while one tanker has been allocated to private hospitals. The main government hospitals in Khammam and Karimnagar have also been allocated a tanker each. Oxygen from the tankers will be filled in plants while the remaining will be supplied through cylinders wherever required. The government plans to send tankers next week to Chennai, Ballari, and Odisha. At a recent high-level meeting, it was decided that the state should compulsorily maintain reserves for at least 48 hours if an emergency arises. The state currently has 10 filling plants and five-self oxygen generating hospitals which do not need external oxygen fillings. It has been observed by officials that shortage in private hospitals is arising as a result of panic among patients whose family members insist on oxygen supply. Health minister Eatala Rajender has asked hospitals to use oxygen supplies cautiously. “There is no need to panic as we will maintain enough reserves,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/relief-for-many-as-oxygen-tankers-arrive-from-odisha/articleshow/82264378.cms||---

Despite the pleas of Swamy, no one came forward to help him shift the body as they were worried she had contracted Covid-19. Auto drivers shunned the couple even as the body of Swamy’s wife Nagalaxmi lay on the road on Sunday evening. The woman was not feeling well and died on the premises of the railway station. With the fear of Covid-19 playing on everyone’s mind, Swamy could not convince anyone to help him transport his wife’s body to the burial ground. The couple are beggars. With his pleas falling on the deaf ears passers-by, Swamy carried his wife’s body on his shoulders and started his walk towards the burial ground in Indiranagar. While walking on the road, Swamy continued to beg people to help him transport the body. Some gave him money. Local railway police, who were moved by Swamy’s plight, pooled some money and handed over Rs 2,500 to Swamy to meet the expenditure for the last rites. After reaching the burial ground, some persons helped him in digging a grave to bury the woman. Swamy himself is said to be not in good health. At many places, he had to stop to take rest with the weight of his wife’s body on his shoulders before proceeding to the burial ground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/stigma-man-walks-3km-carrying-wifes-body/articleshow/82264453.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Natco & Optimus seek emergency phase-III trial nod for oral anti-viral||HYDERABAD: Natco Pharma and Optimus Pharma on Monday said they have sought emergency approval from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) for conducting phase III clinical trials of oral, anti-viral drug Molnupiravir. The two companies said they are geared up for production of the drug and if given emergency approval for compassionate use on patients given the surge in cases, they can start churning out doses at short notice. “Pre-clinical data has shown that Molnupiravir has broad anti-influenza activity, including highly potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Patients treated with Molnupiravir achieved response within five days of therapy, indicating that the duration of treatment is short, with the additional advantage of being an oral therapy,” Natco Pharma said. Optimus Pharma chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) Dr D Srinivas Reddy said Molnupiravir is being developed for non-hospitalised mild to moderate infections of SARS-CoV-2 and the company is pushing for achieving scalability for 800mg dose of the drug. “It has been shown to be effective against a variety of viruses that use an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), as is the case with SARS-CoV-2 that is directly responsible for the transcription of Viral m-RNA of the virus in the infected subject. Early in-vitro tests of Molnupiravir on SARS-CoV-2 revealed a steady decrease in virus output that was proportional to the dose of Molnupiravir used,” the Optimus Pharma CEO said. Dr Srinivas Reddy added that this was possible as the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which the drug was designed to treat, have 99.1% nucleotide similarity. “Repeated drug exposure quickly neutralised virus populations, ensuring that none of the random mutations mediate drug resistance. As the drug is introduced in higher amounts, the titer levels and genome output of SARS-CoV-2 decrease exponentially,” Reddy said. On the reason for pushing for clinical studies though Merck has pulled the plug on trials on hospitalised patients, Dr Srinivas Reddy said Molnupiravir was only marginally successful in preventing severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/natco-optimus-seek-emergency-phase-iii-trial-nod-for-oral-anti-viral/articleshow/82264481.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Experts reiterated there are only a limited number of ICU beds with oxygen in hospitals, and those with severe symptoms should be able to get those facilities. “Patients who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms do not require hospitalisation. They must isolate themselves in a separate room with a bathroom at home if they test positive. They must be in touch with doctors through video consultancy and do as they say,” said Dr B Bhaskar Rao, MD, KIMS Hospital and president of Telangana Super Speciality Hospitals Associations. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/stay-home-if-you-have-mild-symptoms/articleshow/82264459.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

No one was arrested in the two cases. A 12-year-old girl was gang-raped by two youths at a village under Mirganj police station area in Purnia when the victim had gone to graze her goats in an agriculture field. The victim's mother told the police that they started searching her when she didn’t return home in the evening. Later, she was found in an unconscious state in a field. The family narrated the ordeal to the local mukhiya, who helped them lodge a complaint. Mirganj SHO Vijay Kumar Yadav said Nitish Kumar and Manish Kumar have been named as accused in the FIR. “Both the accused are reported to be absconding after the incident,” he told this newspaper over the phone. In another incident, a 16-year-old girl was gang-raped at a village under Dariyapur police station area in Saran district when the victim had gone to attend the call of nature in a field Sunday evening. According to the police complaint, two youths, identified as Gautam Rai and Vidhan Rai, forcibly took her to a field and raped her. They threatened her with dire consequences before escaping from the spot. The girl was sent to Chhapra Sadar hospital for medical examination. Her statement would be recorded later in the court under Section 164 of CrPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/two-girls-gang-raped-in-purnia-and-saran/articleshow/82263428.cms||---

Trends indicate that while these districts initially did not have as many cases as the GHMC area but have shown a jump in case load during the second wave due to their proximity to the city. Around 10 to 20 per cent of the state’s daily case load is being reported from these districts. In Medchal, Qutubaullapur,Bala Nagar, ECIL and Boduppal are reporting the most cases while Hayatnagar, BN Reddy Nagar make up most case numbers in Rangareddy district. While the government has declared micro-containment zones in these districts, it has been said that containment activity is minimal at present with no other restrictions in place apart from a night curfew. Several residents in these districts are frequent commuters into the city due to business and other activities and movement between these areas has also been attributed to the rise in Covid-19 cases. Many of these areas also house gated communities which have become clusters for the virus. Currently, Hyderabad has 47 containment zones followed by Vikarabad with 21, Rangareddy with 15, and Medchal with five. Interestingly, Vikarabad has fewer cases of Covid-19 as compared to the other two surrounding districts but has more micro-containment zones, indicating a concentration of infection in few areas. With no data on micro-containment zones at present, primary health centre-wise Covid-19 protocols cannot be implemented according to a district health official. “There are many farm houses, villas, and function halls in these districts where large gatherings or even private gatherings can lead to a spurt in cases. People cannot take that risk,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/districts-around-hyd-adding-cases-rapidly/articleshow/82264324.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Some faculty members, attending college to complete NAAC and NBA accreditation work, are said to have been infected as Covid-19 protocols are not followed in buses and on campus. It has been reported the five faculty members have succumbed to the virus in the last week. “15 members have tested positive for Covid-19 from our college but the management has asked us to continue reporting to college,” a faculty member from a college in Medchal-Malkajgiri said on condition of anonymity. The faculty member said the management had offered the work from home recently but with a rider that those working remotely will only be paid 50% of their salary. As per sources, 20 positive cases have been reported from a college in Chilkur, 15 from a college in Saroornagar, and another five faculty members from a college in Karimnagar. “As many as 15 faculty tested positive for Covid-19 from our college and most are from computer science and IT department. In fact, in seven to eight cases, even family members of faculty have tested positive,” said B Janaiah, faculty member at a college in Saroornagar mandal. Faculty members at technical colleges estimated that at least 90% of colleges have around 10 active cases among staff. Faculty members said management was not providing any support when someone tested positive or died. Some are even said to be taking action when faculty misses college after testing positive. “In most cases, no help is extended by managements. Not even for last rites of faculty,” said A Santosh Kumar, president, Telangana Schools Technical Colleges Employees Association. College management said that even they are helpless in the situation. “We want to stand by our faculty but there is nothing much we can do. Unless the government pays us reimbursement dues, we won’t even be able to get insurance for our staff,” said KVK Rao, general secretary, All India Federation of Self Financing Technical Institutions adding that almost all technical colleges in the state currently have about 10 to 15 active Covid-19 cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/engg-colleges-carry-on-despite-faculty-testing-ve/articleshow/82277579.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Begusarai DM Arvind Kumar Verma on Monday said there is no shortage of medical oxygen for treatment of serious Covid patients in the district. “In fact, we can supply oxygen to four or five neighbouring districts after starting a closed oxygen plant here. We can also ensure enough supply of liquid oxygen tankers,” he said. Verma said the district administration is ramping up the Covid treatment facilities by installing 10 dedicated beds in each of the PHCs with five beds with oxygen facility. “Even now, the institutional Covid hospitals have enough vacant oxygen-equipped beds. However, very few oxygen-equipped beds are available in various private hospitals,” he said. Meanwhile, during the daily Covid monitoring on Saturday, the DM asked the BDOs and block level health officials to start random Covid testing under their jurisdictions to contain the spread of the disease. Besides, testing of people coming from other states or cities is also to be ensured with the help of Asha workers and local panchayat representatives. The worst-hit of the second wave of pandemic in the district has been the Begusarai town area where the cases have maintained a consistently rising trend. To counter the situation, the district administration has already ordered that markets would open in a staggered manner with only shops and services dealing in essential commodities and services allowed to open daily. Experts, however, express concern as the pandemic this time has been able to make inroads into the rural areas as Covid cases are being reported from even remote areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ten-covid-beds-at-each-phc-in-begusarai-dm/articleshow/82263304.cms||Rajiv Kumar

According to the recent National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) report, Hyderabad city alone has 48.7 per cent women and 33.1 per cent men under the overweight category, way higher than the numbers in Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi, Ahmedabad, or Chennai. Across Telangana, 28 per cent of women and 24 per cent of men are overweight or obese. “In ICU wards at least 40 per cent of patients fall in the category of obese or have other co-morbidities along with obesity” said a top resident doctor at Gandhi Hospital. At Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, one of the designated hospitals for Covid-19, handling mild to moderate cases, numbers are slightly lower. Read our coronavirus live blog for all the latest news and updates“If you see the Covid-19 death data, at least 50 per cent of deaths in females are among those who are obese,” said Dr Kiran Madala, in-charge head of the department of critical care at the Nizamabad Medical College. While a Covid-19 patient having diabetes, hypertension or any other co-morbidity has a high risk of severe disease, obesity alone is the single highest risk factor. In obese people, the vital capacity of the lungs — capacity to expand and contract — is lower. The abdominal fat also makes contraction difficult. “During this current wave, we are seeing 20 per cent of patients at our ICU with obesity. Among these patients, more incidents of metabolic or cardiovascular problems like stroke can be seen,” said TIMS superintendent Dr Ehsan Ahmed Khan. Moreover, since obesity is invariably linked to other co-morbidities and raises inflammatory markers in the body, the virus makes use of these markers to cause more damage, said Dr Rahul Agarwal, consultant internal medicine. “Many medicines do not work properly in obese patients as some doses are given as per body proportion. Again, when a patient is having low saturation, we usually put them on prone position (on the stomach) but for an obese patient it is a mechanical disadvantage and interferes with the process to increase oxygen flow in the blood,” added Dr Agarwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/obesity-making-recovery-difficult-for-many/articleshow/82264312.cms||Amrita Didyala

---||Mumbai||Clamour for alternate assessment for HSC exams grows; Maharashtra may take a call after national boards||MUMBAI: Even as the state government is working on drafting an alternative assessment pattern in place of the cancelled SSC (Class X) examination, there is growing demand from parents and students for a similar decision for HSC (Class XII). More than 17 lakh and 13 lakh students appear for the SSC and HSC exams in the state each year. The father of an HSC student said, “There is a lot of uncertainty concerning Class XII exams. Students do not know if and when the exams will be conducted, and they are getting frustrated as a result of it. The government needs to decide to relieve them of this anxiety.” The state, though, is unlikely to decide concerning HSC exams unless national boards such as CBSE or CISCE announce something. As of now, the national boards have announced they would review the Covid-19 situation in the first week of June and then take a decision. The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education had announced May-end as the probable dates for holding the HSC exams. The high-stake exams have the academic faculty divided too. Vidyadhar Joshi, vice-principal, V G Vaze College, Mulund, said, “Students might not be in the right frame of mind to appear for the exams as many have suffered losses in the pandemic. They might not be able to perform to their best as well. The government must consider holding college-level or course-specific entrance exams for admissions. The board could also modify the current exam format and instead hold a single-day exam to test Class XII students.” The impact on admissions has teachers worried. Sudam Kumbhar, former principal of Shailendra High School in Dahisar, said, “While not immediately, HSC exams must be conducted because it decides the students’ future. All professional courses are based on Class XII scores. The government will have to relook at all admission criteria. What would happen to students who want to join international universities?” Experts also said there is a need for central government intervention in the Class XII exams. “It’s a very high-stake exam connected to higher education nationally and globally. Conducting or assessing the performance of Class XII needs validation from the ministry of education (GoI). Students have taken a lot of effort despite challenges and we should decide at a time when it’s safe to do so. Hence, let’s ensure a fair balance of academic credibility and safety,” said Francis Joseph of School Leaders’ Network who also consults with the state government concerning board exams. On Monday, the school education minister, Varsha Gaikwad held another consultation with college principals to seek recommendations about the SSC assessment pattern.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/clamour-for-alternate-assessment-for-hsc-exams-grows-maharashtra-may-take-a-call-after-national-boards/articleshow/82273077.cms||Vinamrata Borwankar
---||India||Convert nitrogen tankers to carry oxygen, steel companies told||NEW DELHI: The home ministry on Monday modified its order on liquid oxygen use by industries and allowed pharma companies, manufacturers of ampules and vials and defence forces to continue using it. The move came as firms as well as the government intensified their focus on transportation of gas, a key challenge amid claims from the home ministry that there was no shortage of oxygen. To overcome logistical challenges and facilitate the faster movement of liquid medical oxygen (LMO), the government has ordered steel companies to convert a certain number of nitrogen tankers to carry oxygen. Currently, there are 765 nitrogen tankers with a capacity of 8,345 metric tonnes and 434 argon tankers that have a capacity to transport 7,642 MT. The conversion of some of the tankers will enable more vehicles to be deployed as there are currently 1,172 tankers available for LMO, with the capacity of 15,900MT. With more vehicles at their disposal, it will be faster to move the gas needed in large quantities by Covid-19 patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/convert-nitrogen-tankers-to-carry-oxygen-steel-companies-told/articleshow/82267010.cms||---

Havne told him to come at Indrayaninagar in Bhosari,” Gavare said.The officer said the police caught Havne red-handed with the remdesivir injections. “He had demanded Rs 48,000 for the three injections. We are investigating who others are involved in the racket,”Gavare said.Inspector of the Food and Drugs Administrator (FDA) Bhagyashree Yadav has lodged a first information report against Havne.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/receptionist-held-on-charge-of-selling-key-drug-covertly/articleshow/82264215.cms||---

The region received only 1,646 vials on Sunday. The supply continued to remain low (4,455 vials) even on Monday. “The supply has slowed down since Sunday as we could get only 6,101 vials of the remdesivir in the last two days,” said Shyam Pratpwar, assistant commissioner (drug), Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The active caseload of Covid-19 has gone over 1 lakh in the Pune district. Currently, 20,000 to 25,000 Covid patients are admitted at various hospitals in the district, including those in institutional quarantine, fuelling the demand for the drug. “Central and state governments have failed to sensitise people that remdesivir is not a panacea. Had they asked independent national or state subject experts with credibility to give out talks on various platforms about this, it would have educated people and this, in turn, would have helped address this unwarranted demand,” said senior health activist Anant Phadke. He underlined that oxygen therapy, steroids and blood thinners primarily helped in recovery of admitted Covid patients. “Besides, the government should have made use of the compulsory licensing norms, which allows it to speed up the production of the drug at pharma units where production is possible,” Phadke said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/remdesivir-supply-runs-into-trouble-again-in-pmr/articleshow/82264211.cms||Umesh Isalkar

However, the exact value of the jewellery looted from Shiv Jewellers is yet to be verified. According to police, the armed robbers entered the showroom around 6pm and held the owner Mohan Dodiya at gun-point. Dodiya’s shop is the only jewellery showroom in the residential area. Senior cops including city police commissioner Manoj Agarwal rushed immediately to the crime scene. Preliminary investigation suggested that the robbers had planned the loot as they had come with weapons. They also seem to have knowledge of how much jewellery was on display in the showroom, said police sources. Police are gathering CCTV footage of the showroom and from nearby locations to ascertain the identities of the robbers. Hunt is on to nab the accused, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/three-armed-men-loot-rs-1-cr-jewellery/articleshow/82265103.cms||---
---||Chennai||‘Irresponsible’ EC should face murder charges: Madras HC||CHENNAI: Lambasting the Election Commission for failure to maintain Covid protocol during poll campaigns, the Madras high court on Monday said the EC “should be put up on murder charges…for being the most irresponsible institution.” “Now we assure you we will stop counting if we do not find before May 2 a blueprint on how proper maintenance of Covid protocol will be maintained so that this state does not succumb to your idiosyncrasies any further,” the judges said in the course of their oral observations. The first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy even threatened to stop the counting of assembly poll votes slated for May 2. They made the observations while hearing a public interest writ petition filed by TN minister M R Vijayabhaskar, who sought directions to the ECI to ensure fair counting of votes. “You (ECI) are the only institution responsible for the situation that we are in today. You have been singularly lacking any kind of exercise of authority…You have not taken measures against political parties holding rallies despite every order of this court saying ‘maintain Covid protocol, maintain Covid protocol’ like a broken record,” the bench said. “The significance of adhering to such protocol may have been lost on the EC going by the puerile silence on the part of the commission as campaigns and rallies were conducted without distancing norms being maintained and in wanton disregard of the other items of the protocol,” it added. A bit of the observations found mention in the order as well, when the bench said: “At no cost should the counting result in being a catalyst for a further surge – politics or no politics, and whether the counting takes place in a staggered manner or is deferred.” “Public health is of paramount importance and it is distressing that constitutional authorities have to be reminded in such regard. It is only when citizens survive that they enjoy the other rights that this democratic republic guarantees unto them. The situation is now one of survival and protection and, everything else comes thereafter,” the court said. The judges made the observations while hearing a public interest writ petition filed by Tamil Nadu transport minister M R Vijayabhaskar, who is AIADMK’s candidate in Karur constituency where 77 candidates are in the fray. He had sought directions to the ECI to follow measures aimed at ensuring fairness in the counting of votes on May 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/irresponsible-ec-should-face-murder-charges-madras-hc/articleshow/82265108.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Amid Ramzan fasting, Muslims brave heat to queue up at booths||Dilshad Hossain did not sleep after eating his sehri, a pre-dawn meal Muslims eat prior to the day-long fasting, around 4.30am. He offered his prayers and read some holy verses from the Quran. Around 7.15am he left home for the polling booth in his neighbourhood with his voter ID card. Mohammad Aftab went to the polling booth with his aged mother around 1pm but returned home after seeing a long queue. He went again to cast his vote and took his mother after 4 pm when the temperature cooled down considerably. Despite the intense heat, long hours of fasting due to Ramzan and the fear of contracting the virus, Muslim men and women of all age groups turned up in large numbers at their local polling booths in different south Kolkata constituencies. In Port, Ballygunge and Bhowanipore, there are several pockets with substantial Muslim population. Long queues were seen outside polling booths in these areas since early morning. The turnout thinned a little between noon and 2.30pm but people were back in the queues as soon as the temperature cooled sown. In many areas of Port and Ballygunge, people were still in the queue after 5pm. Many of them brought water and dates in case their turn did not come before the time to break the fast. “Fasting is farz (compulsory) on me for being a Muslim. Similarly, voting is a farz on me for being an Indian and the Constitution grants me this democratic right. I was never in two minds about coming to vote on Monday,” said Dilshad Hussain later in the day. The community, be it urban areas or rural areas, has always voted in large numbers. But this time the triple whammy of heat, Ramzan and the virus threatened to impact the turnout adversely. Muslims fast for over 15 to 16 hours during the month of Ramzan and cannot consume food and water. The heat and humidity in the months of April, May and June sap rozedars of all energy. Temperature on Monday was hovering around 39.5°C. “This is a very important election and certain groups want the Muslim votes to be divided, which would then help some fascists forces. People who fast go about their regular work like business, service or household chores, which is more strenuous. Voting is a very simple task,” said Sufian Khan, a resident of Alif Nagar in Garden Reach. In many booths, the administration made arrangements for overhead sheds so that people did not have to stand in the queue in the sun. In many places people complained that the queue was stagnant because the polling officials were not quick enough at work. “Both I and my mother are fasting. I am a tailor, but I took an off from my shop and came to vote with my mother. But when I saw that it was taking a long time, I dropped my mother home and returned to cast my vote,” said Aftab. In many booths polling agents were fasting. “We had to report around 6am and we cannot step out till the last vote is cast. It is a tough task but the festival of democracy comes only once in five years,” said Mushtaq Mohammad, a polling agent in Ballygunge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/amid-ramzan-fasting-muslims-brave-heat-to-queue-up-at-booths/articleshow/82264223.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Entry of visitors has been banned in many departments in view of the rising cases. According to authorities and various state government employees’ unions, close to 600 employees have tested positive for the novel coronavirus and two dozen people have died from the viral infection in the past two weeks. “We are asking visitors to send online requests or come after a month. We are trying to remain safe as far as possible,” said a senior official. The majority of employees infected were from departments that have direct contact with the people and field duties such as police, medical and health, municipal administration, revenue, marketing, panchayat raj, and registrations departments. “We have asked the state government to give special casual leave to employees who were infected at least for two weeks. A similar request was made to the government during the first wave but there was no response on our representation,” A Satyanarayana, general secretary of Telangana Gazetted Officers Association, told TOI. At the Telangana secretariat, at least 100 employees were infected with the virus and those who are healthy have been asked to attend office on every alternate day. Both secretariat and Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) have restricted entry of visitors at their offices after several employees in the secretariat and GHMC tested positive for Covid-19. At the secretariat, two employees died of the Covid-19 infection. The district collectorates and other departments have stopped weekly public grievance programmes such as ‘Praja Vani’. “Some employees especially in the secretariat are working from home as the file movement is through the e-office. But many field-level employees are compelled to work in the risky conditions,” Mamilla Rajender, president, Telangana non-Gazetted employees Association, told TOI. Official sources said though there are no official orders on working with 50% staff, the heads of the departments are taking decisions and allowing their staff to work from home in view of the grim situation.  “Employees have been asked to reduce their field visits unless it is important and urgent. On the government’s directions, vaccination was made compulsory to enter the offices,” a senior official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/work-hit-at-sectt-govt-offices-as-600-employees-test-covid-ve/articleshow/82264213.cms||Koride Mahesh

This was revealed from figures uploaded on the state website: Covidinfo.rajasthan.gov.in. The portal shows that the situation is the worst in Tonk, where the district hospital has only one ventilator. This is former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot’s constituency. Officials, however, claimed that the web portal had the wrong information and put the actual number as 15 beds with ventilators. Navindra Pathak, principal medical officer, Tonk, claimed that they have 15 beds, with six of them at the Saadat Hospital occupied at present. When TOI called up doctors and other officials, they said, pleading anonymity, that they have only one ventilator, which is also not working as they don't have a staff designated for it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-hosps-in-states-6-dists-have-less-than-10-beds-with-ventilators/articleshow/82265110.cms||Shoeb Khan

With Monday being the penultimate day for campaigning, there was no stopping the leaders from taking up a whirlwind tour of the wards in the municipal limits of Greater Warangal, Khammam and other municipal bodies as they stepped up the campaigning to reach the voters. Prominent among those who held roadshows included Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy of BJP, panchayat raj minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao of TRS, Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy of Congress, transport minister P Ajay Kumar, welfare ministers Satyavathi Rathod and Koppula Eshwar of TRS. Though the state election commission had laid down strict Covid-19 guidelines such as social distancing, the guidelines were flouted during roadshows.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/party-leaders-campaign-goes-full-throttle-despite-covid-surge/articleshow/82264217.cms||Shiva Kumar Pinna
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 38-bed ICU built at Mulund octroi naka, awaiting oxygen||Mumbai: With a a surge in Covid cases in Mulund-Bhandup belt and an acute shortage of ICU beds, BMC has set up a 38-bed Covid ICU at the defunct octroi naka in Mulund in over a week. The unit has ICU beds, ventilators, BiPAP machines, para-monitors and oxygen cylinders, doctors and nurses. The items were sourced at the ward level and the centre is only awaiting supplies of liquid oxygen to start admitting patients. BMC has tied up with agencies to appoint doctors and nurses to run the centre. “We had started work on the ICU unit since there was a shortage of ICU beds. We have got 12 ventilators and 26 Bi-PAP machines. We have four Dura cylinders and we will get four more. The unit is air-conditioned and there is a generator backup too,” said Kishori Gandhi, assistant municipal commissioner, T ward. BJP MLA from Mulund Mihir Kotecha said the centre will give relief to patients. “We have over 3,000 active cases in Mulund, and there is a desperate need for ICU beds since most patients are from buildings and are senior citizens.. It’s a welcome move that BMC has started a 38-bed dedicated ICU unit at octroi naka so quickly. We have helped BMC in sourcing equipment and getting doctors and healthcare support staff. They will work round-the-clock in shifts. There will also be 60 regular beds of those discharged from ICU before they can go home,” said Kotecha. Kotecha said BMC must immediately provide oxygen to the centre. “This will be the most important ICU centre in eastern suburbs. BMC has done a great job by setting up the ICU centre at the ward level. It must now provide oxygen supply and let patients be admitted. If there is a need, this centre can be expanded. BMC must focus on building small ICU units, which is the need of the hour, and not only jumbo centres, which will take months to get ready,” Kotecha said. A senior civic official said the ward will have to sign an agreement with an oxygen supplier. Gandhi said they are expecting oxygen supply to start on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-38-bed-icu-built-at-mulund-octroi-naka-awaiting-oxygen/articleshow/82265114.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) commissioner Rajesh Patil on Sunday issued necessary guidelines on the arrangement, according to which only asymptomatic patients or those with extremely mild symptoms could be accommodated in such isolation centres. Covid-19 patients with comorbidities, pregnant women and children aged below 10 years would not be admitted to these isolation centres. The guidelines also mentioned that the civic body would appoint a dedicated medical squad to monitor the patients at such centres twice a day.Patil said, “Representatives of our call centre will contact the patients at such centres on a daily basis. They can be shifted to hospitals if their health deteriorates. The biomedical waste will be collected by the PCMC staffers. More societies should come forward for the initiative. Even the empty flats could be used as isolation centres.”PCMC’s Covid-19 spokesperson, Shirish Poredi,sad that there must be around 10,000 societies across the civic limits. “If 10% of these housing societies come forward with this arrangement, it will ease the burden on the civic facilities. The housing society members will just have to inform the nearby civic hospital to ensure the patients’ monitoring,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-allows-isolation-units-in-housing-society-clubhouses/articleshow/82264222.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The state is hoping to cross the milestone of overall 1.5 crore vaccinations by Tuesday, principal health secretary Dr Pradip Vyas said. Currently, Mumbai, Thane and Pune are the leading districts. Immunisation centres in Mumbai opened to chaotic scenes on Monday as thousands lined outside facilities 6am onwards. Senior citizens were forced to wait in the sun for 4-5 hours as serpentine queues stretched out. Social media was abuzz with complaints of CoWin not yielding appointments, or cancelled ones, forcing many to walk in to centres and wait with those who were unregistered. BMC numbers said 45,326 took the vaccine in the city on Monday, nearly double Sunday’s tally of 23,419. Borivli resident Shaili Sharma, 64, and her 69-year-old husband stood from 8.30am till noon outside the Dahisar jumbo vaccination centre. “At least three people fainted because of the heat and sat down on the road,” she said, adding waiting without toilet arrangements was difficult for the elderly. Sharma had failed to get an appointment on CoWin for the past 25 days. An acute shortage of doses was experienced at nearly all private centres over the past week, prompting many to stop inoculation. On Monday, civic officials said news of fresh stocks arriving brought many who were waiting for the second dose. So far, over 7.5lakh senior citizens have taken the first dose in Mumbai while 1.44lakh have taken both doses. Similarly, less than 50,000 from the age group of 45-59 have taken the second dose, while over 7.48lakh have taken the first one. Anand Kadkol, who stood for hours at the Nesco vaccination centre in Goregaon, questioned on Twitter whether the system was ready to open vaccination for all considering how the elderly were struggling to get their first and second doses. A 70-year-old woman, who went to a private hospital in Vile Parle, did not get the vaccine despite waiting six hours. Dr Neelam Andrade, dean of Nesco, said they have tied up with NGOs for crowd management. “The rush was extraordinary on Monday and the footfall must have exceeded 3,000-4,000,” she said, adding they had used up most of the 7,500 doses they received on Monday. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer said the city had doses to sustain the drive for two more days. At private centres like Holy Spirit in Andheri, CEO Sneha Joseph said they could vaccinate 516 people and had to turn away the rest. “We had requested for 300 vials (3,000 doses) but got only 90. We may be able to vaccinate only a few hundred on Tuesday,” she said. Dr Lalit Sankhe, nodal officer of JJ Hospital’s vaccination centre, said they have exhausted Covaxin doses. “If we get stocks, priority will mostly be given to those due for second doses. We have enough Covishield,” he said. Dr Vyas said the state completed vaccinating a total of 1.48crore citizens with at least one dose by Monday evening. Congratulating immunisation teams, CM Uddhav Thackeray and health minister Rajesh Tope said the target was to double daily vaccination hereon. When asked about availability of doses, Vyas said, “Government of India (GOI) says consume supplies and (then) ask. We believe that GOI will support us,” he added. Prior to the 5 lakh daily vaccination record, the state had set a national record on April 3 by vaccinating 4.62 lakh in a day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-gives-record-5l-jabs-in-a-day-amid-hours-long-queues/articleshow/82269867.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The portal opening ceremony of the Chamoli-based shrine was also attended by tourism minister Satpal Maharaj. According to age-old tradition, the doors of the temple are opened by a blindfolded priest. No one, besides the priest opening the temple, is allowed inside the sanctorum. “It is said that Nagaraja (the serpent king in Hindu mythology) lives in this shrine with a precious gem (mani) but no one can withstand the sight of beholding the deity's form which is why even the priest has his eyes covered,” said Krishna Singh Bisht, president of Latu Devta and Maa Nanda Devi temple committee. Every year, a fair is organised in the temple premises but only a symbolic event was held this year in the wake of spiralling Covid-19 cases. “The temple will remain open for six months but no one will be allowed to enter the temple’s main sanctum. After six months, the priest will shut the portals of the temple blindfolded,” added Bisht.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhands-unique-temple-which-opens-for-a-day-in-a-year-where-the-priest-approaches-the-deity-with-eyes-blindfolded-opens-amid-covid-restrictions/articleshow/82263587.cms||Ishita Mishra

A video of the celebration went viral on social media and many wondered how so many people gathered, but ordinary people are scrutinised by police when going out for some essential work.Voltage Club manager Avinash Devendra and Jagdish Chunal, a Khar resident, and a girl were among those booked. Chunal was arrested by Economic Offences Wing (EOW) in 2013 for fraudulently buying a flat and cheating the flat-owner. Santacruz police handed over the 14 to Khar police, who booked them under Indian Penal Code sections for disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant, violation of Covid norms and section 144 of Mumbai Police Act. All were later granted bail at the police station itself, said Gajanand Kabdule, senior inspector of Khar police.Chunal told TOI, “It was not a party. Friday was my birthday, so on Saturday, when I visited the hotel, few staff members cut a small cake. Things have been blown out of proportion.’’ Mumbai Police took cognizance of the party after social activist Mohsin Shaikh uploaded the video on twitter and tagged them. “When my source sent me the video I decided to bring the culprits to book. I immediately tagged Mumbai Police. No one was wearing a mask, there was no social distancing. Is lockdown meant only for ordinary people?” said Shaikh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-14-held-for-violating-covid-norms-with-party-at-hotel/articleshow/82265139.cms||Ahmed Ali

It has requested the Centre to consider increasing remdesivir quota for Gujarat on priority basis, principal health secretary Jayanti Ravi has claimed in her affidavit.The government has said that against its orders for procurement of 10.39 lakh remdesivir vials since April 1, it has received 5.17 lakh injections till date.On HC’s direction to frame a state policy, the government said that it has modified distribution policy in the changed scenario and now the distribution channel is managed by the Gujarat Medical Supplies Corporation Ltd (GMSCL). It distributes injections on pro-rata basis to each district and corporation after receiving their requirements. The district authorities will send injections to all hospitals after they send details of patients requiring remdesivir. GMSCL considers requests of private hospitals also. The government explained the mechanism to send remdesivir to private hospitals. Between April 21 and 23 in Ahmedabad, GMSCL gave 16,220 vials to hospitals including 2,160 injections to AMC hospitals, 1,305 to designated hospitals and 1,010 injections to private hospitals. It said that the government has come up with a detailed treatment guideline for all types of Covid patients depending upon their severity. It asserted there are “no studies to state that remdesivir clears viral load”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/remdesivir-quota-cut-after-centres-policy/articleshow/82264244.cms||---

Despite the six officials working in Hyderabad affected by the pandemic, the remaining staff members are attending to their duties to keep a check on the corrupt activities among the government officials. In the last two weeks, six officials of the ACB working in Hyderabad, including a senior official and four inspectors, tested positive for Covid-19 and they are currently in home quarantine. While the senior officer seems to have contracted the virus while frequently appearing for court work as part of his duty, the rest of the staff contracted the virus as part of their regular field duties. “Luckily, a majority of the affected personnel have taken both the doses of the vaccine. Their symptoms are not severe and all of them are home quarantined,” said an ACB official. Due to the pandemic, some of the office staff at ACB state headquarters are working on rotation to curtail the spread of the virus. Meanwhile, other members of the city ranges are handling the work of their colleagues who are under quarantine. “The number of complaints have gone down in the city during the past one month due to the Covid-19 wave. But, we are verifying all the complaints that are coming our way and other investigations are also going on while ensuring Covid-19 protocols at the workplace,” said an ACB official from Hyderabad. Recently, six officials of ACB working in Karimnagar, including a DSP, inspector and four constables, had also tested positive for Covid-19 and according to senior officials, they are under home quarantine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-hits-acb-6-key-field-level-officials-contract-virus/articleshow/82264230.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Slums beat posh areas in race to shore up polling numbers||Time: 9.30am. Location: South Calcutta Girls College on Sarat Bose Road. Badal Mandal, a resident of Pearabagan slum was impatiently waiting for his parents and wife to enter the polling booth. The wait was over in another 10 minutes and together they stood in the queue to vote. As the day progressed the queue grew longer after a large number of voters from the slum started gathering near the polling station. Time: 11am. Location: Charu Chandra College, Lake Road. A Trinamool agent is wooing residents to the deserted booths. Lake Road and the adjoining streets wore a deserted look and there were hardly voters at this polling station that had four booths. This contrasting picture largely summed up the character of the seventh phase polling in south Kolkata, at least in large areas that fall under Rashbehari and Ballygunge constituencies. While the Covid cast its shadow on the electorate in south Kolkata’s posh neighbourhoods, it could not dampen the spirit of the slum dwellers. After a tour of these two constituencies a TOI team found this contrast everywhere — slum residents eagerly queuing up for voting and residents of posh neighbourhoods refraining from exercising franchise. The contrast that was shown at polling booths located closer to Pearabagan slum and Lake Road was replicated in other posh neighbourhoods and slums across Rashbehri and Ballygunge. Bimal Mullick, a resident of a Tollygunge slum and a contractual worker with KMC solid waste management department managed a half day leave and didn’t miss the opportunity to stand in a queue at Sahanagar High School braving extreme heat and humidity. But the picture was different in large areas of New Alipore and Mudiali (not very close from the slum) where a section of residents especially from high-rises and complexes decided to stay indoors. Similarly, the tony neighbourhoods of Ballygunge, Lake Market and Southern Avenue had a lukewarm response to the “democratic festival”. So, when a Trinamool agent in Lake Road was lamenting that by noon four booths of Charu Chandra College had recorded only 25% voting, his counterpart at Pearabagan slum had reasons to rejoice as Calcutta Girls College polling station by then had recorded 45% voting. Debasish Kumar, Trinamool candidate from Rashbehari, conceded he had witnessed a rare low turnout of voters from high-rises and posh neighbourhoods. But BJP candidate Lt Gen (retd) Subrata Saha felt the mandate this time was going to be clear and it could not be altered by low turnout of voters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/slums-beat-posh-areas-in-race-to-shore-up-polling-numbers/articleshow/82264250.cms||Saikat Ray

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Two held for selling remdesivir illegally||AHMEDABAD: Two persons who used the letter pad of a hospital to illegally procure 30 injections of remdesivir from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel hospital were arrested by Ellisbridge police on Monday. The injections were procured by the accused, one of whom is an employee of Shifa hospital, on the pretext of giving it to patients in home isolation. The police was acting on an application that the injections were procured on bogus documents. Ellisbridge Inspector S N Chaudhary and PSI V I Rabari began investigation. A complaint has been registered against one Altaf Asraf Lohiya, Yasminbanu Parbin Shaikh, Jakir Hussain Shaikh and other staff of Shifa hospital. Chaudhary said that during investigation, it was established that the three forged documents of four patients allegedly under home quarantine, and acquired 30 injections from SVP hospital. He said that so far Altaf and Jakir have been arrested, and Yasminbanu will be arrested soon. Police said that Altaf who works at Shifa hospital got in touch with former nurse Yasminbanu and the two, along with Jakir, got 30 injections between April 11 and April 14. The three drew up fake prescriptions and documents of patients to submit at SVP and procure the injections. The officials said that since the prescription was on the letter pad of the registered hospital, no further inquiry was conducted and the injections were given to Altaf, Yasminbanu and Jakir. The three then sold off the injections at a higher rate to the other patients. The officials said that following directive from a senior to check black-marketing of remdesivir injection, the investigation on the application was taken up on war footing and the entire racket was exposed. The Ellisbridge police have registered a case. They are inquiring if more employees of Shifa hospital are involved in the racket and if the accused got more injections on fake prescriptions. However, a senior AMC official said that they send injections to the hospital on receipt of an official e-mail. It is now a matter of investigation as to how the injections were handed over in person to these three.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/two-held-for-selling-remdesivir-illegally/articleshow/82264277.cms||---

The Central health ministry on Monday acknowledged the plateauing of cases in Maharashtra, saying it has crossed its daily peaks. Total cases in the state has touched 43.4 lakh and deaths have crossed the 65,000-mark to touch 65,284. Experts say while cases are dropping or consistent, the daily case fatality rate in the state has gone up to over 1% from the 0.7% a few days ago. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said cases in the state have been consistent and number of discharges are picking pace which is a positive sign. BMC officials said cases have steadily dropped in Mumbai—from 11,206 on April 4 to 9,989 on April 11 to 3,840 on April 26.BMC additional municipal commissioner Ashwini Bhide said cases and positivity rate have steadily declined though testing numbers have dipped as well; on Sunday, 28,328 tests were conducted as against 40,000 on an average. “While there is some room for cheer, we just can't let our guard down,” she added. BMC executive health officer Mangala Gomare said despite the fewer tests, positivity rate in Mumbai on Monday was among the lowest this month of 13.6%. “Deaths may rise as these correspond to cases that tested positive during the peak roughly 15 days back,” she added. Earlier in the day, BMC commissioner I S Chahal listed out the “positive” developments for the city. For one, Mumbai still has 4,090 vacant beds in 172 Covid hospitals. “We have increased the number of beds from 12,000 to 22,000 in the last six weeks, adding 1,500 more beds at the NESCO field hospital, Goregaon, this week,” he said. Number of ICUs have also increased from 1,500 to almost 2,800 now. “In the second wave which started on February 10, total number of new cumulative cases have been 3 lakh and the cumulative deaths have been 1,319. Mortality rate for the second wave has been 0.4% and this is the lowest anywhere in the world,” he said. Meanwhile, the Kalyan-Dombivli belt reported its lowest tally in 25 days at 854.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Over 1k civilians appointed as spl officers to assist city police force||Mumbai: To avoid manpower problems while managing bandobast during the Covid19 situation, the city police have appointed 1,100 civilians as special police officers to assist them in bandobast to make people follow the Covid19 guidelines and obey the rules. The prime duty of such special policemen is at containment zones where they are assisting the police in maintaining the rules. The selection criteria of such special police officers were their previous social service background and clean image. They have been deployed near sealed buildings. Their other duties include to help residents in buying essential services items. Chaitanya S, DCP (operations) who is also city police’s spokesman, said that the appointment has been done to provide extra manpower for the purpose of deployment outside sealed buildings. “There is no batch or uniform (for them). Zonal deputy police commissioner is authorised to appoint. Till now 1100 have been appointed,” said Chaitanya. He added that the special police officers are assisting police in guarding sealed buildings and have been appointed after background verification. These officers are doing this duty on voluntary basis and have been given certificates of appointment, as per the Maharashtra Police Act 1951, to perform their duties. The state police in extraordinary situations can appoint civilians as officers. If anyone violates the law, the special officers can contact the local police station and inform them. The local police can take appropriate legal action against those who flout rules. This step has been taken to meet up the demand of additional force to take care of the situation. More than 8,000 police constables are currently deployed outside different sealed buildings to see that no one comes out of the building premises. City police have also roped in home guards for these duties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-over-1k-civilians-appointed-as-spl-officers-to-assist-city-police-force/articleshow/82265160.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Oscars 2021: The Academy remembers Soumitra with ‘In Memoriam’ tribute||Kolkata: It was a touching moment for Kolkata when a still of Soumitra Chatterjee from Satyajit Ray’s ‘Apur Sansar’ found a pride of place in the 93rd Academy award’s ‘In Memoriam’ page. While mourning the loss of all those artists and technical pioneers the world lost in the last one year, this page was the Oscar’s way of saying that the film community will always cherish their memories. At the prestigious ceremony that was hosted at the Los Angeles’ Union Station on April 25, Oscar nominee Angela Bassett introduced this segment mentioning how “over 3 million souls lost around the world to Covid alone”. Chatterjee’s demise, too, was after a 40-day battle after he was infected with the virus. While the 3.01 minute-long video featured actor Irrfan Khan and costume designer Bhanu Athaiya, the official ‘In Memorium’ page mentioned Chatterjee, Sushant Singh Rajput, Rishi Kapoor, Shashikala. Chatterjee’s daughter Poulami Bose called this a “heartwarming” gesture. “My father was never too excited about awards. Growing up in pre-independence India, his value system was different. He was more work-oriented than recognition-oriented. Even when he was bestowed with international awards, he would see it as a recognition of his countrymen. Had Bapi somehow seen this ‘In Memoriam’ segment, he would have said it is recognition for India rather than just his work,” she said. Since Chatterjee’s death, the family has been plagued by a series of life events. In January, Bose had tested positive and took some time to recover. On April 4, she lost her mother to kidney-related issues. Now, her daughter, Mekhola, has been infected. “She just had fever on one day. But I got her tested immediately. Now, she is in home isolation and has no symptoms,” she added. A lot of work by the Soumitra Chatterjee Foundation has been put on hold due to the second wave of Covid-19. Currently, Bose is using this time to sort Chatterjee’s collection of English and Bengali books. “Director Suman Ghosh and actor Kheyali Dastidar have taken some. I’ve gifted some to actors from my theatre group. I don’t have enough space and want the books to find a good home. So, I’ll give them to those who will read, appreciate and treasure them because they belonged to Bapi,” she said. There are some 200-odd books that are awaiting distribution. Bose had kept aside for Suman Mukhopadhyay, Kaushik Sen and Debshankar Halder – actors whom Chatterjee was extremely fond of. Incidentally, on Mrinal Sen’s death anniversary, many of the legend’s books and trophies were also gifted away to people who wanted them. “I also have such plans. I will keep the very important ones and give away the rest to others,” she added. Meanwhile, she has also found some “sweetly-penned” letters sent to Chatterjee by his father and elder brother. “Somewhere, he was endearingly addressed as ‘Pulu sona’ or ‘Pulu buro’. I also found some letters written by maa to him. I also found All India Radio’s appointment letter to Bapi in 1958 for the post of an announcer and his personal script of ‘Raja Lear’.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/oscars-2021-the-academy-remembers-soumitra-with-in-memoriam-tribute/articleshow/82264285.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

He added that proper food is being served to the patients. “We have taken all precautions and made all arrangements while admitting the patients. They are given proper food from breakfast to dinner,” said Maravi. Bhopal railway division officials said that they have also planned to put around 20 isolation coaches at Habibganj station. “We have done all kinds of preparations to place isolation coaches at Habibganj station, too. However, it depends only on the response given to the isolation coaches placed at Bhopal railway station,” said a railway official without quoting his name. These coaches are equipped with essential medicines and necessary staff. Coolers and mosquito nets have also been installed in these isolation coaches so that Covid-19 patients can stay comfortably during the summer time. The prepared isolation coaches will have asymptomatic patients. Besides, patients who have elderly, pregnant women, children in their homes and want to have isolated places can also avail the facility. Also, positive patients who remain in home isolation but do not have a place in their homes and they need to be under doctor's supervision, such patients can get themselves treated by coming to this center. Psychiatrists will also visit this center daily and will tell people about how to cope with this disease in a better way. With this, a team of doctors will also be available 24x7 with modern resources. Last year, Bhopal railway division had converted 133 train coaches into isolation wards as potential ‘emergency hospitals’ to tackle the Covid surge of 2020. Around 20 of them were sent to Jabalpur, say officials. Some other states have also used them. But 56 of these isolation coaches were left unused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/on-day-1-10-patients-admitted-to-isolation-coaches-at-bhopal-station/articleshow/82263608.cms||---

The restrictions will stay till May 3. According to the order, locals can only venture out of their homes for purchasing essential commodities. Himanshu Kafaltia, SDM Purnagiri, told TOI, “New cases of Covid-19 are rising dramatically in Tanakpur and Banbasa towns. The decision has been taken to contain the spread of the virus. Also, nine localities have been turned into containment zones in these two towns.” The grocery shops have been allowed to open between 7 am and 12 noon. All shops selling non-essential goods are to remain shut. However, medical stores, petrol pumps and other gas stations have been allowed to function all day. A maximum of 50 people will be allowed in wedding ceremonies. Works on projects being carried out in public interest will also carry on. The markets in these towns host a significant number of buyers from Nepal who will now have to look for other options. “The Indo-Nepal border has not been shut for cross border movement,” clarified SDM Kafaltiya. The new restrictions are likely to further hit the turnout at the Purnagiri Mela, which is already witnessing low pilgrim footfall. The Mela will go on till April 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/covid-19-curfew-put-in-place-in-tanakpur-and-banbasa-towns-adjoining-the-nepal-border/articleshow/82263615.cms||Prem Punetha

The vehicle was seized under the provisions of Section 207 of the Motor Vehicle Act. During the lockdown, Gujarat Police impounded thousands of vehicles they caught on the roads. Police later started releasing them after their impound space became full of seized vehicles.Shaikh’s auto was lying with police for nearly a year before the case filed over the impounded vehicle came up for hearing before additional metropolitan magistrate V D Modh. The court asked the prosecutor when can cops invoke Section 207 of the MV Act. The prosecution submitted that violation of various sections of the MV Act such as not having proper documents or a permit to run a particular vehicle can lead to seizure of the vehicle under Section 207. The court said that Section 192(5) gives authority to the officer to impose a compoundable fee on the violator and if the offence is non-compoundable, the officer can seize the RC book and issue a receipt to the vehicle owner.However, the police could not reply to the court’s specific query: Whether a vehicle can be detained for a lockdown violation. Dariapur police station could not place any document on record to justify the action. This led the court to say, “This court believes that action cannot be taken under Section 207 of the Motor Vehicle Act for violation of lockdown.” It ordered the police to release the vehicle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cops-cant-impound-vehicle-for-lockdown-violation-court/articleshow/82264284.cms||---

His 105-year-old father, Dhenu Chavan, and 95-year-old mother, Motabai, proved everyone wrong. The couple spent nine days in the ICU of Vilasrao Deshmukh Institute of Medical Sciences in Latur battling the virus, and came out victorious. Doctors who treated the centenarian couple said early diagnosis and timely treatment helped them beat the virus. A total of five members of the Chavan family had tested positive on March 24. “We live as a joint family. Other than my parents, the three children had tested positive too. My parents were running high temperatures and my father had a severe stomachache as well, and so I decided to admit them both to a hospital,” said Suresh. He found a bed at the government medical college, which is three hours away from this village. “My parents were very scared and so was I, but I knew that keeping them at home would be a wrong decision,” said Suresh. This decision on his behalf proved helpful. “They had a CT (computed tomography) score of 15/25, which was a concern due to their age. They were on oxygen support and were also given five doses of the antiviral remdesivir injections,” said Dr Gajanan Halkanche who treated the couple. Dhenu Chavan was discharged on April 5 while Motabai took two more days to recover. ‘They were brought to us in time and there was no delay in seeking treatment and that made a significant difference,” said Dr Halkanche. Latur district is currently seeing an average of 1,000 cases daily and several patients are not getting tested in time and coming in the hospital with very severe symptoms. “We are appealing to the public to ensure they get tested as soon as they see any symptoms. Timely detection and treatment will ensure complete recovery,” said Dr Halkanche. Suresh said he would go to the hospital every day and see his parents from a small glass window. “He would always ask me if they would ever get better and would see our village again. And every day I kept telling them they will be discharged tomorrow,” said Suresh. He said his father, a farmer, has been very active all his life and worked towards water conservation in the drought-prone region. He had gifted his own land to construct a school and a well in the village. “When they were discharged, people from across the district told me that it is his good deeds that have helped him fight the virus,” said Suresh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/105-yr-old-his-95-yr-old-wife-win-covid-battle-after-9-days-in-icu/articleshow/82265895.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Mumbai||Ward-level war rooms may have helped cut chaos in Mumbai's worst phase||MUMBAI: The city’s 24 ward war rooms, the bridge between Covid-19 patients and hospitals, have come in for praise from residents of other cities where hospital admissions are stressful and chaotic. Such rooms, tweeted Dr Anoop Misra from the national capital, “are needed in Delhi, those which can see if beds/ventilators are available in real time, and direct waiting people to the nearest hospital.” The brainchild of BMC chief I S Chahal, the war rooms came into existence on June 8, 2020. While they struggled to get beds for callers during the first wave, they have improved during the “bigger” second wave, say analysts. A typical day’s work for men and women manning these rooms includes calling up people who tested positive in the last 24 hours (roughly 7,000-8,000 patients), allotting beds to symptomatic patients and sending an ambulance to ferry them to hospital. They also have to answer hundreds of calls from people about Covid, beds, drugs and vaccination. Chahal told TOI the need for a decentralised war room in each ward was among the first things he realised on taking charge on May 8. “I’d get flooded with calls for beds and realized this wouldn’t work,” he said, adding he himself trained doctors on how to handle phone lines via a zoom meeting. “I told them they shouldn’t create panic but try to calm the patient.” Chahal was told if the war rooms went “kaput,” he’d be solely responsible. “As the city was battling a pandemic, I decided to take it upon myself,” he said. Between April and May 2020, it was BMC’s central helpline (1916) that handled calls. But 38 of its 47-member workforce -- handling 10,000 calls a day -- tested positive. “It was humanly impossible to handle all calls and that’s when the commissioner ordered it be decentralized. Our ward-level disaster control rooms were immediately changed to war rooms, and staff was strengthened,” said BMC disaster management director Mahesh Narvekar. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state task force, called the BMC war rooms a “big assest” that helped decentralize bed allotment. “This ensured the most needy got to the hospital bed and ambulances reached homes. At the peak of the pandemic, it did get a bit strained but keeping it operational round the clock helped in triaging and transfers of patients,” said Dr Joshi. According to Brinelle D’souza, senior faculty at TISS and co-convenor of NGO Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, the arrangement ensured patients do not have to run helter-skelter in an emergency. “However, this needs to be coordinated more efficiently. Every bed needs to come under the war room’s ambit. There are instances where patients, despite getting beds at government’s rates through the war room, prefer to directly take a bed from a private hospital at a much higher rate as waiting period is less,” she said. Wadala corporator, Shiv Sena’s Amey Ghole, said in the second wave, war rooms were better equipped to handle requests. But MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh said. “War rooms have slowed down bed allotment process.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ward-level-war-rooms-may-have-helped-cut-chaos-in-citys-worst-phase/articleshow/82265171.cms||Richa Pinto

Through Sunday and Monday, cops inspected 3,244 wedding venues across the state. On April 21, Gujarat’s director general of police Ashish Bhatia had issued a circular stating that registration on a government website was essential to organize a wedding event. The failure to register, the circular said, would lead to action under the Disaster Management Act and for violating the orders of police. Based on the information provided on the website, cops from the police station concerned visit the venue and check the number of people present. Based on registrations, the 3,244 venues were checked and violations were observed in 6.4% of the cases. The office of the DGP has stated that of the 207 cases, 146 pertained to not wearing masks, and 61 to flouting the guest-number norm or for not keeping sanitizers or thermal guns handy. Cops have arrested 78 people from the venues. The office of the DGP said that between December 19 last year and April 25 this year, cops have checked 17,571 wedding venues and filed 723 cases for various violations. The office said that the drive to check wedding venues will continue. Meanwhile, on Sunday 2,508 complaints were filed under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code. The offences include venturing out during the night curfew hours. Moreover, 12,454 people were fined for not wearing masks or for spitting in the open.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-inappropriate-weddings-207-cases-78-arrests/articleshow/82264295.cms||---

---||Goa||FC Goa players have done great job, can’t fault them for mistake: Ferrando||Margao: Al Rayyan coach Laurent Blanc – a World Cup winner with France in 1998 -- was ‘glad’ his team could snatch a draw from the jaws of defeat against FC Goa with a last-gasp equaliser. For Juan Ferrando, it was ‘difficult’ to accept the 1-1 result against the Qatar heavyweights, playing in this competition for the tenth time. How things have changed in less than two weeks. When group E of the AFC Champions League kicked off at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on April 14, fans across the country were delighted with a performance that saw the hosts defend resolutely to hold Al Rayyan goalless. It was an impressive debut. On Tuesday, another draw against the same opponents tasted like defeat. “Of course, it’s difficult when you lose (points) in the last minute,” said Ferrando, the Goa coach. “But the truth is we are playing against very good teams. It’s a pleasure to play against Persepolis, Al Wahda and Al Rayyan. These teams play continental football (regularly) and for us it’s a pleasure. There were some mistakes and it’s important to control.” The mistake happened right at the end. Leading by Jorge Ortiz’s third-minute goal – thanks to a terrific long ball from Brandon Fernandes – Goa had done well to keep Al Rayyan at bay till the 90th minute. But with less than a minute left on the clock, Goa goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh made an uncharacteristic mistake. A pass from the byline should have been routine collection for the in-form goalkeeper, but Dheeraj somehow got distracted with James Donachie infront of him and spilled the ball, allowing substitute forward Ali Fereydoun to score the equaliser. “The goal was in transition. When you change from attack to defence, it’s normal that the team is not ready. This is the difference between Indian (clubs) and Al Rayyan. “It’s not possible to talk about the mistakes because I know my players are exhausted. It’s necessary to talk with the players. They have done a great job. We have one more opportunity now against Al Wahda,” said Ferrando. Goa were already knocked out of the competition with Al Wahda registering a stunning 1-0 win over group leaders Persepolis FC earlier on Monday night. But for the debutants, this was not about making it to the knockout stage. This was about a first win for India in Asian football’s premier club competition. “I am happy with what the players are doing. We can learn. We cannot do the same mistakes again. It’s good to play in such competitions. When we analyse, we can look at the mistakes and find a solution during training on the pitch,” said Ferrando, whose side will take on Al Wahda in the concluding group clash on Thursday. After three defeats in a row, Blanc was simply happy to take home a point. “It was a very difficult match, but the important thing is that we walked away with a point,” said Blanc. “Against Persepolis we scored first, but later conceded three goals. With Al Wahda we were up by two goals, but unfortunately we also let in three goals. Today is different. We were down by a goal and scored to take a point."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-players-have-done-great-job-cant-fault-them-for-mistake-ferrando/articleshow/82280858.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Kolkata||32 yrs after 1989 violence, Cov fears lock in Gurusaday high-rise voters||Kolkata: A little over three decades ago, residents of two high-rise complexes on Gurusaday Road had been terrorised on voting day when miscreants first hurled crude bombs near the gate and then padlocked it to prevent residents from casting their vote. There has been no repeat of the incident during the 1989 Lok Sabha polls and residents have voted in all elections since. But on Monday, the compounds of two complexes — Kusum and Ajanta apartments — wore a deserted look as most residents chose to stay put in their apartments. Many gave voting a miss, not due to fear of violence but Covid. “Usually on election day, there is a carnival atmosphere. But the mood was very sombre on Monday. People are wary of catching Covid and are shielding themselves from the threat,” said Aditya Tibrewal, a resident of Ajanta apartment. Of the 300-odd residents in 70 flats, there are around 200 voters. That most of them are wary of voting is evident from the bunch of voter slips issued by political parties that still lay in the society’s office. Though Tibrewal wasn’t born when news of the 1989 incident had rocked the city, senior resident Balesh Bagree recalled how crude bombs were hurled near the gate around 11am and gates were padlocked thereafter to prevent residents from going to vote. “They were overzealous political party cadres. The local police were alerted. When the media got wind of the incident and landed on the spot, police broke the locks. We had all then gone to vote together,” recounted Balesh Bagree. Since then Bagree and others have voted every time. But this time it is different. “Now, it is not outsiders but fellow family members who are cautioning each other to refrain from going to vote. The fear of Covid is running deep. Unlike the miscreants whom one can spot, this is an invisible enemy. Hence, the fear,” he said. In the Kusum apartment that had also been padlocked, some residents went to vote at the Modern High School booth early in the morning. But as the day wore on, residents remained cooped inside, unwilling to risk their health and life. “Those who are stepping out are exercising extreme caution. They are wearing double masks. Some are taking additional protection with faceshield. But there are also those who aren’t sure about stepping out and giving the vote a miss; mostly very senior citizens above 75 years,” said Shaymal Mitra, chairman of Kusum apartments where around 150 voters reside in 60 flats that are occupied.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/32-yrs-after-1989-violence-cov-fears-lock-in-gurusaday-high-rise-voters/articleshow/82264287.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Congress councillors later demanded to postpone the election and even raised slogans. The name of Kaur was proposed which went unopposed. Kaur will hold the post for 20 months, said Kharar sub-divisional magistrate Himanshu Jain. Ranjit Singh Gill, SAD in-charge of Kharar constituency, said, “We have been elected by the residents of Nayagaon and we promise to deliver and develop all wards uniformly.

Earlier, on Sunday, two bodies had been recovered by rescue personnel. With this, the toll of the disaster has shot up to 15, according to the District Emergency Operation Centre (DEOC). Three persons are still missing as per Army sources. "One body was recovered from the debris on Monday morning while the other two were found from the avalanche sites in the later part of the day," said Nand Kishore Joshi, district disaster management officer. An army helicopter brought the four bodies--including the one recovered on Sunday evening--to Joshimath from Sumna where the avalanche had hit on Friday evening. As reported by TOI earlier, the Army has pressed into service an avalanche rescue sniffer dog to help the rescue personnel in the search operation.

Over 1,000 tractor-trolleys were parked at Mungalia Khot and Sukhi Sewania villages for the past five days but their wheat was not purchased, farmers alleged. Similar situation is witnessed at other procurement centres around Bhopal. Radheshyam Kushwah, a farmer, said that he was returning home on Monday after a wait of four days. He said that the officials told him that the storage facility was filled to the capacity. Prabhuram Mina, another farmer who had come from a village on the city outskirts on Vidisha road, said, “I risked my life in the days of corona crisis and waited for the past four days only to be told to go back.” This was also the case at Mungalia Chaap village near Neelbad. “Four hundered tractor trolleys were parked and restless farmers waited without maintaining social distancing,” said Tikaram Yadav, a farmer said. He alleged that the officials handling the procurement centres were not cooperating with the farmers. Cooperative department officials admitted that there were “700 trolleys laden with wheat and 250 were returned on Monday as the grain storage Silo was filled to capacity.” Meanwhile, the chief minister reviewed the rabi procurement on Monday. A government official later claimed that over 53.69 lakh metric tonnes of wheat worth Rs 10,600 crore was procured from 7.32 lakh registered farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/farmers-return-home-empty-handed-from-procurement-centres/articleshow/82263632.cms||---

The song, a mix of questions and solutions related to forest fires, is being widely appreciated on social media. “Jungle pe kali ye kiski nazar thi, bolo na jungle ye kisne jalaya, koi gya tha ye jungle jalane ya jungle ye poora khud jal gya the [did anyone go to the forest to light fire, or the fire started on its own]?" asks the 1.49-minute song uploaded by DFO Kedarnath, Amit Kanwar. Kanwar mooted the idea of taking the ‘rap’ way, which he added is the “music for today’s generation”, to create awareness about forest fires among the youth. According to the forest department, the song, accompanied by an awareness programme organised in a school, was prepared by the Pandavaas band in almost a months’ time and the band charged a minimal fee of Rs 30,000 to write, shoot, edit and produce the song. “The song not just has strong questions like who instigated the fire in the forest and why everyone was quiet when the same was being done, but also has solutions like each one to contribute to save forests,” said Rajiv Bhartari, Uttarakhand's Head of Forest Force (HOFF). According to official data, the state has witnessed 1,600 wildfire incidents in the past 25 days. These blazes claimed the lives of two individuals, left three hurt and killed 13 animals. A total of 2,274.5 hectares of forest land has been affected by forest fire incidents since April 1. Since October 2020, Uttarakhand has lost 3,289.586 hectares of forest cover in 2,342 wildfire incidents. Further, at least eight human and 20 animal lives have been lost in wildfires since January 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rap-song-on-forest-fires-create-waves-on-social-media/articleshow/82263635.cms||Ishita Mishra

However, AIMIM is contesting only from Jadcherla and Siddipet municipalities and the by-poll to 28th ward in Jalpally municipality. The party is likely to win the 28th ward by-poll unanimously as no other party has fielded candidates on request of the family members of deceased ward member, whose death necessitated the by-election. Elections are being held to municipal corporations of Greater Warangal and Khammam, five municipalities of Jadcherla, Siddipet, Nakrekal, Atchampet and Kothur and nine other municipal wards in other civic bodies. Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi-led party has fielded seven candidates in Jadcherla and four in Siddipet municipalities. Though AIMIM is a friendly party of the ruling TRS, the candidates of both the parties are in electoral fray against each other in several wards. This is not the first time that TRS-MIM are locking horns in an electoral battle despite being friendly parties. Both the parties fiercely contested GHMC election against one another in the Old City, a stronghold of AIMIM. Congress, BJP, CPI, CPM, All India Forward Bloc and independents are among the other parties in fray from Jadcherla and Siddipet municipalities. AIMIM general secretary and MLA Ahmed Pasha Quadri said the party had won a couple of wards in Jadcherla in the past when Sultan Salahuddin Owaisi was party president. There is a sizable population of SCs, STs, BCs and Muslims in the two municipalities. “Our candidates have the potential to win as they have been working in the field to solve the problems of the people,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/aimim-back-in-contest-to-lock-horns-with-trs/articleshow/82264300.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Mumbai||Covid curbs could disrupt supplies, fuel inflation: RBI||Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India has said in its ‘State of the Economy’ report that the resurgence in Covid infections, if not contained in time, risks protracted restrictions and disruptions in supply chains and consequent inflationary pressures. The RBI’s warning comes at a time when prospects of regional lockdowns have increased with rising cases of the disease. The central bank has said that it was important to entrench India’s inflation at 4% so that it (RBI) can continue to play its stabilising role. “When inflation goes beyond the comfort zone, the exclusive concern of monetary policy must be to bring it back to the target,” said the report in RBI’s Bulletin. “When inflation is within the comfort zone, authorities can look to other objectives—the objective of control of inflation is not independent of the objective of growth,” the report said. It is not clear how the inflation numbers for April and May will play out, given an uncertain base. “Going forward, the calculation of year-on-year CPI (consumer price index) inflation prints for April and May 2021 is subject to uncertainty, given that April and May CPIs a year ago were not based on actual price data collections but were imputed,” the report said. However, two positive developments were the forecast of a normal monsoon and the easing of crude oil over fears of fall in demand due to a resurgence of the pandemic. Noting that on April 19 the government announced vaccinations for all adults, the report said that economic activity in India is holding up admirably against Covid’s renewed onslaught. “Much attention has been drawn to the wilting of incoming data in the face of the second wave and localised restrictions. Yet, it is important to note that it is the sentiment indicators that have moderated,” the report said. Among the indicators, the report highlights strong growth in corporate revenues and net profits in the first quarter, which was driven by a pick-up in demand and order inflows. Rising digitalisation, improved capitalisation and growing electricity consumption are other positive indicators highlighted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-curbs-could-disrupt-supplies-fuel-inflation-rbi/articleshow/82265905.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

An oxygen monitoring committee is already operational in the district. The audit teams will constantly update the status to the committee. The eight-member committee under the chairmanship of additional deputy commissioner (G) Aashika Jain is constantly supervising the medical oxygen demand and supply logistics in the district. Dayalan said, “The teams have been constituted to monitor the supply and availability at various hospitals as the shortage has panicked the public. The teams will ensure that there is no shortage.” The audit teams comprise three members each, including an RMO, CRO and an SHO. The teams would work 24x7 to ensure daily audit of all Covid hospitals in the district. They will liaison with hospitals and ensure that they maintain two-hourly oxygen saturation chart of every patient, so that requirement per patient be assessed and the monitoring committee can keep a tab on medical oxygen consumption of each hospital. Besides, teams will ensure timely shifting of recovered patients from L3 to L2 or L1 facilities so that more L3 beds are available to critical patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-sets-up-oxygen-audit-teams/articleshow/82261002.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Dehradun||Amid Covid surge, last shahi snan to take place at Kumbh today in Haridwar||HARIDWAR: Amidst concerns of spiralling Covid-19 cases, the last shahi snan of the Maha Kumbh will take place in Haridwar on Tuesday on the occasion of Chaitra Purnima. All seven sanyasi akhadas who had earlier announced their exit from the mela will participate in the shahi snan symbolically with only a few of their seers — and not the combined strength of the akhadas — taking a dip at Har-ki-Pauri. Meanwhile, seers of Bairagi, Udasin and Nirmal akhadas – who had announced that they will participate in the snan with due rituals — will be allowed to converge in limited numbers, mela officials said. According to mela police, not more than 30 to 40 vehicles will be allowed in the procession of each of the Bairagi and Udasin akhadas. Only seers and no devotees will be allowed in the shahi snan, police added. Sanjay Gunjyal, IG (Kumbh), told TOI, “We managed to convince the Bairagi and Udasin akhadas after several rounds of talks to decrease the number of vehicles and seers in their procession for the last shahi snan.” Mahant Hari Giri, general secretary of the Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad, apex body of the akhadas, added, “In view of the Covid situation, the parishad has asked akhadas to limit the number of their seers and we are hopeful of a peaceful conduct of the last shahi snan.” The shahi snan ritual will start from 10 in the morning. Niranjani and Anand akhadas will be the first of the sanyasi akhadas to take the holy dip followed by Juna, Agni, Ahavan, Mahanirvani and Atal akhadas. The three Bairagi akhadas will take the shahi snan after the sanyasi akhadas. They will be followed by the Udasin and Nirmal akhadas. Mela officials said that RT-PCR reports of pilgrims along with valid registration will be stringently checked and if any pilgrim is found without a valid RT-PCR report, case will be registered against them under the disaster management act. Notably, the last shahi snan is an important one for akhadas of the Bairagi sect. Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal on April 17 in which he had requested seers to help in the fight against the pandemic and keep the rest of the Kumbh symbolic, the prominent sanyasi akhadas like Juna, Atal, Agni, Ahavan, Niranjani and Anand had announced closure of the Kumbh for their seers. However, the Bairagi akhadas had reiterated that they will stay put and participate in the last shahi snan with proper rituals. Some of the Bairagi seers had also alleged that the sanyasi seers who had left the Kumbh will not be allowed to participate in the last shahi snan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/amid-covid-surge-last-shahi-snan-to-take-place-at-kumbh-today/articleshow/82263105.cms||MS Nawaz

The latest incident came after Friday’s violence in Bhatpara when a 16-year-old boy was shot dead by bike-borne miscreants. Police are looking for the culprits. There were a few stray incidents on the second day of polling in Kolkata. In New Alipore under the Rashbehari constituency, a BJP polling agent was detained by local police after female agents of Trinamool Congress alleged that he had misbehaved with them. In Ballygunge, the cops detained a local BJP leader on some previous charges. In Bhatpara, locals said the incident took place around 11.30 pm on Sunday while Anurag Shaw, a first-year student studying under the Indira Gandhi Open University and a resident of Momin Para near Rustam Gumti, went out to go to toilet. “When Anurag, engrossed in his study, stepped out of his house, a bomb fell in front of him and blasted off, he sustained severe splinter injuries,” said Umesh Prasad Singh, a neighbour. Anurag was rushed to the Bhatpara state general hospital where he was declared brought dead. His father Ashoke Shaw said that at least three bombs exploded in front of their house. In Kolkata, the day’s biggest incident was reported from New Alipore where a BJP agent Mohan Rao was picked up by police from the Bidya Bharati School on charges of molestation. Rao denied being involved in any molestation during an argument with TMC agents. In another incident, DC (southeast) Sudip Sarkar said they had been searching for BJP mandal president Nepal Mondal. “We took him to the police station and made him take an oath that he would not create trouble during the polls. We then let him off,” said Sarkar. BJP candidate Lokenath Chatterjee said: “Mondal was picked up to disrupt our polling plans.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/student-killed-in-bhatpara/articleshow/82264301.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty
---||Delhi||Crew member tests positive, Air India flight returns from Sydney with cargo, without passengers||NEW DELHI: Australian authorities refused clearance to an Air India flight to fly back home with passengers on Monday after one of the crew members who was on the flight to Sydney tested Covid positive on arrival. Since the flight had a significant cargo load, the airline decided to fly it to Delhi without passengers and the cabin crew member who tested positive is in isolation in Sydney, say people in the know. AI flies once a week to Australia and that is the only nonstop between the two countries. “All crew members rostered to operate a Boeing 787 Dreamliner from Delhi to Sydney on Saturday went through the pre-flight RT-PCR Covid testing. They all tested negative and were then cleared to operate this passenger flight. On arrival in Sydney, each of them had another RT-PCR test,” said sources. The on-arrival test reports came a day later when the crew was at Sydney airport to operate this aircraft back to Delhi with passengers. One of the cabin crew members tested positive. “As per Australian rules, this aircraft was denied permission to fly to Delhi with passengers. While the crew member/s testing positive are quarantined there only, Australia asks airlines in such cases to operate the aircraft back to home country as a ferry flight (without passengers) and cargo is allowed to be carried on it,” said sources. Given the amount of cargo on this flight, possibly medical items desperately needed back home right now, AI decided to operate the flight to Delhi with the same. This is the second time such a thing has happened with AI in Australia. Sparsely-populated Australia has very strict rules for flying in people to the continent. It calculates the number of hospital beds available in a city and then distributes the same over the number of flights supposed to operate there by assuming everyone on board may need medical attention on arrival. AI is taking care of its cabin crew member quarantined in Sydney, said an official. The airline has tweaked its rules for crew members during the ongoing Covid surge in India. Since domestic flights had resumed last May, AI was giving its pilots operating them hotel stay with all meals to ensure they don’t need to leave the hotel or their room for lunch or dinner. Following the surge, it last month switched over to bed and breakfast for crew members as the Covid situation was improving. “Now we have reverted to room plus all meals for crew operating domestic flights as Covid numbers are rising sharply. This has been done for the safety of our crew members and passengers,” said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/crew-member-tests-positive-ai-flight-returns-from-sydney-with-cargo-without-passengers/articleshow/82264305.cms||Saurabh Sinha

Except for the racecourse hospital, which will have 500 beds, the others will have 2,000 beds each. These hospitals will add 800 ICU beds to the city’s existing 2,000 ICU beds. “These hospitals are also expected to have in situ oxygen plants so that there is no transportation required.

Telangana Congress working president and Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy, who campaigned in Greater Warangal municipal corporation, on Monday told people that the TRS government, which had distributed Rs 10,000 flood relief compensation in Greater Hyderabad, did not extend such a package to flood-affected families in Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation. The TRS and BJP governments respectively have failed in effectively dealing with the spread of coronavirus due to which the situation is so bad during the second wave. “But both chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are busy contesting elections when people are dying due to Covid-19 due to shortage of oxygen, ventilator-beds, vaccination and medicines,” Revanth said.

---||Pune||Armed trio rob elderly couple of booty worth Rs15.8L at Sindh society bungalow||Pune: Three masked men, including one with a knife, moved into the bungalow of a former land developer (76) at Sindh Housing Society in Aundh on Sunday night and robbed him and his wife (73) of diamond and gold ornaments, cash and US dollars, collectively worth Rs15.8 lakh. The elderly couple have been staying in the bungalow for the last 35 years. Their son and daughter live in Mumbai. The trio assaulted the elderly couple’s cook (44) and threatened them into submission. They kept them confined separately in a washroom of the master bedroom before fleeing with the robbed booty, police said. When contacted by TOI, the victim and his wife refused to comment. A little over a month ago, four armed men gagged and robbed a former teacher (80) on March 3 in her bungalow at Panchavati society in Pashan. The Sindh society ranks among the city’s upscale areas with 300 bungalows spread over 125 acres, and a network of 55 CCTV cameras and several security guards. The armed robbery between 8.30pm and 9pm has left the residents worried. Col Vikram Advani (retd), the managing committee member (security) of the society, told TOI, “Of our 55 CCTV cameras, only the one installed in front of the victim’s bungalow was not working. This is one of the rare incidents.” Deputy commissioner of police (Zone IV) Pankaj Deshmukh told TOI, “The intruders scaled the compound wall on the rear side of the society to access the bungalow. A sniffer dog, pressed into service, picked up the trail only up to ITI Road. A CCTV camera has captured images of the three men.” Senior inspector Rajkumar Waghchaure of the Chatushrungi police said, “The couple and the cook remained silent in the washroom for about an hour. Later, the woman sent a text message to her son in Mumbai and he then requested their neighbour to check the matter.” In her FIR lodged on Monday, the woman stated that she and her husband were in their first-floor room, while the cook was in the kitchen. The three robbers moved in from a glass door in the rear of their bungalow. One of them held the cook hostage at the point of a knife and slapped him. They dragged him to the first floor, asking for money,” she stated. On reaching the first floor, the armed man put the knife around the woman’s neck and asked her in Hindi for money. He grabbed her husband and again slapped the cook, prompting the woman give up and hand over the cupboard keys, a police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/armed-trio-rob-elderly-couple-of-booty-worth-rs15-8l-at-sindh-society-bungalow/articleshow/82264350.cms||Gitesh Shelke

---||Ahmedabad||‘Oxygen handling key to hospital safety’||Ahmedabad: In a matter of days, 39 patients lost their lives in two incidents in Maharashtra – while oxygen leak at Nashik choked 24 to death, a fire in Virar hospital claimed another 15 lives. Near home, in Surat a hospital had a close brush with fire disaster early on Monday. Rajesh Bhatt, chief fire officer of Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services (AFES), said that the hospitals are periodically audited for the fire safety norms. “During Covid, handling of oxygen plays a crucial role in ensuring safety. We have also intimated the hospitals about the SOPs and rules to follow,” he said. Experts said that two factors made the hospitals vulnerable. A senior fire safety auditor told TOI that majority of the hospitals had to refurbish their existing facilities to retrofit some of the facilities such as ventilator, BiPAP machine and laying of oxygen supply lines. “In several cases, the electrical load would not have been altered when the load due to equipment might have increased. It can lead to short-circuits,” he said. Experts also pointed at oxygen lines – which can convert a small spark into a disaster. All the pipes must be maintained according to the protocol for right pressure, regular cleaning and maintenance. S B Jadeja, a city-based fire safety advisor, said that there are codes and norms for hospital fire safety. “The past incidents in the state and elsewhere has taught us not to take matters of safety lightly. One must get the basics right – fire load must be assessed and addressed, electricity load must be assessed and if needed wiring must be changed. Oxygen tank or storage area must be cleared and properly demarcated,” he said. Experts also stressed on proper evacuation plan in the time of emergency. They said that several of the city-based hospitals may fail if the patients at the top floor need evacuation after a fire. “Right from water supply to emergency elevator, the equipment must be handy and functional. The self-audit and fire drills may help,” said a fire services official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/oxygen-handling-key-to-hospital-safety/articleshow/82264308.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||1,056 test +ve, positivity rate shoots up to 29% in district||Coimbatore: The district logged more than 1,000 Covid-19 cases for the third consecutive day on Monday, when 1,056 people, the highest so far, tested positive for the virus, even as 1,135 patients were discharged from various treatment centres, marginally bringing the active cases down to 6,689.While the district’s Covid-19 tally has touched 74,288, the number of recovered patients stands at 66,883. The recovery rate has, however, slipped to 90.03%, despite more than 1,000 patients getting discharged for two days in a row. Presently, the district has 1,274 people in home quarantine.The positivity rate has, meanwhile, touched an alarming high of 29.3%, mainly because just 3,596 RT-PCR tests were conducted on Sunday.The Covid-19 toll has increased to 716, with two more patients succumbing to the virus. Among the deceased was a 60-year-old man, who died a week after admission to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital. He didn’t have any comorbidities. He died of respiratory distress syndrome and bilateral bronchopneumonia. The remaining victim was a 67-year-old man, who also died of respiratory distress syndrome and bilateral bronchopneumonia at the CMCH on Saturday, within 24 hours of hospitalization.A block-wise breakup of the caseload in the past seven days shows that the number of cases within the corporation limits and Thudiyalur, which borders the city limits, has begun rising. The city limits on Monday accounted for 59.11% of the cases, an increase from the earlier 55%. Thudiyalur, meanwhile, accounted for 9.83% of the fresh cases. Madukkarai also saw a slight uptick in cases, by logging 4.7% of the total cases.A health department official said, “The blocks that account for higher caseload are Sulur, Thudiyalur and Madukkarai. These areas mainly contain lots of industries and border the corporation. As such they see heavy movement of people and dense housing.”The day also saw the ESI Hospital completely running out of beds. The hospital said all its 680 beds have been occupied. The CMCH, however, increased its bed allotment for the Covid-19 patients to 1,045 from 865 on the day. The hospital said 523 beds were occupied and another 522 were vacant.The Pollachi government hospital and the Hindusthan Hospital at Mettupalayam had 96 and 28 vacant beds, respectively. In all, 686 beds are still available in the government sector, and 189 of them have oxygen and ventilator support.While the private hospitals together have 3,139 beds, 2,267 of them are occupied. There are still 872 beds available with hospitals like KMCH, Ramakrishna Hospital, GKNM and Karpagam Medical College Hospital.On the vaccination front, 8,164 people were inoculated on the day. The district has a stock of 21,200 vaccine doses, which is expected to last until Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/1056-test-ve-positivity-rate-shoots-up-to-29-in-district/articleshow/82264313.cms||---

Appearing for the petitioners, senior counsel B Chandrasen Reddy told the court that the case was booked against them in 2016 and the assets they attached now were acquired by the petitioners in 1970 and in 2014 much before the registration of the current case. “It is absurd to call them proceeds of crime,” he said citing the judgments of various courts that such properties cannot be called as proceeds of crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-stays-eds-attachment-of-musaddilals-assets/articleshow/82264314.cms||---
---||Mumbai||‘Alcohol in air due to sanitiser use & curtains fuelled Virar hospital fire’||MUMBAI: The presence of large amounts of alcohol in the air inside the ICU because of excessive use of sanitisers, and huge curtains surrounding patients that blocked cross-ventilation contributed immensely to the fire at Vijay Vallabh hospital in Virar on Friday, in which 15 patients were charred to death, said fire expert Nilesh Ukunde, reports Sandhya Nair. Ukunde, a certified forensic fire investigator heading the fire audit team in Nagpur district, visited the hospital on Sunday and said all Covid hospitals are using sanitisers on hands, for patients and cleaning floors. A similar fire was reported in the ICU of a private hospital in Wadi, Nagpur, on April 9, killing 4 Covid patients. “Huge quantity of alcohol from the sanitizers are released in the atmosphere of the ICU/wards. Being lighter, it settles up on the ceiling forming a layer. If there’s no cross-ventilation, the alcohol stays up there and in case of a short circuit, the presence of alcohol in the air results in a flashover, engulfing whatever comes in its way within a fraction of seconds,” said Ukunde. In the Virar hospital fire, a short circuit in the electrical power wiring of the air-conditioner placed above the nurse station of the ICU caused continuous sparks. The nurse jumped out of the cubicle located at the centre of the ICU as the pathway was flooded with sparks from above, said Ukunde. The heat from the sparks expanded, got mixed with the alcohol and an explosion occured, engulfing the beds. The release of oxygen in the ICU (after the fire) from airpipes that were either disconnected from the patients’ nose or got melted aggravated the fire. A large number of curtains surrounding patients also contributed immensely to the disaster, explained Ukunde. He said curtains around patients in the ICU should be done away with immediately. The hospital ICU did not have any cross ventilation. He said all Covid hospitals should make provision to have natural or forced cross ventilation (fan, exhaust) so that air in the upper level of the ceiling can be blown out regularly. The fire expert said the Virar hospital ICU had only one door for entry and exit which was a problem in itself. He said there is always a reluctance among medical and electrical staff to enter wards and ICU having Covid patients. “Any rescue in Covid wards is delayed as rescuers fear getting Covid if they come in contact with a patientHospitals should keep surgical masks and facial shields outside ICUs and wards in case a rescue task has to be performed,” said Ukunde.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/alcohol-in-air-due-to-sanitiser-use-curtains-fuelled-virar-hospital-fire/articleshow/82265908.cms||Sandhya Nair

He alleged that two CPM leaders, a district secretariat member and a municipal councillor from Panoor, cleaned up the house of the arrested DYFI activist Suhail, raising suspicion that it was aimed at destroying evidence. “Residents suspect that the bomb that was hurled at Mansoor was manufactured at the house of Suhail. We had informed the police about the incident and they had said that they would look into it. The police should arrest the two leaders,” he said. Firos added that the investigation into the suspicious death of Ratheesh, the second accused in the case, was also not moving forward.  “There is suspicion that Ratheesh was murdered following fear that the role of CPM leaders in Mansoor murder case would come out. CPM is not allowing even media persons to visit the house of Ratheesh and speak to his relatives,” Firos added. MYL state vice-president PK Subair and Kannur district MYL general secretary Sameer Parambath also attended the news conference. Crime Branch team probing the case has arrested eight accused in the case. As per the FIR, there are 25 accused in the case, including 11 identifiable accused who participated in the attack.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/myl-cpm-exerting-pressure-on-cops/articleshow/82263659.cms||---

Disclosing this here on Monday, a spokesperson of the chief minister’s office said the Punjab Infrastructure Development Board (PIDB) being the nodal agency of the state has been authorised for taking necessary action in this regard. The spokesperson said the general administration department intends to develop and operate circuit houses at Ludhiana and Jalandhar on public-private partnership (PPP) mode to be operated as circuit houses-cum-hotels. The general administration department operates 10 circuit houses in Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Bathinda, Ferozepur, Faridkot, Patiala, Gurdaspur, Chandigarh and Shimla. In addition, there are two Punjab Bhawans in New Delhi and Chandigarh. These circuit houses were developed for the stay of government officers/officials visiting different district headquarters for official work. However, over a period of time on account of recurrent expenditure on maintenance and updating of the facilities of circuit houses lead to financial burden on the state government. Further, the quality of services has also gone down significantly. High fixed costs apportioned over significantly lower capacity translates into poor economics on account of high operating expenses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/3-circuit-houses-to-be-run-as-hotels-in-ppp-mode/articleshow/82265906.cms||---

This year, the police had rejected permission to hold the procession in view of the pandemic. Two organisations had approached the court challenging the decision of the police. They informed the court that though they had applied for permission, the police dodged the issue till the last minute and rejected it on Monday denying permission for holding the rally on Tuesday. The judge allowed the plea and directed the police to permit the petitioners to take out the procession with 21 persons. They can take out a bike rally. The procession can be held from 9am to 1pm and should be videographed, the judge said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-allows-hanuman-yatra-with-21-devotees-wants-it-videographed/articleshow/82264363.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Balasundaram of Ellaithottam Road in Peelamedu and Mithun, a guest worker, killed the dog by beating it using a wooden log and buried the carcass, honorary district animal welfare officer of the Animal Welfare Board of India Pradeep Prabhakaran said.“Balasundaram did not like the dog, which was very active and had approached some youths in the locality, asking them to kill it. However, the youths told him to approach the city municipal corporation to capture the dog. With the help of Mithun, Balasundaram tied the dog to a tree and thrashed it using a wooden log. After killing it, they buried the carcass. When the youths questioned him for killing the dog, Balasundaram contacted the city police control room and claimed that he was harassed by the youths,” Prabhakaran said. Peelamedu police inspector R Vivekanandan booked Balasundaram and Mithun under Section 429 (mischief by killing or maiming cattle etc.,) of the Indian Penal Code and 11 (1) (i) of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960.

---||Kolkata||2020 Bhowanipore C-zones see turnout drop in 2021||Kolkata: The fear of contracting the novel coronavirus kept a high number of Bhowanipore voters away from polling booths on Monday. The constituency registered a turnout of 60%, the lowest in the past 4 elections. The neighbourhood, which had remained under containment for the longest time last year, still reportedly had around 10,000 residents, who are either down with Covid-19, or were in isolation. Several elderly residents also refused to step out this time. “My father missed his vote for the first time. He is still active and can walk around but three months ago, he had a surgery and I did not want to expose him to a crowded place, like a voting booth, in this Covid surge,” said Bhola Das, a resident of Chakraberia. In a joint family at Paddapukur Road, three had just recovered from Covid-19, while two others were still recuperating at home. “I know there is a provision for last-hour voting for Covid patients and those in isolation. But we still did not want to risk our lives,” said one of the patients. Local medicine shop owners said the current scene was evident from the sales of medicines, oximeters and vaporizers. “Panic buying has returned here in the past 10 days and several people in our area are getting infected again. Just like containment zone days, we have again started home delivery of medicines,” said Sujoy Samaddar of Sanjivani Medicines in Chakraberia. No major crowd was noticed at booths on Jogesh Mitra Road, Balaram Bose Lane and Abhay Sarkar Lane for most part of the day. While a booth on Jogesh Mitra Road registered only 429 out of 810 votes, another booth at Seventh Day Adventists Church on Park Street recorded 610 of 1,030 votes. Mitra Institution, where chief minister Mamata Banerjee voted, recorded 397 out of 605 votes. Alarmed by the low turnout, BJP candidate Rudranil Ghosh made rounds of the constituency, asking his party workers to urge their acquaintances to vote. “The TMC has made a panic campaign here that the moment one comes out, he/she will be affected by Covid-19. But we are trying our best, urging people to exercise their democratic right, maintaining all Covid protocol,” said Ghosh. Trinamool’s Sovandeb Chattopadhyay seemed confident and said his party was not forcing anyone to drop their guard. “Everyone should vote but we can’t force anyone during these testing times. I am maintaining safety protocol and avoiding eating outside or shaking hands even with party workers,” said a masked Chattopadhyay, sanitizing his hands often. —inputs by Sudipto Das||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2020-bhowanipore-c-zones-see-turnout-drop-in-2021/articleshow/82264375.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Chandigarh||Will end syndicate system to end exploitation of transporters: SAD||Chandigarh: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Monday announced its transport wing even as it promised to end the ‘syndicate system’ enforced by the Congress government in Punjab after breaking transport unions, besides ensuring to take one tax from truckers to end their exploitation at the hands of various departments. Addressing a press conference here, former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra said the Congress government had handed over the transport trade to its henchmen by breaking transport unions and creating syndicates. He alleged that there was a lot of corruption in auction of new sites and mediators were ruling the roost at the cost of genuine transporters. Chandumajra said once the SAD formed a government in the state, it would end the monopoly of the syndicates and form joint committees in every sub-division which would be presided over by truck union and industry representatives, besides the sub-divisional magistrate. “These committees will ensure transparent functioning,” he said, adding outside trucks would not be allowed in the defined areas of each committee. He also announced that at present there were a plethora of taxes which caused harassment to truckers. He said once the SAD formed the government it would bring all taxes under one banner and issue a sticker to ensure trucks were not stopped on the roads. “No one will have the authority to stop trucks on the roads,” he added. SAD transport wing got new office-bearers in Parmjit Singh Fazilka as president and Gurwinder Singh Binder Manila as secretary general. Robin new SOI chief Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal has appointed Arshdeep Singh Robin Brar as the president of Student Organisation of India (SOI). Disclosing this in a statement released from party head office here on Monday, Charanjit Singh Brar said that Robin has remained president of SOI Malwa zone for two terms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/will-end-syndicate-system-to-end-exploitation-of-transporters-sad/articleshow/82265907.cms||---
---||Delhi||Covid-19 Deaths At Home: Unclear Rules Cause More Despair For Kin||New Delhi: While a lack of beds in hospitals is forcing even serious patients to undergo treatment at home, the absence of a clear communication on the standard operating procedure for funerals in such deaths is increasing the suffering of loved ones. Also, many such funerals are ultimately being carried out as non-Covid procedures, further increasing the risk of infection. Funeral managers at Covid-designated centres say they are reeling under the sheer number of fatalities over the past few days. A senior official from the public health department said that, in such cases, relatives should contact the nearest Covid-designated funeral centre and ask for a hearse van with body bags. “They will be guided by the NGO operating the funeral centre about disinfection and other formalities, depending on the availability of resources,” he said. Another official overseeing the management of Covid-protocol cremations said one should contact the district magistrate office or the district surveillance officer in case of a Covid death at home. In reality, things are not that simple. The lack of a widely publicised coordination point has resulted in families running from pillar to post for information. “We have been to hospitals, police stations and government offices, but there is no clarity on the process. Each site directs you to another,” a relative with a first-hand experience of the hardship told TOI. An official in charge of a major cremation ground said the number of non-Covid funerals had gone up exponentially as the last rites of several Covid victims were being carried out under the normal category. “Which hospital is currently in a state to certify the cause of death and follow all the procedures?” he asked. Jitender Singh Shunty, who operates the Seemapuri cremation facility where a majority of funerals in east Delhi are taking place, said the whole system had collapsed. “Covid victims are being cremated like anyone else. Earlier, we used to receive 7-10 bodies a day. Now, we are getting 50 Covid-protocol bodies while more than 100 cremations are taking place,” he said. North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash said there were no clear directions on the cremation of people dying in home isolation. “Even Covid victims are being cremated under the normal category. I am writing to the CM to direct the district teams to track people in home isolation and give us details about their deaths. If such a list is provided daily and a clear system is developed, it will reduce the chances of infection spreading at the funeral sites.,” he said. Data from Nigambodh Ghat shows that cremations under the normal category have gone up from 35-36 a day in the beginning of April 1 to 125-126 now. East Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Nirmal Jain, however, said those dying at home could be taken to any crematorium. “In case of any trouble, the family can dial the mayor helpline,” Jain said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-19-deaths-at-home-unclear-rules-cause-more-despair-for-kin/articleshow/82264367.cms||Paras Singh
---||Delhi||1,200 more Covid ICU beds to be ready by May 10: CM||New Delhi: In two weeks, the capital will get 1,200 more ICU beds for Covid-19 patients, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Tuesday. The current wave of Covid-19 cases is extremely dangerous and contagious and the hospitals are overloaded, the chief minister said during a digital press conference. To combat the load, he added, the 1,200 ICU beds will be ready by May 10. “The central government arranged 500 ICU beds at DRDO and within three hours of us making an official public announcement of their availability, all were full. This is the nature of the second wave,” he pointed out. “Today I visited Ramlila Maidan in front of GTB Hospital. We are trying to convert that into an ICU centre with a capacity of 500 beds. The main Maidan in front of LNJP Hospital is also being converted into an ICU bed centre with 500 beds,” he said, adding that 200 ICU beds are also being readied at Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre at Radha Soami Satsang Beas. “It has been noticed that the current wave is particularly dangerous. It is supremely contagious and those who are contracting it are not able to recover as swiftly as was noticed in the previous wave. In these conditions, ICU wards are in great demand,” the chief minister said. Despite the government’s best efforts, it is becoming difficult to create more ICU beds, he admitted. “All hospitals at this point are running over and above their real capacity, beds are full, including ICU beds.” Kejriwal said the new ICU beds “will relieve the load from the hospitals and help the people of Delhi. We are continuously working towards increasing the health capacities of the state and ensuring help reaches the person who needs it”. Delhi government, he said, is “working hand in hand with everyone — the central and state governments, industrialists, social and religious organisations, and more. I believe that by working together, we will be able to defeat this second wave as well”. The mayor of North Delhi Municipal Corporation, Jai Prakash, on Tuesday said the civic body had provided Ramlila Maidan to Delhi government for developing a Covid hospital there. He said the north corporation would extend all possible help required by the government. Jai Prakash also said the corporation had already developed Hindu Rao Hospital and RBIPMT into Covid treatment facilities while a third hospital, Balak Ram, was also being developed to cater to Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/1200-more-covid-icu-beds-to-be-ready-by-may-10-cm/articleshow/82281978.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||If doses not enough, won’t start vax for 18+ on May 1 in Mumbai, says BMC chief||MUMBAI: Unless the city was assured of adequate vaccine doses for the population in the 18-44 age group by the state government, the BMC may not roll out the drive on May 1, said municipal chief I S Chahal. At the state-level, principal health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas said it was a “policy under discussion” whether the drive will kickstart in Maharashtra on May 1. “We have always aimed at vaccinating one lakh a day, but have not been able to touch the target. I have therefore taken it up with the state government that we would like to begin the mass vaccination drive only once there is enough availability of vaccines for all,” Chahal told TOI. The BMC commissioner said he was willing to face criticism for his stand, but it “was practical”. Mumbai has an estimated 50-60 lakh population that falls in the 18-44 age bracket, and hence the tentative doses required would be 1.2 crore. Chahal pointed out that the BMC cannot procure vaccines by itself. “Hence, until we are assured of adequate supply for all, we would want to continue vaccinating only those in the 45-plus category,” he said, once again underlining that there was no point in asking everyone to come on road if there were no vaccines. Chahal said the state government was already in talks with vaccine manufacturers for procurement. The state’s public health department on Monday wrote to Bharat Biotech, makers of Covaxin, enquiring about the number of doses they would be able to provide for the next six months and the likely cost. Dr Vyas wrote that if Maharashtra decides to vaccinate the population between l8 to 44 years, then about 12 crore doses would be required. “...we would like you to inform us as to how many doses of Covaxin you would be in a position to supply to Maharashtra every month for next six months beginning May 2021,” the letter stated. The government has also asked the company to suggest procurement price per dose and other conditions, if any. “An early response is requested, so a suitable decision can be taken by the government,” the letter read. Last week, CM Uddhav Thackeray had preliminary talks with Serum Institute of India to find out how many Covishield doses the Pune-based company would be able to supply. Incidentally, both companies have made their selling rates public, but the state is hoping to get a more discounted price because of the big volumes. The Centre on Monday asked Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech to reconsider their prices. Bharat Biotech has fixed the price of Covaxin at Rs 600 per dose for state governments and Rs 1,200 for private hospitals, while Serum Institute has fixed Covishield price at Rs 400 and Rs 600 per dose, respectively. Even as a big question hangs about doses, the BMC held its first meeting on preparedness on Monday. “We have decided to ask all 227 corporators to get private hospitals in their wards to apply for setting up a vaccination centre. In addition, the 172 hospitals already on Covid duty would also be asked to administer the vaccine,” Chahal said. The BMC said private hospitals willing to come on board must have a cold chain for vaccine storage, enough space for the beneficiaries, skilled manpower and a team capable of tackling adverse events.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-if-doses-not-enough-wont-start-vax-for-18-on-may-1-says-bmc-chief/articleshow/82265296.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Kochi||RFP issued to eight firms for consultancy||Thiruvananthapuram: The state government has issued request for proposal (RFP) for selection of project management consultancy (PMC) for Kerala state solid waste management project (KSSWMP) to eight firms which were earlier shortlisted. The total project cost of KSWMP is $300 million, of which $210 million (70%) is to be financed by the World Bank and the remaining $90 million from the state budget. Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India LLP, Ernst & Young LLP, InfraEn (India) Pvt Ltd, IPE Global Ltd, KPMG Advisory Services Pvt Ltd, Mott MacDonald, Tata Consulting Engineers Ltd and URS Scott Wilson India Pvt Ltd are the firms which have been shortlisted and to which RFP has been issued. The companies formed joint ventures with various other firms to participate in the bid. KPMG Advisory Services which is also among the shortlisted firms was selected in 2020 for project management support services (PMSS) for Rebuild Kerala Initiative (RKI). The state government approved the project management consultancy for the World Bank-funded waste management project at Rs 120 crore. The project is expected to be implemented in 87 municipalities among the 93 urban local bodies. Suchitwa Mission, the implementing agency of the project, had published an expression of interest (EoI) for hiring PMCs in August 2020. At that time, 22 firms had submitted EoI. The evaluation committee convened in September 2020 verified the projects submitted by the firms and found that most of them submitted details of projects than what was required in REoI. In most cases, the completion and acceptance certificates were not attached, as per the report of the project director of KSSWMP. The project director reported that the committee was unable to arrive at a decision on shortlisting agencies based on the details of projects submitted by the firms and the committee decided to seek a clarification from them. All the firms were directed to furnish the details of most suitable projects along with supporting documents among the list of projects already submitted, and 14 agencies submitted their responses. The project director, KSSWMP reported that the responses received from the firms were further evaluated by the evaluation committee in October 2020. It was reported that in many of the cases, the projects submitted by the firms did not conform to the eligibility criteria. The evaluation committee then decided to relax the existing eligibility criteria for further shortlisting. The project director requested the government to approve the evaluation committee’s recommendations for relaxing the criteria specified and to ratify the shortlisting of the eight firms for consultancy services. As per the RFP, the firm will be chosen based on quality and cost-based selection procedure (QCBS).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rfp-issued-to-eight-firms-for-consultancy/articleshow/82263681.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The incident came to light on April 25 morning, when the temple’s priest Bharat Kota (40) saw the shrine’s lock had been broken. Kota, who stays near the temple, alerted the police and later lodged an FIR. Assistant police inspector Hemachandra Khopade of Samarth police station said, “The temple is in the parking area of a housing society. It is surrounded by four buildings. Earlier, the temple was a part of a ‘wada’ and a few years ago, four buildings were constructed there.” He said the thieves broke open the lock of the front door, stole silver ornaments of the deity and some cash from the donation box. “The amount stolen from the donation box is not known. The suspects also stole the video recording unit attached to the CCTV cameras, following which they fled. So, it is not known how many thieves were there and at what time they broke open the lock,” he added. The police are also looking for CCTV camera footage from the neighbouring establishments to ascertain the identity of the thieves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/valuables-cctv-camera-video-recorder-stolen-from-temple/articleshow/82264381.cms||---

I worked as a sweeper. We had no children. My brothers, who were more educated, were employed in Tangedco and the agriculture department. After my husband passed away, I didn’t want to become a burden to my brothers' children and decided to spend my remaining days in the company of God.”The septuagenarian, known as Naai Kezhavi in the locality, uses her old-age pension to pay rent and gets food from the temple. “I used to feed the dogs leftovers. Gradually, they warmed up to me and began to accompany me. I feel happy and fulfilled when they eat from my plate.”Gowri spends at least Rs 100 a day to feed 20 street dogs, said temple barber Palaniswami. “She buys milk, eggs, dry fish and cooks ration rice at her house for the dogs. She feeds the dogs twice a day. She sends for the government veterinarian if any of the dogs are sick and buys medicines for them also.”While she spends the morning begging and feeding dogs near the Perur tank, in the evening, Gowri takes care of dogs near the Perur temple. Recently, NGO Voice for Street Warriors gave Gowri a phone. “I now have regular donors, who give Rs 100 to Rs 150 a day because they know I take care of the stray dogs.”But she is worried about the panchayat workers, residents and temple staff, who are trying to reduce stray dog population in the area. “They often threaten and harass me demanding that I stop feeding the dogs and even hit me,” she said. “But nothing stops me.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/poor-but-rich-at-heart-naai-kezhavi-feeds-stray-dogs/articleshow/82264361.cms||---

The project, originally approved in 2013 and due for completion by 2019, was later extended to April 2021. The restructuring will enable disbursing of the final payment of $25 million. Otherwise, it will be an additional fiscal burden to Kerala government, at a time when additional resources would be needed to manage the effects of the pandemic, said World Bank in its restructuring proposal. The original project’s development objective was to improve the condition, traffic flow and road safety with a focus on vulnerable road users on select roads in Kerala. However, it was later modified and added: “to enhance resilience to climate change and disaster risk”. “The project’s total road length is 408 km; 281km under component A1, 52km under A2 and 75km under Component D. The project has substantially completed 281km under Component A1. The remaining roads are in progress but will be completed after the current loan closing date of April 30, 2021. The proposed restructuring will support state government’s commitment towards financing the balance of the activities beyond the closing date, thus ensuring that the project PDO is met,” the restructuring paper said. “ All road network upgrading and safety improvement contracts have been awarded, albeit with some procurement delays for EPC packages under sub-component A2. While most of the civil works have been completed, not all activities will be finalized by the time the project closes on April 30, 2021. Current disbursement amounts to $145.86 million with a balance of $50.14 million yet to be disbursed. It is estimated that by the time the project closes, about $25 million of the remaining balance would not be disbursed. The purpose of the proposed restructuring is to ensure that the full amount of the loan is fully disbursed,” the restructuring paper noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/wb-restructures-kstp-ii-project/articleshow/82263673.cms||Shenoy Karun
---||Coimbatore||Flower market to function from Shastri Maidan||Coimbatore: The city corporation sealed the old and new flower markets on Mettupalayam Road on Monday.Flower vendors are expected to function from Shastri Maidan on Arokiasamy Road at RS Puram from Tuesday. “As many as 135 stage shops and 28 stall shops were functioning in the flower markets. The civic body decided to close the markets as it was difficult to control the crowd. Subsequently, entry to both the markets were sealed with metal sheets on Monday,” a statement from the corporation said.Earlier that day, flower vendors approached corporation officials and requested them to allow them continue business from the markets. They promised to follow Covid-19 guidelines.“Shastri ground lacks basic facilities including drinking water and toilets. As there are no roof, it is impossible for us to sit under the scorching sun. Flowers will wither in the heat. Our business would be affected as the place lacks direct bus connection,” a flower vendor told TOI. “After the state government closed temples and restricted the number of people attending marriages and other functions, we are facing severe loss. If we are moved to another place, our business would be affected. That’s why we requested them to allow us to function from the markets.”K Ayyapan, trustee of Kovai District Flower Merchant Association said that the corporation convinced the vendors to shift to Shastri Maidan. “We have decided to function from the ground from Tuesday. Details like the number of shops are yet to be decided,” he said.A week ago, the civic body had allowed 60 flower vendors to function also from new flower market opposite to the old one as a preventive measure to contain the spread of Covid-19. As the footfall at the markets remained high, corporation officials decided to close them and instead allowed the vendors to function from Shastri Maidan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/flower-market-to-function-from-shastri-maidan/articleshow/82264374.cms||---

With his only daughter living in the US and 76-year-old wife having tested positive, there was no one to perform his last rites. Finding no alternative, SI Murari from DBG Road police station arranged for everything at the Panchkuiyan Road cremation ground. On April 24, the wife also passed away. Again, Murari volunteered and took responsibility for the cremation. While the Covid-19 crisis is making many abandon even their dead relatives, Delhi Police personnel have been volunteering to perform the last rites of such Covid victims. In another case, a lieutenant colonel posted in Leh sought police’s help for cremation of his father-in-law who died due to Covid-19 in the city. According to an official, no one was willing to help them for cremation and even space was not available at the nearby crematorium. Constable Rajesh and others then stepped forward and performed the last rites as per rituals, a gesture that was highly appreciated by the family. A woman went to visit her brother at Dwarka’s Sector 7. She tested positive and later passed away. SHO Dwarka (south) Balbir Singh and others found there was nobody to take responsibility of her cremation. The cops then took the body to a cremation ground in Dwarka where the last rites were performed. On April 25, a 52-year-old woman living alone had passed away at her house. “Neighbours informed us that she had no children and her husband had died years ago. When her other family members were contacted, they expressed their inability to come from Kanpur to receive the body,” said a senior official. Police then ensured a dignified cremation for her at a Kalkaji centre. “The Covid-19 crisis is even making many abandon their dead relatives. In some cases, the kin can’t travel to bid final goodbye to people living alone in the capital. However, Delhi Police personnel have been volunteering to help in the cremation and performing last rites of many such people,” PRO Chinmoy Biswal said. Cops from Civil Lines and Sarai Rohilla police stations also ensured a dignified funeral for some Covid victims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-volunteer-to-give-covid-victims-dignified-farewell/articleshow/82264403.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Mall, cinema operators stare at bleak future||Coimbatore: All malls, shopping complexes, theatres, gyms, bars and other recreational facilities were closed in the district on Monday after the state government tightened lockdown measures in response to concerns about new variants of virus.The move dealt a big blow to businessmen, who are struggling to recover from the impact of last year’s lockdown. M Subramaniam, president of Tamil Nadu Theatre and Multiplex Owners’ Association, said the owners had been receiving good response ever since theatres were permitted to operate and had been making enough money to meet expenses. “Even though we were allowed to operate only with 50% occupancy, the revenue generated reduced our financial burden significantly. But now, we are staring at an uncertain future,” he said. As many as 50,000 workers are depending on the industry in the state, Subramaniam said. “We plan to request the government to waive land tax, property tax and allow us pay minimum electricity tariff at least for a few months.”Due to the night curfew, theatres had reduced the number of shows from four to three last week. The impact varies depending upon locations and size of theatres, said K Rajamannar, president of the Coimbatore, Tirupur, Nilgiris and Erode Distributors Association. “Even though it is difficult, we have no other option but to survive through the pandemic.”Footfall at the Brookefields Mall was increasing gradually after it was reopened seven months ago and touched 70% last month, said Ashwin Balasubramaniam, chief operating officer. “In fact, revenue generation was 10% higher than the footfall. Now, the closure has come as a blow to us. It will be unmanageable if lockdown is extended for another few months.” Justin, marketing manager of Prozone Mall, said it would have a significant impact on the business. “We have to disburse salary to employees and carry out regular maintenance work even if the mall remains closed. It would cost lakhs. After the last lockdown, we decided to extend time to pay rent, waived off rent and revised revenue sharing system to ensure uninterrupted operations. Now, we don’t know how long the closure will be. If it is extended for months, shops might move out of the mall,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/mall-cinema-operators-stare-at-bleak-future/articleshow/82264380.cms||Nivedha Selvam

It is feared that 11 crew members, along with owner Joseph Frangline, have drowned. The vessel had sent an SOS to another boat ‘Peirya Nayahi’ which found the wreck close to Oman. “Since the incident happened 600 nautical miles away from Indian coast, the search and rescue operation is difficult from the Indian side. Though a coast guard vessel Samudra Prahari is already engaged in rescue operation, that vessel has not yet reached the spot. We request Indian government to seek air support from the Navy for rescue. The ship which hit the fishing vessel should be identified,” said Charles George, president of the association. Though the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea was approved by India as a signatory, and Indian Maritime Zone Act was enacted in 1981, law and rules for fishing in Indian EEZ and areas beyond natural jurisdiction and adjacent areas have not been implemented. It should be done at the earliest and it should protect the fishing right of fish workers, the association said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/assn-seeks-mins-help-to-locate-boat/articleshow/82263687.cms||---

As per Maharashtra Civil Services (Declaration of Small Family) Rules, a person is not eligible for a government job if he/she has more than two children after 2005. It was found that she suppressed crucial information on number of children. A four-page order promulgated by deputy secretary Narayan Karad had stated details of a departmental probe against her, as well as recommendations of additional director general of prisons and recommendation of MPSC to dismiss her. On a written complaint by a social worker on January 11, 2016, a high-level probe was initiated in September 2019 against Jogdand, who was selected by MPSC on a post reserved for a woman, and joined as jail superintendent on March 1, 2012. The complainant said she has three children and suppressed crucial information before joining service. As per civil service rules, 1993, if a person submits false information to secure a government job, that person should be dismissed. Karad’s order said the probe was initiated on September 6, 2019 and the inquiry officer confirmed the charges and submitted his report to government on June 20, 2019. As per small family rules, as a social measure to control population, the state government decided not to appoint anyone if he/she has more than two children. The departmental probe found Jogdand had three children before she joined service, and the date of birth of her third child was March 29, 2007. In submissions before the inquiry officer on December 23, 2015, she claimed she had two daughters, giving false information. The inquiry officer’s report was given to Jogdand on August 20, 2019. Jogdand urged the government to take a lenient view and she should be given a relaxation from small family rules. “There is no provision for relaxing rules.

Moreover, the information as regards the alleged secret documents is not forthcoming and despite specific directions issued by the coordinate bench of this court in this regard, no compliance was done. Thus, no useful purpose would be served by keeping the petitioner behind the bars,” observed Justice Harnaresh Singh Gill of the high court as he passed these orders allowing a petition for bail filed by Sukhwinder Singh, alias Sukha, a native of Moga who had been arrested in Faridkot. Sukha was arrested in connection with an FIR registered on June 29, 2019, under various sections of the Official Secrets Act and Section 120B (criminal conspiracy) under IPC at Faridkot city police station in Punjab. He had allegedly sent information about locations of military units, weapons of the Army, and other documents relating to the Army due to which there was a threat to the security of the nation. As per the police, the information was passed to ISI by him through WhatsApp. The counsel for the petitioner, Ramandeep Singh Gill submitted that as per the FIR, the petitioner was apprehended with secret documents related to the security of the Indian Army. He stated that vide order dated September 10, 2020, passed by a coordinate bench of this court, the state counsel was directed to address in the reply, the issue as to what were the secret documents recovered from the petitioner’s possession. But till date, no such details have been placed on record nor the sanction of the appropriate government under Section 13(3) of the Official Secrets Act, 1923 has been obtained/received. It was stated that the petitioner is 60% physically disabled from his right leg and that no other case is pending or registered against the petitioner. Moreover, the petitioner has been in custody since June 2019. Objecting to the bail plea, the Punjab government submitted that there are serious allegations against the petitioner that he was in touch with the Pakistani citizens, namely Ali Raza and Javed Malik, and used to supply them the secret information about the Indian Army. The government said that it had sought sanction from the central government on August 28, 2020 and the same is still awaited. After hearing both the parties, the HC ordered Sukha’s release on regular bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-grants-bail-to-suspected-spy-after-police-fail-to-produce-secret-info-recovered-from-him/articleshow/82265909.cms||Ajay Sura

The new 250-bed facility will be inaugurated at Hazira on Tuesday by chief minister Vijay Rupani in the presence of ArcelorMittal group chairman L N Mittal by video conferencing. It will be scaled rapidly to a 1,000-bed centre for treating Covid-19 patients, said sources close to the development. Earlier, the facility was to be inaugurated sometime in the first week of May. However, looking at the current situation in Gujarat, a decision to roll out the facility immediately was taken at a late-night meeting between senior officials of AM/NS India and the chief minister’ office, said sources in the state government. The facility is being created by converting an existing building of AM/NS India in Hazira near Surat into a Covid-19 centre, said sources. “To utilize the full potential of our industry and to provide quick solutions to meet the demand of oxygen in the coming days, AM/NS India in alliance with the Surat district administration and Gujarat government is setting up a 250-bed Covid-19 facility at Hazira in 72 hours. It will receive uninterrupted supply of oxygen gas from our Hazira plant. This is first of its kind facility globally,” said an industry official close to the development. Others present at the online inauguration on Tuesday include Dilip Oommen, Chief Executive Officer, AM/NS India and M K Das, additional chief secretary (ACS), industry and mines and ACS to CM. Last week, AM/NS India announced supply of 200 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen per day to medical facilities in Gujarat. The supply of this crucial medical requirement from the company’s oxygen plant in Hazira is being operated in partnership with INOX Air Products, it said. At a time when Covid-19 situation is turning into a catastrophe in Gujarat, many industries have stepped up to give their support. Last week, Union home minister Amit Shah announced that Tata Trusts will set up a 1,200-bed hospital for Covid patients in Gandhinagar. He also visited the 900-bed Covid facility set up with by the state government in collaboration with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) at GMDC ground in Ahmedabad. Gujarat’s Covid-19 tally crossed the 5 lakh-mark on Monday to reach 5,10,373 with the addition of 14,340 new cases, the highest rise in a single day so far. With a record 158 fatalities in a day, the Covid-19 toll in Gujarat rose to 6,486, according to the state’s health department. At 5,679, Ahmedabad reported the highest number of fresh cases in the state in the day and 27 fatalities, also the highest in the state.

---||Coimbatore||Fatal accidents, traffic violations go up in city||Coimbatore: The city police have booked 3.76 lakh traffic violation cases and imposed Rs4.98 crore fine on the offenders from January 1 to April 25 this year. At least 27 people were killed in as many fatal accidents during the period.As per the Madras high court order, the city traffic police have been focusing more on motorists jumping red light at traffic signals, speeding their vehicles, using mobile phones while driving, carrying passengers in goods vehicles and carrying overload in goods vehicles. While drunk driving was also a special focus area, police were avoiding them because of the practical difficulties in booking them given the Covid-19 situation.R Mutharasu, city deputy commissioner of police (traffic), said, “We have booked 69,836 cases in the above five categories during the period, compared to 50,268 (which includes drunken driving cases) in the comparable period last year. Another 3,06,505 cases were registered for not wearing seat belts and helmets until Sunday, against 2,20,041 last year.”The fine imposed on the traffic violators has also gone up to Rs4,98,31,660 this year, from Rs3,74,28,300 last year.The officer said 15 traffic police teams were formed in the city to conduct vehicle checks and book the offenders.The fatal accidents during the period have, meanwhile, increased to 27 in the city from 20 last year. While 27 people have lost their lives this year, only 20 had died the same period previous year. “Only one fatal accident was reported in April 2020, as the total lockdown was in force. In comparison, six fatal accidents have been reported so far this April,” Mutharasu said.The officer said they had stopped booking drunken driving cases for the past one year, because of the pandemic situation. It is to be noted that around 900 cases of drunken driving were registered from January 2020 to March 15, 2020.Pointing out that doctors had made RT-PCR test mandatory for the motorists who they catch for drunken driving, a police source said, “The test results would be declared only after 24 to 36 hours. Collecting blood samples from the drunken driving suspects after such a delay is of no use. Hence, we have stopped booking drunken driving cases completely.”During the total lockdown on Sunday, the city police had booked 392 traffic violation cases and seized 40 motorcycles for triple riding. “Many youths were roaming on motorcycles to see the empty streets during the total lockdown. We have seized their motorcycles,” Mutharasu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/fatal-accidents-traffic-violations-go-up-in-city/articleshow/82264413.cms||A Subburaj
---||Kochi||Kochi: AIMS sets up centre for haemophilia patients||KOCHI: To help haemophilia patients live a near normal life, the Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences (AIMS) has set up a radiosynovectomy centre for haemophilia patients with chronic synovitis. The centre is said to be the the first-of-its kind in Kerala and second one in India after CMC Vellore. Haemophilia is a bleeding disorder due to deficiency of clotting factor 8 or 9. The patient bleeds into their joints as frequent as 3 to 5 times a month and are incapacitated by the pain and swelling. Ideally, this treatment is indicated for patients between ages 10 and 25 who bleed even with factor replacement. There are around 1,500 haemophilia patients in the state. A team of haematologists led by Dr Neeraj Sidharthan, clinical professor of clinical haematology, will be looking after the ancillary care of the haemophilia patients, including administration of deficient factor replacement and supportive care. “It has been proven to be as effective as surgical synovectomy in patients without deformities. It is more economical, less painful and can be repeated if required. It reduces the bleed rate by 60 to 80% in the injected joint and improves the patient’s quality of life,” said Dr Nittu Devassy Panjikaran, assistant professor, physical medicine and rehabilitation, AIMS, who is handling the facility. Radiosynovectomy is an outpatient based procedure performed by giving an injection of Yttrium-90, a radioactive material procured from France, into the affected joint under local anaesthesia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/aims-sets-up-centre-for-haemophilia-patients/articleshow/82263695.cms||---

Manish Hindvi, a faculty member at Vidyant PG College, is one such person who not only gave an oxygen cylinder reserved for his parents but also borrowed a cylinder from an associate to save the life of another man. Associate professor at Karamat Husain Muslim Girls’ PG College, Ishrat Jahan, was struggling to arrange an oxygen cylinder for her husband Faisal (52), a Covid-19 patient. Jahan and her 19-year-old son stood for more than 10 hours at oxygen plants in Deva Road (Chinhat) and Sitapur Road but couldn’t get their hands on an oxygen cylinder. They returned broken and disappointed thinking they won’t be able to save Faisal but Hindvi came to their rescue and arranged a cylinder from the family of a Covid-19 patient who unfortunately could not be saved. Faisal was rushed to the hospital on borrowed oxygen. “Manish called me up for a cylinder and without any second thoughts I said ‘jaan bachni chahiye, le jaiye’. I ran from pillar to post to save my father, Abhay Kumar (62), but he succumbed to Covid-19 at a private hospital. I did not want another person to die because of delay in oxygen supply,” said Shitanshu Kumar of Keshavnagar, who lent the cylinder which Hindvi passed on to Ishrat. Hindvi too gave his cylinder to save the life of a friend’s wife. “I have three elderly persons at home who are not well. So, I had purchased a small oxygen cylinder for them in case of emergency. However, my friend’s wife desperately needed support so I gave my cylinder,” he added. The father of city resident, Omar Siddiqui, was also infected with Covid-19 and was on oxygen support. However, when his friend called him frantically for immediate oxygen help for the father of another friend, Siddiqui, gave him the cylinder which he had at his home. “His father had stabilised a bit so Omar lent the cylinder to another patient. Meanwhile, his father’s condition started deteriorating but we could not find an oxygen cylinder for him. The other patient who had the cylinder was also not stable enough to return it. Somehow, Omar’s father was admitted to ICU. His condition is still severe,” a common friend said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/humanity-triumphs-lending-o2-stock-to-save-lives/articleshow/82265293.cms||Mohita Tewari
---||Hyderabad||Painter killed after a tiff over land deal||Hyderabad: A 38-year-old painter was allegedly stabbed to death by his relatives during an argument over land deal commission at Jawaharnagar on Sunday night. The deceased was,identified as Rajan alias Chinna from Janmabhoomi Nagar in Jawaharnagar. Rajan and his brother Srujan had brokered a land deal between their relative, Madhubabu’s family and a local man, Mahesh Yadav. Madhu Babu is a railway employee from Neredmet. Madhubabu and his family paid part of the amount to Mahesh Yadav as part of sale agreement for the land at Balaji Nagar, Chennnapuram. They also gave Rs 8,000 as commission to Rajan and Srujan. However, later, Madhubabu found out that the land was in dispute and took back the money given to Mahesh Yadav. “After cancelling the land deal, Madhubabu and his family members had an argument with Rajan for taking the commission despite showing them a disputed land. On Sunday night, Madhubabu and his brother went to Janmabhoomi Nagar. Madhubabu called Rajan out of the house and they exchanged punches. Meanwhile, while relatives of Rajan were taking him back to the house forcibly, Madhubabu and his brother attacked him with a knife and killed him on the spot,” Jawaharnagar in-charge inspector Panduranga Reddy said. After the incident, the accused fled from the scene and police launched a manhunt to nab them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/painter-killed-after-a-tiff-over-land-deal/articleshow/82264418.cms||---

Vaccination could not be done at 38 centres throughout the day on Tuesday and in the first half in around 60 of the total 148 centres.In the remaining 50 Covid-19 Vaccination Centres (CVC), inoculation started at 9am. While Covishield was administered in 46, it was Covaxin in the other four, according to Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) data. “After we received 30,000 doses in the afternoon, vaccination began in 60 more centres. So, totally only 110 CVCs were functioning today,” NMC officials said.On Monday too, inoculation did not take place in 36 CVCs due to no Covishield stock, according to NMC data..Activist Narayan Ahuja said that many senior citizens thronged CVCs for their second doses on Tuesday “fearing rush from May 1”. “The NMC should have intimated via online or through social media about vaccination not starting in many centres. Hapless citizens had to visit centres and returned without jabs. Many had registered online for Tuesday but there were no doses when they reached the centres. Long queues were seen at some CVCs when doses arrived in the second half of the day,” he said.On April 24, TOI had reported that vaccination had taken a hit at many centres on April 22 and 23 due to shortage of Covishield doses. The NMC had received 30,000 doses on Friday which got used up up to Monday.As per data of deputy director of health services (DDHS), NMC was left with only 1,020 doses of Covaxin when vaccination started at the four centres on Tuesday. NMC data shows that 539 took the jab leaving the city left with doses enough only for Wednesday.Following shortage of Covaxin doses, the two centres at the government medical college and hospital (GMCH) were administering vaccine to beneficiaries who were coming for a second dose. The centres reportedly denied jabs to 45-plus age group coming for their first doses. NMC’s Mahal Diagnostic Centre and Dr Ambedkar Hospital have administered first doses on Tuesday.8,343 citizens took the vaccine on Tuesday of which a majority could get it only in the second half of the day.As per DDHS’ data, Chandrapur district could inoculate only 374 and 328 people on April 25 and 26, respectively, as against the daily average of 10,000 due to shortage of doses. Inoculation resumed at all centres on Tuesday and 14,408 took the jab.The government had announced vaccination for 18-plus people from May 1. But the 11 districts of Vidarbha are yet to get doses for the programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vax-at-98-centres-hit-due-to-no-stock/articleshow/82288228.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Police have formed two special teams to crack the case.Velusamy, supervisor of the Tasmac shop, told the RS Puram (crime) police that the amount, which was the collection on April 23 and 24, was kept in a steel locker in the shop as he couldn’t deposit the same in bank on Saturday, when it was a bank holiday. He said the shop had clocked more sale on Saturday, as the customers knew the shop won’t be opened on Sunday because of the total lockdown. An investigation officer said, “Velusamy had kept the two days’ collection of Rs 10,72,270 in the steel locker. When he returned to the shop at 10am on Monday, he found the shutter locks were broken open.”The Tasmac supervisor immediately informed the R S Puram police, who rushed to the spot along with forensic experts, who lifted a few fingerprints from the crime scene.

---||India||New fly ash utilisation rule for thermal power plants||NEW DELHI: Seeking to deal with environmentally hazardous fly ash generated from coal and lignite based thermal power plants (TPPs), the Centre has made it mandatory for such plants to ensure 100% utilisation of fly ash within three to five years. It also, for the first time, introduced fines on non-compliant plants under the ‘polluter pays principle’, taking into account utilisation targets from April 1 next year. Under the draft plan, notified by the environment ministry last week, non-compliant TPPs will have to pay a fine of Rs 1,000 per tonne on unutilised ash which is to be accounted at the end of every financial year based on annual reports. Though fly ash utilisation in India has increased from nearly 10% in 1996-97 to the highest level of over 83% during 2019-20, unutilised ash gets dumped in an environmentally hazardous manner, polluting air, water and soil. Existing provisions allow TPPs to fully utilise fly ash in a four-year cycle in a staggered manner. The new plan will, however, follow a three-year cycle for 100% utilisation of fly ash with a grace period of a year in the ‘first compliance’ cycle if the percentage of ash utilisation is between 60-80% and two years if it is below 60% as accounted during 2021-22. From the ‘second compliance’ cycle, all TPPs will have to stick to average ash utilisation of 100% in a three-year cycle. The ministry’s draft plan also deals with unutilised accumulated ash (legacy ash) where TPPs will have to utilise it within 10 years from the date of publication of final notification in a staggered manner. If the utilization of legacy ash is not completed at the end of 10 years, a fine of Rs 1000 per tonne will be imposed on the remaining unutilised quantity which has not been fined earlier. The collected fines will be deposited in the designated account of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). “The fine collected by CPCB from the TPPs and other defaulters shall be used towards the safe disposal of the unutilised ash,” said the draft notification. The draft enlists several eco-friendly ways to utilise fly ash so that it does not pollute air and water. It includes use of fly ash in manufacturing of bricks/tiles, cement, ready-mix concrete; constructing roads, dams and embankment, and filling of low-lying areas and mines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/new-fly-ash-utilisation-rule-for-thermal-power-plants/articleshow/82267046.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Discharged numbers a positive sign, says Tope||Mumbai: Health minister Rajesh Tope said cases in the state have been consistent and number of discharges are picking pace which is a positive sign. BMC officials said cases have steadily dropped in Mumbai—from 11,206 on April 4 to 9,989 on April 11 to 3,840 on April 26. Additional municipal commissioner Ashwini Bhide said cases and positivity rate have steadily declined though testing numbers have dipped as well; on Sunday, 28,328 tests were done as against 40,000 on an average. BMC executive health officer Mangala Gomare said despite the fewer tests, positivity rate in Mumbai on Monday was among the lowest this month of 13.6%. “Deaths may rise as these correspond to cases that tested positive during the peak roughly 15 days back,” she added. BMC chief I S Chahal listed out the “positive” developments for the city. For one, Mumbai still has 4,090 vacant beds in 172 Covid hospitals. “We have increased the number of beds from 12,000 to 22,000 in the last six weeks, adding 1,500 more beds at the Nesco field hospital, Goregaon, this week,” he said. Number of ICUs have also increased from 1,500 to almost 2,800. “In the second wave which started on February 10, total number of new cumulative cases have been 3 lakh and the cumulative deaths have been 1,319. Mortality rate for the second wave has been 0.4% and this is the lowest anywhere in the world,” he said. The Kalyan-Dombivli belt reported its lowest tally in 25 days at 854. But, nine deaths were reported, taking the toll to 1,335. Maharashtra has discharged 4.5 lakh people in last six days. On Monday too, daily discharg-es were higher than detections. A total 71,736 people were disch-arged taking total to 36 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-discharged-numbers-a-positive-sign-says-tope/articleshow/82265350.cms||Malathy Iyer

The deceased were identified as Murali, 16, son of Sundaravelmurugan, and Ajmal, 14, son of Latheef. Their friend Febin Firos, who had also sustained injuries, is under treatment at the hospital. The blast had taken place at an uninhabited house at Karakandi near Sulthan Bathery town on Thursday. The house, owned by Perinthalmanna native Radhakrishnan, had remained uninhabited for the last two years. The blast had taken place in a shed attached to the house. Sulthan Bathery police said that the explosion was suspected to be caused by gunpowder when the children who were wandering in the area went inside the building and lighted it. “The investigation is on to find out the source of the explosives,” a police official said.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/two-students-succumb-to-burns/articleshow/82263702.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Petitioner cites bias, seeks case transfer||Mumbai: One of the petitioners who sought to oppose the state economic offences wing’s (EOW) closure report in the alleged Rs 25,000-crore Maharashtra State Cooperative (MSC) Bank scam case, has submitted a plea before the principal judge of the sessions court seeking a transfer of the case from the court of the judge currently hearing the matter. Former MLA Manik Bhimrao Jadhav’s plea said he was more than convinced that the judge had developed a bias and was prejudiced against the protest petitioners. Jadhav’s plea came days after the incharge court refused to grant a time of four weeks to them to go through 75,000 pages of the closure report. The plea said the case not only entails voluminous documents but also complicated legal issues, involvement of high-ranking bureaucrats and politicians and issues of great public importance. “The applicant..has real apprehension and genuine fear that free and fair hearings would not be available to him before the judge,” the plea said. The plea submitted by advocate Satish B Talekar said that on April 20, the court also accepted documents that were submitted by a third party on behalf of the original complainant, activist Surinder Mohan Arora. The plea said that the documents were accepted despite strong objections made by Talekar, Arora’s lawyer. The lawyer had then submitted that Arora had complained about receiving threats and it was quite possible that the accused were trying to win him over. Additionally, a plea was also submitted on an alleged conversation where Arora purportedly made certain “startling admissions, which has a direct bearing on the happenings in the court on April 20.” The EOW’s documents were given to Jadhav and others in a pendrive. Jadhav’s plea seeking the transfer also said that he had requested Talekar to seek four weeks on the grounds that public transport facilities were restricted, and there were several other difficulties, including closure of shops for taking printouts. It also cited Arora’s recent battle with coronavirus and his prolonged treatment. “The applicant fails to understand as to how and why the judge is so hostile for granting additional time to the applicants for going through the papers which is not a mechanical exercise.... The 74,784 papers are not merely photographs or paintings,” the plea said. It also said that this was not such an urgent matter that needed to be heard on a day to day basis during a pandemic. The court has directed the prosecution to submit its reply. The plea will come up for hearing before the principal judge on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-petitioner-cites-bias-seeks-case-transfer/articleshow/82265354.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Many family members are not turning up to collect the remains of their relatives and as a result, the crematorium is running out of space. Several platforms could not be used as ashes lay unclaimed for days. The crematorium staff said that daily, five to six such cases are taking place. For the past one week, more than 60 cremations were conducted at Antim Niwas daily. Though immersion of ashes is considered an important ritual, some families somehow have been unable to visit the centre to collect them.A member of Lok Manch, the NGO that manages the facility on behalf of the Noida Authority, said, “Our staff has witnessed a lot of tragedies in the past fortnight. In some cases, the body was set afire by our volunteers as no male member was present. We have kept the unclaimed ashes in the same spot as of now.”A volunteer deputed at the cremation centre said, “We will keep the ashes for a few days. After a week or 10 days we will immerse them in the Yamuna. Earlier, we were preserving them in earthen pots. A lot of cremations are taking place and that is our priority now.”The preserved pots have been kept in the storeroom and the name of the deceased person has been mentioned to avoid confusion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/50-60-bodies-cremated-at-antim-niwas-but-no-one-to-claim-remains/articleshow/82265298.cms||Shalabh

---||Bhopal||Not time to apologise, but to act: BJP neta to CM||BHOPAL: In an embarrassment to the ruling BJP, former minister Anoop Mishra raised questions on the black-marketing of oxygen cylinders and Remdesivir injections in Madhya Pradesh and also advised chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to ensure proper supply of health facilities. “Shivraj Chouhanji, people are gasping for breath and the situation has turned very sad and painful. The black-marketing of Remdesivir and oxygen has put a question mark on the entire system. They are not in the reach of the common people but available with the brokers and some leaders,” said Mishra. The senior saffron party leader, who is also the nephew of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said that this is not a time to apologise or convince the people but to act. “This is not the time to try or apologise, but to pay attention to timely treatment of people at the grassroots level and to ensure the supply of Remedesvir and oxygen to the needy; lest in the midst of apology many priceless lives won’t live among us,” said Mishra. Recently, former minister and MLA from Patan in Jabalpur district, Ajay Vishnoi also advised the chief minister to act promptly amid Covid-19 crisis and make arrangements for oxygen cylinders from the animal husbandry department. They can get oxygen from Jindal plant in Raigad in Chhattisgarh. However, Vishnoi has cautioned about the functioning of oxygen plants. “The new oxygen plant in Jabalpur district hospital is able to provide oxygen to only 13 patients instead of 100. CM Shivraj Chouhanji please pay attention before the rest of the districts set up oxygen plants,” tweeted Vishnoi on Sunday. Mishra also suggested collecting feedback every four hours regarding the supply of essential requirements. “Through micro-planning at your level you can collect feedback every four hours from all over the state to ensure availability of Remdesivir, oxygen and bed. Then people can be saved from untimely death,” suggested Mishra. Sources in BJP disclosed that party leaders all over the state are concerned over delay in supply of oxygen and injections. The government has, however, assured that situation will be normal as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured setting up of oxygen plants in each district with the help of PM Cares fund. “Under Sewa Hi Sangathan drive-2, we have developed Covid care centers in various districts, provided meals to the Covid patients and their family members and ensured oxygen supply from BHEL and other plants. We have also launched a drive under Mera Booth Corona Mukt' (my booth Corona free) to encourage vaccination,” said BJP state media in-charge, Lokendra Parashar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/not-time-to-apologise-but-to-act-bjp-neta-to-cm/articleshow/82264427.cms||---
---||Lucknow||How critically ill Covid patients defeated virus||Lucknow: Despite high Covid-19 transmission and death rates, there is also no dearth of people who got critically ill and spent days in hospitals, but successfully defeated the virus. General physician Dr Wazahat (42), a resident of Rahimnagar, was admitted to Era’s Lucknow Medical College and Hospital with breathing issues with 80% blood oxygen levels earlier this month. Tests revealed that he was suffering from bilateral pneumonia caused by Covid-19. Chances of his survival were grim, but he fought bravely with the help of doctors and recovered. “His x-ray showed that the lungs were white, indicating severe infection. He was already asthmatic and diabetic. We decided to put him on the ventilator. Course of antibiotics and anticoagulants was done and his condition improved gradually. In three days, his ventilator support was taken off and fully recovered in a week,” said ELMCH principal Dr MM Faridi. “'Dua aur dost se jyada, ek accha doctor Covid se ladney ki shakti deta hai (More than prayers and friends, a good doctor gives strength to fight against Covid-19), said Prof Kaviraj (50), who teaches political science in Lucknow University, who was hospitalized for a week after contracting the infection. He was admitted to KGMU following breathlessness on April 10. The sight of people dying in front of him due to the disease left him in depression, but doctors kept motivating him that helped him generate will power to fight against the infection. “Four out of six patients in my ward died, but doctors told me daily not to bother because they were confident that I would survive and be discharged soon,” said the professor, who recovered after nine days of hospitalisation. Prof Poonam Tandon (52), head, department of physics and dean student welfare, Lucknow University, spent a total of 10 days in two hospitals before recovering. "For the first three days after being diagnosed with the disease, I was admitted at Era's Medical hospital and later when my fever and oxygen levels didn't improve, I was shifted to Dr Ram Manohar Lohia hospital," she said. “I was deeply shattered when my two colleagues Prof KC Pandey and Prof BK Shukla – admitted in the same ward -- died before me. I slipped into depression, but my daughter and husband kept motivating me all the while, keeping me mentally and psychologically strong,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/how-critically-ill-covid-patients-defeated-virus/articleshow/82265328.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Pune||In April, Pune airport records higher departures as compared to arrivals||PUNE: The number of passengers departing from Pune airport has increased in April compared to incoming passengers. The total flight movements at the facility, which had increased to around 100 (50 departures and 50 arrivals) with the start of the summer schedule on March 30, has now dropped to around 74. Even though the Indian Air Force postponed its proposed closure of the runaway at the airport — earlier scheduled from Monday till May 9 — it failed to have any impact as airlines had stopped bookings for the period, airport officials told TOI. “Total number of flights from Pune has gone down mainly due to poor passenger traffic. Not many people have been travelling and the number of departures during the current period is far more than the arrivals. Unless and until the current scenario improves, we don’t expect the flight movements to increase considerably,” a senior airport official said. A glance at March and April figures reveal that on most days, the number of those departing from the airport has been more than those arriving. “However, in April, the number of daily departures on most days has been almost double the number of arrivals,” the official added. Middle-aged Pankaj Chaudhary, who has a flat in Dhanori area in Pune, left for his hometown in Ranchi last week. “My family back home and my wife here were scared due to the rising Covid-19 cases. Since I have been working from home, we took a decision to leave Pune. While cases in Ranchi, too, are high, at least we have family and friends who can help us,” he said. Similar is the case of Mandira Das, who has decided to leave for her home in West Bengal. “I am trying to understand the regulations. My parents are worried and want me to return home. I will leave before restrictions get even stricter,” Das, who lives in Balewadi, said. The passenger traffic at the airport, which until January and February had shown signs of revival, has taken a hit amidst rising Covid-19 cases. “There has been a 15% drop in March compared to January. April is turning out to be worse,” another airport official said. “From our experience last year, we know that the number of passengers departing Pune is directly proportional to the rate of infection. The current crisis has made outstation professionals, workers, students and others in Pune feel insecure,” aviation analyst and expert Dhairyashil Vandekar said. On Monday, there were just 20 flight movements (10 arrivals and 10 departures). “This happened as the runway was scheduled to be shut down from Monday. However, the plan has been deferred. Airlines had not done any bookings but after the closure was cancelled, they were not able to sell seats / plan flights for this period,” a senior airport official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-airport-records-more-departures-compared-to-arrivals-in-april/articleshow/82264445.cms||Joy Sengupta

However, no casualties were reported. Officials suspect a gas leak from a tiffin center in the complex around 8.15 am might have caused the fire and later spread to the footwear shop. Locals, who noticed the fire and thick smoke from the closed footwear shop on the ground floor of the complex, immediately alerted the fire department and the police. Although no casualties were reported, the massive fire and smoke led to a panic like situation in sthe area which is surrounded by residential colonies. “It is an eight-floor building, and the footwear shop was full of rubber and inflammable material. The loss would have been massive if the locals wouldn’t have responded quickly. We received a call around 8.30 am and immediately rushed fire tenders to the location. It took us about an hour to bring the situation under control. There was nobody present inside at the time of the mishap,” said station house officer of Secunderabad, Mohan Rao, Fire personnel with the help of two fire engines doused the fire. Officials further informed that the police have launched an investigation and the cost of the property damaged in the mishap is yet to be estimated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fire-accident-in-footwear-shop-in-bansilalpet-no-casualties/articleshow/82264450.cms||---

Have those who insulted the Guru and shot at the peaceful protesters been punished?” said Mann. He said the 10th challan of former IG Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh’s SIT could have bigger names and those should not think of getting clean chit,” he added.Mann said Capt Amarinder Singh had failed miserably in getting justice in the sacrilege and police firing cases, while he had taken an oath holding Sri Gutka Sahib in his hands that upon formation of the government, the culprits of sacrilege and firing cases will be put behind the bars. Mann said it was a ‘double sacrilege’ and both SAD and Congress will have to pay a heavy price for this heinous crime and betrayal, in the upcoming assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-getting-cong-support-in-sacrilege-police-firing-cases-mann/articleshow/82265918.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Delayed RT-PCR reports triggering Covid surge, high transmission rate in Lucknow||LUCKNOW: Satvik Pandey of Aliganj and his family members gave their samples for RT-PCR test but when they did not receive their report, they decided to go for a CT scan. “The CT scan showed my mother had initial stage of Covid pneumonia after which we started medication. However, residents of my colony who had influenza-like symptoms continued to visit grocery shops and vegetable markets. When we told them that they should be in home isolation, they said their test results are awaited and they are not sure whether they have Covid or not,” Satvik said. Experts agree that delay in Covid-19 test results might be contributing to high transmission rate being witnessed this month. The three government-supported pathology labs in the city are taking 3-7 days in giving reports. Many private labs are also taking at least 48 hours to give reports due to limited resources. Some of them are not taking more samples than their daily capacity. The three government-supported labs at KGMU, SGPGIMS and RMLIMS together conduct over 25,000 RT-PCR tests per day but since the number of samples collected daily are over 30,000, there is a huge backlog which causes delay. The number of private labs authorised to conduct Covid tests have been increased from 17 to 24 over the week. These labs conduct over 5,000 tests daily. “Over 5,000 cases per day have been reported in the last two weeks. Since an infected person can pass on the virus to at least five people, more cases daily mean five times more people require tests every day. If we are not able to test so many people daily, it creates a backlog and delays results, which in turn provides time to infected asymptomatic persons to spread the infection. We are increasing the capacity of government labs and authorising more private labs. Since the volume of cases is high, facilities are taking time to catch up,” a senior health official said. A microbiologist at RMLIMS, Dr Manodeep Sen, said: “It has been seen that many of those who get infected and are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, despite being advised to stay in home isolation, take the matter casually till the time their report confirms infection. Delay of 3-5 days in test results makes such people superspreaders.” Sarvendra Chauhan (32), a resident of Rae Bareli Road, gave his samples on April 19 but the report was awaited till Monday evening. “I have started Covid medication but don’t know what exactly my ailment is. In case my condition deteriorates, no hospital will admit me without an RT-PCR test report,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/delayed-rt-pcr-reports-triggering-covid-surge-high-transmission-rate/articleshow/82265365.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

It was only after the police intervened that the residents agreed to allow the hospital staff as well as patients’ relatives to use the lift. However, the residents have pledged to raise an objection with the civic body about granting permission for setting up Covid-19 hospital in a residential apartment. They claimed that if they do not get relief from the civic body and district collector, they would even move the high court and seek justice. When the Pundaliknagar’s assistant inspector Ghanshyam Sonawne heard about the development, he rushed to the spot and convinced the residents to allow the hospital to utilize the lift. The residents expressed serious concerns about the possibility of their family members, especially the elderly and children, getting infected. He told TOI, “The residents have objections regarding the patients’ relatives gathering in the parking space, use of lift by Covid-19 patients and relatives. The residents fear they may get infected.” The officer said that 14 Covid-19 patients are being treated at the facility. When contacted, AMC health officer Dr Neeta Padalkar said, “Once we receive the written objection, we will carry out spot inspection, following which, appropriate decision will be taken.” Builder Babulal Magar, who constructed the apartment, said the residents have objection to the use of lift by the hospital. “They also have some other objections. I took an undertaking from the hospital management that they will be responsible, if lift faces any issue,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/cops-step-in-as-residents-block-lift-to-covid-facility/articleshow/82264452.cms||Mohammed Akhef

However, the earnings are not good and there are very few passengers. The new rule of maximum two passengers per taxi has also led to the dip in commuters. And, those caught with four passengers (family members) are imposed with hefty fines,” he said. He added that due to several curbs by state and private offices and non-essential shops shut, these cabbies are missing their regular office passengers. “Nearly 60% earnings were from these passengers and now cabbies have to wait for hours for a passenger,” he said.  — Somit Sen||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-75-cab-drivers-leave-city-fearing-further-lockdown/articleshow/82265397.cms||Somit Sen

The elder sister on April 25 lodged an FIR alleging that the police sub-inspector (PSI), who is a friend of their relative, was consuming liquor with him in the latter’s flat. At this point, the PSI called the girl and her sister and touched them inappropriately, the FIR stated. Additional commissioner of police (crime) Ashok Morale told TOI “A case of molestation was registered against the sub-inspector after the young woman approached the police. We have initiated an inquiry against the PSI and the assistant commissioner of police (Khadki division) is conducting it.

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Fasting Muslim men perform last rites of Hindu Covid victims||LUCKNOW: They don’t know the dead nor does their religion matter to them. A group of young Muslim men has been performing the last rites of patients, both Hindus and Muslims, dying of Covid-19. The men are fasting during ongoing Ramzan, but are continuing the selfless service despite the discomfort of PPE kit and fear of getting infected with virus while handling bodies. Imdad Imam (33), a store owner and graphic designer from Maqbara Golganj area in the Old City, and his team of 22 men have till now helped cremate seven Hindus and bury 30 Muslim Covid victims. “Most either did not have a family, or their kin were not in town. In few cases, the family members were themselves ill, while in one case we were informed of a body by neighbours,” said Imam, who started ensuring dignified last rites with his Covid-19 Tadfeen (burial) Committee last year. “On April 21, we got a call from Bharat Nagar on Sitapur road that a woman who lived alone and had Covid had died and the body was lying for three days. The tenants who lived on the floor above, said they had not seen her, neither heard any voice for three days and there was a stench,” he said. “There was no family member. So, with the help of a neighbour, we packed the body in a body suit and took it to Baikunth Dham and handed it over to Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) employees for cremation,” he added. On Friday, the team cremated two Hindu women. “One woman lived on Kabir Marg near Yojana Bhawan. She died at home while her son is in Bangalore. The other woman was from Manas Nagar and no relatives or friends had turned up,” said Imam, who has been living in isolation at his home as precaution. The men from Sarfarazganj, Wazirganj, Napier road and Kashmiri Mohalla, are between 30 to 35 years, and the active ones are Mehdi Raza, Kazim Abbas, Ashir Agha, Ahsan Nazir and Meraj Husain. The team has only been taking PPE kits and sanitisers in donation, not any financial help, but faces difficulty in getting body covers. “Sometimes, it becomes difficult because there is no ventilation in PPE kits and we start feeling suffocation. One of us collapsed today, but got up to continue work,” said Imam when asked whether the work was difficult during Ramzan. Since rituals are not performed in Covid deaths, they just sprinkled the Ganga Jal given to them by kin or neighbours. “We don’t know about the Hindu rituals of immersing ashes, so we ask LMC workers to help,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/fasting-muslim-men-perform-last-rites-of-hindu-covid-victims/articleshow/82265387.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Surat||Hospitals turn away new patients due to O2 paucity||Surat: On Monday, government hospitals in city were unable to admit new patients due to lack of beds and oxygen. Since morning a queue of ambulances was lined up outside the Surat Municipal Institute of Medical Education and Research (SMIMER). The main gate of the New Civil Hospital (NCH) on Ring Road too was closed for patients and their relatives. The scene was much or less same at the Government Medical College (GMC), where patient’s entry was allowed from only one gate. Since early hours on Monday those bringing patients were not allowed to enter from the main gate of NCH by the bouncers. They were asked to go back and no satisfactory reason was given for refusing the admission. Despite multiple attempts Dr Ragini Verma, superintendent of NCH, was not available for her comments. Sources in NCH informed that they discontinued admitting new patients from Monday due to shortage of oxygen supply and beds. Only a few patients, brought by 108 ambulance, were admitted to the hospital. Similarly, at SMIMER hospital a number of patients were denied admission. SMIMER stopped taking patients being referred from private hospitals or coming from out of the city limit. “At SMIMER we have stopped taking patients brought from out of the city since a lot of patients are coming here from other places,” said Dr Ashish Naik, deputy commissioner (Health), SMIMER hospital. Sources in SMC informed that senior government officials held a meeting and rationing of oxygen is planned at the government hospitals. Mahadev Rathod, 30, a resident of Adajan, came in an ambulance and he was denied entry at SMIMER. He first went to a private hospital, then to an isolation centre in Althan and ultimately came to SMIMER. “I don’t know what will happen now,” a relative of Rathod told TOI. Another patient, Rekha Tayde, 45, was brought to SMIMER from K P Sanghvi Hospital but she was not allowed entry into the hospital campus. “My mother was shifted to the trust-run hospital two days ago from SMIMER claiming that her condition is improving. Due to increasing health complications she needed a ventilator for which she was again referred to SMIMER,” said her son Sumit. He was trying to contact the doctor who was treating Tayde at SMIMER to get her admitted while the patient was waiting in an ambulance. Similar was the situation at the majority of the private hospitals who have limited oxygen supply. The hospitals have stopped taking critical patients since they require ventilator support and it consumes a lot of oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/hospitals-turn-away-new-patients-due-to-o2-paucity/articleshow/82264468.cms||---
---||Kolkata||On-campus booth makes voting a breeze for South City residents||Kolkata: On a day many in the city avoided stepping out of their homes to go to polling booths, fearing they might contract the novel coronavirus in the crowd, those living at South City Residency breezed in and out of their designated booth, showing the marks on their fingers. The reason: they could vote within their gated residential complex. This was perhaps the only housing complex in the city that had a booth on the premises. The polling unit inside South City International School was a matter of routine, but never in the past did the residents thank their luck. “What more could we have asked for in this Covid situation? I was the first one to vote at 7am. This time, we realised how lucky we are,” said M V Biju, a resident. “My wife is diabetic and so, we were extra careful. We could vote this time only because the booth was inside the complex,” said cricketer Ashok Malhotra. The complex has 1,500 voters, many of whom were seen coming down from their towers right in the morning, all masked up. Ten voters, aged above 80, took the help of an Election Commission drive and requested for the provision of voting in their flats. Arrangements were made for them before the poll date. Among the remaining, about 50% residents voted on Monday. Rotary Club of South City also arranged for battery-operated carts to ferry senior citizens. The free service was a phone call away. “Seniors had to indicate the time they would be at the reception area and the car was ready for them. We didn’t want them to walk in the heat,” said Manoj Gupta, president of the residents’ association. Most residents were happy there was no queue and that the polling personnel followed all Covid safety protocol. “The general view was that here, you were with people you knew. In other booths, you never knew whether others had been following Covid safety rules or not,” said a resident. “Still, we had about 50% people voting. Many seniors did not want to take a chance. Then, there were some who were Covid-positive or under quarantine,” Gupta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/on-campus-booth-makes-voting-a-breeze-for-south-city-residents/articleshow/82264472.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Mumbai||Kin blame snag in Thane hosp’s O2 supply for four deaths, probe on||Thane: The Thane district collector has instituted a probe after relatives of four Covid patients, who died in a span of four hours early on Monday at the Vedant hospital, alleged their deaths were caused by a snag in the hospital’s oxygen supply network. The inquiry will ascertain if there was any medical negligence and will be done by a six-member panel. Thane guardian minister Eknath Shinde said CM Uddhav Thackeray has asked for fast-tracking of the probe. According to civic officials, the four patients were admitted to the hospital over the last few days along with 56 others requiring oxygen support. However, their kin who assembled near the hospital premises on Monday morning alleged the hospital had fallen short of oxygen and failed to arrange new supplies, which cost the patients their lives. “Our patient was stable till late Sunday night but I was shocked to know of the death. We got to know from some staffers that there was some snag in the oxygen supply system,” said Mandar Pashte, a relative. Another relative claimed his father was okay till midnight but he suddenly received a call in the early hours saying he had died. “There seems to be something suspicious in the facility, and we would not want anyone else to suffer,” he told TOI, refusing to be identified. Eknath Shinde visited the hospital late afternoon and said the chief minister had taken cognisance of the incident. The Vedant hospital management was unavailable for comment. Sources said the probe report may be submitted on Tuesday. No police case has been registered. Sandeep Pachange, an office-bearer of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena who visited the hospital after being alerted by one of the affected relatives, said that the municipal and hospital administration had played a “cruel joke” on hapless patients. BJP MLC Niranjan Davkhare alleged that the authorities were callous and had failed to take corrective action despite being reminded about such things in advance. BJP leader Kirit Somaiya called for the immediate sacking of state health minister Rajesh Tope citing several incidents of lapses leading to fatalities among Covid patients across the state in the past few days. The Maha Vikas Aghadi’s cabinet minister Jitendra Awhad also visited the hospital late on Monday afternoon. Shinde told mediapersons, “The Bhiwandi municipal commissioner, deputy collector of Thane, medical health officer, deputy municipal commissioner and the civil surgeon will probe the allegations. The probe will ascertain the cause of deaths and whoever is found guilty of negligence will not be spared.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/kin-blame-snag-in-thane-hosps-o2-supply-for-four-deaths-probe-on/articleshow/82265921.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||Mumbai||NIA seizes 2 cars in Mumbai that it says inspector Mane used in Hiran murder plot||Mumbai: The National Investigation Agency, probing the planting of gelatin sticks in an SUV parked near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s home and the subsequent murder of the vehicle owner Mansukh Hiran, seized two cars allegedly used by arrested police inspector Sunil Mane in the crime. On Sunday, NIA recovered Mane’s red Hyundai Creta from Borivli, and a white Volkswagen Polo from Andheri. Both have fake registration number plates. The Polo, registered in the name of Yash Shah, is believed to have been used in Hiran’s murder. NIA also claimed to have found CCTV footage outside Kalwa railway station where arrested API Sachin Waze is seen buying a set of handkerchiefs from a hawker. Handkerchiefs were stuffed in Hiran’s mouth when his body was found in Mumbra creek on March 5. NIA has recorded the statement of the hawker. The NIA has still not been able to understand the reason behind using five handkerchiefs and a face mask over Hiran’s face. Mane was arrested on April 23 and remanded in police custody till April 28. Mane is the fifth person and fourth policemen to be arrested in the case so far. The NIA carried out a search of the crime branch Kandivli unit where he was senior inspector and also his private security agency office in Andheri and seized documents. The NIA has sent the two seized vehicles for forensic analysis to find DNA and the presence of chloroform. Officials suspect that chloroform was used to render Hiran unconscious before he was killed. Mane, during interrogations, admitted that on March 4 night, he, along with Waze, called up Hiran posing as ‘inspector Tawde’ of the Kandivli crime branch unit and asked him to come to Ghodbunder Road in Thane. Mane said he took Hiran in the car to Hotel Hill View on Ghodbunder Road and handed him over to Waze and other policemen present there. They then smothered Hiran in the moving car and dumped his body in Thane creek, Mane claimed. On March 4, Waze created an alibi by keeping his mobile phone switched on in the Crime Intelligence Unit office at the police headquarters and then took a train from CSMT to reach Kalwa. At Kalwa, he was picked up by someone and they went to the Gaimukh area where Mane was waiting for him. Initially, it was believed that Waze had got off at Thane. Hiran’s diatom report from the government medical college had found water in his body. A diatom test throws light on if a person died due to drowning or was tossed into the water after being killed. To reconfirm this report, the ATS had then sent the diatom report to FSL Madhuban in Haryana whose report is awaited. Sources said that all the three arrested cops—Waze, API Riyazuddin Kazi and Mane—have revealed the same sequence of events and have blamed a former high-profile cop who is likely to be summoned again this week. NIA sources claimed to have procured enough material, digital and circumstantial evidence to support its case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/nia-seizes-2-cars-in-mumbai-that-it-says-inspector-mane-used-in-hiran-murder-plot/articleshow/82265957.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Hyderabad||High court notice to CBI in Rs 1,200 crore loan fraud case||Hyderabad: Justice K Lakshman of the Telangana high court on Monday issued a notice to the CBI asking it to explain the role of director Arjun Singh Oberoi of Hotel Trident in the alleged swindling of Rs 1,285 crore public money in the form of loans from a consortium of banks. Oberoi, who was made an accused in the CBI case, is apprehending arrest in the case any time.  The hotel was set up on a 4.5-acre government land, which was leased out to Golden Jubilee Hotels Private Ltd. The GJHPL consists of Core Hotel Ventures Private Limited with an 84 per cent stake and EIH Limited, the flagship company of The Oberoi Group, with a 16 per cent stake. While the petitioner’s counsel argued that it was he who first reported about the irregularities in the star hotel project, the CBI counsel said he would ascertain the role of the petitioner in the scam from the investigation officer. The judge had asked him to file his counter within two days and posted the case to Wednesday for further hearing. Bank of Baroda, the complainant and the lead bank, too was asked to file its counter. The judge said he would look into other prayers that sought protection from arrest only after hearing the version of the CBI. The petition filed by another director of the hotel Lakshmi Narayan Sharma, who was also made an accused, was adjourned to June 2. Interestingly, his counsel too claimed that it was Sharma who fought against the diversion of money from the project. Though both directors approached the high court seeking protection, their advocates urged the court not to club their cases and sought separate hearings in the cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/high-court-notice-to-cbi-in-rs-1200-crore-loan-fraud-case/articleshow/82264461.cms||---

The suspect was on the run after hacking the cook Gorakh Gund (40) in his sleep in the wee hours of April 8.

He had a heated argument with the cook over some issue,” Ghanwat said. Ghanwat added, “In the early hours of April 8, when everyone in the eatery was asleep, the suspect severely assaulted Gund with a sharp weapon and fled. The victim succumbed to the injuries during the treatment.” The inspector said that the police did not have any clues about the suspect apart from knowing his name. He was not using a cellphone. “We checked all the places where the suspect worked previously and gathered the information about his native place and relatives. We got a tip-off that the minor was in Otur to try and escape to his native place. We laid a trap at the bus stop and took him into the custody,” Ghanwat added.

The temple witnesses hundreds of thousands of devotees from across Maharashtra and Karnataka on the occasion of Chaitra Yatra. However, this time around, the abhishek of Lord Jotiba and his procession in palanquin was held in the presence of very few people. Not even the locals residing on the hill were allowed to attend the procession. Heavy police presence was deployed along the procession route and around the temple. The police teams were led by deputy superintendent of police RR Patil. A day before, the RT-PCR test report of 21 ‘Mankari’ — people who are chosen to be present for the abhishek and procession — arrived and five people tested positive. Local authorities also claimed that several residents of the temple area too have tested positive for Covid-19. District collector Daulat Desai, who is also the administrator of Paschim Maharashtra Devasthan Samiti (PMDS) that manages the regular affairs at Jotiba temple, had declared that the rituals will be carried out in simplest way possible by adhering to the Covid rules.

In a reality check, TOI visited medical stores in Niralanagar, Aliganj, Nishatganj, Daliganj and Aminabad to find out about the availability of medicines. Of the eight shops visited, none had oximeters while nasal pipes were available in all units. In Niralanagar, stocks of some essential medicines like medrol and Vitamin C tablets had exhausted on Thursday. “People are purchasing medicines out of the fear that they will not be available later.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Pushed to the limit, crematoria staring at acute wood shortage||NEW DELHI: With an unprecedented number of cremations taking place during the current wave of Covid-19, Delhi’s cremation ground operators are now staring at a shortage of wood. Each funeral pyre requires about 3-4 quintals of wood. A senior civic official said that Delhi’s cremation grounds were likely to face wood shortage as the reserves were getting exhausted fast because of the increasing number of Covid-protocol funerals. Nigambodh Ghat alone carried out 2,526 cremations between April 1 and 23, out of which 2,099 were wood-based. Over 8,000 quintals of wood were used in these cremations. “The states from which we used to procure wood are themselves struggling to manage the increased demand,” the official said. A manager from an NGO running a crematorium said that most of the wood in the capital comes from the Gadhganga-Hasanpur belt in UP. “As the demand is high in UP also, contractors have refused to take new orders. Haryana Forest Development Corporation has agreed to send us 7,000 quintals of wood. They will be paid Rs 450 per quintal. But they will not be sending us more wood. We are in touch with Uttarakhand also,” another civic official said. A funeral manager at the Karol Bagh crematorium stated that some contractors were now selling wood for rates as high as Rs 750 per quintal. “We get wood from Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. Till one month ago, wood was supplied at just Rs 400-500 per quintal,” he said. An official in the south corporation also said that some of the supplying states like UP and MP were witnessing rise in internal consumption and hence, were not willing to send additional wood to us. “If the same situation continues, wood for cremations will also start being sold in the black market,” he added. Meanwhile, East Delhi Municipal Corporation has issued orders to use cow dung cakes to reduce wood consumption. EDMC mayor Nirmal Jain said: “Though we are arranging more wood, use of cow dung cakes at Ghazipur and Seemapuri sites has been ordered. We faced a wood crisis on Saturday but things are now under control.” North corporation mayor Jai Prakash said that the civic body was in touch with some neighbouring states to secure wood. A report revealed that while the Paschim Vihar facility was getting wood on a day-to-day basis, cremation grounds at Inderpuri and Narela were also short on stock. Jitender Singh Shunty, incharge of the cremation ground in Seemapuri, said that they were using over 300 quintals of wood daily for cremations. “We have 40-50 tonnes of wood left. While the rates have increased in the market by Rs 100, we continue to provide wood at old rates,” he added. A total of 3,472 Covid-protocol funerals took place in the city last week. The huge demand for wood can be gauged from the consumption patterns in Nigambodh and Punjabi Bagh—city’s two biggest crematoria— where more than 17,000 quintals of wood have been used in the last three weeks.

This decision was taken during a cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Amarinder Singh here at Punjab Bhawan on Monday evening. The state government has allotted a budget of Rs 100 crore to the school education department for the scheme for the financial year 2021-22. As many as 1,75,443 regular students (boys & girls) studying in Class XII of government schools were given mobile phones last year. According to a spokesperson of the chief minister’s office, realising the benefit of imparting online education remotely to the students through the smart phones, particularly in the adverse pandemic situation last year, it has now been decided to extend the scheme to the students to be admitted in Class XII for the academic year 2021-22. The procurement shall be carried out through Punjab Infotech, under the state industries & commerce department. The mobile phones to be distributed under the scheme shall have various smart features such as touch screen, camera and pre-loaded government applications such as e-Sewa App with e-content related to Class 12 as approved by the school education department. Post facto approval to PPSC regulation changes To further speed up the process to fill nearly one lakh vacancies in various departments, boards, corporations, agencies of the state government, the cabinet gave post facto approval to amend Part-II B of the Punjab Public Service Commission (Limitation of Functions) Regulation, 1955, by putting these posts into the commission’s purview. PPSC had brought into the notice of the state government that different departments have sent their requisitions to it for direct recruitment of those vacancies that were earlier covered under Class III rules and which have been notified. Although, as per new grouping of 5th Pay Commission, these posts have fallen in Group-B Rules but the departments have not yet notified their Group-B rules. As per the Punjab Public Service Commission (Limitation of Functions) Regulations, 1955, only Group A and B recruitment can be done by the commission. However, due to the applicability of new central pay scales on new recruitments, old grouping became irrelevant. Due to this, such requisitions are being sent back by the commission to the concerned departments. Therefore, the commission has requested for giving some common guidance in this regard, so that the delay occurring in the recruitment process due to returning of requisitions may be reduced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/smartphones-for-2-15-lakh-students-soon-decides-cabinet/articleshow/82265925.cms||---

The threat of action is against such entities. Those hospitals with genuine problems should approach the district magistrate or chief medical officer to resolve their problem,” he said. On Monday, Tata and Reliance offered to augment the oxygen supply in UP and their proposals are being worked out.  Sehgal said, arrangements were being made to procure more oxygen and guidelines for an oxygen audit had been issued. Under this, all government and private hospitals and those converted into Covid care units would have to provide oxygen data to the government. “A watch is being kept on oxygen availability in all hospitals across districts. With this data, we will ensure there is sufficient supply in UP,” Sehgal said. The government is also trying to raise the number of oxygen tankers in the state. The ones already available are being installed with GPS to track their movement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hospitals-making-false-oxygen-shortage-claims-will-face-action-up/articleshow/82267050.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Dr Amar Kanabar (39), who works at Satkar Covid-19 Hospital located behind the central bus depot, lodged a complaint against Divyarajsinh Zala and his two accomplices. "Zala and two others came to inquire about the Covid-19 bed for their relatives. When the receptionist told them that there was none available, they entered into an altercation with the staff. As doctors heard the ruckus, they came to reception to speak with Zala. But he started arguing with Dr Kanabar who told them they neither had beds nor oxygen,” the complaint stated.Angered at this response, Zala started thrashing Dr Kanabar. When other staff members - Tejas Goswami, Jaydeep Dodiya and Sunny Singh - intereved, Zala and two others beat them up also. “They also threatened staff members to stop the hospital’s operations,” police said.

---||Pune||SPPU may hold second sem final-yr exams in June||Pune: Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) plans to hold online examinations for the second semester for final year students in the third week of June so that their results and other processes can be completed by August 15. The final-year students will be given priority so that they do not suffer while applying for further courses, or jobs or higher education abroad, university officials said. Mahesh Kakade, director of examination and evaluation at SPPU, said, “Almost all the final-year examination processes will end by May 10. This time, since we do not have the practical marks, we are only announcing the subjectwise marks of theory papers online. Students can make a fair assumption after getting the marks on whether they will be needed to appear for the backlog exams or not. Accordingly, we are also modifying our systems and software,” Kakade said. SPPU plans to open the exam-form filling process as soon as the subject marks are announced. “We appeal to final- year students to fill up their examination forms online within the given time-frame n. We may not be able to give too many extensions this time as we need the exam form data and then the hall ticket generation data to find out how many students are appearing for the examinations,” Kakade said. Many colleges had already started their second-semester lessons by January-February and university officials feel that they will be able to complete the syllabus. “If all the pre-examination processes like exam form-filling end by June 15, we will be able to start the second-semester examinations by the third week of June. While final-year students and their subjects will be given priority, we will also try to start exams for all pre-final year students at the same time. If we are able to complete the examinations, including practicals by July 15 or the end of July, we would need about 15 days to process the results, and we aim to finish the whole process by August 15,” Kakade said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sppu-may-hold-second-sem-final-yr-exams-in-june/articleshow/82264510.cms||Ardhra Nair

At present, there is one incinerator in the city operated by the facility and has a capacity of 200 kg/hour. All waste from private hospitals and government hospitals is being collected and treated by BWTF, provided by Alliance Envirocare Company Private Limited, in Industrial Area, Phase I. Debendra Dalai, member secretary, Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC), said as the second wave of Covid-19 has upended life, the CPCC had written a letter to Haryana authorities seeking their help, if any problem occurs during biomedical waste management. Like last year, the Haryana authorities have agreed to help the administration, if any such situation arises. Though the UT administration is fully prepared, they don’t want to take chances and have made advance arrangement, he added. Last year, the administration in its report submitted to the government had stated, “Keeping in view the condition arisen due to the pandemic, Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee has requested the neighbouring states, Haryana State Pollution Control Board and Punjab Pollution Control Board to facilitate the Biomedical Waste Treatment and Disposal Facility of Chandigarh as an alternate/standby arrangements for the final disposal of Chandigarh’s biomedical waste during any emergency, breakdown/maintenance of incinerator plant. Haryana State Pollution Control Board has agreed upon it in principle”. The NGT had observed that dumping Covid-19 waste in general bins or sewage without safeguards is hazardous. It recommended using best practices and new ideas under supervision, besides compiling data from tracking Covid-19 waste from all sources, to prevent accidental spill, aid strategic planning, and improve software. The order said to educate waste handlers, staff, and citizens about the precautions they must take, and demanded a local model plan. The green court told Central Pollution Control Board to coordinate with the media and central/state departments for the purpose. 3 hospitals top contributors In a report submitted to the government last year, the UT administration had submitted that biomedical waste came from top three medical institutes, PGI, Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, Government Multi-specialty Hospital, Sector 16, and other civil hospitals, quarantine centres and municipal corporation||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/will-help-dispose-covid-waste-during-emergency-hry/articleshow/82263209.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The people’s representatives present in the meeting expressed concern over black marketing of essential drugs and oxygen. Recently, city police registered a case against three people, including a health staffer for being part of the racket illegally selling Remdesivir. The meeting was attended by Rajya Sabha MP Bhagwat Karad, MLC Ambadas Danve, state minister Sandeepan Bhumre among other MLAs. During the meeting Bhumre also issued directives for deploying sufficient manpower at dedicated Covid hospital in Paithan. Unlike previous weeks, Aurangabad Member of Parliament Imtiaz Jaleel came down heavily after authorities failed to answer questions raised by him. Following the meeting, Jaleel said, “Last year the state government had announced all Covid-19 patients will be covered and treated under Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Aroyga Scheme. When I asked the authorities about the implementation of the scheme as well as number of beneficiaries, none of them had any answer.” He added that he had also asked the same questions to revenue divisional commissioner Sunil Kendrekar, but he too failed to answer. Blaming the state and the administration for failing to pay heed to the sufferings of the poor and the commoners, Jaleel pointed though the state has announced that Covid patients will be treated under MJPJAY, a notification has been issued stating that a patient will be able to avail the benefit of the scheme only if he stays on ventilator for 14 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/administration-failing-to-answer-questions-jaleel/articleshow/82264494.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Small hospitals can now treat those in need of oxygen||VADODARA: Senior IAS officer Dr Vinod Rao, in-charge of Covid-19 in central Gujarat, was forced to put on hold his notification denying oxygen to 164 Covid-designated ‘small’ hospitals within 24 hours of issuing it. Thousands of patients remained on the edge after the notification on Sunday night declaring that 164 smaller hospitals will not be given oxygen any more and they should stop admitting patients needing oxygen. The notification was eventually put on hold in wake of the tremendous political pressure. The notification had grouped private hospitals in different categories based on their capacity and need for oxygen. It was decided that smaller hospitals with low capacity will not be allowed to admit patients needing oxygen. They were to be given oxygen for existing patients as well as for emergency needs. The notification barred oxygen therapy for home-based Covid care. Refilling and trading of oxygen to institutions other than the hospitals identified for oxygen therapy was also disallowed. The decision sparked a row with the opposition Congress as well as BJP members too taking it on. Congress members took up the issue with the district collector and Rao. Heavyweight BJP MLA from Savli, Ketan Inamdar, dashed off a letter to chief minister Vijay Rupani expressing anger over the move. A meeting of elected representatives of the city, officials including Rao and representatives of the affected hospitals was called on Monday afternoon to discuss the issue. It was chaired by minister of state for Narmada and urban housing Yogesh Patel. After deliberations, it was decided that the notification would be put on hold. Patel said that if the patients who were being treated on oxygen in small hospitals came to larger or government hospitals, the staff there that was already burdened would get stretched further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/u-turn-small-hospitalscan-treat-those-on-o2-now/articleshow/82264516.cms||---

Don’t skip 2nd after cure||Lucknow: If you have received the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine but got infected with the novel coronavirus, there is no need to worry about the status of your vaccination as you can go for the second dose soon after recovery. According to medical experts, the prescribed number of vaccine doses should be taken and no one should skip it without expert advice. “If someone contracts infection after the first vaccine shot, the person should wait till recovery and get the second dose after it,” said head of SGPGI’s microbiology department Prof Ujjala Ghoshal. “The infection will leave a person with some antibodies but it is still not known for how long natural immunity lasts. The full dose of vaccine will provide better antibodies against the disease and its severity,” she said. Prof Ghoshal said it was imperative to take the same vaccine (Covaxin or Covishield) for both the doses and mixing of the two should not be done. “The gap between the two doses is to be 8-12 weeks but if one is recovering from an illness, or has missed the appointment for second dose, one should not panic and take the second shot at the earliest,” said Prof Ghoshal. “According to the World Health Organization (WHO), even if a person had Covid-19 in the past, he or she should be vaccinated when it is available,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/contracted-covid-after-1st-jab-dont-skip-2nd-after-cure/articleshow/82265426.cms||---

While new pyre platforms are being added across the city crematoria to push them to the maximum capacity, South Delhi Municipal Corporation plans to create temporary human funeral pyre platforms on the project site meant for the first municipal dog crematorium of the city in Dwarka Sector -29. “Temporary pyre platforms will be developed to cater to additional bodies. We are witnessing an increase of over 15-20% in cremations daily,” said a corporation official. The crematorium site, which is spread over 3.5 acres, has not been in operation yet. Around six months ago, the civic body approved the cremation rates for this upcoming animal crematorium. SDMC standing committee had approved the establishment of a small animal crematorium on PPP mode. Last week, 650 funeral pyres were reserved for the Covid bodies, which were increased to 773, and currently stand at 882 bodies per day. “With around 700 bodies already being cremated, we have to prepare for 1,000 bodies a day in advance to avoid chaos. We have also identified sites along the Yamuna to increase the capacity,” an official said. The city has also seen an expansion of crematoriums in parking lots and parks along the funeral centres, as both the Covid and the non-Covid cremations have seen a multi-fold increase. Delhi saw 696 Covid protocol funerals on Tuesday till 6pm, while many awaited their turn.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dog-crematorium-site-to-be-used-for-humans/articleshow/82282034.cms||Paras Singh

Congress president Sonia Gandhi is insisting on free vaccines and accordingly we brief the CM, who is considering the proposal. Before taking a final decision, we will have to work out an action plan and work out modalities for the vaccination drive,” Thorat said. Thorat said Congress-ruled Rajasthan, Punjab and Chhattisgarh have already declared their plan to provide free vaccination and it is the demand of the Congress. NCP minister Nawab Malik had told TOI on Sunday that the state government was determined to provide free vaccines to people in the age group of 18 to 45. Malik said on Monday, “We will have to mobilize Rs 4,800 crore for the purpose. We expect that a decision will be taken in a day or two.” On Sunday, minister Aaditya Thackeray had endorsed Malik’s statement. However, in the evening, he deleted his tweet, saying the high-powered committee should be allowed to take a decision. According to a bureaucrat, out of the six crore population in the 18-45 age-group, it has been proposed to administer Covishield to four crore people and Covaxin to two crore, but all will depend on availability of vaccines. “We expect the CM to take a decision in the cabinet meeting, and it will come into force from May 1, which is Maharashtra Day,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-congress-voices-its-displeasure-over-ncps-unilateral-free-vaccination-talk/articleshow/82265433.cms||---

The move has come following the request of the civic body. Although the exact amount will be ascertained when the bills will be approved, as the MC spends around Rs 50 to 60 crore in a month on necessary expenditures, the entire April expenditure will be taken through this order. The accounts department will prepare the details of each bill and get the approval from the senior officers. The amount will be largely spent on salaries and wages of employees, crucial and minor works of the city, payments under the dedicated fund against works like road recarpeting in the city and village development, and payment through GeM. The MC will spend this entire amount from its own revenue receipts. Sources in the civic body said the budget is expected to be approved in the first month of the May, so only April’s expenditure is required so far. But if the approval lingers and is not approved in May too, the amount will also be taken in the same manner for that month. There are high chances that budget will be approved in the early days of May. The general house of the MC earlier this year had prepared and passed Rs 1,627 crore budget for the current financial year from the administration, but the UT had given Rs 502 crore grant-in-aid (GIA).

The sudden decision by authorities to stop oxygen supply for those under home-based Covid care left the Coronavirus patients and their family members destressed. They heaved a sigh of relief by evening when the office on special duty (OSD) Vinod Rao put the decision on hold after a meeting with MLAs and MP.“It is a relief as we will now be able to supply oxygen to the needy. I don’t know why such an abrupt decision was taken to stop oxygen for home-based Covid care. It created so much panic among the Covid patients and their relatives. We got so many calls for oxygen bottles on Monday and had to turn away the needy,” said Sandeep Kharadi who runs Ma Khodiyar Foundation that is giving oxygen bottles for free to the home quarantined patients.To rationalize use of oxygen, Rao had issued a notification on Sunday wherein 164 small hospitals that were designated as Covid hospitals were asked to not admit patients needing oxygen therapy. The notification also included stopping oxygen to home quarantined Covid patients. Many Barodians started making panic calls to the hospitals on Monday to find out if beds equipped with oxygen are available.A resident of Gorwa, whose grandmother is under home-based Covid care, said, “We understand the need to rationalize use of oxygen. But what will the old patients who are quarantined at home and need oxygen do? They won’t get hospital bed at short notice.”Member of another social organization that is supplying oxygen to the needy for free said, “The decision to stop oxygen supply for home quarantined patients led to a momentary panic on Monday. It is good that the notification has been put on hold.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/home-quarantined-patients-heave-a-sigh-of-relief/articleshow/82264534.cms||Tushar Tere

---||Delhi||Health inspectors to check crowding||New Delhi: To make sure people don’t crowd crematoriums in the city and follow Covid guidelines, civic bodies have deputed public health inspectors in different shifts. They have been making repeated public announcements urging people to maintain social distancing, wear masks and dispose of their waste properly. “Our crematoriums are overburdened and operational till 3 am. We are increasing capacity at all five sites and planning to designate more crematoriums for Covid patients. We have also written to Delhi Development Authority for providing space for burial grounds. As far as the management at crematoriums is concerned, we are serious. Though it is not a place where we can impose norms strictly, we still request people to maintain distance,” said Nirmal Jain, mayor of East Delhi Municipal Corporation. “We have deputed public health inspectors at each of these crematoriums and burial grounds in two-three shifts to make sure there is no chaos at the slip issuing counters,” he said further. A senior south corporation official said that while the crematoriums were opening early, bodies from hospitals were arriving only after 10 am. At times, 10-12 bodies were coming together, which was leading to long queues outside the crematoriums. “It takes at least 10 minutes to complete the process before issuing a slip. We are also planning to start a public announcement requesting people to maintain social distancing and wait patiently for their numbers,” he said. The north corporation has already started the exercise of public announcement at Nigambodh Ghat where visitors’ turnout is quite high. “Our staff workers are also requesting people to take precautions. The footfall is quite high and we are working beyond our capacity,” said mayor Jai Prakash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/health-inspectors-to-check-crowding/articleshow/82282036.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Let vax recipients donate blood between two shots’||Mumbai: After the Centre increased the gap between two vaccine shots, activists want it to now allow people to donate blood in the interim period and not wait for 60 days without donating. The central health ministry, though, has not yet issued updated guidelines on blood donations between vaccine shots. With the mass vaccination drive for the 18-15 age group —who also comprise the biggest group of blood donors —scheduled to start on May 1, NGOs involved in voluntary blood donation are worried that the earlier notification would lead to blood stocks dipping further in the city. On March 5, the governing body of the National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC) approved the deferral criteria for blood donation as “28 days post vaccination”, irrespective of the type of vaccine received. “The deferral period may be reviewed as and when necessary,” said the note signed by NBTC director Sunil Gupta on March 5. As per this notification, people cannot donate blood for 56 days after the first vaccination. After the March 5 notification, the central health ministry increased the gap between two Covishield shots from 28 days to between four and eight weeks, and up to 42 days between two Covaxin shots. Think Foundation’s Vinay Shetty has written to the council seeking clarity in this regard. “I assume that by the ‘last’ dose you mean the last dose that was taken, irrespective of whether the last dose taken was the first one or the second. In other words, after every dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, there is a deferral period of 28 days for blood donation,” he has asked. India’s deferral period for blood donation is already among the longest. The American Red Cross has a deferral period of 14 days for vaccines made from live attenuated virus and none for mRNA vaccines. The UK has a deferral period of seven days for the Oxford vaccine, which is called Covishield in India. When contacted, NBTC’s Dr Shrinivas Murty said, “As per the rules, blood donation post-Covid vaccination can be done only after 28 days of receiving the last dose of the vaccine. If the two doses are 30 days apart, then one can donate after 28 days thereafter.” However, he added the rule was made at a time when the gap between shots was 30 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-let-vax-recipients-donate-blood-between-two-shots/articleshow/82265431.cms||---

The prescribed time limit for the second jab of Covishield vaccine is eight weeks from the first dose. It is six weeks from the first dose for Covaxin. Pramod Agarwal (70) said, “My wife and I took our first dose on March 5. For last 10 days, we have been trying to book a slot for our second dose, but in vain. Now, we are into the eighth week since the first dose and with acute shortage of vaccines we are very worried as we are not able to get it at nearby hospitals or vaccination centres.” Former MLA Medha Kulkarni has written letters to the municipal commissioner, collector, and head of health department at PMC, highlighting the issues faced by senior citizens. “I have proposed a system of putting up a schedule at the hospitals with names of people, dates and time slots.”  City immunisation officer Vaishali Jadhav, said, “The second dose of Covishield vaccine can be delayed up to eight weeks from the first dose. However, when it comes to Covaxin, the second dose needs to be taken between four to six weeks.” Prasad Kulkarni, Serum Institute of India’s vaccine researcher, clarified that the second dose of Covishield can be delayed up to 12 weeks or even thereafter. “Oxford university study has shown excellent antibody response when the second dose is taken at 12 weeks or even thereafter,” he said.

---||Pune||Centre suggests vax hubs for seniors, dubs home jabs ‘risky’||Pune: Central health officials have suggested setting up of dedicated vaccination centres for senior citizens considering the difficulty in monitoring them in home environment in case of any adverse events following immunisation. Even as states such as Maharashtra explore the option of home vaccination for the elderly, the officials dubbed the move “risky” as the protocol demands monitoring of a person for 30 minutes post the jab, which would be difficult in a home setting. Central officials told TOI that they had received requests for home vaccination from various states, but said it was not practically feasible in the current scenario. “We have had several discussions on the same with various states. In case the states want to facilitate senior citizens, they should set up dedicated centres for them and allot them time slots for vaccination,” said a central health official. The official further added that there was possibility of contamination of vaccines during transit in case of home vaccination and it would logistically be difficult to monitor those getting the jabs for 30 minutes for any adverse reaction. State health minister Rajesh Tope told TOI on Monday that the government was exploring ways of carrying out vaccination following protocols. “We are discussing with experts how to go about the vaccination drive as there are many senior citizens who are unable to step out of home,” he said. Many ministers have demand home vaccination. Dr NK Arora, advisor to Adverse Events Following Immunisation Committee, told TOI that it is essential to monitor citizens for 30 minutes after vaccination and it has to be done in a hospital setting. “We do not advice it anywhere else,’’ he said Meanwhile, the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry (HUA) has asked real estate industry bodies to get all construction workers vaccinated at building sites at the organisations’ expense.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/centre-suggests-vax-hubs-for-seniors-dubs-home-jabs-risky/articleshow/82264538.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Patna||Railway official kills wife, self in Patna||PATNA: A 49-year-old railway official killed his wife by slitting her throat before jumping off the 4th floor flat of an apartment to death in Patna on Monday. The deceased, Atul Lal, was posted as station manager of route relay interlocking system at Patna Junction. His wife, Tulika Prasad, 42, was a housewife. They have a 16-year-old daughter and a 15-year-old son. The incident took place around 7am at Om Residency on Parvati Path at New Chitragupta Nagar under Patrakagar Nagar police station area. The children raised an alarm when they saw their father slitting the mother’s throat with a sharp-edged weapon. But none of the neighbours came as they feared that the woman had tested positive for Covid-19. Atul got nervous after seeing the children and jumped off the 4th floor flat. Patrakar Nagar police station SHO Ravindra Kumar said no weapon was recovered from the room where the body of Tulika was found. Both the bodies were later sent to the NMCH for postmortem. The SHO said prima facie the incident appeared to be a fallout of family feud. The couple used to quarrel on one pretext or another. A day earlier, they had an altercation over some issue. “Earlier, the neighbours used to intervene, but later they started ignoring it as it had become a routine affair,” an investigating officer quoted a flat owner of the apartment as saying. The apartment security guard told the police that he heard a loud thud on the ground floor around 7.15am. On reaching there, he found Atul lying in a pool of blood. He immediately informed the secretary of the apartment, who called the police. The inmates of the apartment told the police that the family had been living in the flat for over three years. The police have lodged an FIR on the statement of the deceased’s brother-in-law Deepak Kumar. “The statements of the deceased’s children will be recorded when the situation becomes normal. At present they are in a state of shock,” the SHO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rly-official-kills-wife-self-in-city/articleshow/82263266.cms||Ramashankar
---||Delhi||Migrants again pick exit route as lockdown is extended by a week||NEW DELHI: With the lockdown extended by a week, the crowds of migrant workers returning to their home villages began to swell again at the city’s bus terminals. Government officials claimed they were mostly going back to UP for the panchayat elections, but the lockdown extension had brought more searching for buses on Monday. During the weekend, 600-700 buses, each allowed to carry half its capacity as an anti-Covid precaution, had been arranged for labourers wanting to go back home. Sandeep Kumar, who lives in Badaun in Uttar Pradesh, declared that he was only heading back home to spend time with his family and even be present in his village for the panchayat elections. But a family of five which was eager to be back in the villages was less disingenuous. A member stated in all pragmatism that the family didn’t know if it could survive in Delhi considering the current circumstances and, therefore, felt it was a safer option to return to the village and live there for the time being. “More people arrived at the bus terminal on Monday due to the lockdown extension,” said a terminal official. “While many people want to avoid last year’s problems during the lockdown, there were also those who had relatives standing for elections or who had to help in the polls.” On Saturday, a woman who had come to the Anand Vihar inter-state bus terminal to find a bus to her hometown, died at the rear of the transport complex. “We informed the police after she fainted on the footpath. A police team came and collected the details about the incidents,” said a terminal official. “An ambulance took charge of the body. The area was then sanitised. The relatives of the woman told the cops that they were going back to their village to participate in the elections.” Over the weekend several hundred buses departed from the bus terminals at Anand Vihar and Kaushambi. Since the cases of coronavirus infection are on the rise, buses leaving the bus stations are sanitised and fewer than normal passengers are allowed to embark to maintain social distancing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/migrants-again-pick-exit-route-as-lockdown-is-extended-by-a-week/articleshow/82264550.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad city gets machines to replace manual scavengers||Aurangabad: Almost seven years after the Supreme Court abolished manual scavenging, Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has roped in automated buckets capable of cleaning the deepest manholes. Despite the SC-imposed ban, manual scavenging continued in Aurangabad — and still continues in different parts of Marathwada region — due to absence of any other effective mechanical substitute. The officials said that though they were using jetting machines to clean choked manholes and drainage lines, in some cases, manual intervention was required. The Aurangabad civic body has become the first in the region to get three automated machines. Given the results achieved by the civic body’s sanitary department over the past fortnight, the officials are thinking about getting three more machines that are installed on pickup autorickshaws. A vehicle-mounted machine costs Rs 10 lakh. Therefore, the civic body purchased just the machines and installed them on pickup autorickshaws that were in use to collect waste. As a result, the civic body had to spend less on each machine. If things go according to plan, each of the nine wards will soon have their own machines. Moreover, these machines can also be used for cleaning wells for Ganesh immersion. Civic body administrator Astik Kumar Pandey recently took up the initiative to bring awareness against deploying manual scavengers by individual citizens as well as businesses and corporate houses. This was immediately followed by procurement of three machines from Gujarat through a contractor. In the pilot project, 25 choked manholes were cleaned in eight days Maharashtra, with 7, 378 manual scavengers, has the second highest number of people engaged in the abolished practice in the country. As per the central government’s figures, as of February 2021, there are 66,692 manual scavengers in India. Of them, 37,792 are in Uttar Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-city-gets-machines-to-replace-manual-scavengers/articleshow/82264545.cms||---

Another team reached the building where the woman was. “The teams across tried to speak to her, but she was in no mood to listen,” said an officer.

Majority of those in the queues were family members of critically ill patients in home isolation and those sent by the hospitals to get cylinders refilled. “This is strange. I read statements of district administration officers in newspaper saying that oxygen needs of all the hospitals were being met, but the hospital in Balaganj, where my 66-year-old brother-in-law is under treatment, admitted him on the condition that I will have to arrange for the oxygen,” said Ganesh Joshi, a private caterer, standing outside a plant in Nadarganj. He had to admit his relative to a non-Covid facility as no beds were available in Covid hospitals. Utsav Kukreja, a Chowk resident, was standing in the queue outside a plant in Talkatora for a refill for his 55-year-old mother under treatment in a hospital in Dubagga. “Administration should take action against hospitals who are asking family members to arrange oxygen,” he said Vikram Bafila, who was standing outside a plant in Talkatora to get a refill for four hours, said, “My 71-year-old father needs oxygen urgently, but I have been waiting here for hours. Who would be responsible if he dies? There should be a separate arrangement for home isolation patients because they are the ones who are managing all alone.” Meanwhile, Sanjay Agarwal, son of an MLA from Hardoi, alleged that his younger brother Ashiish (36), died due to low oxygen supplies in a hospital on IIM Road. However, hospital owner Dr Sandeep Gupta said that there was no shortage of oxygen in the hospital. “Ashish was put on a ventilator because of severe lung infection, but he did not survive. Currently, we have 16 patients on oxygen support and seven in ICU,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/oxygen-crisis-far-from-over-kin-wait-for-hours-in-queues/articleshow/82265439.cms||Pranchal Srivastava

Parida said these associations can set up these centres with 10 or more beds for their members under the supervision of available health care workers from government or private health institutions. “Our city should be dotted with such mini Covid care centres that provide bed, food, and care up to oxygen level. Our community centres are also available. UT can also use some bhawans. Philanthropists can fund few of these centres, which will be meant for poor patients,” Parida said. Sources said the administration is also in touch with retired doctors or other health care professionals, who have left their job. A senior official said in this second wave, people can voluntarily offer their services to the administration. It will certainly help Covid management plan, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/parida-pitches-for-small-covid-care-centres/articleshow/82261749.cms||---

The accused, Syed Mohammed Saqib and Syed Mohammad Amir were booked under the Epidemic Act and are likely to be arrested, said police. The FIR was lodged after a probe team comprising chief medical officer (CMO) Barabanki, Dr RN Verma and SHO Pankaj Singh blew the lid off the hospital’s claims and found the babies had not been brought to the hospital, but died at a neighbouring clinic. Also, there was surplus oxygen in the children’s facility on April 24 — when the hospital claimed it ran out of the lifesaving gas, triggering the deaths. SP, Barabanki, Yamuna Prasad, said, the district administration took swift cognizance of reports in TV channels about two babies gasping to death at Awadh Children Hospital and a probe team was constituted. During investigation, hospital owner’s elder brother, Syed Mohammed Amir and on-duty doctor Dr Shadab Rasool told police the babies were admitted at 7.15 am, but died within hours due to lack of oxygen. “A similar statement was also issued by the hospital owner on TV channels,” said the SP. However, the probe revealed that between April 21 and April 24, the hospital received 13 jumbo oxygen cylinders and had sufficient stock. Misleading statements by the hospital owner triggered panic among patients in Barabanki, said the police officer. The police team also searched the hospital premises and spoke to the infants’ parents, Ethesham and Mantasha. “The parents denied taking the babies to Awadh Children Hospital. The infants were born premature and died at Krishna Polyclinic. Despite adequate oxygen supply, the hospital administration gave false statements to tarnish the image of the district administration,” said SP, Barabanki Additional director general, law and order, Prashant Kumar, on Monday said, the hospital administration was refusing to admit patients and was peddling lies on unavailability of oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hosp-owners-peddle-lies-on-babies-death-booked/articleshow/82265449.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Over 7.5L senior citizens in city have taken first shot, 1.44L both||Mumbai: A record number of people queued up to take vaccination shot in the state on Monday after an acute shortage of doses was experienced at nearly all private centres over the past week, prompting many to stop inoculation. Civic officials said news of fresh stocks arriving brought many who were waiting for the second dose on Monday. So far, over 7.5 lakh senior citizens have taken the first dose in Mumbai while 1.44 lakh have taken both doses. Similarly, less than 50,000 from the age group of 45-59 have taken the second dose, while over 7.48 lakh have taken the first one. Anand Kadkol, who stood for hours at the Nesco vaccination centre in Goregaon, questioned on Twitter whether the system was ready to open vaccination for all considering how the elderly were struggling to get their first and second doses. A 70-year-old woman, who went to a private hospital in Vile Parle, did not get the vaccine despite waiting six hours. Dr Neelam Andrade, dean of Nesco, said they have tied up with NGOs for crowd management. “The rush was extraordinary on Monday and the footfall must have exceeded 3,000-4,000,” she said, adding they had used up most of the 7,500 doses they received on Monday. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer said the city had doses to sustain the drive for two more days. At private centres like Holy Spirit in Andheri, CEO Sneha Joseph said they could vaccinate 516 people and had to turn away the rest. “We had requested for 300 vials (3,000 doses) but got only 90. We may be able to vaccinate only a few hundred on Tuesday,” she said. Dr Lalit Sankhe, nodal officer of JJ Hospital’s vaccination centre, said they have exhausted Covaxin doses. “If we get stocks, priority will mostly be given to those due for second doses. We have enough Covishield,” he said. Dr Vyas said the state completed vaccinating a total of 1.48crore citizens with at least one dose by Monday evening. Congratulating immunisation teams, CM Uddhav Thackeray and health minister Rajesh Tope said the target was to double daily vaccination hereon. When asked about availability of doses, Vyas said, “Government of India (GOI) says consume supplies and (then) ask. We believe that GOI will support us,” he added. Prior to the 5 lakh daily vaccination record, the state had set a national record on April 3 by vaccinating 4.62 lakh in a day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-over-7-5l-senior-citizens-in-city-have-taken-first-shot-1-44l-both/articleshow/82265455.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Collectors are dumping the garbage at common sites without segregating it from houses of patients. A reality check by TOI revealed garbage being collected irrespective of the fact that the house is having a Covid patient or not. The collectors were also not carrying specified colour bags to be used for the waste. They were also not wearing any protection suit and vehicle was now marked with Covid garbage caution sign. Private garbage collectors take the garbage at a common site, from where the MC further takes it to MC dumping ground. Kamal Kumar, a resident of Dhakoli, said, “We have not seen any one specially lifting garbage from any of the infected patients’ houses. None of these houses is marked or cordoned off. The garbage is being collected normally.” However, MC officials in Zirakpur said that they have no idea about the garbage collection as per Covid norms. Dhakoli had been declared as a containment zone as 57% of the total cases of Dhakoli surfaced in April this year. The data shows that in the 26 days of April, 2,135 positive cases have surfaced from Dhakoli. The containment zone has been divided into 10 areas to speed up testing. Testing and vaccination teams have already been deployed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/at-containment-zone-covid-waste-is-not-separated/articleshow/82263265.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

In the last three days, at least 10 teaching and non-teaching staff members of Delhi University and two senior professors of Jamia Millia Islamia have died due to Covid-19. This has triggered panic in the teaching community.“People are defenceless and despite trying so much, nothing is working out for them,” said Aditya Narayan Mishra, former DU Teachers’ Association (DUTA) president and an associate professor at Sri Aurobindo College.“I have spent my whole life helping people but right now, we are helpless as we cannot find oxygen cylinders, hospital deaths, medicines, etc. We are losing good and trained minds,” he said citing the death of Sri Aurobindo College English department teacher Vipin Singh Chauhan who passed away on Monday. He requested the university and the government to provide financial help to the family of the deceased teachers.Richa Malhotra, associate professor of history at College of Vocational Studies, passed away on Monday. Her colleague Kumar Ashutosh said that “the university should make sure that no teacher is called to the colleges. It must also compensate the families of the deceased teachers.”DUTA, in its letter to DU vice-chancellor PC Joshi on April 25, had also requested monetary compensation for the kin of the deceased teachers. Delhi University dean of colleges Balaram Pani told TOI: “We have asked our Teachers’ Welfare Fund committee on April 25 to prepare guidelines and initiate the process of monetary assistance and compensation. ”Jamia Millia Islamia also revealed on Monday that its two senior professors passed away due to Covid-19 in the last one week.

Earlier, two incidents of attack on doctors and paramedics were reported from Wanowrie and Kondhwa in Pune, while the third was reported at Dehu Road Cantonment Hospital (under the jurisdiction of the Pimpri Chinchwad police). Supervisor Mukesh Upalkar of Rao Nursing Home, the DCHC, told TOI, “A Covid-19 patient expired in the hospital and his body was handed over to his family at 4pm on Sunday. Two hours later, two men came and picked up a dispute with our doctors and nurses, accusing them of causing the patient’s death. We counselled them and shared information on the circumstances leading to the death, but they were in no mood to listen. The duo later left.”Upalakar said, “Around 8pm, three men came. One of them damaged the cash counter glass with an iron rod and then they fled. A CCTV camera has captured the incident. An inquiry revealed that our security guards tried to stop the trio, but they did not listen to them and barged into the hospital with an intention to cause damage. We have also appointed a bouncer, but he was patrolling the hospital premises then. No one was injured. The cash counter was empty because the cashier was on leave.” Senior inspector Sunil Zavare said, “We have collected the CCTV footage. We have established the identity of the three men.

---||Kolkata||Covid-19 in West Bengal: More beds freed but fall short of demand spike||KOLKATA: The count of Covid patients being discharged from hospitals is going up and beds are being freed up at a regular basis. But these are being taken up within hours. Despite augmenting the number of beds, hospitals continue to reel under severe bed crisis because of the steeply increasing number of positive cases. On Saturday, the day the state health department issued a new discharge policy, the number of patients discharged jumped to 7,584 from of 6,879 the previous day. On Monday, it went up further to 9,775. In spite of the rising number of discharges, a number of patients in need of oxygen support are being taken care of at home because of unavailability of beds. “The new discharge policy was issued to decongest hospitals beds so that serious patients who hospital care get medical attention on time,” said a health department official. The surging numbers, especially in Kolkata, where new cases are inching towards 4,000, have made it extremely difficult for hospitals tide over the crisis. For example, Peerless Hospital had taken up their bed count to 160 from 63. The hospital informed patients who have been on waiting list about the bed augmentation. Even as the work on converting three more wards into Covid-19 zone was going on, some patients had started turning up, fearing that they might not get a bed in case of delay. “We are increasing the patient turnover as much as possible and also raising the bed count. But the rush is too much. A fleet of ambulance with Covid patients arrived just when we were adding 97 beds, including 27 CCU ones,” said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra. The scene is no different at government-run hospitals. Sources in the health department said hospitals like NRS Medical College, RG Kar and Calcutta National Medical College already have more patients than allocated bed strength. “The number of new cases, at 15,992, was almost double of 9,775 discharged on Monday. So the pressure will be there. But if all hospitals stick to the new policy, the discharge rate should go up,” said a senior doctor with the state government. “We are constantly increasing our Covid beds and by Tuesday, we will have 217 beds, including 80 CCU and HDU ones. But the number of patients is huge,” said Simmardeep Gill, COO of CMRI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/more-beds-freed-but-fall-short-of-demand-spike/articleshow/82263817.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Chandigarh||Positivity rate climbs to 21%||Chandigarh: The city positivity rate has been between 19 and 21% since a week now. On Monday, 821 cases, including five deaths, were reported. The positivity rate was 21%. The number of tests has been fluctuating between 3,000 and 4,500 a day, taking the average testing to around 3,000. Even while tests per million per day is 3,333, which is above the national average of 1035, it is considered low by public health experts during this surge. The seven day moving average daily growth is 1.89, while the national average has risen to 2%. Under the health care workers’ category, the city falls in less than 75% vaccination coverage category. “The vaccination coverage is lowest amongst the health care workers as compared to the other priority group. And this category is at the highest risk. In fact, they can be a source of faster transmission to the weak patients,” said a public health expert. Based on prediction modelling done, it is expected that the surge will continue until mid of May. “Lowering the testing is not a public health strategy to control the numbers. If the testing is enhanced, there is immediate tracing and treatment. Else, the spread cannot be controlled,” said the public health expert. Within a week there have been 4,967 cases, including 23 deaths. The city was witnessing 200 cases every day last month and within no time the doubled and quadrupled to over 800 cases since April 23. “Since the past one week, there are almost four deaths on an average daily. This is expected to rise with the number of cases going up,” said a public health expert.

---||Delhi||Centre with 150 O2 beds starts on Radha Soami Beas campus||New Delhi: The Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre at Radha Soami Satsang Beas in south Delhi’s Chhatarpur was restarted on Monday with 150 oxygen beds, which will eventually be scaled up to 5,000 beds.During a presser on Monday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the state government is trying to increase oxygen beds in the capital. “Today morning, I visited the centre that has been created at Radha Soami Satsang Beas. It has started functioning,” he said.“There are 150 beds as of now, in the next two-three days this will be pushed to 500, then 2,000 and finally 5,000 beds. We are also creating a 200 ICU-bed facility at the centre,” Kejriwal said. “We will start several such centres in Delhi and hope they aid Delhiites,” he added.“Grateful to Babaji for helping us. Thank you central government for providing doctors and medical staff of ITBP,” Kejriwal tweeted.The centre, which was first started in July last year when the capital was reeling under the first wave of Covid-19, was not in use since earlier this year after Delhi saw a major dip in cases. The re-opening on Monday, however, was marred by chaotic scenes outside its gates as a large number of Covid-19 patients and their relatives from not only south Delhi but different areas of NCR landed up looking for beds.According to the ‘admission protocol’ of the centre, only district surveillance officials can refer cases after assessment of details and eligibility and walk-in patients are not admitted. Those who test positive can call the helpline number given to them for home isolation or 011-26655547/8/9 or 011-26655949/69 to request for admission. However, some people gathered outside the centre complained that helplines were constantly busy.ITBP has arranged oxygen beds and healthcare personnel at the centre and Delhi government is bearing all other expenses, apart from accommodation of healthcare personnel. A team of 50 doctors from ITBP and other organisations and around 80 other healthcare personnel have been deployed at the centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-with-150-o2-beds-starts-on-radha-soami-beas-campus/articleshow/82264571.cms||---

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Control room to infuse life into oxygen supply to hosps||KOLKATA: A control room for ensuring smooth supply of medical oxygen started operation at Swasthya Bhawan on Monday. To be manned round the clock by 12 health officials on roster, hospitals — both private and government — have been asked to contact them in case any facility faced an oxygen crisis. This move comes after an apprehension of crisis in the face of rising number of Covid patients requiring oxygen support. On Monday, the state health department asked all government hospitals to develop oxygen production plants without being dependent on the supply from the Centre. To set up the unit, hospitals till the level of state general hospital were asked to earmark 152sqm plots. With hardly any oxygen cylinders available in medical stores, relatives of a few patients are paying exorbitant sums to source cylinders from the black market. A 1,400-litre cylinder, which used to lease at Rs 8,000-Rs 9,000, is now commanding Rs 25,000-Rs 65,000 while portable cans are going at Rs 2,500 instead of Rs 250-Rs 400. However, the crisis is yet to be felt in hospitals. “So far there is no shortage of oxygen supply in the state, especially in liquid medical oxygen (LMO), though there is some problem with oxygen cylinders,” said an official.  DIG traffic and an IPS officer from fire and emergency department have been designated as nodal officers to coordinate easy movement of tankers or vehicles carrying cylinders. “The demand for LMO has gone up by about 50% and is expected to shoot up further. We didn’t face a crisis during the first wave, but given the number of rising cases and patients requiring oxygen, we might face shortage issues soon. Therefore any pro-active measure is welcome,” said the head of a corporate hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/control-room-to-infuse-life-into-oxygen-supply-to-hosps/articleshow/82263822.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Former chief secretary of Madhya Pradesh Anthony D’Sa, who also served as the chairman of the Madhya Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA), has been appointed to take over as the liquidator of the former bank. A 1980 batch IAS officer, D’Sa will oversee the liquidation of MUCB’s assets and recovery of all outstanding dues. “My term was for a year and it came to an end on April 23. I did not want an extension,” said Hawaldar. D’Sa formally took over charge as the liquidator on Monday. One of the major tasks before D’Sa will be to oversee the disbursement of the pending deposits that have to be transferred to accounts of the customers. Many shareholders and account holders are peeved with the lengthy delay in disbursals and the lack of transparency. “There should have been a fortnightly notification for the benefit of the over two lakh depositors,” said Joseph Carneiro, one of the many depositors of MUCB. Carneiro, along with three other depositors, filed a petition before the Goa Human Rights Commission seeking that their hard earned money should be “dispersed expeditiously” to provide the depositors relief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hawaldar-ends-term-as-mapusabank-liquidator/articleshow/82265459.cms||---
---||Delhi||Over 200 inmates, 60 staff members test positive in Delhi jails||NEW DELHI: A crisis seems to be brewing in Delhi jails with active cases about to touch the 300 mark. At least 227 inmates have tested positive and are recovering apart from at least 60 staff members, officials say. The women’s jail is badly hit with around 45 cases, sources claim. Even inmates in high-security cells like Chhota Rajan have tested positive apart from inmates like Shahabuddin and Umar Khalid. Sources say the cases may rise significantly if asymptomatic inmates are tested in overcrowded jails. The population of all the three prisons (Rohini, Mandoli & Tihar) combined is around 20,663 as compared to the strength of 10,026. Between mid-March and mid-April, around 70 inmates and 11 staff members had tested positive for Covid, taking the total number of prisoners affected since last year to 190 and 304 prison staff so far. However, cases rose quickly from mid-April. Officials are struggling to find a solution as social distancing is not possible in crowded jails and decongestion doesn’t seem like an option. Last year, a large number of inmates had been granted bail and parole and many of them did not return. At least 3,468 inmates of the three Delhi prisons, who were released to decongest the jails during the pandemic, are yet to return. Jail authorities have shared their details with police to ensure they are tracked and are brought back. Last year, 1,184 convicts were released on emergency parole of which 112 are yet to return. Similarly, 5,500 undertrials were released on interim bail by courts of which only around 2,000 have returned. Tihar DG Sandeep Goel has ordered that all precautionary measures be taken and a mandatory check-up for those above 60 who are lodged in prisons be carried out every day across prisons. The prison administration had recently suspended meetings of prisoners with their relatives and family members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/over-200-inmates-60-staff-members-test-positive-in-jails/articleshow/82264578.cms||---

---||Delhi||3 held for hoarding, selling of O2 cylinders in black mkt||New Delhi: Delhi Police has arrested three men for allegedly smuggling oxygen cylinders, nitrogen cylinders and flow meters to sell them in black market at higher rates in south Delhi’s Ghitorni. Four oxygen cylinders, five nitrogen cylinders, 20 flow meters and a car used for smuggling have been recovered from the trio. The arrested men have been identified as 23-year-old Mohit, a resident of Jharoda Kalan, Ansar Ahmed (41) from Shaheen Bagh and Sumit Saini (33) from Palam Vihar in Gurgaon. Police said Ahmed was the main accused in this case. He works as a technical director in the ICU of a hospital and also has 10% partnership in that hospital. Mohit works for Ahmed, who also owns a godown of old medical equipment and logistics in Aya Nagar. Sumit is a partner and an engineer who used to repair old medical equipment. Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Thakur said that on Monday, they received a tip-off that one man would come near Ghitorni Metro Station to sell oxygen cylinders to someone at a high rate. “On this, a trap was laid near the metro station and a suspicious Maruti Swift Car was intercepted. The driver was identified as Mohit. On searching the car, we recovered two oxygen cylinders,” Thakur said. Mohit told the cops that the bigger oxygen cylinders were being sold at Rs 50,000 while the smaller ones for Rs 30,000 to those in need. “He disclosed the names of Sumit and Ansar Ahmed and said that they used to supply him the oxygen cylinders to further sell them in the black market. Based on his information, the other two were also arrested and four more oxygen cylinders along with five nitrogen cylinders and several flow meters from Mahipal farms in Aaya Nagar were seized,” the DCP said. All the three were booked for cheating and under relevant sections of The Essential Commodities Act and Epidemic Diseases Act. Further interrogation revealed that the trio used to take old or scrapped cylinders from scrap dealers and from the auctions at government hospitals. “They then used to hoard these cylinders and sell them whenever their demand increased. Efforts to verify other hoarders of life saving drugs and equipment are under way,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3-held-for-hoarding-selling-of-o2-cylinders-in-black-mkt/articleshow/82282051.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Justice Gautam Patel heard a testamentary petition filed by the siblings for letters of administration to the property and credits of Rajiv, who died without having made a will on February 9. The petition said Rajiv married Aarti Sabharwal in 2001 and they divorced in 2003. Senior advocate Sharan Jagtiani, for the siblings, submitted that the HC registry has asked for a certified copy of the divorce decree. They sought a dispensation to submit the decree saying they do not have a copy of it and do not even know which family court passed it. “The sister and brother are the only heirs to his estate. We don’t have access to the decree of the divorce. We tried to look for it, but were not able to locate it. We seek dispensation,” said Jagtiani. To his query whether the 2003 decree was not uploaded on the family court’s website, Justice Patel was told the case details were not known or whether it was filed in Mumbai or Delhi. “It was an acrimonious divorce,” Jagtiani added. Justice Patel, in his order, said in Rima’s additional affidavit of April 21, there is a re-affirmation of fact of this divorce. “It notes that there is some material in the public domain that makes a mention of the divorce,” he said. Justice Patel said he is prepared to dispense with the requisition from the registry “but upon the petitioners giving a sworn undertaking that they will make reasonable efforts to locate the decree of divorce and, if found, will tender a certified copy to the registry”. However, he added that this does not mean that the progress of the testamentary petition “which is uncontested and lists only the petitioners as next of kin, should be stopped or the grant withheld only for this reason”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/submit-actor-rajiv-kapoors-divorce-decree-in-mumbai-hc-to-siblings/articleshow/82265475.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Pune||18-45 vaccination drive may be delayed in Maharashtra: Officials||PUNE: State health officials on Monday said it is still uncertain whether Maharashtra will be able to start vaccinating all adults from May 1. Revisions in the national vaccination policy and the ongoing shortage of vaccines could delay the launch, they said. “Until the state government or private hospitals directly place orders with manufacturers to get their quota of doses, vaccinations for everyone between 18 and 45 may not kick off in Maharashtra,” a senior official from the state public health department said. The official said, “People in this age bracket are now supposed to get their shots from private hospitals from May 1, unless the state works out an alternative plan. Private hospitals will have to first place their demand to manufacturers after which vaccine makers will be able to supply as per the open-market policy.” After May 1, the state government will stop supplying doses to private vaccination sites from its quota routed through the Centre, the official pointed out. “The supply of doses from the Centre will be utilized only in state government-run Covid Vaccination Centers (CVCs), meant for healthcare workers, frontline staff and those aged above 45,” the official said. Other officials too said coverage for all above 18 may not start immediately after May 1 since, besides the vaccine shortage, private vaccination sites will have to first get their supply directly from manufacturers. The health ministry had recently announced that manufacturers are to give 50% of their monthly Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL)-released doses to the Centre. They would, however, be free to supply the remaining doses to state governments and the private sector. “Due to this, the Rs 250 per dose charge by private vaccination centres will be discontinued from May 1. This fee was only applicable on doses purchased by private vaccination centres from the Union government’s vaccine quota set for the state,” the official said. Currently, the state’s quota of vaccines is supplied to both public and private vaccination sites. But after May 1, private centres will be purchasing doses directly from manufacturers at a price set by the latter. Also, the state’s share in the Centre’s vaccine kitty is set to reduce from May 1 as manufacturers will be limiting supply to the latter. A state health official said, “Maharashtra received about nine lakh doses on Sunday, which should suffice till Wednesday. There’s still no clarity on when we will get more doses from that 50% quota set aside by the Centre to states.” Officials said the Centre will also no longer be involved in giving permissions for new vaccination sites. "The state government will decide if it will be the one issuing permits or district authorities," another official said. Asked if private hospitals have started placing their orders from manufacturers, Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary, public health department said policy was still under discussion. Dr Jayesh Lele, national secretary-general of Indian Medical Association (IMA) said, "There is still no clarity on the drive for everyone between 18 and 44. The two vaccine makers (SII and Bharat Biotech) have said there won't be enough doses for all immediately. So far, no private hospital in the state has received direct supply from them."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/18-45-vax-drive-may-be-delayed-in-maharashtra-officials/articleshow/82264588.cms||Neha Madaan
---||India||Centre asks states to implement local containment SOPs||NEW DELHI: The Centre on Monday directed all states and Union Territories to implement an intensive, local and focused containment framework, stressing on specific districts and areas identified based on prescribed criteria, to break the chain of transmission and control the unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases. In a letter to state chief secretaries and UT administrators, home secretary Ajay Bhalla drew their attention to the health ministry’s April 25 advisory on containment strategy and said district authorities should be sensitised on the strategy for imposing restrictions. He also said the orders issued by state/UT governments and district authorities on imposing restrictions should be widely disseminated to the public and field functionaries for effective implementation. Bhalla said in the recent past, a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases was observed along with a high positivity rate. Considering this unprecedented spike, he said there was an urgent need for states and UTs to consider strict Covid management and control measures in the surge areas to bring the situation under control. He said the health ministry had advised state/UT governments to implement an intensive, local and focused containment framework, focused on specific districts, cities and areas identified based on prescribed criteria. All states/UTs have been advised to consider a further graded response in accordance with the local situation, requirements and resources. “I would, therefore, urge you to issue directions to district authorities in your state/UT to take all necessary measures, as advised by MoHFW in their letter,” Bhalla said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-asks-states-to-implement-local-containment-sops/articleshow/82267053.cms||---

The blast occurred on the up line between Lotapahar and Sonua railway stations in Chakradharpur of West Singhbhum district. “Portions of the railway track was found 35 metres from the blast site,” the senior divisional commercial manager of Chakradharpur, Manish Kumar Pathak, said describing the intensity of the blast. The official informed that the blast occurred at 2:15am, following which train movement on the up and down line was suspended between Rourkela and Chakradharpur. In all, eight mail and express trains and several freight trains were controlled at different stations till the service resumed following restoration work at 9:35am. Howrah-Pune Express, Alleppey-Dhanbad express, Ahmedabad-Howrah express and Howrah-Ahmedabad express, among other trains, were controlled at Sonua, Chakradharpur, Sini and Rourkela stations, officials said. “Soon after the loco pilot of a goods train informed the station manager of Sonua about a heavy jerk on the up line, the safety and security team was rushed to the site and movement of the trains was suspended,” Pathak said. The restoration work was completed jointly by the district police, bomb detection and disposal squad, railway protection force and railway trackmen. Notably, Maoists had given a call for Bharat bandh on April 26 against the three controversial farm laws. The RPF and state police have started a probe into the incident. “A major rail accident was averted luckily. Had any passenger train passed on the sabotaged track, then it could have got derailed,” a railway official at the Tatanagar railway station said. Earlier, on Friday, Maoists had put up anti-establishment posters around the Lotapahar area calling for Bharat bandh. Notably, two passengers were killed and 30 passengers on board the Tata-Bilaspur passenger suffered injuries when the train was derailed following a Maoist-triggered blast on the Howrah-Mumbai line at Posaita railway station in Sonua in November 2009. In May 2012, Maoists had detained a Bilaspur-bound train and hung a can bomb from the engine of the train at Posaita railway station, terrifying the loco pilot and the passengers on board the train all through the hour-long journey from Posaita to Manoharpur in Chakradharpur. In the past one month, Maoist activities have reportedly increased in the Sonua, Toklo police station areas in Chakradharpur. Railway sources said that the timing of explosion suggests that Maoists had apparently targeted the Howrah-Pune Azad Hind Express that passes through Chakradharpur at 2am.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/maoists-blow-up-kol-mum-rail-line-in-west-singhbhum/articleshow/82263870.cms||B Sridhar

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand CM writes to Gujrat counterpart, seeks help in averting oxygen crisis||RANCHI: Chief minister Hemant Soren has stepped up efforts to ensure that the state doesn’t face any oxygen crisis in the wake of increasing number of Covid-19 cases. After inspecting oxygen refilling plants on Sunday, Soren on Monday wrote a letter to Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani. The Jharkhand CM wrote: “In light of the current situation prevailing in our country, where we are all reeling under the impact of the Covid-19 wave, I feel it is imperative that we work together to overcome this situation. My state, Jharkhand, is a surplus manufacturer of oxygen, the most vital lifesaving element in Covid treatment. Unfortunately, we are struggling with flow constraints in supply-chain due to the paucity of oxygen cylinders and the capacity of refiners available in Jharkhand. I have been informed that many of our orders of LMO tanks, vaporisers and cylinders are pending with manufacturers in Gujarat.” He further sought the Gujarat CM’s assistance in getting the manufacturers concerned to expedite the delivery of the aforementioned orders. “I request you to intervene on our behalf and help ensure the timely delivery of LMO tanks, vapourisers and cylinders to Jharkhand,” he added. The state government was also working to increase the number of oxygen-supported beds. Compared to about 2,500 oxygen-supported beds in the state until over a week ago, the government has now raised the figure to 10,000. A couple of days ago, Soren also launched Covid circuits in Ranchi and Jamshedpur to lessen the load on existing hospitals in these cities by putting to use the unutilised medical facilities in neighbouring districts. Soren launched another 100-bed Covid care centre at a community health centre in Doranda on Monday and reviewed the ongoing work for setting up a 300-bed facility at the Rims multilevel parking. Sources in the health department said that the state produces about 600 tons of oxygen daily while the existing requirement is close to 90 tons. “But owing to rising infections, the daily requirement is set to increase further. So the government is adding more oxygen-supported beds. Unfortunately, the state doesn’t have enough cylinders, vapourisers and LMO tanks,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jkhand-cm-writes-to-guj-counterpart-seeks-help-in-averting-oxygen-crisis/articleshow/82264218.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Covid surge forces cancellation of flights from Ranchi||RANCHI: The unprecedented surge of Covid-19 cases in Jharkhand is impacting air services with many flights connecting to big cities and metros from Ranchi’s Birsa Munda international airport getting cancelled because of low occupancy. On Monday, at least four morning flights to Bangalore, Kolkata and Delhi were suspended as there were no passengers. Two days ago, an Air India flight to Delhi reportedly flew back with no passengers because of the lockdown in the national capital. Talking to TOI, Birsa Munda airport director Vinod Kumar Sharma said, “We got information that four flights -- two of Go Air to Bangalore and Delhi, one Air Asia flight to Delhi and Indigo’s flight to Kolkata -- had to be cancelled today. We don’t know the exact reason why the airlines have cancelled the flights in the morning, but understandably, the reasons are related to the pandemic and the surge in cases, which impacted the occupancy." He also said of the 40-42 to and fro flights operating from the city, about 10 of them are cancelled. “On an average, 30-32 to and fro flights are currently operational. With the lockdown announced in Bangalore and places like Delhi and Mumbai battling the massive number of Covid cases, we anticipate a further dip in the number of outbound passengers. It’s only natural,” Sharma said. Unlike in the first phase of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, the Union government has not suspended air, road and rail transport so far. Jharkhand, which is battling a deadly second wave, is currently observing a weeklong lockdown since April 22 but has not put curbs on the transport sector to prevent the crisis of migrant workers' travel. The general public is, however, refraining from venturing out of the state voluntarily. Raj Kumar Gupta, a city-based banker who was scheduled to visit Kolkata for a family affair on April 30, has now cancelled his flight tickets fearing the infection. “Not just Jharkhand but almost all states are affected by the virus. Considering the medical emergency everywhere, we have now cancelled the ticket even though we incurred losses due to the high cancellation charges,” Gupta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cov-surge-forces-cancellation-of-flights-from-ranchi/articleshow/82264173.cms||ASRP Mukesh

JUT, which has 72 affiliated institutions related to engineering and technology, management and pharmacy, stated that as part of the assessments, students will be given 24 hours to submit their assignments via email, WhatsApp and other platforms. JUT’s academic council met on Monday where the members agreed that an online assignment-based assessment was the only way forward under the prevailing situation. Vice-chancellor P K Mishra said, “We have to go for the new method to ensure utmost safety of students, teachers and other staff members. We are already lagging behind by one semester compared to other universities in the country. We plan to come at par with them by August in the diploma courses. ” According to its plan, the fifth semester assessment examinations for B Tech course will commence from April 30 while assessments of B Tech third semester and B Tech first semester would be held from May 1 and May 15, respectively. The fifth semester assessment for diploma in engineering would start from April 30, third semester from May 10 and first semester would begin from May 15. The JUT has formed an apex committee, headed by Vijay Pandey of BIT Sindri, at the university-level regarding the assessments. Each college has been asked to appoint a nodal officer who would act as a centre in-charge and ensure smooth conduct of the assessment. In case of any difficulty, the nodal officers would take the help of apex committee. During the assessment, a few staff members would be present in their respective institutions to coordinate the process. The colleges have been asked to ensure that all the safety guidelines related to Covid are complied with.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jkhand-tech-varsity-to-hold-semester-assessment-online/articleshow/82263880.cms||Sanjay Sahay

Patients from rural parts are finding it difficult to shift to city for treatment. The unavailability of oxygen had led to death of four patients at a Covid care centre at Kandri last week. It’s learnt, yet another patient passed away on way to Nagpur. Thakare is also on the verge of roping in the Western Coalfields Limited (WCL), through its corporate social responsibility (CSR), to set up oxygen separation units at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital and AIIMS. At least 400 beds would benefit at each of these places through this initiative. Apart from Nagpur, WCL is also likely to extend support to government hospital in Chandrapur. The spiralling Covid spike in the district, having around 14,768 patients at different institutional facilities, was aggravated by the shortfall of oxygen with demand bein way more than the production and outsourcing. The city’s government hospitals and other Covid facilities are getting an erratic supply of oxygen. Hospitals in the rural parts are learnt to be reeling under severe crisis of oxygen forcing the patients to shift to city where hospitals are already saturated. Collector Thakare said the oxygen concentrators would be allotted to the key government Covid hospitals in the city but they would primarily be sent to equip facilities in rural areas. “The oxygen concentrators are expected to reach us in next two weeks. We aim to strengthen the rural health infrastructure to with some provision for the oxygen concentrators,” he said. The collector said the concentrators would be purchased through District Planning and Development Council (DPDC) and from other budgetary provisions for Covid. “The concentrators can at least stabilize the patients at the different rural hospitals, primary health care centres, Covid care centres and such facilities which have been opened at different taluka places,” said Thakare. Apart from Thakare, initiatives have also been taken by individuals like transporter Pyare Khan who has ordered 116 oxygen concentrators for around Rs50 lakh. In the meantime, GMCH got around 20 tonne liquid oxygen from Raipur on Monday. In another positive development, around 55 tonne has arrived from Bhilai. Around 10 tonne was also sent to Gondia and another 15 tonne to Chandrapur from another air-separation unit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/collector-procuring-1000-oxygen-concentrators-for-govt-covid-facilities/articleshow/82264756.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||India||Govt calls critical article in Murdoch paper ‘malicious, slanderous’||NEW DELHI: The Indian government on Monday issued a sharp rejoinder to Rupert Murdoch-owned ‘The Australian’ for an article headlined “Modi leads India into viral apocalypse”, calling it “baseless, malicious and slanderous… written only with the sole objective of undermining the universally acclaimed approach taken by the government of India…at this decisive moment.” The article originally appeared in The Times of London, also a Murdoch paper, and was reproduced in The Australian. They are among the global media magnate’s three main newspapers, along with The Wall Street Journal. The letter, sent by the deputy high commissioner of India in Canberra, accused the paper of not “bothering to check the facts of the case with any of the authorities in the government”. P S Karthigeyan, after detailing the measures taken by the Modi government “starting with the longest and strictest lockdown in the world to the largest and fastest vaccination drive”, went on to describe India’s “much acclaimed Vaccine Maitri initiative to send 66 million vaccines to 80 countries and also to supply medicines and PPEs to 150 countries” which “probably saved hundred (sic) of millions more around the world.” “While our scientific community is still looking at possible reasons for the sudden surge in infections, including the role of infectious new strains that came from outside India, the article has strangely rushed to blame the surge on the restricted election campaign by the Hon’ble Prime Minister and one religious gathering,” the letter said. The Times-Australian article said the warnings of “public health experts… fell on deaf ears as Modi and his acolytes preached a message of triumphalism and exceptionalism. India had 'defeated' the virus, Modi told the World Economic Forum…Just last month, even as infections surged, Harsh Vardhan, the health minister, assured Indians that the country was ‘in the endgame’ of the pandemic. He lauded Modi as a ‘vaccine guru’ and ‘example to the world’.” “Even as death and despair stalked the nation, Modi and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party rejected lockdown and forged ahead with mass gatherings. …The election rallies and Kumbh Mela festival turned out to be super-spreader events — as public health experts had warned,” the article said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-calls-critical-article-in-murdoch-paper-malicious-slanderous/articleshow/82267060.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Daunting task for healthcare workers as many infected in second wave||NAGPUR: Covid hospitals, testing and vaccination centres are facing a big challenge amid the surge in daily cases. The workload has increased with many doctors and healthcare workers testing positive. Many doctors who had been able to protect themselves so far have now been infected. Some of them are hospitalized while many are in home isolation with other members of family too testing positive. The severity of infection among the vaccinated healthcare workers (HCWs) is said to be less as compared to other Covid patients requiring hospitalization. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) testing centres are one of the worst hit with doctors and nurses catching the infection. The NMC is running over 40 testing centres where doctors, mainly interns from medical, ayurveda and dental colleges are collecting the swab. Officials said that it is baffling how these HCWs are testing positive despite using PPE kits and taking all protective measures. A top NMC official claimed hardly 10 to 15 HCWs at their centres have tested positive during the second wave so far. “It is just like the previous wave when our doctors and nurses were testing positive,” the officials claimed. TOI has learnt that the staffers at Pachpaoli Covid care centre, where a DCHC too has been started, have tested positive. Similar is the case of NMC centre at Regional Police Training School (RPTS) and a couple of centres in Mangalwari and Ashi Nagar zones. Staff at RPTS complained that more number of doctors and nurses have tested positive after the facility was shifted to the RTPTS hostel waiting hall. Earlier, the facility was at the hostel and had enough space for physical distancing. “This is not good for citizens as well as staff. Doctors are testing postives within a day or two of joining,” they said. At private hospitals, HCWs are testing positive due to various reasons. Kingsway Hospital’s critical care physician Dr Afzal Sheikh said that at least 20 to 30% staff has tested positive for the first time in the second wave. “Despite meticulous precaution, they got infected. This is because the mutant strain is very infectious and a little lapse in precaution is proving costly,” he said. Dr Sadashiv Bhole, one of the directors of Seven Star Hospital, said around 40% of their staff and their families have been hit by Covid so far. “As per our investigation, most of them didn’t have hospital acquired infection. It has been found that someone in their family tested positive and later they too got infected,” he said. Dr Bhole claimed that the staff members adopt highest safety measures in hospital but at home they prefer to stay relaxed. “75 to 80% risk is outside hospitals. We had insured everyone and taking care of all our staff including their families,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/daunting-task-for-hcws-as-many-infected-in-second-wave/articleshow/82264784.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Inspector (Riverfront west) V M Desai, who is the complainant in the case, said that he received a message on April 15 that two bodies had been spotted in the river. He said that the victim Sunita Datania and her son Anshu were dead when they were fished out of the river. “Sunita’s husband said that she had secured Anshu to her by tying a dupatta around her waist before jumping into the river,” said Desai. Based on Deepak’s statement, the police registered a murder case against Sunita. Sunita’s grandmother Savita told police, “This was Sunita’s second marriage. She married for love. However, she got to know that Deepak not only had an illicit relation with his sister-in-law but also with another girl in the area. This led to a fight between the two. Deepak assaulted Sunita following which she left the house with Anshu on April 12, only to be found dead on April 15.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/she-killed-son-self-murder-case-filed/articleshow/82267080.cms||---
---||Nagpur||6.5k Remdesivir given out, pharma companies fail to deliver full quota||NAGPUR: After two days of acute crisis, around 6,597 vials of anti-viral Remdesivir injections were distributed among Covid hospitals and other facilities in the district on Monday. No injections had arrived in the city on Sunday leading to a panic. The 1,300 that was released by the district administration was received on Saturday. According to a top source in Mumbai, the pharmaceutical companies, which manufactures Remdesivir, are not supplying the injection as per the purchase orders. The erratic supply of Remdesivir leading to a statewide shortfall was due to the inadequate supply of the injections in the state despite a high court order. Even after the Centre had announced an increased allotment of Remdesivir to Maharashtra, it has so far remained only on paper, the source stated. It’s learnt a pharmaceutical company, which had promised to send 55,000 vials to the state, could not supply any consignment in the last five days. Another top pharmaceutical brand, which had assured to send around 23,000 vials, could send only 2,000 in the last few days. In a similar manner, another prominent pharmaceutical company, which had promised around 1.27 lakhs vials, could send only 13,000 in last several days. “The top pharmaceutical companies have faltered on their promise pushing Maharashtra into the crisis situation. The state’s purchase order is pending for the last two months with the pharmaceutical companies which have not complied till date with the full required stock,” said a key source. As per another source in the pharmaceutical sector, the manufacturers too are plagued with several problems including shortage of raw materials which comes from outside India. “The production has slowed down due to manpower infected with Covid. Plus, there is also a simultaneous rise in demand from other states too,” he said. Senior physician Dr Jay Deshmukh said Remdesivir is not a life-saving drug and neither can it stop one from going to ventilator and such critical care. “Remdesivir at the most can stop the infection spread and reduce the hospital stay,” said Deshmukh who said steroids and oral tablets like Favipiravir too are giving sound results. According to Hetal Thakkar of Nagpur District Chemists and Druggists Association, hospitals and other Covid facilities should stop sending patients’ kin for trying to buy Remdisivir in the open market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/6-5k-rem-given-out-pharma-cos-fail-to-deliver-full-quota/articleshow/82264810.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||Rescheduled MBBS exams from June 1st week: Minister Deshmukh||NAGPUR: Medical education minister Amit Deshmukh on Monday said the MBBS undergraduate exams, deferred earlier this month, would be rescheduled from June first week. During his visit to the city, he stressed on the need for more doctors and healthcare workers catering to the growing number of Covid-19 patients. He also directed officials to fill up all vacant posts of healthcare workers in the division immediately. “The second wave in Maharashtra is four times bigger than the first one. It is obvious that all healthcare facilities are full. MVA government is making all out efforts to fight this pandemic by opening jumbo Covid centres, Covid care centres, institutional isolation centres and also encouraging mild patients for home isolation,” he said. Elaborating on the ongoing lockdown, the minister said it had started showing effects with 15 districts showing more recoveries than new cases. “All constituents of the MVA government are unitedly fighting the pandemic. We have been continuously adding more oxygenated beds and ventilators and also increasing beds in private hospitals. Slowly, the situation is improving,” he added. Explaining the vaccination drive, Deshmukh said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray would soon take a decision to procure vaccines from the entire world so that maximum number of citizens could be inoculated in shortest possible time. “The United States is sending its surplus vaccines and raw material to India. Maharashtra would be at the forefront in the vaccination drive,” he said. After holding a review meeting with guardian minister Nitin Raut, GMCH and IGGHMCH deans in presence of MLA Vikas Thakre and MLC Abhijit Wanjari, the minister said Nagpur was on the path of recovery. “Remdesivir injections would be provided to serious patients and there would be no shortage. The work on starting an oxygen plant should be expedited with the grant from the collector. In view of the growing number of patients, new administrative officers and nursing staff for colleges and hospitals will be recruited soon,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rescheduled-mbbs-exams-from-june-1st-week-min-deshmukh/articleshow/82264815.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

A 22-year-old woman, a Sola resident, nailed her harasser on Sunday by photographing his car’s licence plate. The presence of mind of the woman, a customer care executive, helped police nab the culprit, Hiren Patel. On Sunday evening, the woman and her sister had gone to a dairy to buy milk. While the two were returning to their residence, Patel made obscene gestures at them from his car. Initially, the woman thought that the man was perhaps known to them. But soon, they realized he was some random harasser. When Patel drew close to the woman, he lowered the car window and told her that she looked ‘hot’. He made more objectionable comments and drove away. The woman took pictures of the licence plate at that stage. In her complaint filed with the Sola High Court police station, the woman said that she and her sister later spotted the car near ICB Flora Apartments in the area. The woman said she looked at the pictures in her cellphone and confirmed that the car belonged to the harasser. The woman called her brother, who reached the spot swiftly. The three then waited for the man and as he approached the car, the three confronted him. The police control room was informed. The inspector of Sola High Court police, J P Jadeja, said that the man has been booked under the Indian Penal Code’s Section 354A (1) (IV) for uttering sexually coloured words, which makes him liable to be charged with sexual harassment. Section 354 D (stalking) has been invoked as well. The man lives in the apartment complex near which the three caught him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sola-woman-shoots-harasser-with-phone/articleshow/82267082.cms||---

---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: People turn to social media platforms for Covid needs & emotional support||VISAKHAPATNAM: Social media platforms have almost emerged as lifesavers amid the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. These platforms have not only helped people access knowledge and resources, but have also provided emotional succour to people suffering from the disease and to those who have lost a loved one to the pandemic. With smartphones allowed in hospitals, hospitalised Covid-19 patients are communicating regularly with their friends and family. Families on the other hand are using the same social media platforms to access networks of plasma donors, medicine and food. Koduru Sumana, a classical dancer who recently recovered from severe Covid-19 at a private hospital in Tirupati, said, “My husband and I were infected with Covid-19. Unfortunately, my husband passed away. I recovered with the support of my friends while speaking with them on social media. They supported and motivated be continuously and made me mentally strong.” Some social media platforms have played a key role in connecting plasma seekers to donors, says P Jagan Mohana Rao, vice-chairman of Indian Red Cross Society for Andhra Pradesh. Dr KV Ram Kumar, managing director of Lakshmi Gayatri Hospital in Visakhapatnam, said that he is currently treating mild Covid-19 cases and other illnesses through video calls. A group of doctors in Vizianagaram has opened an isolation treatment package for patients. “We receive requests through WhatsApp from people in home isolation. We have a seven-day package which includes daily home visits by doctors,” said one of the doctors associated with the group. Dr PV Sudhakar, Covid-19 nodal officer and principal of Andhra Medical College, said that he is conducting video conferences with the medical fraternity every day. “On Monday, we conducted a webinar on oxygen therapy for Covid-19 hospitals across the state. These social media platforms have really emerged as lifesavers for stakeholders and Covid warriors,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/people-turn-to-social-media-platforms-for-covid-needs-emotional-support/articleshow/82263388.cms||V Kamalakara Rao

While Congress won only two wards, four independents made it to the new council. The panel fielded by NCP state president Jose Philip D’Souza could not even open its account. While a few experienced councillors lost the battle, candidates backed by politician godfathers made it to the new MMC council. Urban development minister and Mormugao MLA Milind Naik had fielded nine candidates — wards 1-9 — against Mormugao Warriors, a panel fielded by vice president of Goa Pradesh Congress Committee Sankalp Amonkar. Seven of Naik’s candidates — wards 1-7 — won, while only two of Amonkar’s candidates, including his wife Shraddha, made it to the council. MMC’s jurisdiction includes areas of three assembly constituencies — Mormugao (9 wards), Vasco (12 wards) and Dabolim (4 wards). Of the 11 candidates fielded by Vasco MLA Carlos Almeida, nine won. In his Vasco constituency, two independents fielded by Krishna alias Daji Salkar, Almeida’s opponent, won. This included Salkar’s wife, Shammi. In the four wards of the Dabolim constituency where BJP MLA Mauvin Godinho had fielded candidates, three won. The remaining one seat each in Vasco and Dabolim were won by independents. Both are close aides of Naik. Few of the new faces in the municipality are spouses—Salkar’s wife Shammi, Rochna Borkar’s husband Girish, Dhanpal Swamy’s wife Swami, and ex-chairperson Nandadeep Raut’s wife Priya. Journalist-turned-politician, who resigned from an English daily to contest the polls, Sudesh Bhosle, won in ward 22. He was backed by Godinho. Ex- councillors like Damodar Kaskar, Deepak Naik, Fredrick Henriques, Shraddha Amonkar, Yatin Kamurlekar and Leo Rordrigues made it to the new panel yet again. Former minority chairman of Congress, Saifulla Khan, who was a councillor for the past 15 years, lost to Deepak Naik in ward 12.

Arrivals are usually about 12,000-13,000 bales per day during a normal season,” said Arun Dalal, a city-based cotton broker. According to market players, 95% of ginning mills are closed. In addition, many agriculture produce market committees (APMCs) or mandis also are also shut due to the spurt in Covid-19 cases in the state. Further, farmers are also not venturing out for fear of catching the infection. All this has resulted in a drop in arrival of cotton. Not just Gujarat, cotton arrival across the country has declined to 15,000 to 20,000 bales per day compared to 45,000-50,000 bales in April in a normal season. Prices, however, have remained firmed at Rs 44,000 to Rs 45,000 per candy (ginned cotton), market players said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cotton-arrival-dips-as-covid-19-surges/articleshow/82267087.cms||---

Traders attribute this price rise due to the decline in availability owing to rising temperatures. Popular varieties of freshwater fish such as Koramenu (red snapper) and Matta Gidasa are selling for Rs 700 and Rs 400 a kilo respectively. Only a couple of weeks back, Koramenu was selling for Rs 500 a kilo while Matta Gidasa went for Rs 250 a kilo. Other freshwater fish such as Catla, Rohu, Mrugala and Rup Chand are selling between Rs 150 and Rs 300 per kilo. Ch Satyanarayana Murthy, president of Dolphin Boat Operators’ Welfare Association, said that the annual deep-sea fishing ban has triggered the price rise of freshwater fish. Fishing activities at Visakhapatnam harbour have come to a standstill, he said. In restaurants too, seafood delicacies have seen prices shoot through the roof due to a shortage of stock. “Restaurants are not serving seafood dishes during the ban. We hope for the situation to improve in the last week of June,” said Akella Venkata Ramana Murthy, president of Andhra Pradesh Hotels Association (APHA). Meanwhile, chicken prices have come down significantly from Rs 220 per kg to Rs 160 per kg. Chicken-sellers say that consumption of chicken has decreased dramatically during the summer resulting in a decrease in chicken prices. The broiler chicken business is good only on Sundays, but very low on other days, say traders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/annual-sea-fishing-ban-triggers-rise-in-price-of-freshwater-fish/articleshow/82263397.cms||Nalla.Babu

He said that laptops should be distributed on January 9 to those who opted under Amma Vodi scheme. The government has given option to the students of class 9-12 to give either cash incentive or laptop. The CM said that warranty card and other certifications should be provided to students along with laptops to ensure good service of the laptops.

The Gujarat Rajya Shala Sanchalak Mahamandal, an association of managements and trustees of private schools in the state, has urged the government to start the next academic session in June if the situation has improved. In their letter to the chief minister, the association stated the government should announce the summer vacation from May 1 to June 6. The state government has decided to postpone the Class X and XII board exams due to the worsening Covid-19 situation in the state. It also announced recently that students of Classes I to IX and XI, will be given mass promotions for the academic year 2020-21 without annual examinations. Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) had earlier set the dates for Classes X and XII from May 10 and May 25, respectively.

---||India||Keep patient data secret, Congress tells its helplines||NEW DELHI: In a first of sorts for a political party, Congress has issued strict instructions on data confidentiality of patients in Covid relief work that it has decided to take to the smallest level by asking all the district units to set up control rooms and helplines. In its directives, Congress has said data relating to patients collected through helplines should not be divulged. As per the letter send by party general secretary K C Venugopal, “The data should be confidential and shall not be transmitted or used in any form with any other agencies, organisations or individuals until authorised by concerned office bearers.” Well-placed party sources said the novel emphasis on privacy is on account of the fact that patients would be revealing their mobile phones numbers, addresses and health details to volunteers of a political outfit. While such data, even in general course, should be divulged only by the person concerned, the pandemic is throwing up new concerns. Vendors of Covid-related equipment, as is evident from social media, are badgering potential patients with offers, and the situation can turn “insensitive” if they get details about needs of people and their contact numbers. As a result, Congress has directed that while nine people in a district control room will man the helpline, one person will be dedicated to manage the data. Importantly, the party is issuing Google Forms to all districts and state units into which the data will be filed, and they will be password protected. The idea to set up principal control rooms at district levels is a shift from the earlier plan to have them at state level, with the party realising that the severity of the pandemic has turned all relief hyper-local. Presently, besides Youth Congress, individual members have set up relief teams, like the network erected by MP Deepender Hooda in Haryana. Congress has asked the district units to mobilise as many doctors as possible to contribute with voluntary consultancy work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/keep-patient-data-secret-congress-tells-its-helplines/articleshow/82267085.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

Snapshots from 2021 depicting bustling markets turned deserted; buses parked at the depots and roads with barely a soul in sight and screeching silence along the main roads by 9pm, which are otherwise bustling with traffic, make for a few stark reminders from last year! Even though there is no lockdown in Ahmedabad, self-lockdown imposed by various traders, jewellers and market associations along with crowd-control measures including restricted movement at cinema halls, multiplexes and malls, imposing of night curfew along with closure of tea stalls, paan shops and recently, even salons, have further left the city’s public places isolated. On Monday, teams of solid waste management department of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) shut barber shops and salons across the city for alleged violation of social distancing norms,according to top AMC sources. Teams of solid waste management department in Ahmedabad took to crowd-control measures at various places in the city. Some1,504 salons and beauty parlours, barber shops and salons were shut across Ahmedabad on Monday. Two weeks ago, similar measures were also taken by force-shutting paan shops and tea stalls across Ahmedabad. “These are places where crowds gather and at a time when the spread of Covid-19 is sohigh, maintaining social distance is crucial. These shops have been shut to ensure crowds don’t gather,” said a source from AMC. Last week, traders at Madhupura market, cloth traders at Panchkuva and New Cloth Market, travel and trade association members metal traders at Mandvi ni Pol and jewellers at Manek Chowk, Ratanpole in other parts of Ahmedabad, observed a self-imposed shutdown either for a weekend, or two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/locked-down-sans-a-lockdown/articleshow/82267097.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa: Kavlekar wins control of Quepem civic body again||MARGAO: Deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar once again succeeded in retaining his hold over the 13-member Quepem Municipal Council (QMC). Nine candidates backed by him won the civic polls. Congress, which had descended into the polls in Quepem determined to wrest control of the civic body, had to be content with just three seats. The tally of the Congress-backed panel United for Quepem rose to four after an independent extended his support to the party. Congress president Girish Chodankar along with local party functionaries had extensively campaigned for the party’s candidates in Quepem. The results, however, proved Kavlekar’s growing dominion over the Quepem municipal area, immaterial of his party affiliation. Kavlekar had led 10 Congress MLAs in switching over to the BJP in 2019. Outgoing chairperson of QMC Dayesh Naik, who faced a three-cornered contest in ward 7, emerged victorious, while outgoing vice chairperson Chetan Haldankar, who was locked in a four-cornered battle in ward 1, also won. Both were backed by Kavlekar. Significantly, both were headed for an unopposed win last month before court intervention over the reservation issue led to rescheduling of the polls to April 23. In a major upset, former chairperson of QMC Manuel Colaco, who was seeking to return to the council for the seventh term, was defeated by former chairperson Amol Kanekar, who contested as an independent, but was backed by Kavlekar. In ward 11, Arlinda Lacerda, a new face fielded by the Congress-backed panel, defeated ex-councillor Caetaninha Pires, who was backed by Kavlekar. Kavlekar-backed Prasad Phal Dessai won by a narrow margin of 9 votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kavlekar-wins-control-of-quepem-civic-body-again/articleshow/82265691.cms||Govind Kamat Maad
---||Vijayawada||BJP challenges validity of Tirupati by-election in HC||Vijayawada: The BJP on Monday moved the AP high court challenging the validity of the just-concluded Tirupati by-election to Lok Sabha. K Ratna Prabha, who contested the bypoll as a BJP candidate, filed the petition alleging booth capturing and large-scale fraudulent practices by the ruling party in the state during the election. She sought directions to declare the polling as void, stating that the evidence in support of her claim was overwhelming. Ratna Prabha argued in her petition that the ruling party, with active connivance of the police, brought people from other places with fake identity cards, which were created in the name of genuine voters. She alleged that the police helped these fake voters to enter various polling booths to cast votes in the guise of genuine voters. To buttress her claims, she also submitted videos in which the alleged fake voters were seen fleeing from the polling booths when asked about their address and names of parents. She further said that there were numerous such instances, which were also widely reported in the media, about thousands of fake voters being brought in hired buses which is akin to booth capturing as the election officials did not allow genuine voters, saying their votes have already been cast. Ratna Prabha alleged that the Chittoor collector failed to act against fraudulent practices employed by the ruling dispensation. Even after submitting all evidence about the organised booth capturing, he did not act in the first place and did not even send a report to the election commission. The representations submitted to the election commission did not elicit any response and the only remedy left for her was to invoke the jurisdiction of the high court, she said. As the by-election was not conducted in a free and fair manner, it is liable to be declared as void or countermanded, she added, citing various Supreme Court judgments in her defence. The petition was listed before Justice U Durga Prasad Rao on Monday. However, according to writ rules, any election-related petition needs to be listed before a division bench. The counsel for Ratna Prabha and advocate general S Sriram submitted to the court that the petition was wrongly listed before a single judge instead of a division bench. Justice Durga Prasad Rao directed the registry to list the matter before an appropriate bench. The TDP has also moved a separate petition with the same pleadings to countermand the Tirupati by-election.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/bjp-challenges-validity-of-tirupati-by-election-in-hc/articleshow/82263423.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Goa||In Sanguem, BJP walks away with six of 10 seats||MARGAO: BJP succeeded in getting the Sanguem Municipal Council under its belt after six candidates backed by its former MLA Subhash Phal Dessai emerged triumphant in the civic polls in the 10-member municipal body. Two of the victorious candidates were backed by independent Sanguem MLA Prasad Gaonkar, while one was backed by Savitri, wife of deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar. Sangameshwar Naik, the sole independent candidate, who won the polls, said he is yet undecided on whom to extend his support. The victory for BJP has added some political muscle into the Phal Dessai camp as this will now enable the former MLA to stake claim for the BJP ticket from Sanguem constituency for the 2022 assembly elections. Savitri Kavlekar, who was then in the Congress camp along with her spouse, had contested against Phal Dessai in the 2017 assembly elections, but lost. Gaonkar, who had won in the triangular contest, had initially backed the BJP-led government only to withdrew his support mid-way. “Our candidates enjoyed the support of all sections of the society. Even minorities voted for our candidates. We will strive to provide a corruption-free and efficient civic administration,” Phal Dessai told reporters. Among the major upsets was in ward 6 where Sanjay (Abuli) Raikar, who was contesting for the eighth consecutive term, was defeated by former councillor Fouzia Shaikh. Shaikh had moved the court over the reservation issue after this ward was reserved for OBC. As the polls were rescheduled, the ward was kept open for general category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-sanguem-bjp-walks-away-with-six-of-10-seats/articleshow/82265708.cms||---

Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar told TOI, “We have received guidelines from the government for vaccination of people in above 18 age-group. Government has allowed CVC at industrial establishments in which industries and companies can directly register its dispensary. In case there is no dispensary, the establishments can register for the centre in a tie-up with a private hospital running CVC,” he said. Dr Chilkar said that though NMC will facilitate as much as CVCs as possible in the city, more centres in industries and companies for their employees and family members will help in inoculation of more people in lesser time. “It will also prevent their employees from travelling to CVCs in NMC, government and private hospitals,” he said. Welcoming the government’s move, managing director (emerging business) of SMS Limited Amit Somani told TOI that they are eager to set up CVC at their establishment, sponsor and vaccinate its 500-strong staff in the city. “The decision will also reduce burden on government centres. But we are worried about availability of doses considering the current situation. Let us hope the government has some plan and will provide sufficient quantity of doses to all,” he said. Head of administration of Dhariwal Infrastructure and Power Limited, Chandrapur, Sandip Mukherjee said, “We will be soon submitting a letter to the collector office seeking CVC at plant for vaccination of around 700 employees. We had to take our employees aged above 45 years to the nearest public health for inoculation. It will become easier now with CVC likely to be approved at out plant.” Mukherjee claimed that they are doing various types of CSR activities in nearby villages since construction of the plant. “We can also plan vaccination under CSR for others subjects as per our capacity, provided there is all help from collector office,” he said. Head of administration of InfoCepts, Sunil Narware, said, “It is a good move. We are reading database of our 700 employees and their immediate family members. We are ready to set up the infrastructure at our campus in the IT Park. We hope to complete vaccination of around 1,400 between May 1 and 7.” The government had rolled out vaccination for healthcare workers (HCW) from January 16 followed by frontline workers (FLW) from February 5. In initial days, CVCs were allowed only in government hospitals which were extended later to private hospitals. After allowing inoculation of 65-plus and 45-plus with comorbidities on March 1, the government relaxed norms and also permitted CVCs in PHCs. With opening up of vaccination for all above 45 years, few civic bodies like NMC started inoculation at satellite centres in indoor sports stadiums, community halls etc. It will be for the first time CVC will be allowed at industries and corporate companies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/industries-corporates-keen-to-start-vax-centres-inoculate-staff/articleshow/82264927.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

In the interview, aired by the London-based Iran International Persian-language satellite news channel late on Sunday, Zarif said he had “zero” influence over Iran’s foreign policy. Without disputing the audio’s authenticity, the foreign ministry spokesman on Monday said that the news channel only published excerpts of the interview with the minister. Using language rarely heard in politics in Iran, Zarif complained about the influence the late IRGC commander Qassim Suleimani had over foreign policy, hinting that he tried to spoil Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal by colluding with Russia. “He (Suleimani) asked me to make this or that concession or point almost every time I went to negotiate (with world powers),” Zarif said in the recording. Suleimani was killed in a US drone attack in Iraq last year. Iran retaliated with a rocket attack on an Iraqi air base where US forces were stationed. Hours later, Iranian forces shot down a Ukrainian passenger airliner in Tehran. Days later, Iran’s Guards admitted that the plane had been shot “mistakenly”. “I said (at the Supreme National Security meeting) that if the plane was really hit with missiles, tell us so we can see how we can fix it. They told me ‘no, go, go tweet and deny it’,” Zarif said in the recording.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/in-leaked-audio-irans-zarif-criticises-guards-influence-on-diplomacy/articleshow/82267090.cms||---

Narendra Kumar, along with P Gopala Krishnan who is another accused in the case, moved a separate petition challenging the judicial remand order of the VII additional district judge in Vijayawada and sought bail from the court. The ACB arrested Narendra Kumar and Gopala Krishnan on charges of misappropriating government land by creating a false certificate. It was also alleged that the land is being used to run a private hospital, causing loss to the government and pecuniary gain to Narendra Kumar. Narendra Kumar argued in his petition that the transfer of land was done according to norms and there was no procedural or legal violation. He contended that none of the penal sections under which the case has been registered against him are tenable and alleged that the case was registered with political motives. He further stated that the VII additional district court judge did not consider facts that the case was booked under revoked sections of Prevention of Corruption Act while sending them in judicial remand. He sought interim relief by way of granting bail pending disposal of the main petition. The high court is yet to take up the matter for hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/dhulipalla-moves-hc-seeks-bail/articleshow/82263453.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Under the banner of PVS Helping Hands Charitable Trust, the youngsters have started delivering food a few days ago. The trust is headed by newly-elected YSRC corporator from ward number 60 PV Suresh. Involved in many social programmes, the trust has now come forward to help Covid-19 patients in the industrial zone of the city. “We have started this initiative for the industrial zone only, but we are getting calls from other parts of the city as well. We are confined to the seven wards in the industrial zone including Sriharipuram, Malkapuram, Gajuwaka and surrounding areas,” corporator PV Suresh told TOI. The city’s industrial zone has a population of 5–6 lakh. Most of them work in adjoining industries. Many among them are migrants from various parts of the country. “They stay here either alone or with their immediate family and have no relatives here. So, it’s difficult for them to get food,” said Anil, one of the volunteers. The trust has announced mobile numbers of volunteers for each area and are requesting people to inform them well in advance so that it can arrange the food. The trust is providing both lunch and dinner. “We are providing both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food along with fruits. For lunch, we need to be informed by 10am and for dinner by 4pm,” Suresh said, while adding that the trust is receiving 30–40 phone calls a day. Volunteers of the trust put the food parcels at the doorsteps of Covid patients. Well-known in the city, the PVS Helping Hands Charitable Trust has been collecting record units of blood every Republic Day. It donated a record 888 units of blood on Republic Day this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vizag-youths-serve-food-to-covid-ill-in-home-isolation/articleshow/82263485.cms||Siva G

However, a late-night PTI report said that Sichuan Airlines was working on a new plan to resume services. The Chinese ambassador to India later tweeted that China stood firmly with India and it would “encourage and guide Chinese companies to actively participate in facilitating various needed medical supplies for India”. Official sources on Monday said India was expecting medical supplies, including oxygen concentrators, ventilators and medicines, from the US, UK, Russia, France, Australia, Gulf and commercially from China. More than 300 concentrators arrived from the US on Monday even though they were not directly procured by the government. The government had earlier identified private suppliers in China of similar equipment. For reasons not clear until late on Monday, the Chinese embassy in Sri Lanka tweeted that 10,000 concentrators were likely to be flown into India from Hong Kong this week. There was no confirmation or denial of this by the foreign ministry. India’s Spice-Express had airlifted 800 concentrators from Hong Kong to India on Sunday. According to PTI, a logistics arm under Sichuan Airlines said that it was discussing a new plan to resume cargo services to India, as the country has been going through a Covid-19 resurgence. The response came after Indian media reported that Sichuan Airlines had suspended all its cargo flights to India and said such a move brings “major disruption” to private traders' efforts to buy medical supplies from China. “We are re-evaluating the original plan of suspending cargo services to India, and actively discussing a new plan to guarantee cargo services to the region,” a Global Times report quoted the airlines as saying in reply to its queries. A Chinese spokesperson said in Beijing that the two countries were in touch over issues related to the pandemic. “We stand ready to offer support and assistance to the best of our capability if the Indian side informs us of its specific needs. As for the operation of specific flights of the airlines you mentioned, I suggest you check with the company concerned,” the spokesperson said in response to a media query.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/china-halts-cargo-flights-but-ready-to-help/articleshow/82267100.cms||---

Indian film editors still consider it among the best edited shots of Hindi film to date. The man behind the scene’s master editing, Waman Bhonsle, passed away at his home in Mumbai on Monday morning. A Goan, hailing from Pomburpa, Bhonsle died of old-age related ailments at the age of 87 and was cremated soon after, his nephew and filmmaker Dinesh Bhonsle told TOI. From the late 1960s to late 1990s, for over nearly three decades, Bhonsle worked with the topmost filmmakers of the Hindi industry from Raj Khosla to Gulzar and Subhash Ghai to Shekar Kapur. In 1978, he won the national award for best editing for the film ‘Inkaar’, in the very first year that the award was instituted. But the journey for Bhonsle from rural Goa to the position of top editor of the Hindi film industry was not easy. “Pomburpa is a small village and we did not have the best facilities available for education. I had to walk 8km to 10km a day to get to school. So I came to Mumbai in 1952 (barely a teenager) in the hope of making a good living for myself. I started out doing odd jobs,” Bhonsle told an interviewer once. D N Pai took the youngster under his wings and Bhonsle considered him his guru till the end. It was after 14 years of struggle that Bhonsle landed his first independent film editing job for ‘Do Raaste’ in 1967. “The film was an instant hit and all the producers then lined up to work with me,” Bhonsle once recounted. He counted Mera Gaon Mera Desh, Ram Lakhan, Saudagar among some of his best work, though admitting that the choice was a tough one. “When Manguesh Dessai worked on the sound, I learnt a lot from him. Many would say, but you are senior. But I told them no body is a big man, whoever does good work is a big man, senior,” Bhonsle once said. Through his long years of work, Bhonsle kept pace with the changing technology in his editing, leaving fellow and much young lot of editors stunned with his work in ‘Ghulam’.In 2002, he retired from the job and Amol Palekar’s Marathi film ‘Kairi’ was his final piece of work. “He passed away at his home in Goregaum. He had not been keeping well for the last one year and his condition only deteriorated since the lockdown, and it worsened in the last seven days. He did manage to visit his village in Goa two months ago and spent 15 days there,” said his nephew. He is survived by his children Vikas Bhonsle, Varsha Palekar, Vaishali Nair and Vibha Kondkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/noted-film-editor-waman-bhonsle-dies-at-87/articleshow/82265740.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||India||EGI expresses concern over ‘inhuman treatment’ of journalist Siddique Kappan||NEW DELHI: The Editors Guild of India, Press Club of India and Indian Women’s Press Corps joined forces to express concern over what they called inhuman treatment being meted out to Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan, who has been in custody in UP since October last year, and who has now tested positive for Covid-19. In a statement on Monday, the Editors Guild demanded a fair trial for Kappan and said it was “deeply disturbed” by allegations by his wife that Kappan was “tied to a bed and is neither able to take food nor access toilet, while undergoing treatment at a Mathura hospital for Covid-19”. “This is shocking and should stir the conscience of the nation that a journalist is being treated in this cruel manner and is being denied basic rights,” the Guild said. It also criticised UP CM Adityanath ignoring demands from Kappan’s family and civil society for fair treatment of the journalist. “It is further shocking that the Supreme Court of India has yet not intervened in this case to ensure a fair trial for the journalist, even though the habeas corpus petition challenging his arrest has been pending before the court for the past six months. All of this goes against the basic canons of a constitutional democracy where independent journalistic enterprises need to be protected rather than repressed,” the EGI said. The Press Club of India and the IWPC urged the SC to take up Kappan’s case urgently and ensure that he is treated humanely. The EGI also lamented the UP CM’s threat to “seize the property of anyone who reported on the paucity of oxygen in hospitals in the state”. “Such declamations have a chilling effect on media freedom, at a time when there is urgent need for objective reporting and accountability on the worsening pandemic,” the EGI said. TNN Times View: The annual 2021 report of Reporters Without Borders ranked India 142 out of 180 countries on levels of freedom available to journalists. The harsh treatment being meted out to Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan, under arrest for over six months now, is another stark illustration of why. The journalists’ organisations have rightly said “this is shocking and should stir the conscience of the nation.” We hope it stirs the government to act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/egi-expresses-concern-over-inhuman-treatment-of-journalist-siddique-kappan/articleshow/82267103.cms||---

Taking serious note of the deepening Covid-19 crisis, a division bench of Chief Justice Mohammed Rafiq and Justice Atul Shreedharan took up a bunch of petitions on the issue despite Monday being a holiday. The petitions are regarding alleged concealment of Covid fatalities, scarcity of oxygen and delay in getting test reports. The bench sought a reply from the government on all these issues and scheduled the next hearing for April 28. In one of the petitions, senior advocate from Indore, Anand Mohan Mathur, says that despite the high court order to ensure supply of oxygen, it is not being done. Mathur urged the court to monitor supplies of oxygen and Remdesivir, and alleged that death numbers are being concealed. Senior advocate Naman Nagrath who has been appointed amicus curiae by high court, informed the bench that government was to install oxygen plants in eight districts but has managed to do so in five districts so far. Although it costs Rs 1 crore to set up an oxygen plant, it has not been installed in several districts though districts like Jabalpur earn Rs 2 crore a day from excise alone, he pointed out. Had it been done in every district, then the situation would not have been so critical, he said. He also told the court that Covid-19 is spreading in rural areas, and delay in getting test reports is adding to the spread of infection. Despite court orders, it is nearly taking 36 hours to get test reports, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/madhya-pradesh-hc-seeks-govt-reply-on-covid-death-data/articleshow/82267104.cms||---

Chodankar plans to challenge the order dismissing the disqualification petition either before the high court or the Supreme Court. To do so, he needs a certified copy of the order passed by Patnekar on April 20. Clearly irked with the “delaying tactics”, Chodankar shot off a letter to Patnekar questioning the delay. “Kindly furnish the certified copy of the order immediately, failing which the undersigned would be purposed to challenge the order before the appropriate court, without annexing the copy of the order and also informing the court about the fact that the certified copy has not yet been furnished,” Chodankar said in the letter to the speaker. On April 20, Patnekar dismissed Congress and MGP’s disqualification petitions moved against 12 BJP MLAs. Congress was informed that “certain corrections” were being made to the order. Chodankar was told that he could collect the certified copy on April 22, but was later told that the order was not ready.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/speaker-obstructing-legal-options-cong/articleshow/82265748.cms||---

The wholetime director of HPL, Subhasendu Chatterjee, said that this capacity would be further enhanced in future. He pointed out that Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL) needs substantial quantity of gaseous nitrogen which is catered to by HPL’s captive nitrogen plant owned by Praxair and built on HPL’s land using HPL infrastructure. In the process of producing nitrogen, Praxair also produces 95 tonnes per day of liquid oxygen, which is sold by Praxair for various usages, including for medical purpose. “Thus, HPL in the process of meeting its nitrogen requirement for petrochemical units has been able to generate a substantial quantity of oxygen through Praxair and meet the urgent requirement of medical oxygen in the state,” he said. According to him, the oxygen produced by Praxair can meet a substantial portion of West Bengal’s current oxygen need. “With the proposed refinery unit under active consideration, nitrogen requirement will further go up and HPL will further aid in ramping up the plant capacity to increase production of nitrogen as well as oxygen to meet the increased demand,” he added. In India, oxygen production per day was 56,000-60,000 per day. This includes oxygen for cylinder, pipeline and in liquid form. As per the available data, from 2016-19, the oxygen consumption for medical purposes was 1,600-2,000 tonne per day. “There has been a surge in oxygen demand to 10,000 tonne per day in 2020 though compared to overall capacity of production it was still 20%. Now even if we see a further surge, it should not be alarming. But the real problem would be other infrastructure,” an expert added. Experts suggested that cylinders for medical oxygen are in limited supply coupled with cryogenic tankers for transportation of oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/haldia-petro-to-meet-40-of-states-medical-oxygen-need/articleshow/82264964.cms||---

The 9pm-6am curfew, currently in force, will continue. “We decided to impose the 14-day curfew from 9pm Tuesday till 6am of May 12 after consulting the expert committee as the Covid tally in Bengaluru and surrounding areas has surpassed that of Maharashtra. If the situation is not brought under control in two weeks, it may go out of hand,” said chief minister BS Yediyurappa after a three-hour cabinet meeting. The cabinet also decided to provide Covid-19 vaccination free of cost at government hospitals for the 18-44 age group. Unlike last year’s lockdown, some essential services and industries have been given partial exemption this time. “Essential services will be allowed from 6am to 10am; takeouts from hotels, restaurants, bars, pubs and liquor outlets are allowed. Also allowed is home delivery of food and essentials through ecommerce apps. Construction, agriculture and manufacturing units, barring garments, will be allowed to function with restrictions,” the chief minister said. “The garment industry has not been given permission since 7-8 lakh people work in proximity,’’ an official said. For the next fortnight, the CM said there won’t be any local public transport available in Karnataka. However, inter-state and inter-district travel and movement of goods and essential services have been allowed. People travelling within the state should have valid reasons like attending emergency, funeral. Travel to vax centres, for emergencies allowed with valid ID Government offices — except for those required for emergency works, including health and revenue — will be closed for the duration,” the CM added. Essential service sector workers, people travelling in emergency and those visiting vaccination centres will be allowed to travel after producing valid ID. Sources in the chief minister’s office said the government is planning to ply local buses to help people reach vaccination centres to fast-track the drive from May 1. “Deputy commissioners and tahsildars of districts and taluks have been instructed to take strict action against violators,” the CM said. Last week, the government stopped short of announcing a full-fledged lockdown and preferred night curfews during weekdays and weekend curfew till May 4 keeping in mind the need to keep economic activities going. On free Covid vaccination, the CM said: “The vaccine will be provided free of cost to citizens between 18 and 44 years at government vaccination centres across Karnataka. The Centre’s vaccination drive for citizens above 45 years of age will continue. I urge all eligible to register themselves from April 28,” the CM tweeted. Yediyurappa said the cabinet will write to the state election commission, seeking postponement of local bodies and panchayat elections because of the Covid crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cases-spiral-karnataka-goes-into-14-day-lockdown-from-tonight/articleshow/82267091.cms||---

---||India||Counsellors extend support to children in Covid times||NEW DELHI: From fear of recovering in isolation to seeking help to cope with behavioural issues like aggression, varied concerns affecting children impacted by Covid-19 have been shared over 742 calls with counsellors since September, when a tele-counselling psychological first aid facility was first launched by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR). While the calls over the last two-three months have been fewer and mostly about anxiety around exam schedules, the second wave of cases has brought children’s health and mental well-being back into focus. Called SAMVEDNA (Sensitizing Action on -Mental Health Vulnerability through Emotional Development and Necessary Acceptance) the toll free tele-counselling service — 1800-121-2830 — is serviced by a network of qualified experts, counsellors and psychologists. The facility aims to provide emotional support to children who are in quarantine, isolation or at Covid care centres. Children whose parents or family members are infected and those who have lost their parents to the virus are also a focus group. In the middle of a surge in cases, the NCPCR has now written to the state authorities asking them to re-circulate information about the tele-counselling facility at Covid care centres and isolation facilities and senstise staff, doctors, frontline workers so that children can be guided to seek help from experts on the toll free number. NCPCR chief Priyank Kanoongo has said, “The ongoing wave is hitting all of us badly and unlike last year it is affecting children too. Children may experience a range of pschological issues such as anxiety, fear, depression, difficulty in sleeping and loss of apetite. Quarantine and isolation may also also lead to acute stress disorder, trauma and grief in many children.” The tele-counselling data shows that the impact of the pandemic on the daily education routine and exams has been a major cause of concern among children and their parents. While around October-November callers incuded children directly impacted by Covid, between March 1 to April 15 most of the 76 interventions carried out by counsellors were related to concerns surrounding exam schedules. Later last year children reported varied concerns. In one case a 6-year-old child lodged in isolation at a care centre in Kanpur was exhibiting aggressive behaviour. The counsellors cited this to be a sign of loneliness that the child was experiencing. In another case, a 17-year-old boy in isolation in a care centre in Madhya Pradesh called to said that he was scared about being alone. In another case, a 15-year-old child lodged in isolation at a care centre in Aurangabad shared her frustration of not getting enough love from parents. In this case both, the child and her parents were counselled. Times View: Children living in shelter homes are extremely vulnerable in various ways. In these pandemic times they must be protected, and if need be, given proper treatment and care. NCPCR is right in seeking information on them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/counsellors-extend-support-to-children-in-covid-times/articleshow/82267107.cms||---
---||Chennai||Jabs for 18-45 may hit blood donations in Tamil Nadu||CHENNAI: Voluntary blood donations in the state may take a hit in the coming weeks with the government allowing those in the 18-45 age group to get vaccinated. Since the majority of the voluntary donations are made by those in this age group and one having to wait for 28 days after the second Covid jab to donate, blood banks have appealed to youth to donate it before getting vaccinated. If not enough turn up, road accident victims, cancer patients (for chemotherapy, etc) and people with HIV could suffer as their treatment involves multiple blood transfusions, say doctors. At present, however, there is no acute shortage, with official data showing that the 90 National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO)-controlled blood banks in Tamil Nadu having around 35,000 units of blood. “Though there is nothing to panic as of now, we are taking adequate steps to increase voluntary blood donations in the coming days to avoid trouble,” said Deepak Jacob, member secretary of Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (Tansacs). T Raja, an oncologist from Chennai, said his hospital transfused at least 600 units of red blood cells and 600 units of platelets every month. “So far we are managing with our large access to donors. But we foresee difficulties as those who get vaccinated or infected might not be able to donate. Besides this, accessing hospitals will also be a problem for many due to fear of getting infected. Why would they come out when there is so much risk?” A senior Tamil Nadu Accident and Emergency Care Initiative (TAEI) doctor said they were requesting help from relative donors but this could change in the coming days. The accident rate may also come down if stringent lockdown norms are introduced like last year. A majority of accidents last year were minor ones and roughly 5% needed blood transfusions, he said. Tamil Nadu last year reported roughly 4,000 accidents every month. Arun Kesav of PPP Foundations, a not-for-profit organisation in the field of blood donation, said finding donors becomes tough when a negative type is involved. “For every 25 requests made from hospitals in and around Madurai, we used to find at least 15 donors. We are struggling to find even five now,” he said. R Ravi, a blood bank in-charge at a private hospital in Madurai, said the number of voluntary donors dropped from 100 a day in 2019 to 50 last month. On Sunday, just one donor turned up. Elective surgeries are being also postponed, but the number of deliveries, requiring blood, remains unchanged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/jabs-for-18-45-may-hit-blood-donations/articleshow/82267110.cms||Ram Sundaram
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Bizman’s killers trained in bomb attacks for a month||CHENNAI: Two days after the sensational murder of businessman Thirumaran at a Maraimalai Nagar temple, one of his killers surrendered before a court in Trichy and police found the assailants had been trained in bomb attacks before the killing. Investigators said Thirumaran, an AIADMK functionary and a Chengalpet resident, had survived two attempts on his life in 2016 and 2017, both hatched by Rajesh, his former business partner. Rajesh was booked for attempt to murder and jailed before being released on bail. Apprehending more threats to his life, Thirumaran applied to a court and obtained an armed personal security officer (PSO), an investigator said. He also obtained an unlicensed pistol from Nagaland, the officer said. Thirumaran began the business of supplying private companies with daily-wage workers along with Rajesh and his friend Jagan. As he began to thrive, he decided to end the partnership and that was allegedly that start of Rajesh’s enmity with him, the officer said. Later, he diversified into the real estate sector as well as the iron scrap business and became enormously wealthy. He also made another enemy, a local with a crime record. Rajesh, who saw this as a chance, tied up with the history-sheeter and hatched a plan to murder Thirumaran. A man named Mahesh from Maraimalai Nagar is said to have helped supply them with hired killers, who were trained for at least a month in hurling country-made bombs, the officer said. On Saturday, police said, Thirumaran went to the Arulmigu Selva Muthukumara Swamy temple in Maraimalai Nagar with his wife on the occasion of their wedding anniversary. They were escorted by his personal security officer Ezhilarasan, a policeman. At 6.30pm, Thirumaran received a call on his phone and walked to the entrance. His wife remained inside. While he was on the call, a gang of men hurled a bomb at Thirumaran. He managed to escape, but the gang members threw another bomb at him and as he fell to the ground they hacked him to death, said a police officer. As the assailants tried to escape, his PSO, Ezhilarasan, opened fire, killing one of them on the spot, the officer said. The dead assailant, later identified as 19-year-old Suresh, was a native of Athur in Tiruvallur district. Police have launched a hunt for Mahesh, the history sheeter and rest of the gang members whose images were caught on a CCTV camera at the temple. The Maraimalai Nagar police, who said they are yet to clearly establish the links among all the assailants, are likely to take Rajesh into their custody for further inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/bizmans-killers-trained-in-bomb-attacks-for-a-month/articleshow/82267114.cms||---

Maldives and UAE were the popular destinations for people from Chennai and travel was reviving after restrictions eased in the last three months. With cases growing and flight restrictions still in force, the city will not get foreign travellers either. Foreign tourists usually arrive in June-July. VFS has also suspended issuing visas for almost all major countries while the US has closed its consulate for appointments till May 15.Travel and tour operators say this will impact the confidence level of travellers and it may be three to four months before people ventured out. The sector is now staring at a repeat of 2020.Ramji Natarajan of Travel Masters India said "We were banking on the April-May season. This is gone now with almost all destinations out of reach. Domestic holidays too are not happening because of the high number of Covid-19 cases and shutdowns. It is going to be worse than last year as the few countries that were allowing us to fly too are blocking. It will take a long time for the people to have confidence to travel. People have started to rethink essential travel too." With the prospects of revival looking bleak, travel and tour operators suggest that the government should step in.Basheer Ahmed of Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI) said, “It looks like there may not be much movement in terms of passengers for three to six months. This is the time for the government to step in and help tourism to survive.”S Shaktivadivel, honorary secretary, southern region, Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI), said government and industry should take steps to boost confidence to encourage travel post-Covid-19. “The domestic e-pass system should be standardized, private charter should be allowed on domestic and international routes, a vaccine passport should be worked out, airlines should step up safety measures like leaving the middle seat empty,” he said. There should also be some relief measure from the government, added.Ramji said that “It’s time for the government to form a high-powered committee involving senior travel professionals and gather feedback and formulate a strategy or stimulus.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/its-curtains-for-intl-travel-foreign-arrivals-this-season/articleshow/82267115.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Business||Lockdowns could disrupt supplies, fuel inflation: RBI||MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India has said in its ‘State of the Economy’ report that the resurgence in Covid infections, if not contained in time, risks protracted restrictions and disruptions in supply chains and consequent inflationary pressures. The RBI’s warning comes at a time when prospects of regional lockdowns have increased with rising cases of the disease. The central bank has said that it was important to entrench India’s inflation at 4% so that it (RBI) can continue to play its stabilising role. “When inflation goes beyond the comfort zone, the exclusive concern of monetary policy must be to bring it back to the target,” said the report in RBI’s Bulletin. “When inflation is within the comfort zone, authorities can look to other objectives—the objective of control of inflation is not independent of the objective of growth,” the report said. It is not clear how the inflation numbers for April and May will play out, given an uncertain base. “Going forward, the calculation of year-on-year CPI (consumer price index) inflation prints for April and May 2021 is subject to uncertainty, given that April and May CPIs a year ago were not based on actual price data collections but were imputed,” the report said. However, two positive developments were the forecast of a normal monsoon and the easing of crude oil over fears of fall in demand due to a resurgence of the pandemic. Noting that on April 19 the government announced vaccinations for all adults, the report said that economic activity in India is holding up admirably against Covid’s renewed onslaught. “Much attention has been drawn to the wilting of incoming data in the face of the second wave and localised restrictions. Yet, it is important to note that it is the sentiment indicators that have moderated,” the report said.

---||Chennai||New Tamil Nadu government has a financial mess to clear||By R Srinivasan & S Raja Sethu Durai Every new government is always in a haste to implement the election promises without taking stock of the financial situation of the state. The government that takes charge in Tamil Nadu from May 2021 should line up the resources to tackle the second and bigger Covid-19 wave along with massive vaccination. Spreading the scarce resources over all programmes is a necessity, instead of making election promises a priority. A glance at the revenue receipts of Tamil Nadu (see graphic) indicates the state’s own tax revenue has registered a growth of 10.5% per year between 2011-12 and 2017-18, while the share of central taxes grew by 14.8% per year in the same period. Subsequently, there is a sharp fall in the state’s own tax revenue growth at 4.5% per year and negative growth in the share of central taxes in recent times as per the revised estimates of 2020-21. The general decline in economic growth began around 2014, and adding to that was demonetisation and GST disrupted state’s own tax collections since 2017. Tamil Nadu in every budget showed that the inter se share of Tamil Nadu in central taxes has been reduced by successive Finance Commissions. When the 14th Finance Commission increased the states’ share in central taxes to 42%, the Union government responded with more cess and surcharges that need not be shared with states. Neither the state’s own tax revenues nor the central transfers have been buoyant in recent times for reasons mostly beyond the control of the state government. There is still scope for better tax collection with tight administration. Consequently, borrowing is the only option, but it is not without limits. Outstanding liabilities The Tamil Nadu state government’s outstanding liability (see graphic) has increased roughly from `1.31 lakh crore in 2011-12 to `4.86 lakh crore in 2020-21. This is approximately 30% growth per year. The Tamil Nadu State Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) outstanding liabilities increased from `48,000 crore in 2011-12 to `1.68 lakh crore in 2017-18, which is 42% growth per year. It is an open secret that both the state ad Union governments indulge in extra-budgetary borrowings through PSUs in addition to their own borrowing in the budget. The PSUs’ borrowing was 37% of government debt in 2011-12, and it increased to 51% in 2017-18. What is worrying here is that the extra-budgetary borrowings are growing faster than the state government’s own borrowing in the public account. Another disturbing factor is the interest rate at which these borrowings are being made. The interest payment as a proportion to the outstanding liabilities is a crude indicator of the interest rate. It was 6.8% for state government and 9% for state PSUs in 2011-12, and the corresponding rates were 8% and 9.6% in 2017-18. The interest rates on both government and its PSU borrowings increase at a higher rate, with the interest rate for PSU has always been higher than that of the government. Interest rate is the summary indicator of the borrower’s credibility perceived by the market, though many credit rating agencies provide the state and its PSUs creditworthiness. Among the major states in India, the borrowings of the Tamil Nadu government have been at some of the highest interest rates. If PSUs’ borrowing interest rates are higher too, then the state government’s credibility and its PSUs are pretty low in the market. The annoying story of the state government and its PSUs borrowings till 2017-18 turned murkier after that. The outstanding liabilities of the state increased at 16% per annum to `4.86 lakh crore in 2020-21. Though the figures for the borrowings of the PSUs for the same period are not available, it is likely to be around 60% of the state’s borrowings as the operating expenses of PSUs have been more than their present revenue, particularly in the transport sector. Tamil Nadu’s outstanding liabilities would be roughly `8 lakh crore with an interest payment of `80,000 crore per year, which is almost 44% of the revenue receipts of the state. The government could give many reasons, such as declining tax collections due to Covid-19 and demonetisation or GST disruptions. They can also blame the increasing expenditure for healthcare and rebooting the economy with a demand-side boost through hiked transfer payments. The government can also say that the debt is sustainable as they are within statutory limits. Apart from declining current revenue, the secular increase in revenue expenditure is its curse. The salaries, pensions and subsidies and grants (mainly for salaries) to autonomous bodies and local governments account for more than 150% of state’s own revenue. These expenditures along with interest payment should increase at least 10% every year. Therefore, to maintain the deficit at the current level the state’s own revenue should increase by 10%, an impossible target in the present situation. Prudence is social justice The nature of financial markets is to hear only the heartbeat of financial health of the state, that is, its credibility as a prudent spender. For instance, reviving education sector to make up for the loss in learning is one of the biggest challenges. No amount of reservation and other social justice programmes can bridge the learning deficit created in the past one year and this will aggregate in this year as well. It is essential to calculate the cost of immediate implementation of election promises in terms of the foregone expenditures that would be showing off their absence in times of need. This is financial prudence. Therefore, the immediate task before the new government in Tamil Nadu is to take a deep dive into the financial situation of the state and its PSUs and work to stabilize revenue growth and prune expenditure profligacy. Freezing salaries and reducing retirement age to increase employment will reduce salary expenditure and grants, but it could be unfeasible. The alternate bitter pill to bite is to privatise government functions to keep costs under leash. Improve efficiency of government enterprises to increase their profits or to reduce their losses. Increase non-tax revenue through collecting user charges for government services. Assign more financial powers to local bodies and incentivise to collect more revenue from residents and in turn reduce transfers and grants. After all, money cannot be created out of thin air.

On April 20, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had ordered the administration to take action under NSA against black marketers and illegal hoarders of essential drugs, including Remdesivir. The Ujjain administration on Monday booked eight nursing staff of Deshmukh Hospital and RD Gardi Medical College under NSA after they were allegedly caught selling Remdesivir at inflated prices, Chimanganj police station in-charge Ajit Tiwari said. Police recovered three Remdesivir vials and two antibiotic injections from them during raids on Saturday, said Tiwari. The ring was broken after police caught three nurses of RD Gardi Hospital — Lokesh Anjana, Priyesh Chouhan and Bhanupratap Singh — selling Remdesivir on Agar Road, the officer said. Their interrogation led to the trio’s colleagues Vaibhav Panchal and Hariom Anjana, and then to Deshmukh Hospital nurses Sarfaraz Shah, Kuldeep Chouhan and Rajesh Narvariya. All the accused are aged between 19 and 25 years. In Indore, NSA was invoked against five persons, including a ward boy. Three of the suspects — Bajrang Rathore, Ankit Patwari and Mansingh Meena — worked at a private hospital and were arrested with three Remdesivir vials on Saturday, SP-crime branch Guru Prasad Parashar told TOI. Rathore, a ward boy, had allegedly stolen the vials from the hospital and sold it to ambulance driver Ankit for Rs 18,000 each, who later sold the injections to Mansingh, a caretaker at the hospital, for Rs 28,000 each. Two other men were caught selling saline in Remdesivir vials after a hotel owner, who had bought them for Rs 20,000 each, complained to police. Sixteen people have now booked under NSA since April 21, when Indore district magistrate Manish Singh invoked the law against three persons for illegal sale of Remdesivir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/mp-nsa-charges-on-13-for-illegal-remdesivir-sale/articleshow/82267109.cms||---

This is despite district collector Ajay Gulhane imposing restriction on distribution of oxygen for anything other than treatment of Covid.  The two private oxygen generation units in Chandrapur have already been prohibited from supplying oxygen for industrial use, and their entire production roped in for Covid treatment. Gulhane claimed that the oxygen available in district is barely meeting the demand of patients in government and private hospitals. Four or five hospital proposals have been given permission, but instructed to arrange for their own oxygen. The available oxygen supply is just meeting the demand, and hence administration cannot take responsibility of additional supply unless more oxygen generation resources are created, he said. Doctors bidding to start Covid facilities have been asked to raise their own units of oxygen generation if they want to start immediately, or wait till the administration raises new oxygen generation facility, he told TOI. Gulhane said the district currently has two oxygen generating units in district. While one generates 11.6MT oxygen per day, the other generates 8.6MT. Out of this, 6.5MT oxygen is supplied to Gadchiroli and Yavatmal as per pre-arranged terms. Remaining entire production of oxygen is taken by the district administration to cater to demand at government and private hospitals. “We need around 21MT oxygen per day to cater to the needs of the district. We are taking 14MT from two private dealers, while meeting requirement of remaining oxygen from other sources. Starting of liquid oxygen unit at GMCH Women’s Hospital has brought some respite. Yet another liquid oxygen generation unit is going to start at Civil Hospital premises in two days,” he said. The collector said that as the load of patients is increasing, district administration has kicked off plans to raise oxygen generation units. “We are going to start six plants to produce oxygen from air. One of these mega plants with capacity of filling 500 cylinders is proposed in Chandrapur city. Five other oxygen generation plants, each having capacity to service 50 oxygen beds per day, would come up in Rajura, Warora, Chimur, Brahmapuri and Mul tehsil headquarters,” he said. Gulhane had inspected one of the oxygen generation plants with SP Arvind Salve a couple of days back. He has warned of strict action under the disaster management law against those using oxygen for anything else than treating Covid patients. He has appointed resident deputy collector Manohar Gawhal as oxygen control officer for district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/only-new-plants-can-alleviate-oxygen-shortage-in-chanda/articleshow/82264214.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Chennai||Meet the centenarian medical superintendent of Madurai corporation||The first woman medical superintendent of the Madurai corporation, Dr R S Padmavathy, turned 100 on Monday. Her entry to the medical field shattered preconceived notions about women and helped more women to come forward to seek medical consultation.Born on April 26, 1921, Padmavathy was the eldest daughter of a government doctor at the Erskine Hospital, the present-day Government Rajaji Hospital. A woman becoming a professional, more so a doctor was unheard of in her community — the Rajus. It was her father Dr R Sundarajan’s vision that helped her break barriers, not just for herself, but for all his women patients. Dr Sundarajan realised that women were apprehensive of consulting male doctors and were losing their lives. He decided to make his first born, Padmavathy, a doctor.After completing her intermediate studies at the American College in Madurai, she went to study medicine at the Madras Medical College. Facing up to community pressure with her books being thrown or hidden by elders, she later inspired five of her sisters to follow in her footsteps. After graduating in 1948, Dr Padmavathy was appointed as a government doctor in Kodaikanal. A year later, she felt the women in Madurai needed her service more. That’s when her father made her quit her government job and join the Madurai municipality as a doctor. The municipality had three women doctors then, the others were from other states, she was the only one from southern Tamil Nadu who knew the region.She was promoted as the medical superintendent of maternity centres, in the Madurai municipality in 1955, and held the same post till her retirement in 1977. Those were the days when institutionalized delivery wasn’t common. To make childbirth as safe as possible at home, Dr Padmavathy implemented the system where the corporation staff followed up on cases regularly and assisted deliveries at homes.In 1969, when the World Health Organisation (WHO) conducted an advanced training in maternity and childcare at Warsaw, Poland, Dr Padmavathy was one of the three doctors chosen by the Indian government to attend it. Returning with a hoard of information, she implemented vacuum assisted deliveries in the Madurai corporation. Sign boards and placards were made to adorn the walls of her clinic to inspire young doctors who came there for training.It was her vision that child healthcare became an important part of the maternity system, which led to the two being integrated in the medical system in hospitals. Carrying forward her legacy, one of her three sons Gurusundar and daughter Geethalakshmi are doctors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/meet-the-centenarian-medical-superintendent-of-madurai-corporation/articleshow/82267128.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Asha workers allege verbal abuse from home quarantined||NAGPUR: ‘Asha’ health workers allege they are facing increased verbal abuse by Covid-19 patients whose homes they visit as part of a health-monitoring protocol. Under the banner of Asha Gatpravartak Karamachari Union (AGKU), these almost 3,000 workers in the district say they have unwittingly become the ‘face’ of the healthcare infrastructure against which the common public is venting its anger. General secretary of the union Priti Meshram said this trend of abuse is seen more in rural areas. “Around 1,720 of our members in rural Nagpur jurisdiction are actively involved in helping authorities with Covid-related duties. One of the key things we handle is monitoring the health of Covid patients who are under home quarantine. Every day our union receives complaints regarding verbal abuse being meted out to the ladies,” said Meshram.  She said patients are blaming them for the health infrastructure’s inability to handle the steep surge in cases. “Their anger might be against somebody else, but because we land up at their doorstep we become the face of everything that’s making them frustrated. There have been cases in Hingna taluka where Asha workers were abused in filthy language by women of the house.” Meshram said the abuses and ‘shouting matches’ were focussed on one or two specific things. “Some of them ask us to come inside the house and check the oxygen level and/or give medicines directly to the patient. That’s not part of the protocol, we don’t have to enter the house of an infected person and risk ourselves,” said Meshram.  The other point of friction was about the health infrastructure. “How can we answer about availability of beds in hospitals or shortage of medicines. These discussions turn into unnecessary arguements. Our Asha workers are trying to cover as many houses as possible in a day and try to keep the questions focussed on the information we need. But people don’t understand and expect us to answer them like doctors,” said Meshram.  The union fears that these abuses may one day turn into an ugly situation. Meshram said, “We have directed our members to keep calm and just do their job. We understand that people are frustrated and that’s why we are not filing an official complaint. But if this continues, we may have to take a tough stance and restrict movement of our members by keeping their safety in mind.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/asha-workers-allege-verbal-abuse-from-home-quarantined/articleshow/82264227.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
