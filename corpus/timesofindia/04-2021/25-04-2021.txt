Goa must bounce back from two straight defeats against last year’s finalists Persepolis FC . Fatigue has taken a toll on the Goa squad and it was visible in their 0-4 defeat at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Friday. “It was a very difficult match. Firstly, because Persepolis is a very good team and secondly because lots of players have been exhausted. It is difficult because you have one day to prepare the game and the squad is short. “It’s not an excuse, but we also have mistakes in crosses, in transition. At the end, the score is normal because Persepolis is four or five steps more than Goa,” Ferrando said after the game. The Spanish made eight changes to his starting line-up after they went down bravely 1-2 against Persepolis in the first leg. Captain Edu Bedia missed the return leg due to suspension and it left a big void. Moreover, goalkeeper Naveen Kumar, who replaced the impressive Dheeraj Singh, should have done better as defensive errors crippled Goa. Persepolis too made six changes but with the depth in their squad they were never troubled. “It’s not possible in training sessions to prepare the team because now it is only recovery, recovery. In this case it is a problem for the players. “They tried their best, but in my opinion after conceding the second goal, the psychology of the players. When you are tired and concede the second goal against Persepolis, it is a difficult moment,” said Ferrando. Goa put a commendable display in their first two games as they became the first club from India to feature in Asia’s premier club competition. Goalless draws against Qatar Stars League outfit Al Rayyan and UAE side Al Wahda had taken many by surprise. They will now look to regain their confidence when they face Al Rayyan on Monday and Al Wahda three days later. Recovery, though, will be the key. “The score is not good for our psychology of course. Firstly, the players are tired. When you lose 4-0 and know this is the last week and you know you play Al Rayyan and Al Wahda, two very good teams, it’s very, very difficult I know. At the end we have two or three days in the next game,” said Ferrando.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/had-to-make-changes-lot-of-players-exhausted-ferrando/articleshow/82235750.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

For the fifth consecutive day, the country reported over 2,000 daily deaths. The case and death count for Saturday stood at 3.49 lakh and 2,760 in that order. The past 3 days alone saw over a million new cases and over 7,500 fresh deaths. A global comparison shows that there is a huge gap in fresh cases reported from India which is the world’s worst-hit country at present and the USA which is the world’s second-worst in terms of daily cases. Compared to 3.46 lakh cases reported in India on Friday, USA had reported 63,206 fresh cases. Apart from these two no other country has reported more than 50,000 cases on Friday.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Even in its neighborhood, no country comes close to India. On Friday Pakistan reported 5,870 fresh cases while the numbers were 3629, 2449 and 969 for Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka respectively. The ongoing blitzkrieg of Covid-19 cases seems to have started since April 6 – the day from which daily cases have never dropped below 1 lakh. Since April 6 there has not been a single day that saw less than 600 Covid-19 deaths. On the other hand, deaths have also steadily increased to cross the 2700 markState-wise analysis of data shows the pattern is largely the same as on Friday. Maharashtra is leading the states with 67,160 fresh cases while UP is the second-worst with 38,055 cases on Saturday.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); The other states that reported over 20,000 cases are Karnataka, Kerala and Delhi in the order of high to low cases. Like cases, Maharashtra also led the states in deaths as the state reported 676 deaths in the past 24 hours. The national capital also reported 357 deaths. Meanwhile, Congress MLA Kalawati Bhuriya died of Covid-related complications in an Indore hospital on Saturday. A first-time MLA, she was the niece of Congress veteran Kantilal Bhuria.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-daily-cases-touch-3-5-lakh-2760-die-in-24-hours/articleshow/82236321.cms||---
---||India||Online registration must for 18+ to get Covid vaccine||NEW DELHI: Persons in the 18-45 age group eligible for anti-Covid vaccines from May 1 will need to mandatorily register online on the Co-Win platform and seek an appointment to get vaccinated as walk-ins will not be permissible, at least in the beginning of the new inoculation drive. Registration can be done from April 28. Walk-in facility, which got a good response in the 60-plus and 45-plus groups, is not being provided as government expects a big jump in the number of vaccinations in phase 3 of the drive at a time when supplies are limited, official sources said. The measure is also expected to prevent crowding at vaccination centres. “Phase 3 means a large number of people and it cannot be implemented without planning, otherwise it will result in chaos. Online registration will help vaccination centres plan sessions in advance, manage crowds as well as supply of vaccines,” a senior official told TOI.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); While India administered over 14 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccines till Saturday 8pm, daily vaccinations are on a decline for nearly three weeks now. On Saturday, 24.22 lakh doses were given till 8pm. Apart from fear of infection amid the current surge, vaccines supplies have been reported to be erratic. So far, vaccination numbers were largely driven by walk-in beneficiaries. Of the total 12.21 crore registrations till Saturday, over 68% were by walk-ins and merely 11.6% were registered prior vaccination. Apart from these two categories, 2.43 crore health and frontline workers have also been registered by governments and their data pre-populated into the Co-Win system. The Centre issued an advisory to states asking them to augment infrastructure and suggesting specific measures for the phase 3. Apart from asking states to publicise the “only online registration” for 18-45 age group, the Centre suggested that states should register additional private vaccination Centres (CVCs) in mission mode by engaging private hospitals, facilities in industrial establishments and industry associations. It also asked states to monitor number of hospitals that have procured vaccines and have declared stocks and prices on Co-Win. The Centre also advised states to prioritise decisions regarding direct procurement of vaccines by state and UT governments and coordinate with law-and-order authorities for effective crowd management at CVCs.

Significantly, the FIR focuses on the controversial reinstatement of Assistant Police Inspector Sachin Vaze of Antilia notoriety, saying that twin decisons to rehabilitate the “encounter” specialist and the subdsequent decison to task him with important cases were “in the knowledge” of Deshmukh: something which immediately sparked speculation that those who directly took the calls could also be in agency's crosshairs. The FIR was filed on April 21 (Wednesday) under section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act and section 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC and names Deshmukh as an accused. Deshmukh is likely to be extensively grilled in the coming days, a source said. The agency conducted massive searches at multiple locations across Maharashtra through Saturday. CBI teams also searched the premises of Deshmukh in Nagpur and Mumbai in morning and evening. The agency is learnt to have seized electronic gadgets and incriminating documents after the searches. The CBI said that all agency officers, part of the raids, wore PPE kits while following all Covid protocols. Searches over for today. The searches were conducted simultaneously at four locations from 7.30am onwards. Three of Deshmukh's premises, including his office, were searched, a source said. Sources say the CBI has been able to collect some prima facie technical evidence on basis of which the allegations apparently seem to be prima facie corroborating. “The facts which emerged during the preliminary enquiry (PE) need a thorough probe for which an FIR is required,” said an official. The CBI's FIR comes after the agency conducting and exhaustive preliminary enquiry for two weeks on the orders of the Bombay high court. On April 14, the CBI had grilled Deshmukh for eight hours in connection after quizzing multiple people in the case. The FIR, a copy of which is with TOI, states that the PE had prima facie revealed that a cognizable offence was made out in the matter wherein Deshmukh and others have attempted to obtain undue advantage for improper and dishonest performance of the public duty. The PE has revealed that API Sachin Waze was reinstated in the service after being out of service for 15 years and entrusted with most of the sensational and important cases of Mumbai police with Deshmukh being in knowledge of this fact. The FIR also mentions part of Param Bir Singh's 104-page-long complaint alleging that Deshmukh and others exercised undue influence over transfer postings of police personnel “thereby exercising undue influence over their performance”.

It also decided to exempt basic customs duty on import for Covid vaccines with immediate effect for three months, a move expected to help step up supplies of a wide range of shots in the country and help accelerate the vaccination drive. The waiver of the 10% levy will also ensure consumers do not have to pay a higher price. The decisions were taken at a meeting chaired by PM Modi to review steps taken to boost oxygen availability in the country. Modi emphasised there was an urgent need to augment the supply of medical grade oxygen and equipment required for patient care both at home and in hospitals. He was briefed that basic customs duty was exempted on Remdesivir & its API recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-waives-duty-on-oxygen-vaccine-imports-for-3-months/articleshow/82237056.cms||---

A communique from the Army said 384 labourers working with the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) in the area had been rescued. Six of them were critical. There were 430 labourers in two BRO camps in the area which were hit by the avalanche. “The incident took place around 4 pm on Friday when an avalanche hit a location about 4 km ahead of Sumna on Sumna-Rimkhim road in Uttarakhand. This is on Joshimath-Malari- Girthidobla-Sumna-Rimkhim axis. A BRO detachment and two labour camps exist nearby for road construction work along this axis. An Army camp is located 3 km from Sumna. The area has experienced heavy rains and snow since the last five days which is still continuing,” the communique said. According to army officials, Border Road Task Force (BRTF) teams from Joshimath were working to clear slides en route from Bhapkund to Sumna and it was expected to take some more time to clear the complete axis since rains and pressure winds were disrupting the rescue and road clearing operations. A BRO official from Joshimath told TOI that four choppers along with an avalanche-sniffer dog and several rescue personnel were on the ground, involved in rescue work. National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) teams were assisting the Army and ITBP in clearing the snow-laden route leading up to the area. CM Tirath Singh Rawat also held an aerial inspection of Sumna and adjoining areas on Saturday to take stock of the situation. He said that he spoke with home minister Amit Shah, who assured him of the required assistance in the rescue and relief operations. ITBP PRO Vivek Pandey told TOI that the ITBP camps in the area were safe. Geologists, meanwhile, were of the opinion that the avalanche may not have been triggered by a glacier burst. MPS Bisht, director of Uttarakhand Space Application Centre (USAC) said that according to initial reports accessed by USAC, the avalanche may have occurred due to heavy snowfall. In a similar vein, Kalachand Sain, director of Doon-based Wadia Institute of Himalayan Glaciology said that a snow avalanche was possible in the area but there was very little possibility of it occurring due to glacier break. Bisht further said, “This place is approximately 25 km upstream from Malari village in the tributary of Girthiganga which is further bifurcated in two — one is Rimkhim and another is Kiogad. Both drained out from Rimkhim Pass and Sankcha Malla (Tibetan borderlands).” He added that in April 2003, 11 jawans had died in a similar snow avalanche incident at the Sumna ITBP camp.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/avalanche-kills-10-at-bro-camps-near-china-border/articleshow/82237240.cms||Prashant Jha

While admitting to shortage of oxygen supplies in the district, the administration alleged negligence by Neelkanth Hospital for the six deaths and instituted an investigation after a directive from CM Amarinder Singh. ‘If only the hospital authorities had informed us about the shortage of oxygen last night, we would have averted the tragic deaths,” medical education and research minister O P Soni said. He pointed out that the state-run Guru Nanak Dev Hospital and a private hospital had faced an oxygen shortage on Thursday night, but the district administration arranged the required quantity of oxygen by 1.30am. Neelkanth Hospital’s managing director Sunil Devgun said relatives of the patients had been advised to shift them to other facilities when oxygen supplies didn’t arrive on time. “For the last 48 hours, we had been constantly asking the district administration for supply of oxygen, but to no avail.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/oxygen-shortage-leaves-6-dead-in-amritsar-hospital/articleshow/82237269.cms||Yudhvir Rana

It also said 3,816 Covid Care Coaches are also ready for deployment across the country to supplement the healthcare facilities. In a statement, the railways said the Oxygen Expresses with Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) tankers have arrived at Nashik and Lucknow. “Few Containers were also unloaded at Nagpur and Varanasi enroute to supply LMO in these regions. Also, the third Oxygen Express started its journey from Lucknow this (Saturday) morning. States like Andhra Pradesh and Delhi are in consultation with railways to run more such trains,” it said. In order to meet the requirement in Uttar Pradesh, a green corridor was created between Lucknow to Varanasi. Transportation of oxygen through trains is faster over long distances than road transport since trains run 24x7 unlike road tankers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/150-tonnes-delivered-so-far-by-oxygen-express-railways/articleshow/82237295.cms||---
---||India||Medical oxygen supply up 5% since Tuesday, govt wants monitoring, wastage reduced||NEW DELHI: While getting industry to step up oxygen production and initiate steps to source supplies from other parts of the world, the Centre is seeking to get states to monitor supplies better, while also reducing wastage. Latest data showed that supply for medical use has increased to around 6,600 metric tonnes, which is 5% higher than Tuesday, and it is also 58% more than the level 10 years ago. Production too has increased during the period, hitting 8,500 metric tonnes, which is around 5% higher than Tuesday and nearly 13% higher than April 23. While there is a limit to increase the output, demand from hospitals has been on the rise. But the good news is that the stock of liquid medical oxygen has not depleted significantly. The government is hoping that a series of steps that have been announced, incl-uding airlifting of oxygen and equipment from overs-eas — from Singapore and Israel to Germany — will help augment supplies in the coming days, although demand is rising at a rapid ra-te due to a massive jump in new Covid-19 cases. Separately, the Centre also discussed ways to step up monitoring by states with Uttar Pradesh’s dashboard and coordination, which includes a mobile app for each hospital’s requirement to be fed and tracking of each consignment on a real time basis. Besides, some states such as Kerala and Maharash-tra are seen to be ensuring that wastage is low, something that other states need to follow, an officer said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has reviewed the entire mechanism and steps have been announced, based on feedback from industry and government departments. In fact, on April 6, following a meeting between commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal, Drug Controller General of India and stakeholders, including All India Industrial Gases Manufacturers Association and the department for promotion of industry and internal trade, got the health ministry to issue an order to allow industrial oxygen manufacturers to produce oxygen for medical use. This move is seen to have helped augment capacity over the last few days as industrial oxygen manufacturers were to be granted a licence to make oxygen for medical use within 24 hours of receipt of application and payment of fee. Since the order was issued on April 7, production has shot up around 35%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/medical-oxygen-supply-up-5-since-tuesday-govt-wants-monitoring-wastage-reduced/articleshow/82237403.cms||---

The IAF airlifted the first lot of four empty cryogenic oxygen cylinders from Singapore on Saturday, while its C-17 Globemaster-III and IL-76 heavy-lift aircraft continued to transport such large tankers from their place of use in the country to oxygen plants and filling stations to cut delays. While the four cylinders from Singapore were offloaded at Panagarh in West Bengal, C-17s transported two empty container trucks for liquid oxygen from Pune to Jamnagar and another from Jodhpur to Jamnagar Airlift of loaded liquid oxygen tankers is not being carried out because it can be potentially hazardous if the aircraft suddenly loses cabin pressure at high altitude, as was earlier reported by TOI. A Chinook heavy-lift helicopter also airlifted 850-kg load of medical equipment for Covid testing from Jammu to Leh. Naval warships are also being kept on standby for any assistance in moving oxygen tankers. INS Sharda, for instance, has been deputed as the “oxygen express” to ferry cylinders to Lakshadweep and Minicoy islands. DRDO chief Dr Satheesh Reddy said the number of beds at the Sadar Vallabhbhai Patel Covid facility in Delhi has been increased from 250 to 500, while the 1,000-bed hospital at Ahmedabad is fully operational now. “Similarly, the 450-bed hospital at Lucknow would become operational in the next five to six days. It will be run by the Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS) in coordination with the UP government,” said an official. “As the AFMS has its resources stretched to the limit, services of local doctors and health professionals might be enlisted for the 750-bed hospital that is coming up at Varanasi,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-help-civilians-facilities-of-defence-psus-ofb-told/articleshow/82237555.cms||---

State governments can take help from agencies like the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and similar agencies in the private sector to build these field hospitals. Health secretary Rajesh Bhushan and Dr R S Sharma, chairman of the empowered group on technology and data management on Covid-19 chaired a high-level meeting with states on Saturday to review situation of health infrastructure and vaccination in the wake of rising Covid-19 cases. Regarding infrastructure augmentation for effective clinical treatment of the hospitalised Covid-19 patients, states were advised to review their existing hospital and other Covid treatment infrastructure in view of the daily new case, daily fata-lity and those that would require hospitalization. States were advised to identify additional dedicated Covid-19 hospitals, setting up centralised call center-based services for allocation of beds, maintain a real-time record for available beds and make it easily accessible to the general public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/consider-field-hospitals-to-meet-vaccine-rush-centre-tells-states/articleshow/82237591.cms||---

Heading a three-judge bench, CJI S A Bobde on Friday – the last day of his retirement – cancelled the bail granted by Allahabad HC to Azamgarh gangster Arun Yadav, who was accused of gunning down one Rajnarain Singh. Singh’s widow had challenged the bail to Yadav, who faced 15 cases of murder or attempt to murder. The SC recalled the case relating to grant of parole to Vikas Dubey. “The appellant cites the example of a person who was prosecuted in connection with 64 criminal cases which included cases of murders, offences of dacoity, criminal intimidation, extortion and offences under the UP-Gangster Act, etc, but who was released on bail. Ultimately, when a police team went to apprehend him, allegedly eight policemen were killed,” the bench noted. It said, “We find in this case the HC has overlooked aspects, such as the potential threat to witnesses, forcing the trial court to grant protection (to the victim’s family). It is needless to point out that in cases of this nature, it is important that courts do not enlarge an accused on bail with a blinkered vision.” SC advised the HCs to examine a bail plea on these principles: Whether there was prima facie or reasonable ground to believe the accused had committed the offence; nature and gravity of accusations; severity of punishment in the event of conviction; danger of accused absconding or fleeing if granted bail; character, behaviour, means, position and standing of the accused; likelihood of repetition of offence; reasonable apprehension of witnesses being influenced; and danger of justice being thwarted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bail-not-jail-norm-not-for-gangsters-sc/articleshow/82237622.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

A god-fearing man, Justice Ramana sought blessings of archakas from Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam and Srisailam Devasthanam before taking oath in the name of God to discharge his duties as CJI without fear or favour. Though Saturday is not a working day for judges, the CJI drove straight to SC from Rashtrapati Bhavan and held a meeting with senior judges to discuss the future process to be adopted for adjudication of cases. Since the Covid pandemic took hold in India in March last year, the SC has been dispensing justice via videoconferencing mode. Most judges were of the opinion that the virtual conference mode should continue till the Covid situation is under control. The CJI would continue his deliberation with the judges about advancing the summer break to allow the court to take measures to vaccinate all its staff members and help out the families of staff who have been infected with coronavirus. The CJI also took note of the representation by the SC Bar Association for introduction of a Rs 100 lawyers welfare stamp to be affixed on vakalatnamas for creating a corpus that would be utilised for giving financial aid to lawyers in distress due to loss of income due to disruption of physical hearings as well as for families whose lawyer bread winners have succumbed to Covid. Justice Ramana was a first generation lawyer born in an agricultural family in Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh. After his student activist days, he had briefly experimented with journalism by working in a Telugu newspaper before choosing to be an advocate. He was appointed as judge of Andhra Pradesh HC in 2001, chief justice of Delhi HC in September 2013 and a judge of SC in February 2014. A soft-spoken person, Justice Ramana has given hard-hitting judgments including the ruling on providing 4G internet in J&K, where the government had suspended high-speed internet after scrapping the state’s special status under Article 370. The Justice Ramana-led bench had ruled that “access to internet” is a fundamental right. A bench headed by him had also brought the CJI’s office under the Right to Information Act. Justice Ramana-led bench had directed speeding up trials pending for years against sitting and former MPs and MLAs. He faced accusations from Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, who faces trial in a dozen cases probed by the CBI and ED. Last month, then CJI S A Bobde had dismissed Reddy’s complaint against Justice Ramana. Justice Ramana will face many challenges in his tenure. including achieving a consensus in the Collegium, which now also comprises of Justices R F Nariman, U U Lalit, A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud, for filling the six vacancies in the SC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/48th-cji-ramana-takes-charge-on-a-saturday-and-gets-down-to-business/articleshow/82237623.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The medicine, which costs about Rs 900-Rs 2,000, was put up for auction and the winning bid was Rs 25,000. The bid was, however, placed by cops pretending to be relatives of a patient. The patient, Shobhit Jain, was to be administered the injection due to his critical condition. He got three doses but the fourth was pocketed by the nurses. When Jain died, they started looking for customers. “Our surveillance team and policemen were working on the case after a tip-off. They (the nurses) had quoted Rs 32,000.We have arrested the nurses, Abid Khan and Ankit Sharma,” said Ajay Sahani, SSP, Meerut. Six security guards at the hospital tried to protect the duo but were overpowered by the police team and arrested. All of them have been booked under IPC sections 420 (cheating), 147 (rioting), 342 (wrongful confinement), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), and 120-B (criminal conspiracy). Sections of Drugs and Cosmetics Act and Epidemic Diseases Act were also invoked against them. The hospital management supported the police action. “It was an isolated case and not a practice as claimed by the police. And as the policemen were in plain clothes carrying weapons, the guards on duty tried to stop them,” said Dr Atul Krishna, trustee of Subharti KKB Charitable Trust, which runs the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nurses-steal-dying-patients-remdesivir-try-to-auction-it/articleshow/82237628.cms||Sandeep Rai

The rescued officials are Mohini Mohan Gogoi and Alakesh Saikia. The search for the third, Ritul Saikia, is underway, authorities said. The rescue operation was jointly conducted by the Indian Army, Assam Rifles and Nagaland Police, with intelligence inputs from the Assam police. One AK-47 rifle was recovered from the site. Assam DGP Mahanta said the "encounter" had started early Saturday morning in the forests of Mon district, near the international border. However, Ulfa (I) said on Saturday it had released the three ONGC employees and left them "in the safe custody of the villagers of Tokok Singkhu in good health" fearing harm to their lives in the crossfire during the firefight with the Army, Assam Rifles and Nagaland Armed Police in Mon district. Ulfa-I publicity wing member Rumul Asom issued a statement asking why the security forces had said that only two, Mohini Mohan Gogoi and Alakesh Saikia, and not all three abductees, had been rescued. "We fear that the third person (Ritul Saikia) might have been killed in firing by security forces or he might have been kept in hiding by the security forces with an ulterior motive," Asom stated. Mohini Mohan Gogoi, Ritul Saikia and Alakesh Saikia were abducted in the early hours of Wednesday by suspected Ulfa(I) cadres from the company’s rig site at Lakwa, in Sivasagar district. GP Singh, special DGP (law and order), who is monitoring the probe as well as search operations, tweeted on Saturday, "When every available hand of @assampolice should be at beck & call of people of Assam to mitigate the hardships of 2nd wave of pandemic, misadventures of Ulfa has kept a large chunk of cops away from service to people of Assam. Abominable (sic)." Sivasagar SP Amitava Sinha said 14 people had been arrested from multiple locations in Sivasagar and Charaideo districts for alleged links to the abduction carried out by the proscribed outfit. An Assam police statement on Friday evening had said Ulfa-I was responsible for the abduction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/forces-rescue-2-of-3-abducted-ongc-officials/articleshow/82237630.cms||Rokibuz Zaman

Even secondary contacts are turning out symptomatic due to increased infectivity rates, which was sporadic last year. Medical experts attribute this trend to people lowering their guard against the pandemic along with a confluence of factors such as reduced testing, people thinking of the disease as easily manageable and fatigue in contact tracing and containment. The trend can also be linked to a higher number of asymptomatic youngsters getting infected and becoming silent carriers. Meanwhile, the jury is still out on the role of mutants in the spread of the second wave. All these factors have contributed to serpentine queues outside testing centres across the state and private diagnostic centres charging way higher than prescribed rates. Patients and their families have started complaining of bed and oxygen shortages, black marketing of medicines and fleecing by private hospitals. Even a year after the pandemic onset, uncertainty over transmission dynamics of the disease continues to reign, especially amid the ongoing explosive outbreak. The state health department had initially projected the second wave between January 15 to March 15. Advisories were issued to district officials on measures needed to foresee and contain the surge in infection numbers. But the anticipated uptick started in the fourth week of March, two months later than the initially projected timeline. Now, health officials expect that the cases may start declining only towards the end of May with increasing vaccine coverage. Speaking to TOI, AP Covid-19 nodal officer Dr K Rambabu said that the fear factor surrounding the outbreak during the first wave is largely absent in the second. “Unrestrained public movement, unlike lockdown during the first wave, might have also fuelled the spurt in case numbers,” Rambabu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/more-asymptomatic-youth-becoming-silent-carriers/articleshow/82234670.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

---||Allahabad||4 new oxygen plans to start production in city||Prayagraj: Four new oxygen production units would soon start functioning in the district after a go ahead from the state’s industries department, bringing an end to its shortage in view of the rising number of Covid-19 cases. Besides, efforts have begun for production of oxygen cylinders at the sick public sector unit, Bharat Pumps and Compressor Ltd. (BPCL), which, if operationalised, can produce 1,000 cylinders per day. Presently, there is a shortage of oxygen in the district as against the demand, just around one third of the patients are getting oxygen for their family members who are in need and infected by coronavirus. In this backdrop and following the instructions of the state government, the department of industry of the district has given approval to four companies to install the oxygen plant. “We have given permission to four companies which have contacted us for installing oxygen plants and some of them would start installing the machines in the next few weeks. Although the real production will start in around six weeks, once it gets going there will be no shortage of oxygen in the district,” said deputy director industries Ajay Chaurasiya. Along with this, a proposal has been sent to the Central government in regard to starting production of oxygen cylinders at the Bharat Pumps and Compressor Limited (BPCL), the public sector unit located in Naini. The importance of availability of oxygen is based on the availability of oxygen cylinders. There have been several cases in the district where the oxygen supply unit has oxygen, but the patients in need do not have cylinders to get it refilled. A few days back, BJP member of Parliament from Prayagraj, Rita Bahuguna Joshi had raised the issue with the Central ministry in connection with starting the production of cylinders at BPCL. BJP MP from Phulpur Kesari Devi Patel had also spoken to JP Nadda, national president of BJP and demanded that BPCL be permitted to manufacture oxygen cylinders. A proposal to this effect has been sent to the state government by the divisional commissioner, Sanjay Goyal. A senior employee leader of BPCL, RLD Dube, said the proposal is in an advanced stage and if things go right, the unit will start manufacturing oxygen cylinders by next week. “The factory has sufficient raw material and the technical know-how to produce the cylinders once getting a node from heavy industry ministry,” he added. Further, an oxygen plant, located at Teliarganj of the city, will also start functioning by next week. The state government has taken this on high priority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/4-new-oxygen-plans-to-start-production-in-city/articleshow/82235093.cms||---

What has left Aglawe’s family and the villagers awe-struck is the fact that he has emerged victorious at the age of 90 and is raring to go. “I did not allow the Covid-19 positive reports and dipping saturation levels to bring down my confidence level. I boosted myself with positive thoughts, healthy diet and timely medication,” Aglawe told TOI. The nonagenarian, who still does not require spectacles to read newspapers, has a piece of advice for today’s youth: Shun unhealthy lifestyle and addiction to vices like tobacco and drugs. Aglawe, who had first tested positive for the contagion in November last year, said recovery then was comparatively difficult as saturation level had dropped to 87% and RT-PCR score was 18. The elderly man’s son Vishnu (53), a Zilla Parishand teacher, told TOI that his friend had tested positive for Covid-19 in November, following which he got himself tested and the report came out positive. “My entire family was screened and my father was found Covid-19 positive, following which we were admitted to the Pisegaon-based Covid facility in Kej taluka of Beed district for 10 days and discharged after recovery,” said Vishnu. The health-conscious elderly comrade, who wakes up early in the morning for a walk, said, the second time he tested positive was on April 3. “I was immediately admitted to the Lokhandi Savargaon-based Covid facility and recovered from the disease within seven days and discharged.” However, Aglawe’s started feeling breathless on on April 13. His son took him to the Ambajogai-based Swami Ramanand Teerth Rural Government Medical College, where his saturation was found at 87% and RT-PCR was 18. He was put on oxygen support for five days before being discharged on April 17. Siddheshwar Birajdar, who treated the elderly man at the facility, confirmed that he had tested Covid-19 positive twice in the last six months. “Aglawe showed immense positive attitude and such things result in the release of positive hormones and eventually helped him fight the infection more effectively,” he added. Incidentally, Aglawe has not been vaccinated yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/at-90-beed-man-beats-covid-2nd-time-in-6-mths/articleshow/82234287.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Citing Ghosh, Modi further said the losses would be caused by the curfew, partial lockdown and restricted movement of people and transport, as has come into force to combat the spread of Covid-19. He said the government’s decision to provide free vaccination to 5.47 crore people in Bihar in the age-group of 18-44 years of age will alone cause an additional burden of Rs 4,500 crore. It includes the expenditure to be borne on transportation and maintenance of the vaccines, which the companies have priced at Rs 400 per dose. Every person has to be given two doses of the vaccine. Noting that the economic disruptions have also been caused by the return of migrant workers from other states, the former deputy CM said the Western Railways have ferried over 3.33 lakh migrant workers to Bihar and Uttar Pradesh between April 1 and 12. In addition, the Central Railways have transported over 4.70 lakh migrant workers during the same period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-to-suffer-rs-6222-crore-financial-loss-due-to-covid/articleshow/82234758.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Patna||Bihar: Bettiah hospital on toes as patients double||BETTIAH: Even though maximum Covid positive patients in West Champaran district are in home isolation, the earlier trickle of serious patients to the 120-bed Covid ward at the Government Medical College and Hospital at Bettiah is now rising rapidly. “Sixty-five patients, all on oxygen support, are undergoing treatment in the Covid isolation ward. Five of them are on ventilator support,” hospital superintendent Pramod K Tiwary told this newspaper on Saturday. By the time of filing this report in the evening, the number of patients had risen to 72. In just over two days, admissions have more than doubled. “We fear an exponential rise in admissions now,” Tiwary said, adding by Monday, another facility with 90 additional oxygen beds will be added. “In fact, we have further made a separate 30-bed isolation ward with oxygen support for patients we now find coming with negative test reports. Yet, their signs and symptoms aided with radiological findings suggest Covid affliction,” the superintendent said, adding two such patients have already been admitted. Twelve ventilator beds are operational and the hospital administration has promised to raise the facility to 55 ventilators by Monday. Meanwhile, state BJP chief Sanjay Jaiswal, also the local MP, who had visited the hospital earlier this week and had vowed to get the brand new yet inoperative oxygen plant at GMC functional, made good his promise on Saturday. “Sixty beds in the isolation ward are attached to the oxygen supply from the plant. In addition, we are getting 250 cylinder fills from the liquid oxygen plant in Harsidhi daily,” Tiwary said, adding the GMC is breathing easy on this front. “Our oxygen supplies will be augmented if needed,” he said. Outlining the mode of treatment, Tiwary stressed on a five-pronged strategy in place: oxygen, blood thinner, steroids, vitamins and antibiotics. “We do not have any anti-viral drugs like Remedisivir but their role is rather limited,” he said. Since April 11, 34 Covid patients have died in the district, 11 of them since Friday afternoon alone. Civil surgeon dr Arun K Sinha said 2,530 Covid active cases were reported till Friday evening. “The number of containment zones has been raised to 175. These include 107 in rural areas and 68 are in the towns,” the civil surgeon said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bettiah-hospital-on-toes-as-patients-double/articleshow/82234729.cms||Abhay Mohan Jha
---||Patna||Patna: Packed hospitals continue to turn away Covid-19 patients||PATNA: Most beds in Covid wards of government and private hospitals of Patna are full to their capacity. Though the status of bed occupancy is changing every few minutes with discharge of patients, the load remains almost the same as the hospitals hurriedly call the serious ones on their waiting list to rush for bed. Sounds of screeching sirens of ambulances continue even during the night curfew imposed by the government to check further spread of the deadly virus. Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) had all its 105 beds in the Covid ward occupied on Saturday. PMCH superintendent Dr I S Thakur said there was little scope to increase the number of Covid beds as all its other departments, OPDs, emergency and surgery units were functioning as usual. “About 350 to 400 non-Covid patients visit the OPDs per day. Several others are undergoing treatment in different wards despite the fact that 70 doctors and other medical staff are still in home isolation after contracting Covid,” he said. Likewise, the Covid ward at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P) had all its 270 beds, including 60 ICUs, occupied on Saturday. “We had to decline admission to about 60 patients in 24 hours. Phones of all officials continue ringing all the time, but we could not help all,” said Dr Sanjeev Kumar, the hospital’s nodal officer for Covid. Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH), however, had 136 beds vacant in the Covid ward on Saturday. “Of the 500 beds, 364 are full. The rest of 136 beds, including some with oxygen support, are vacant for Covid patients,” said Dr Satish Kumar, deputy superintendent of the hospital. All 100 beds for Covid patients at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences stood full till evening on Saturday. Its medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said some beds marked for doctors are also full. The Ruban Memorial Hospital has stopped admission of new patients for two days in a bid to “conserve oxygen”. “All 186 Covid beds are full. We have stopped admitting new patients till Monday,” hospital’s managing director Dr Satyajeet Singh said. All 119 beds at Paras HMRI were also full on Saturday. “We have created a Covid war room which will function 24 x7 to receive calls and maintain waiting list of serious Covid patients,” hospital’s regional director Dr Talat Halim said. The Ford Hospital, which has extended the number of its Covid beds from 55 to 75, also had no unoccupied bed on Saturday. “We are getting dozens of calls for beds. However, nothing can be done under the present circumstances,” hospital’s quality manager Pradeep Sharma said. The Jagdish Memorial Hospital, which has the capacity to accommodate 32 Covid patients, had to refuse admission to 65 patients in the last 24 hours. “As the short supply of oxygen still persists, we are unable to admit new patients,” hospital’s director Dr Alok Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/packed-hospitals-continue-to-turn-away-covid-19-patients/articleshow/82234653.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Locals join hands to renovate burial grounds in Nandyal||NANDYAL: A group of people from Nandyal in Kurnool district has launched a mission to renovate all Hindu burial grounds in the town. The group, comprising mostly old-timers who studied in Nandyal, has already completed the renovation of a burial ground near the RTC bus station with modern facilities. They now plan to take up similar development work in other crematoriums in the town. Moved by the plight of people in performing the final rites of their near and dear ones, particularly during the first wave of Covid-19 last year, long-time Nandyal resident M V Sivakumar Reddy moved a proposal before his friends to take up the modernisation work of the burial grounds. Though some of them expressed their willingness, some others backed out. Determined to go ahead with the initiative, Reddy, who is a senior official in the factories department, started the work in one of the areas with available resources. “We visited a few modern burial grounds located in different states, including the one constructed by Isha Foundation, before readying the blueprint for development of Nandyal burial ground,” he told STOI. After seeing the progress of the work, some local industrialists came forward to extend support to the initiative. However, the project suffered a jolt when two key people who were monitoring the works died of Covid-19 last year. With Reddy mostly away on official work, it became difficult for the other team members to convince locals to continue their support. In fact, many of them not only refused to actively monitor the works but also refused to extend financial support. “I took leave from office to convince them and managed to mobilise manpower and resources to complete the work. The work got delayed by three-four months as it was tough to convince the people involved in the project to come forward again and complete the project. I wanted it to be completed, particularly considering the second wave of the pandemic, so that the dignity is not denied to the dead and their final rites are properly conducted,” Reddy explained. He said he himself tested positive for Covid in the middle of all this but despite isolating himself at home, ensured that the work did not stop. “It was a mission for us which we wanted to complete at any cost. We have provided separate wash rooms with modern facilities, waiting lounges, cremation park, ash collection point and shelter to perform the rituals. We spent around Rs 50 lakh but the cost and effort have been worth it,” he added. Nearly 80 per cent of area in the burial ground has been turned into green belt by planting hundreds of saplings. The renovated burial ground will open on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/locals-join-hands-to-renovate-burial-grounds-in-nandyal/articleshow/82234733.cms||Samdani MN
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Cov+ report, doctor’s prescription must to rent oxygen cylinder||KOLKATA: A patient can only get oxygen cylinders if he or she has a Covid-positive report along with a doctor’s prescription that says there is a need for oxygen. The state has now mandated that these two things are necessary to procure oxygen cylinders in order to prevent hoarding and black marketing in the face of crisis. A control room is also being set up at the state secretariat — Nabanna — to co-ordinate supply of oxygen centrally. While there is already shortage of portable oxygen cylinders, hospitals are still getting uninterrupted supply of liquid medical oxygen (LMO). But the demand for LMO, too, has shot up in the last three weeks, with a high number of hospitalized patients requiring oxygen therapy. With hospitals hiking Covid bed numbers further, they are uncertain about an adequate supply in future. “Our oxygen consumption has gone up by 50% over the last two weeks. Current utilization is around 3,000 cubic metres per day against 1,900 litres per day two weeks ago. This is expected to go up further with increased flow of Covid patients into critical care,” said R Venkatesh, zonal director (east), Narayana Health. Peerless Hospital has two towers to store LMO with a capacity of 16Kl each. From an average requirement of 3Kl a day, the demand has gone up to about 5Kl a day in the past few days. “With the number of patients requiring oxygen going up, the demand, too, has risen. We expect it to increase further to about 9Kl to 10Kl a day as and when we add more beds for Covid care. Luckily, the supply so far is very regular,” said Sudipta Mitra, CEO, Peerless Hospital. Most Hospitals in the state are being supplied by Linde India and Air Water. The supply comes from three plants — Haldia, Durgapur and Jamshedpur. Suppliers said that there is no dearth of production. However, logistics, like tankers, could be a bit of a problem due to the increase demand. “There is a drastic rise — by about three times — in demand for oxygen over the past two weeks. But, so far, the supply chain is steady,” said Alok Roy, chairman, Medica Group of Hospitals Hospitals said the problem was with cycler oxygen. As most hospitals have their own LMO storage, there is no problem in supply when it comes to indoor patients. But patients who need oxygen support during transport to hospitals and smaller nursing homes that do not have storage plants are the ones undergoing the crisis. The state has already applied to the Union health minister for supply of 10% of the imported oxygen. Till 6am on Saturday, there was a need for 223MT of oxygen in Bengal. There are also plans to divert industrial oxygen for hospital use. Bengal has the capacity to produce 497MT of oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-report-docs-prescription-must-to-rent-oxygen-cylinder/articleshow/82235340.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Eight of 10 Bidhannagar vax sites shut due to shortage||KOLKATA: Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) has been hit by a shortage of vaccines. Out of its 10 vaccination centres, including seven urban primary health centres, the civic body could operate only two hospitals — Matri Sadan Hospital in EE Block and another in Rajarhat Deshbandhunagar — on Friday and Saturday. The remaining eight centres stayed shut. Civic health department officials said the primary health centres will resume work as soon as they get the next batch of vaccines. “The problem is that from nearly 200 vials, we are now receiving only about 35 vials for vaccination,” said an official. With the urban primary health centres not being able to give vaccines due to shortage, long queues have been forming at the two hospitals in Salt Lake and Rajarhat. A lot of people have even been arriving as early as 6am and waiting till the afternoon to get the shot. There has also been a massive spike in Covid numbers in the Bidhannagar area in the last month. With an average of 300 new cases every day and over 2,500 active cases at present, the civic body has urged people to strictly follow the Covid-saf-ety protocols. More than 5,000 people have been affected by Covid since the beginning of this year. The number of Covid-affected persons in Bidhannagar area since last March is close to 25,000 with 127 deaths. The civic authorities are now planning to come up with safe houses in Salt Lake and Rajarhat and are preparing to take up a sanitization drive across its 41 wards. South Dum Dum municipality, where over 100 daily cases have been getting reported in the last few days, has converted its Rabindra Bhavan complex into a 40-bed safe house and is opening more.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/8-of-10-bidhannagar-vax-sites-shut-due-to-shortage/articleshow/82235386.cms||Suman Chakraborti

It was recorded at 40.8 degrees C, three notches higher than normal for the day. Any respite from the scorching heat is unlikely over the next few days as Patna Meteorological Centre has predicted that the maximum temperature would remain in the range of 40-41 degrees C till April 30. Gaya in south Bihar was the hottest place in the state on Saturday with a maximum temperature of 42 degrees C. An officer at Patna Meteorological Centre said maximum temperature remained one to two notches higher than normal at most places in the state. The meteorologist said a cyclonic circulation was situated over central Bihar and Jharkhand. “However, absence of moisture incursion from Bay of Bengal will lead to dry weather in the state over the next two days along with rise in maximum temperature by one or two notches,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-respite-from-soaring-mercury/articleshow/82234821.cms||---
---||Patna||Calls flood helpline, telemedicine centres||PATNA: As Patna continues to battle the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, helpline and telemedicine numbers issued by the health department and the district administration have been receiving hundreds of calls from people, mostly in home isolation, seeking necessary medical care. Apart from telemedicine and counselling facilities, people are also told about the availability of beds in nearby government hospitals, testing centres and regarding vaccination on helpline and telemedicine numbers. Officials said contact numbers of oxygen cylinder suppliers and local ambulance service are available with the Covid control room of the districts for benefit of the public. A senior official at the helpline (1070) control room of the health department told TOI that specialist doctors and psychologists answer queries raised by the callers and also prescribe necessary medications to the Covid patients. “Every district has its own Covid control room number and people can make general medical queries and seek information regarding facilities at government hospitals, test centres, ambulance services and other schemes,” he said. “Phone numbers of healthcare centres in the nearby areas are also provided to the people calling on the helpline, so that they get the medical assistance on timely basis,” he added. Ankit Kumar, a tele-counsellor at Covid control room, Patna said: “People often make enquiries about the duration of Covid infection, complications and availability of vaccine along with the methods of test to be conducted for Covid.” He added that people of other districts enquire about medical facility and health advisory. “We provide contact numbers and details of nearby hospitals, ambulance services and test centres,” Amit said. Meanwhile Dr Surendra Pandit, a medical officer at the telemedicine service being provided by Patna district administration, said: “We go through patient’s reports and examine their health condition through video calls and prescribe medicine or test as per need of the patient.” Another telemedicine adviser Dr Ajay Kumar, said, “People discuss about their Covid reports and steps to be taken accordingly. We recommend home isolation or admission in nearby hospital depending upon the report and health status of the patient.” CHART: Covid helpline number (health department): 1070 Telemedicine number of Patna district administration: 0612-2508050, 6287590551, 6287590552||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/calls-flood-helpline-telemedicine-centres/articleshow/82234676.cms||---

It has also formed separate teams to stop hoarding and blackmarketing of oxygen and medicines, like Ivermectin, required for Covid treatment. “Hospitals and oxygen suppliers are requested to inform us at 03322505096/03322143644 of any movement of oxygen tankers and trucks carrying cylinders in the city so we can ensure their safe and hassle-free movement,” said joint commissioner (traffic) Santosh Pandey. The state police is also taking a similar step to ensure essential-supply trucks do not get stuck at nakas on the highway. The Enforcement Branch and detective department have also formed teams to stop blackmarketing of oxygen once it reaches the market. “We have formed an eight-member team that will visit medical stores storing cylinders and check prices. This team will also be visiting godowns to check if anyone is trying to stock up on cylinders illegally. Checks will also be carried out at Bagree Market and Mehta Building to ensure there is no hoarding of drugs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cop-teams-to-ensure-smooth-transport-of-supplies/articleshow/82235374.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Ahmedabad||No bed in their backyards, patients risk long travel for treatment||Surat/Vadodara/Ahmedabad: The dire shortage of beds and oxygen is forcing Covid-19 patients to risk travelling hundreds of kilometres away to save their lives. If patients from Saurashtra are going all the way up to Surat, Vadodara hospitals are seeing an influx of Covid-infected from Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Situation at Ahmedabad Civil Hospital is no different even as it’s become virtually impossible to get beds there. Saurashtra’s three biggest hospitals — the Pandit Deendayal Hospital (Rajkot civil hospital), Jamnagar’s GG Hospitals and Bhavnagar’s Sir T Hospital — are overwhelmed with patients not just from respective cities but from villages of other districts too. Patients who are being informed two or three days in advance by their doctors about possible oxygen requirements are packing their bags to Surat where several community isolation centres have been set up to reduce the pressure on government hospitals. Manju Koshiya (60) and her husband Kurji (65), both Covid-19 positive, were brought to the city from Nari village in Bhavnagar district, 354 kms away, after they could not find a hospital bed with oxygen supply. While the woman’s health is improving, her husband is still down with serious infection. Similarly, government officer Vipul Patel had to shift his both elder brothers to Surat from Rajkot for similar issues. “I inquired with my friends here and got them admitted owing to the difficulties in Rajkot. The facilities are better in Surat, at least for now,” Patel told TOI. Dr J P Modi, medical superintendent of Ahmedabad Civil Hospital — Gujarat's biggest Covid care hospital — said that they are witnessing an influx of patients both from outside the city and state. “We don’t have statistics, but several travel hundreds of kilometres in hope of getting one bed with a ventilator or BiPAP. We attempt to provide bed to all irrespective of their domicile,” he said. In Vadodara, three members of a family from Rajgadh in MP have come and one of them is in serious condition at the SSG Hospital while two others are in private hospitals. Minister of state for Narmada and urban housing Yogesh Patel said around 2,000 patients from outside the district are being treated in Vadodara. In PDU Hospital at Rajkot, there are 60-70 ambulances and private vehicles waiting for patients’ admission at any given time of the day while Jamnagar collector had made a fervent appeal to people not to bring patients to GG Hospital as they were already stretched beyond capacity. Geeta Chaklasiya (47) was brought to the city from Jalila village of Botad district two days ago. “Doctor told us to keep oxygen ready as she may need it anytime. We searched but couldn’t find any facility nearby and so we brought her to Surat,” said Naresh, her brother-in-law. Another 85-year-old patient Bhikha Chaklasiya too was brought to the city by his son Bharat, a textile businessman. There are at least 10 such centres having beds in the range of 20 to 50 that have been set up by various communities like Patidars, Jains, Marwadis, Ahir Samaj etc. Manish Kapadiya, a coordinator at an isolation centre set up by Samast Patidar Samaj, told TOI: “Relatives of patients requiring oxygen support are inquiring with Surat hospitals for vacant beds and once they get confirmation, they shift them. Many such patients are getting treatment in isolation centres here,” “Of the 40 patients admitted here, total 14 have been brought from Saurashtra. We are taking all types of care of these patients since they come from long distances and have limited local support,” said Abhin Kalathiya, a coordinator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-bed-in-their-backyards-patients-risk-long-travel-for-treatment/articleshow/82235650.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

Musahari police station SHO Maheshwar Mandal on Saturday said it was around 11pm on Friday when Suraj’s mother informed police that some villagers were thrashing her son. “Police went to the spot following which the matter regarding the gang rape and viral video came to light. Suraj, who was in serious condition following the thrashing, was brought to the police station and subsequently sent for treatment,” Mandal said. He said the gang-rape survivor is aged around 15 years and the incident took place at Bedaulia on April 7 when she had gone to the fields to relieve herself. “Suraj along with his associate Jyoti Kumar had allegedly raped the girl. They recorded a video of the entire incident and threatened her with dire consequences she reported the matter to anybody,” he said. Mandal said the entire matter remained in dark until recently one of the accused youths forwarded the video to the rape survivor’s uncle on Friday. “Villagers held meeting to resolved the matter. However, when the meeting failed to resolve the matter, the gang-rape survivor’s family members got hold of Suraj and thrashed him after tying up on their premises,” Mandal said. He said the gang-rape survivor lodged an FIR with the Women’s police station after which a women police team took Suraj into their custody on Saturday. The SHO said police also have collected the clipping of the video which was forwarded to the girl’s uncle. Women’s police station SHO Niru Kumari said the second accused Jyoti was still evading arrest. “The victim has made Suraj and Jyoti named accused in FIR. Suraj has been forwarded to jail on Saturday evening,” she said. She also said that raids were on to nab Jyoti — a native of Dhiran Chhapra under Bela police station area of Muzaffarpur district. “Process is on to record her statement before a judicial magistrate and get her medically examined,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/1-held-for-gang-rape-of-minor-girl/articleshow/82234815.cms||---

The incident occurred on the busy Govid Mitra Road, the medicine hub of the city, around 1pm. The victim was identified as Sanjeev Kumar Sinha (45). Police said one of Sinha’s employees, Sunny Kumar (25), was injured in the firing. The accused was identified as Sonu Gupta (35). One of Gupta’s associates who allegedly helped him in committing the crime is yet to be identified. The incident created panic in the locality and all the shops were immediately closed. SHO of Pirbahore police station Rizwan Ahmed Khan said Sinha was shot twice in the chest. “He was rushed to Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) where the doctors declared him brought dead,” he added. The SHO said Sunny, who has also received two bullet injuries in the abdominal area and chest, is undergoing treatment at PMCH in a critical condition. “Three empty cartridges were recovered from the spot,” the SHO added. City SP (central) Vinay Tiwari said the murder was probably fallout of rivalry between the two medicine traders over sale of oxygen cylinders. “Gupta has a bad temper. He often picks up fight with his customers,” the SP said. “The two accused are visible in the CCTV camera footage. Raids are on to arrest them,” Tiwari said, adding Sinha was a resident of Mainpura. Locals said Gupta had parked his bike in front of Sinha’s shop. “The two had an argument over it just half-an-hour before the incident,” they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/drug-trader-shot-over-oxygen-cylinder-row/articleshow/82234685.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Besides, the medical staff in private as well as government hospitals are witnessing more deaths of Covid-19 patients in the second wave of the pandemic and the anguish of the attendants. NMCH at Patna, the Covid dedicated hospital in the state capital, has a huge rush of patients in last few days. It has increased the workload of the medical fraternity due to the shortage of staff as several health workers have tested positive. Dr Divyanshu Martand from medicine department of NMCH said besides treating the Covid patients, they make several rounds to Covid ward and make health bulletin. “Although, we are doing duties on roster basis, our working time has increased as several doctors are under home quarantine after testing positive,” he said, adding that they live under constant fear of getting infected despite taking precautionary measures. “We are facing the wrath of the attendants as well. When the oxygen pressure was down a few days back, the attendants of a patients became violent and beat several doctors. Even when any critical patient dies, the family members hold the doctors responsible for it. There is also a shortage of required medicines,” said Dr Ramchandra Kumar, JDA president of NMCH. PMCH’s head of department of radiotherapy, Dr PN Pandit, said even though Covid protocols are followed, several doctors and nurses have tested positive. “The medical fraternity is always under constant threat of getting infected or taking the infection back home,” he said. PMCH superintendent Dr IS Thakur said around 70 doctors and 65 nurses are under home isolation after getting infected. “If more healthcare workers get infected, it will be little difficult to treat the patients at the hospital,” he said. Dr Dheeraj Kumar, resident doctor (directorate of medicine) of gastro department at IGIMS Patna said the hospital was facing shortage of beds and oxygen. “Patients or their family members demand bed and oxygen, but we are helpless as there is only 50% beds available in the health facilities against the requirement,” he said. Dr Vinay Kumar, senior resident at AIIMS-Patna said it was a big relief that they did not face shortage of oxygen. However, there was scarcity of required drugs like Fabiflu and Remdesivir among others. Besides, there is also shortage of medical staff as around 345 of them are infected with Covid. The workload has increased,” he said. He added: “Earlier in the first wave, we had to work eight days and quarantine for eight days to curb the spread of infection. In the first wave, we had four medical employees on 15 patients. Now only 3-4 health staff are looking after 60 patients because of which there is some compromise with care.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/healthcare-workers-under-stress-as-many-test-ve/articleshow/82234699.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Kolkata||Vaccine price at private hospitals to shoot up from May 1 in West Bengal||KOLKATA: Citizens aged above 45 who were getting Covid vaccines Covishield and Covaxin at Rs 250 a dose at private hospitals will have to fork out several times more from May 1. With no cap set on the price charged by private hospitals, there are fears that it could led to profiteering. The differential pricing has already received flak from Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee. The health and family welfare ministry, in a letter to the state health department, has said the system of supplying vaccine stocks to private Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) at Rs 150 per dose will cease from May 1. Even those who have received one dose of the vaccine at Rs 250 will have to pay a much higher amount. However, the government has not fixed any rate for vaccination at private hospitals. It has only stated that the CVCs have to declare the vaccine time and rate on Co-WIN. Incidentally, everyone who seeks a vaccine will still have to register on the portal. Doctors have expressed concern over the lack of regulation in pricing the vaccine that private hospitals will be able to purchase at Rs 600 per dose. They feel that the government should cap the price to prevent hospitals from profiteering. To ensure that the current vaccines procured by the Centre at Rs 150 per dose and handed out to the state for those above 45 is not used by private hospitals when the drive is extended to all adults from May 1, it has asked states to match the books and take back the leftover stock after April 30. “States need to do a complete stock taking of the funds deposited by private CVCs, vaccine doses supplied to them, vaccine doses utilized so far and doses likely to be utilized by April 30. Any unutilized vaccine stock, balance as on April 30, will have to be returned to the cold-chain point from where they were issued. The state must make a careful assessment of the potential for full utilization of such vaccine doses up to April 30 before issuing any further stock to private CVCs,” health and family welfare ministry secretary Rajesh Bhushan stated in the letter to the state health secretary. Facing criticism over a new vaccine policy that could have people paying a lot more for a Covid shot, the government put out a clarification on Saturday. It said that vaccines procured by the Centre would be provided free to states. However, the statement did not comment on the higher prices of vaccines sourced by states and private hospitals directly from the manufacturers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vaccine-price-at-pvt-hosps-to-shoot-up-from-may-1/articleshow/82235380.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Chennai||Being kings in a man’s world||Chennai: Xen Aerat’s Instagram handle is a window into her kaleidoscopic soul. It features the male, female and trans models she has done makeup for, and self-portraits that ensure you’re allowed no leeway to box her into a ‘type’. This need for society to embrace gender fluidity with curiosity and comfort is pretty much what drove her to don the drag herself about a month ago, after more than three years of conceptualising looks for drag queens and helming the backend for shows across the country. The 33-year-old makeup artist from Chennai is a drag king — artists born female who explore tropes of masculinity and androgyny on stage. They’re the underrepresented half of the art form known for its queens — those assigned male at birth, crossdressing as female on stage. Which is why Xen is among the small, but rising population of artists who aren’t just determined to usher in the much-needed diversity, but employ this gender-bending art form of exaggerated personas to express who they are — be it masculine, feminine, both, or neither. "During my years backstage, I saw artists who were born male, manifesting their female persona and those born female expressing their masculine side. My resonance with drag has always been with the way it liberates you, and because I have always been fluid in matters of identity, sexuality and spirituality, it was this core that I wanted to express," says Xen, whose first drag persona in her performance for the Mobbera Foundation’s queer festival, "expressed my most feminine side". This transformational quality of drag that allows a single performer to flow from one alter ego to another, seamlessly blending into each other, is also what drew Mumbai-based sculptor Durga Gawde. Durga’s drag is also a reflection of their own understanding of themselves, which transcends all binaries while owing up to each. "When you look at pictures of me from age 11 to 21, I had the quintessential Indian girl-next-door looks, long hair et al. However, every time I looked at myself in the mirror, it disturbed me. I just couldn’t recognise who I saw. I’d never heard of the term ‘gender fluid’ then," they told TOI. But soon after they went to study at the Rhode Island School of Design, these conflicts were put to rest in a community that acknowledged myriad gender identities. Their meeting with RANI Ko-HE-Nur (the drag avatar of model and actor Sushant Divgikar), encouraged them to explore the art form and thereafter, their own avatar, ‘Shakti’, was born, and has featured in shoots for Vogue India, Lakme Fashion Week and shows across the country in their father’s suits, as effortlessly as their favourite skater dress and heels. At Kitty Su, The Lalit Delhi’s LGBTQI-friendly nightclub where they have performed, other rising drag kings like Bidisha Mohanta (stage name Badshah Mayur), have also found their footing. "We know what gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender is, but we don’t know what gender fluid stands for and what it means. Some days, I feel like a man; other days I feel like a woman; some days both and other days, neither. This kind of shifting identity is hard to understand, as people tend to associate a human being with the face, and the way they present themselves. But the more people start presenting themselves authentically, the more others will get used to having different types of people around," she says. While even globally, the stage is just warming up to drag kings — including renowned platforms like RuPaul’s — drag traditions featuring crossdressing women have deep roots in our culture, says Patruni Chidananda Sastry, a classical dancer, researcher and founder of DragVanti, a blog and directory of Indian drag queens. "There are multiple such traditions in every state within the realm of their folk arts. In Chindu Yaksha Ganam, a dance-drama tradition from Karnataka, women dress up as men," he says. "Such impersonations are also common in ‘women-women’ set-ups. In Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, there are instances where women who are not taken as a part of the ‘baraat’ (the wedding procession), took up the ‘natka’, the folk dance tradition where they dress up as the husband and others as the wife, and narrate stories from their marital life." As far as the classical arts go, it is really the finesse in your technique that decides the roles you can pull off, rather than the gender you are born into, says Kuchipudi artist Sravya Manasa Bhogireddy. In some of her most memorable performances, Sravya has donned the Krishna ‘vesham’ or performed the Shiva Tandavam, and what drew her to these roles was the high energy in their depiction — as opposed to the softer paced aspects that fall under ‘lasyam’. "Traditionally, Kuchipudi was performed by male artists, but today, women dominate the space. This is also one of the reasons why it makes sense to have women embrace male avatars. That, and personal choice."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/being-kings-in-a-mans-world/articleshow/82235314.cms||Saranya Chakrapani

According to reports, the woman Rajkumari Gupta, (65) with an identification number JHAN0029658574 was declared dead on Friday by the hospital authorities due to Covid. As per the declaration, she was admitted to the hospital on April 23 and died on the same day. She was having a sore throat, fever and cough with breathing problems. The matter came to light on Saturday after some people contacted her relatives at her house. Later, a video clip also went viral in which Rajkumari was seen standing in the balcony of her house saying that she had recovered a week ago and was quite fit. When the TOI contacted the principal of the Jhansi medical college Dr Narendra Singh Sengar, he said that it was a matter of mistaken identity as a woman of similar name had died of Covid on late Thursday night. “The family members of the deceased entered the hospital’s ICU ward and started creating ruckus. They even manhandled the medical staff present at that time for which an FIR had been lodged. During this scuffle, the files got mingled which created this confusion”, he said. Meanwhile, six people died due to Covid while 834 new patients were reported in the district on Saturday. With this the total positive count has gone up to 21437 with 7136 active positive cases. Out of them, 603 are symptomatic. The continuous surge in the number of patients is posing a big challenge to the administration to tackle the situation amid scarcity of oxygen and beds. Those who succumbed include three women aged 69, 67, 45, years and three men aged 56, 59, 65 years. All of them were admitted in different hospitals with Covid like symptoms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/woman-declared-dead-due-to-covid-by-medical-college-found-alive/articleshow/82234856.cms||---

A board was recently put up in front of an electronics shop on Shirole Road with a contact number for customers to call if they are serious buyers. “We are not conducting business from the shop but delivering electronics items at customers’ home. Even while making the deliveries, we adhere to the restricted timings and make sure my employees are home before 8pm. Customers call and enquire about the products, and if we have them in stock, we deliver them home and accept online payment,” said the owner of a mobile phone shop. “From meetings to tuition classes, exercise sessions or social calls, everything is conducted through one’s phone or laptop. Thus, electronics should be categorised as essential items,” said a working professional in the city. A swimwear shop in Camp serves customers on an appointment-only basis. “Since delivery of non-essentials are not allowed, many customers call to find out if we can deliver swimwear home. We conduct business on WhatsApp by sending photos of various merchandise on offer and accept online payment. Quite a few customers shopped for their trips to Goa and surrounding beaches,” said an employee. “When we got a call from a client who wanted to come down to the store to pick up a few garments for her daughter’s trousseau, we jumped at the opportunity. We take a calculated risk to attend to one customer at a time and allow them to pick through our stock. It is difficult to survive for us otherwise. We have to pay the rent as well as the staff salaries,” said the owner of a boutique in Koregaon Park.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/shopowners-look-at-innovative-ways-to-conduct-business-during-strict-restrictions/articleshow/82235893.cms||---

It’s a matter of serious concern that Rs 3.5 crore of this black money was spent at Kodakara in Thrissur during campaigning. A similar incident took place in Palakkad too. These incidents reveal BJP’s attempts to undermine the elections with money power,” Vijayaraghavan said in a statement on Saturday. Vijayaraghavan said the black money was routed through hawala transactions three days before the election. It was from this money that Rs 3.5 crore was spent, allegedly by a quotation gang. There are also rumours that a section of BJP leaders worked behind the quotation gang. “According to reports, the money was brought for use in Ernakulam, Kottayam and Idukki districts. Money would have reached other parts of the state too in a similar fashion,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cpm-seeks-ec-probe-into-bjps-hawala-deals/articleshow/82235324.cms||---

Patole expressed his reservations regarding the new vaccine prices to be levied by Serum Institute of India to the Pune divisional commissioner, Saurabh Rao. He said the state should be allowed to get doses from foreign countries. The Congress leader said the Centre had given free vaccine doses to Pakistan but was not providing free doses to the people of the country.

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Man attacked with bombs, hacked to death; PSO shoots at gang, kills 1||CHENNAI: A 50-year-old businessman was hacked to death in a case of suspected business rivalry after being attacked with crude bombs inside a temple at Maraimalai Nagar on the outskirts of the city at 6.30pm on Saturday. His personal security officer, a policeman, opened fire at the gang, killing one of the assailants while the rest of the eight-member gang managed to escape. Thirumaran, a local AIADMK functionary who had survived deadly attacks twice earlier, was visiting the Arulmigu Selva Muthukumara Swamy Temple along with his wife to offer prayers on his wedding anniversary. Constable Ezhilarasan was accompanying him. According to police, Thirumaran received a call on his mobile and he walked towards the temple entrance. His wife was inside the temple. The gang, which was waiting for him, hurled a bomb at him. Thirumaran escaped from it, but the gang hit him with a second one and hacked him to death. Policeman Ezhilarasan, who rushed to protect Thirumaran, opened fire at the gang in which one of the assailants identified as Suresh, 19, of Athur in Tiruvallur district, died on the spot. Chengalpet superintendent of police Sundaravadhanam said, “The policeman opened six rounds of fire. Suresh may be a hired killer.” DIG B Shamoondeshwari, the SP and other officials visited the spot. The Maraimalai Nagar police have registered a murder case and collected CCTV camera footage from the locality. Special teams have been formed to nab the killers. As the policeman has opened fire, authorities have approached court for a magistrate probe. Thirumaran’s body has been sent to the Chengalpet GH for autopsy. Thirumaran had been offering manpower service to private companies in Chengalpet and Kancheepuram, and was also involved in real estate and iron scrap business. According to police, Thirumaran had rivalry with his former business partners Rajesh and Jagan. After he realised his life was in danger, he obtained a firearm without licence in Nagaland and kept it for his personal safety. After narrowly escaping deadly attacks near Singaperumal Koil in 2016 and another one in 2017, he got an armed PSO through court for his personal safety.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/man-attacked-with-bombs-hackedto-death-pso-shoots-at-gang-kills-1/articleshow/82235912.cms||A Selvaraj

The milestone was reached by Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) amid shortage of vaccine doses, which saw only 50 centres carrying out the immunization drive as against 150 plus centres that usually give vaccine doses. Stating that the fresh vaccine supply to Aurangabad was expected soon, health authorities appealed to citizens to undergo the Covid immunization without any hesitation. “As we are saying time and again, vaccine is an effective shield against Covid-19. The vaccine is safe and, therefore, citizens should not trust any rumour or myth. The cases of people getting infected with Covid despite vaccination are negligible in number and even such individuals recover easily from the infection due to vaccination,” AMC health officer Dr Neeta Padalkar said. As per official data, AMC has carried out 2,02,665 vaccinations so far, which include maximum 68,973 individuals between age of 45 to 60 having comorbidities, followed by 61,109 citizens above 60-year of age. It also includes 36,314 frontline workers and 36,269 healthcare workers. Meanwhile, Aurangabad district reported 1,497 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, taking the total number of active cases to 1,4254. The progressive count of Covid cases in the district has reached to 1,17,488, which include 1,00,888 cured patients and 2,346 deaths, show official data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/short-of-doses-aurangabad-still-administers-2l-vaccines/articleshow/82234300.cms||---
---||India||‘One can donate blood 28 days after taking jab’||BENGALURU: Providing clarity on the deferral period for blood donation after Covid vaccination, Dr Sunil Gupta, director of National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC) said donation can be done 28 days after the first dose. In his reply to STOI’s query, Dr Gupta said a person who is not taking the second dose immediately after completion of 28 days of the first shot can proceed with blood donation. Earlier, NBTC had issued a notification on March 5 stating, “28 days post vaccination deferral after the last dose of Covid-19 vaccination, irrespective of the type of vaccine received”. This got blood banks worried about blood shortage as from May 1 all those aged above 18 are allowed to get jabbed against SARS-CoV2. “The donation can be done 28 days after completing both the doses. However in case a person does not (immediately) take a second dose, s/he can donate blood 28 days after the first dose itself. These guidelines were interim ones, which can be revised in future based on the prevailing situation,” said Dr Gupta. When specifically asked if a volunteer can donate blood when the spacing between the vaccine doses is more than 28 days, Dr Gupta replied in the affirmative. However, an official order is yet to be issued from NBTC. “We welcome the fact NBTC seems to agree with blood donation 28 days after vaccination. Hope this ends the confusion. However, it would help if they formally clarify the same by issuing revised guidelines,” said Rajat Agarwal, co-founder, Sankalp India foundation, a network of blood banks. Indian Society of Transfusion Medicine and Indian Society of Blood Transfusion and Immuno Haematology jointly sent a letter to NBTC on Friday, seeking more clarity on the deferral period and if blood donation can be permitted between the two doses of Covid vaccination. Dr C Shivaram, a Bengaluru-based specialist in transfusion medicine and Editor, Global Journal of Transfusion Medicine, said NBTC’s official circular would further clear the air. “The government should ideally re-examine the deferral period. Blood banks across the country have sought a reduction in it. In the US, the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) has no deferral period for blood donation post vaccination, unlike India. In the UK, a seven-day deferral period has been set for the same Covishield vaccine which we are using in India,” said Dr Shivaram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/one-can-donate-blood-28-days-after-taking-jab/articleshow/82237631.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Chennai||The stained palette||Chennai: They say a picture is worth a thousand words. To artists like Saptarshi Das and Benitha Perciyal, it’s a stain that paints a million more. "To me, the stain is the art," says Chennai-based artist Perciyal, who began working with tea and coffee stains more than a decade ago. Kolkata-based Das says he started playing with the idea of using stains five years ago and has since worked with tea splatter, mud splashes and bird poop as well as gutka, paan, blood and tobacco stains. "All the stains have their own forms, texture and colours. To me they feel like an alternative form of art," says Das. Last year, he exhibited a portrait series, ‘Imposition’, using recreated splatters of gutka or chewing tobacco, inspired by the red-stained walls of Kolkata. "The portraits are meant to look like the reflection of someone spitting. For me, the portraits are about creating awareness to keep the city space clean and to discourage chewing of gutka," says Das, who is now working with bird excreta imprints as an extension of the series as well as with blood stains for his next series. Saptarshi’s small-sized works are priced between `30,000 and `80,000. To work with gutka, Das created a paste of the tobacco and water and splashed it onto his canvas, then coated it with transparent resin. Perciyal, on the other hand, layers thin rice paper and then stains them. "The stain forms differently in each layer, spreading and drying in different ways. To me, it is representative of the menstrual cycle, an indelible impression. A stain is something people don’t want to talk about. We never talk about our bodies. I wanted the stain to speak out," says Perciyal, whose upcoming exhibition titled RED in Mumbai.is on this idea. Perciyal has also stained saris using the same technique and wears them to events. While stains allow Perciyal and Das to express themselves, world over, a few artists are making a statement using mediums as diverse as chewing gum and DNA from discarded coffee cups. London-based artist Ben Wilson, for instance, has garnered fame by painting miniature pictures on pieces of discarded chewing gum that he finds on sidewalks. American artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg collected items like hair, fingernails and cigarette butts from city buses and subway cars and reconstructed them into portraits of the strangers to whom the DNA belongs. "I see stains as part of all our lives. For instance, there are some stains that cannot be removed, just like a scar, or an event that has caused an irrevocable change in us," says Perciyal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/the-stained-palette/articleshow/82235325.cms||Kamini Mathai

He directed the district collectors to complete setting up the beds on war-footing. The chief secretary directed officials to convert, wherever essential, available wards into Covid-19 wards with oxygen supported beds and ICU with ventilator facility to accommodate more patients in hospitals. He also suggested to utilise all the infrastructure and human resources available in teaching hospitals. The chief secretary held a video-conference with the district collectors, additional collectors, district medical & health officers (DMHO) and hospital superintendents on Covid-19 control measures on Saturday. The CS asked the district collectors to ensure sufficient medical oxygen supplies in all hospitals in the state. He stressed the need to judiciously utilise the oxygen, which is precious at this moment, and to ensure that not a single unit of oxygen is wasted. He said effective management of present Covid wave largely depends on effective utilisation of oxygen. The CS asked the officials to judiciously and optimally utilise the infrastructure and human resources for effective management of Covid-19 control. He directed health officials to have a triage in every hospital to effectively provide treatment based on patients’ conditions and to make optimum use of Corona Care Centers (CCC) so patients with mild symptoms can be treated at these centres. He said that no patient should be denied treatment when they come to hospitals. He directed district collectors to have a brief teleconference twice a day with DMHOs, hospital superintendents, RMOs and other concerned officials to assess the situation and strengthen the services. “Ensure that every deserving patient gets the right and timely treatment. The district collectors are empowered to draft personnel from other departments and also to recruit personnel on temporary basis, if necessary,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/12k-oxygen-beds-will-be-set-up-at-govt-hospitals-in-districts-assures-chief-secy/articleshow/82235918.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Housing societies tie up with hospitals to set up OPDs||KOLKATA: The Covid situation is such that people are scared of visiting hospitals’ out patient departments (OPDs). Even private chambers are out of bounds as many doctors are preferring to go in for tele-consulting and are not sitting at their chambers regularly. To bridge this gap, many housing societies are setting up their own clinics on campus, tying up with hospitals who are sending doctors, nurses and medical assistants to man these OPDs. These are, of course, strictly for the non-Covid patients who reside on the complex premises. While these clinics are starting with MDs, so that general check-ups can be done, routines are being set so that specialist consultants can also take turns to sit in these fully equipped clinics that will run as off-site OPDs of the hospital that has tied up with the complex. The timings and names of doctors are being shared with residents and they will be connected online with the medical assistants of these campus clinics so that appointments can be taken. Many complexes also have specialist doctors residing there. They have also shown interest in sitting in these clinics at designated hours to check on residents. They are also helping out the committees of the housing societies in co-ordinating with the hospitals to get the clinics up and running as soon as possible. At Upohar the clinic is almost ready. It’s being set up under guidance from Medica Superspecialty Hospital. “We had a spare room on the ground floor of tower 11, where drivers used to hang around. We are converting that into a fully air-conditioned and equipped clinic,” said Sudeep Ganguly, convenor of the Upohar Welfare Committee. A medical room at Urbana is getting readied for the upcoming clinic. It’s a big facility that will have specialist doctors visiting and checking patients two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening. In between doctors of medicine and resident doctors of the complex will have their ‘chamber time’. “We are working towards making it a well-equipped OPD packed with all equipments. It’s an expensive proposition and one Urbanite has pledged to donate Rs 5 lakh. We have many others contributing,” said S Ramani Iyer, treasurer of the committee. On Sunday vaccination of the residents will happen here. Last year, in several phases Apollo Hospital had set up OPD camps at Siddha Pines in New Town. “We have identified space for an OPD clinic on campus. We are approaching Apollo once again for this. Several doctors on campus are helping us with this,” said Manav Mehera, president of the committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/housing-societies-tie-up-with-hosps-to-set-up-opds/articleshow/82235330.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Hyderabad||Hawala link in hair smuggling racket||HYDERABAD: Investigating agencies have stumbled upon strong hawala links between gold smugglers of Hyderabad and human hair exporters to Myanmar. Customs officials said balance payment of undervalued exported hair is made through smuggled gold via Myanmar. “Gold is the easiest way to make payment because the yellow metal any way comes through Myanmar,” said a customs official. The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence said the exporters, who operate primarily from West Bengal and Telangana, are decreasing the value of export consignment of human hair to Myanmar, Bangladesh and Vietnam. A senior DRI official said gold smuggling from Myanmar is rampant. “It is mainly linked to Pot Market in Secunderabad, Begum Bazar and other areas. Gold smugglers are bringing gold from Myanmar via the porous borders of Manipur, Mizoram and other areas. They are exchanging it for human hair money. This entire racket has links to China,” he said. Confirming this, Srinivas, a hair exporter from Eluru, said: “Hawala money is making its way into India by way of gold. By underinvoicing, human hair smugglers are showing the price officially as $4 per kg. The actual sale price is $60. There is a difference of $56 per kg and this money is routed through hawala in the form of gold,” he said. The investigating agencies have zeroed in on some hawala operators and gold smugglers linked to human hair exporters. “Apart from gold, the operators are also using illegal online betting apps to transfer tje money. But, gold is safe for them as it is taken by local traders and cash is given back instantly,” said sources. The smuggling racket was busted after Kolkata customs officials tightened the noose on undervalued raw hair exports. Recently, an exporter and a customs clearance agent were arrested and human hair consignment cumulatively valued at Rs 9.4 crore was seized.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hawala-link-in-hair-smuggling-racket/articleshow/82235331.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Mumbai||Uncertainty makes people in their 40s seek online will-writing services||15 litres per minute. That's how much oxygen 48-year-old Vipul Randeria needed to survive September 2020. That month, when Covid hijacked his lungs, slurred his speech and froze his body, an ICU became his home for 12 long days. Here, as the father of two lay horizontal on a white bed, sucking in air from a cylinder, a long-pending decision mutated into a non-negotiable priority in his rested head. "Why now?" the sub-registrar would ask on seeing 48-year-old Randeria appear in court, along with his brother-in-law and his accountant as witnesses, to get his will registered in October 2020. And Randeria--who didn't want his sons to suffer the paperwork he and his sister did after his mother's demise--would reply matter-of-factly: "I've touched the death bed and returned. Anything can happen anytime." The desperate backdrop of Covid, it seems, has made the fragility of life so pronounced that it is slowly chipping away at a tired, old perception of will-writing in India. You don't need to be staring at an ominous X-ray or living on borrowed time to finally consider writing a will, seems to be the lesson from the virus for many who have recently sought the services of online will writing firms with the same pragmatic foresight that precedes applications for medical insurance. While a will does not need to be registered to be valid in India, it needs to be printed out and signed by the person in the presence of two witnesses for it to be legal. Among the seekers of wills in pandemic times are the septuagenarian CEO of a bank who filled the online will during quarantine by enlisting neighbours as witnesses and many people in their forties, eager to avoid passing on the messy aftertaste of property disputes in their wake. "Earlier, our majority client demographic was over 55 years of age. In the last one year, it has dropped to 45 years," says Rohan Mahajan of Lawrato.com, a legal advice platform which launched WillStar--a free online tool that helps people make their legal will--in 2018. While this three-year-old firm has received three times the average monthly numbers of enquiries in the last one year--a jump that Mahajan attributes to the "fear and uncertainty of life due to Covid"---six-year-old succession services portal WillJini has received more than 58,000 enquiries over the course of 2020. This "400% rise over 2019" owes to a sense of urgency that has overcome NRIs, senior citizen business owners and many mid-lifers such as 44-year-old Hyderabad-based techie Deepak Behera. "I think I was late," says Behera. "The pandemic made me realise that important decisions, especially ones related to financials impacting your loved ones, cannot be put off for later." Yet, Indians tend to procrastinate for various reasons. "The most common concern is they don't want to face the unpleasantness that arises among beneficiaries as more often than not, the assets are not willed to the liking of the beneficiaries, which causes rifts in families," says Mahajan. Life in a joint family meant that 51-year-old Rajesh Sharma (name changed) had front row seats to many such rifts which triggered him to "expedite" the process of making his will online recently. "I don't know if it is legal yet but at least I have taken the precaution," says Sharma, who is intimately familiar with that classic look that comes over the eyes of the elderly in his family, a look that expects you to confess "a fatal disease". Nashik-based Pradeep Talreja partly blames Bollywood for that look. "In Hindi movies, the character always gets killed or something drastic happens right after he makes a will," says the 40-year-old who recently got an online will made on behalf of his 61-year-old mother. Bitter after having run from pillar to post for documents after his father passed away a few years ago leaving a bank account without a single nominee, the will was Talreja's way of ensuring easy transfer of money between his mother's and sister's bank accounts. Many assume the will-writing process to be complex, bureaucratic and expensive. "Lawyers charge a bomb and they don't always have time to talk to you or answer your questions," says Sion-based 51-year-old Mickey Sheth who had approached several advocates, all of whom had given him different versions on the nitty-gritties of making a will. Some of them quoted upto Rs 30,000 as fees while the online service he finally opted for cost him Rs 1500, reveals Sheth, who is waiting for the city to open up so that he can get his wife's sister's signature as one of the witnesses. His 31-year-old married daughter, he says, understands his urgency, given her ringside view of an ongoing legal hassle that has her father and his two brothers wading through ambiguous inheritance laws and scrambling for succession certificates while trying to claim their deceased parents' assets even after being named as nominees. Repeating a lesson he learnt the hard way, Sheth says: "Nomination is not the same as ownership." Yet, it is one among many misconceptions that come in the way of wills achieving the same socially-acceptable popularity as life insurance in India. "Factually, a nominee is just a trustee who has to pass on the asset or wealth to the actual legal successor," says Popat, aware of the "aggressive narratives" about nomination pummelled by current laws related to succession as well as asset ownership that he believes could be misunderstood by most people. For those concerned about data leakage or misuse, though, the websites promise not only "industry standard encryption" but also alternatives in which they do not need to disclose the financial value of their assets. To bust the myriad myths shrouding will creation in India, WillJini has even come out with an ebook with FAQs in 12 Indian languages that not only clarifies that wills can be either handwritten or typed but also takes on a matronly tone while insisting that anyone over 18 years of age with a basic financial asset should make a will. Mickey Sheth, too, has to resort to this tone at weddings when near and dear ones dismiss the subject of wills as "faltu." "Nobody wants to talk about dying," says Sheth, who counters all squeamishness around wills with a simple argument: "Then, why take insurance policy even?"||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-uncertainty-makes-people-in-their-40s-seek-online-will-writing-services/articleshow/82237586.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

---||Hyderabad||Covid-19 can cause vision loss if not treated immediately: Experts||HYDERABAD: Forget soreness or redness of eyes. Covid-19 has the potential to cause ‘vision attack’, leading to blindness if not treated immediately. Cases of vision loss linked to Covid-19 and adverse reaction due to use of steroids are on the rise in the city, warn health experts. Thus far, soreness, conjunctivitis or burning of eyes have been reported in Covid-19 patients. There are instances of blurred vision too. But, of late, experts point out that instances of sudden vision attack or acute loss of vision are increasing among Covid-19 patients, particularly the elderly and those with comorbidities.. Dr P Ranganadham, senior consultant neuro-surgeon, Sunshine Hospitals, Gachibowli, told TOI that vision attack or loss of vision due to Covid-19 could be for three reasons. First, Covid-19 has a severe tendency of blocking blood vessels including those to the retina. If the supply to the retina is affected, it causes vision loss. Both arteries and veins are affected by blood clots. In case the central retinal artery is blocked, the vision loss can be restored within the golden period of first six hours. If veins are blocked (vein occlusion), the recovery is partial and slow. “The second reason could be attack by a virus called Herpes zoster ophthalmicus. Patients in ICU on ventilator and steroids are mostly affected. Steroids reduce immunity and produce painful viral lesions resulting in vision loss. The third reason is a fungal attack called mucormycosis. It is a sequelae of Covid-19 treatment. The fungus damages the bony barriers from nose to orbit, eyeballs and optic nerves,” Dr Ranganadham said. Dr Mallika Goyal, senior consultant, department of ophthalmology, Apollo Health City, Jubilee Hills, Hyderabad, said since Covid-19 is a viral infection, it can affect eyes too. “The reasons are many and include direct tissue invasion, immune dysregulation, severe inflammation, reduced oxygen to tissues, increased blood coagulability resulting in blockage of blood vessels, reduced immunity causing secondary bacterial, viral and fungal infections,” Dr Mallika told TOI. The vision is lost in one or both eyes due to clotting in central retinal artery or vein, inflammation of optic nerves that connect eye to brain, and severely raised brain pressure causing pressure on optic nerves, Dr Mallika said. According to Dr Sudhir Kumar, senior consultant neurologist, the damage to vision is also due to viral retinitis. Research studies from around the world also show loss of vision as one of the complications of the novel coronavirus. According to experts, most of the ophthalmic complications due to Covid-19 are luckily manageable if attended to immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-19-can-cause-vision-loss-if-not-treated-immediately-experts/articleshow/82235922.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Kochi||Kochi: Marayoor jaggery makers hit a sweet spot||KOCHI: As we approach World Intellectual Property Day, which falls on April 26, with the theme focusing on taking ideas to market, Kerala has a shining example of Geographical Indication (GI) benefiting the local manufacturers or farmers in marketing their products, attracting better prices. After gaining GI tag, the farm-gate price of Marayoor jaggery has grown from Rs 50 per kg to Rs 105 per kg as buyers are now willing to pay a premium for the good quality, chemical-free product from the high ranges. “Post GI tagging, farm-gate prices of filter grade-1 Marayoor jaggery has touched Rs 105 per kg for retail buyers and the prices for wholesalers is around Rs 90 per kg,” said S Indrajith, secretary, Marayoor Hills Agricultural Development Society. And various sellers are reselling this particular variety for Rs 160-170 per kg to final buyers. Till GI tagging, the Marayoor jaggery had a tough time marketing its product in the traditional market of Kerala, where it had to compete against the slightly cheaper variety flowing in from Tamil Nadu. “Earlier, the price difference between Marayoor jaggery and that coming from Tamil Nadu was Rs 10-30 per kg, depending on the season, but this has changed since the GI tagging. The price of Tamil Nadu jaggery still continues only at Rs 45 per kg, while ours have gone up,” said Selvin Mariappan, CEO of Marayoor Agriculture Producer Company (Mapco). Marayoor and Kanthalloor panchayats are home to nearly 950 sugarcane farmers who had been engaged in this vocation for generations. Between these two panchayats, they cultivate sugarcane in 1,650 acres and process the juice at 150 country sheds set up among these farms. “Marayoor jaggery is an example of how a local product could gain premium prices through GI tagging. Our IP Cell had facilitated the GI application for jaggery farmers,” said Kerala Agricultural University vice-chancellor R Chandra Babu. “We have engaged an economist to look at the opportunities for similar products to gain better prices. Recently we have also set up a centre for IPR and trade at the university to take the GI-tagged products or patents to the market,” he added. “GI registration is only one half of the overall work to be done. Once a product is IP protected, using that IP tool, we could market it better. And if we fail to protect our products, others might register it for themselves. We had seen this in the case of neem, turmeric, and basmati rice,” said Rtd Prof C R Elsy, former co-ordinator, IPR Cell of KAU, who had helped the Marayoor farmers to document and apply for GI tagging.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/marayoor-jaggery-makers-hit-a-sweet-spot/articleshow/82235335.cms||Shenoy Karun
---||Kolkata||Hep C med a boon for Cov patients||Kolkata: Virafin, a prescription drug for treatment of Hepatitis C that was approved by the Drug Controller General of India on Friday, for restricted emergency use on severe Covid patients, had undergone trials at College of Medicine & Sagore Dutta Hospital (CMSDH) in Kolkata earlier this year. Virafin is a brand of the generic drug Pegylated interferon alpha-2b or Peginterferon marketed by pharmaceutical firm Zydus Cadila. The drug was tested on about 250 patients at 25 centres in India. This includes CMSDH where the drug was administered to 10 patients with respiratory distress as a single dose injection in January and February this year. It was observed that the patients felt less need for complementary oxygen. “The drug was able to control shortness of breath and failure, which has been one of the biggest challenges so far in Covid-19 treatment,” a doctor said. “Using Virafin helps the patients recover faster and avoids complications at an advanced stage of the disease. After taking the single dose injection, patients tested Covid negative in RT-PCR in seven days in the clinical trials,” said Snehendu Koner, business development head CliniMed Life Sciences. The drug, physicians felt, could come as a boon to hospitals in cities that were hit by the oxygen crisis. With the requirement of oxygen expected to double in a fortnight, the drug could play a role in tiding over the crisis. Dr Santanu K Tripathi, director (clinical research) at John C Martin Centre for Liver Research & Investigation and member of the Standing National Committee on Medicines, said the challenge would be to make it readily available for patients who are prescribed Virafin and to ensure rational use.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hep-c-med-a-boon-for-cov-patients/articleshow/82235341.cms||---

KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran had announced on January 30 that the party would conduct ‘padayatras’ at 1,504 centres in the state with 100 workers in each yatra. But due to the second wave of the pandemic, the centenary celebrations had to be cancelled. “The legacy of INC is that it was formed by the sacrifices of prominent people from all walks of life along with ordinary people,” said Ramachandran. Though the district Congress committee planned the centenary celebration at Ottapalam on Friday, it was cancelled due to the Covid-19 serious situation, said DCC president V K Sreekandan, MP. The first full-fledged KPCC meeting was held at Ottapalam from April 23 to 26, 1921, and it was here that the call for a unified Kerala was given for the first time. ‘Andhra Kesari’ T Prakasam presided over the meeting in which 5,000 people from all parts of the state of the time — Travancore, Kochi and Malabar — participated. The secretary of the conference was advocate Perumpilavil Ramunni Menon. The editor of an independent newspaper George Joseph presided at the youth meet. Syed Muthu Sahib presided at the Khilafat meet held as part of the conference. Mahatma Gandhi visited Kozhikode in 1920 seeking support for disobedience and Khilafat movements. On January 30, 1921, the Kerala Congress unit was formed as the Kerala Provincial Congress Committee after the Indian National Congress (INC) decided to form state-level committees on linguistic basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/centenary-of-first-kpcc-meet-without-fanfare/articleshow/82235362.cms||---

He was 58 and leaves behind wife Anupama and daughter Prajakta besides a large number of relatives and friends to mourn the loss. The last rites were performed the same day at Sahakar Nagar Ghat. Shrikant was one of those rare universally-liked colleagues. To say he was quiet would be an understatement. He maintained so low a profile that it was easy to miss his presence. One hardly ever heard his voice, let alone a raised one. He was always simply but immaculately dressed. Perfectly fitting shirt neatly tucked in, trousers freshly pressed, and hair so perfectly done that not a strand was wayward. Shrikant brought the same efficiency to his work. Always punctual, always meticulous. He seemed paranoid about letting an error slip by, insisting on the mandatory spell check even if he changed one word in a headline and getting it rechecked by a fresh pair of eyes. This, even minutes before the deadline. Junior colleagues found in him a vast reservoir of information and a readiness to share that and his experience with them. With those he opened up a little, he could be funny, even mischievous. A less known aspect of Shrikant was his love for old songs, both from Hindi as well as Marathi movies. He took his time coming on social media but once he did, he delighted all with posts of lovely songs and knowledgeable comments on them. It was appropriate, then, all the colleagues young and old belted out old melodies in a brief, socially-distanced farewell held last May on his retirement. Too bad, the song was cut short.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/shrikant-pathak-ex-toi-passes-away/articleshow/82235924.cms||---
---||Goa||‘Don’t wait for test result, start treatment’||PANAJI: Experts on Saturday suggested that the treatment of symptomatic Covid-19 patients must start immediately without having to wait for the test results, as this delay only results in avoidable exposure to others, and of the patient’s condition turning critical with deferred treatment. A meeting was held with health secretary Ravi Dhawan to discuss treatment protocol to reduce infections and cut down on mortalities. Over the past few days, Goa’s mortalities have taken a jump. Several cases have come to light about patients being admitted late and in a critical condition, when doctors were unable to save their lives. “The directorate of health services has already taken action and revised the treatment protocol, which would come into force within a day or two,” a health official said. “The meeting discussed how to reduce mortalities and how to detect cases as early as possible. We suggested symptomatic patients immediately start with medication otherwise prescribed for a positive patient, and especially if he has comorbidities,” said a doctor who did not want to be named. He said that the majority of people who died of Covid-19 were diabetic, and mere home isolation is not sufficient for such patients. “Clinical assessment of such patients is necessary, and one-third of all deaths will be averted if their diabetes is treated. In Covid, a patient’s diabetes shoots out of control,” he said. Dr Shekhar Salkar, an oncologist at Manipal hospital, said that Covid care centers should be upgraded with oxygen beds, and that there needs to be a doctor to monitor the condition of patients in these centres, especially those who have comorbidities. While the directorate of health services has made it clear that it does not have doctors to spare, representatives of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Goa, will meet the health secretary on Monday. Salkar said that even after testing positive, people in home isolation eat with other members of their family, and this raises the risk of passing the infection to others though the patient may otherwise live in a separate room in the same house. “When eating, you remove your mask, so automatically, when sharing a table with a positive person, others are likely to get the infection,” he said, adding that at the care centres, any patient who displays symptoms should be shifted to hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dont-wait-for-test-result-start-treatment/articleshow/82235935.cms||---
---||Goa||Another day, another high: 1,540 fresh cases, and 17 deaths in Goa||PANAJI: The state’s active Covid-19 count shot past the 12,000-mark on Saturday after a record 1,540 new infections were reported in one day. The positivity rate continued to be 39% for the second consecutive — two in five persons test positive. Saturday also saw the death toll rise to 994, with 17 mortalities reported during the day. In just the past three days, Goa has seen over 4,000 fresh cases, with burned-out healthcare workers swamped by the ever-increasing workload. The state has seen no respite after it recorded over 900 cases in a single day last week, with Margao, Candolim, Porvorim, Mapusa, Panaji, Cortalim, Vasco and Ponda turning out to be hotspots. Margao’s caseload on Saturday crossed 1,200, while Candolim (1,042) and Porvorim (965) are other mega-hotspots. A bigger concern for the state is the ever-increasing death toll, with a daily average of 16 mortalities. The North Goa collector on Saturday declared a few buildings in Bhatlem, St. Inez, Caranzalem and Vodlembhat as micro-containment zones. On Saturday, of the 17 deaths, ten were reported from the South Goa district hospital and seven from Goa Medical College (GMC). Two died within hours of admission. Both patients were symptomatic for three days prior to reporting to hospital. Also, five of the 17 were under 50, the youngest being a 31-year-old man from Curtorim who did not suffer from any comorbid conditions. He died within 36 hours of hospitalisation. A 38-year-old man, who died after two days of treatment at South Goa district hospital, also did not have any comorbidity. The average hospital stay of 90% of those who died over the past 24 hours due to Covid-19 was less than six days. People who died were either diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or severe covid pneumonia with ARDS. Few had sepsis as well as ARDS. Health experts said that while late admission is contributing to a high mortality rate, the double-mutant strain is also proving deadlier, and could be the cause of patients turning worse faster than expected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/another-day-another-high1540-fresh-cases-and-17-deaths/articleshow/82235926.cms||---

According to official records, there are over 1.20 lakh registered workers in construction sector and another 95 lakh workers in unorganised sectors such as industries including major, medium and minor, and other mini hand-made manufacturing units in Telangana. The migrant workers’ share in both sectors is more than 60%. “Soon after Covid-19 cases were reported, the Labour Department swung into action and alerted all district authorities concerned to ensure safety of workers. All the employers of either major, medium or minor industries have to follow the‘standard operating procedure (SOP) of Covid-19 pandemic like placing sanitisers, wearing masks and maintaining social distancing at their workplaces,” joint commissioner of labour, Hyderabad, E Gangadhar told TOI. “Most of the migrant workers panicked over partial night curfew and planned to return to their hometowns. We have asked the employers, in both organised and unorganised sectors, to provide shelter and also food arrangements, so that ongoing works, either construction activity or production in industries is not affected,” added the official. Recently, the Labour Department also constituted Telangana State Social Security Board for Unorganised Workers (TSSSBUW) to register all the workers of unorganised sector. “We have also decided to follow Covid norms in these sectors to avoid spreading of viru,” added Gangadhar, administrative officer of TSSSBUW.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/labour-dept-directs-industries-to-ensure-safety-of-all-workers/articleshow/82235970.cms||Sunil Mungara

An Amsterdam-based organisation ‘BYCS’, which promotes use of bicycles in cities, has appointed Selvan Santhana as ‘bicycle mayor’ of Hyderabad to impress upon people the need to use bicycles. “Global warming is a serious concern. The carbon footprint and carbon emissions should be reduced. The actions of individuals matter in tackling this. Using a bicycle is one way of saying that you care for the environment,” Selvan said. Selvan points out that if only people inculcate in themselves the habit of using a bicycle to ride to any of their frequented destinations around 5 km from their residence, that would matter a lot. “It is not about which bicycle you ride. It can be any bicycle, including the simple bicycle that is easily available at an economic cost,” Selvan said. The ‘bicycle mayor’ is formulating a plan to seek assistance of the government. The stretch from Secunderabad to Hi-Tec City, Gachibowli, Madhapur, Kondapur, Jubilee Hills and Kukatpally areas is what he is looking at to ask the government to make them bicycle-friendly. “A exclusive lane earmarked for only those using a bicycle will be necessary,” he said. Some other cities in India also have ‘bicycle mayors’ and they are also involved in encouraging people to use bicycles. There are ‘bicycle mayors’ for Mumbai, Jaipur, Guwahati, Bengaluru and Vadodara. There are a few thousand people who use a bicycle as a hobby or for fitness in the city. “We make sure we take out our bicycles and ride for at least a few kilometres everyday,” said Ravi Sambari, a cycling enthusiast. Selvan, who lives in Madhapur and works as a global programme manager for an MNC, is also keen on talking to Hyderabad Metro Rail authorities to allow bicycles to be carried inside the train. “Someone who wants to use only a bicycle to ride to office can take the Metro if necessary and get down at any station and ride for work,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyds-first-bicycle-mayor-seeks-exclusive-lanes/articleshow/82235339.cms||---

Since more than two years, the locals have been facing severe problems commuting as neither the GHMC nor Army officials had taken up the responsibility to repair the road, which has developed multiple craters. “We got information from the local Army authorities that they themselves are going to take up road relaying works shortly. They also said that a written communication was sent to GHMC, but we are yet to receive it. The long pending problems of motorists are finally going to be solved,’’ GHMC superintendent engineer (Secunderabad) Anil Raj told STOI. In the last two years, both the GHMC and the Army literally disowned the road and kept blaming each other, citing jurisdiction issues. After several rounds of meetings between the Army and GHMC officials, it was decided that though the area comes under the GHMC limits, the 2km road stretch belonged to Army. Malkajgiri MLA M Hanumantha Rao faced several protests from the local residents for his inaction. Subsequently, the local Army authorities wrote to Indian Army, Delhi, to issue a no objection certificate to permit the GHMC to take up recarpeting of the road. “However, the Army has decided to take up the works by itself,” Anil Raj said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/army-to-take-up-road-repair-after-2-yrs-of-wrangling-with-ghmc/articleshow/82235367.cms||---

The college at Sethurapatti has been equipped with the facilities to accommodate 550 Covid-19 asymptomatic patients under 50 years of age. As of Friday night, the CCC housed over 370 patients. While a group of them protested about the quantity of food, some raised allegations of ‘inferior’ quality of food. Though the block development officer (BDO) of Manikandam block Manoharan intervened and tried to pacify them, the patients went ahead with their demonstrations. Official sources said tiffin such as chapathi, idly, pongal and idiyappan being provided for breakfast and dinner were small portions for those with bigger appetites. The lunch however did not have any complaints related to quantity. Lunch mostly includes vegetarian meals with boiled egg on six days and chicken biryani on Wednesdays. An officer said the food items were packed according to the number of patients and each person is expected to take only one pack. However, some patients were said to take more than one packet resulting in a shortage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/patients-complain-about-food-at-ccc/articleshow/82235964.cms||---

On Saturday, during a virtual address to the citizens of Goa, Sawant said, “Under the PM Cares Fund, the Prime Minister has granted permission for setting up two oxygen plants in Goa. We have taken care in order to avoid shortage of oxygen in the state.” He called upon those who have recovered from Covid-19 to donate plasma, and said the government is willing to extend all help to the donors. He said that new treatment protocol for Covid management has been finalised after a meeting with doctors, and the same would be conveyed to Indian Medical Association (IMA) Goa doctors. The chief minister stated that all facilities for Covid management would be made available to the public at GMC, both district hospitals and the sub-district hospital at Ponda. “From testing to hospitalisation, all facilities are available with the government, and I urge people to go for testing,” he said. However, he said that the health services staff are stressed and urged the people not to behave rudely. While pointing out that three to four people are brought dead daily and as many Covid patients die within 24 hours of hospitalisation, Sawant said that “this is because they are shifted to hospitals when it is too late”. “I request people to get hospitalised immediately after they get symptoms,” he said. Reiterating that a lockdown is not a solution in tackling the pandemic, and that the state has imposed restrictions including night curfew, Sawant said, “Lot of people criticise the government, including opposition MLAs. Instead of criticizing, they should give suggestions. We welcome their suggestions.” Sawant said that coronavius will continue to remain in the state for some more time and that is the reason the state has not stopped any economic activities. “Economic activities should continue in the state, and because of that we have not stopped the tourism industry, pharmaceutical industry, etc. Last year we have seen how people and the state had to suffer financially due to the lockdown. Lot of people have lost jobs,” the chief minister said. Stating that only 50 per cent of those above 45 years of age have so far taken the vaccination, Sawant urged the people to support the state government in its Covid management initiatives. He said those in the 18-45 age group having chronic diseases should consult their doctors before taking the vaccination, from May 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-to-set-up-two-oxygen-plants-to-boost-supply-in-state/articleshow/82235966.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Schools start Covid counselling periods during online classes||KOLKATA: The new academic year has started in schools at a time when the second wave of Covid has peaked and schools are doing everything in their power to sensitize kids about the dangers unless they take adequate safety measures. In almost every school, a separate slot has been kept for Covid counselling, and often this is being done in the period that students have with their class teachers. Right from the primary level to plus-II, such counselling is being done with the help of graded, colourful material, that encourages participation from kids. Times ViewStudents need all the help they can get. The second surge of the disease and the consequent change of plans has hit many of them hard. But teachers, too, have had it tough and school managements need to keep that in mind as well.At South Point School, Covid counselling starts from Monday. Teachers have prepared age appropriate power point presentations titled, Combating Covid. “There are strict do’s and don’ts that they are being told to follow and teachers will make them repeat these in the junior classes. In the senior classes teachers will encourage children to talk about the role each can play to fight Corona, including how they can start counselling adults around them,” said Krishna Damani, spokesperson. Some schools like Indus Valley World School, are not only harping on the protocols but are also doing creative classes where each child in an online class is asked to share using a particular learning tool, what can be done to strengthen one’s immune system. “Some beautiful answers came in and we posted them on our wall,” said director, Amita Prasad. “Mask wearing, frequent hand washing/sanitising and staying indoors are a daily must even at home otherwise it will be difficult to get children develop the habit,” reasoned Loreto Convent Entally principal Jessica Gomes Surana.  Children are scared and are showing signs of stress and nervousness since they are into another year of online classes. “Along with safety counselling we are trying to keep them cheerful, telling them that if we are careful we will win over the disease,” said DPS vice principal, Indrani Chattopadhyay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/schools-start-covid-counselling-periods-during-online-classes/articleshow/82235378.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Justice K Lakshman will hear their pleas on Monday.

---||Mumbai||Fire audit raises alarm at 31% Mumbai hosps, 93% in Maharashtra||Mumbai: A preliminary fire audit by public health department revealed that out of 506 hospitals directly under its control, there were serious deficiencies in 470, while BMC found that out of 1,517 hospitals in Mumbai, all is not well at 481 hospitals. A senior public health department official said following the death of 10 newborn babies at Bhandara civil hospital on January 10, 2021, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had ordered a high-level probe and sought a fire audit of hospitals in a time-bound period. “In fact, fire audits are a routine exercise, but very rarely done seriously. Several reports are submitted, but rarely is stern action taken against erring hospitals. Out of 506 hospitals directly controlled by public health department, we completed an audit of 470. At most hospitals, there are serious deficiencies,’’ he said. The officials said a list of deficiencies has been submitted to public health department for compliance. “The public works department must comply with the deficiencies in a time-bound period. We estimate it will cost at least Rs 150 crore to remove deficiencies. Funds will not be a problem, as ample funds are available at the disposal of the district collector. Is will be difficult as most hospital buildings are very old, where there are no proper entry/exit points,’’ he said. The official said at most government hospitals, there are no proper sprinkling systems, fire extinguishers are outdated, and fire hydrants and fire alarms are not functional. “Also, such a situation exists ever since most hospitals were constructed,’’ he said. A BMC official said following fires in hospitals here, a thorough audit was conducted at 1,517 hospitals, of which serious deficiencies were found in 481. “We have served them show-cause notices. If they fail to comply with directions, we will take stern action against them and we will not hesitate to cancel their licences,’’ he said. Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said the government must draft a time-bound plan for a fire audit of all hospitals in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/fire-audit-raises-alarm-at-31-mumbai-hosps-93-in-maharashtra/articleshow/82236820.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Hingna, Saoner students allotted Civil Lines CBSE school||Nagpur: Even though distance from school is one of the biggest criteria for free RTE admissions, shockingly students from as far as Saoner and Hingna were allotted seats at a very popular CBSE school in Civil Lines. RTE seat allotment is done completely by the state government through its online admission software and schools have no role to play in it. Considering the popularity of the school, it’s impossible for students from outside Nagpur city to get admission as the waiting list for city students itself is very long. Mohd Shahid Sharif, founder of social organization RTE Action Committee, said, “The software is flawed, that’s the simple truth. If we look at the selection letter which the students got, their residential address is clearly mentioned as Saoner and Hingna. In such a popular school, your chances of admission are virtually nil if you live outside a 3km radius.” This is not the first time that Sharif has questioned the integrity of the admission software, which was developed by government’s National Informatics Centre (NIC). Sharif said, “It’s a software glitch and now admission will obviously be cancelled for these students. But the question remains how come the software’s algorithm did not pick up on the address input. I have always pointed out the error in marking the address in this software and now it’s time to take serious action.” Sharif said the problem has always been with marking address while filling the online application at the initial stage. “While filling address details in the application form, Google Map also opens up and the applicant has to place the balloon marker at their residential address. We have noticed multiple errors by the software in recognizing this marker. Now, we will proceed with a public interest litigation against this mismanagement,” said Sharif. District education officer Chintaman Vanjari could not be reached for a comment on the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hingna-saoner-students-allotted-civil-lines-cbse-school/articleshow/82235971.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Hyderabad||Fire safety norms: HC junks plea of defiant colleges||Hyderabad: The Telangana high court has disapproved of the dodging ways of the private junior colleges, Chaitanya, Narayana, Vaishnavi Academy, Gautami, and others which have miserably failed to ensure fire safety in their college buildings and imposed costs of Rs 25,000 on each of them for preferring frivolous petitions. The bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy, while dismissing the petitions filed by these errant junior colleges, found fault with them for not complying with fire safety norms. The state intermediate board issued notices to several junior colleges asking them to make their college buildings fire compliant or to close shop. While some colleges have promptly complied with the norm as this involves the safety of children, some others have approached the courts seeking permission from the court to continue running colleges in the dangerous buildings. The bench went through the pleas and heard their arguments along with the argument of the intermediate board, and later dismissed the pleas of the non-compliant colleges. Upholding the validity of the orders of the intermediate board, the bench said that those orders do not warrant any interference by the court. Colleges refusing to keep their buildings safe were asked to mend their ways. Making it clear that it will not tolerate complacence in such matters, it imposed costs of Rs 25,000 on each of the defiant colleges and asked them to deposit it with the state legal services authority in two weeks. The colleges were directed to place the proof of payment with the court registry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fire-safety-norms-hc-junks-plea-of-defiant-colleges/articleshow/82235377.cms||---

The bamboo vendor, Somnath Suryavanshi (42), from Gadital has registered an FIR with the Hadapsar police. Suryavanshi had rented one guntha plot (10m x 10m) on Manjari Road from the landowner, Arun Krishna Sungir, around two months back. He had constructed a shed for storing the material. “The suspect torched the bamboo sticks, tiles and ladders around 4.30am and fled the scene,” Suryavanshi stated in his FIR. The complainant rushed to the spot after one of the neighbours informed him about the fire. Suryavanshi doused the fire by 6.30am with the help of the neighbours. “Images of plot owner Sungir’s relative pouring some chemical before torching the bamboo sticks and other material were captured in the CCTV camera at the plot,” assistant inspector Vikas Raut said on Saturday. Raut said, “There is no dispute between the plot owner and his tenant (bamboo vendor) over the not payment of the rent. But the plot owner’s relative has time and again asked Suryavanshi to evict the premises, but in vain.” “We have registered an FIR under Section 435 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to cause damage) of the Indian Penal Code,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/plot-owners-relative-booked-for-torching-bamboo-sticks-other-goods/articleshow/82235983.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: No admission yet at Dhanvantari Covid Hospital||AHMEDABAD: Ajit Parmar, a resident of Mehsana district, was distraught outside Dhanvantari Covid Hospital on Saturday morning. “My uncle is serious and he needs a ventilatory bed urgently,” said the youth. “We have tried six nearby districts for securing a bed, but nothing has worked so far. We had learnt about this new facility in the city, and were sure that we would be able to get a bed,” said Parmar, who had come with two relatives. But he and hundreds like him had to go back as the facility at Gujarat University Convention Centre near Helmet Crossroads in the city could not admit any patients on Saturday. Sources close to the development said that the facility — under construction on war footing by DRDO and local authorities — is still testing and finalizing its oxygen supply. “The work on a tank near the hall is going on. The work would continue even during the night hours. The authorities are committed to start it as soon as possible, but it’s unlikely that the entire facility would be opened in a go – it would be a phase-wise operation,” said an official close to the development. A senior official told TOI that it would only be a referral hospital. “One would be admitted only when he or she is referred by a hospital or EMRI108 service. We request citizens not to approach the hospital directly,” said the official. What irked the citizens was lack of answers for their questions. Rupa Panchal, who had come to admit her brother under home isolation for past three days in Ranip area, said that only police personnel were talking to scores of visitors. “It would have helped if the authorities had communicated the mode of admission and possible date of making the facility operational. In times when Covid beds are not available elsewhere, people came with lot of hopes,” she said. Sources close to the development said that EMRI is intimated about the new facility, but they would not be able to send the ambulances till the hospital give a green signal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-admission-yet-at-dhanvantari/articleshow/82236880.cms||---

The oxygen plant at Hindu Rao supplies piped oxygen to 100 beds, which is shared with another 100 patients.  As the requirement for beds mounts at the hospitals, the civic agency decided to use Rajan Babu Hospital, where the plant can supply oxygen to 22-24 beds, which is shared between two patients. Delhi government on Saturday allowed the facility to operate with 60 beds. आज निगम कमिश्नर श्री संजय गोयल और वरिष्ठ स्वास्थ्य अधिकारियों के साथ किंग्सवे कैंप स्थित RBPIMT का दौरा किया। कोविड… https://t.co/l1TdXnES9b— Jai Prakash (@JPBhaiBJP) 1619253955000Mayor Jai Prakash with the commissioner, Sanjay Goel, reviewed the preparation at the facility. “Due to increasing Covid cases in Delhi, we have decided to open this facility, which will initially have 50 beds and go up to 100 later,” said the mayor. He added that officers had been directed to arrange separate waiting rooms, helpdesks, water coolers and kadha for the attendants of the Covid patients. “We have formed teams, appointed nodal officers and fixed responsibility among staff for doing different jobs. Since the health workers and doctors are not acquainted with the requirement of Covid ward at the new facility, we have called doctors from Hindu Rao to train the staff for the first few days,” the mayor added. Claiming that the second Covid hospital came up in just 10 days, the corporation commissioner said, “We are also working on a third facility at Balak Ram Hospital where we plan to set up a 100-bed facility after getting the government’s approval. There will be no oxygen facility there, but people who don’t have space for isolation can stay here. They will be supervised by doctors and given all the other facilities. It will be open for public in the next 2-3 days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/north-corpn-ready-to-open-50-bed-facility/articleshow/82235982.cms||Vibha Sharma

Locals have sought the civic body and state highways department to clear permanent and temporary encroachments sans political interference. There is traffic congestion on arterial roads quite frequently even without movement of school and college vehicles during peak hours. One of the main reasons blamed for traffic snarls is encroachment of roads for commercial use. Most of the shops are using the space outside their shops to display the products, thereby eating up parking space . As there is no parking space, visitors park their vehicles on the roads itself. “If Trichy Corporation can expedite tax collection, why not the same to give relief for motorists by evicting long standing encroachments?,” said H Ubaidullah, member of Trichy Intra-City Development Endeavours. Thanjavur main road passing through Gandhi market, Madurai road passing through Thennur and Quaid E Millet road near Palakkarai, all of which are maintained by the state highways department, are frequently encroached by traders. Similarly, East Boulevard road, Big Bazaar street and Heber road, maintained by the corporation, have both permanent and temporary encroachments, however the authorities are hesitating to retrieve the public space. Both the state highways and Trichy Corporation are yet to take a call on removing the encroachments. “We have issued notices to the encroachers near Gandhi market and soon conduct an eviction drive,” an official source with the state highways said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corpn-yet-to-intensify-drive-against-encroachments/articleshow/82235981.cms||Deepak Karthik

Giridhar Sriperumbudur or Gary Budoor as he is known as in the United States was elected from ward IV and sworn in at a ceremony on April 21. “I could connect to the voters because of the social work I engaged in over the years,” 50-year-old Giridhar told STOI. There were four contestants in the fray from the ward and the IT professional won against the incumbent. Giridhar, who grew up in Karimnagar and got his master’s degree in computer applications from Princeton College in Hyderabad, went to the US in 1998. He lived in various US cities, including New York and California, and since 2004, has been living in St Louis, the second largest city in Missouri. Giridhar adopted three stretches of highways and ensured that they were well maintained. Giridhar’s parents live in Nizampet, Hyderabad.  “My election to the council calls for more responsibility. The city council will have to see that public funds are spent well and for proper purposes. Knowing the needs and the priorities well, I will be able to contribute well in serving the people,” Giridhar said. During the campaign, Giridhar and his team covered 1,700 houses explaining to families what he was standing for. The focus was primarily on three things. He said he would fight to ensure adequate funding for first responders and that he would stand against special interest groups ‘who want to undermine our safety by defunding the police.’ He said he would ensure that the city sticks to a responsible budget by eliminating waste and fraud. He also said there would be priority for job creation. The connect with the voter was not difficult because for five years, he had served as director of community services for a non-profit organisation. He coordinated community outreach and volunteer opportunities for education. He also received an award from Missouri governor Michael L Parson for his community service initiatives in 2019. He also received the President’s Volunteer Service Gold Award three times for completing 500 hours of community service within a year. Giridhar maintains a strong bond with his family back home in Hyderabad. “I could not come to Hyderabad because of the Covid-19 situation but I am yearning for a visit,” Giridhar, who lives with his wife and two children in Chesterfield, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/techie-from-t-gets-elected-to-city-council-in-us-missouri/articleshow/82235383.cms||---

The forest department found the bodies of first body on April 22, and the second one within 24 hours on April 23. Atindra Katti, the honorary wildlife warden for Nanded, on Saturday said a 55-year old local resident, identified as Prakash Jaganlal Jayawal, has been detained in connection with the poisoning. “Both the cubs were siblings and were about a year old. The body of a male cub was first found in a sorghum field in the Wai-Bajar village on the morning of April 22. His female sibling was found by the night of April 23,” he said. Katti said the accused, in his statement during the inquiry, admitted that he had poisoned the leopards. “There had been a cattle-kill incident in the farm of the accused — allegedly by one or more leopards. The wild animals had not devoured the dead cattle completely. The accused then poisoned the remaining carcass and deliberately put it out. The cubs must have died after eating the poisoned meat,” he said, adding that poison was also recovered from Jayawal’s home. The accused, who has been sent to four-day forest department custody (till April 26) by the local court, could face seven-year imprisonment if found guilty. Leopards are classified as ‘near threatened’ on the IUCN red list of threatened species and are listed under the schedule-I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. “The rural population must understand that the forest department awards due compensation if their livestock is killed in an attack by wild animals. The leopards and other wild creatures stray into human habitats due to animal-man conflict and it is a heinous crime to eliminate them, ” Katti said Earlier, two young leopards had died due to poisoning within the Kinwat tehsil limits of Nanded district in April 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/2-leopard-cubs-poisoned-in-nanded-suspect-detained/articleshow/82234333.cms||Prasad Joshi

---||Delhi||Delhi: Forest department allows felling of 200 dead trees for wood||NEW DELHI: With the spike in Covid deaths, the demand for wood for cremation has gone up in the national capital. The forest department has granted permission to South Delhi Municipal Corporation to chop nearly 200 standing dead or dry trees for utilising the wood for cremations. Forest officials said they had earlier given the nod to cut down one or two standing dead trees, but this was the first time when permission has been granted to cut such a large number of dry trees. An SDMC official claimed they had written to the forest department for permission to cut old and dead trees at parks, internal lanes and other areas, but no reply was received. “Recently, we pursued the matter with the department again because demand for wood started increasing in the wake of Covid deaths. As per norms, the wood collected after the cutting of trees is used for cremation purpose only. In fact, we are also buying or looking for other means to arrange the stock to meet the requirement,” he added. Deputy conservator of forests (South) Amit Anand said, “On the request of SDMC, we have given permission to fell around 200 standing dead or dry trees at different locations. As these are dry trees, there is no issue in their felling. The wood from such dead or dry trees will be used in cremation.” The forest department said SDMC has been directed to do compensatory plantation in the place of dead or dry trees. “We have directed the civic body to plant a sapling in the same place from where standing dead or dry trees will be felled,” Anand added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/forest-dept-allows-felling-of-200-dead-trees-for-wood/articleshow/82235990.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Trichy||On lockdown-eve, business as usual in markets||Trichy: With a complete lockdown scheduled to come into effect on Sundays during which all shops shall remain shut, people on Saturday thronged markets and meat stalls for urgent purchases. But most cities across the state did not witness any alarming crowds in the markets. Compared to the situation last year when the lockdown was clamped for the first time to combat Covid19, instigating panic purchase and chaos in the commercial streets, people and traders appeared more calm and composed on the eve of the first complete lockdown of 2021. With fish markets and meat stalls doing at least 50% of their weekly business on Sundays, fish and meat vendors extended their sales on Saturday evening till 9 pm. Many people bought meat in the evening instead of thronging the markets in the morning. “Unlike last year’s panic purchase, people did not crowd the market much, the footfall was average for a Saturday,” T Ashok Kumar, a fish vendor in Trichy said. With the experience of last year still vivid when many vegetable traders overstocked their wares only to dump the unsold stuff, traders seemed vigilant this time around. Apart from their experience in handling the lockdowns for a year now, the purchasers also seemed more austere, perhaps to cope with the looming uncertainties. Thus there was no mad rush visible at the last minute. On Sundays, the fish market sells close to 50 MT of seafood, but on Saturday, the wholesale and retail vendors together managed to sell only around 30MT. However, the market remained crowded on Saturday. The vendors argued that people are buying in lesser quantities as part of their austerity measures. Trichy’s Gandhi market, the vegetable hub of the city, remained crowded too. “Last year, when there was complete lockdown on Sundays, Saturdays saw some decent business. But this year, the sales were poor even as we reduced the price of meat. We have also planned to sell meat till 9 pm,” B Nagaraj, a chicken stall owner from Bhima Nagar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/on-lockdown-eve-business-as-usual-in-markets/articleshow/82235984.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Pune||Covaxin stirs nearly recovery-level antibodies||Pune: Antibody levels in Covaxin recipients — given both doses — more or less matched quantities that were generated by those (unvaccinated) who recovered after being sickened by newer virus variants, a study by the National Institute of Virology (NIV) has found. Samples drawn from 146 Covid-19 cases were studied by the NIV; 15 of these samples had the variant with the double mutation — the B.1.617 (believed to be the one causing the Covid surge in the state). Bharat Biotech, which manufactures Covaxin, and the Indian Council of Medical Research were also part of the latest study. A scientist with the NIV said, “Serum samples were collected from recovered Covid patients who were infected with known SARS-CoV-2 versions out of South Africa and Brazil and those with the D614G mutation. The neutralization efficacy in these samples was tested against the double mutant or B.1.617. Serum samples of Covaxin recipients were also tested against this variant. After a comparison, we found that the neutralizing antibody levels in both types of serum samples were almost the same. This demonstrates that Covaxin can have the same ability in neutralizing the B.1.617 variant as that found in the serum of recovered Covid patients.” Dr Samiran Panda, head of the ICMR’s epidemiology and communicable diseases division, said, “The mean antibody concentration in serum samples from a group of people who were earlier infected was almost similar to the mean antibody concentration in the samples of those vaccinated with Covaxin. These samples were effective against the double mutant. Therefore, instead of panicking, more people should get themselves vaccinated.” The study noted a slight drop in neutralization activity of Covaxin against the B.1.617 variant. It stated, “Similar results have been observed with serum samples of those who vaccinated with the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine, which had effectively neutralized the UK and P.1 (Brazil) variants equally. But neutralization of B.1.351 (South African) variant was reduced in case of this vaccine as well, though found to be robust. The study said that despite a drop in neutralizing capacity, the vaccines worked. The research also said that symptomatic cases in the study had mild upper respiratory tract infection with low-grade fever, cough, and sore throat. Fortunately, none of the cases developed severe disease and went on to recover completely. “But the new variant has been associated with enhanced infectivity, transmissibility and immune-escape ability. The two mutations — E484Q and L452R—in the variant might enhance the transmissibility of the virus. But we need more studies on this,” the NIV scientist said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covaxin-stirs-nearly-recovery-level-antibodies/articleshow/82235989.cms||Neha Madaan

The contractors are pushing hard before the MC to implement the hourly charges. The civic body wants all key smart features installed first. The delay is causing losses to the contractors. They had taken the lots by paying a huge amount. The MC had auctioned two parking zones for over Rs 10 crore annually. The MC had recently held a meeting with representatives of the contractors. They informed about their financial losses and other issues. But focusing on the terms and conditions of the contract, the MC asked them to install all the smart features. The engineering department had served notices for not equipping the parking lots with the smart features. Earlier, the contractors were taking the plea that they were not getting the raw material owing to the Covid-19 outbreak and restrictions. In the last inspection held almost a month back, some of the features were missing. Senior officers will take the final decision after the latest inspection report. Sources in the MC said the plea of the contractors appears genuine, but the general house will take the final call.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-to-inspect-parking-lots-next-week/articleshow/82233485.cms||Deepak Yadav

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: 7-fold surge in corona medicine demand||AHMEDABAD: A steep surge in Covid-19 cases has caused a near sevenfold jump in the demand for medicines related with treatment for the viral infection. Estimates by Federation of Gujarat State Chemists and Druggists Association (FGSCDA) suggest that stock of medicines such as favipiravir, vitamin C and zinc supplements, in addition to anti-infectives and other medicines used in Covid treatment is leaving shelves empty every single day. Alpesh Patel, president, FGSCDA, said, “Stock of Covid-related medicines, which used to last us at least a week, is now getting sold out in a single day. This surge is visible since the past three weeks. Initially, the demand and stock situation only for favipiravir was critical, but now the same holds true for zinc and vitamin C supplements, and injectables such as methylprednisolone, ulinastin and anti-infectives such as ivermectin too.” Smaller centres have already begun facing a shortage in supply. The situation at affordable medical stores is no different too. “The stock of these medicines barely lasts us for a day. Earlier, we placed stock replacement requests once in a week and now we place orders for a week. In a week, we sold an average of 1,000 strips of favipiravir, 4,500 strips of zinc supplements on an average. Availability of cough syrups too is becoming an issue,” said Ankur Aggarwal, founder, Medkart. Chemists suggest that pipeline stocks are completely exhausted. “The surge in cases is so high that the pipeline stock or buffer stock is completely exhausted. Whatever we procure is sold out in a day. If such a situation continues to remain, we will be unable to fulfil timely order requirements,” said the manager of a medical store in Prahladnagar area of Ahmedabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/7-fold-surge-in-corona-medicine-demand/articleshow/82236886.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: In Covid times, parties focus on slums||KOLKATA: With the second Covid wave lashing the city, political parties are worried about the response from middle and upper-middle class voters residing at high-rises. They are now eyeing the urban poor for support and looking to mobilise voters in slums in Rashbehari, Bhowanipore, Ballygunge and Port, which go to vote on Monday . The Trinamool Congress said they have formed three different committees at each of the booths. “While one committee is limited to the booth agents and booth relievers, the second will be those who will set up the booth level party camps. A third group will be working in close proximity to this camp group and identify the voters who need to be taken to the booths. The idea is to ensure that votes in these areas are cast by the first half. This will also serve the purpose of keeping polling booths comparatively empty so that those residing in apartments can come later and vote peacefully,” said a TMC leader at Rashbehari. At Rashbehari, ward numbers 81, 83, 86 and 90 with Durgapur Bridge Colony, Panchanantala slum, Garcha and Matharbasti remain their main targets. The third group — charged with bringing the voters to the booth — have been further given time slots so that they could bring their respective voters to the booth to stop overcrowding. The BJP, similarly, is spending a lot of time at Pyarabagan basti where it has managed to find some grasp. “It is equally important that our voters do not come under the threat of the ruling party. For those residing at apartments, we have told them that every possible safety measure must be taken to ensure that Covid-19 stays away from the polling booths,” said a mandal president. Enthusiasm is hard to miss at two slums located at Ballygunge and Chetla. “We have always voted in large numbers. We have around 6,000 voters at Peyarabagan and its adjoining slums. Unlike the ‘bhadralok’ Kolkata, which votes early and in isolation, we prefer to celebrate the day. We vote late and in groups,” said Raja Sen, standing outside the Ballygunge police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/in-covid-times-parties-focus-on-slums/articleshow/82235402.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

A communique from the Army said 384 labourers working with the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) in the area had been rescued. Six of them were critical. There were 430 labourers in two BRO camps in the area which were hit by the avalanche. “The incident took place around 4 pm on Friday when an avalanche hit a location about 4 km ahead of Sumna on Sumna - Rimkhim road in Uttarakhand. This is on Joshimath - Malari- Girthidobla - Sumna- Rimkhim axis. A BRO detachment and two labour camps exist nearby for road construction work along this axis. An Army camp is located 3 km from Sumna. The area has experienced heavy rains and snow since the last five days which is still continuing,” the communique said. According to army officials, Border Road Task Force (BRTF) teams from Joshimath were working to clear slides enroute from Bhapkund to Sumna and it was expected to take some more time to clear the complete axis since rains and pressure winds were disrupting the rescue and road clearing operations. A BRO official from Joshimath told TOI that four choppers along with an avalanche-sniffer dog and several rescue personnel were on the ground, involved in rescue work. National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) teams were assisting the Army and ITBP in clearing the snow-laden route leading up to the area. Chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat also held an aerial inspection of Sumna and adjoining areas on Saturday to take stock of the situation. He said that he spoken with home minister Amit Shah who has assured him of the required assistance in the rescue and relief operations. ITBP PRO Vivek Pandey told TOI that the ITBP camps in the area were safe. Geologists, meanwhile, were of the opinion that the avalanche may not have been triggered by a glacier burst. MPS Bisht, director of Uttarakhand Space Application Centre (USAC) said that according to initial reports accessed by USAC, the avalanche may have occurred due to heavy snowfall. In a similar vein, Kalachand Sain, director of Doon-based Wadia Institute of Himalayan Glaciology said that a snow avalanche was possible in the area but there was very little possibility of it occurring due to glacier break. Bisht further said, “This place is approximately 25 km upstream from Malari village in the tributary of Girthiganga which is further bifurcated in two -- one is Rimkhim and another is Kiogad. Both drained out from Rimkhim Pass and Sankcha Malla (Tibetan borderlands).” He added that in April 2003, 11 jawans had died in a similar snow avalanche incident at the Sumna ITBP camp.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/10-dead-384-rescued-after-avalanche-hits-bro-camps-at-malari-sumna-area-in-ukhand-along-india-china-border/articleshow/82234811.cms||Prashant Jha

Many have even completed their post-graduation from the same college, operating from the premises of the Government Institute of Science. However, these students cannot pursue PhD from NU as it does not have the facility. They need to move outside the state to get a PhD. Teachers at GIFSc said a proposal was moved in the Management Council in last October by member Dinesh Sheram, who pointed out that despite being ranked 150th in the National Institute Ranking Framework (NIRF), the prestigious college lacked the facility of a research centre. GIFSc is the only one of it’s kind institute in entire Vidarbha, and third one in Maharashtra after Mumbai and Aurangabad, offering graduate and postgraduate courses in the highly specialised subject. Acknowledging that forensic graduates lacked the facility to do PhD in NU, vice chancellor Subhash Chaudhari said there was a big flaw which they had removed in the new rules for pursuing doctorate degrees. “Till now, the regular Board of Interdisciplinary Studies wasn’t constituted, and therefore, there was no Board of Studies and Research Recognition Committee (RRC) for forensic science. After we carried out the amendment, the students can now enrol for PhD,” he said. The VC also said NU would take steps to recognize GIFSc as research centre for PhD aspirants from the next academic session. “The demand was very old, since when I was a member of the Academic Council. The new rules for PhD would immensely help students pursue their dreams,” he said. Sheram in his proposal submitted to the Management Council mentioned that about 120 graduates have passed out of GIFSc since 2011, of which 33 have cleared the National Eligibility Test(NET)/State Eligibility Test (SET). “It comes out to 27%, which is one of the best ratios in the entire country. All these bright scholars are disappointed they don’t have the facility to pursue research in their favourite subject. The GIFSc has students from other states as well like Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana among others.” The GIFSc teachers informed that if NU grants recognition as research centre to the college it would be the first one to do so in Maharashtra, and therefore, it should be done on priority. “We offer two diploma courses apart from UG and PG degrees. We impart teaching in seven specialized subjects. We’ve a highly qualified team of one director, one professor, two associate and 17 assistant professors along with 16 non-teaching staff. The graduates passing out from here have immense job opportunities in the Regional Forensic Science Laboratory at Dhantoli and other places,” they said. THE ISSUE * GIFSc set up in 2011 & six batches have passed out * Many students cleared NET/SET * But they can’t pursue PhD in forensics, as NU lacks facility * Demand made to recognize GIFSc as research centre * Mgt Council member Dinesh Sheram first raised demand * VC says NU removed flaws & included subject in new rules * GIFsc would be granted research centre soon||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nu-close-to-granting-phd-research-centre-status-to-govt-institute-of-forensic-science/articleshow/82235959.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

He also announced that a 1,200-bed Covid hospital will be set up at Gandhinagar Helipad Ground to deal with the increasing number of Covid-19 cases. The oxygen plant will produce 280 litres of oxygen every minute. “A special drive has begun where oxygen is being made available to hospitals and patients through PM Cares Fund. Under this scheme, 11 oxygen plants will be set up shortly in Gujarat as well,” Shah said. Endorsing Gujarat’s fight against the pandemic even as the second wave of cases has stretched available resources to the limit, Shah said Gujarat has done a commendable job under CM Vijay Rupani and deputy CM Nitin Patel. Amit Shah also inaugurated medical facilities and equipment worth Rs 10 crore at establishments in the Gandhinagar Lok Sabha constituency. Thanking the Union home minister, CM Vijay Rupani said the facilities will go a long way in combating the spread of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/11-new-oxygen-plants-to-come-up-in-state/articleshow/82236885.cms||---
---||Pune||Delay in settling claims by TPAs adds to woes: Hosps||Pune: Delays in settling health insurance claims by Third Party Administrators (TPAs) are slowing down patient discharges from city hospitals, further compounding the bed shortage issue. The average patient discharge time for hospitals offering cashless hospitalisation to Covid-19 patients has now increased from six hours to nine hours, or even more.Representatives of city hospitals told TOI that the delays in processing patient insurance claims and bills by the TPAs — intermediaries between insurance companies, the insured and hospitals — are causing a bed to be blocked by a recovered patient for several hours. They said if the claims were settled faster, more beds would be available for new Covid admissions. As per the procedure, until these claims are settled, the patient whose bill is being processed cannot be discharged and continues to occupy a bed.Dr Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director of Bharati hospital, told TOI, “The outgoing patients cannot be discharged unless an approval on their bills is recieved from the TPAs. With several discharges slotted during a day, this is holding up many beds. In case billing documents are sent to the TPA concerned after 2pm, then the processing doesn’t happen on the same day. The bed is thus blocked till 11 am-noon the next day, the time by which the entire process is completed.”Dr Oswal said the hospital also cannot charge the patient if the claim settlement takes many hours and patient stays overnight (an additional day) in the hospital.Dr Supriya Deshpande, TPA coordinator, Bharati hospital, said, “If there are queries from the TPA once the bill and summary have been given for approval, that further adds up to an extra four hours in the processing time. There is a delay in eight out of 10 discharges due to claim processing time, which causes delay in providing beds to patients who urgently need them.”Dr Sanjay Patil, Chairman, Hospital Board of India, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Pune, told TOI, “The average time between settling cashless claims and the actual discharge earlier (non-Covid period) took about six hours in case of bigger hospitals. This has now increased to nine hours or more, which means that the actual discharge in some cases may take 20-24 hours. As the number of patients has surged and the TPAs are facing manpower issues, the 30-odd TPAs in Pune should come together and address this issue. They should fast track the process.”Dr Purvez Grant, managing trustee and chief cardiologist of Ruby Hall Clinic, said, “Since the process is now taking eight hours in many cases, it extends a patient’s stay in the hospital by a day, till which time a bed remains blocked. Also, the TPAs come up with various queries, which further delays the process. In addition, the transactions aren’t completely cashless, especially in cases where part of the claim is rejected by the insurance company. This causes patient families to squabble.”Dr Grant said by the time such processes are complete, the incoming patients have to wait in the casualty ward. “We see nearly 30 instances a day where beds are blocked due to health insurance claim clearance delays” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/delay-in-settling-claims-by-tpas-adds-to-woes-hosps/articleshow/82235992.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Kolkata||Hosps’ cashless ‘denial’ puts insurance cos in a fix||Kolkata: Despite an IRDA circular, some hospitals and nursing homes have allegedly found a loophole to deny cashless facility to patients. “Citing non-availability of beds to patients, some nursing homes and hospitals are offering beds later if the family of a patient is ready to pay some advance,” an executive of a TPA said. Insurance companies and third party insurers are not sure whether the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority circular, issued on Thursday, will enforce hospitals to adhere to cashless settlement of Covid claims. The IRDA has asked all insurers that empanelled hospitals have to give cashless insurance to Covid patients. According to the executive, there are 150 network hospitals in the state which are bound to give cashless service to patients having a health insurance. In the circular also, IRDA has mentioned about these empanelled hospitals. “The smaller nursing homes are anyway not part of this cashless universe but during the second wave, the scarcity of beds is so much that a lot of people are going to non-network health facilities as well,” he added. An official of a leading insurer pointed out that absence of a hospital regulator has made the matter worse. “Hospitals are not under IRDA. So at best what insurance companies can do is to put the hospital on the negative list so no insurance claim will be entertained from that hospital. But in the current situations, hospitals are much in demand. So by putting a hospital on a negative list will further reduce the number of beds for patients in the ecosystem. This is a real problem,” the official said. IRDA has written in a circular on Thursday that some hospitals are denying cashless facility to policy-holders for treatment of Covid-19 despite having such arrangement with insurers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hosps-cashless-denial-puts-insurance-cos-in-a-fix/articleshow/82235418.cms||---

He said the state would start the exercise of vaccinating people in the age group of 18 to 44 years from May 1, following the Union government’s approval. Ajit Pawar said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had discussed the details of the vaccine availability and pricing with the CEO of Serum Institute of India (SII), Adar Poonawalla. “We shall ensure that besides the Indian companies, the state receives vaccines from foreign manufacturers with the coordination and support from the Union government,” he said. On if the state would announce free vaccination for the beneficiaries of this age group, the deputy chief minister said the chief minister would be making a formal announcement regarding the new phase of vaccination on May 1. Ajit Pawar said the state might consider free vaccination for those in the economically weaker section of the society. He said the state government might make an appeal to citizens that those who can afford to pay for the vaccine should pay for it and the government would foot the bill of poor people who can’t afford it. On the shortage of vaccines, Ajit Pawar said the state had repeatedly reached out to the Centre on it. He said the Centre had to provide vaccines to all states and so there was bound to be a shortage. The deputy chief minister also said the state government had requested the Centre not to reduce Maharashtra’s allocation of 250 metric tonnes of oxygen from Jamnagar. He said even if there was a demand to start a new Covid centre, it should be done in consultation with the public health department as there would be need of oxygen at those hubs also. Meeting on curbs on Monday Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said the decision on whether to continue with the current restrictions or not would be taken on Monday in Mumbai. He said inputs would be sought from all district guardian ministers before taking any decisions. Ajit Pawar said the number of patients discharged was higher than the positive cases in the last one week in Pune district. But he said a large number of patients from outside Pune were being admitted to the city’s hospitals, putting pressure on them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-to-float-global-tender-for-vaccines-remdesivir-dy-cm/articleshow/82236004.cms||---

The accused allegedly killed his son over a property dispute. The accused has been identified as Vilas Bhande. As per the complaint registered by Vilas’s wife Jayshri, her husband killed son Ganesh Vilas Bhande, a farmer and police patil of the village, with an axe. She stated in her complaint that her husband had left their house 25 years ago and had only returned last year after the Covid-related lockdown was announced. Since there was no information about Vilas, her son Ganesh had got their ancestral land transferred in his name. Last year, when he returned home, Vilas was informed that the property was transferred to his son’s name, following which ,he again left the house saying he was going to Pune. After stringent restrictions were announced amid the current situtation, Vilas returned two weeks ago. On Thursday, Vilas demanded money from his wife to buy a tobacco sachet. However, she told her husband to take it from her son and left to work in the farm. Before leaving for the farm, she had an argument with Vilas as he wanted the land back in his name. When she returned home at 5 pm, she found that the door of their house was closed. Her nephew informed her that Vilas was telling everyonein the village that he hacked his son to death. When Jayshri went inside the house, she found Ganesh lying dead in a pool of blood.

Forest department officers suspect the baby elephant, aged nearly eight to ten months, and its mother were attacked by tigers in the deep forests of Edamalakkudy, around 4.5km from Edalipparakkudy. Munnar range officer Hareendra Kumar said tribespeople informed him that they heard tiger growls and trumpeting of the elephant on April 18. The next day, the forest officers who reached the spot, saw the mother elephant and the baby elephant standing by the side of a stream. A day after, they found the mother elephant lying dead near to the stream and the baby elephant standing near to it. "Forest officers and veterinary officers reached the spot on April 20 and the mother elephant was buried after a postmortem was conducted on it. The baby elephant was taken in a truck to the forest camp at Devikulam, about 31km away. "The veterinary doctors found six deep wounds on the body of the baby elephant. It was difficult to make the baby elephant move away from its mother’s body," said an officer. "The doctors said a pair of sub-adult tigers must have attacked the elephant herd. The loud sound of the elephant must have scared away the young tigers. The mother elephant apparently died after suffering a fall," he said. "The baby elephant’s health condition is improving. We will hand it over to an elephant care centre at Kotoor or Konni," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/baby-elephant-rescued-from-munnar-forest/articleshow/82235424.cms||Sandeep Thomas

My Home Jewel, which emerged as a Covid-19 cluster after it reported 112 cases, became the first gated community in the city to vaccinate its residents in a two-day drive held on April 22-23. According to the My Home Jewel Owners Welfare Association, a total of 400 residents were vaccinated during the drive held at their club house with the support of urban primary health centre, Hafeezpet. “Majority of those vaccinated were senior citizens and those above 45 years of age. In addition to this, we are also helping residents provide free paramedics and ambulance service, supply medicines, food and groceries to Covid-19 affected families. We have tied up with nearby hospitals to attend to the patients on priority. We are also procuring couple of oxygen concentrators to help the residents in need,” said Nanda Kishore, general secretary of My Home Jewel Apartment Owners Welfare Association, Madinaguda. Many more gated communities, especially in the IT corridor of the city, are now following suit. Resident welfare associations have reached out to the health wing of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), nearby hospitals and urban primary healthcare centers to organise similar vaccination camps for their residents. “We have given a representation to the GHMC and nearby private hospitals seeking a vaccination camp within our community. We have about 2,000 flats with population of about 7,000 residents. It’s time the government opens up vaccination drives in gated communities and housing societies for better coverage,” said Kalyan Reddy, general secretary of My Home Vihanga RWA.

---||Kochi||Kerala: Elephant herds frequenting Munnar||IDUKKI: Elephant herds have been frequenting the hill stations of Munnar and Mattuppetty for the past few days apparently due to decline in tourist arrivals following the Covid-19 second wave. Prasad Ambattu, a local journalist and a photographer in Munnar, said that due to the decline in tourist arrivals, elephant herds, including calves, have been spotted along the Periyavara-Mattuppetty route. Lack of human presence and vehicles provides a free movement to them. Padayappa, a popular wild elephant in Munnar, had raided a fruit shop in Munnar town last Wednesday. It was the third such incident reported in the last three months. In February, Padayappa had a raided fruit shop owned by a man named Palraj and ate nearly 180kg worth of fruits. Munnar range officer Hareendra Kumar said that the forest department always provide compensation to affected merchants. “Wild elephants are regular visitors in Munnar and it is a forest land and we can’t remove them from there. When we get a complaint about a wild elephant attack, we immediately take steps to provide compensation to the affected,” said Kumar. Elephant expert P S Essa said that less human presence was the main reason for wild elephants freely roaming in Munnar. “During the last year’s lockdown period, we had seen wild elephants freely roaming around Munnar, including towns. After lockdown restrictions were lifted and life became normal, elephants went back to forests,” said Essa. “Chances are high for more animals to venture out in the streets in the coming days, if lockdown kind of situation comes into place in Munnar,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/elephant-herds-frequenting-munnar/articleshow/82235434.cms||Sandeep Thomas

Vyom Solanki, who works as a security guard at a residential society, said, “I went to the Amul store to look for masks but didn’t find them. I use a cotton mask which works fine for me, but with the rise in cases all around, I feel a disposable mask would be better.

---||Chandigarh||Kunwar included actor Akshay Kumar in the case due to his fantasies, says HC||CHANDIGARH: Indicting former Punjab Police IGP Kunwar Pratap Singh for “absurdity” in conducting the probe in Kotkapura firing related to the sacrilege case, the Punjab and Haryana high court has held that he had involved film actor Akshay Kumar only because of his fantasies. “Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh has gone to the height of his fantasy when he has brought in film actor Akshay Kumar into the picture as part of a conspiracy because he had produced a film called, ‘Singh is Bling’ and had tried to exhibit the same in the state of Punjab,” observed the HC. In his detailed judgment, Justice Rajbir Sehrawat observed that Kunwar tried to involve actor Akshay Kumar by invoking the timing of the release of ‘Singh is Bling’ and by alleging that Sukhbir Singh Badal met Baba Ram Rahim along with Akshay Kumar. “All these aspects are totally irrelevant and reflect upon the absurdity of the investigation claimed to have been conducted by him,” observed the judge. The HC was of the view that the former cop had failed to collect any material to reasonably connect that incident in any manner to the allegations of conspiracy proposed in this case. The high court also observed that even an old incident of 2012 (in which Dera Sacha Sauda chief was booked for allegedly dressing as one of the Gurus but was later pardoned by Akal Takht) regarding which the FIR also stood cancelled several years back, was sought to be invoked by Kunwar Vijay Pratap to allege a conspiracy by the political functionary of the opposite party namely, Sukhbir Singh Badal. “Even on this count, he could not collect any material because the Granthi, whom Kunwar Vijay Pratap claimed to have examined, has stated that the said pardon was rightly granted, although it should not have been granted in a hurried manner. “This court fails to understand as to how and why a purely religious issue, which was dealt with by the top religious leaders of Sikhs, has been brought into the picture by him,” HC said. Unsubstantiated and awkward claim In the 89-page judgment, the HC observed that Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh also made a totally unsubstantiated and awkward claim in his written statement that his functioning has been appreciated by two judges of this court on the administrative side. “There is nothing on record as to who were the judges who appreciated the functioning of Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh and what was the administrative purpose, for which the said judges contacted him on administrative side,” according to the HC order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/kunwar-included-actor-akshay-kumar-in-the-case-due-to-his-fantasies-says-hc/articleshow/82236005.cms||Ajay Sura
---||India||Covid-safety measures not up to the mark in Bengal: EC||NEW DELHI: Noting that the enforcement of Disaster Management Act to ensure a Covid-safe poll campaign in West Bengal had been less than adequate, the Election Commission on Saturday directed the state disaster management authority (SDMA) headed by the chief secretary, to step up its assigned statutory duty to enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour. The instructions were given at a meeting chaired by chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra here to discuss strict implementation of EC’s guidelines for a Covid-safe campaign. Participating in the online review meeting were election commissioner Rajiv Kumar and senior officers of West Bengal including the chief secretary, secretary (disaster management), health secretary, DGP, Kolkata police commissioner, state chief electoral officers and state police nodal officer cum ADG (law and order). An EC release said the district machinery, which is tasked with election-related work, is responsible for enforcement of laws including the DM Act. The commission directed that the SDMA and its functionaries must implement and monitor the implementation of Covid norms during the campaign and take appropriate action in case of any violation. The chief secretary apprised EC that West Bengal government was in receipt of ECI directions on enforcement of Covid-19 norms during electioneering. He assured that the entire machinery had been directed to take more stringent and prompt steps for sensitisation and enforcement of extant instructions under the Act. The commission appreciated the state machinery for the flawless arrangements in polling booths for Covid-appropriate behaviour and safe disposal of bio medical waste. It was informed that as per the directions given by the commission, preventive Covid gear including 2.4 crore face masks, 17 lakh face shields, 5.5 lakh hand sanitiser bottles of different capacities, 1.31 lakh PPE gear; and 10 crore hand-gloves had been procured by the poll authorities in West Bengal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-safety-measures-not-up-to-the-mark-in-bengal-ec/articleshow/82237634.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Rooms away from homes for Covid patients’ care, with amenities galore||PUNE: Multiple agencies have come up in the city offering asymptomatic Covid-19 patients a room with amenities, including air-conditioning, TV, WiFi and meals, at rates that the proprietors claim are less than hospital packages. The facilities, however, do not include nursing and medical services. Rakhi Srivastava of one such facility Propel Stay said, “We used to provide hotel rooms and service apartments for corporate clients. But since Covid started, we have started renting out the rooms for the asymptomatic Covid-19 patients. This is done on a no-profit-no-loss basis.” She said, “The daily charge for single occupancy is Rs1,800 and the rate goes up to Rs3,500 for double occupancy costs about Rs3,500. We provide three meals, coffee, tea, lemon juice and turmeric milk, apart from amenities such as AC and WiFi. We have seen many individuals, as well as families, moving in since the start of the pandemic, recovering here and then returning to their houses.” A customer care employee of Fab Hotels said some of its facilities have been converted into accommodation for Covid-19 patients. “We have properties in Talegaon, Pimpri Chinchwad and Hadapsar. The property in Hadapsar is now completely booked. The daily charge for a room in Talegaon is about Rs2,000. The rate in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation limits is around Rs3,000. We have a doctor on call for emergency and the hotel staffers help the patients with medicines. However, no one is allowed to enter these rooms for at least seven days,” he said. An IT professional, who had moved into one such facility after testing Covid positive, said, “Many of my acquaintances who tested positive and stayed in home quarantine ended up infecting others in the family. I wanted to keep my wife, daughter and elderly mother safe at home and chose to stay in the hotel services. I stayed in the facility for 14 days and the experience was satisfying.” Several home-made tiffin services have also come up across the city for individuals or families testing positive for the contagion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rooms-away-from-homes-for-covid-patients-care-with-amenities-galore/articleshow/82236010.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Chennai||A fight between creative rights and legal protocols||Chennai: The ongoing war of words between director Shankar and producer V Ravichandran over the remake rights of Tamil film ‘Anniyan’ raises yet again the issue of how unprepared tinsel town is when it comes to written agreements, legal documents and other intellectual property matters involved in the making of a movie.The original Vikram-starrer ‘Anniyan’ released in 2005. At present, the parties involved are bickering over an issue which may finally go to court, where they would be asked to produce an agreement showing which one of them has the rights to the script and its impending adaptation, and how the profit-sharing ratio should be arrived at. Since the writer of the film, Sujatha (alias Rangarajan) died in 2008, his family members may be able to throw some light, provided they are willing to participate in the ongoing tussle. Till then the industry stands divided over the issue.Director Shankar, who has worked for multi-crore films and introduced advanced technology in his work, is not new to controversies. A non-bailable warrant was issued to him in the ‘Enthiran’ plagiarism case. Locking horns with him is ace producer Ravichandran, who has promoted many aspiring directors. An industry expert, on condition of anonymity, says both are fighting over something that was not discussed at the start of the project. "Old school producers and directors venture into a project without an agreement and later end up washing their dirty linen in public. First, bring in clauses such as right to refusal, profit-sharing if a movie is remade in other languages in future. The baffling part is this movie was dubbed in Hindi when it had released. People are asking why it is being remade when the subject is well known."Senior advocate N L Rajah says given the complex nature of the copyright law, these issues are bound to happen. It is better parties resolve them through institutionalised bodies that pass resolutions, without souring relationships. Arbitration can be one way. "With the current restriction due to the pandemic, it is better they do not knock at the court’s door because it may take years to arrive at a conclusion. All creative people for the good of the industry must bring in a structure to avoid these unwanted ambiguities and disputes."Producer and Blue Ocean Film and Television Academy dean G Dhananjayan says having proper documents is essential. "When I produce a movie, I make sure all the papers are in place. I procure the copyrights if I am to remake a movie to avoid any grey area. Young directors do their homework and come prepared when it comes to profit-sharing and remaking rights."Now that the ‘Anniyan’ tussle has reached the South Indian Film Chamber of Commerce, the office bearers should take a neutral stand and settle the issue before it reaches court, says producer Srinivasan Shivpprasadh, nephew of veteran actor and doyen of Tamil stage R S Manohar. He recollects how in the past there were people who had cleverly bought the negative rights of films from producers. "Director K Balaji knew the tricks of the trade and bought the negative rights for the Malayalam movie ‘Irumbazhikal’ to use the train sequence from our production house. There there are others like writer-director-actor Visu whose screenplay ‘Kudumbam Oru Kadambam’ was remade by Cochin Haneefa in 1985 as ‘Oru Sandesam Koodi’. Visu came to know of it only in 2005 and was shocked. He said he had signed all the papers given to him since he was a novice. So the industry has a mix of people who are clever and cunning."Dhananjayan says fighting a war without required documents is fruitless. Citing directors such as Jeethu Joseph and Pushkar-Gayathri as examples, he says people need to be categorical about their wants and rights and emotions should be kept at bay.Madras high court advocate V Lakshminarayanan says the film industry has always been like this. "They do not have a proper registry. A script is sent to a producer or the concerned person through post, which they show as proof. A centralised registry is needed. Years ago, I had filed a suit on behalf of a writer when a director had lifted a story of his and made it into a movie without seeking permission."Even maestro Ilaiyaraaja got stuck in the ever-lasting grey area when he demanded royalties from S P Balasubrahmanyam for performing his compositions during the late singer’s world tour a few years ago. Legal luminaries say the Indian copyright law is a sticky subject. You can find everything you want to find in it, with almost every stakeholder finding clauses and rules that justify their motives. In most cases, such claims lead to a torrent of confusion and litigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/a-fight-between-creative-rights-and-legal-protocols/articleshow/82232315.cms||---

After consulting her mother, the girl lodged a complaint with the Wakad police station on Friday. The police registered a case of stalking and invoked provisions of the Information Technology Act as well as Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. The police suspect that the man, who has uploaded the defamatory and objectionable photographs and text on the girl’s profile page, may be her acquaintance. It is suspected that the man follows her on the digital platform. According to the police, the man also sent objectionable and derogatory text messages to the girl in the last few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-uploads-defamatory-posts-online/articleshow/82236011.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Covid rules may bring down flyer count in West Bengal||KOLKATA: Airlines, travel agents and airport operators expect the passenger count to nosedive from Monday as the state tightens rules on incoming passengers, barring anyone who does not have a negative report of an RT-PCR test from over a dozen cities. On Friday, the state government had announced that those taking flights to Kolkata, Bagdogra or Andal from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh from Monday would have to furnish an RT-PCR Covid negative test report prior to boarding. Such reports are already required for passengers boarding from Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Kochi. There is an existing ban on flights from five cities of Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Ahmedabad and Chennai on four days of the week, barring Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. “Owing to the surge in Covid infection across India, passenger count at the airport has almost halved in a month. The new notification is going to hurt the aviation industry further. Our call centres are flooded with queries from customers saying they are finding it difficult to get themselves tested,” said an airline official. That the test has to be carried out within 72 hours prior to departure seems to be a tall order for passengers in the current situation, where even genuine patients are finding it difficult to get them tested on time and get their reports within 48 hours. “My friend was scheduled to fly down from Varanasi next Tuesday. But I guess he will have to book a car. He tried to get a test done today but failed,” said Ankit Sharma, a resident of New Town. The Covid test centre recently opened at the Kolkata Airport, is also getting flooded with passengers getting themselves tested before flying.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-rules-may-bring-down-flyer-count/articleshow/82235436.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

While large companies already have agreements linked with hospitals and other healthcare providers to administer shots either on-site or at hospitals and other designated sites, smaller companies, whose employees form upto 90% of local industrial workforce, have teamed up with other companies to make collective arrangements. While there is little by way of paucity of funds or required infrastructure, recent reports of vaccine shortages have thrown a spanner in their works, as industries were betting on a quick and wide rollout. “We have made all arrangements to vaccinate our workforce at our premises. We are ready to cover vaccine costs for our employees, and an agreement is already in place with a hospital for assistance in the process. However, we are worried about the supply of the vaccines being slow. Since most of our workforce is below the age of 40, we would like to vaccinate as many people as possible in order to make the resumption of full operations easier,” said a spokesperson of a major engineering firm in the city. Even for organisations that may have trouble covering vaccination costs for their employees, industry representatives say that they are ready to replicate an already existing model for vaccinations that are free at the point of delivery. “Most companies are more than willing to cover vaccination costs for their employees. For those who may not be able to, there is also the model of the vaccination centre at Bhosari that can be replicated,” said Prashant Girbane, director general of MCCIA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/industries-ready-for-may-1-shot-rollout-but-concerned-about-irregular-supply/articleshow/82236012.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||HC order exposes Congress-AAP nexus to defame us: Akalis||CHANDIGARH: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) said on Saturday the “politically motivated, malicious and vendetta-driven” inquiry launched by Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, in league with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), in sacrilege and associated police firing cases of 2015 had proved that the Congress government and its collaborators were not interested in nailing the real culprits behind these heinous acts. The SAD leaders also said that the chief minister was only playing politics on the issue. SAD’s Maheshinder Singh Grewal and Daljit Singh Cheema claimed the Punjab and Haryana high court judgment released on Friday in the Kotkapura police firing case had exposed the unholy nexus between the Congress and AAP to defame the SAD as well as Sikh institutions. “Since the chief minister led the exercise by holding meetings to execute the Congress and AAP’s political agenda, along with leaders like PPCC president Sunil Jakhar, Navjot Sidhu and Sukhjinder Randhawa, he does not have any moral right to continue in office and should resign,” they said. AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal was also hand in glove with the Congress in promoting and defending former tainted police officer Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh who was charged with executing the conspiracy, claimed the Akali duo. They added since a direct criminal conspiracy had been proved following the high court verdict, Kunwar should be charge-sheeted and a criminal case should be registered against him after which “he should be arrested and punished for his misdeeds”. The party also demanded a speedy probe into the three incidents of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib of 2015 by filing of challans in the cases. It said that four years had been wasted with the Congress government content in emotionally exploiting the incidents rather than nailing the culprits. “The SAD stand remains the same. Let nothing remain of those who indulged in the heinous crimes or those who supported them and even those who are playing politics on the issue of sacrilege,” said the Akali functionaries. Though the Congress and AAP conspiracy against the Akali Dal had succeeded in the short run with the party losing the 2017 assembly elections, the high court verdict had exposed the rival intentions to implicate the SAD in the case, they claimed. Cheema claimed the HC had made it clear that Kunwar had conducted an investigation which smacked of malice, irrationality and absurdity, and that the former officer had invoked a mixture of religion, politics and police administration. The court made it clear that the former IG had a tendency to misuse his official position and overawe the judicial process as he did by writing a letter to the session’s court on the administrative side to accuse the CJM of having close proximity with the former CM Parkash Singh Badal without any proof, he added. The HC noted that Kunwar indulged in political theatrics to fulfil his own political purpose of creating post-retirement greener pastures for himself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-order-exposes-cong-aap-nexus-to-defame-us-akalis/articleshow/82236014.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Club together similar govt depts: ARC||Thiruvananthapuram: The administrative reforms commission under former chief minister V S Achuthanandan has recommended regrouping the functionally similar government departments for effective and optimal performance, which at present are staggered under various secretaries. As many as 49 secretariat departments existing currently have been regrouped into 17 core sectors with each of them to be headed by an additional chief secretary or a principal secretary. The 49 departments can separately be handled by a secretary or a special secretary. For example, according to the ARC, industries, Norka, labour and skills, power and electronics and information technology should be brought under the core sector namely industries and labour. Similarly, social justice, SC/ST development, food and civil supplies and backward classes development should be brought under the core function of social justice. At present, most of these departments come under additional chief secretaries and principal secretaries who report to different ministers. This results in conflicting policies due to a lack of coordination. Making things worse, the government had recently even begun appointing multiple secretaries in a single department, thereby opening the possibility of one secretary being bypassed in case he or she has a difference of opinion with seniors. “It is normal to give multiple charges to one officer to address the shortage of officers. But it would be more effective if the multiple charges given to a single officer are those with similar core functions, and preferably under the same minister,” a senior IAS officer said on conditions of anonymity. The ARC also found that the secretariat has been transformed into an extension of line department for carrying out a part of governance which is strictly in the domain of line departments. It observed that the present-day secretariat functioning usurps line functions of field departments and thereby cause ineffectiveness and unprofessionalism in Secretariat functions and create barriers in the effective functioning of line departments. It further said that the present style of functioning adversely affects the originally envisaged functions of the secretariat. As a remedy, the ARC recommended that a complete restructuring based on clear division of staff and line functions and reorganisation of secretariat departments on ‘functional’ basis, instead of on work distribution, would produce better results. The ARC also recommended that all cabinet proceedings be converted to e-format. Though the e-file system has been adopted by the secretariat, the cabinet files are still physical files. Further, it said that the rules of business, which is the magna carta of secretariat functions, should not be maintained as a secret document anymore. “In the present-day scenario, the approach of governance has changed from that of secrecy to transparency. Hence it is a paradox to keep Rules of Business as a secret document. The Rules of Business therefore may be made a public document,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/club-together-similar-govt-depts-arc/articleshow/82235466.cms||KP Saikiran

Delhi Jal Board (DJB) issued an advisory for city residents on Saturday to store and use water judiciously. It said that water levels in Wazirabad pond — which is fed by river Yamuna — had reached 668 feet against the standard levels of 674.5 feet. “Due to depletion of levels at Wazirabad Pond and reduction in the release of raw water by Haryana into Yamuna, water production has been curtailed from the water treatment plants at Wazirabad and Chandrawal. The water supply shall be affected on Sunday evening and so on, till the pond level improves to normal,” DJB said. “The areas likely to be affected are Civil Lines, Hindu Rao Hospital and adjoining areas, Kamla Nagar, Shakti Nagar and adjoining areas, Karol Bagh, Paharganj and NDMC areas, Old and New Rajinder Nagar , East Patel Nagar and West Patel Nagar, Baljeet Nagar, Prem Nagar, Inderpuri, among others,” said the advisory. South Delhi areas likely to be impacted include Greater Kailash, South Extension, Kalkaji, Govindpuri, Amar Colony, Tughlaqabad, Sangam Vihar, Ambedkar Nagar, Prahladpur and adjoining areas. In other parts of Delhi, the areas likely to be impacted include Ramleela Ground, Delhi Gate, Subhash Park, Model Town, Gulabi Bagh, Punjabi Bagh, Jahangirpuri, Moolchand, Burari and adjoining areas, and parts of Cantonment areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/djb-dip-in-yamuna-levels-to-hit-supply/articleshow/82236023.cms||---

Bidkar said that it was necessary to boost vaccination in view of rising Covid-19 cases in the city. Mayor Muralidhar Mohol said more vaccination centres have already been set up in the current phase. A separate plan will be chalked out for the third phase to be implemented from May 1. The civic administration on Saturday received nine more ambulances for Covid-19 mitigation. Of these, two ambulances will be for patients, while another two will be cardiac ambulances. Remaining five will be used as hearses.

Activists have drafted a letter to the chief minister and health minister, raising their demands. Ravindra Sinha, an activist, said that while the state is opening up vaccination for a younger age group, they should focus on areas where cases are high, people with comorbidities and organise vaccination programmes at large societies. Politicians too are demanding that vaccination should be carried out at housing societies. “The vaccination can be carried out on the lines of polling booths. Many big housing societies had set up polling stations. A similar process can be followed for vaccination,” said Medha Kulkarni, former MLA of Kothrud.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/citizens-seek-jab-at-home-arrangement/articleshow/82236018.cms||---

It has also attacked the government for lack of management during the recent Covid wave. Between April 11 and 14, central government officials mapping oxygen requirement sought a reply from Delhi government, which had appointed a nodal officer only on April 9, said Delhi Congress vice-president Abhishek Dutt. “This was a major reason for Delhi placing less demand for predicting the future requirement during oxygen mapping.” The government got the right information only after April 16, he alleged. “This is a criminal negligence on part of the government. This should be investigated under the supervision of a senior judge of the Supreme Court and Delhi High Court,” demanded Dutt. He alleged that even test results were delayed to slow down hospital admission. “There seems to be a well-planned conspiracy to hide the government’s gross negligence… the information on actual deaths” will be revealed only after the investigation, Dutt said. The government hasn’t even properly used the funds received from the Centre to set up eight PSA oxygen plants, he claimed.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: CBI books Anil Deshmukh for extortion & in Sachin Waze case||NEW DELHI/NAGPUR: The CBI has filed an FIR against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh in the corruption and extortion-related allegations levelled against him by former Mumbai top cop Param Bir Singh. Significantly, the FIR focuses on the controversial reinstatement of API Sachin Waze, now held in the explosives case, saying the twin decisions to rehabilitate the “encounter” specialist and to task him with important cases were “in the knowledge” of Deshmukh, something which immediately sparked speculation that those directly involved in making the calls could also be in the agency’s crosshairs. The FIR was filed on Wednesday under Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act and section 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC and names Deshmukh as an accused. He is likely to be extensively grilled in the coming days, a source said. On Saturday, CBI teams conducted massive searches across 4 locations in Maharashtra, including a 14-hour search of his Nagpur home-cum-office. ‘Offered full cooperation’ to CBI team, says DeshmukhThe CBI searched three of former home minister Anil Deshmukh’s premises, including his office, on Saturday, a source said. The searches were conducted simultaneously at four locations from 7.30am. The agency is learnt to have seized electronic gadgets and some documents. The CBI said all officers who were part of the searches wore PPE kits while following all Covid protocols. Sources say the CBI collected some prima facie technical evidence on the basis of which the allegations reportedly seem to be prima facie corroborating. “The facts which emerged during the PE (preliminary enquiry) need a thorough probe for which an FIR is required,” said an official. The CBI’s FIR comes after the agency conducted an exhaustive preliminary enquiry for two weeks on the orders of the Bombay high court. On April 14, the CBI had grilled Deshmukh for eight hours after quizzing multiple people. The FIR, a copy of which is with TOI, states the PE had prima facie revealed that a cognizable offence was made out in the matter, wherein Deshmukh and others have attempted to obtain undue advantage for improper and dishonest performance of public duty. It says the PE has revealed API Sachin Waze was reinstated in service after 15 years and entrusted with most sensational and important cases of Mumbai police with Deshmukh being in knowledge of this fact. The FIR mentions a part of Param Bir Singh’s 104-pagelong complaint alleging Deshmukh and others exercised undue influence over transfer postings of police personnel “thereby exercising undue influence over their performance”. Meanwhile, in Nagpur, the CBI team entered Deshmukh’s residence around 8am and left at 6.30pm, following which even he departed for his constituency, Katol, to visit a newly opened Covid care centre. However, all of a sudden, the CBI team returned around 7pm. Deshmukh too was then called back and he arrived after 30 minutes. Finally, Deshmukh left for Katol after the CBI team departed at 10pm. “The CBI conducted a search at my place. I offered full cooperation to them,” he said before leaving for Katol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-offered-full-cooperation-to-cbi-team-says-deshmukh/articleshow/82236992.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: NCP condemns Deshmukh raids; ‘abuse of power’, says minister||Mumbai: NCP on Saturday condemned the CBI’s searches of the residences of former home minister Anil Deshmukh while chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had a marathon meeting with senior cabinet members Dilip Walse Patil and Nawab Malik, chief secretary Sitaram Kunte and DGP Sanjay Pandey to take stock of the situation after the agency registered a case.  State NCP president and water resources minister Jayant Patil alleged CBI was misusing the permission granted by the high court to settle political scores. “We are condemning the raids. The CBI was granted permission for conducting a preliminary probe, but the agency utilised the permission to achieve political goals,” Patil said. Patil said so far there is no information if the CBI has submitted the preliminary report to the Bombay high court, but it appears that the agency has taken action on the basis of statements made by some of the accused in the case of explosives found in an SUV near the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani. Patil said after the high court granted permission to CBI to conduct a preliminary probe against Deshmukh, he resigned on his own and cooperated with the investigating agency and has given a satisfactory response to the CBI. NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik called it an abuse of power. “The CBI’s action amounts to defaming the MVA government, Anil Deshmukh and an attempt to destabilise the state government,” Malik said. “We have full faith in the judiciary, no one is above law. Anil Deshmukh cooperated with the CBI. I have a question to ask. Did the high court ask the CBI to register a criminal case? It asked it to conduct a preliminary probe. Under such circumstances, it was expected that the CBI will wait for the directions of the high court,’’ Malik said. Shiv Sena MP and spokesperson Sanjay Raut declined to comment, saying, “The high court directed CBI to conduct a preliminary report. It has done its job, MVA government is doing its job,” Raut said. State Congress president Nana Patole said CBI’s action was for diverting attention from core issues. “When hundreds of Covid-19 patients are dying due to shortage of oxygen, NDA government is asking CBI to conduct raids,” Patole said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-ncp-condemns-deshmukh-raids-abuse-of-power-says-minister/articleshow/82235473.cms||---
---||Pune||Questions crop up about assessment of Std X pupils||Pune: Questions are being raised about the status of private candidates, who fill up form number 17 and appear for the Secondary School Certificate (SSC, Std X) exam externally after the state board cancelled the board exams. It would be hard to give the candidates internal marks because they do not attend classes at regular schools. The same is the case with students, who appear for exams for performance improvement. Another major question is if all students, who filled up the examination form, be promoted. Experts are also worried about how the education department can ensure that there will be no favouritism or bias in internal marking and if a grievance redressal mechanism is possible in this scenario. Transparency in internal marking is very important as this will be considered for merit lists for admissions to FYJC, Polytechnic, ITI and other courses. Educationist Vasant Kalpande, who is a member of the task force made by the state government for conducting the board exams, said, “The board is still discussing and will come up with an answer to all questions. However, personally, I think we may be able to allow the students to take provisional admission in FYJC along with repeat students and ask them to appear for the exams whenever the board conducts them next. Only passing this exam will confirm their admission ,” said Kalpande. Another senior member of the taskforce said that internal marking would be equally problematic across the board. “Internal marks in other boards are also given for projects, assignments, group activities, practicals, etc. Due to the pandemic, none of these activities were actually conducted. Even prior to the pandemic, there was always an element of unfairness because parents help out children and, in some cases, projects are even bought. Hence, internal marks are not foolproof. Even during the assessment of answer sheets, I may give full marks to an essay that others may not like. So, it is an accepted fact that assessment is the privilege of teachers ,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/questions-crop-up-about-assessment-of-std-x-pupils/articleshow/82236028.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Pune||With open sales, country risks inequity: Experts||Pune: The Centre's recent order to states, to procure their own vaccine supply from manufacturers, could give rise to inequitable distribution, public health experts have warned. The warning comes amid calls for a one-nation-one-price policy for vaccines that could help states without giant budgets purchase enough shots when drives start for everyone above 18 from May 1. Experts said vaccine inequity is likely to become a serious problem as half of the supply would be in the open market when coverage starts for all adults. Private players with deep pockets could buy up huge shares. Dr Gagandeep Kang, professor of Microbiology at Christian Medical College and a vaccination expert, said, “One of the fundamental principles when deciding on vaccines is equity; to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to be protected. With short supply, differential responsibility across Centre and state and differential pricing, I hope that vaccination strategies do not create a situation of unequal access for the most vulnerable sections of society.” She added that with vaccines in short supply, the country will be faced with tough questions. “How do we decide what is most important? Preventing severe disease, hospitalizations and deaths or preventing transmission and protection of people who contribute to keeping society functioning?" State health minister Rajesh Tope had said Maharashtra has sought a single nationwide price for vaccines. The demand has been echoed by many states.  Health expert Dr Giridhara Babu said for vaccine equity, states will have to protect the interests of the most vulnerable. For this, he said governments should immediately identify those who won't be able to afford the shots. “States will have to secure doses for the economically weaker sections. And this should be spelt out by the Centre,” Dr Babu said. Member of the Pune Platform for Covid Response, Pradeep Bhargava, said sequential vaccination in the 18-44 group, instead of throwing drives open, will also prevent crowding at vaccination sites. “We risk high transmission and a law and order situation. The IT systems could also crash under the registration load,” Bhargava said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/with-open-sales-country-risks-inequity-experts/articleshow/82236026.cms||Nisha Nambiar

With technology making work easier and faster, the familiar tools that made each region unique are gradually losing their utlity. To hold on to that memory of how life was before the machines, the Madurai Kamaraj University will be setting up the Tamil Culture and Heritage Centre.The brain behind the centre, with a collection of more than 200 items of daily use that are now considered artefacts, B Sathiyamoorthi, head of the department of Tamilology, School of Tamil Studies, says, "The aim of the centre is to create awareness about things that were used by the Tamil community, life and occupation."As agriculture was the main occupation in the state, Sathiyamoorthi first got his hands on wooden ploughs, known as ‘kalapai’, followed by a couple of ‘salpanais’ huge vessels with a capacity to store more than 50 litres. "These vessels, made of iron sheets moulded to form a vessel with its bottom fitted with leather that stretched when water was filled in it, were used to draw water from wells for irrigation. They were fitted to pulleys, which in turn were operated by bullocks," says Sathiyamoorthy who identified these tools with the help of his father Ramasamy Bose, a farmer. The granaries of yore used mud vessels, known as ‘kulumais’ and were of different shapes and sizes depending on the type of paddy stored.While some of these items like bullock carts and wooden ploughs are still used by small farmers in remote villages, finding items like leather blowers or ‘tholthurukki’ used by iron smithies was a challenge. "I made 250 trips to different villages till I found a pair in a village near Senthurai in Dindigul district, but the ironsmiths were not willing to part with the blowers which had been in their family for seven generations,’’ said Sathiyamoorthy. Since fishing was another occupation or hobby, some of the less-used tools like bamboo basket ‘ootha’ to catch fish in summer from shallow waters or the ‘pathakattai’, a wooden plank with small holes installed in a flowing river to catch small fish like the ‘ayirai’ was collected to be displayed at the centre.Tools like the potters’ wheel which have undergone many changes over time from the wooden wheel to stone, cement wheel and now power-operated wheel have also been collected to show their evolution over time. "It is important for the future generation to know how we were an environment-friendly community,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/building-a-museum-of-everyday-objects/articleshow/82232333.cms||---

Presiding over a high-level meeting, Nitish said the doctors and paramedical staff can be appointed temporarily by conducting walk-in interviews to fill up the vacancies in the health facilities in districts. Principal secretary to CM Deepak Kumar, principal secretary of health department Pratyaya Amrit, chairman of State Technical Service Commission Ajay Kumar Choudhary and executive director of State Health Society Manoj Kumar were present at the meeting. Earlier, speaking on the occasion of the National Panchayati Raj Diwas, the CM exuded confidence that the people would overcome Covid-19 crisis. Describing the pandemic as the biggest crisis the humanity has faced, Nitish said the government was committed to tiding over the crisis. “We are leaving no stone unturned to provide help to the affected people,” he said. The CM, however, sought people’s cooperation to cope with the situation. He appealed to the people to follow the doctors’ suggestions and guidelines issued by the government to check the spread of the deadly virus. Nitish appealed to people to give honour and respect to the health workers for their sacrifices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-orders-early-recruitment-of-doctors-health-staff-in-govt-hospitals/articleshow/82234880.cms||Ramashankar
---||Pune||Vax shortage slashes daily coverage to 15-day low||Pune: The district on Saturday recorded its lowest daily vaccination coverage in a fortnight because of widespread shortage of doses. The daily number of beneficiaries was just over 24,000. As many as 217 vaccination sites were unable to hold sessions, officials said. Saturday's district total of 24,157 was the lowest since April 9, when 23,776 people got their shots. By the end of the day, the Pune rural administration was left with just 3,520 doses of Covishield. The PMC had only 866 of the shots in its reserves and the PCMC had 1,058. Also, Saturday’s coverage was not even half of the numbers vaccinated on Friday — over 56,800. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “We will be receiving more doses on Sunday: 1.1 lakh doses of Covishield and 8,100 doses of Covaxin. From the Covishield lot, Pune Rural will receive 55,000 doses. The PMC will be given 35,000 the PCMC will receive 20,000. As for Covaxin, Pune rural will get 4,000 doses, the PMC will get 3,000 and the PCMC will be allotted 1,100." Dr Deshmukh said many centres did not hold drives on Saturday because of shortages. About targets for next week, he said, "Our plans depend on availability of doses over the next few days. We have a capacity of 600 centres delivering a minimum of 200 doses each per day. But we need more doses to run at this capacity. This is the reason why vaccination numbers have not been up to the mark in some days of April.” The number of live vaccination centres fell to 383 in the district on Saturday (compared to Friday's 512). Zilla parishad CEO, Ayush Prasad, said, "Some centres in Pune rural could not hold drives on Saturday. But sites that had doses reported 100% coverage. Things should get better from Monday as we are getting more stock."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vax-shortage-slashes-daily-coverage-to-15-day-low/articleshow/82236021.cms||Neha Madaan

Raihanath, who spoke to Kappan over phone on Saturday, told TOI said that the health condition of her husband was very bad. “He called me from somebody’s phone today and said that he is being chained to the hospital bed ever since he was admitted there. They are not releasing him even to go to the toilet. He said that he was urinating in a plastic bottle,” Raihanath said. She added that Kappan now wants to somehow get discharged from the hospital. “How can a person be denied the most basic right to go to a toilet for days, that too when he is under treatment,” she asked. Kappan was admitted to a private medical college in Mathura on Wednesday after he collapsed in the bathroom of his jail cell on April 20. Raihanath said that Kappan has sustained injuries in his chin after he collapsed. “His chin is injured and he is having difficulties in taking food. He has been having fever for so many days now and is very weak as he is diabetic and has other health issues. I don’t know how long he will be able to endure all this,” she said. Raihanath and the Siddique Kappan Solidarity Committee had on Friday urged chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to immediately intervene to save the life of Kappan. Kappan and three others were arrested on October 5 when they were going to Hathras village in UP to report the alleged gang-rape and murder of a Dalit girl there. They were booked for sedition and under sections of the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/kappan-is-chained-to-hospital-bed-says-wife/articleshow/82235485.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Airport staff, though essential, barred from local trains||MUMBAI: The state government has not included airport workers in its latest list of ‘essential services staff’ who can travel by suburban local trains.From Thursday, hundreds of employees working at Mumbai airport for private airlines, airport operator and ground handling companies have been forced to rely on road transport for daily commute. “The staff keep the airport running, and they fall under essential services. They have the central government’s ‘airport entry pass’ to enter the airport for jobs like aircraft-fuelling, cleaning and baggage loading, and without them no flights will operate from Mumbai airport,’’ said an airport staffer. “Many reside in far-off places like Thane, Kalyan, Karjat, Kasara, Panvel, Pen, Vasai, Virar, Palghar and Dahanu. Since Thursday, they are not being allowed to enter railway stations. But Air India staff have been permitted to travel by local trains,’’ he added. Railway officials said they have followed state government instructions. “The ‘Break the Chain’ notification of April 21 clearly says that only government personnel (state/central/local), medical personnel and any individual in need of medical treatment or a specially-abled individual and a person accompanying the needy should be allowed on local trains,” said Sumit Thakur, chief PRO, Western Railway. “Security agencies cannot allow any other service provider to enter railway stations unless the government issues an amended notification.” The ‘Break the Chain’ order issued on April 13 did not include them, but the government amended the rule the next day and added “aviation..airlines, airports, maintenance, cargo, ground services, catering, fuelling and security” under essential services. This time around there has been no follow-up amendment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-airport-staff-though-essential-barred-from-local-trains/articleshow/82234396.cms||Manju V
---||Bareilly||Uttar Pradesh: Celebratory firing claims life of a 10-year old girl in Budaun||BAREILLY: A 10-year-old girl was allegedly shot dead in celebratory firing during a ceremony in Islamnagar area of UP’s Budaun district on Friday night. The incident was reported during the engagement of the son of the former village head of Nanderi village. Police said that close relatives and friends had gathered for the function when few people started firing in the air. One of the bullets, allegedly shot by Rambharose (38), hit their neighbour’s daughter, Anjali, who was standing on the roof of her house watching the celebrations. After being hit, she fell down on the floor while the accused and some other men fled from the spot. Anjali was rushed to the community health centre but she died within a few minutes of receiving treatment. Rambharose was booked under section 304 (culpable homicide) and was arrested along with a country-made pistol on Saturday afternoon from a bus stand. He was trying to flee Budaun. The victim was the daughter of a farmer and used to study in class III. There were more children in her house who were standing on the balcony, however, they escaped unscathed as several bullets were fired in the air. SHO Islamnagar police station, Bachchu Singh, confirmed that it was a case of death due to celebratory firing. “The accused and other guests in the celebrations were inebriated, as informed by the girl’s family, and were dancing. The accused didn’t have enmity with the girl’s family. We have registered another FIR against the accused as an illicit country-made pistol was recovered from him. He has been sent to 14 days judicial custody. We will also register an FIR against the father of the groom because he organised a party without permission and didn’t follow Covid guidelines,” Singh said. Easy availability of country-made weapons is leading to many such fatalities in the area. On Wednesday night, a 19-year-old youth was shot dead with a country-made pistol following an argument during a marriage ceremony in the neighbouring Bareilly district. In a similar incident last December, a youth was killed in celebratory firing during a wedding ceremony in Kakrala town of Budaun. And a 10-year-old boy was critically injured when revellers opened fire during a pre-wedding celebration in Lakhimpur Kheri district around the same time last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/celebratory-firing-claims-life-of-a-10-yo-girl-in-budaun/articleshow/82234887.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Pragya was working with a hospital in Nagpur, but had returned home to Balaghat during the restrictions. Later, when the Covid situation worsened and Covid patients increased, she started getting call from hospitals, asking her to rejoin. Getting transport was an issue due to the Covid 19 restrictions, but then she thought if she doesn’t report to duty it would be an injustice to her education. Hence, she decided to travel on her two-wheeler though there was a lot of resistance from her mother, a house wife, and father, who is a teacher. “They were worried due to the Covid situation and lockdown restrictions but then I was able to convince them,” said Pragya. She adds, “It was difficult as I also had to carry a lot of luggage on the Scooty. I started at around 9am and reached Nagpur at 3pm.” Pragya is now working for Covid patients at two places, one is Shantiniketan Nursing Home and second at Meditrina Hospital. “At both places, work requires me to interact with patients as I have to monitor their pulse, blood pressure, sugar, saturation level etc. Apart from my BHMS skills, I try to use my other skill that I am acquiring by studying for an MA Psychology from Ignou.” She has observed that most patients are depressed or afraid during Covid hospitalization. “So I talk to them, try to counsel and motivate them to be positive even as I monitor their parameters,” she says. “It’s a difficult job to be in PPE kits for 12 hours, as my first job at Shantiniketan is from 8am to 2pm, and from 2pm to 8pm I am at Meditrina. But I am proud to render my service to Covid patients, as the nation is seeing one of the most dangerous times in the pandemic,” she says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/doctor-drives-from-balaghat-to-city-joins-covid-19-duty/articleshow/82236035.cms||Ranjit Deshmukh
---||Pune||Educators moot small groups, committed teaching & internal marking to salvage next academic year||Pune: From restructuring the academic year to match with the central boards to including more and structured components of internal marking to reduce dependency on board examination, and to satellite centres for online education and using NGOs and other networks to reach all students, education experts from the state have said proper and prior planning is the only way to salvage the upcoming academic year for students in the state. Since last March, the Covid 19 pandemic has forced schools to close down with intermittent reopening, leading to poor learning outcomes in the students especially in rural areas. Teachers now feel the situation will lead to irreparable damage to the academic life of students. Mandar Shinde, education activist and conveyor Action for the Rights of Children (ARC), has suggested selection and training of education facilitators, worksheets, alternatives to school level sports and art classes, delivering books before reopening of the schools, special instruction for parents and satellite centres with online and other facilities where 10-15 students can come together and study to deal with the situation. “At such sub-centres, teachers should come on certain days and carry out some activities and evaluate. On other days, education can be continued through facilitators,” said Shinde. Amruta Prabhu, principal of The HDFC School said the education boards need not put all emphasis on exams and it is a perfect time to go for a holistic evaluation approach. “The Central Board of Secondary Education had followed a non-exam route a few years ago, where the Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation was considered for marking. That was a holistic approach of evaluation which was changed to board exams. However, Covid-19 has forced education boards to look at alternative evaluations and CCE is the best way forward. A common board pattern would be a good idea at the moment so that assessments are fair,” she said. Sheetal Bapat of Shyamchi Aai Foundation said the education department should focus on strengthening the teachers and equipping them with the right tools for bridge courses for clearing concepts of last year and orienting the students for the coming year through self learning and learner centric activities. Its members have suggested tools like worksheets, open book exams, assignments and use of simple technology solutions to measure and store progress of students is needed. Many NGOs and teachers across the state have done some amazing work in adopting learner centric teaching learning in rural areas. They felt the department should utilise this time to collaborate with all stakeholders to strengthen the teachers and make them more effective facilitators. They must also start working on a parallel technology solution for online assessments well in advance. Mahavir Mane, former state director of education, said wherever possible, schools must be reopened. “There are many remote villages where there are no Covid-19 cases. Schools here must reopen in the next academic year. The teachers should try to find accommodation within the village and teach the students,” he said. Ideas To Map The Next Session --- Efficient bridge courses so that students do not feel lost in the next class ----Plan a way to register children, which includes calling parents, making home visits, referring to the government’s data on birth-death records, anganwadi, Aadhaar so that schools have comprehensive data on students in each class -----Deliver books and workbooks before time if possible. This gives children time to go through the matter ---Assuming that the number of children attending school will be less, select and empower education assistants or volunteers at the parent and / or village level from now on ---Better infrastructure for technology enabled education and evaluation ---Include instructions for parents /volunteers (from the role of facilitator) ---Satellite centres for online education can be set up at the settlement level where eight to ten to fifteen children can come together ---Make use of NGOs instead of keeping them at bay in implementing learner-centred teaching --- A good set of worksheets for all subjects and all topics is needed  A planned distribution model of these worksheets must be done ---Start working on a parallel technology solution for online assessments well in advance A Lost Year ---In the current academic year, activities and programmes other than theoretical education were completely or partially closed. Also, children’s outdoor sports and art subjects were not given enough attention. Alternative planning is necessary for implementing all this in the next academic year. Apart from schools and teachers, governmental and social institutions can be used||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/educators-moot-small-groups-committed-teaching-internal-marking-to-salvage-next-academic-year/articleshow/82236037.cms||Ardhra Nair

Patil further demanded that the National Commission for Women inquire into the allegations against Sena MP and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut by a woman. The woman, in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had alleged harassment by Raut for eight years. The demands come in light of the CBI filing an FIR against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh. The former home minister was accused by former Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh of setting monthly collection targets of Rs 100 crore from bars for various Mumbai police officials, including assistant police inspector Sachin Waze. Waze, who was arrested in the Mansukh Hiran murder case, had said in a letter to the special NIA court that Parab had asked him to extort money from 50 BMC contractors. Waze is also an accused in the case related to placing of an explosives-laden SUV near the residence of businessman Mukesh Ambani in South Mumbai. “Though Parab issued a clarification, the truth will be known only when the CBI inquires into it. In his letter, Waze had referred to one Ghodawat. The CBI must also institute an inquiry against Ghodawat,” he said speaking to mediapersons in Pune. Rejecting labour minister and NCP leader Hasan Mushrif’s allegation the CBI inquiry and FIR against Deshmukh was a BJP conspiracy, Patil said it was Singh who had approached Supreme Court but was directed to the high court saying the issue was serious. “It is the HC that ordered a CBI inquiry and the plea filed by Deshmukh and the state government against the order was rejected by the apex court. What has all of this got to do with the BJP?” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cbi-should-probe-parab-womens-panel-raut-bjp/articleshow/82235489.cms||---

The association has asked the ministry to ensure that the admissions to degree and various professional courses are not held until the CBSE results are out so that the students will not lose opportunities in pursuing higher education. The letter pointed out that Class XII exams of Kerala board would be completed soon and the results will be out at the earliest increasing the insecurity of the CBSE students. The association also requested the ministry to clear the uncertainty over the conduct of exams and the method of evaluation at the earliest as the board had postponed the exams twice in the wake of the pandemic. The letter said the admissions to the degree and professional courses, which are not coming under the entrance examination, are made by the respective states as per their schedule. “The CBSE board examination of Class XII happened to be postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic situation. Consequently, the publication of the result also may be delayed. In the meantime, state governments are proceeding with the senior secondary examination and the admission to degree courses will be commencing after the publishing of the results. If the admission is completed before the publication of the CBSE XII results, CBSE students will be losing their chance for admission to degree/professional courses. In order to avoid such injustice to CBSE students, the government may kindly issue necessary instructions to the state governments directing the commencement of admission only after the publication of the CBSE Class XII result,” said the letter signed by TPM Ibrahim Khan, president of Kerala CBSE School Management Association. The association also said that if the promotion of Class X students is delayed there is chance of students migrating from CBSE schools to state schools. The Class X exams stand cancelled and the CBSE is yet to announce how the assessment scheme will be held to promote students to Class XI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/association-writes-to-min-on-cbse-class-xii-exams/articleshow/82235490.cms||---

The party also demanded a high-level independent probe into the “multi-crore scam of creating scarcity of gunny bags made of jute and multi-crore scandal in purchase of plastic bags in their place”. The party leaders submitted memorandums to the respective deputy commissioners in their districts, addressed to Punjab governor. The memorandum said farmers were suffering in mandis across the state as the Punjab government had failed to make timely arrangements for the wheat season. Farmers were forced to camp in miserable conditions at procurement centres, it said, adding that a huge amount of wheat was lying in the open in mandis as it had not been lifted due to lack of gunny bags. The party also mentioned that the state government has failed to timely float tenders for gunny bags. Punjab was also pipped by Haryana in placing orders for used gunny bags, it added. The Punjab government was now resorting to purchase plastic bags and a “multi-crore scandal” was in the offing in this purchase, said the Akalis. The SAD demanded a high-level independent probe in this scam and said that before ordering this probe, Ashu should be sacked from his post. They also urged the Punjab governor to issue suitable directions to the Punjab government to immediately take corrective measures to reduce pain of farmers of the state. The memorandum also said apart from lack of basic facilities in mandis, farmers were facing a huge problem in getting payment of their produce as Punjab government portal was not working properly and entries of wheat purchased were not being made. Farmers were also facing a problem of shortage of space in mandis due to which they were forced to store crops in their houses, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-seeks-sacking-of-minister-for-poor-mandi-arrangements/articleshow/82236077.cms||---

He has been on the run after murdering his wife at Nanakmatta town of neighbouring Uttarakhand's Udham Singh Nagar in 2018, and police were unable to trace him for months. Uttarakhand police also announced a cash reward of Rs 5,000. Recently, police came to know that he was hiding inside a farmhouse built illegally on a forest land on the banks of Sharda river in Majhara village. When the team from Nanakmatta led by SI Jitendra Kumar along with four constables reached Pilibhit and raided the place at midnight, Singh and his sons, Guru and Krishna, managed to escape. The cops then came under attack from Singh's men. Senior cops from Uttarakhand visited the spot and met Pilibhit SP Kirit Kumar on Saturday. Puranpur circle officer (CO) Lallan Singh told TOI, “Uttarakhand police informed us about the incident at 2.30am and I left for the spot with my team. An AK-47 rifle was snatched by one of the accused and it is still missing." "We have registered an FIR against Jaswant Singh, his sons and unidentified persons under relevant sections of IPC. The district's borders have been sealed and SSB officials informed. Our teams along with Uttarakhand police are looking for the accused,” the CO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/uttarakhand-police-team-comes-under-attack-during-raid-in-search-of-murder-accused-in-up/articleshow/82234894.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The court said that the filling up of DySP posts through direct appointment shall be subject to the final orders that may be made in these petitions. The state government had decided to fill DySP posts, 50% through direct recruitment and 50% by promotions. Police officers have sought a direction from the high court to the state government to fill the DySP posts entirely through promotions. The state government has sanctioned 40 DySP posts to Goa police, out of which 21 are proposed to be filled by direct recruitment. All direct recruitment posts are vacant whereas promotional posts have been filled. The police inspectors have prayed to the court to fill all 21 vacant DySP posts through promotions. In 1997, the state government had decided to fill up the DySP posts through 80% promotion and 20% through direct recruitment. Later in 2011, the state government changed the decision and decided to make it 50:50 % via direct and promotional filling of DySP vacancies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/high-court-admits-plea-by-pis-against-direct-hiring-of-dysps/articleshow/82236078.cms||---
---||Delhi||Arvind Kejriwal’s SOS to CMs: Please send us your spare oxygen||NEW DELHI: With the Covid-ravaged city still in the grip of an oxygen scarcity, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal sent an SOS to all the states requesting them for any spare gas they had. In a letter to the CMs on Saturday, Kejriwal said he would be grateful if the states could provide Delhi with any amount of oxygen, along with tankers, transportation being a major problem behind the shortage. He asked for this request to be treated as an SOS to save the capital. Meanwhile, Delhi government also decided to increase the number of officers manning the oxygen control room amid complaints from hospitals that the officers weren’t able to respond to all the messages for help. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia visited the oxygen control room on Friday midnight to take stock. In the letter to chief ministers, Kejriwal said that while the central government was helping Delhi with regard to the oxygen crisis, the intensity of the pandemic was so severe that the supply was proving inadequate. Therefore, Kejriwal said, “I am writing to all chief ministers requesting them to provide oxygen to Delhi if they have any spare.” Explaining the reasons for the scarcity, the chief minister wrote, “Delhi does not produce any oxygen. Due to the severe rise in corona cases in the last few days, many hospitals in the national capital have run out of oxygen. Daily supplies of oxygen to Delhi are woefully short of our requirements.” He added, “Therefore, I would be grateful if you could provide us with any oxygen, along with tankers, from your state or any organisation in your state. Kindly treat this as an SOS. I would be personally grateful for your support.” A Delhi government official explained that there was a vast shortage of cryogenic tankers across the country and since Delhi was a non-industrial state, it did not have a ready fleet of cryogenic tankers, like some states with iron and steel and petrochemical industries. Kejriwal has been saying that all states should come together to help each other out at this crucial hour. Calling the current coronavirus wave in thee country a collective crisis, he said India would not survive if people split themselves into Haryana, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, West Bengal. Recently, Delhi government set up a 24x7 control room led by an IAS officer. It also operates a helpdesk manned by a sub-divisional magistrate-level officer and eight other officers to redress the grievances and complaints received from private hospitals and those run by the central and Delhi governments. An official claimed that those manning the control room were “going crazy with the workload”. After his late-night visit to the control room on Friday, Sisodia tweeted “The team lead by IAS officer Vijay Bidhuri is working hard to respond to all SOS calls from hospitals if their vendor has not met their demand for oxygen or there is urgent need. Every call is an emergency call to save lives.” An official later said that the number of officials manning the control room was increased to ensure they were able to handle the increasing calls for help more quickly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kejriwals-sos-to-cms-please-send-us-your-spare-oxygen/articleshow/82235496.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Goa||Goa: Chaos at Peddem over person’s ‘entry’ in poll strong room||SALIGAO: A day after the Mapusa municipal elections, tense moments were witnessed at Peddem after polling agents and candidates alleged that an unauthorised person had gained entry into the strong room where the ballot boxes had been stored. On Saturday, independent candidate John Lobo filed a complaint with the Mapusa police station, stating that the person entered the room to retrieve his laptop without any permission for the admission from the authorities concerned. Polling agents and candidates gathered at the stadium and demanded to know as to how the unauthorised person was given entry inside the strong room. They also claimed that the room was left unguarded. Police were also summoned to bring the situation under control. “The person entered the strong room where the sealed ballot boxes had been stored. When candidates learnt of the same, we rushed to the spot,” Lobo told TOI. Sources said that the unauthorised person is a staffer working in the deputy collector’s office, and when the candidates questioned him, he was reluctant to divulge any information. Later, the staffer revealed that he had forgotten his laptop inside the strong room and had gone to fetch it. The candidates said the man failed to make an entry in the book to record his visit inside the room. A few candidates, who were later allowed inside the counting hall in Peddem, Mapusa, said they found the ballot boxes intact. “There are two crucial days left before the counting of votes, and we have the right to question the authorities. I cannot understand how this person was allowed to enter inside without even signing on the entry book,” said Lobo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/chaos-at-peddem-over-persons-entry-in-poll-strong-room/articleshow/82236097.cms||---

According to records, the Vasai-Virar Municipal Corporation’s fire brigade received a call from Vijay Vallabh Hospital at 3.13 am. The fire brigade vehicle arrived at the hospital at 3.18 am. The fire was extinguished at 3.45 am. A fire officer said that two nurses in the ICU had noticed sparks from the AC unit placed behind their table. They alerted other colleagues at the hospital and used fire extinguishers to control the sparks. When things went out of control, they called up the fire brigade by which time about 15 minutes had been lost, fire officials said. By the time firemen arrived at the spot, there were 13 charred bodies. A fireman said that the hospital employees, while using fire extinguishers, should have simultaneously called up the fire brigade as sparks had been noticed in the ICU that requires rapid response. The hospital staff had undergone training in fire safety . The staff managed to rescue four patients who were near the exit. Among these, two women were the first to be rescued. They did not sustain burn injuries, but were gasping for breath as oxygen supply in the ICU had stopped due to power failure. The condition of these women is now stable and their oxygen levels are being monitored. Shivaji Wilkar (56), who had been rescued with burn injuries, died later at a hospital in Vasai. Nirav Sampat (31) died while being moved to a hospital in Byculla for severe burn injuries.

---||Delhi||Former Delhi BJP MLA moves Supreme Court for removal of farmers from border||NEW DELHI: Former Delhi BJP MLA Nand Kishore Garg has approached the Supreme Court seeking its direction to Centre and Delhi government to take immediate action for removal of a group of farmers protesting against the farm laws at Delhi border particularly in view of the recent surge in Covid-19 cases. Garg, who claims to have left active politics and is doing social work, said that the apex court cannot be a “silent spectator to such agitational and confrontational drama” of the protesters who are blocking the entire vehicular and pedestrian movement from the road connecting the national capital to various states. “It is submitted that the Constitution of our country is above every one and no one is above the Constitution. However, the protester farmers are having no deference to the judicial institution like this Court as well as the legislatures of our country. These protesters are flouting the rules and regulations including the order and judgment passed by this Hon’ble Court from time to time holding that the public places must not be allowed to obstruct the fundamental rights of the other common citizen.” The apex court is already examining the issue and has sought response from the Centre and Delhi government.  The court has repeatedly said that people are entitled to hold protests but they cannot block public roads for a long time inconveniencing the larger public. Referring to the apex court's previous orders including the verdict on Shaheen Bagh protest, Garg said the protesting farmers are acting against the order and judgment of this Court without any fear and pleaded the court to intervene. "It is submitted that the state machineries are muted spectators to the shameless violation of the law of the land. The petitioner seeks inter alia for laying down the comprehensive and exhaustive guidelines arising out of recurring protests occurring on a regular interval in our country at behest of organization/group/community which often leads to unsavory situations like the obstruction of arterial public places by holding rallies or protests," the petition said. "It is further submitted that such illegal demonstration, which is being done at the cost of hardship of the common people of the locality, and common people are hopelessly handicapped for the enjoyment of their fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution of India. In addition to the said obstruction, the state law enforcement machinery is being held hostage to the whims and fancies of the protesters. As such the state machinery are not discharging its duties as per the law, the common people are approaching to the law enforcement authorities for the redressal and addressal of their grievance, but the common people are not getting any kind of relief and reprieve in this case," the petition said. "It is further submitted that the spectacle of devastating politically motivated farmer protest poses a serious question on the institutional efficacy of the respondents for the purpose of protection of the fundamental rights of the common citizen in conformity to the constitutional obligations and statutory obligations," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/former-mla-moves-sc-for-removal-of-farmers-from-border/articleshow/82236100.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Kotkapura: Congress in two minds over challenging order||Chandigarh: On the politically volatile issue of the Kotkapura firing case, Punjab Congress seems to be in two minds as to whether it should challenge the high court’s order to quash the probe report. It could be termed as a move that could delay the matter at a time when the elections are round the corner. Congress Rajya Sabha MP Partap Bajwa suggested, “A new three-member SIT should be constituted and the investigation should be concluded at the earliest, preferably within a month and subsequently after filing of challan, an application should be filed before the trial court requesting for an expeditious trial preferably on a day-to-day basis.” Earlier, chief minister Amarinder Singh had announced that the decision would be challenged in the Supreme Court. But the detailed order is believed to be making a section of the party leaders get second thoughts. Besides, Kunwar Vijay Pratap, the police officer who conducted the probe too has since resigned. Bajwa added, “I had suggested earlier that the present government should constitute a new SIT that would complete the investigation within a span of one month and file the challan before the trial court. The high court has also made similar observations by directing that the investigation of these FIRs should be concluded as expeditiously as possible, preferably within a period of six months from the date of constitution of SIT.” Earlier, on April 10, terming the probe into the Kotkapura firing case as “totally fair, impartial and unbiased”, the chief minister had said his government will challenge in the Supreme Court any orders of the high court for quashing the investigation of the Punjab Police SIT or removing its chief. A senior Punjab Congress leader added, “For one, the decision to challenge the order could result in further delay. Besides, since most of the investigation has already been done, a new SIT with a specific deadline may be able to take things to a logical conclusion.” “The detailed order has thrown up new issues and the chief minister is likely to make an announcement in a day or two. Where it is an emotive issue and everyone wants closure, there are also political implications,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/kotkapura-congress-in-two-minds-over-challenging-order/articleshow/82236095.cms||---

---||Delhi||Centre told to allocate Delhi’s quota of oxygen from nearby plants||NEW DELHI: Delhi government said on Saturday that Delhi High Court pulled up the Centre and asked it to immediately examine re-allocating Delhi’s quota of oxygen from nearby plants. Many hospitals in Delhi are facing acute oxygen crisis due to shortage of supply, which has caused a face-off between the AAP government and the Centre. The high court on Saturday heard a hospital’s petition over shortage of oxygen for critical Covid patients. During the proceedings, Delhi government stated that as against 480 MT of oxygen allocated, only 309 MT was received by Delhi on April 23, which was the main cause behind the crisis in Delhi’s hospitals. The government also stated that in the revised allocation plan devised by the central government, 102 MT of supply for Delhi has been allocated to plants located far away in Odisha and West Bengal. “This was done without the Centre making any corresponding arrangement for tankers to supply this oxygen or any consultative process with Delhi government,” the government said in a statement. “Taking this into account, the high court pulled up the SG and directed him to ask the empowered group of the central government to re-examine this plan and to ensure plants closer to Delhi are allocated so that same tankers can make higher number of trips.” In the allocation plan for Delhi before April 21, one of the suppliers, INOX, was allotted 140 MT from its plants nearby Delhi. Earlier, on some days, INOX supplied even more than 140 MT. “However, in the revised plan issued by the central government on April 21, supply from INOX from nearby plants was suddenly curtailed to 100 MT, whereas faraway plants that are in no position to supply to Delhi were assigned over 100 MT,” the government stated. Delhi government said that the Centre threw its hands up when asked why adequate cryogenic tankers have not been arranged for supply of oxygen from faraway plants. The government submitted that as on date, there is a vast shortage of cryogenic tankers across the country and the Centre is best placed to allocate adequate capacity to each state or if required import more tankers. “Being a non-industrial state, Delhi does not have a ready fleet of cryogenic tankers like many other industrial states. To this, central officials once again evaded any kind of responsibility and said that some states are taking care of their tanker requirements and therefore, Delhi should also do so,” the government said. “The high court directed the Centre to work closely with Delhi government and use any means possible to arrange an adequate number of cryogenic tankers. Delhi government assured the court that it will work collaboratively with Centre to press more cryogenic tankers into service, even as it continues to demand the Centre to re-allocate its quota to nearby plants generating medical oxygen,” the government stated. A government source said that to enhance the availability of oxygen, eight pressure swing adsorption oxygen plants were being installed in Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-told-to-allocate-nearby-plants-delhi/articleshow/82235503.cms||---

The submission of the sports marks component will also be accepted online by the board this year. The board has taken many of its processes involving data submission by schools online in recent years. Goa Board had upgraded its website some years ago, with assistance under a central government scheme, which has helped shift many of its data exchange functions with schools online. This has served as a major aid during the pandemic, which demands reduced physical contact. Earlier, the board had announced that schools will also be able to download the students’ hall tickets online for the Class X and XII public exams, reducing physical contact further. All of this data exchange and distribution of hall tickets took place physically until recent years. “All the heads of the schools are hereby informed to upload internal assessment marks/grades of school assessment subjects and sports merit marks of SSC/HSSC examination on the web portal on or before May 15, 2021. It is informed that online service of feeding of students marks is operational,” Goa Board secretary Geraldina Mendes has told schools. For the 2021 public examinations, earlier schools were also asked by Goa Board to carry out submission of data of students answering the Class X and XII exams online. This year, around 23,400 students have registered for the Class X exam and 19,200 students for the Class XII exams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/schools-to-submit-internal-marks-via-online-mode/articleshow/82236101.cms||---

Police identified the deceased as Soorya, wife of Sunilkumar (Binukumar) of Binu Nivas, Vaipinkara, Puliyoor Vanchi Thekku, Thodiyoor, and her son Adidev. The child’s neck was found slit. The initial assumption points to the mother murdering the child before committing suicide, police said. Sunilkumar, who runs a shop at Kollam, his wife and son were staying at their house at Edakulangara. The relatives had seen Soorya and her son till 3pm on Friday at their house. But by 7:30pm, they found the doors of the house remaining closed . As there was no response when they knocked, the relatives with the assistance of local residents broke the window panes, only to see the mother and the child lying dead in their bedroom. Police squad led by Karunagappally ACP Sajeev and circle inspector Vincent arrived at the spot and conducted the inquest. As it was late in the night, police didn’t shift the body for autopsy. On Saturday, forensic experts from Kollam examined the bodies and gathered details. The bodies were later shifted to Parippally medical college hospital mortuary for postmortem examination. Police team comprising sub-inspectors Umesh Jones Raj, Santhu , CPOs Rajeesh, Shinas, and Shakkeela were also part of the team which completed the formalities for facilitating the autopsy. It seems to be a case of suicide based on the note recovered from Soorya’s bag, police said. The suicide note stated that debt incurred by the family prompted the young mother to resort to the extreme step. More details will be known only after the autopsy result is received, police added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/woman-child-found-dead-near-karunagappally/articleshow/82235508.cms||---

The hospital had reported 25 deaths in 24 hours on Friday.Dr Rana said that deaths were being reported mostly in very severe patients. “We have more than 500 patients admitted in the hospital. Most of them have severe symptoms requiring critical care. Deaths can happen despite best possible treatment in such cases,” the hospital chairman said. He added that in some cases, patients are rushed to the hospital when the chances of survival are nil. “We are witnessing fatalities in all age groups but predominantly in persons with comorbidities,” he added.The multispecialty private hospital, like many other medical institutions, has been facing a serious oxygen crisis with supplies running late almost daily. However, Dr Rana said ascribing the fatalities caused by Covid-19 to the erratic oxygen supply may be wrong. “The supply hasn’t finished completely in our hospital even once. However, there have been occasions when we have had to switch to manual ventilation—intermittent manual compression of a gas-filled reservoir bag to force gases into a patient’s lungs—to ensure patients survive despite low pressure,” he said.Ganga Ram had 29 patients on invasive ventilation as of 1pm on Saturday. To run ventilators, the hospital said, the oxygen reservoir should have 3,000 cubic metres of oxygen. “We are getting supplies of 500 to 1,500 cubic metres only,” a senior official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/supply-never-fully-ended-ganga-ram/articleshow/82235509.cms||---

The meeting also sought to understand the problems that doctors encounter everyday while dealing with the alarming rise in Covid-19 caseload. The hotpots reported in the surveillance survey of the department of preventive and social medicines of Goa Medical College (GMC) have gone up from 139 to 183. “It was recommended that if the government doesn’t want to have further rise in hotspots, the containment measures are necessary,” said a health officer who was part of the meeting. On Friday, South Goa collector Ruchika Katyal had issued an order declaring four houses—three in Quepem taluka and one in Canacona—as micro containment zones after several occupants were found positive for Covid-19. Health officers also told the chief minister that they have burnt out and their burden can be scaled down if members of the Indian Medical Council (IMA)-Goa chapter are roped in to help. One of the suggestions was that the workload of government doctors be cut down immediately, and it could be done by bringing in experts from the directorate of health services and members of IMA. “The government doctors whether posted in hospitals or health centres are worn out, they need help,” a health official said. Currently, IMA offers teleconsultation for patients in home isolation. Another officer said the delays caused in transferring patients due to inadequate number of ambulances can prove fatal, and more ambulances need to be made available for transfer of patients in home isolation. Over the last few days, several cases have come to light of patients who were in home isolation but were then rushed to hospital in dire condition and died within a few hours. Over the last 24 hours, 566 patients were placed in home isolation. More ambulances need to be made available for centres that have a high caseload. The ambulances are also required for transfer of bodies of people who have succumbed to the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/health-officials-ask-cm-to-rope-in-ima-doctors/articleshow/82236118.cms||---

Six of the seven khazan land parcels in Pernem taluka are owned by private individuals and only one is under government ownership. Similarly, in Bicholim taluka, all 12 of the khazan land parcels are partly owned by the comunidade and partly by private individuals and religious institutions. The situation is similar in the case of 28 khazan land properties of Tiswadi taluka and 25 properties in Salcete taluka, as per the state government records. In Bardez taluka, of the 16 khazan land parcels, in five the ownership is either with private parties or jointly with the comunidade and private individuals. The state government is currently in the process of finalising the draft Khazan Management Plan, the first such document. The khazan lands were originally floodplains, which were reclaimed for cultivation by the early settlers in Goa almost 3,000 years ago. The saline floodplains were reclaimed through an intricate system of bunds and sluice gates, which help keep the salinity of the land in check, thereby making it suitable for cultivation. All eight khazan land parcels in Canacona taluka, admeasuring five lakh sqms are owned by private persons. The largest number of 596 khazan plots, together admeasuring 9 lakh sqms are, however, located in Mormugao and nearly all these properties are with the local comunidade. In Ponda too, the situation is better with only four of the 16 khazan land parcels being under private control. Last year, Goa filed a representation before the Union environment ministry to amend the CRZ notification 2011 so as to limit the high tide line (HTL) up to the bund or a sluice gate constructed prior to the CRZ notification of 1991. This representation was approved by the National Coastal Zone Management Authority and these sluice gates systems will now be protected as part of Goa’s coastal zone management plan. However, in many areas, the sluice gates as well as the bunds are lying in dire straits and a number of requests for their repairs are pending with the water resources department. Khazan lands are being left fallow as the salinity levels increase due to the damage to the sluice gates and bunds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/many-khazan-lands-now-in-hands-of-private-owners/articleshow/82236103.cms||---

---||Delhi||Supplying to hosps as per given plan: Firm||New Delhi/ Mumbai: Maintaining it has been supplying medical oxygen in line with the supply plan given to it, industrial gas supplier INOX Air Products has written to the Delhi government pointing out that the Kejriwal administration had instructed it to supply oxygen to 17 hospitals as against its contract with 45 hospitals.In a letter to Delhi health department, the company pointed to two orders issued by Delhi government on Thursday and Friday, asking it to provide daily supplies to 17 hospitals including Max, Patparganj, Jaipur Golden and Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, among others, with the allocation adding up to 98 metric tonnes of the 105 MT it is to supply to Delhi. The Centre had revised the firm’s daily allocation for Delhi to 105 MT.The firm said catering to the 17 hospitals specified by the Delhi government will mean the other hospitals — with which it has existing contracts — will need other suppliers. It also claimed to be supplying oxygen in excess of quota in the past few days.“We reiterate that INOX has contractual obligations to supply LMO (liquid medical oxygen) to 45 hospitals…we request you to kindly allocate the responsibility of supplying LMO to the balance 28 hospitals to other gas suppliers listed in your order dated 23 April,” it said, adding the company will have to inform the remaining 28 hospitals following a communication from the Delhi government.Further, INOX said that it did not have contracts with Holy Family, UK Hospital and Santosh Hospital, as was mentioned by Delhi government on Thursday and suggested that other gas suppliers should be asked to provide oxygen.The letter came amid complaints over non-availability of oxygen from the Delhi government, an issue that has also been taken up in Delhi High Court. The court had earlier pulled up the INOX, but the company refused to comment on the matter, when contacted by TOI, saying the matter is sub-judice.In the letter, INOX has said that against the pre-Covid times demand of 30-40 metric tonnes a day, the requirement had shot up exponentially to 120-130 MT and it was now facing capacity constraints at its plants, despite ramping up production.The company said that it has sought to meet the requirement and against the quota of 100 MT fixed for it by the Centre on April 18, it has supplied anywhere between 115 MT and 147 MT during April 18 to 21. While maintaining that it is committed to meet the 105 MT target fixed for it on April 21, the demand from hospitals was much more.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/supplying-to-hosps-as-per-given-plan-firm/articleshow/82235515.cms||---
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Muzaffarnagar man alleges his pregnant wife died due to hospital negligence||MEERUT: A heart rending video of a man named Sachin Saini, from Muzaffarnagar, has gone viral on Whatsapp. In the video he alleges that his 30-year-old wife who was six-months pregnant died due to hospital negligence. In the five-minute video he claims that his wife was Covid negative but was admitted in the hospital’s Covid ward where she died. Looking very disturbed and broken Saini, in the video, shows his wife’s negative RT PCR report. “Despite being Covid negative and six-months pregnant, my wife was admitted to a Covid ward where she died. The medical college staff has killed my wife and my kid,” Saini can be heard saying in the video. The concerned hospital on the other hand refuted all charges. Dr Brigadier GS Manchanda, principal Muzaffarnagar Medical College, issued an official statement on this matter: “A 30-year-old woman named Anjali was admitted to our hospital on Friday. She was pregnant. Her rapid antigen test was positive. And as per the guidelines of the UP government pregnant women need to be treated on priority, so she was immediately admitted to the Covid ward. She was symptomatic with cough, sore throat and breathing problems. Her oxygen level (SPO2) was 50%. She was admitted to the ICU but unfortunately could not survive.” Speaking to TOI, Saini said, “The fact is that neither the district hospital nor the medical college wanted to take the responsibility of my wife. On Wednesday, her condition began to deteriorate as she was diagnosed with pneumonia. I rushed her to the medical college where her antigen report came negative. The doctors there advised me to take her to the district hospital as they have better facilities for pregnant women. So, I took her there. Another antigen test was conducted in the district hospital which showed her positive but I think they manipulated the report and she was immediately referred back to the medical college. I brought her back on Friday morning but they admitted her in a Covid ward and waited for her to die.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/muzaffarnagar-man-alleges-his-pregnant-wife-died-due-to-hospital-negligence/articleshow/82234920.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Bed preference to be given to 60+ with co-morbidities||KOLKATA: The state health department and the state health commission on Saturday announced a slew of measures to not only increase Covid beds in hospitals but also free up currently occupied ones by announcing more stringent parameters to ensure optimal use of hospital beds that continue to be in short supply due to the heavy rush of patients. The number of Covid beds stood at 9,646 on Saturday. While the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission has asked all hospitals to ramp up Covid bed count to 60% of licensed ones, the state health department has asked the government to prioritise admission of patients requiring oxygen support. “Covid patients, who are above 60 and have co-morbidity and respiratory distress requiring oxygen support, will get preference for hospitalization. Patients who no longer require oxygen support or serious hospitalisation will be shifted to safe homes and satellite centres attached to hospitals,” a health department official said, adding the move would free up unnecessarily-occupied beds so that those could be used to treat critical patients. The decision followed complaints from certain quarters that affluent individuals, who had tested Covid positive but did not require hospitalisation, were occupying beds in private and government hospitals. “Patients with mild symptoms or even asymptomatic ones are admitted now. That is criminal wastage of precious resources in short supply,” said a doctor, welcoming the government move. But another doctor pointed out that a patient who did not have breathing distress yet could have other Covid complications that might demand hospitalisation. The commission’s order to convert 60% licensed beds for Covid patients may potentially increase the bed count by two-three times. Some hospitals have converted 40%-50% beds for Covid care. But the facilities said they needed to get necessary drugs and oxygen, which were also in short supply. “Almost 50% of our beds are for Covid care now. But we will scale it up further. We can do so once the last non-Covid patient there is discharged,” said Simmardeep Gill, COO, CK Birla Hospitals CMRI. “With the rising number of cases, there is no option but to increase Covid beds. We would try to make it 60%,” said Sudipta Mitra, CEO, Peerless Hospital. Medica, which has converted 214 out of its 400 beds for Covid care, plans to take over a stadium. “From 50 beds about four weeks ago, we have scaled it up to 400. Our major thrust will be on critical care beds and so, we are trying for 100 such beds in our Mukundapur facility,” said Rupak Barua, Group CEO, AMRI Hospitals. “We have turned 75% of our beds for Covid. We are trying to expand beds in satellite facilities,” said Belle Vue Clinic CEO Pradip Tondon. RNTIICS started installing gadgets and creating negative pressure in non-Covid areas to be used for Covid care. “We would strive towards adding to the 160 Covid beds. We would ask for some time,” said R Venkatesh, zonal director, (East), Narayana Health.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bed-preference-to-be-given-to-60-with-co-morbidities/articleshow/82235528.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Nurses steal dying patient's Remdesivir, try to auction it||MEERUT: Two male staff nurses of a prominent private hospital in Meerut were arrested on Saturday for allegedly trying to sell Remdesivir injection allotted to a patient who never got it and died due to Covid-19 a few days ago for Rs 32,000 in the "open market". The medicine, which costs about Rs 900-Rs 2000, was put up for auction and the winning bid was Rs 25,000. But unknown to the duo, it was placed by cops pretending to be distressed relatives of a patient. The patient, Shobhit Jain, was to be administered the injection due to his critical condition. He got three doses but the fourth was pocketed by the two nurses. And when Jain died, they started looking for customers. Bids were invited and the deal was finally struck at Rs 25,000. Just that the buyers were local policemen who had laid the trap. “Our surveillance team and policemen were working on the case after a tip-off. The price negotiation went on for seven days. They (the nurses) had quoted Rs 32,000. The injection was meant for one Shobhit Jain. But he died and the vial was diverted. We have arrested the nurses, Abid Khan and Ankit Sharma," said Ajay Sahani, SSP, Meerut. He added: “After the deal was struck, our team reached the hospital and asked for the injection. When the nurses got to know it was cops who had come for the medicine, they tried to flee but we caught them. Six security guards deployed there tried to protect the duo but they were overpowered by the police team.” The guards were also arrested. All of them have been booked under IPC sections 420 (cheating), 147 (rioting), 342 (wrongful confinement), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), and 120-B (criminal conspiracy). Sections of Drugs and Cosmetics Act and Epidemic Diseases Act were also invoked against them. The hospital management, meanwhile, said it was an “isolated incident” and that they had no information about it. They, however, supported the police action. “It was an isolated case and not a practice as claimed by the police. And as the policemen were in plain clothes carrying weapons, the guards on duty tried to stop them," said Dr Atul Krishna, trustee of Subharti KKB Charitable Trust, which runs the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/nurses-pilfer-remdesiver-meant-for-dying-patient-auction-it/articleshow/82234921.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Covid+ve house help ‘attacks’ SoBo woman||Mumbai: A Gamdevi resident was attacked with a sharp object allegedly by her domestic help at her residence on Friday morning. While Bharti Vora (58) sustained injuries on the neck and throat, the alleged attacker, Deep Chand Sahani (30), also has wounds on the body and has been admitted to hospital where he has tested positive for Covid, the police said. On Friday morning, Bharti’s husband, Bipin, a cloth merchant, left for his shop located close to their home. Soon after, he rushed home after a neighbour alerted him that she had heard Bharti screaming for help. “He rushed home to find her plonked on the floor of the kitchen, bleeding from the neck,” said a police officer. “Bharti told her husband that their house help had attacked her and was hiding in the bathroom.” Even as Bharti was being rushed to hospital, the police reached the place. They broke open the bathroom door to find Sahani lying in a semi-conscious state, with an injury on the neck. A “cutter” used in the attack has been recovered besides a knife, said senior inspector of Gamdevi police station R G Rajbhar. Another official said the weapon is quite similar to the paper-cutter. While Bharti, who had been admitted to Breach Candy Hospital, was discharged late on Friday, Sahani has been admitted to the state-run JJ hospital. “He has tested positive for Covid,” the officer confirmed. The police said they are still to establish the motive behind the attack. “We are still to record Bharti and Sahani’s statements,” the officer said, adding that Sahani has been charged with attempt to murder. Sahani used to live with the Vora couple at their 19th floor flat in Vaibhav Apartments. After working at Bipin’s shop for five years, he had been asked to work at their home for the last couple of months. Bipin has at least 30 employees at his shop, said the police. The couple has two daughters who are married.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-covidve-house-help-attacks-sobo-woman/articleshow/82237122.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Goa||Don’t hamper ore movement, truckers warned||PANAJI: The directorate of mines and geology has warned truck owners and their associations that they will be debarred from transporting the e-auctioned or regular iron ore if they do not allow smooth transportation of the ore. Director of mines and geology Vivek H P said that it has been brought to the notice of the department that some associations of truck owners are hampering the smooth transportation of the e-auctioned ore, stating that they have exclusive rights to transport the ore that is located within the jurisdiction of these associations, thereby restricting trucks belonging to other associations from transporting the ore. This has been causing hindrance and delay in the timely transportation of the Supreme Court mandated ore transportation, said Vivek. The director of mines said that the department is regularly conducting e-auctions of the iron ore declared to be illegally mined, the custody of which is given to the state government by the Supreme Court in the terms of its order dated April 21, 2014, for appropriating the sale proceeds of the ore. “All the truck associations are therefore hereby informed that there shall be no selective restriction on any truck being used for transportation of any e-auctioned ore anywhere, except that of North Goa-registered trucks being used in South Goa and vice-versa. However, in case of inter-district transportation of ore, this restriction shall be relaxed,” the director of mines stated. He also said that all the truck associations and truck owners should take note of the instructions, “failing which strict action will be taken against the erring associations, truck owners, including debarring them from transporting ore from future e-auctions/regular ore transportation”, which will also include civil and criminal action for violating the orders of the apex court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dont-hamper-ore-movement-truckers-warned/articleshow/82236111.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa: Two taxi operators held for attacking TV crew at Nerul||PANAJI: Porvorim police on Saturday arrested two taxi operators for allegedly assaulting members of a television crew and committing theft at the location where the crew was shooting in Nerul. The assault took place over the television crew hiring taxis from Maharashtra. Porvorim PI Ninad Deulkar said that they had arrested two members of a taxi association, Laximan Korgaonkar and Sunil Naik. They were later released on bail, he said. The complainant said that a crew of around 40 members had arrived in Goa for the shooting of a TV serial. The complainant said that on Friday, at around 4pm, while the shooting was in progress, around 20 people, including two women who are residents of Nerul, entered the compound of the villa and objected to the use of taxis from Maharashtra, when there was a taxi strike on in Goa. When the shooting coordinator attempted to talk to the group, they were not ready to listen, the complainant said. “One of my colleagues started recording a video on his cellphone of what was happening as we have to report to our office if any incident occurred on the shooting location, due to which the shoot is disrupted. While the video was being taken, a man of around 50 years snatched my colleague’s cellphone, and they started verbally abusing and assaulting us,” the complainant said. “All the 20 people were carrying stones and sticks. They also started throwing our belongings like bags, tables around and damaging our laptops and other equipment by throwing stones. Two colleagues were injured in the assault and a gold chain weighing approximately 20gm is missing,” the complainant said.

---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Patients’ families ‘loot’ oxygen consignment at Meerut hospital||MEERUT: As the truck carrying 400 oxygen cylinders rolled into the Lala Lajpat Rai Medical College (LLRM) in Meerut on Friday night, chaos ensued. In a state of panic over oxygen reserves, families of Covid-19 patients fell over themselves to grab cylinders before they could be taken in. “It was because of apprehensions that piped oxygen supply could get exhausted that some relatives took cylinders and placed them near their patients,” LLRM principal Dr Gyanender Kumar told TOI. As the “loot” took place, hospital staff reportedly stood by. “I had to intervene and convince families to return the cylinders. None of the cylinders was taken out of the hospital premises.” The hospital, the biggest Covid-19 facility in the town, has 335 beds for Covid-19 patients. Of these, 300 have oxygen pipe connections or oxygen cylinders. Besides, the institute has a 5,000-litre liquid oxygen storage tanker, and will add another 6,000-litre tanker by Tuesday. On a normal day, the hospital would need about 150 oxygen cylinders and 2.5 metric tonnes of piped oxygen. Now, the average daily requirement has gone up to 400 oxygen cylinders and 7-8 metric tonnes of piped oxygen. “We have enough oxygen,” Kumar said. Families, however, said the situation at other hospitals across the country had worried them. At least 20 Covid-19 patients at a hospital in Delhi died on Friday night after oxygen pressure went low. Earlier this week, on Wednesday, a private hospital in Meerut ran out of oxygen, after which 11 Covid-19 patients had to be moved to other hospitals. “Every other day, we hear news of oxygen supply running out and causing mass deaths. That was why we took away cylinders for our patients, to be used only if the regular supply were interrupted … We did not steal the cylinders,” a relative of a patient at LLRM said. “We cannot trust the hospital authorities. It’s a matter of life and death.” Kumar said that while there was enough oxygen, a problem of overuse had cropped up. “Families should trust doctors when they recommend medical oxygen for a patient, and when they don’t. Panic has made oxygen seem indispensable,” he added. “During rounds, I often see patients taking oxygen through the piped supply even when they don’t need it. It requires a lot of convincing to wean them off. We had to get the external oxygen supply removed from many beds after patients who did not need oxygen started using it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/patients-families-loot-oxygen-consignment-at-meerut-hospital/articleshow/82234936.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Kolkata||KMC, West Bengal help for Covid death certificate, hearse||KOLKATA: The spike in Covid cases and the high rate of deaths—many of them occurring at home, before the patients can be taken to hospital— have led the Kolkata Municipal Corporation as well as the state government to start streamlining the cremation process. From now, Covid patients undergoing treatment at home will be strictly monitored. In case bereaved families fail to get a doctor to issue death certificates for patients dying at home, they can call up a special civic helpline to contact a KMC medical officer at the nearest borough office who will help with a certificate, without which cremation will not be possible. At the chief secretary’s meeting with the health secretary and KMC on Saturday, it was also decided that cremation of people dying of Covid would be carried out free of cost and with dignity. Many families had complained about fleecing during cremation, which officials said, was being examined and that the guilty would be punished. Also, the rate of private hospital hearse was fixed at Rs 3,000, an official said. While a civic health official conceded that many families were being forced to wait for long hours—some waited for seven hours and one even 16—he also pointed out that the civic body was under pressure, sending their limited number of hearses to different corners of the city to take Covid victims to crematoriums. After the meeting, the KMC has also decided that after arranging for a death certificate for a deceased at home, the civic body will also send a hearse to take the body to a Covid-designate crematorium. The family would be given an option to choose among crematoriums, depending on the location of their residence, said a senior KMC official. If the KMC failed to arrange a hearse in time and the family wanted to go for a private hearse, the civic body could intervene in case the private operator demanded exorbitant rates. All that the family in distress needed to do was the KMC Covid helplines to get the services, said a KMC official. The steps were taken after the authorities were flooded with reports of distressed families. A senior professor of statistics at Calcutta University, who had been suffering from Covid 19 since last Wednesday, died around 5am on Saturday at his home.

---||Delhi||BJP attacks Delhi govt over oxygen plants||New Delhi: Claiming that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s “ineptitude” on oxygen issue was exposed in Delhi High Court, BJP on Saturday said it became evident that Delhi government was sleeping at the wheel. The party also circulated a central government letter dated April 7 to states that they should set up O2 production plants to tackle the imminent crisis. “How many state governments acted on the letter? When did Arvind Kejriwal come to know that his state doesn’t have O2 production plants? What did his government do to get its own plant? Why are premier hospitals not asked to set up their own plants?” questioned BJP general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh. A Delhi government source, however, said that eight pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen generation plants were being installed in Delhi with the support of PM Cares Fund. One plant at a Burari hospital has been installed and other four are expected to be installed by April 30. Site readiness certificate for one site has been received on April 19 and the remaining are still awaited. The eight plants will enhance the availability of oxygen. “For the PSA oxygen plants, Delhi government was to provide land and it did. These were supposed to be constructed by the central government. However, the Centre’s contractor made only one and ran away. We have written several letters in the last few months to the Centre to expedite this,” a health department source said. BJP chief spokesperson Anil Baluni said the Delhi CM seems to have a simple strategy: Do nothing, allow things to get worse, Centre steps in and saves the day. “Then, Kejriwal makes ads to claim credit. In all this, the losers are the people of Delhi who are suffering due to lack of oxygen, while Mr Kejriwal is happy playing politics,” Baluni alleged. Baluni said during the first wave of Covid, Kejriwal simply put his hands up and called for the Centre’s help. “Home minister Amit Shah had to step in and bring the situation under control. This time, too, Mr Kejriwal is doing the same thing,” the BJP functionary said. The BJP said last year, Kejriwal was in the news for promising home delivery of oxygen for Covid patients. “Today, his AAP government has been chided by the high court on the same issue of oxygen supply,” the party functionary said. Leader of Opposition in the Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri accused Delhi government of misleading people to hide its own failure to set up PSA oxygen plants sanctioned by the central government months ago. The government has also not been able to arrange tankers to lift its required quota of oxygen, Bidhuri said in a statement. Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said it was highly regrettable that the AAP government overlooked the importance of setting up oxygen plants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-attacks-delhi-govt-over-oxygen-plants/articleshow/82236120.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Even those in isolation are urging them to take their pets to creches until they recover. The Help Suffering Lives Society, an NGO working for rescue and rehabilitation animals, are receiving a lot of calls from pet owners requesting help. “A pet owner, who has spent Rs 50,000 on the treatment of his pet in the last six months, is asking for my help for its adoption by a family. Since the pandemic has reduced incomes, the family had removed the helper and is now not in a position to afford the pet,” said Sanjiv Sankhla, who is finding it hard to provide him with the solution. Distress calls are making the activists stunned and shocked. “A caller requested to take care of their pet in case they contracted the infection and died. They wanted to make an agreement which shows their love for pets but I refused them politely for not having any such facility other than delivering medicines and food for their pet,” said Sankhla. Those in isolation due to Covid are making requests to animal rights activists for keeping their pets till they recover. Rohit Gangwal of Raksha NGO received a call from a couple in Ajmer who contracted the infection a couple of days ago. “They asked us to look after their dog till their report came negative. They have not able to find a foster house among their friends and family. Such help cannot be fulfilled since every pet is different in terms of food habits, daily routine and behaviour,” said Gangwal. Taking advantage of the situation, pet sellers have to come to the rescue by providing paid service. They charge as per the breed of the pet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/animal-rights-activists-get-disterss-calls-from-pet-lovers/articleshow/82235530.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: CBI should probe Anil Parab, women’s panel Sanjay Raut, says BJP||MUMBAI: BJP state unit president Chandrakant Patil has demanded a CBI inquiry against transport minister Anil Parab. Patil further demanded that the National Commission for Women inquire into the allegations against Sena MP and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut by a woman.  The woman, in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had alleged harassment by Raut for eight years. The demands come in light of the CBI filing an FIR against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh. The former home minister was accused by former Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh of setting monthly collection targets of Rs 100 crore from bars for various Mumbai police officials, including assistant police inspector Sachin Waze. Waze, who was arrested in the Mansukh Hiran murder case, had said in a letter to the special NIA court that Parab had asked him to extort money from 50 BMC contractors. Waze is also an accused in the case related to placing of an explosives-laden SUV near the residence of businessman Mukesh Ambani in South Mumbai. “Though Parab issued a clarification, the truth will be known only when the CBI inquires into it. In his letter, Waze had referred to one Ghodawat. The CBI must also institute an inquiry against Ghodawat,” he said speaking to mediapersons in Pune. Rejecting labour minister and NCP leader Hasan Mushrif’s allegation the CBI inquiry and FIR against Deshmukh was a BJP conspiracy, Patil said it was Singh who had approached Supreme Court but was directed to the high court saying the issue was serious. “It is the HC that ordered a CBI inquiry and the plea filed by Deshmukh and the state government against the order was rejected by the apex court. What has all of this got to do with the BJP?” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cbi-should-probe-parab-womens-panel-raut-says-bjp/articleshow/82237219.cms||---
---||Jodhpur||Union cabinet minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat proposes 500-bed temporary hospital in Jodhpur||JODHPUR: Union cabinet minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat has proposed to set up a 500-bed temporary hospital in Jodhpur. The hospital is proposed to be set up at MBM Engineering College of the city, for which the minister will be roping in his own team. A day after granting an aid of Rs 50 lakh from MP-Lad funds to deal with the ongoing crisis, Shekhawat has come up with this new proposal in view of the dire shortage of beds in the city. "I had a talk with the district magistrate on Saturday for this temporary hospital for Covid patients," he said adding that his team would be working on it very soon. "Our objective is to start with 100 beds which will be set up in 3-4 days and then add 100 beds per day upto 500 beds," said Shekhawat. He said that this was the crisis time and it was not possible for the administration to arrange all the facilities in short time given the resource limitations. "So we have decided to achieve this task with public support and help of our workers and teams," he said. He has, however, asked the district administration and medical officers to arrange a senior doctor and some senior and junior resident doctors for 24-hour monitoring besides medicines and oxygen once the beds are set up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/shekhawat-proposes-500-bed-temporary-hosp-in-jodhpur/articleshow/82235559.cms||---
---||Jodhpur||Covid-19: Jodhpur district records over 50 deaths in 4 days||JODHPUR: Jodhpur continues to record highest Covid mortality in the state. Though the positive cases per day crossed the mark of 2,000 on Saturday, the city has recorded an alarming over 50 casualties in the past four days. Although, relatives and attendants of some patients have been attributing this troubling morality figure to lack of adequate care and timely attention by the medical staff, the administrative officials and the doctors, however, have cited late arrival of the patients to the hospitals and delayed admission in some cases due to shortage of beds in the hospitals. DM Indrajit Singh said that 20% admissions in the hospitals are those who have already reached a critical stage and have a bleak chance of revival. “Those tested positive should seriously adhere to the treatment protocol and approach the CHCs and district hospitals. But mostly people do not show seriousness while taking primary treatment and when the condition worsens, they directly come to Jodhpur from periphery areas,” said Singh. However, according to Ranjit Sinha, who lost his brother to Covid at MDM Hospital on Saturday said that doctors and nursing staff have been treating the patients in a casual manner and resorting to panic response on condition of the patient turning critical. But the principal of SN Medical College S S Rathore also shared the same views as Singh about the growing mortality in Jodhpur. “Most of the patients, who are coming for admission come when things have almost gone out of control and the infection would have affected a major part of their lungs,” said Rathore. The other reason attributed to this situation is the alleged referral of patients from private hospitals. Many cases have been reported when the private hospitals have referred the Covid patients to government hospitals after their condition turns unmanageable. In order to keep the hospital beds secured for patients in critical stage, the district administration and medical college administration has decided to work out a mechanism. Singh said that many such patients are being given beds in the hospitals, who could easily be home-quarantined and did not require beds. “Now we have decided that not everyone coming to the hospital with mild or moderate medical condition or having clout will be provided with beds. The beds would now be reserved for critical patients, so that the entire focus of the medical teams could be on such patients,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/over-50-deaths-in-jodhpur-in-4-days-docs-blame-late-admissions/articleshow/82235562.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: MPT facility to be Covid hospital, but has no ICU||PANAJI/VASCO: The state government on Saturday declared MPT hospital, which served as a Covid care centre during the first phase of the pandemic, as Covid hospital. It will be the third Covid hospital in South Goa. The hospital has a capacity for over 200 beds but it doesn’t have a dedicated ICU, which is critical to treat moderate to serious patients. Though it has regular staff, a health official said, the hospital does not have a full-time pulmonologist. It was suggested to health secretary Ravi Dhawan at a meeting he had with doctors, that it be made as an intermediate centre — a step-up or step-down centre — and help reduce the burden on South Goa district hospital (SGDH) and Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital, Bambolim. “Patients, where it is suspected that their case may worsen because of their comorbidities, can be admitted to the MPT hospital and, if need be, transferred to either GMC or SGDH,” the health official said. Currently, even mild cases get admitted to GMC or SGDH for lack of beds. A week ago, South Goa collector had notified MPT hospital as Covid care centre, but within a few hours, the order was withdrawn without giving any justification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mpt-facility-to-be-covid-hospital-but-has-no-icu/articleshow/82236150.cms||---
---||Jaipur||IAF aircraft transports empty oxygen tankers from Jodhpur station for refilling in Jamnagar||JAIPUR: The Indian Air Force airlifted two empty cryogenic oxygen containers from Jodhpur to Jamnagar by C17 heavy lift transporters on Saturday morning. The defence forces have come into play after majority of the states, including Rajasthan, flagged acute shortage of oxygen for Covid patients. The filled tankers will return through other means of transportation and IAF is only picking up empty containers. “The IAF aircraft airlifted the two empty containers to Jamnagar though the filled tankers will not be flown back. The reason for this is that liquid oxygen is not feasible for transportation through air. They will be brought either via road or by railways,” said an official. While more such sorties might be undertaken in the subsequent days, officials at present did not confirm the same. IAF has started transporting empty tankers after delivery of oxygen to destination state/UT to oxygen-producing locations to reduce movement time. With a view to make available additional tankers for movement of oxygen, MHA is coordinating lifting of high-capacity tankers from countries like Singapore and UAE by IAF transport planes. Further, the railway ministry is running special trains carrying oxygen tankers across the country for faster movement. Jodhpur railway division recently made a vacant corridor for oxygen special train from Phalodi in Rajasthan to Bhildri in Gujarat which was going for collection of oxygen, said officials. Rajasthan’s transport department also facilitated the movement of tankers carrying oxygen not only within the state, but also those crossing through for other states across the country. Police protection and flying squads are also being provided to these tankers to prevent any untoward incidents. The transport department is attempting to get a permit for nitrogen tankers as well which can transport liquid oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/iaf-aircraft-airlifts-empty-containers-from-jodhpur-for-refilling-in-jamnagar/articleshow/82235548.cms||---
---||Goa||Focus on hotspots, isolate false negative cases: Rohan Khaunte||PANAJI: Urging the state government to adopt a preventive approach to reduce the number of Covid-19 cases, Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte has asked the state government to create a protocol for symptomatic patients who test negative. Khaunte said that aside from awareness about false negative cases, the state government also needs to create necessary infrastructure to isolate and treat such symptomatic patients. The legislator has also asked the state government to ensure that medical teams are deployed at high-infection areas like Margao, Porvorim, and Candolim to micro-manage the pandemic in these areas and increase the treatment facilities in these constituencies. “These high-infection areas require additional focus and resources as compared to areas with low-infection spread,” said the Porvorim MLA. “Symptomatic patients with negative test results should also be immediately isolated, and if required, necessary infrastructure should be created to treat them in isolation. This should be done on a war-footing, considering that there is an increase in the trend of such symptomatic patients testing negative, which may be a direct outcome of the novel double mutant virus or the new strain,” he added. Khaunte has submitted these suggestions to the state government where he has urged the government to focus on tracing, testing and isolation. If required, the state should seek assistance from the Army Medical Corps to support Goa’s medical staff. “Increase testing through mobile vans for every constituency to spread awareness and prioritise the tracing, testing and isolation formula,” said Khaunte. The former revenue minister has also demanded that restrictions on entry at the state’s borders need to be imposed to avoid stronger variants of the novel coronavirus from infecting Goa. “The night curfew introduced by the state government needs to be implemented with no exceptions granted to bars, restaurants, casinos and other nightlife activities,” Khaunte said. The Porvorim MLA has also recommended the state government that a weekend lockdown must be imposed in the state to break the chain of infection. Aside from this, Khaunte has also asked the government to ensure adequate supply of testing kits, critical medicines, ventilators, oxygen and vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/focus-on-hotspots-isolate-false-negative-cases-khaunte/articleshow/82236173.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Wrap up wedding parties & feasts in 3 hours, rituals can go on: Home department||JAIPUR: If you are planning to get your kin married and are worried with the guidelines of the home department stating that you need to wrap up the wedding in three hours, here is good news for you. The home department on Saturday claimed that the three-hour restriction is meant for guests who attend a marriage for feast, dancing and giving their blessings and wishes to the bride and bridegroom. The bridegroom and bride’s family while following the guidelines can complete their rituals related to the weddings with the priest as per muhurat (auspicious time) that suits them. There is no need of winding up the wedding within three hours. From April 25 to the month of June, there are going to be more than 35 auspicious days for Hindu weddings. Friday’s order of the home department that marriages will have to be wrapped up in three hours has made families and priests associated with the wedding a little jittery and scared. “There are several things, including receiving of baraat, its procession, varmala, photo shoot, phere, chaak bhaat and feast. Also, the rituals related to the send-off of the bride to their in-laws home. How can all these be wrapped up in three hours,” said Sanwar Lal Sharma, a native of Jhotwara whose daugther is to get married on April 28. Various priests associated with the wedding opined that for wedding rituals it takes at least six to eight hours. “Even the phere takes one hour. This is a faulty decision by the home department,” said Shankar Lal Sharma, a priest. Likewise, Shiprali Bhatt, a native of Mansarover, said, “I had booked a beautician and I am supposed to get ready by 7pm. There is utter confusion.” Shiprali is getting married on April 26. Meanwhile, when contacted, Abhay Kumar, principal secretary (home), said, “The order of completing the things in three hours is only for the guests who will attend the wedding for blessing the couple. Others, including bride, bridegroom, their close family members and priests while following the norms can perform the rituals as per the auspicious time. Guests are supposed to vacate the venue within three hours after their arrival.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/wrapping-up-wedding-in-3-hours-meant-for-guests-rituals-can-go-on/articleshow/82235567.cms||Ashish Mehta
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Surat startup tackles water scarcity woes through desal tech||AHMEDABAD: State and central governments in India have proposed hundreds of crores of budget outlay to set up desalination plants for addressing acute water scarcity woes. To make not just usable but potable water available to millions of Indians, Surat-based startup, Solnce Green Energy, has developed a device for solar-thermal desalination that helps convert seawater into drinkable water. The technology has not just received certification from the National Accreditation Board for testing and calibration Laboratories (NABL) but has also won accolades at national and global levels. A winner of UNDP’s Innovations for Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) in 2020 and a finalist in Niti Aayog’s Youth Collab, the startup is implementing its pilot project in Olpad region of Surat. Solnce Green Energy was also a second runner-up in a startup competition organized this year by Innopreneurs, which is a platform for startups. “We have set up the device through which we are able to generate 1,500 litre potable water every day over seven hours of operations. At present, we’re supplying the water in village only for regular use and not for potable purposes, as we’re still working on achieving optimum quality,” said Yash Tarwadi, founder, Solnce Green Energy LLP, who began working on the project since he graduated as a chemical engineer in 2018. The water generated from the device is pure mineralised water and can be used for drinking as well as for distilled water manufacturing, pharmaceutical and other industries. A postgraduate diploma holder from Indian Institute of Management, Kolkata, Tarwadi has also received grants worth at least Rs 10 lakh from the state government to execute the project. “The technology is yet to be formally commissioned anywhere. We are in the process of optimizing our output. We have also applied for a patent for our desalination technology and are expecting approvals soon. Meanwhile, we are also in talks with the state government agencies for installing and commissioning the project in two districts of Gujarat to address the water scarcity problem,” Tarwadi further added. Going forward, the startup plans to scale up to be able to generate more water in less time and help effectively address the water scarcity issue. “Initial-level talks are on with investors from Mumbai and Pune to further help scale up the project. We’re looking to raise Rs 1 crore to be able to launch and expand,” he further explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/surat-startup-tackles-water-scarcity-woes-through-desal-tech/articleshow/82237233.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan government to distribute Remdesivir to private hospitals on requirement||JAIPUR: In view of shortage of Remdesivir injections in the state and only three companies supplying the medicine to the state on Saturday, the state government has issued an order stating that it will make available the medicine from its stock to those private hospitals that require it immediately for the treatment of Covid patients. Rajasthan Medical Services Corporation Limited (RMSCL) –which runs the CM free medicine scheme- will provide Remdesivir injections to private hospitals on payment of Rs 2,340.80 per injection (basic rate Rs1900+12%GST+10% RMSC surcharge). The order, issued by health secretary Siddharth Mahajan, stated that every district collector will set up a three-member committee in each district and after the consultation with district’s medical college principal/CMHO/chief medical officer the decision to distribute Remdesivir and Tocilizumab will be taken considering its requirement, utility and availability. “We have received Remdesivir from three companies – Hetero, Sun pharmaceuticals and Jubilant - on Saturday. Immediately after receiving, the medicines have been allocated to the private hospitals that needed it. There isn’t sufficient stock in the state but after Saturday’s supply, it will be enough for the next two days,” said an official, who is a member of the committee formed for management of the supply of medicines in the state. “On Monday, we are hopeful of receiving medicines from other companies as well.” There are seven companies that supply remdesivir injections to Rajasthan including Cadila, Dr. Reddy’s, Cipla, Hetero, Jubilant, Mylan and Sun Pharmaceuticals. “On Friday, there was no supply of remdesivir injections to the state by any of the manufacturing companies. There was an extreme shortage of remdesivir injection in Rajasthan on Friday,” the official said. Jaipur district collector Antar Singh Nehra on Saturday constituted a three-member committee to make Remedisvir and Tocilizumab medicines available to private hospitals for treatment of Covid 19 on the basis of need, utility and availability. The members of the committee are Dr. Narottam Sharma (CMHO-I), senior professor of SMS Dr. Raman Sharma and professor Dr. Abhishek Agarwal. Nehra informed that on behalf of district administration, additional district magistrate Ashok Kumar has been appointed as nodal officer for distribution and supervision of these medicines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-to-distribute-remdesivir-to-private-hospitals-on-requirement/articleshow/82235564.cms||---

Yet, we could not get an air ambulance without a wait of about three days,’’ said Brijesh Agrawal, who flew his Covidpositive and diabetic 83-year old grandfather from Agra to Indore this week for Rs 9 lakh. “He was in Mathura, but because Indore has better medical facilities, and our family is here too, we booked the charter,’’ he added. Others who booked charter flights for Covid patients in the past two days were charged triple the cost. A charter operator said, “A patient was charged Rs 24 lakh to fly from Indore to Chennai.” The fee charged by the doctor onboard has also gone up. “Earlier doctors charged Rs 35,000-Rs 45,000 per trip on a regular air ambulance. Now it has gone up to Rs 2-3 lakh for a Covid air ambulance charter flight,’’ said a source. Rahul Muchhal of Accretion Aviation, an aggregator, said, “We have been turning down bookings as there are no planes. The customer waits 2-3 days after booking to board a plane, but we ensure bed-to-bed transfer.” “We have had reverse movement of people moving from metros where beds and oxygen supply are in shortage to smaller cities,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/3-day-wait-for-charter-flights-for-covid-patients-cost-triples/articleshow/82237251.cms||Manju V
---||Nagpur||Live feed of funerals through social media, other platforms new pandemic trend||Nagpur: As Reena Ravikumar started a Facebook live feed for her aunt’s funeral, friends and relatives joined in from across the country and world to pay tributes as another precious life was swept away in the relentless Covid-19 pandemic. Restrictions on the number of people who can attend funeral plus the fear of contracting the virus is keeping many people away from physically joining in the last rites of the loved ones. But thanks to social media and online meeting platforms, hundreds of people are able to ‘virtually’ join the last journey of the Covid victims. Ravikumar said relatives residing abroad were unable to reach at a short notice. “Also, since only five people are allowed to attend a Covid funeral (non-Covid is 20), I thought of doing a live feed through social media for the funeral. There were so many comments and people expressed their gratitude for being able to witness the final rites, even though they were far away,” she said. According to Dr Shabhahat Yar Khan, this is one of the few “positive things in which the social media is being used”. “Recently, my wife’s relative passed away. You always long to see the loved one for one last time. Through social media, she was able to witness that and it gave her some solace,” he said. The new trend of online webcast of funerals is helping family members connect. “In their time of grief, what any family needs is moral support. In normal times, we would visit the family home and later accompany them to the graveyard. But, with strict restrictions on number of attendees, only immediate family members go there. I have attended a few of these online webcasts and I felt good about it,” said Nelson Francis. Shireen B, who is now settled in Hyderabad, recently attended a funeral of a relative who passed away in Nagpur. “It takes time for the shock to wear off because you don’t realize that Covid-19 can hit so close to home. The family had arranged for an online webcast but due to technical issues I could see only a small part of it. Still, I had the satisfaction of ‘being there’ during their tough time,” she said. Some like Annirudha Mande has not only attended four such funerals since March, he has also arranged for one. “Visiting ghats during Covid-19 times is next to impossible because we have senior citizens and children at home. My uncle passed away recently and only four of us went to Ambazhari ghat. I started a video feed and also took photos which were then put up on my family WhatsApp group. This gesture was appreciated by everyone who thanked me for taking the effort and helping them all to be part of my uncle’s final journey,” he said. Sociologist BK Swain says this online funeral trend will come to an end ultimately. “It’s a passing phase brought about by compulsion. In a year, we will be back to the original scenario because, in any society, last rites have an emotional connection. People also go to mark their ‘attendance’ as not being there can be considered rude especially as the bereaved family members are going through a tough time. Once the pandemic subdues, people will flock to attend funerals due to emotional reasons or peer and societal pressure,” said Swain, a doctorate in sociology and author who recently retired as Nagpur University’s sociology head of department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/live-feed-of-funerals-through-social-media-other-platforms-new-pandemic-trend/articleshow/82235574.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Delhi||Delhi: They were fine last evening, it’s a murder by authorities, allege kin||NEW DELHI: The families of the 20 people who lost their lives due to low oxygen pressure at Jaipur Golden Hospital on Saturday described it as murder at the hands of the hospital and the authorities. The kin of the deceased told TOI that they were fine until last evening and the hospital hadn’t alerted them to any crisis. Jasbir Singh, who lost his brother-in-law in the tragedy, said, “I spoke to him on Friday evening and he was totally fine. Then we received a call around midnight and were informed that he had passed away. When we reached the hospital, we learnt the death was due to an oxygen crisis.” Local residents and relatives had gathered outside the hospital, demanding action to be taken against it. Police and paramilitary personnel have been deployed to prevent any misadventure. Singh’s brother-in-law, Dinesh Kataria, was admitted to the hospital five days ago, feverish and in need of oxygen support. “He was only 41 years old and has left behind two children aged eight and five. Who will take care of them? We don’t have the words to describe the catastrophe that has struck us,” said Singh. Hari Singh Tomar had a similar story. He said his sister-in-law, Manju Tomar, 32, was fine when the family last spoke to her on a video call. Manju was in the ICU after admission on April 18 for Covid-related fever and cold. “We paid some hospital dues around 9.55pm and some time later, she was no more,” said Hari Singh. “No one told us about a crisis or her condition was declining. The hospital, the central government and Delhi government are all responsible for her death.” He added, “The doctors at the hospital charged us so much and told us her condition was improving. We had arranged plasma for her too. We heard rumours of the oxygen mishap and later, we were shocked to discover Manju was one of those who had died. She has left behind three children aged 10, eight and five years.” Hari Singh claimed that the hospital put Manju’s body into an ambulance and directed the family to reach the cremation ground. “After repeated requests, they showed us her face. Once the post-cremation rituals are completed, we will lodge a police complaint,” he said. Most of the other families too got custody of the bodies only at the cremation ground. Soon after news spread, the families of those who had lost their lives gathered outside the hospital. The DCP, Special Branch, instructed senior area, traffic and police control room officers to make adequate arrangements to prevent any breakdown in law and order. The DCP’s alert said, “Information has been received that the oxygen in the Jaipur Golden hospital has been exhausted.

---||Pune||Step out without reason, face Covid test: Pune rural cops||PUNE: The district rural police have adopted a new strategy to prevent people from stepping out of their homes without valid reason — subjecting them to rapid antigen tests. The rural police on Friday made over 125 people undergo the test with the help of Baramati tehsil administration and found 12 people Covid positive. Superintendent of police Abhinav Deshmukh told TOI on Saturday, “We have decided to implement this strategy across all 13 tehsils as a measure to contain the spread of the virus. We have already told all tehsil administrations to provide us a medical team, which will work in tandem with the police in carrying out testing of violators at check points in towns and villages where the cases are high.” Those found positive during Friday’s drive were asymptomatic and they didn’t have any health issues. They were in contact with Covid positive patients. “We have admitted them at the Covid care centres (CCCs) where they will stay for the next two days,” Deshmukh added. Baramati tehsil and town are the worst affected by the virus in rural Pune. It has reported 3,451 cases -- the highest in the district. There are 529 containment zones in the tehsil, said zilla parishad officials. Rural Pune has over 25,000 Covid positive cases till date and 2,642 patients have succumbed to the virus since the outbreak of the pandemic. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, ZP, said, “We have directed gram panchayat staffers and panchayat samiti employees to work in tandem with police and participate in their activities..”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/step-out-without-reason-face-covid-test-rural-cops/articleshow/82235575.cms||Sandip Dighe

---||Jaipur||Oxygen crisis: Many small private hospitals in Jaipur turning away patients||JAIPUR: Some of the small private hospitals in the city have stopped admitting patients any more due to limited supply of oxygen. Meanwhile, New Medical College in Kota issued an order asking the doctors not to admit any Covid-19 patient without the permission of superintendent. The number of patients are continuously increasing and there is no adequate supply of oxygen cylinders. Though some private hospitals have decided to treat Covid-19 patients, but they alleged that they are not getting oxygen supply. The crises deepened in small hospitals which have less than 50-bed capacity. “I have 26 patients admitted to the hospital. I required 60 cylinders of oxygen, but I have got only 25 cylinders per day. There is always an apprehension. If we get oxygen supply late, it will put life of the patients at risk,” said an owner of a private hospital. Another hospital, with 25-bed capacity, said that they have stopped admitting Covid-19 patients. “If we see that the oxygen saturation of the patients is low and he requires oxygen for treatment, we do not have any option except saying no to them. We do not have proper oxygen supply, which is why, I have shifted patients to other hospitals,” said another private hospital, near SMS Hospital. Since the Covid-19 patients are increasing in numbers, some private hospitals who are treating patients of different specialties are willing to treat Covid-19 patients. “We had demanded oxygen cylinders fora week to start a Covid ward in our hospital, but we have not been provided with the oxygen. Because we do not have oxygen cylinders, we cannot admit any Covid-19 patient,” said the official of the hospital. In Jaipur, 76 private hospitals are now providing Covid-19 treatment to the patients, having 5,046 beds reserved for the Covid-19 patients. Out of those, 3,615 beds are occupied.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/many-small-pvt-hosps-in-city-face-acute-shortage-of-oxygen/articleshow/82235569.cms||---

We had requested the doctor to provide a substitute as this medicine is not available anywhere in the country. But he did not listen and insisted on it. She died waiting for it,” said local resident Vansh Khanduja, whose relative was admitted to a private hospital in Panchkula. He said, “We were willing to give a written consent for the substitute drug.” A man, who has been desperately searching for Remdesivir for his ailing father in a private hospital, said, “I need three more vials. We could arrange three previously with struggle. I am not even sure, if the drug is original. But I have no choice.” Some patients in PGI have also been asked to procure Tocilizumab drug from outside the hospital. PGI director Prof Jagat Ram said, “Looking at the projections, the numbers will keep on rising until mid of May. In this second wave, there is a sudden drop in oxygen saturation levels.” Bigger private hospitals in the Tricity are not facing oxygen cylinder shortage at the moment. In government hospitals, PGI has four liquid oxygen storage vehicles of 44 kilo litre capacity. Every day, the hospital is consuming 12,600 cubic metre oxygen. There are close to 800 cylinders of different capacities and the institute is going to add 20 kilo litre more and has started the process of approval. GMCH has oxygen tanks full of 8.5 tonnes of oxygen and sector 48 hospital has 2.3 tonnes of oxygen in the hospital. Besides these, there are three Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) Oxygen generation plant. These plants do not require any replenishment of liquid oxygen or cylinders as the oxygen gas will be generated from air.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/positivity-rate-19-shortage-of-antiviral-drugs-in-city/articleshow/82234974.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Ayush Prasad, CEO of the Zilla Parishad (ZP), on Saturday issued a circular to this effect to all the 1,400 gram panchayats in the district. He said, “The gram panchayat staffers played a crucial role in mitigating the Covid situation last year. We need them to put in similar efforts this time as well.” He said last year, they had only given monetary incentives to Asha workers. “This time, we have included all gram panchayat and anganwadi workers too. The performance criteria have already been fixed, based on which we shall reward them every fortnight at the tehsil-level,” he said.If the gram panchayat staffers manage to bring down positive cases by 80%, with no deaths in 15 days, each of them would get Rs2,000 as a reward. Similarly, if their efforts reduce Covid positivity rate by 60-80%, the ZP would award Rs1,500 to each staffer involved in the programme. “According to the norms, we can’t give monetary incentives to government employees.

While the hills were the worst affected, farmers in Dehradun, Nainital, Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar also complained of massive losses. Speaking to TOI, Ajit Rai, a farmer from Dehradun’s Sahaspur area, said, “The state hardly recorded any rainfall in the last winter season. So, we were forced to arrange for different water sources to sow crops. Now, when the crops were ready for the harvest, rain and hail damaged them.” In a similar vein, Ankit Pawar, a farmer from Haridwar’s Roorkee, said, “The rain spell has damaged standing crops. If precipitation continues in the region, we will be staring at huge losses.” Owners of fruit orchards also suffered a loss due to the recent rain spell. “Several peach and plum trees were uprooted completely. Many other trees also suffered significant damage due to the rainfall and won’t be able to bear fruits this season,” said Naresh Galiya, a farmer from Nainital’s Ramgarh area. The officials of the horticulture department have said that they are assessing the loss. “Several areas received heavy rainfall. The most affected areas were Dehradun’s Jaunsar-Bawar, Nainital and the other upper reaches. We are assessing the damage and a comprehensive report will soon be prepared,” said an official. Meanwhile, vehicular movements remained disrupted at the Gangotri national highway due to incessant rain and snowfall in Uttarkashi district on Friday. The power supply was also affected in several villages. According to sources, the Gangotri highway remained blocked ahead of the Sukki Top region as a consequence of landslides and a thick blanket of snow. More than half a dozen villages got cut off from the district headquarter due to the landslide. The district administration started the restoration work soon after the weather cleared on Saturday. Devendra Patwal, district disaster management officer, said, “The Border Road Organization (BRO) restored traffic movements in a few hours after the weather cleared. The electricity department is also undertaking repair work and the power supply will be restored till late (Saturday) evening.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/unseasonal-rain-hail-damage-crops-across-uttarakhand/articleshow/82234979.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Pune||Pune: Corona centre with ICU beds to come up in Baner||PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is starting a Covid-19 hospital in Baner. The facility will have oxygen plants and provision of liquid oxygen tank. There will be 212 beds at the hospital. Of the total, 150 will be oxygen-supported beds while the remaining 62 beds will be in the intensive care unit (ICU). Four small oxygen plants of 1,000 litre, per minute, capacity will be started in addition to a liquid oxygen tank. The hospital is expected to start by next month. This is the second dedicated Covid-19 treatment facility coming up in Baner. The first facility was commissioned by the civic body last year in August. It is currently running at full capacity with over 330 beds. The Baner facility was the first hospital which was restarted at full capacity during the recent spike in Covid-19 cases. Mayor Muralidhar Mohol said that efforts are on to increase bed capacity and oxygen supply to meet the increasing demand. “The commissioning of new facility in Baner is part of the efforts being taken since the last month. We have already decided to allocate Rs 5 crore for the new facility besides using corporate social responsibility contributions. Steps are being taken to start the facility at the earliest. The infrastructural work has been expedited,” he said. Mohol added that setting up of oxygen plants and liquid oxygen tank will help meet the oxygen demand. The civic body is also in the process of commissioning oxygen plants at two other PMC-run hospitals, he said. Balewadi health hub should function at full capacity: Sena leadersLeaders from Shiv Sena recently appealed to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to augment Covid-19 facilities in the city, including the facility at Balewadi.

---||Nagpur||O2 plant breaks down, hits supply; Remdesivir & Toci yet to arrive||Nagpur: Private hospitals and home-isolated patients once again had a tough time from early Saturday morning until late in the afternoon as oxygen production and refilling came to a halt at the MIDC-based Jubilee Plant from where the city is getting over 1,000 jumbo cylinders. The operation was restored by the afternoon while the district received around 169 metric tonnes of supply from different sources which helped tide over the day’s crisis. Three cryogenic tankers from Oxygen Express, one 38 metric tonne tanker from Rourkela and another 30 metric tonne tanker from steel plants were among the supply the district received. The district’s requirement was 185 metric tonne while all sources ramped up the O2 availability to 169 metric tonnes. Officials said though there was a shortfall of 16metric tonnes, not many complaints were received from private hospitals which somehow managed patients. Some hospitals said complaints were less as people have resigned to the fact that the shortage of resources may continue despite best efforts as the demand is too high. They said the Jubilee Plant would function the entire Saturday night to ensure hospitals have enough stock for Sunday. “Jubilee’s load was staggered to three different agencies during its breakdown,” they said. Amid the fresh crisis, hospitals and home-isolated patients had to fall back on redistribution of the cylinders with only emergency cases getting the refill. On the other hand, the wait for high-value Tocilizumab injections prolonged as the drug didn’t arrive on Saturday. Officials said it will not come to the city before April 31. Alzumab, a substitute injection, too, is likely to arrive by the first week of May, said officials. The district received 1,681 vials of Remdesivir which was being sold for Rs28,000 per vial in the black market. Sources said though the guidelines clearly state that the Remdesivir injection is to be given to only moderate to severe patients, several mild cases were being given the scarce drug. “Remdesivir is being arranged for patients who are ready to pay anything. Similarly, Tocilizumab is being sold by black marketers to those who have the paying capacity while deserving patients are not getting it,” sources said. Vidarbha Hospitals’ Association (VHA) convener Dr Anup Marar said the oxygen crisis is due to the mismatch of demand and supply. “The incessant increase of beds, ventilators, HFNOs and Bipaps visavis limited supply and cylinders have landed everybody in jeopardy. Beds, especially ventilator beds, should have been increased only when sufficient supply and cylinders were matchingly enhanced. Moreover, substitutes of Tocilizumab should be provided. Home-based Remdesivir treatment of Group A, B and C patients should be strictly stopped so that only the genuinely needy ones get them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/o2-plant-breaks-down-hits-supply-remdesivir-toci-yet-to-arrive/articleshow/82235605.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Pune||Importers of O2 equipment seek leeway in freight costs||Pune: Oxygen equipment importers and distributors on Saturday welcomed the Centre’s decision to waive off import duties on equipment like concentrators and cryogenic cylinders, but urged more leeway, especially in freight costs, for a substantial revision in end-user prices.Most of such equipment is imported from some European countries, as well as the US and China, with the prices for some of these items increasing twice or even more. The actual benefit due to the government’s Saturday decision, according to concentrator manufacturers and importers, is around 7.5% of the unit cost, plus other fees.Importers and distributors said that the relief offered would offer some relief to end-users, despite a relatively small sum in absolute terms.“This is definitely a step in the right direction. It is a small relief, but dealers must pass this onto the end-users,” said Prashant Korachagaon, the national sales manager of DeVilbiss, one of the largest manufacturers of oxygen concentrators in the world, which imports the machines from the US.Another manufacturer and importer, Medequip, which imports its machines manufactured at Shenyang in China, echoed views of DeVilbiss and said more relief was needed to bring down transportation costs.“Arrivals by sea have a waiting period of a month. So, we have to resort to air freight. Importing even one of these oxygen concentrators by air is increasing the price of one unit by Rs 8,000. Even then, we are trying to absorb half the cost of transportation. Yes, the dealers should pass on the benefit of the import duty cut to the customers, but the government should also think of some subsidy for air freight,” said Alok Garg, the managing director of Medequip.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/importers-of-o2-equipment-seek-leeway-in-freight-costs/articleshow/82235581.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

He also revealed the name of third accomplice to crime branch sleuths during the first day of interrogation after he was remanded to police custody on Friday till April 26. Police produced another accused Vishal Awasthi in court on Saturday and he was remanded to police custody till April 27. Patel further confessed that a person named Gaurang used to bring buyers of remdesivir to him. The case was transferred to the crime branch on Friday. Police informed that Awasthi runs a medical store in K P Sanghvi Hospital. He is in-charge of purchase and distribution of the medicines. He provided the six vials of Remdesivir to Patel. The injections had expired in 2020 but considering its high demand, Awasthi planned to make quick money by selling the expired stock. “Patel earlier worked as a deliveryman in his brother-in-law’s pharmaceutical distributor firm. He came in touch with Awasthi during that period,” said a crime branch officer. “It is not yet clear if the vials contain water,” said a police official. The vials will be sent to the forensic science laboratory for verification. After collecting the injections from Awasthi, Patel changed the expiry date on the carton containing the injection, but the original dates were mentioned on the vial. Patel sold six vials, charging Rs 7,000 for each, to Jignesh Malani. Later, Malani realized that the injections had already expired and he contacted Patel over the phone and demanded his money back. Patel agreed and returned the money through Google Pay.

---||Allahabad||Surge in no of ghant on Peepal trees an indication and witness to Covid destruction||Prayagraj: The second wave of Covid-19 pandemic has adversely affected the lives of the denizens of Sangam City. The increasing death toll has left families devastated and the magnitude of the pandemic could be gauged by a glimpse of the Peepal tree of every locality. The number of Ghant (the earthen pot hanged to the branches of the Peepal tree as per the Hindu tradition) tied on the Peepal tree is an indication and witness to the lives lost in the deadly pandemic. As per Hindu tradition, a Ghant is hanged at a Peepal tree and a ceremony is performed beneath the tree after the cremation of a family member. The situation is so grim that the trees, which usually had around 2-3 such Ghant in a week, is today supporting around a dozen such pots. Moreover, this is just the tip of the iceberg as most of the deaths are happening in families which are already infected by Covid and in such a situation, most of the families are not able to perform the rituals that are normally practised for peace of the departed soul after cremation. Likewise, the priests, who normally conducted around 2-3 ceremonies per week before the pandemic are today performing rituals for around 10 deaths. “I am working like a machine in an auto-mode, there is no time to gloom the death of my Jajmaan (clients) as there are many who are unable to perform the rituals and taken the pledge that they will be performing the same after a month or two, as per the traditions”, said Avdesh Mishra, a priest. He adds, “I feel so sad for the departed souls as it is believed that these ceremonies are essential for the peace of the departed, but here I and the city is witnessing so many deaths that most of the people are not able to perform the last rites”. Be it the famous Peepal tree of Sulem Sarai, that of Rajroopur, the one near Ashok Nagar or the trees at Bairana, the huge tree at Dara Ganj and Rasoolabad, all are witnessing the same heart-breaking scenes. “We are performing cremation for around 60-70 bodies every day and more than half of them are not able to perform the last rites. Still, there are so many Ghant tied on the tree that just a look makes a person shiver from the dreaded pandemic”, says Abhimanyu Tiwari, a priest at Rasoolabad ghat of the city. In addition to this agony of the family members, who have lost their loved ones is the fact that performing the last rites are a mere symbolic act as it's almost impossible to observe all rituals during the pandemic. “I have lost my father but could not do all the ceremonies as there is a dearth of all the essential items in the markets just like the medicines, so I somehow convinced my priest to take the Dakshina in place of items, that I should have offered him as per the tradition”, said, Ashwani, a local.People are in pain because they are not able to perform the tarawih (13th-day rituals) and other rituals that should have been otherwise performed after the death of the family member. “These are painful times, the pain that would be remembered by generations to come as we have lost a family member and at the same time we cannot give peace to the departed soul because the entire family is struggling with Covid-19”, says a resident of Naini.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/surge-in-no-of-ghant-on-peepal-trees-an-indication-and-witness-to-covid-destruction/articleshow/82234985.cms||---

The consumers will also get SMSes informing them of the four days (between 1st and 25th of every month) during which the meter reading can be sent over the app. The dates fixed for meter reading are also mentioned on the power bills.  The power users are being encouraged to send the readings as the meter readers are unable to visit many sites due to the Covid related restrictions across the state. “Many societies have declared micro containment zones. MSEDCL will not be able to take the meter reading in such areas and hence the consumers can send their meter readings to us over our mobile app or on Mahavitran (www.mahadiscom.in) website,” added Kamble. “It will ensure that the bills are generated for the month and the consumers pay actuals for their power consumption during summer,” another official from Bhandup zone said. During the summer of 2020, consumers did not get actual readings in bills and were provided with average billing from December to February. “We do not want consumers to face a similar problem this summer,”added Kamble.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-send-meter-readings-to-msedcl-with-app/articleshow/82237253.cms||Somit Sen
---||Kolkata||Enforce Covid rules more strictly in West Bengal: EC||KOLKATA: Chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra and election commissioner Rajiv Kumar have asked Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay, DGP, home secretary, health secretary and CEO of Bengal to step up vigil against Covid and enforce the Disaster Management Act provisions stringently, pointing out the protocols were not properly followed during election campaigns. Chandra and Kumar held a meeting with the state officials on Saturday. Pointing out that the enforcing of the DM Act provisions had been less than adequate so far, EC officials directed that the state disaster management authorities must impose and monitor the implementation of the Covid safety norms during campaigns and take appropriate action in case of any violation during the poll process. But EC officials appreciated the state machinery for its flawless execution of Covid safety management and disposal of bio-medical waste at polling booths in the last six phases of the ongoing assembly elections. The EC asked the state officials to monitor Covid safety protocol compliance at polling booths and that they should request voters to visit the booths wearing masks. As Bengal holds the seventh phase of polling on Monday, 653 company of central force will be deployed at the booths of the 34 seats, 436 of which will assigned for three Bangladesh-bordering districts of Murshidabad, Malda and South Dinajpur. There, election will be held in 21 seats. Nine seats of Murshidabad will have 204 companies, six seats of Malda 122 company and six seats of South Dinajpur will have 110 companies. While 154 companies will be for nine constituencies of West Burdwan, 63 companies will be assigned to four seats in south Kolkata.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/enforce-cov-rules-more-strictly-ec/articleshow/82235611.cms||Debashis Konar

---||Hyderabad||10% of candidates in Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation fray hold post-graduates degrees||HYDERABAD: Nearly 10 per cent of the total 500 candidates contesting from various wards in the Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation are post-graduates. The civic body along with six other urban local bodies is going to polls on April 30. Interestingly, most of the post-graduates are aged below 40 years. While some of them are above 50, a few are more than 60 years of age. While candidates with PG degrees have been fielded by almost all the parties, including the TRS, Congress, BJP, Aam Aadmi Party, All India Forward Bloc, CPI and Jana Sena, independents have outnumbered their counterparts from political parties. Among the independents, as many as 22 are post-graduates. Some of them have even completed Ph D. The post-graduates are from various streams such as M Pharmacy, MA English, M Sc, M Com LLB, MBA and MA (social work), to name a few. The voters in the Greater Warangal municipal corporation have a wide variety of choices as there are graduates, businessmen, private employees, housewives, private teachers and even illiterates, all in the electoral fray from a total of 66 wards. Devarakonda Sujatha, contesting from ward number 1 reserved for Scheduled Castes (women) is an M Pharmacy and Ph D qualified candidate from Congress. This is the first time that she is contesting an election but exuded confidence of winning it. She said there are a lot of problems in the ward and she has solutions for them. “You need educated men and women to come into politics. The urge to do something for the people has brought me into politics,” she said. Her husband Deverakonda Ileshwar is also a Ph D holder and has been holding agitations against rising unemployment. Harika Reddy Gujjula from ward number 59 is an MBA. She is wife of Gujjula Srinivas Reddy, a former member of the core team of Rahul Gandhi. Both wife and husband are into politics to serve people. “Our work should remain in the hearts of the people,” she said. These are not isolated cases as Sampath Bijiri, a candidate from the Scheduled Tribe community, entered political fray from ward number 2. He has completed his PG in English from Kakatiya University.  “More educated people have started entering politics. It is good for the people and the country. I am here to serve and give my best for upliftment of not only my community but all sections of the society,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/10-of-candidates-in-gwmc-fray-hold-post-grad-degrees/articleshow/82235617.cms||Roushan Ali

In the first phase, no Remdesivir was allocated to Chandigarh. The administration on April 16 had written a letter to Cipla Limited and requested 5,000 Remdesivir vials. Sources said the UT health department officials had raised the issue after the first phase before UT administrator V P Singh Badnore and MP Kirron Kher to push the matter before the central government. Finally, on Saturday night, the Centre allocates 5000 Remdesivir to the Chandigarh administration The ministry of health and family welfare in their communication to states and UTs had said these allocations were "interim", made for the period from April 21 to April 30. As there is a shortage of Remdesivir and doctors in private and government hospitals writing this medicine in a prescription for Covid patient, there is a huge demand for this injection. Meanwhile, the administration is also working to find out a legal way to utilise 3,000 antiviral Remdesivir injections seized from the premises of a Baddi-based pharmaceutical company in connection with an illegal deal recently.  Sources said the administration has asked the police department to look into the possibilities, which can allow the administration to use these antiviral injections, which are already out of stock in this time of the pandemic. Doctors at PGI feel that some private doctors are prescribing Remdesivir indiscriminately and people out of fear are hoarding oxygen cylinders and Remdesivir at home, when it is for hospital stay only.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/centre-allocates-5000-remdesivir-to-chandigarh/articleshow/82235008.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The victim, Nidhi Paswan, was home alone when the three accused — Haider, Sariq and Riyan — barged into her house and slit her throat with a knife. While the other two managed to escape the crime scene, Haider was caught by the locals and handed over to the police. According to sources, Haider used to stalk Nidhi, who worked at a local beauty parlour, and often pass derogatory remarks. Taking cognisance of the crime, BJP legislator Deshraj Karanwal staged a sit-in protest in the locality and demanded immediate arrest of the assailants. The legislator was joined by the family members of the victim. “These men killed an innocent girl brutally in broad daylight. They must be put behind the bars and the law should take its course against them,” said MLA Karanwal.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Industry chips in, as Covid-19 battle turns fierce||AHMEDABAD: Even as the government is pulling out all stops to fight the fierce second wave of Covid-19, trade and industry has once again chipped in to aid the efforts of controlling the spread and breaking the chain of transmission. Last year, when the pandemic began, Gujarat Inc had opened its purse and donated wholeheartedly to contain the Covid-19 spread. It also distributed protective gears such as masks, sanitizers and PPEs. Unlike last year, the businesses and companies this year are helping by producing and supplying medical oxygen, voluntarily staggering working days, shutting down markets and shops and providing logistics support to ferry essential goods. Stepping up oxygen supply As the entire country is grappling to maintain an adequate supply of medical oxygen amid an unprecedented increase in demand for oxygen, entities such as Reliance Industries Ltd, Indian Farmers Fertiliser Co-operative Limited (IFFCO) and Krishak Bharti Cooperative Limited (KRIBHCO), Gujarat State Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited (GSFC) and Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizer and Chemicals Ltd (GNFC) and ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India Ltd have stepped in to provide medical oxygen to hospitals. Reliance Industries Ltd has ramped up production of medical grade oxygen at its Jamnagar oil refineries to 700 tonnes a day. The oxygen is being supplied to states like Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. Leading fertilizer maker IFFCO is installing a plant to manufacture oxygen at its unit located in Kalol, Gandhinagar. The plant is expected to start operation soon, and it will have the capacity to produce 200 cubic metres of oxygen per hour. Another fertilizer major from the cooperative sector, KRIBHCO, is also at an advanced stage of setting up an oxygen plant at its Hazira units. The oxygen from these plants will be supplied free of cost to hospitals. State-run GSFC has also begun producing medical oxygen at its facility in Vadodara and started supplying oxygen to hospitals in Vadodara. Another state PSU, GNFC has also started production and supply of medical grade oxygen to cater to the rising demand for oxygen from hospitals. Joining forces to set up Covid care facilities The 950-bed Dhanvantari Covid Hospital, developed by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), central and state government agencies at Gujarat University Convention-cum-Exhibition Centre on GMDC ground in Ahmedabad — is funded by the state-run GSPC Group companies from their corporate social responsibility (CSR) outlay. Out of the Rs 20 crore earmarked, about Rs 10 crore has already been released for the hospital, said sources. As part of its efforts to aid in containing the current surge of coronavirus infections, CREDAI Ahmedabad-GIHED, a body of city-based real estate developers, has planned to set up a Covid care centre at its corporate house located off Sindhu Bhavan Road in Shilaj area. The establishment of this proposed 25-bed centre is, however, subject to the availability of oxygen supply and Covid care medical staff said members of the association. The Union home minister, Amit Shah, on Friday also announced that a 1,200-bed Covid hospital would be set up at Gandhinagar helipad by DRDO and Tata Trust shortly. Kutch industrialists to facilitate 100 oxygen concentrators While the unavailability of oxygen cylinders is a concern, members of the Federation of Kutch Industries’ Association (FOKIA) have placed orders for some 100 oxygen concentrators. “We have made a payment of Rs 40 lakh and are expecting delivery on April 27. We plan to collaborate with local NGOs here who have been working with us from time to time and will send the oxygen concentrators to them on a rotational basis,” said Nimish Phadke, MD, FOKIA. The industry association plans to supply oxygen to Covid-affected people in the industrial belts of Kutch, Bhuj, Nakhatrana, Bhachau and Gandhidham too. It also supplied ventilators to hospitals as well. GCCI to aid logistics for oxygen cylinders in Ahmedabad Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) has set up a special task force to provide logistics support for oxygen cylinders in Ahmedabad. Similar initiatives are being undertaken by other regional chambers of commerce and industry in other parts of the state, too. “We have procured cylinders which we will get filled from various oxygen suppliers and sent to private hospitals in Ahmedabad and surrounding areas, which do not have their own tanks,” said Natubhai Patel, president, GCCI. “To start with, we have provided some 200 cylinders to the Ahmedabad collector and we are looking at filling at least 200 cylinders in a single day. We will also collect the cylinders back from the private hospitals and get them refilled and supplied again,” Patel added. Jewellers, traders, tour operators appeal for shutdowns In Ahmedabad, several trade associations and those of tour operators and jewellers have appealed for shutdowns of different durations. For instance, Travel Agents’ Federation of India (TAFI) – Gujarat chapter, appealed to its members to shut offices till April 30, in a bid to help break the chain. “At least 80 members of TAFI in Ahmedabad and some 120 more in other parts of Gujarat have decided to keep offices shut. The business did take a hit, but the safety of employees comes first, and this time, we are better equipped to let our colleagues work from home,” said Manish Sharma, chairman, TAFI – Gujarat. Meanwhile, Jewellers’ Association of Ahmedabad (JAA) in addition to other Manek Chowk Jewellers’ Association and Ratanpole Gold Silver Jewellery Merchants’ Association recently appealed to their members to keep markets shut till April 30. “After observing a self-lockdown over the weekend, we decided to keep markets shut in the interest of the safety of employees and customers,” said Jigar Soni, president, JAA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/industry-chips-in-as-covid-19-battle-turns-fierce/articleshow/82237250.cms||Kalpesh Damor

The party has also questioned the need to spend Rs 3,408 crore on the Central Vista redevelopment project in Delhi and Rs 15 crore on a memorial for former chief minister Manohar Parrikar. “It is shocking that the central public works department issued the tender on April 20 inviting bids for construction of a new common central secretariat for its ministries with an estimated cost of Rs 3,408 crore,” said state Congress president Girish Chodankar. Chodankar said the two projects were clear evidence of BJP’s misplaced priorities. He said that no help could be expected from the state government which is focused on electoral gains and cheap publicity through the ‘Tika Utsav’ vaccination drive. “This unwanted and non-priority wasteful expenditure is incurred when the Centre has no funds to provide free Covid vaccines to all states. The local BJP government has no money to provide free treatment to Covid patients in private hospitals even after the occupancy of the beds in government hospitals is full,” Chodankar said. He said that the situation in Goa is horrific, with medical staff completely exhausted and people running from pillar to post begging for medical oxygen, medicines, hospital beds and other supplies. On Saturday, Goa hit a record high of 1,540 new Covid-19 cases, taking the state’s count of active cases to 12,007. The death toll for the state has hit 994 with 17 people succumbing to the pandemic in the last 24 hours. “The government is clueless in deciding about the future course of action. This sad situation has arisen only because the BJP government did not care for the welfare of common man,” Chodankar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-wasting-money-instead-of-building-medical-infra-cong/articleshow/82236262.cms||---

State transport undertakings, like WBTC, SBSTC, NBSTC, have instructed conductors not to allow people without masks. In a recent meeting at the public vehicles department, it was decided proper wearing of masks on public transport should be given importance. “We were badly hit during the lockdown.

The small and lively hill city has never seen death from such close quarters before. At least six persons have died in the last 10 days and another 250 people are currently infected with Covid-19. The absence of a dedicated Covid hospital in the city has only added to the woes. The residents are forced to travel 35-km downhill to Dehradun to get to hospitals, which are already crammed with patients. “The residents are battling to access healthcare. There is no Covid-19 hospital in Mussoorie. All patients are going to Dehradun where it is extremely difficult to find hospital beds. Residents are even struggling to get oxygen cylinders,” says Rajat Aggarwal, president of Mussoorie Traders Association. And there is no Covid-dedicated ambulance in the city to take patients to hospital. “We came to know that in Dehradun district there are just two 108 Covid ambulances. And they are seldom available for Mussoorie residents,” Aggarwal said. Another resident said, “I have been struggling to get a hospital for my aunt, whose oxygen level has dropped to 80. She is having trouble breathing. But despite all efforts, no hospital bed could be found in Dehradun.” When TOI spoke to state cabinet minister and Mussoorie MLA Ganesh Joshi, he assured that a Covid hospital will soon be set up in Mussoorie. “Seven more specialist doctors have been appointed at sub-district hospital at Mussoorie,” he said. “The town has a population of around 30,000. And our main focus is on vaccination. At seven vaccination centres, we are vaccinating 250 to 300 people every day. And more than 9,000 doses of vaccines have already been administered. A dedicated Covid ambulance for the town is expected to be functional next week,” sub-divisional magistrate, Manish Kumar said. He also said that administration was strictly enforcing the norms of home isolation for COVID positive patients apart from contact tracing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/queen-of-hills-gasps-for-oxygen-at-least-6-dead-in-10-days-over-250-active-cases/articleshow/82235014.cms||Anmol Jain

The state’s aid to labourers will cost the exchequer Rs 10 crore. He also announced that government offices, which were initially to be closed from April 23 to April 25 for sanitization, would now be closed till April 28. The extension was announced in view of the rising Covid-19 cases. The order issued by secretary (health) Pankaj Kumar Pandey mentions that the offices will remain closed but officers and employees were advised to keep their mobile phones on as they can be called to the office for any emergency situation. The all-party meeting, done through a video conference, was attended by senior leaders of the BJP, Congress and Uttarakhand Kranti Dal (UKD), including former chief minister Harish Rawat, leader of Opposition Indira Hridayesh and UKD chief Diwakar Bhatt. “I informed them (attendees of the all-party meeting) that we have acquired oxygen and are even supplying it to other states.

Cops standing in a line with different posters saying — “I have 2-year-old kid”, “but we can’t go home”, “because we care for you”, “you are our family”, “stay home for your family”, “my mother is sick”, “my wife cares for me”, have been widely circulated. Inspector general of police (Agra range) Naveen Arora said that these steps are innovative ways to create awareness among masses that "how important it is to be at home and follow Covid guidelines". “We all are working at odd hours and there is a need to understand that we are out only for public safety,” he said. Mainpuri superintendent of police Avinash Pandey said that people are very much connected to social media and videos are the best way to convey messages to them. “Police forces are working day and night and performing their duties in odd hours. They are not going home because of the pandemic. In this tough time, people should understand and follow the Covid protocols,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/mainpuri-police-gives-covid-19-safety-tips-via-video-messages/articleshow/82235027.cms||---
---||Mumbai||36.3% Mumbaikars have antibodies: 3rd sero survey||Mumbai: More than a third of Mumbaikars have antibodies to the Covid-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus, the results of the third sero survey conducted just as the vaccination drive started in January reveal. The BMC released the survey data on Saturday, stating that 36.3% of 10,197 Mumbaikars had antibodies. The significance of the survey is that it had representation from both slums and non-slums pockets in each of the 24 civic wards in the city. While 41.6% positivity has been found in slum areas, the figure is 28.5% for non-slum areas. The first two surveys had found 57% and 45% positivity in Mumbai’s slum areas. “The survey shows that the antibody levels in non-slum areas has been rising since the first survey conducted in July 2020,” said Dr Daksha Shah, deputy executive health officer from the BMC. The antibody level in non-slum areas was 16% during the first survey (July 2020) and 18% in the second (August 2020). “There is a fall in antibody levels in the slums, but this in line with emerging scientific evidence about dropping levels over time,” Dr Shah said. The solution, according to BMC officials, is to speed up vaccination to boost the antibody levels. “Although 28.5% of the non-slum areas have shown antibodies, it is not adequate. Clearly, there are many who are still vulnerable to the virus and need to be vaccinated at the earliest,” Dr Shah said. The latest survey also showed that more women (37.1%) than men (35%) had antibodies. During the first two surveys, the BMC staff collected samples from various colonies after taking informed consent from patients. For the third survey, it looked at samples submitted at civic dispensaries as well as private laboratories such as Metropolis and Thyocare. These samples were tested for antibodies at the Molecular Biology Laboratory housed at the BMC’s Kasturba Hospital premises. “Considering that more patients during the second Covid wave hail from non-slum areas, the third survey’s findings correspond to the current on ground situation,” said a senior civic official. While the third survey was conducted to assess the antibody levels at the start of the vaccination drive, the BMC plans to conduct another survey as soon as a sizable number of the population gets vaccinated. It would show the level of antibodies in the community after the vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/36-3-mumbaikars-have-antibodies-3rd-sero-survey/articleshow/82237261.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The sharp increase in demand has exhausted reserve stocks of the medical stores in the state capital. The owners of the medical stores in the city claim that the demand initially led to a rise in the prices of these equipment but now the shops have almost run out of them. Sanjeev Narula, a medical store owner near Nehru Colony, told TOI, “The supply of branded pulse oximeters and steamers has stopped completely. The suppliers in Delhi and Mumbai have also run out of pulse oximeters and steamers.” Another medical store owner near the Clock Tower said, “I have returned more than 50 customers asking for pulse oximeters since today (Saturday) morning. The market has a few units of locally-made equipment which come without any warranty.” When asked the reason behind this massive demand, the drug store owner said, “The sharp increase in demand is the direct outcome of the rising Covid-19 cases.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Will take a call on free vaccine for 18-45 on May 1, says deputy CM Ajit Pawar||MUMBAI: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said on Saturday that a five-member committee led by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte had been empowered by the cabinet to take decisions on gobal tendering for Covid-19 vaccines and remdesivir without seeking any clearance. The state government had last week announced that it would import vaccines available in the international market if required. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had held a meeting with Serum Institute of India CEO Adar Poonawalla last week and was informed that all the production that Serum does till May 24 has been booked for the Centre. Thackeray is in talks with Covaxin manufacturer Bharat Biotech. Pawar said that Thackeray is keen that vaccinations for the 18-45 age group begins from May 1, which is Maharashtra Day. On whether the state would give the vaccine free for all under this category, Pawar said a final announcement on this will be made by Thackeray on May 1 but the state will appeal to all those who can afford it to pay for it. “Like the ‘Give up LPG subsidy campaign’, we can also appeal to those who can afford to pay for the vaccine,” Pawar said. Only three lakh people could get vaccinated across the state on Friday as against 3.74 lakh on Thursday. In Mumbai, long queues were seen at most centres. Only 37,489 could be vaccinated on Saturday compared to the 48,280 on Friday. “The BMC has no stocks and centres will hold a limited drive with their remaining stocks on Sunday,’” said a BMC official. Late on Saturday, the BMC announced that only 30 out of the 59 public vaccination centres and seven out of the 73 private centres would operate on Sunday. “Priority will be given to those who come for their second dose,” said a release.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-will-take-a-call-on-free-vaccine-for-18-45-on-may-1-says-dy-cm/articleshow/82236279.cms||Bhavika Jain

However, the district authorities claimed that they have 24-hour back up of oxygen supply and there was no need to panic. UP Ambulance Operator Welfare Association’s Mathura unit president Shiv Kumar claimed that ambulances have been parked for the past three days as they have not received enough oxygen supplies. “When we approached the oxygen dealers in the town, we were told that the oxygen is only meant for a few hospitals,” he said, adding that the dealers asked them to get it in writing from authorities if they wanted supplies. “We have been facing this problem for the past 3-4 days,” he said. Sub-divisional magistrate Ramdutt Ram said that they have been directed to get the oxygen from Universal [Refinery] and claimed that they have 24 hours of back-up oxygen. “Our priority is to provide oxygen cylinders to ambulances and hospitals and we are making all efforts to do so,” he said. In case any problem arises, the operators can directly contact the police or SDM, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/no-oxygen-supply-ambulance-operators-in-mathura-block-road/articleshow/82235054.cms||---

Stating that the cultivation area also grown significantly due to improved ground water levels following filling up of water bodies from irrigation projects, he said paddy will be procured from farmers through procurement centres being set up. “Right from taking up the Rs 270 crore underground drainage project to shifting monkeys, stray dogs and pigs outside the municipal area to affectively dealing with the mosquito menace, the TRS government has transformed Siddipet into a clean city,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/harish-vote-for-those-in-regular-touch/articleshow/82235625.cms||---

Raut, along with animal husbandry minister Sunil Kedar and relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar, reviewed the Covid-19 vaccination programme and the pandemic situation in the district on Saturday. The minister stressed giving top priority to vaccination along with increase in beds to overcome the current crisis. “Government has permitted only online registration for vaccination of 18-plus. Necessary arrangements should be made so that 1 lakh people are vaccinated in a day from May 1. Accordingly, demand for vaccine doses should be placed with the central government,” he said. Collector Ravindra Thakare informed that the district has 364 vaccination centres, of which 187 are in the city and 177 in rural. The district can inoculate one lakh people per day with existing centres itself if considered 300 people per day at each centre. NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar told TOI, “Plan was to increase 40 more centres in the city. Necessary preparations have already been started. There will be separate counters and queues for second dose and first dose at all centres,” he said. Government officials also held a meeting with the officials of NMC, ZP, district administration and state’s public health department on Saturday and explained revised guidelines which will come into effect from May 1. As per guidelines received by the NMC, registration will be allowed for 18-plus people from April 28. On-spot (walk-in) registration and vaccination will not be allowed. Dr Chilkar said, “NMC is operating registration counters at all 10 zones. Also, there are 100 teams registration at special camps. People who are unable to register on mobile can avail these facilities,” he said. Last month, Raut and divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar had set target of vaccination of 40,000 people per day and coverage of all 45-plus people by April end. Vaccination was over 40,000 only on two days in the first week and declined to below 30,000 per day in second week. Now the achievement is 15,000 per day in third week. Less than 50% eligible people have taken the jab in the district till date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/raut-sets-1-lakh-per-day-vax-target-from-may-1/articleshow/82235639.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The shell-shocked farmer from Jetpur went to attend his condolence meeting and he came to know that an oxygen cylinder is now lying unused there. He instinctively knew that it was indication for him to do greater good. Wasting no time, Vala collected the cylinder and reached home opening not only its doors for the needy patients, but his heart too. The 51-year-old farmer opened the ground floor of his three-story building for Covid positive patients. Soon, news spread in the small industrial town and within 10 days, Vala, along with his family, now takes care of 15 patients under his roof. Jetpur, located about 70km from Rajkot city, is well-known for its saree industry and has a population of around three lakh. However, the town too is suffering the same woes like its bigger counterparts elsewhere from acute shortage of beds and oxygen cylinders for Covid treatment. It all began with one patient, but Vala’s magnanimity soon pushed up the number of people wanting beds with oxygen and he soon had to allot the parking space and a room on the ground floor too for patients. Vala told TOI, “I wanted to do something for the society during the adverse times but didn’t know what to do. It was then that my guru, Indrabharti Maharaj, asked me to start serving Covid patients. I started this service 10 days ago at present 15 people are taking treatment.” Vala wanted to send his family to their native in Amreli district looking at their safety, but driven by the same sense of service the family denied leaving him alone. Today, his wife, and daughter studying in Class XII besides son studying in Class VIII are fully devoted to the cause of community service. On the second floor of their house, Vala runs a kitchen to feed the patients and their relatives. He also orders food from nearby restaurants. Female attendants of patients are allowed to sleep on the second floor at night while Vala and his family live on the third floor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/jetpur-farmer-offers-lifeline-to-helpless/articleshow/82235102.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Politicos urge KCR to postpone civic body polls||HYDERABAD: Former MP Konda Vishweshwar Reddy, Telangana Jana Samithi president M Kodandaram and educationist Chukka Ramaiah, among others, have urged chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to direct the State Election Commission (SEC) to postpone the April 30 municipal elections in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases and deaths. In a letter to KCR on Saturday, Vishweshwar Reddy along with eminent personalities said the assembly elections being held in West Bengal and other states cannot be cited as an excuse to hold polls in Telangana. The assembly election schedule for West Bengal and other states was decided when there was no second wave whereas the municipal poll notification in Telangana was issued at the peak of the second wave, he contended. The leaders said people are in panic due to a steep rise in cases and death toll. “In such a situation, conducting municipal elections is inhuman. Instead of implementing measures to contain the virus, the government’s persistence on conducting the elections is indirectly accelerating the transmission of the virus. This was already proved by the rapid increase in the number of cases during campaigning for Nagarjuna Sagar bypoll. A large number of state leaders were affected by coronavirus, including the chief minister,” they said. They also said the civic elections do not directly impact the state’s functioning. “So, there is no harm in postponing them for another six months or so,” they said. Nearly 6,000 Covid-19 cases are being reported daily. There is a severe dearth of medicines, testing equipment, ventilators, oxygen cylinders, rapid test kits, vaccines, medical staff and beds in hospitals to treat the existing cases let alone new cases. “Given the crisis, the state should declare a health emergency to prevent the spread of the virus,” Vishweshwar Reddy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/politicos-urge-kcr-to-postpone-civic-body-polls/articleshow/82235633.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Provide shelters to migrants: Telangana High Court||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court has asked the GHMC what steps it has taken to prevent exodus of migrant workers from the state. The judges directed GHMC commissioner D Lokesh Kumar to make use of newly-established night shelters for the benefit of migrant labourers. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy said: “Instill a sense of confidence in them. Persuade the migrant workers not to leave the city and not to rush to their native places.” The judges also verified with Lokesh Kumar whether the GHMC had set up any shelters nearer to the railway stations and bus stations. Lokesh Kumar, who appeared before the bench virtually, said 20 shelters have been set up in Hyderabad to accommodate the migrant workers. He also said the shelters at Begumpet and Secunderabad could accommodate up to 965 people. “Currently, only 265 persons are staying in them,” he said. The judges were reviewing Covid-related efforts of various agencies of the state. Advocate general BS Prasad said the state government is trying to prevent the massive outflow of migrant workers. “We know this exodus will affect several sectors like construction, infrastructure, etc, very adversely,” he said. Earlier., counsel for migrant labourers Vasudha Nagaraj urged the court to pass orders directing railways and the state government to make arrangements for the workers to enable them to go to their native places in a safe manner. “We cannot afford to even think of the massive migrant crisis witnessed last year,” she said. She also said there was no point in worrying over the exodus of the workers who were feeling anxious in the midst of rumours of an impending lockdown in view of the second wave of Covid-19. Senior counsel L Ravi Chander urged the court to direct the government to set up medicare facilities exclusively for the children of the migrant labourers||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/provide-shelters-to-migrants-hc/articleshow/82235646.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana government to vaccinate 18+ population free of cost from May 1||HYDERABAD: The Telangana government will administer Covid-19 vaccine free of cost to all people aged above 18 years, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao announced on Saturday. The state will spend Rs 2,500 crore on the vaccination programme beginning on May 1. CMO officials confirmed to TOI that the jab will be free only in government facilities. Those taking the vaccine in private hospitals will have to pay for the inoculation. In addition to the state’s own population, those who have migrated to Telangana from other states and those working in different sectors will also be administered free jabs. Of around four crore population in Telangana, 35 lakh have already been vaccinated. The rest would be covered in the free vaccination drive, the CM said. “Considering the importance of lives of the people, it is worth spending Rs 2,500 crore to vaccinate everyone,” the CM said and asked chief secretary Somesh Kumar and health department officials to make arrangements to administer vaccination to all. He said Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech is manufacturing the vaccine and several pharma giants, including Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, have come forward to produce the vaccine. Hence, there would be no dearth of vaccines, he said. The CM, who tested positive for Covid-19, said he would chair a high-level review meeting with officials on the free vaccination programme after undergoing the necessary medical tests and recovering fully. KCR, who is currently under isolation, said he would personally monitor the vaccination programme. In addition, KCR said necessary steps would be taken to see that there is no shortage of remdesivir, other medicines and oxygen required for treating Covid-19 patients. The government would go all out to protect people from coronavirus. Asking people not to panic, he said: “The government will ensure availability of beds in hospitals and medicines.” He appealed to the people to stay away from mass gatherings and processions. “People should not come out of their homes and maintain self-discipline. Welfare of people is important to the government and it will do all it can to protect them from coronavirus,” the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-govt-to-vaccinate-18-popn-free-of-cost-from-may-1/articleshow/82236296.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Goa||FC Goa, Al Rayyan hunt for first ACL win||Margao: When Laurent Blanc landed at Barcelona in 1996, Juan Ferrando was with the team’s youth side, an energetic ball boy whenever home games were being played at the Camp Nou. Blanc was an influential name and among the best in business who went on to win the World Cup with France a year later. Ferrando was just 15, trying to make it as a professional player. A knee injury brought an early end to his dreams, but he’s now making a mark as a coach, pitting his wits against individuals he grew up idolising. “This is life,” said the FC Goa coach as his team prepares to take on the might of Blanc’s Al Rayyan at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Monday. “We are now playing against Al Rayyan, managed by someone who’s been at a very high level. For us it’s a great opportunity to play against them.” Nobody in India has had such an opportunity before. Goa are the first team to play in the group stages of the AFC Champions League. They did well in the first three games with two draws and a narrow loss against Persepolis FC. But the last game turned out to be embarrassing as the Iranian champions handed a 0-4 defeat. Ferrando was distraught, unable to sleep that night. Instead, he spent most of it discussing the match with director of football, Ravi Puskur. Of course, the Spanish coach had made eight changes to his team for the reverse clash, but didn’t expect the players to make so many individual mistakes. The Iranians were unforgiving. “The score was not good. It was a difficult moment. This experience is important for the team. I would have been worried if I thought this team cannot improve. But that’s not true. We can improve. We are not scared and the players are ready. I am sure that our image will be better than the last two games,” said Ferrando. Except for Princeton Rebello who is now ruled out of the ACL with injury, Ferrando will have a full-strength squad at his disposal. Captain Edu Bedia is expected to put on a brave front and play a part with defender Ivan Gonzalez also making himself available. Goa drew the opener against Al Rayyan goalless. Can they now do even better and notch their first win? “This is the second leg, so will be different,” said Ferrando. “When we started, everyone was ready, everyone had good fitness. Now after 10-12 days and four matches, there are injuries, cards and tiredness. Don’t forget we play against a very good team. It’s an important game for them too. There will be lot of motivation.” The major motivation for Al Rayyan will be to notch their first win and save themselves the embarrassment of losing against the debutants. The Qatar Stars League side became the first team to get knocked out of the group stages and have nothing more than their pride at stake. “It's true we are out of the competition but we are still not finished here. We will be motivated to perform our best against FC Goa, not only for this club but also for Qatar,” said Blanc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-al-rayyan-hunt-for-first-acl-win/articleshow/82247803.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Nagpur||Life comes a full circle: Lost job, got job due to Covid-19||Nagpur: Pravin Bhaisware had lost his job in March after the mall where he worked had shut due to Covid-induced restrictions. Living in the city’s biggest slum, Vandevi, in east Nagpur, Bhaisware was worried about the sustenance of his three-member family. “Until February, the mall where I worked retained me. But in March, I lost my job,” he said. A social worker referred him to a hospital for ward boy duty. So, he happily took up the job. He said it was god sent. Like Bhaisware, many who were rendered jobless due to the pandemic, have now found employment opportunities in the healthcare sector. The public health crisis has offered them a ray of hope with a wide array of job openings – from working as ward boys to sanitation workers in hospitals etc. “This pandemic has come as an unprecedented shock to the labour workforce and has created a need for new jobs and new skills,” said social activist and founder director of Centre for Sustainable Development Leena Buddhe. Neha Barai, a resident of a slum in west Nagpur, too shifted to the healthcare sector in October last year. “Earlier, I used to work in a readymade garments shop. But due to the extended lockdown, I faced hardships to earn a livelihood. Later, I joined as a temperature and oxygen screener in a hospital on Jaripatka ring road. The change in job has also increased my earnings from Rs 6,000 per month to Rs 10,000,” she said. Ukesh Agre, an undergraduate from Dhangarpura slum in the city, used to work in a chartered accountancy firm. With no job in hand and failing to land one, he has now started sanitizing homes of Covid patients. Like Agre, Mohan Kumar too has opted for the job of carrying out sanitization of homes and office premises. “My daily earnings have increased from Rs500 to Rs1000,” he said. Emulating Kumar, some of his friends too have taken up the same job. Some of these youngsters told TOI that their daily earnings was more than what they used to earn while they were employed. According to most of them, their monthly earnings have improved with the increased workload. A representative of a placement agency said the Covid-19 crisis has created a paradigm shift from a severe economic crisis to generating new job avenues. “The demand for new safety-related roles will continue to grow,” he said. Many private hospitals have started keeping guards to protect their establishments from vandalism by relatives of Covid patients. This has resulted in a rise in demand for security guards, admits Ajeet Singh, a security guards agency owner. He said that jobless youths were approaching him to work as security guards. Recently, many city youths who were working in Surat, returned and expressed their readiness to work as security guards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/life-comes-a-full-circle-lost-job-got-job-due-to-covid-19/articleshow/82235645.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Hyderabad||Bio E vax candidate gets SEC nod for phase III trials||HYDERABAD: Vaccine maker Biological E Ltd has received approval from the subject expert committee (SEC) of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) to start phase III clinical trials of its Covid-19 subunit vaccine candidate. The company is developing the vaccine with Texas-based Baylor College of Medicine (BCM). The phase III trials of the recombinant protein vaccine will be conducted on 1,268 healthy volunteers in the 18 to 80 age bracket across 15 sites in India to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the vaccine. This is part of a larger global phase III study, Biological E said on Saturday. The phase I and II trials were conducted on 360 healthy volunteers in the 18-65 years age group. The trials had commenced in the second week of November 2020. Two shots of the intramuscular vaccine were administered 28 days apart as part of the study that evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate, consisting of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus, at a three-dose level, adjuvanted with CpG 1018 plus alum, it said. BioE’s vaccine candidate includes an antigen that is developed by the Texas Children’s Hospital Centre for Vaccine Development and in-licenced from BCM Ventures, BCM'S integrated commercialisation team, along with Dynavax Technologies Corporation’s advanced adjuvant CpG 1018. Terming the results of the phase I and II trials as “positive and promising”, Biological E Ltd managing director Mahima Datla said: “We believe that our candidate will become another effective global Covid-19 vaccine as we move forward into Phase III clinical trials.” Datla had earlier told TOI that the company was ramping up capacities to produce about 1 billion doses per annum of this vaccine. “Having our Texas Children’s and Baylor vaccine construct advance into phase III clinical studies in India and globally, highlights the importance of advancing traditional protein-based vaccine platforms, which now brings added hope for a people’s vaccine to be scaled and deployed in low and middle-income settings,” said Dr Maria Elena Bottazi, associate dean, National School of Tropical Medicine (NSTM) at BCM, & co-director of Texas Children’s Hospital Centre for Vaccine Development (TCHCVD). The clinical trials of the vaccine are being supported by Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) as well as the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC). In addition to this vaccine, Biological E already has a tie-up with drug giant Johnson & Johnson for manufacturing over 600 million doses of its single-shot vaccine — Ad26.COV2.S — in India. It will get funding from the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to produce at least 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by the end of 2022 under the Quad initiative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bio-e-vax-candidate-gets-sec-nod-for-phase-iii-trials/articleshow/82235654.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Hyderabad||Telangana revenues face pandemic heat, govt to delay payments||HYDERABAD: The heat of the pandemic is being increasingly felt by the state government, which has reportedly imposed restrictions on release of funds and payment of bills to various departments and contractors. The government — already faced with severe revenue shortfall — has asked the treasury wing not to release bills except in case of important and emergency works until further orders. The government has also put new schemes and projects on hold for the time being. The decision has been taken following a dip in the state revenues due to rising Covid-19 cases, night curfew and restrictions on various events. “Every month, the state gets about Rs 12,000 crore revenues that include Rs 8,000 crore state-owned taxes from excise, commercial taxes and other sources. Another Rs 4,000 crore is accrued from central pool and borrowings. It is estimated that the state suffered a loss of Rs 1,500 crore revenue in this month due to night curfew and restrictions in place due to the pandemic,” a senior CMO official told STOI. Officials said the impact on excise revenues could have been known this month, but with GST and commercial taxes revenue still to be counted, the overall impact would be reflected only in the next month’s revenues, the loss of which is expected to double i.e, around Rs 3,000 crore, officials said. Alarmed with the situation, the government has postponed the payment of hiked salary to the state government employees. The CM had earlier announced 30 per cent salary hike last month and promised it would be paid from April. But, the dwindling revenues had forced the government to defer the hiked payments, an official said. Apart from regular commitments like payments of salaries, releasing subsidies, schemes and pensions, the state government has to earmark funds for free vaccination to above 18, which is expected to cost about Rs 2,500 crore. The CM n Saturday announced free vaccination to all people in the state. Interestingly, some schemes, which were announced earlier like comprehensive land survey, which costs about Rs 350 crore and other budgetary provisions to various departments, have been put on hold temporarily. “If the situation continues like this, the state budget allocations may go haywire like previous financial year,” a senior government official admitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-revenues-face-pandemic-heat-govt-to-delay-payments/articleshow/82235652.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Dehradun||Liquor not an ‘essential commodity’, vends will now be closed during curfews: CM Rawat||Dehradun: Chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat at an all-party meeting on Saturday said that liquor is not an “essential commodity” and shops vending it would close at 2 pm and remain closed on weekends like all other commercial establishments. During the weekend lockdown on Saturday, liquor vends in Dehradun, Rishikesh and Mussoorie remained open till 7 pm and the ones in Haridwar district till 2 pm. Liquor has been put under the “essentials category” by the administration. On Saturday, with liquor shops remaining open in Dehradun, revellers could be seen consuming liquor in the open at spots like the Old Mussoorie Road. Incidentally, while liquor shops stayed open, grocery shops which sell daily essentials were closed. Sandeep Kothiyal, a resident of Race Course area said, “We had assumed the grocery shops will be open at least till evening but it was surprising to find that all of them were closed while liquor vends were open.” Officials when queried claimed that grocery shops, too, come under the essentials category but they had themselves downed shutters on Saturday. The CM meanwhile said that the situation regarding liquor shops will be changed. “For us, public health is the priority, not excise revenue. Therefore, I have directed state authorities to ensure that liquor shops are closed at 2 pm on weekdays and are not opened on weekends, in accordance with the latest curfew norms that apply to all commercial establishments,” he told TOI. Residents also alleged that people were moving around freely during the lockdown, especially in interior lanes, as checking wasn’t stringent. Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC) carried out sanitisation drives in several parts of the city. Officials said 2.90 lakh litre disinfectant liquid had been sprayed at public places and containment zones. Residents said that like last year, the administration must also make arrangements like mobile vans, which can supply vegetables and milk, so that people do not have to step out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/liquor-not-an-essential-commodity-vends-will-now-be-closed-during-curfews-cm-rawat/articleshow/82234538.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘Set up oxygen plants at dist hospitals, like in Nandurbar’||Mumbai: Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has told collectors in the state to follow Nandurbar pattern for enhancing oxygen supply at hospitals. In September 2020, when there was steady declined in Covid-19 cases, Nandurbar collector Rajendra Bharud set up a liquid oxygen plant at the district hospital at a cost of Rs 85 lakh. In January and February he set up two more plants, following which the capacity of oxygen plants in the district increased to 2,400 litres per minute. A private hospital too set up a plant of 600 litres per minute, while the state will set up a third plant at the district hospital. Chief secretary Sitaram Kunte said Nandurbar pattern was being implemented in the state. A senior bureaucrat said if district collectors take the lead it should not be difficult to tackle the shortage. “We have huge funds at the disposal of district collectors. Besides, funds from district development plan and state disaster relief fund and corporate social responsibility funds are available at the disposal of collectors. They must use these funds judiciously. The state government has passed an order to provide for setting up of oxygen plants,’’ he said. He said since it is an imported technology for generating oxygen from air, state government will have to mount pressure on centre and foreign firms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-set-up-oxygen-plants-at-dist-hospitals-like-in-nandurbar/articleshow/82236323.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Covaxin jacks up prices, private hospitals to pay Rs 1,200 a shot||HYDERABAD/MUMBAI: Indigenous Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin will be priced at Rs 600 per dose for state governments and Rs 1,200 for private hospitals, its developer Bharat Biotech said on Saturday. For private hospitals, the increase in the vaccine price will be as much as eight times the current supplies they are getting through the central government. Similarly, state governments will pay Rs 600 per shot -- four times more than the price at which the Centre will get the vaccine. At these rates, for private hospitals, Covaxin will come at twice the cost of Serum Institute of India’s Covishield, which will be sold at Rs 600. For states too there will be a difference of Rs 200 per shot. Bharat Biotech, however, intends to keep prices for the central government unchanged at Rs 150, unlike Serum Institute, which is seeking to increase the rate for the Centre to Rs 400 a shot. The Hyderabad-based company sought to defend its pricing plan suggesting that in the export market, the vaccine price has been pegged at $15-20 per dose (Rs 1,125-1,500). The action is set to come under the scanner, with Serum Institute already facing flak. On Saturday, Serum Institute CEO Adar Poonawalla had to issue a statement justifying the price increase on the grounds that it was required to make it sustainable for the company to invest in scaling up capacity. The company maintained that Covishield was the most affordable Covid-19 vaccine. The initial supply price of Covishield for all government immunization programmes including India's, has been the lowest, he said. The low price was also possible as advance funding was available, the company argued. “The price of the vaccine is still lower than a lot of other medical treatment and essentials required to treat Covid-19 and other life-threatening diseases,” Poonawalla said. Only a limited portion of Serum Institute’s volume will be sold to private hospitals at Rs 600 per dose, he said. “Government procurement for country-wide immunization programmes in all countries including India has been at a far lower price as the volumes are very large,” the statement added. Giving the rationale for its pricing strategy, Bharat Biotech said: “Covaxin is an inactivated and highly purified vaccine, making manufacturing expensive due to very low process yields. All costs towards product development, manufacturing facilities and clinical trials were deployed primarily using internal funding and resources of Bharat Biotech.” It added that recovering costs is essential in the journey of innovation towards other vaccines such as intranasal Covid-19, Chikunguniya, Zika, Cholera and others. “Our core mission for the last 25 years has been to provide affordable, yet world-class healthcare solutions for the globe,” the company said. Bharat Biotech intends to reserve over 50% of its Covaxin capacity for central government supplies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covaxin-jacks-up-prices-pvt-hospitals-to-pay-rs-1200-a-shot/articleshow/82236316.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Goa||Unlike ISL, have to work more here to help in defence: Ortiz||Margao: Having picked up points against Al Rayyan and Al Wahda, and kept clean sheets too, FC Goa should be reasonably confident they can get more from their remaining two group matches in the AFC Champions League. The debutants stunned Al Rayyan and Al Wahda in successive games with gritty draws. Then Persepolis FC showed them just why they made it to two ACL finals in three years with commanding wins. But as Goa now prepare to play their last two league games, is there confidence within the team that more can be done? “More than confidence, there is a lot of motivation to do well,” Goa winger Jorge Ortiz told TOI on Sunday. “We are a little bit tired, but that will not affect us. The mentality continues to remain the same. We will keep pushing ourselves to the limit to try and win these two games.” Ortiz was among the most impressive performers in the Indian Super League (ISL) this season. In his first season here, the Spaniard put his speed to good use, running through defences and scoring goals, whether he played on the wings or as a false nine, when star striker Igor Angulo was left on the bench. At the AFC Champions League, though, it’s been a different story. Up against the best in Asia, Ortiz has either been busy defensively, or kept quiet by markers who can read his moves and keep pace. “On the pitch (here in ISL), the time and space you have on the ball is different (compared to ISL). In the ISL, lot of teams tend to stick to one strategy throughout the game, so you can continue to do what you are doing constantly. “In ACL, teams adapt a lot quicker and analyse a lot more deeply, so once you do something, you won’t have the chance again. You have to improvise and understand what you are trying to do. You have to try and take advantage every single time you get the opportunity,” said Ortiz. Opportunities have been few and far between. Ortiz did make some promising runs, but the final touch has been missing. His shot on goal in the final minute against Persepolis brought the best out of Croatian goalkeeper Bozidar Radosevic. It is what Goa fans will expect him to do more often in the remaining two games. “I am satisfied with my performance as long as it helps the team. I always want to demand more of myself and perhaps I could do even more, but the difference is quite stark. “In the league, we are capable of dominating the ball, but here I have to work more to help in defence and it's definitely noticeable. I am very happy with how competitive we have been so far. We want to try and do more of the same,” said Ortiz.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/unlike-isl-have-to-work-more-here-to-help-in-defence-ortiz/articleshow/82247870.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Police nabbed the two accused, hailing from Hooghly, West Bengal, from Maharashtra’s Tumsar town on Saturday. According to the police complaint lodged by Kirit Mandliya, the accused — Abdul Kundkar (29) and Samrat Malik (22) —had broken into his manufacturing unit in Madh street area of Junagadh and stole gold jewellery, weighing around two kg, worth Rs 90 lakh.

The police arrested Kundkar and Malik after raiding the house where the two were hiding and recovered jewellery worth Rs 65 lakh. Both the accused were residing in Junagadh since the last few years and working as jewellery-makers. “The police recovered 80% of the stolen jewellery. Samrat was working in this factory since last few years but he had some issues with the owner and because of the personal animosity he committed this crime along with his friend,” Ravi Teja Vasamsetty superintendent of police, Junagadh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/junagadh-thieves-held-from-maharashtra/articleshow/82235157.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||New Chief Justice of India Ramana takes charge, gets cracking||NEW DELHI: Justice Nuthalapati Venkata Ramana on Saturday took charge as the 48th Chief Justice of India after President Ram Nath Kovind administered oath of office to him at a brief ceremony in Rashtrapati Bhavan attended by Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu, PM Narendra Modi, law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, SC judges and a small number of dignitaries. Justice Ramana sought blessings of archakas from TTD and Srisailam Devasthanam before taking oath in the name of God to discharge his duties as CJI without fear or favour. Though Saturday is not a working day for judges in the court, the CJI drove straight to SC from Rashtrapati Bhavan and held a meeting with senior judges to discuss the future process to be adopted for adjudication of cases. Since the Covid pandemic took hold in India in March last year, SC has been dispensing justice through video-conferencing mode. Most judges were of the opinion that the virtual conference mode should continue for some more time till the Covid situation is brought under control. The CJI would continue his deliberation with the judges about advancing the summer break to allow the court to take measures to vaccinate all its staff and help out the families of the staff who have been infected with coronavirus. The CJI also took note of the representation by the Supreme Court Bar Association for introduction of a Rs 100 rupee lawyers welfare stamp to be affixed on each vakalatnama for creating a corpus that would be utilised for giving financial assistance to lawyers in distress because of loss of income due to disruption of physical hearing as well as the unfortunate families whose lawyer bread winners have succumbed to Covid. He is likely to meet SCBA office bearers next week over the issue. A staunch advocate of right to access to justice for the last man standing in the socio-economic hierarchy, Justice Ramana was a first generation lawyer born in an agricultural family in Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh. Leaving behind the student activist days, he had experimented briefly with journalism by working in a leading Telugu newspaper before choosing to become an advocate. He was appointed as judge of Andhra Pradesh HC in 2001, as chief justice of Delhi HC in September 2013 and a judge of SC in February 2014. Though a soft-spoken person, Justice Ramana has given many important and hard-hitting judgments including the ruling on providing 4G internet services in Jammu and Kashmir, where the government had suspended high-speed internet services after scrapping the special status of the state under Article 370 and bifurcated it into two Union Territories. Justice Ramana-led bench's ruling that "access to internet" is a fundamental right of the citizens was widely welcomed. A bench headed by him had also brought the office of the CJI under the Right to Information Act in its judgment in the case ‘SC Vs Subhash C Aggarwal’, breathing transparency into the highest office in judiciary. Justice Ramana-led bench had also directed speeding up trials, pending for years, against sitting and former MPs and MLAs. He faced accusations that were dismissed as false and motivated from Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy. Last month, then CJI S A Bobde had dismissed Reddy's complaint against Justice Ramana prior to recommending his appointment as his successor. Hours after Justice Ramana took oath as CJI, the AP chief minister tweeted: "Congratulations to Justice N V Ramana Garu on being sworn in as the CJI". As the new CJI, Justice Ramana will face many challenges in his tenure. most important being achieving a consensus in the Collegium, which now also comprises of Justices R F Nariman, U U Lalit, A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud, for filling the six vacancies in the SC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/new-cji-ramana-takes-charge-gets-cracking/articleshow/82236333.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Speaking to reporters, they said that they are planning to challenge the GO in the court concerned, stating that the accusations are baseless and due procedure to declare an organisation as unlawful was not followed by setting up a tribunal. “Organisations which were declared unlawful by Telangana government through this latest GO have never supported the activities of Maoists. On the contrary, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao during the Telangana agitation declared that Maoists’ agenda will be his agenda,” Civil Liberties Committee (CLC) president Laxman Gaddam said during a press conference. The members of CLC recalled how they fought legally in 2006 to lift the ban on Revolutionary Writers Association (RWA), when the then-Congress party declared it as unlawful, in the same way the Telangana government declared it in the latest case. In a GO by chief secretary Somesh Kumar, RWA, Telangana Praja Front (TPF), Democratic Students Organisation (DSO) and 13 other organisations were declared unlawful as they were accused of carrying out illegal activities, including having links with Maoists. “We have been taking up various people’s issues to highlight them so that the state resolves them. Never have we indulged in any activities of taking law into our hands,” CLC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/revoke-orders-declaring-16-groups-unlawful-clc-tells-govt/articleshow/82235753.cms||---

The countrymen, apart from their positive efforts to resolve the situation, should also be cautious of the conspiracies of these forces,” RSS general secretary (sarkaryavah), Dattatreya Hosabale said in a statement.

It is our firm belief we shall certainly overcome the situation by maintaining patience and keeping the morale up along with self-restraint discipline and mutual support,” Hosabale said. He said due to sudden worsening of the pandemic, people are facing shortage of beds, oxygen and necessary medicines in the hospitals. “In a large society like Bharat, the problems often gain gigantic proportions.

A team led by RFO, Swati Maheshkar, nabbed six persons and seized four canines, 12 nails and 15 whiskers from them. Maheshkar told TOI that acting on a tip-off, the team zeroed in on four suspects who were in the process of selling tiger body parts along Chek Boarda to Chek Nimbala road. The suspects had huddled near Check Borad village. The tiger body parts were recovered from a bag in possession of the suspects, identified as Ramesh Tekam, Surkiran Alam, Bharat Bawane and Lingo Bawne. “On interrogation done at RFO office of Chandrapur buffer range, the suspects revealed that they had obtained the tiger parts from Jiwandas Madavi and Namdev Atram three years back,” said Maheshkar. Madavi and Atram too were rounded up. Maheshkar said the suspects claimed that they had not poached the tiger, instead had collected the parts from a carcass they had found deep in the Tadoba buffer 4-5 years back. A team discovered scattered bones of the tiger from the spot where the suspects claimed they had found the body parts. The RFO claimed the spot is at the bank of nullah and most of the remains are likely to have washed away.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tiger-canines-and-nails-seized-six-arrested/articleshow/82235756.cms||Mazhar Ali

A week back, Pawar, who heads Pune’s Vasantdada Sugar Institute, wrote to heads of cooperative sugar factories, that premises of factories which have completed crushing can utilize their plants for production of oxygen. VSI director and former bureaucrat Shivajirao Deshmukh said in a letter to cooperative sugar factories that as most units have power-generation plants, it should not be difficult to concentrate on oxygen generation. “Pawar’s concept is good, but appears difficult in view of a resource crunch,’’ a senior bureaucrat said. He said to set up an oxygen plant it will require at least Rs 2 crore investment and at least six months to produce oxygen. Dharashiv Sugar Mill in Osmanabad district has started generating oxygen from its sugar mill-based ethanol plant.

However, it's too early to say that cases are declining, while we can confirm it only if it continues to go down for a few more days.” Total 639 people tested positive in Jamnagar district, while 301 people tested positive in Bhavnagar district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/rajkot-gets-500-new-cases-some-respite/articleshow/82235174.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Antibody levels fall in slums, up in non-slum areas, says Survey||Mumbai: More than a third of Mumbaikars have antibodies to the Covid-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus, according to the results of the third sero survey. “The survey shows that the antibody levels in non-slum areas have been rising since the first survey conducted in July 2020,” said Dr Daksha Shah, deputy executive health officer from the BMC. The antibody level in non-slum areas was 16% during the first survey (July 2020) and 18% in the second (August 2020). “There is a fall in antibody levels in the slums, but this in line with emerging scientific evidence about dropping levels over time,” Dr Shah said. The solution, according to BMC officials, is to speed up vaccination to boost the antibody levels. “Although 28.5% of the non-slum areas have shown antibodies, it is not adequate. Clearly, there are many who are still vulnerable to the virus and need to be vaccinated at the earliest,” Dr Shah said. The latest survey showed more women (37.1%) than men (35%) had antibodies. During the first two surveys, the BMC staff collected samples from various colonies after taking informed consent from patients. For the third survey, it looked at samples submitted at civic dispensaries as well as private laboratories such as Metropolis and Thyocare. These samples were tested for antibodies at the Molecular Biology Laboratory housed at the BMC’s Kasturba Hospital premises. “Considering that more patients during the second Covid wave hail from non-slum areas, the third survey’s findings correspond to the current on ground situation,” said a senior civic official. While the third survey was conducted to assess the antibody levels at the start of the vaccination drive, the BMC plans to conduct another survey as soon as a sizable number of the population gets vaccinated. It would show the level of antibodies in the community after the vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-antibody-levels-fall-in-slums-up-in-non-slum-areas-says-survey/articleshow/82236366.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The woman, who has been identified as Kanchan Gohil (45), reached the police station where she handed a note to the constable on duty before dousing herself with inflammable liquid and setting herself afire. The injured woman who received 80 percent burns was shifted to nearby hospital and later taken to Rajkot Civil Hospital for further treatment. According to police the reason for her drastic step is yet under investigation but they suspect it to be a fight with her neighbour for which an offence was also registered against her in 2014.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/woman-immolates-self-over-tiff-with-neighbour/articleshow/82235181.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Biker’s tiff with cop ‘not use of force’, 26-year-old let off||Mumbai: Observing that challenging authority does not amount to use of criminal force, a sessions court recently acquitted a 26-year-old Santacruz resident who was arrested in 2018 for arguing with a traffic cop after he was stopped for not wearing a helmet. “The arrogant behaviour of the accused may be termed as mannerless behaviour, but it is short of using criminal force and causing assault. Merely shouting or arguing does not amount to using criminal force or causing assault unless the shouting was imputing threat to commit injury and creating apprehension in the mind of the public servant that criminal force is about to be used,” the court said. The accused, Hitesh Gurav, was out on bail. The court also said that under the Motor Vehicles Act, an offender can be arrested for such a violation only if he refuses to disclose his name and address. The court said the accused had handed his licence to the cops. “Thus, it is clear that the informant [police constable Rajesh Savane] had no authority or power to carry the accused to police station by force by apprehending him. Therefore, it cannot be said that the informant was lawfully discharging his duty,” the court said. The court observed that since the the cop had used force in contravention of the provisions of the act, even if force was used by the accused, he cannot be held guilty of the offence under section of 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the Indian Penal Code. The maximum sentence under the section is five years jail. The prosecution said that on August 2, 2018, two cops were on patrol duty at Santacruz (west) around 1.30pm saw the accused riding without protective head gear. When they told him to pay a fine, he started arguing, and when his licence was taken and they insisted he come to the police station, he refused. The cops alleged that when they tried to “carry him” to the police station, the accused grabbed the collar of a cop. More cops were called and the accused taken to the police station. The court said there was no reliable and satisfactory evidence to prove the charges. “It is not proved that the informant was allotted the duty to take action in respect of not wearing protective head gear,” the court also said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bikers-tiff-with-cop-not-use-of-force-26-year-old-let-off/articleshow/82237444.cms||Rebecca Samervel

With the Covid-19 cases on the rise, we sourced N95 masks directly from a manufacturer and distributed them to about 300 registered members of our association. Each member was given five masks free of cost,” said Ravi Kumar, secretary, RK Nagar Welfare Association. The N95 masks were left on the compound walls of all the houses keeping in view safety of all the residents. “The mask distribution was the need of the hour considering the rise in Covid-19 cases across the city. The RWA has been pro-active in addressing all the issues of the residents,” said Seetharamam Nukala, a resident. The colony, which has about 500 houses with a population of 3,000 people, has been actively extending help to all its residents to fight the pandemic. Apart from distributing masks, the RWA is also regularly sanitising the area, providing essential items to those infected and even helping arrange for testing and vaccinations. “Even during the first wave, we had extended help to our residents by regularly sanitising the area. Now in the second wave, we ramped up our services wherein we regularly keep in touch with our residents through a WhatsApp group and spread awareness and information,” said Kumar. They have also donated three air coolers to Government Area Hospital, Malkajgiri, to beat the summer heat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rk-nagar-rwa-steps-up-gives-free-masks-to-people/articleshow/82235764.cms||Preeti Biswas
---||Nagpur||Search ops in Deshmukh’s house lasted for 14 hours||Nagpur: A Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) team of the anti-corruption unit (no.5) from Delhi and Nagpur conducted a 14-hour search operation at the Civil Lines home-cum-office of former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Saturday after an FIR was filed following the direction of the Bombay high court. Sources said he was questioned about certain matters relating to the operation. It’s learnt that CBI has collected laptops, computers, some electronic gadgets and documents after the operation which wound up at 10 pm. The high court had ordered CBI to conduct a ‘preliminary inquiry’ on April 5 following a petition filed by former Mumbai CP Param Bir Singh and a PIL by an activist. It was alleged that Deshmukh misused power for malpractices in transfer and posting apart from trying to extort Rs 100 crore through police officers. The PPE-kit clad CBI team was also accompanied by an independent witnesses whose presence was needed as per procedure. After entering Deshmukh’s house at around 8 am, the CBI team left the house at 6.30 pm following which even Deshmukh departed for his constituency, Katol, to visit a newly opened Covid care centre. However, all of a sudden, the CBI team returned around 7 pm. Deshmukh too was then called back and he arrived after 30 minutes. Finally, Deshmukh left for Katol after the CBI team departed at 10 pm. “CBI conducted a search at my place. I offered full co-operation to them,” said Deshmukh before leaving for Katol. Sources informed that CBI had come prepared with a ‘checklist’. They had earlier ignored some old and damaged computer systems but returned to pick them up. Bags were continuously being shifted from the house triggering rounds of speculation about their contents. This was the second time in two weeks that Deshmukh was being questioned by the CBI, the earlier occasion being in Mumbai. Apart from him, CBI also quizzed members of his office staff. On April 21, CBI had registered an offence against Deshmukh under section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, (amended) 2018 for making illegal demands and also section 120B of Indian Penal Code (IPC) for criminal conspiracy. CBI has also mentioned ‘unknown persons’ as accomplices of Deshmukh in the FIR registered in Mumbai by the Delhi team. The FIR stated Deshmukh and unknown others “have attempted to obtain undue advantages for improper and dishonest performance of their public duty”. The FIR also adds that Deshmukh was aware of API Sachin Vaze’s reinstatement after 15 years and allowing him to do maximum “sensational and important cases”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/search-ops-in-deshmukhs-house-lasted-for-14-hours/articleshow/82235769.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Lucknow||Queues drain hope after scramble for prescription||Lucknow: His elder brother was gasping for breath at home, so Ajay Mishra, a Lucknow University student, was since Saturday morning desperately looking for a doctor who could write a prescription for getting an oxygen cylinder. “I went to some nursing homes, but all refused to give a prescription saying they can’t write one without seeing the patient. When I requested for a home visit to examine my Covid-19 positive brother, all doctors refused,” said Mishra, who later got a prescription from a doctor with the help of a police officer who also helped in getting an empty jumbo cylinder for Rs 2,500. “I somehow got the cylinder refilled, but the oxygen level of my brother had dropped to 80% by then,” said Mishra. Getting a doctor’s prescription for oxygen became a big challenge for many others having Covid patients at home as beds were not available in hospitals. “Doctors are not examining patients at home. Beds are not available in hospitals. Then, who will give us a prescription,” said Diwakar Shukla, a teacher, standing in a queue outside an oxygen plant in Chinhat. “Administration should create a helpline for people like us. If patients are managed at home with oxygen supply, pressure on hospitals will also reduce,” he added. Officiating Lucknow DM, Roshan Jacob said doctor’s prescription has been made mandatory to check panic buying and hoarding. On creating a helpline for such people, Jacob said she will see how Integrated Covid Command Control Centre can help them. However, those who managed to get a prescription found long queues on reaching gas plants and were told they would get oxygen only after hospital supply was fulfilled. Nooruddin, who had left from Thakurganj for Talkatora at 4am confident he would be the first in the queue at the oxygen plant which opens at 7am, found others standing since midnight and his number was 125. “After standing in line for the whole day, they gave oxygen to only a few and told others to come tomorrow. My maternal uncle is critical and will die without oxygen” he said. After standing in a queue all night outside a plant at Chinhat without success, Kapil Mohan Chaudhary came to Nadarganj plant in the morning. “I have been standing in line for five hours. I have to get a refill for my friend who is critical at a hospital in South City. They have told us to arrange oxygen or take him home,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/queues-drain-hope-after-scramble-for-prescription/articleshow/82236378.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Refusal to pay fine to traffic cop is not deterring him from duty’||Mumbai: A sessions court has observed that a cop cannot compel a traffic offender to pay a fine and that refusing to cough up one does not by any stretch of the imagination amount to deterring of a public servant from discharging his duty. The court acquitted Mohammed Shaikh (23) who allegedly jumped the signal at Kurla in 2016 and was arrested for refusing to pay the fine. The cop said he used filthy language and tried to run him over. The court, however, observed that paying charges is voluntary act and one can’t be compelled by the police. “If accused was not ready to pay... the informant [cop] should have issued a challan or produced him in a magistrate court. Not doing so creates doubt in the case of prosecution,” the court said. Three witnesses including the cop who was the purported victim deposed during trial. The alleged incident took place on August 14, 2016 at 4.15 pm. During cross-examination, police naik Ashok Pawar admitted he did not issue achallan to the accused for jumping the signal. “This shows evidence of Ashok Pawar is not trustworthy. Soon after jumping of signal, he should have issue a challan... to the accused,” the court said. The court further said that since there are many improvements made by the cop in his deposition before the court, when compared to his version in the FIR, it was not trustworthy. It also pointed out that no independent witnesses were examined.The court also said that there was no evidence of the accused having assaulted the policeman. “Merely getting down from the bike and coming towards the policeman does not amount to any offence. So far as abuses are concerned, the contents of the FIR and facts deposed by Ashok Pawar before court are doubtful and not trustworthy. In such a situation, it is doubtful whether the accused had abused the informant,” the court said. —Rebecca Samervel||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-refusal-to-pay-fine-to-traffic-cop-is-not-deterring-him-from-duty/articleshow/82237460.cms||---
---||Rajkot||Kin harassed as hospitals ask for oxygen cylinders||RAJKOT: Even as the district collector has assured sufficient oxygen supply to every hospital, some of the private hospitals are still asking their patients’ relatives to arrange for own cylinders. This has resulted in long queues outside the oxygen filling station at Shapar. On Saturday, the district administration declared officially of getting sufficient oxygen and that there is no shortage now. It has also designated one agency at Shapar to provide oxygen to the relatives of those Covid patients who are taking treatment at home. However, most of the people queuing up for hours on end outside the agency quote hospital administration’s demand for oxygen. “My relative is in the hospital and I have been asked to manage oxygen as soon as possible,” said an attendant Gopal Parmar, which was echoed by another kin, Amit Bhatt. “My grandmother is in the hospital and we have been asked to arrange oxygen by this evening,” said Bhatt. Over 500 people are seen waiting to get a cylinder while many keep standing throughout the night too. President of Rajkot Medical Association, Praful Kamani said, “When a patient on oxygen gets critical it requires immediate double flow. That is why some hospitals might be asking to arrange for more cylinders. However, RMA has requested all the hospitals not to trouble patient’s relatives unnecessarily as the district administration is providing sufficient stock of oxygen now.” District collector Remya Mohan could not be contacted for comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/kin-harassed-as-hospitals-ask-for-oxygen-cylinders/articleshow/82235199.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Patients dying waiting for beds, oxygen & corona test reports||Lucknow: Dr RK Singh (72), a retired doctor from provincial medical services, had given his swab samples to a private lab after developing fever on Thursday. He developed breathlessness on Friday morning. His family started Covid medication, but as the condition deteriorated, the family tried to get him admitted to a hospital, but was denied admission as it did not had Covid test report. The family also arranged an oxygen cylinder at home but he died on Saturday morning. The test report is still awaited Not just the crisis of critical care beds and oxygen, delay in RT-PCR test results is also proving to be fatal for people. Overwhelmed with samples due to the skyrocketing transmission rate, the government supported and private labs are taking 3-5 days to give results. People start Covid treatment presuming they are Covid-19 positive, but do not get admission in hospitals because producing a test report is mandatory. In some cases, people are starting Covid medication only to find later that they are negative for Covid-19 and have some other disease with similar symptoms. “We even don’t know whether my father died of Covid or had some other illness. Since his blood oxygen level dropped, we presume that he had Covid-19. Had the report come earlier, his life could have been saved as it would have facilitated hospital admission,” said Singh’s daughter Aprajita. When Daliganj resident Sachin Singh left his home on Friday morning with his 52-year-old mother Ganga Devi gasping for breath with blood oxygen level 70 in the backseat of their car, he was optimistic about finding a hospital bed or even an oxygen support. Upon reaching KGMU Trauma Centre, Singh was referred by a doctor to go to the Covid emergency ward, but the staff there refused admission saying no oxygen supported beds were available and the patient didn’t have an RT-PCR test report. “Her Covid test was done on Monday and we were still waiting for the test results. I asked if they can’t provide a bed, they can at least provide an oxygen cylinder for the time being, but nobody listened. When I raised the alarm a doctor on duty then examined her, only to tell me that she was dead. Her oxygen level had dropped to 25,” he said. “Before leaving for hospital we had also called up Integrated Command Covid Centre (ICCC), but got no help,” he added. Another patient, Vatsala Maheshwai (46), who had all the symptoms of Covid died waiting for her test result from the pathology. “After calling for several hours, when we finally got connected to the ICCC, the staff told us that RT-PCR test report will be needed for hospitalisation,” said her husband Rajesh Kumar. “If the patient cannot breathe and we have gotten ourselves tested but not received the report, then does it mean that the patient will not be given treatment? Or are we not allowed to receive any help from the administration in this case," he asked. There are 24 private labs in the city authorised for Covid tests. These labs conduct over 5,000 tests through RT-PCR method daily. The three government supported labs at KGMU, SGPGIMS and RMLIMS together conduct over 25,000 RT-PCR tests per day, but since the number of samples collected daily are above 30,000, there is a huge backlog.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/patients-dying-waiting-for-beds-oxygen-corona-test-reports/articleshow/82236387.cms||Aditi Singh
---||Mumbai||Powai saree shop dacoity, stabbing: Trio, juvenile held in Mumbai||Mumbai: Four armed men, including a juvenile, that had stabbed a saree shop owner and robbed the establishment in Powai recently were arrested by the police. The prime accused had been released from prison on bail just four months ago. He had been jailed for having committed a murder at Vikhroli, said the police. On April 21, four men walked into a saree store located at Shivshakti Nagar in Powai. The men brandished a revolver and after issuing threats, one of them stabbed the store owner, Kishore Vyas, in the abdomen. The men could only find Rs 3,000 in cash, a silver stamp and a cellphone, collectively worth Rs 17,000, in the store. Vyas, 53, was rushed to a hospital where he was treated for the grievous injury. He was later moved to another hospital. He is currently out of danger. Based on the victim’s statement, the Powai police started their probe. They checked CCTV footage from the vicinity and found that the robbers had arrived in an app cab and left in an auto. “With the help of the cameras on the highway between Powai and Govandi, the cops tracked the cab to Thane and the auto to Bhandup,” said DCP Maheshwar Reddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/powai-saree-shop-dacoity-stabbing-trio-juvenile-held-in-mumbai/articleshow/82237532.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Lone warrior keeps Covid testing going on in Almora||ALMORA: By 6am every day, Jitendra Devrari, 33, is at work. Over the next 16 hours, he gets down to testing Covid-19 samples at breakneck speed. He is the only man in Almora who can. The hill town of Almora does not have a private testing facility. The only state-run testing centre is at the Almora Medical College, where Devrari is the sole microbiologist among 21 doctors who have been recruited. With a team of four lab technicians who collect samples and compile reports, Devrari has been working without a day off for close to six months now. “The government Covid-19 testing facility was set up with guidance from the principal of Almora Medical College, RG Nautiyal. I knew how crucial the responsibility was when I accepted the position,” said Devrari. “These days, the workload has increased. I am at the facility 24x7, testing samples day and night … Sometimes, I forget to eat or just don’t get the time to. But that is what is needed right now.” He lives close to the testing facility in Almora so “no time is wasted”. SC Gadkoti, medical superintendent of Base Hospital, which is attached to the Almora Medical College, said, “His presence has been a huge support for us. No matter what we need, how many samples we send, he doesn’t leave until all the samples for the day are tested.” Nautiyal added: “He has been shouldering the responsibility of the testing lab on his own since we started. It is very difficult to get doctors to come to the hills, but he didn’t seem unsure even for a moment.” The lab tests between 900 and 1,100 samples a day. “I have tested about 25,000 samples so far,” Devrari said. Had it not been for Devrari and his team, samples for Covid-19 tests would have to be sent to Haldwani and results would take days. Sometimes, samples would go missing. Now, with the lab set up in Almora, test results take four hours. Almora has had 4,302 Covid-19 cases so far, 597 of which are active now. Devrari, the son of a retired Army personnel, went to school at Pantnagar in Udham Singh Nagar, where his family — father, mother and a younger brother — lives. After graduation at the Sushila Tiwari Medical College in Haldwani, he moved to Bengaluru for post graduation and got his PhD in microbiology from Manipal University in 2018. He worked at the Ram Murti Hospital in Bareilly for two years, after which he was posted at Almora Medical College. Initially, he said, his family was worried about the work he was taking on. He added, “They were concerned about my well-being but my father explained to them that my job is a social responsibility — I could not turn my back on people."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/lone-man-in-almora-testing-covid-samples-for-16-hrs-a-day-6-months-without-break/articleshow/82235213.cms||---

Kumar was working at the Dheenampalayam shop and was staying with his colleague N Nandhakumar, 40, of Manapparai, in a room behind a chicken shop owned by Senthilkumar at Onapalayam. “A few weeks ago, Kumar began to work for Senthilkumar’s business rival Mani, who opened a salon at Avarampalayam. But he did not inform Senthilkumar about the new job. Senthilkumar, who came to know about it, asked Kumar to meet him at the chicken shop on April 10. He rebuked Kumar for abandoning the job. Following an altercation, Senthilkumar and Nandhakumar beat Kumar to death,” a police officer said. “With the help of S Arulprakash, 33, of Uliyampalayam and P Kapildev, 31, of Kalikkanaickenpalayam, who were working at the chicken shop, they took the body in a car and buried it near a stream at Onapalayam,” the officer added.The incident came to light on Saturday after Senthilkumar surrendered before the village administrative officer and confessed to the crime.

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand:1 lakh Covid kits held up as workers remove Trivendra Singh Rawat's photo||DEHRADUN: For days, the Covid-19 home isolation kit which contains medication for the viral disease has not been reaching thousands of patients in Dehradun. The reason — 20-30 anganwadi workers have been marching into the office of the chief medical officer every day with one task at hand, removing the image of former chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat from the kits. Trivendra had on March 9 stepped down as chief minister of Uttarakhand, after which Tirath Singh Rawat took over. The boxes were put together when he was in power. On the left side of the cover of each box is Trivendra’s image, with his name and “CM, Uttarakhand” written below. Besides medicines, each kit also has masks, sanitiser and gloves. Now, 1 lakh of these kits are being hastily refurbished.  “We were asked to swing into action and do something about it. Getting new boxes for 1 lakh kits was difficult because cases have been rising in Dehradun. So, it was decided that stickers laying out the Covid-19 safety protocol would be pasted on top of Trivendra Rawat’s image to hide it,” a senior health official said. “The new boxes have CM Tirath Singh Rawat’s image on them.” As of Saturday, with over 11,500 active cases, Dehradun accounts for about 35% of the state’s Covid-19 cases. While the CMO could not be reached, director general (health) Dr Tripti Bahuguna told TOI that there had been “no delay” in the delivery of home isolation kits. “I will inquire if there has been a delay in some cases,” she added. Those having to do this work, too, were unhappy. Rekha Negi, head of the Anganwadi Association in Uttarakhand, said, “They deployed us to prepare these kits when Trivendra was in power. Now, they have put us to work to remove his photo.” She added, “We were hired to take care of pregnant women and newborns, not to remove and paste stickers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/1-lakh-covid-kits-held-up-as-workers-remove-trivendras-photo/articleshow/82235218.cms||Ishita Mishra

Earlier in the week, officials from the Kadayampatti primary health centre and the health department swooped down on the tiny village to collect swab samples from all residents. They also conducted a fever camp. After 24 villagers tested Covid positive, the officials declared the village a containment zone. “We have blocked all roads to other villages, so that no one can enter or leave for two weeks,” said Dr Sadhu Bakatha Singh from the health centre. “Revenue department officials are delivering groceries and vegetables to houses there,” he told TOI.Most of the men in the village are employed in jewellery units in Bengaluru, engaged in diamond cutting and polishing. Trouble began last week when four residents, who returned from Bengaluru, visited the primary health centre complaining of fever and other Covid-19 symptoms.“After they tested positive, we traced their contacts and tested them. Another 10 people tested positive,” the doctor said.The officials conducted a fever camp and tested all residents and found 10 more people Covid positive. “All of them are stable.

---||Coimbatore||Remand prisoner seeks surgery or mercy killing||A 34-year-old remand prisoner staged a dharna in front of the Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College in Salem, demanding doctors to perform a surgery to rectify his kidney-related problem immediately. He also sought to subject him for mercy killing, as the pain was unbearable.According to a police source, S Ganapathy, a resident of Vellore district, was lodged in Salem Central Prison in connection with the murder of his mother-in-law in 2019. He has been undergoing treatment at the government hospital for a kidney-related disease. While the judicial magistrate had granted him bail, none of his friends and relatives had come forward to provide surety and take him out of the jail.Prison superintendent T Tamilselvan said, “Due to the difficulties in passing urine, Ganapathy had been using urinary catheter and undergoing treatment ever since he was lodged in the prison. About six months ago, he had refused to undergo a surgery in the government hospital to rectify his problem. He said he would undergo the surgery only in a private hospital. Now, amid the spike in Covid-19 cases, he wants to undergo the surgery.”On Saturday morning, Ganapathy was taken to the government hospital after he complained of some irritation while urinating. Doctors, the source said, advised him to visit the hospital after a few weeks. “However, Ganapathy demanded the doctors to perform the surgery immediately. As the Covid-19 cases are increasing in the district, doctors have been performing only the surgeries that are emergency in nature. So, they refused to accept his demand.”Suddenly, Ganapathy sat in front of the emergency ward of the hospital and refused to return to the person. He pleaded with the officials to take steps to perform the surgery immediately or kill him on compassionate grounds. However, officials pacified him and took him back to the prison. Tamilselvan said, “Ganapathy’s health condition is good and stable.”Meanwhile, the resident medical officer with the government hospital, Rani, refused to comment on the issue, stating medical details of a remand prison could not be shared.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/remand-prisoner-seeks-surgery-or-mercy-killing/articleshow/82235805.cms||---

He said the students were often forced to use the washrooms in the nearby buildings, as water was not supplied to the ones in the college regularly. “Similarly, only one of the five drinking water taps is functioning on the college premises. Aren’t drinking water and toilet facilities basic needs to the students,” he asked.Refuting the allegations, the college authorities said they had been taking all the efforts to provide basic amenities to the students. “Presently, renovation work is also going on at the college,” they said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/ensure-basic-amenities-at-govt-college/articleshow/82235808.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai Police discontinue sticker rule but will keep check on unwanted travel||MUMBAI: Within a week of colour coded stickers being made mandatory for all vehicles moving out for essential travel, the directive was discontinued by the Mumbai police on Saturday. The police tweeted that checks would go on to ensure that citizens complied with lockdown rules and non-essential movement was avoided. Motorists and transport activists said that although the intention behind the stickers’ directive was noble, implementation was bound to be a problem right since its inception. TimesViewThe Mumbai police’s directive to have colour coded stickers on vehicles was not backed with sufficient planning. Police stations that were supposed to stock up on sufficient stickers for distribution could not do so with stationery shops being shut. The directive ended up delaying motorists and leading to snarl-ups. It is a good thing that the decision was rolled back promptly within a week, rather than inconvenience citizens further.The police’s objective was to ensure smooth passage to emergency vehicles like those carrying medical equipment or patients. “It was necessary for stickers to be issued by authorities such as the cops, BMC or RTOs but the purpose was defeated when the police said anyone could put up stickers. When people start putting up stickers, it is impossible to check how many of them are genuinely essential workers. Lack of a holistic approach was the problem,” said activist AV Shenoy. Activists also said the directive put unnecessary burden on the already stretched police force. Nakabandis put up for checking the stickers were leading to congestion. “Most motorists were confused as to which sticker was to be affixed and where to procure it from as stationery shops are shut,” said Naraayan Kannan, a regular commuter. Some opportunists made money out of the police directive by selling each sticker for upwards of Rs 50. Lawyer Armin Wandrewala, who had dashed off a letter to police commissioner Hemant Nagrale soon after he announced the sticker directive, said it was plain impractical. “If I'm heading to the pharmacy to buy medicines, then purchasing some groceries before going to my office, should I be affixing all three stickers on my vehicle?,” she said, adding that the other problem was visibility issue as the sticker was to be affixed on the windscreen. On Friday, the last day of the sticker drive, 60 cases were made against motorists whose vehicles sported no sticker and 34 cases were made against those who intentionally sported wrong stickers. “The directive was discontinued as it was prone to misuse and was creating confusion among motorists,” said a senior police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-police-discontinue-emergency-sticker-rule-but-will-keep-check-on-unwanted-travel/articleshow/82236451.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Lucknow||King George’s Medical University loses three doyens to Covid||LUCKNOW: In a huge loss to medical fraternity, three senior doctors associated with the King George’s Medical University (KGMU) succumbed to Covid-19 on Saturday. A pall of gloom descended on KGMU soon after the news of the demise of three doctors – dean of dental department, Prof Anil Chandra, endocrinologist and former head of KGMU’s surgery department, Dr KD Verma, and former HoD, pathology, Dr Raj Mehrotra – spread on the campus. Prof Chandra, 61, was admitted to KGMU’s Covid ward 10 days ago. Though he recently tested negative but post-Covid complications claimed his life. “Both he and I had tested negative but complications took him away from us,” Prof Chandra’s wife told TOI over the phone. “He was a very humble and genuine human being. Simple to the core. I would put a lot of responsibility on his shoulders which he would carry out with ease. If I was tough on students, he would often plead their case with me and he knew I would listen to him. We shared a great professional and personal bond. The department and I will miss him badly,” said Prof AP Tikku, former dean of dental sciences and head of conservative dentistry and endodontics department. “He was my colleague for over 40 years, my junior and second in command in the department. It is a tremendous loss,” he added. Prof Chandra had completed his BDS from KGMU and after years of teaching and practising at the university, he became the dean of dental department in 2019. Former head of KGMU’s pathology department, Dr Raj Mehrotra, was another doctor to pass away on Saturday. He, along with his wife Dr Anita and son Rajat Mehrota, had also tested Covid-19 positive and were recuperating at KGMU. The family said he died of post-Covid complications. “He was tested positive on April 13 and his oxygen level was low. Since there were no beds available for him in Lucknow, we took him to Delhi after his daughter arranged for a bed there. Upon reaching Delhi after an eight-hour long journey by an oxygen-supported ambulance, he became restless and wanted to return to Lucknow. Somehow, a bed was arranged at KGMU and he was admitted to ICU but he could not be saved,” a family member told TOI. “I knew Dr Raj since 1982. He was my teacher when I was doing MD. He was a lively and gentle person and was connected well with his students who were very fond of him,” said the head of KGMU’s microbiology department Prof Amita Jain. “I had a close association with him and his family. His father Dr RML Mehrotra was also my teacher and his younger brother was my batchmate. I always knew that if I needed help, he would be there. We respected each other,” she added. Former head of surgery department at KGMU, endocrinologist Dr KD Verma (82) also succumbed to Covid-19 on Saturday. “He was a visionary who taught us how a teacher should really be. He had the vision of creating a separate endocrine surgery department out of surgery department back in 1968. He was among the first ones to bring nuclear medicine to Lucknow from Germany,” said head of KGMU’s general surgery department Prof Abhinav Sonkar. “I last met him in March and he was fit. I knew him since 1987 when I was a student. He would frequently call me up to enquire how I was doing,” he added. Dr Verma was the elder brother of former Lucknow University vice-chancellor Prof Roop Rekha Verma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kgmu-loses-three-doyens-to-covid/articleshow/82236417.cms||Yusra Husain

---||Coimbatore||Rock art with links to Indus Valley found in Tamil Nadu||COIMBATORE: A group of researchers recently discovered rock art at Nari Kugai at Melumalai in Krishnagiri district, which they believe have links to the Indus Valley civilisation. Researchers K Kumaran, Sadahnandam Krishnakumar and Pragash had chanced upon the paintings consisting of geometrical shapes, a ladder and dancing human figures while looking for cave paintings suspected to be in the area. Trichy-based archaeo-symbolist T L Subash Chandira Bose, author of ‘Ancient Thamizh- the Faculty of Harappan Symbols and Scripts’, said the symbols and letters are identical to those incised on Indus Valley seals, which were used between 3,500BC and 1,500BC. “The ancient artists used white colour and that’s why we dated it back to 4,000 years. The pictograph might play an important role in finding a relationship between the Indus Valley civilization and Tamil Nadu,” he told TOI. “The pictograph is about cosmology. A square with eight lines in it represents God, the ladder represents path and a man with a hand on his hip and another pointing towards the sky represent the universe. If we read it together, it will convey a message God is everywhere. Similarly, the image of two men with hands on their hips and another pointing towards each other are dancing figures. A circle with four lines in it represents awakening,” Bose said. The rock art reflects the ancient Tamil civilization and should be preserved and declared a protected monument, said Kumaran. However, T Satyamurthy, former superintending archaeologist of Archaeological Survey of India, refuted the claims. “The art could not be older than 2,500 years as it belongs to the metal age, mostly the iron age. The paintings are made using gypsum clay. Several such painting are found in Krishnagiri district. Tribals in the region continue the traditional of painting in caves and we had even found modern arts,” he said. “These are graffitis and not a script. One of them was found on potteries and the other two are a bit developed. It is common throughout the sub-continent.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/rock-art-with-link-to-indus-valley-found/articleshow/82235800.cms||Nivedha Selvam

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Fake call centre duping American nationals busted||Mumbai: Ten people who have been running a setup under the guise of a call centre were arrested on Saturday for having recruited youngsters to dupe scores of American nationals over the phone. The financial extent of the fraud is yet to be ascertained and more arrests are likely. The accused have been operating the centre for the past two months at Andheri and have 115 employees on their payroll, said the police, indicating the magnitude of the fraud. “We carried out a raid at Mehta Estate on Andheri-Kurla Road,” said DCP Maheshwar Reddy. Each employee, trained to speak with an American accent by the owners, was given a list of phone numbers of American nationals and called them over the internet. “The caller would convince the target that his e-commerce account had been hacked and purchases made. The victim was told that he would have to pay the bill unless he could prove that he was based in a city different from the hacker’s location. To do so, the target had to go over to the nearest retail store and purchase gift cards with a receipt. The caller would then cajole the target into sharing the gift card details including the PIN,” said an officer. An alternative modus operandi involved the callers posing as software experts. They called and offered to clean the target’s home computer that had been supposedly infected with malware if the latter agreed to buy gift cards and share their details. “The gift card details were shared by the call centre owners with an associate from Delhi. We are tracking down the aide who has been encashing the gift cards. The money involved in the fraud is yet to be evaluated,” said the officer. The fake call centre, called Broadminds IT Solutions, was being run without the required paperwork and permissions. The premises had been rented for Rs 4 lakh. Police seized 83 hard discs, 109 phones and three registers. Previously, the gang operated a similar setup at Malad. Those arrested included owners Tapesh Gupta, Nasir Gori, Ghanshyam Modi and Mohammad Ali Marzuki, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fake-call-centre-duping-american-nationals-busted/articleshow/82237546.cms||Nitasha Natu

Most of the banned outfits have been fighting against the extremisms in that country. The government, however, has failed to ban the Sinhala outfits,” he said.The Lankan government had on Saturday arrested MP Rishad Bathiudeen, leader of the All Ceylon Makkal Party, for allegedly harbouring a few Muslim outfit members, who were involved in Easter Sunday attacks.Jawahirullah said the Easter Sunday attacks might have been plotted and executed with the help of hired goons for political gains. “The Lankan government has failed to trace the real accused. The banned Muslim outfits were not having any links with the attacks. Rishad Bathiudeen was wrongly framed by police. I condemn the Lankan government for the arrest of the MP and ban on the Muslim outfits.”Referring to the Tamils residing in the east province area of Lanka, he said Mahinda Rajapaksa-led government had acquired their land forcibly. “The Sri Lankan forest department has also been trying to grab Tamil farmers’ land.”He also called on the Union and state governments to condemn the Sri Lankan government for functioning against the minorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/manithaneya-makkal-katchi-condemns-lankan-govt-for-banning-muslim-outfits/articleshow/82235814.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Tiger safaris closed for second time in 2 years||JAIPUR: The rising number of Covid cases and curbs has affected wildlife tourism industry for the second time during the peak season for two years in a row. The stakeholders faced a jolt this season too after the forest department issued an order to close the tiger reserves in the state — Sariska and Ranthambore — for tourists till May 2. The state government had announced safari restrictions in protected areas including Jhalana leopard reserve owing to the spread of Covid cases. Ranthambhore Nature Guide Association president Mohammad Rafeeq said, “Safaris were 90% booked during this period. The industry is bearing the brunt and we are hoping for normal to return.” The forest department claimed that the state government would make a refund to tourists who had deposited the ticket amount in advance to book safaris. Chief wildlife warden ML Meena said, “The amount is directly deposited in the state treasury. We will send a record of the bookings soon to the government for returning the amount.” Many alleged that tourists whose booking were cancelled between March 18 and June 30 last year are still waiting for the refunds. Federation of Hospitality and Tourism of Rajasthan (FHTR) vice-president Balendu Singh said, “Many tourists and hoteliers are awaiting for their booking refunds. The state government should expedite the process as tourism sector is facing headwinds.” An official source at forest department said refund amount of 2020 was approximately Rs 4.50 crore and an option was also provided to tourists to extend the safari on further dates till June 30, 2022. The state gave the window to visit for the safari on any date till June 30, 2022, but very few had opted for the alternative as planning a vacation in advance is quite uncertain. A hotel owner at Sariska said, “The tourists should be given this option whether they want to return or not and government should not force them to come back like this by confiscating their money. It should maintain its goodwill and credibility and return all dues at the earliest.” Tourists who want to hire a gypsy in Ranthambore Tiger Reserve and Sariska have to pay a fee of Rs 1,075 and Rs 840 per person, respectively. In Ranthambore, there is also a special entry fee for half-day/full day for hiring a gypsy. For Indian tourists, the cost of gypsy for the entire day is Rs 39,930 per vehicle and for foreign tourists it is Rs 53,240. Similarly, Gypsy fee for half-day is Rs 19,965 for Indian tourists and Rs 26,620 for foreign tourists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/tiger-safaris-closed-for-second-time-in-2-years/articleshow/82235815.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Builders seek extension of a year to complete projects||Jaipur: The completion of nearly 500 real estate projects is expected to take longer as developers in the state registered with Real Estate Regulatory Authority have sought an extension of another year. After the first lockdown last year, the developers in May 2020 were provided one year extension to complete their projects. However, as the deadline is approaching closer, the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (CREDAI), Rajasthan, has written a letter to RERA chairman requesting for an extension. A copy of the letter with TOI reads, “RERA should declare period upto 31.12.2021 as period of Force Majeure and no liabilities/responsibilities/penalties under the Act may be attracted either towards the allottees or authority, for the said duration, thereby providing complete relief to the projects. This period may be reviewed on December 31, 2021 looking at the position of economy and pandemic on that date and may be extended if required.” The developers further demanded automatic extension of end date by one year without filling the extension form. “The deadline of projects whose completion falls on March 1 should automatically be extended by RERA by a period of one year. We have requested that the promoters must not be required to file for extension and end dates should be extend by the authority universally. Penalties should be waived off as the authority has such power under rule 7 of the Rajasthan Real Estate (Regulation and development) Rules 2017,” said a CREDAI member. The developer reasoned, installments have been deferred by the government for a very long period which has resulted in poor recovery and reduced revenue collection. Many believe the recent spike in Covid-19 cases in the state might hamper the recovery in the real estate sector witnessed in the last six months. “The vicious cycle of recession may impact our economy adversely, including reduction in demand, production, employment, income, difficulty for allottee in making payment of EMI, reduction in buying capacity, reduction in prices of property and frequent cancellations. This shall lead to an impact of non-availability of all resources for 1-2 years post the situation settles,” said a developer Around 1,498 developers across the state have registered with RERA. Of them, around 500 projects have reached the deadline stage. An official source at RERA said, “It is early to comment that extension will be provided or not. A decision will be taken after having deliberations with all the stakeholders.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/builders-seek-extension-of-a-year-to-complete-projects/articleshow/82235811.cms||---

Vadaj police inspector V R Chavda said the accused, who is 20, has been arrested. The complaint was filed on Friday. The complainant has stated that on Thursday her daughter, as usual, went to the neighbouring block where her maternal uncle stays. In that block, she also has a friend with whom she regularly plays. The complainant said the accused, who lives on the 10th floor of that block, came to the 11th floor where the children were playing. He had been invited to a birthday party on the 11th floor by one of the residents. According to the complaint, the accused took the 12-year-old in his arms and then led the girl to the terrace of the building and raped her. When she began shouting in agony and horror, he covered her mouth to muffle her cries. He then threatened to kill her if she complained. When she got home, she couldn’t stop crying. Her mother spoke to her and eventually learned of her ordeal. Police registered a case of rape under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code. The cops have also invoked Section 376 (3), relating to an offender who: “…commits rape on a woman under sixteen years of age”. The section says, that such offenders “shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than twenty years, but which may extend to imprisonment for life…”. The accused has been also been charged under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.

He said, stocks were being replenished from Bokaro and few other plants and the government will ensure nobody suffers due to oxygen shortage. The Indian Air Force is also helping in transfer of oxygen to Uttar Pradesh. Additional chief secretary (information) Navneet Sehgal said, IAF aircraft are carrying empty oxygen tankers to production sites, while these are filled and brought back by train. “The CM said, it was essential to maintain a balance between demand and supply and an oxygen audit will help ascertain this. To raise availability, MSMEs involved in oxygen production or refilling cylinders have been directly linked to hospitals,” said the spokesperson. The Oxygen Express reached Lucknow from Bokaro on Saturday and more supply is on the way from Modinagar, Kashipur, Panipat and Roorkee. Yogi said, oxygen should be made available in small districts like Bahraich and Firozabad and tankers are being dispatched to send oxygen to Gorakhpur and Bareilly. On Saturday, the state received a fresh stock of 18,000 Remdesivir vials and more is on the way, the spokesperson said. “This stock has been procured from Cadila and more consignments are expected soon. Based on the demand for medicine, the government will place orders with drug manufacturers. The CM said, other than acquiring the drug, it is also necessary to ensure distribution,” the spokesperson said. Two Covid hospitals being constructed by DRDO in Lucknow and Varanasi are almost complete and the CM has asked the health department to ensure there’s sufficient manpower and facilities in these facilities. Yogi also directed hospitals to make public details of bed availability. “Twice each day, Covid care hospitals should compile data on bed availability and make it public. This information should also be uploaded at Integrated Command and Control portal,” Yogi said. Sehgal said NSA and Gangstaer Act will be slapped on persons spreading fake news on social media to create an atmosphere of fear.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/o2-audit-system-to-balance-demand-supply-cm-yogi/articleshow/82236473.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Some even said that they would look for a job here instead of returning to their previous workplace. They even said they wouldn’t mind working in development works at their gram panchayats or work under MGNREGA. The inflow of labourers and workers in the state has also led to an increase in the demand for NREGA work from nearly 10 lakh workers per day about two weeks ago to nearly 23 lakh on April 23. Daluram (42), who used to work in a canteen as a cook in Rajkot, returned to his home at Jharoli village in Gogunda tehsil in Udaipur district on April 10, after night curfew was imposed in 20 cities of Gujarat. “I used to earn around Rs 500 per day. There is no plan of returning to Rajkot. I’ll look for a job here and settle down here. While returning, the contractor gave us Rs1,000, that’s it. We are just sitting idle and the savings are getting exhausted,” he said. “I wouldn’t mind working under NREGA, but, we have been told, there’s no work in our panchayat. I am the only earning member in the family,” added Daluram, who has four daughters and a son. They are all studying in school, he said. Daluram further said, “This is the second time I have returned from Rajkot. Last year too, I had to return home after I lost my job during the national lockdown (May last year). I even registered a complaint against my previous employer for sacking me. But, nothing happened after that.” Another worker, Devi Lal, who returned to Jaswantgarh village (Udaipur district) from Gujarat, said, “I used to work at a hostel in Rajkot. I returned after the hostel shutdown due to surge in cases. I will not return there in near future.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/workers-return-from-maha-gujarat-desperate-for-jobs/articleshow/82235817.cms||---

Gradually, the situation at the crematoriums is improving,” said Bachkaniwala. The industrialists are offering technical support to solve the maintenance issues at the crematoriums. “The industrialists are not only provided material to help run the furnaces but are also helping in repairing it by sending their technicians.

Acting on a tip-off to additional commissioner of police (crime) Ashok Morale, a police team led by inspector Mahendra Jagtap from the crime branch (Unit II) first took Nikita Tale (25) from Bhosari into custody after a decoy customer confirmed that she was selling remdesivir. The police recovered the remdesivir vial, some cash and cellphone, collectively valued at Rs8,000, from her. Tale’s questioning led to the arrest of her three accomplices Rahul Walunj (22) and Rohan Walunj (20) from Chinchwad, and Pratik Bhor (25) from Mumbai. The custody of the suspects was later transferred to the Khadki police. The crime branch in a statement issued on Saturday said the four suspects knew each other and did not have legal permission to sell remdesivir, each vial priced at Rs3,490. They had illegally procured the vial without seeking prescription from a doctor and failed to produce Covid-19 report, the statement read. Assistant inspector Prakash More from the Khadki police said on Saturday, “The suspects during questioning admitted that they sold remdesivir vials earlier also for getting fast money. We are questioning them to trace the source from where they procured the injection.” An FIR related to cheating was registered by the FDA inspector, Jayashree P, under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and other laws.

E-shakhas have become the medium through which the organization is involving women to make them feel positive and stay upbeat. Sessions like ‘Corona kaal aur aadhyatm’ (Corona times and spirituality), ‘Corona aur online shiksha ka mahatv’ (Corona and relevance of online education) and ‘Corona mein lockdown ke laabh aur haani’ (Benefits and harms of lockdown during corona period) are coming handy in keeping the routine life interesting for its women members and others who are joining the group. “The biggest challenge is to keep women involved in these online sessions since no physical meetings are taking place. We hold games to make shakhas interesting,” said Shukla. Online sessions also provide knowledge on health tips during the pandemic. This is the time when women wing of the sangh wants to reach out to more and more people so that it can help the needy. One of the major reasons for not suspending the shakhas and hold them online is to not break the communication among members who are the organization’s link with the society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/online-motivation-talk-on-covid-by-rss-women-unit/articleshow/82236499.cms||Neha Shukla

Hundreds of citizens returned to Dungarpur and Banswara in the last month-and-a-half from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka due to surge in cases in other states. Now, they are forced to return since there is no work in their hometowns. CMHO Rajesh Sharma said they had set up a separate test cell considering their numbers and safety. “The citizens returning are looking for a negative test report. They are different from those going for the test due to illness or suspicion of infection. So, the risk of them contracting the infection becomes higher coming to general test centres,” said Sharma. The locals returned from other states during Holi. The surge in cases in March and April forced them to start heading for their native state. Since the fear of lockdown has been minimised, they would like to return as soon as possible so that the vacancies were not filled. Krashna Rajsingh, a social activist based in Dungarpur, said they were ready to risk their lives, but not to lose their livelihood. “The number is less but it will eventually increase in the coming days and time. Yes, they are ready to travel in midst of the second wave as they were being called by the industry and factory owners,” said Rajsingh. A local, who is planning to leave for Rajkot to work in a cutting appliances company said, “My city doesn’t offer any work to support my family. I know the risk involved, but it is worth taking it as on a daily basis we are losing Rs 300-500 income.” Since the local administration is not maintaining any data on the number of people coming and leaving, the exact figures of those who have already left is not known.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/separate-test-for-labourers-going-back-to-other-states/articleshow/82235820.cms||---

Being a long-haul destination, with few daily flights, air fares to US are the steepest now. For travel on Saturday night, the cheapest one-way fare for a Delhi-NYC flight began at Rs 7.20 lakh on online travel portals. It was on a 27-hour Air India-United Airlines code share flight via Tokyo; Mumbai-NYC one-way was cheaper at Rs 1.50 lakh. For travel from Mumbai and Delhi for the next six days, average one-way fares started at over Rs 1.20 lakh, for flights between 20-40 hours the cheapest ones with impractical flying time and transit stops. On Thursday, United had temporarily suspended its Delhi flights to Newark, San Francisco and Chicago scheduled on April 22, 23 and 24, but on Saturday it announced that it would resume the flights from Sunday. The move did not cool fares out of Delhi though. A look at tickets available for sale on flights out of Mumbai and Delhi to New York and San Francisco show that there are few seats left on direct flights. Among options available are code-share flights that transit via Tokyo, Paris, Amsterdam, London and Doha. Fares are stable on Mumbai-Newark route with the cheapest one-way fare for travel next week starting at Rs 1.30 lakh, most of them on Delta Air Lines, with a transit halt in Europe. For Delhi passengers bound to New York, the best options were for travel on April 25 and 26. The cheapest, one-way fare for Sunday was Rs 45,000, but on an impractical 40-hour Delta flight with halts in Amsterdam and Boston.For travel on Monday, the cheapest was Rs 62,000 for a 20-hour Delta flight via London. On other days, the cheapest, one-way fare on Delhi-New York flights averaged at Rs 1.25 lakh. Similarly, the cheapest fares from Mumbai/Delhi to San Francisco were available for All Nippon Airways, Asiana Airlines, and Air India at prices starting at Rs 90,000 for travel a week from now, and Rs 1.40 lakh for travel early next week. With each passing day more countries have been issuing travel bans against India. “Passengers booked to fly to US in April-May have been forced to reschedule flights and fly out before US shuts its borders to India flights,’’ said a travel agent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-those-scrambling-to-fly-to-the-us-worst-hit-with-steep-fares/articleshow/82237554.cms||---

The juveniles were detained there for various crimes and we have written to the district collector of Udaipur asking them to apprise us of the situation”, said an official of Rajasthan state commission for protection of child rights. According to the letter, the commission asked for the present situation about adherence of Covid guidelines at the centre as well as regarding the regular medical check-up of the minors. The letter also asked if the minors who tested positive had been kept in well equipped isolation ward so that the other children do not get infected. The administration has been asked to reply in seven days about setting up of Covid camp at the centre along with measures taken to prevent spread of the virus. Incidentally, the national commission for protection of child rights has also written to all the states for data about the minors who have tested positive in various shelter homes, the process for which has been started in Rajasthan. As the commission has started virtual registration of complaints till May 3, officals have asked persons to connect with them through the portal as well as the whatsapp number. However, in some cases like this one, the commission has taken cognisance of the incidents which have been reported in media and action has been taken accordingly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/panel-takes-note-of-covid-cases-in-juvenile-unit/articleshow/82235823.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Many struggle to register for Chiranjeevi scheme||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has been making appeals to people to register for the Mukhya Mantri Chiranjeevi Swasthya Bima Yojana, a universal health insurance scheme, which will provide coverage of Rs 5 lakh to each family in the state. The registration for the scheme has been opened in April and the insurance certificates will be issued from May. However, according to sources the registration for the scheme has been very low. Many people who tried to register for the scheme complained of the cumbersome procedure to get registered for the scheme. First, the family has to get a Jan Aadhaar card (a substitute of erstwhile Bhamashah card) in the name of the female head of the family. Jan Aadhaar is compulsory as the scheme is restricted to the bona fide residents of the state. But the condition of some documents like ration card, bank account proof and other documentation to get a Jan Aadhaar card makes even a computer savvy person struggling to apply for the insurance scheme. Computer literate Babulal said, “I have tried to register for a Jan Aadhaar but failed as the documentation required and process is so tedious. These days, banks do not issue pass books. What proof I will upload for account proof. Similarly, ration cards were issued a long time past and only those who use the PDS system and other NFSA beneficiaries keep these cards.” When the scheme is open to all irrespective of income, the government should give the option of some other documents like voter ID card, driving licence or passport for registration as well, he said. “It is a task to register for the scheme. First, you have to make Jan Aadhaar card by uploading the bank accounts and all other details of all members of the family. Then the next task of applying for this scheme. It is highly technical and time consuming. With e-mitras also closed due to Covid curfew, the government has to rethink the deadline of April 30,” said Mukesh Kumar. When income is no criteria for those who pay a premium from their pockets, why the income certificate is asked for and who will issue the certificate?, he asked . Medical and health secretary Siddarth Mahajan who is in the host seat in the Covid crisis said "there is nothing cumbersome for registration for the scheme. All we need only the acknowledge number of the Jan Aadhaar registration. But the number you will get only after completing the formalities of Jan Aadhar application. The scheme which will provide cashless health insurance was announced in the last budget. The scheme is free of cost to the NFSA beneficiaries and socially and economically backward classes as per the 2011 Census. It is a state specific version of the Centre's Ayushman Bharat Yojana, but in the state it is open for all. While the state government will bear the cost of premium of the poor people, others could also avail the benefit of the scheme by paying a meagre premium of Rs 850 per annum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/many-struggle-to-register-for-chiranjeevi-scheme/articleshow/82235824.cms||Joychen Joseph

The award recognises the work done in these areas for social and financial empowerment and atmanirbhar rural India. The Prime Minister also launched the distribution of e-property cards under the Swamitva Yojana across the country and digitally distributed property cards or gharauni to 57,401 villagers from 425 villages of Uttar Pradesh. The scheme has been extended to 1,409 villages in the state where genuine property owners have received titles to their property. Earlier, on October 12 last year, over 41,000 villagers from 346 villages of 37 Uttar Pradesh districts were digitally given ownership certificates in the presence of the Prime Minister. Under the Swamitva Yojana, land in rural areas is being mapped using modern technology, including drones, to demarcate land. Once ownership is settled, villagers will also be able to avail bank loans. The Swamitva Yojana was launched in 2020 as a pilot project in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, and Rajasthan. Calling it a major revolution towards rural empowerment, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said that gharauni is not just a government document, but is is also a mode of boosting the confidence of people living in villages and making them self-reliant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pm-modi-fetes-29-up-gram-panchayats-for-good-work/articleshow/82236589.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Over 50 Telangana hospitals in the ‘fire’ing line for not following norms||HYDERABAD: A day after a tragic fire accident in the ICU of a Covid-care hospital in Palghar (Maharashtra) left 15 dead, turns out over 50 hospitals in Telangana are sitting ducks for similar tragedies. In fact, during a recent inspection drive, the disaster reponse and fire services department issued notices to 38 hospitals, spread across the state, for not adhering to any fire safety norms mentioned in the rulebook. Worse, another 23 hospital buildings — the inspection revealed — are currently facing prosecution for failing to fall in line, despite repeated warnings. Incidentally, majority of these hospitals are treating Covid-19 patients. And yet, they were found to be inadequately equipped to handle fire emergencies, putting at risk the lives of patients, their attendants and even the hospital staff. But while these hopsitals have come under the radar of authorities, doctors working in state-run government hospitals claim that the number of facilities flouting fire safety norms, is much higher. “The fire NOC is usually given before issuing the building Occupancy Certificate and is renewed periodically. But not many are aware of this. Most hospitals do not even have the basic firefighting equipment ready to extinguish small fires,” said a senior doctor working at Gandhi Hospital. Fire department officials, meanwhile, maintained that they have either rejected or cancelled existing NOCs of hospitals that were found flouting norms during the inspections, conducted in the last three months. “During this period, we conducted inspections across 112 hospitals in the state and most of them were found treating Covid-19 patients. We have issued notices to some of these hospitals that did not have proper fire safety measures and cancelled NOCs of some hospitals that were flouting fire safety norms,” said C Laxmi Prasad, director, Telangana state disaster response and fire services department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/over-50-t-hospitals-in-the-fireing-line-for-not-following-norms/articleshow/82235850.cms||Moulika.KV

This is in keeping with the Covid-19 protocol of social distancing. Ourvi Uttar Pradesh Kshetra Sewa Pramukh of RSS Naval Kishore said, “Shakha is meant to inculcate in people the habit of doing things together as a community. It’s where swayamsevaks from a locality meet in small numbers for one hour daily and perform an activity together. Now, due to Covid-19 pandemic, shakhas and routine meetings take place online.” The e-shakhas have become a new medium of dialogue among swayamsevaks to draw help for people in need. The sangh has not decided to suspend the shakhas due to Covid-19 for this very reason. Sangh’s shakhas are a platform which helps its foot soldiers (swayamsevaks) maintain contact and plan their role in the society. “Each one of us has a smartphone and we connect through it to maintain a jeevant jeevan sampark (lively conversation). Ek doosre ka haal chaal poochte hain (inquire about each other),” said Sewa Pramukh, Awadh Prant, Purvi UP Kshetra, Devendra Asthana. The e-shakhas are more common in cities and especially in the ones where the Covid-19 pandemic has hit severely. The order to hold online shakhas was issued recently by the central unit of the RSS. The RSS has also started setting up isolation centres in the state. on Friday, one such centre with 50 beds was set uo in Gorakhpur’s Suhasnagar at Saraswati Shishu Mandir. “We are setting up such Covid centres almost every day and at a fast pace mainly to help those patients who have tested positive and have a big family but a small house. Such patients who have tested positive and need only isolation can be admitted in these centres,” said Kishore. Swayamsevaks provide all care and necessary things to such patients. Shakhas help to reach out to such patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rss-starts-e-shakhas-to-keep-volunteers-linked/articleshow/82236623.cms||Neha Shukla

After creating fake social media accounts of Rajkot range IG, Vadodara city police commissioner, and Gujarat CID crime head early this year, a fake Twitter account of DCP (Zone VII) Premsukh Delu has cropped up. Along with using the officer’s photograph in its display picture, the handle had also put out some controversial messages. According to the police, an FIR was lodged at Satellite police station under sections of the Information Technology (Amendment) Act after Delu submitted a complaint stating a Twitter account — @premsukhdeluips — had been created by an imposter using his name and photographs. In his complaint, the DCP stated that he got to know through various mediums and sources that a fake Twitter account in his name was operational. On checking it, he realised that the person had posted various objectionable posts that could create enmity in the society. The account was created with the intention to defame the IPS officer. The culprit had also used photographs of him in his uniform as well as other photographs. Created in December 2020, the account has 85 followers and follows 33 people. There are only two retweets — one on January 2 and second on December 28, 2020. The officer stated, “I sent a message from my official account to the fake one asking them to delete the account. I asked them how they could use my name, designation, and photographs. I asked them to delete the account or face legal action.” Satellite police began investigation but has also sought assistance from cybercrime experts to trace the place from where the account was being operated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fake-twitter-account-of-ips-officer-made/articleshow/82235275.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Negativity being spread, don’t let it overcome you: Uttar Pradesh CM||LUCKNOW: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said here on Saturday that the second wave of coronavirus was about 30 times more infectious than the first but the people shouldn't let 'fear psychosis' and 'negativity' overcome them. Countering the 'negativity' being spread through social media is also key to tackle this wave, the CM said during an interaction with senior editors on Saturday. While assuring the journalists that the suggestions made by them to improve the situation would be implemented, the CM said that the media was also required to remove fear and unnecessary negativity from the minds of public and that it was necessary to keep UP’s large population and demographic diversity in mind when assessing the situation in the state. “All necessary arrangements have been ensured by the state government for proper treatment of patients. The UP government is well-equipped in terms of beds, medicines and oxygen. The government preparation is better than before,” he said. Asking the media and the ‘enlightened class’ to play a role in identifying those who are spreading fear among people, the CM said that messages that could create panic are being circulated on social media from different accounts. “There is no shortage of drugs like Remdesivir. When the demand increased, we procured from a pharma company in Ahmedabad. This medicine is not required by all patients. The media should make people aware of this important fact,” the CM said. The CM said that arrangements had been made for oxygen plants in government institutions. Work was taking place to set up 31 new oxygen plants including 18 plants based on the latest technology provided by DRDO. He emphasised that there was no shortage of oxygen in any Covid Hospital and the actual issue was that of black marketing and hoarding which, he said, would be dealt with strictly. “We are going to conduct an oxygen audit in collaboration with IIT Kanpur, IIM Lucknow and IIT BHU for proper monitoring of oxygen. The system of live tracking of oxygen demand-supply-distribution has been implemented. There is no shortfall in oxygen supply provided only those who need it, use it. Every infected patient does not need oxygen,” the CM said. The CM claimed that there had been some initial problem in increasing beds but it had been “quickly overcome”. He said that in Lucknow alone, KGMU, Balrampur Hospital, and several private medical colleges including Era, Integral, Prasad, Hind and Mayo had been converted into dedicated Covid hospitals. Nodal officers had been appointed for every major hospital in Lucknow. The CM expressed happiness at the recovery rate in Lucknow, saying that it had increased over the past three days and that a similar trend had been observed in Prayagraj and Varanasi as well. “UP is the first state to announce free vaccination for all and nearly 8,000 centers have been set up where people above the age of 18 years will be vaccinated from May 1. Since January 16, when vaccination started, we have maintained a cold chain for vaccines and have been successful in preventing wastage,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/negativity-being-spread-dont-let-it-overcome-you-says-yogi/articleshow/82236661.cms||---

The mill’s chairman, Abhijit Patil, told TOI, “We have started the process to generate oxygen from ethanol plant and are confident that in another 10 days, our first load of 10 metric tonne of medical oxygen will be dispatched from our plant.” If successful, this process could turn Maharashtra’s sugar bowl into an oxygen bowl amid the ongoing pandemic. The ethanol plant having capacity of 60 kilo litres per day has been modified to generate 20 metric tonnes of medical grade oxygen per day by catching and processing the oxygen, which otherwise is released in atmosphere. Osmanabad district has a total daily requirement of 18 metric tonne of oxygen. The project, if successful, will meet Osmanabad district’s current requirement. “The molecule required for purifying the oxygen to medical grade has been sourced from Delhi and will reach by Monday. We are done with basic Research & Development and are confident of delivering medical oxygen ranging from 93 - 95 per cent” said Patil. Jaiprakash Dandegaonkar, the president of National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories Limited, said the decision to undertake the experiment was taken during an online meeting of sugar mill managements on Friday. “Till the time, the experiment for generating oxygen from ethanol plant gets completed, the federation has decided to purchase 700 oxygen concentrators for giving out to the needy Covid facilities,” he said. Maharashtra has 202 registered sugar factories, including 130 of them having ethanol plants. Out of these factories, 93 sugar factories are said to be open to following the suit in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/first-trial-on-to-generate-oxygen-from-ethanol-plants-in-maha/articleshow/82234262.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Indian Medical Association, Lucknow, unit head, Dr Rama Srivastava, said, “We were told 38,000 litres has arrived in Lucknow. The supplementary supply will be a lifesaver for 800-1,000 patients with critical oxygen saturation levels in Lucknow. A Covid patient with poor oxygen saturation easily consumes 50 litre of jumbo cylinder in 24 hours. More tankers are in queue to reach UP.” Talking to TOI, additional district magistrate (finance) Bipin Mishra, said, “We expect the oxygen delivered to Lucknow to last up to three-four days. The seven oxygen plants in the city will disburse the life-saving gas to government and private hospitals and individuals quarantined in their homes.” The consignment took less than half the time taken by road to reach UP, even though the railway freight service took close to 45 hours from dispatching empty tankers to Bokaro and returning with refilled ones. According to sources, the state has decided to further slash the time taken for transportation and sought help from the IAF to airdrop empty tankers in Bokaro so that refilled tankers can be sent back via train, which takes 16 hours for one-way journey.Sanjay Tripathi, divisional railway manager of Northern Railways, Lucknow division, said, “Four empty tankers left for Bokaro on Saturday morning prior arrival of refilled three tankers, including two at Lucknow and one in Varanasi. A Similarly, by evening at least four more empty tankers were being prepared to dispatch Bokaro.”“Tankers on way to Lucknow will be distribute liquid medical oxygen to city hospitals and move on to other districts,” said Roshan Jacob the district magistrate. In last 25 days, 230 tonne of oxygen was sent to UP by road from the Bokaro steel plant. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has launched a dedicated website, Oxytracker for transparent availability of oxygen to hospitals. The software's dashboard will analyse and inform if the tanker is getting delayed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/oxygen-exp-rolls-into-up-with-51000-litre-lifesaver/articleshow/82236677.cms||Arvind Chauhan

---||Kochi||Tragedy hits Thrissur Pooram on final day||THRISSUR: This year’s Thrissur Pooram, which was mired in a series of controversies right from the preparatory days, ended on a tragic note as two Pooram aficionados lost their lives and 27 people were injured when the branch of a banyan tree snapped down on the crowd during the procession on Friday midnight. Both the deceased are from Thiruvambady side. The deceased have been identified as Paniyathveettil Radhakrishnan, 65, of Punkunnam, and Ramesh, 56, of Irikkalil House at Eravimangalam. While Radhakrishnan was a celebration committee member, Ramesh was a managing committee member of Thiruvambady temple. District collector S Shanawas said some of the injured have been admitted to the Thrissur medical college hospital while the remaining are in the general hospital. The condition of none of the injured is critical. There was more panic when elephant Kuttankulangara Arjunan, which was carrying the thidambu during the event, went out of control for a brief period. But it was brought under control soon. A portion of the massive branch fell on the overhead electric and cable lines and then on to the percussion artists performing Panchavadyam. The power supply was immediately disconnected by the KSEB officials. The scale of the tragedy was reduced as only a limited number of people were permitted to participate in the festival due to the Covid-19 spread, city police commissioner Aadhithya R said. The fireworks display was officially cancelled as per the order of the district collector. However, the fireworks had to be conducted as it was a complicated process to defuse the fireworks which were arranged for display. The deputy controller of explosives of the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization (PESO) Saravanan said the filled up fireworks had to be destroyed by bursting, as it will be risky to take them back. The pakal pooram on the second day of the 30-hour cultural extravaganza was also scaled down. Paramekkavu devaswom, which had earlier paraded 15 elephants for the festival, also paraded only one elephant during the pakal pooram on Saturday morning. The Pakal Pooram events, which mark the culmination of the Pooram festivities, were advanced and wound up around 9am with the traditional ritual ‘upacharam cholli piriyal’.  The next edition of the Pooram is on May 10, 2022. Jeevan Raksha Pathak winner loses life Ramesh, who was working with the New India Assurance Company, was selected for the the President’s Jeevan Raksha Pathak Award in 1999-2000, and the award was presented to him by the then chief minister E K Nayanar, for rescuing people who had fallen into Manalippuzha river. The rescued people were returning to Thiruvananthapuram in a tempo traveller from Guruvayur after participating in the choroonu programme of the baby of their relative. The vehicle fell into the river around 2am, and Ramesh, who was riding his bike behind the vehicle immediately jumped into the river and rescued about seven or eight people. His son had come from the Gulf to participate in the Pooram this year. The other deceased, Radhakrishan, and his wife were to leave for the US after the Pooram to join his son who is working there. The son has started from the US to perform Radhakrishnan’s last rites scheduled for Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tragedy-hits-thrissur-pooram-on-final-day/articleshow/82235322.cms||T Ramavarman

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Hate’ speech CD blank, court acquits Abu Asim Azmi||MUMBAI: After the police produced a blank CD in court and a cassette that could not be played for lack of a player, a magistrate court recently acquitted Samajwadi party leader and MLA Abu Asim Azmi almost 13 years he was accused of giving a provocative speech in Hindi at Shivaji Park which allegedly “promoted feelings of enmity and hatred between Maharashtrian and Uttar Bhartiya people”.  The court also refuted the contention that he made “imputations and assertions prejudicial to national integration”. Four CDs of the alleged speech were produced in court. While one was blank, two others did not open on the laptop in court. A fourth had a clip recorded from an English news channel. “There is no instrument to play the small cassette. Thus, it creates doubt whether the speech of the accused was recorded at Shivaji Park ground on February 3, 2008, and on what basis the sanction was granted by the authority to initiate prosecution against the accused,” the court said. The court said it was further proved that the speech was a political one against Raj Thackeray and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) and it was not against people of Maharashtra. “It is further proved in their cross-examination that for application of section 117 (abetting commission of offence by the public) of Indian Penal Code, at least 10 persons should be implicated as accused and informant [cop] has not implicated 10 persons as accused while lodging FIR,” the court said. The court also questioned the week-long delay in lodging the FIR. The court said that this was neither properly explained by the informant nor the investigating officer. At the time of the FIR, the informant, a police sub-inspector, had said that on February 3, 2008, the “Desh Bachav” rally by Azmi’s party was conducted at Shivaji Park. He said that on that day, his duty was on stage, in civil clothes along with other cops. The cop further stated that Azmi and senior political leaders of the party were on stage. He further said that Azmi gave an instigating speech to create unrest among people and took political advantage of it. This was a day after the MNS leader’s speech. It was alleged that the next day, people tore down and burnt posters of MNS at Colaba and assaulted locals. The FIR said that at Ghatkopar, party workers allegedly burnt Thackeray’s effigy. The prosecution said an FIR was lodged at Shivaji Park police station on February 10, 2008 after an audio recording of the speech was verified. Azmi denied the allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hate-speech-cd-blank-court-acquits-abu-azmi/articleshow/82237564.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Officials of thr Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said these 16 oxygen generation plants would be able to generate 43 tonnes of oxygen per day and drastically cut dependence on private oxygen suppliers, saving costs in the long run. The BMC will spend around Rs 90 crore on these plants. A municipal official said the plants were likely to be set up in a month. These projects will generate oxygen at less than half the per litre cost of cylinders supplied by private parties. Once ready, these plants can be operated for a minimum of 15 years and a maximum of 30 years. Officials said that the BMC had set up an oxygen generation plant with a capacity of about 500 cubic metres per day at the Kasturba Hospital two years ago. The Trauma Care Hospital also has an oxygen generation plant with a production capacity of 1,740 cubic metres per day. Officials said that oxygen generation plants in various hospitals and Covid-19 centres would be permanent in nature and there would be no handling and filling of oxygen cylinders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-plans-16-oxygen-plants-for-rs-90-crore/articleshow/82236670.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Nashik||No progress on animal transit treatment centres||Aurangabad: Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had proposed transit treatment centres (TTCs) — for animals, birds and other creatures — in Marathwada and other places in the state in September 2020. More than six months on, the plans remain only on paper. The facilities were expected to serve as polyclinic-cum-rescue centres for different creatures that may get injured in man-animal conflicts, road-accidents, rescue operations and other mishaps. Conservationist Yadav Tarte Patil, who is a member of the State Board for Wildlife, said the TTCs for 11 forest circles in Maharashtra were announced in September 2020. “The announcement was made by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray during the maiden meeting of the reconstituted State Board for Wildlife. He sounded very keen at that time. But things have failed to move since then,” he said. Yadav said the regional forest departments should take a lead in materialising the TTCs in every circle of Maharashtra. “The necessary formalities have to be completed at the level of the regional forest offices. Therefore, the authorities concerned should be proactive to ensure that the TTCs see the light of the day,” he said. Divisional forest officer (Wildlife) Vijay Satpute said the state forest department was yet to issue further directives about setting up the TTCs. “The Covid-19 outbreak and associated issues may have been a hurdle in the way of the proposed facility. We are keen to start work on the TTC if official instructions come from the top-brass,” he said. The Gautala-Autramghat wildlife sanctuary and the Jayakwadi bird sanctuary in Aurangabad district, the peacock sanctuary in Beed district’s Naigaon and the Yedshi Ramling wildlife sanctuary in Osmanabad district are some of the major wildlife habitats in the Marathwada region, which together have a range of birds,wild animals and other creatures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/no-progress-on-animal-transit-treatment-centres/articleshow/82234269.cms||Prasad Joshi

Data on Remdesivir for children is still inconclusive. The decision to use is taken on a case to case basis,” said Dr Jayashree, chairperson Advanced Paediatrics Centre, Covid committee, PGI. Two children are on ventilator and eight on oxygen, according to PGI. Symptoms are the same as in a flu — fever, cough, cold, diarrhoea and vomiting. “Majority are coming for other treatment or disease but are turning out to be positive on pre-admission or procedure test,” said a doctor. It is tough for the doctors to manage the children as there have no clinical trials or research on Covid in children. “The treatment was tried and tested in adults. For children, it is all a hit-and-trial treatment method,” said a doctor. However, at the moment, the recovery is faster in these children, the doctor said. One of the parents of a baby admitted who is on prophylaxis hydroxychloroquine said, “I have been advised to breastfeed my baby while observing many precautions. My child had fever and diarrhoea. We took him to the hospital when his fever did not subside and he was unable to take the feed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/12-kids-fighting-covid-in-pgi-with-youngest-a-newborn/articleshow/82235879.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Rahul Kavthekar said, “My maternal uncle was being treated for Covid-19 in ward number 7. At 12.30am, the oxygen supply suddenly went off for half an hour, causing the death of two patients at night, while the third one who was critical and in the same ward died later in the morning.” Kavthekar alleged that at the time of incident, none of the doctors were available at the hospital and they came only after several calls to them. Health officials confirmed the incident about oxygen supply going off but refuted that the disruption caused the deaths of any patient. Beed’s additional civil surgeon Sukhdev Rathod said, “Ward number 7, 8 and 9 have direct connection from oxygen plant and a cylinder has also been given in ward number 7 as an alternative measure.” “We suspect that some relatives of the patients might have turned off the oxygen supply, but still we cannot say for sure that the two patients died due to non-supply of oxygen. Both the patients who died were critical — one on BiPAP and the other was on ventilator. They had RT-PCR scores of 19 and 23 respectively,” said the additional civil surgeon. Rathod said that soon after the hospital team found the supply was turned off, they immediately turned it on. Hospital authorities said that a high-level probe has been ordered into the incident and CCTV cameras installed in the ward will be checked. Beed Zilla Parishad CEO Ajit Kumbhar got policemen deployed at the hospital’s oxygen plant soon after receiving information about the oxygen supply having been disrupted for about 30 minutes in the hospital ward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/2-die-at-beed-hosp-o2-stopped-for-30mins-kin/articleshow/82234266.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Their admission will be finalised on the basis of the marks they obtain in their Class X exams. Earlier this month, CBSE cancelled the Class X board exams in the wake of the surge in Covid-19 cases. The Class X results will be prepared on the basis of an objective criterion to be developed by the Board. Any candidate who is not satisfied with the marks allocated to him/her on this basis will be given the chance to take an exam as and when the conditions are conducive to hold exams. An official at the Delhi Public School said that their online registration system is receiving a good response. “The registration process will end on June 9, following which, the students have to take an aptitude test and they will be enrolled on a provisional basis if they qualify that test. The final selection would be done on the basis of the cut-off marks fixed for each stream,” the official added. The official further said that no decision has been taken yet regarding the cut-off marks but the school will be liberal in this regard this year in view of the Covid situation. Last year, the eligibility criteria for enrolling in science was above 95% and above 90 % for commerce students. Sashank Shekhar, who is a senior teacher of Jawahar Vidya Mandir Shyamli, said, “The registration process will continue till May 31 after which an online examination will be held for taking admission in Class XI.” In its website, the school stated that it would keep a few seats reserved for those who choose to take the Class X board exam as and when it is conducted by CBSE. Sarla Birla High School has not taken a decision yet on whether to hold an aptitude test before enrolling students in Class XI on a provisional basis. Last year, the school had scrapped the aptitude test for enrolling new students due to the Covid situation. This year, according to a school official, students securing above 82% and above 75% are eligible for admission in science and commerce streams, respectively. Piyush Kumar of Guru Nanak Higher Secondary School said that the online registration for taking admission in Class XI students started a few days back. The cut-off marks for final selection have not been decided yet, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cbse-schools-begin-enrolment-of-class-xi-students-on-provisional-basis/articleshow/82235578.cms||Sanjay Sahay

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand Chief Minister launches Covid treatment circuits for Ranchi, Steel City||RANCHI: To tackle the growing crisis of beds in Ranchi and East Singhbhum, the two hotspot districts in the state with maximum surge and fatalities of Covid-19 cases daily, chief minister Hemant Soren on Saturday launched Covid circuits in these districts and said the government will roll out similar measures in other places in coming days if required. Soren launched the circuits at a ceremony held at his official residence at Kanke Road here and flagged a few ambulances on the occasion. Explaining the working of the circuits, the chief minister said, "Oxygen-supported beds are crucial for critical Covid patients. While hospitals in Ranchi and Jamshedpur are overcrowded, there are many other districts where such beds are lying vacant. Hence, we have created a corridor (circuit) linking Ranchi and Jamshedpur with other places with resources to shift the growing number of patients for timely treatment." He said six districts -- Lohardaga, Ramgarh, Khunti, Gumla, Simdega and Latehar -- are in the Ranchi circuit, two districts -- Seraikela Kharsawan and West Singhbhum are connected with Jamshedpur. “According to the circuit plan, patients from Ranchi and Jamshedpur, who are unable to get beds, will now be rushed to the nearest available hospital in any of the districts connected with the respective circuits," the chief minister said, adding, "Regulating the patient load at hospitals in these two cities is important amid the surge of Covid cases to control fatalities and properly utilise the medical resources." Sore also said, "Under the Ranchi circuit, we have 2,000 oxygen-fitted beds which 450 are vacant as of now. But hospitals in Ranchi are reeling under immense crisis. Similar is the situation in Jamshedpur." To know the status of availability of oxygen-supported beds, Soren also launched three phone numbers -- 0561-2411144 (Ranchi), 0657-2440111 (Jamshedpur) and 8987510050. “One can know the status of availability of oxygen beds by calling on these numbers and can avail the ambulance services. "Those who have vehicles can rush to the hospitals on their own. We will also ensure that people who don't have vehicles are ferried to the hospitals. All services will be free of cost,” Soren said. The chief minister assured the people that the state has enough stock of oxygen at the moment. “Let me assure you that there is no crisis of oxygen in this state. We have also increased refilling stations in recent days so that people who have cylinders can get easy access to oxygen for their patients,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hemant-launches-cov-treatment-circuits-for-ranchi-steel-city/articleshow/82235610.cms||---

This is not an isolated case, but there are many like them from as well as across the state. Around 2,000 patients from outside, mostly serious, have reach Vadodara hospitals. An analysis by officials in wake of the surge in hospitalisation in the city revealed that there were patients in the city from 26 districts of the state and six states. Amongst states other than Gujarat, most patients came from MP, Rajasthan and Maharashtra. “Have you seen queues of ambulances outside any hospital in the city? Such visuals came from all other big cities, but the doctors and hospitals in the city including both government and private doctors worked overtime as a team and coordinated well to ensure that we planned in advance to ensure we had sufficient beds. Many from MP and other places relied on Vadodara for even non-Covid treatment and they are rushing here on having Covid too,” said president of Setu, the association of private healthcare facilities in Vadodara, Dr Krutesh Shah. Sources said that the steady trickle of patients to Vadodara was also due to the non-availability of beds in other cities. Official data on Saturday evening revealed that there were 13,544 beds in Vadodara city and district including 5,817 oxygen beds and 2,463 ICU beds, 1,100 ventilator beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/huge-influx-of-patients-from-mp-rajasthan-into-vadodara-hospitals/articleshow/82234635.cms||Sachin Sharma
---||Ranchi||Liquor shops in Jharkhand seek change in fixed fee payment rule||RANCHI: Liquor sellers in Jharkhand have requested the government to collect the monthly duty based on their sales instead of charging them the fixed amount since “they are incurring losses in view of the Covid situation”. The Jharkhand Khudra Sharab Vikreta (JKSV) has written to chief minister Hemant Soren, seeking an immediate resolution to their problem. JKSV secretary Subodh Jaiswal said, “Every liquor trader generally has to pay an amount ranging from Rs 18 lakh to Rs 41 lakh as duty to the government every month. This month, too, the amount would be deducted from our accounts directly even though alcohol sales are down by 30%-15%.” Jaiswal demanded that instead of deducting a fixed amount the government should mobilise taxes according to the procurement of materials from Jharkhand State Beverage Corporation Limited. “This way the government’s revenue will not be affected and the traders can run their business properly,” he said. Even though liquor shops have been exempted from the ongoing week-long lockdown announced by the state government to contain the virus spread, the traders said that customers are not stepping out of their homes and many are even saving for exigencies in case they or their family members get infected and require hospitalisation. “These factors have led to a sharp fall in the sale of liquor,” Jaiswal said. He further said that the restrictions put on the number of attendees in weddings and allowing restaurants and hotels to stay open for home delivery only have also led to a decline in alcohol consumption. He added, “The fact that shops are closing after 8 pm is not helping business either.” Even the sale of beer, which grows exponentially during summers, is adversely affected, Jaiswal said. JKSV said that if their problems aren’t sorted out at the earliest, the shops will down their shutters soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/liquor-shops-seek-change-in-fixed-fee-payment-rule/articleshow/82235603.cms||---

Officials at the Mapusa fire and emergency services said that the fire may have been caused due to an electrical short circuit. They said that they received a call at around 11.24pm on Friday informing them of the fire. The personnel rushed to the spot, where they noticed that a live wire was hanging near the garage. The fire was doused and all the equipment inside the garage was brought out. Fire service officials said that most of the equipment was completely charred. However, the exact extent and value of loss caused to the owner is yet to be ascertained. The timely intervention of the fire officials though helped save a shop in the vicinity of the garage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mapusa-garage-gutted-loss-yet-to-be-estimated/articleshow/82235916.cms||---
---||India||Deaths among Mumbai’s 60+ less in 2nd wave: Experts||MUMBAI: In what could be the first indication of the Covid-19 vaccination drive working, some experts say deaths among the elderly have reduced in the ongoing second wave in Mumbai. London mathematician Murad Banaji has calculated that there have been 40% fewer deaths than expected among the elderly during the second wave. On Friday, Banaji tweeted: “There isn’t much good news coming out of India. Here’s some: Mumbai’s data is showing what looks like vaccines reducing fatalities.” Calling the effect significant, he said: “Deaths in the over-60s this week are around 40% less than expected based on trends up to late March and deaths in under-60s.” The timing is about right as the vaccination drive for the 60-plus started on March 1 and the “first hints” of an effect were apparent by April 8, said Banaji. Healthcare professionals, among them Dr Shashank Joshi, say they are sceptical. Dr Joshi, member of the state government task force on Covid-19, said it was too early to make correlations between the vaccination drive and deaths. At present, only 18.5 lakh of the Mumbai’s 1.4 crore population has taken at least one dose of either the Covishield or the Covaxin vaccine. Dr Gagandeep Kang from the Christian Medical College, Vellore, who has worked extensively with vaccines, said: “We will need to immunise at least 30% of people before we begin to see the effect that is driven by vaccines alone.” BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said the public health department, too, had noted a drop in deaths among the elderly. “However, we are still working out the details,” she said. While many doctors in Mumbai acknowledge that the Covid-19 vaccination has possibly reduced the severity of symptoms among people, the stark effect of vaccination as seen in countries such as Israel and the UK, where 60% and 50% of the population, respectively, has got at least the first shot, is missing. In India, only 8.3% of the population has been vaccinated so far. There is evidence trickling in from other countries that vaccinations have led to fewer hospitalisations. “The latest being the UK, which has reported 70% drop in hospitalisations,” said Dr Kang. In Israel, residents of some areas are allowed to walk out without a face mask. “The vaccines we have do work,” said Dr Kang. “When the data on positive people who do not or rarely need hospitalisation is available at scale, it will tell us that the vaccines are working.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/deaths-among-mumbais-60-less-in-2nd-wave-experts/articleshow/82237756.cms||Malathy Iyer

Till date, the authorities here have failed to provide beds as suggested by the government a month ago.Due to spike in cases, the number of active positive patients surged to 75,002 in the district on Saturday. As per guidelines issued a few times in the last one year while giving projection of cases, the government had stated 20% of total active positive patients will require beds with oxygen, in ICU and with ventilators.If this is considered, 15,000 of the 75,002 active positive patients will need beds. As per data available from the district administration, there are around 8,500 beds available in the district — a shortage of 6,500 beds.The government on March 23 had projected rise in active cases in the district to 47,707 by April 4. It had stated the district has 8,563 beds (isolation beds without O2 — 3,898, O2 beds — 2,906, beds in ICU — 1,251, beds with ventilators — 508). The number suggested was 33,395 beds (isolation beds without O2 — 23,854, O2 beds — 7,156, beds in ICU — 1,431 and beds with ventilators — 954) by April 4. The government had suggested 9,541 beds in hospitals for 20% of 47,707 active patients which is yet to be fulfilled despite rise in active cases to 75,002.The district has registered over 80 deaths in a day for the last seven consecutive days. The highest number of toll of 113 was recorded on April 19 followed by 91, 98 and 110 over the next three days.Convener of Vidarbha Hospitals Association Dr Anup Marar told TOI that lack of planning “is quite visible”. “Only crisis management is going on. Even, oxygen and medicines are not made available in sufficient quantity for existing hospitals. No new oxygen plant was erected after first surge. Now, the shortfall forecast of 6,000-plus beds is alarming. Thousands of oxygen concentrators should have been procured till now. Procrastination will lead to system collapse,” he said.Using government funds, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) had developed two Covid hospitals with 240 beds at KT Nagar and Pachpaoli a year ago but is yet to bring them into use. Covid hospitals were proposed at eight more big hospitals a week ago but has remained only on paper.The government, on April 20, projected a rise in active cases further to 1,23,680 by May 2. As such, the district is short of 10,476 beds with oxygen, 1,945 beds in ICU and 520 beds with ventilators for a total of 12,941 beds for the projected active cases. Also, the district requires to increase 32,364 more beds in CCCs.Guardian minister Nitin Raut and officials have to say that every effort is being made to increase beds in the district. “At present, the need is to ensure no shortage of oxygen and medicines which is being done at a war footing. Simultaneously, the process is going on to add more beds,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-cases-rising-but-officials-yet-to-make-provision-for-increasing-beds/articleshow/82235452.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||India||Three-day wait for Covid charters, cost up 3 times||MUMBAI: In the past two weeks, charter aircraft fitted with patient isolation pods and oxygen concentrators to fly Covid patients have been in such demand that if you book one today, your patient gets to board only after two to three days, said industry sources. “For 15 days, we reduced production at our stainless steel plant in Pithampur to provide 1,200-1,500 oxygen cylinders daily free. Yet, we could not get an air ambulance without a wait of about three days,’’ said Brijesh Agrawal, who flew his Covid positive and diabetic 83-year old grandfather from Agra to Indore this week for Rs 9 lakh. “He was in Mathura, but because Indore has better medical facilities, and our family is here too, we booked the charter,’’ he added. Others who booked charter flights for Covid patients in the past two days were charged triple the cost. A charter operator said, “A patient was charged Rs 24 lakh to fly from Indore to Chennai.” The fee charged by the doctor onboard has also gone up. “Earlier doctors charged Rs 35,000-Rs 45,000 per trip on a regular air ambulance. Now it has gone up to Rs 2-3 lakh for a Covid air ambulance charter flight,’’ said a source. Rahul Muchhal of Accretion Aviation, an aggregator, said, “We have been turning down bookings as there are no planes. The customer waits 2-3 days after booking to board a plane, but we ensure bed-to-bed transfer.” “We have had reverse movement of people moving from metros where beds and oxygen supply are in shortage to smaller cities,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/three-day-wait-for-covid-charters-cost-up-3-times/articleshow/82237762.cms||Manju V
---||Nagpur||Stop random Rem prescription, HC tells doctors||Nagpur: Concerned over shortage of essential medicines like Remdesvir, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court asked doctors, particularly private practitioners, not to indiscriminately prescribe it to Covid-19 patients. “The World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines state that this drug being not a remedy but only an investigation tool must not be injudiciously prescribed and indiscriminately used. We hope that the medical fraternity will give respect to the Maharashtra government’s standard operating procedure and WHO’s opinion,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Shreeram Modak said. During the hearing of a suo motu PIL (No 4/2020), the bench said if the medical fraternity follows SOP, it would go a long way in making the battle against this virus effective. “Their proper discretion would help in reducing demand of Remdesivir drug, which is very much required, as there’s already a shortage in production and supply.” The judges noted that medical prescription is an area which remains largely in the medical experts discretion. “We would only request all doctors and medical experts treating the Covid patients to scrupulously follow the SOP unless, in their opinion, a departure therefrom is absolutely necessary to save a patient's life.” They pointed out that since the Covid patients’ treatment is entirely in the hands of experts, there is very little that the government machinery can do, unless any irregularity is pointed out. “As long as no instance of manifest misuse of the drug is brought to notice of nodal officers and unless it’s completely in violation of mandatory SOP, the machinery wouldn’t be in a position to take any action against the concerned medical expert wrongly prescribing Remdesvir,” the bench said. The HC’s advice came after the lawyers, including amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar, expressed concern about Covid patients’ treatment protocol. They pointed out that there has been injudicious use of Remdesivir due to indiscriminate prescriptions by some doctors, not consistent with SOP prescribed by the government’s task force. Earlier, the collector informed that the liquid oxygen tankers containing 85MT, 30MT and 50MT were supplied to Nagpur on April 21, 22 and 23 from PRAX AIR HYPHEN-LINDE (Bhilai Steel Plant) and eight more tankers would be arriving from Visakhapatam soon. Don’t accept new applications without procedure: HC Justices Sunil Shukre and Shreeram Modak of the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court directed the registry not to accept and entertain any intervention application unless proper procedure has been followed. It included supplying copies along with annexures to the petitioner and all the respondents well in advance. “Although we welcome receipt of valuable information from any and every source, we wouldn’t entertain any intervention application in future, unless we’re satisfied that its contents are of real use in our fight against Covid-19. We’ve also noticed that many intervenors don’t follow the basic procedure. Now, the time has come for us to regulate such applications,” the court said. TNN Amravati commissioner, collector to inform on drugs & vaccination While adding Amravati divisional commissioner and collector as respondents, justices Sunil Shukre and Shreeram Modak of the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court told them to file affidavits on current position of Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, Favipiravir, and Ivermectin supply along with that of oxygen at all Covid care centres (CCCs) in all five districts in their division. “Both are also directed to submit their response regarding the vaccination programme. Their replies would also include details about the distribution system on supply of essential drugs and oxygen to all CCCs. So far, no information is provided on supply of lifesaving drugs and the oxygen distribution system to CCCs along with that of the vaccination programme for the entire division,” the court said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/stop-random-rem-prescription-hc-tells-doctors/articleshow/82235465.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Nagpur||Highest cases, recoveries in a day; deaths down a little||Nagpur: Covid-19 cases, constantly around 16,000 per day for the last four days, at once surged to over 17,019 on Saturday in Vidarbha, the highest-ever. On the other hand, day’s recoveries also increased to 14,366, highest-ever till date. While cases and recoveries increased, the day’s death toll reduced to 252, lowest in the last four days. The total number of cases have now reached 7.66 lakh while the number of recovered patients crossed the 6 lakh mark. The total toll is now nearing 13,000, with 4,067 reported in the 24 days of April. Even though more cases were detected, the increased recovery and decreased number of deaths could be the positive indicators for the day. The death toll from rural Vidarbha continued be a cause for concern. With 39 deaths from Nagpur city and 35 from Nagpur rural, total 82 deaths out of 252 were reported from Nagpur. Wardha reported its highest-ever – 38 deaths while Bhandara reported 23. Gondia and Chandrapur reported 21 deaths each. Not a single death was reported in Chandrapur city. All 21 deaths were reported from rural parts of the district. Yavatmal (20), Gadchiroli (16) and Amravati (14) also reported more rural deaths than those from the cities. This indicates severe spread of Covid-19 in rural areas. Another positive indicator was the number of tests done in the last 24 hours. In all, 67,457 tests were conducted in 11 districts. With Nagpur conducting the highest (25,300 tests), Yavatmal and Buldhana conducted more than 6,000 tests apiece. As the number of recovered patients is increasing daily, the recovery rate is also improving constantly. It reached 79.1% on Saturday. Still, Vidarbha’s recovery rate is less than the state and national average. The number of under-treatment patients reached 1,47,311 and is now nearing the 1.5 lakh mark. According to an estimate, it will surpass the 2 lakh mark in May. Bhandara: The number of recovered patients (1,465) was significantly higher than the number of new cases (1,372) in Bhandara where 4,906 samples were tested on Saturday. 23 deaths were reported. Now, the district has 43,953 cases, including 31,948 recoveries and 695 deaths. Total 11,310 patients are under treatment. Gondia: Recoveries were more (663) than new cases (583) in Gondia too. Day’s death toll was 21. Out of them, 13 were from Gondia and 8 from rural parts of the district. Gondia now has 29,633 total cases, including 22,642 recoveries and 454 deaths. Total 6,537 patients are under treatment. Gadchiroli: The district reported 571 new cases, 319 recoveries and 16 deaths in a day on Saturday. This took Gadchiroli’s caseload to 18,004, including 13,375 recoveries and 311 deaths. Now, 4318 paitents are undergoing treatment in the district, which is the highest-ever for Gadchiroli. Washim: 503 new cases and 379 recoveries marked Saturday for Washim. Four deaths were also reported. Now, out of 24,979 total cases, 20,388 have recovered while 258 deaths have been reported till date. Washim has 4,332 patients under treatment. Akola: With 494 new cases and 594 recoveries, Akola reported 9 deaths on Saturday. The caseload reached 37,203, including 30,271 recoveries and 619 deaths till date. Now, 6,313 patients are under treatment. Buldhana: The district reported more recoveries (1,378) against new cases (1,080) despite a good number of tests (6,769) conducted in a day. This indicates that the positivity rate is reducing in Buldhana, which is a third worst-hit district in Vidarbha after Nagpur and Amravati. Total cases reached 57,815 in Buldhana. Recoveries also reached 50409. Total 7,041 patients are still under treatment. Amravati: Fourteen deaths and a spike of 704 new cases saw the district’s toll soaring to 861 and caseload to 60,480 on Saturday. Yavatmal: The toll rose to 1,076 after 20 deaths were reported on Saturday. Out of the 6,043 reports, 1,163 were detected Covid positive. Chandrapur: Covid cases witnessed yet another surge (1,618) on Saturday. There were 21 deaths as well, taking the toll to 754. Wardha: With 38 deaths and 932 positive cases, the district recorded its highest single-day spike on Saturday. Meanwhile, 511 patients were discharged after recovery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/highest-cases-recoveries-in-a-day-deaths-down-a-little/articleshow/82235481.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Being a long-haul destination, with few daily flights, airfares to the US are the steepest now. For travel on Saturday night, the cheapest one-way fare for a Delhi-NYC flight began at Rs 7.2 lakh on online travel portals. It was on a 27-hour Air India-United Airlines code share flight via Tokyo; Mumbai-NYC one-way was cheaper at Rs 1.5 lakh. For travel from Mumbai and Delhi for the next six days, average one-way fares started at over Rs 1.2 lakh, for flights between 20-40 hours the cheapest ones with impractical flying time and transit stops. A look at tickets available for sale on flights out of Mumbai and Delhi to New York and San Francisco show that there are few seats left on direct flights.

---||India||Covid-19: From giants to startups, firms get into the O2 act||NEW DELHI: A host of companies, ranging from cigarettes to consumer goods company ITC, salt-to-software conglomerate Tata Group, and logistics startup Delhivery have joined efforts to ensure increased oxygen supply to Covid-19 patients. Besides, fertiliser producer IFFCO, crop-protection company UPL and even smaller companies announced fresh measures to augment supplies during what is seen as an emergency. ITC said it has tied up with oxygen supplier Linde India to airfreight 24 cryogenic ISO containers of 20 tons each from Asian countries to transport medical oxygen across India. ITC is also airlifting large numbers of oxygen concentrators for distribution with its paperboards unit in Bhadrachalam commencing the supply of oxygen to neighbouring areas. Separately, Linde said it had secured 24 cryogenic containers in collaboration with the Tata Group which have arrived in eastern India, which is currently surplus in oxygen and helping bridge some of the deficit in North India. Even Delhivery is flying charters to ship concentrators and other essential supplies into the country, the startup said. Similarly, Sequoia Capital managing director Shailendra J Singh tweeted that the firm was scouting for oxygen concentrators. “We got a few dozen leads that we are pursuing now, including some amazing referrals from our friends in Sequoia China,” he said in a social media post later in the day. Manufacturing units too are repurposing some of their plants to produce oxygen or setting up new units. For instance, UPL said it plans to convert four of its nitrogen production plants in Gujarat to produce and deliver oxygen to four hospitals in Gujarat and MP. “These plants will then be skid-mounted and delivered directly to hospital sites. This innovation by UPL will help cater to 200-250 beds at each of these hospitals including ICU patients,” it said. Similarly, IFFCO is getting one of its facilities in Uttar Pradesh to produce oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/from-giants-to-startups-firms-get-into-the-o2-act/articleshow/82237777.cms||---
---||India||Maoists kill cop, the 3rd in 10 days||RAIPUR: Maoists have murdered a police officer they had abducted from his village in Bastar’s Bijapur district four days ago. SI Murli Tati, who was on medical leave, is the third off-duty cop to be killed by Maoists in less than 10 days in Bastar. Since the Maoists had held him hostage for a few days, there was hope that he would be released. But his body was found on the outskirts of a village, not far from his own, early on Saturday. A note left on his body said the decision to murder him had been taken at a ‘jan adalat’ because he had ‘dared to join the forces’ and had killed many PLGA cadres. Unlike the kidnapping of CoBRA commando Rakeshwar Singh Manhas, there was no public appeal from activists for Tati’s release. The officer’s wife had appealed to the Maoists to spare him, saying: “My husband’s mental state isn’t good. He left home without saying anything. I am hoping that people will help me and request Maoists to release my husband.” SI Tati was with District Reserve Guards (DRG) — a unit of local tribals that spearheads anti-Maoist operations. He had gone to his village Palnar in Gangaloor, but was kidnapped on April 21. Police said Tati had joined the force during the final days of the Salwa Judum movement in 2011. After killing 22 jawans in an ambush on April 3, Maoists have murdered over seven people, including a 15-year-old boy and three cops, in less than two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/maoists-kill-cop-the-3rd-in-10-days/articleshow/82237782.cms||---
---||Surat||No bed in their backyards, patients risk long travel for treatment||SURAT/VADODARA/AHMEDABAD: The dire shortage of beds and oxygen is forcing Covid-19 patients to risk travelling hundreds of kilometres away to save their lives. If patients from Saurashtra are going all the way up to Surat, Vadodara hospitals are seeing an influx of Covid-infected from Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Situation at Ahmedabad Civil Hospital is no different even as it’s become virtually impossible to get beds there. Saurashtra’s three biggest hospitals — the Pandit Deendayal Hospital (Rajkot civil hospital), Jamnagar’s GG Hospitals and Bhavnagar’s Sir T Hospital — are overwhelmed with patients not just from respective cities but from villages of other districts too. Patients who are being informed two or three days in advance by their doctors about possible oxygen requirements are packing their bags to Surat where several community isolation centres have been set up to reduce the pressure on government hospitals. Manju Koshiya (60) and her husband Kurji (65), both Covid-19 positive, were brought to the city from Nari village in Bhavnagar district, 354 kms away, after they could not find a hospital bed with oxygen supply. While the woman’s health is improving, her husband is still down with serious infection. Similarly, government officer Vipul Patel had to shift his both elder brothers to Surat from Rajkot for similar issues. “I inquired with my friends here and got them admitted owing to the difficulties in Rajkot. The facilities are better in Surat, at least for now,” Patel told TOI. Dr J P Modi, medical superintendent of Ahmedabad Civil Hospital — Gujarat's biggest Covid care hospital — said that they are witnessing an influx of patients both from outside the city and state. “We don’t have statistics, but several travel hundreds of kilometres in hope of getting one bed with a ventilator or BiPAP. We attempt to provide bed to all irrespective of their domicile,” he said. In Vadodara, three members of a family from Rajgadh in MP have come and one of them is in serious condition at the SSG Hospital while two others are in private hospitals. Minister of state for Narmada and urban housing Yogesh Patel said around 2,000 patients from outside the district are being treated in Vadodara. In PDU Hospital at Rajkot, there are 60-70 ambulances and private vehicles waiting for patients’ admission at any given time of the day while Jamnagar collector had made a fervent appeal to people not to bring patients to GG Hospital as they were already stretched beyond capacity. Geeta Chaklasiya (47) was brought to the city from Jalila village of Botad district two days ago. “Doctor told us to keep oxygen ready as she may need it anytime. We searched but couldn’t find any facility nearby and so we brought her to Surat,” said Naresh, her brother-in-law. Another 85-year-old patient Bhikha Chaklasiya too was brought to the city by his son Bharat, a textile businessman. There are at least 10 such centres having beds in the range of 20 to 50 that have been set up by various communities like Patidars, Jains, Marwadis, Ahir Samaj etc. Manish Kapadiya, a coordinator at an isolation centre set up by Samast Patidar Samaj, told TOI: “Relatives of patients requiring oxygen support are inquiring with Surat hospitals for vacant beds and once they get confirmation, they shift them. Many such patients are getting treatment in isolation centres here,” “Of the 40 patients admitted here, total 14 have been brought from Saurashtra. We are taking all types of care of these patients since they come from long distances and have limited local support,” said Abhin Kalathiya, a coordinator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/no-bed-in-their-backyards-patients-risk-long-travel-for-treatment/articleshow/82235021.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Vadodara||No bed in their backyards, patients risk long travel for treatment||SURAT/VADODARA/AHMEDABAD: The dire shortage of beds and oxygen is forcing Covid-19 patients to risk travelling hundreds of kilometres away to save their lives. If patients from Saurashtra are going all the way up to Surat, Vadodara hospitals are seeing an influx of Covid-infected from Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Situation at Ahmedabad Civil Hospital is no different even as it’s become virtually impossible to get beds there. Saurashtra’s three biggest hospitals — the Pandit Deendayal Hospital (Rajkot civil hospital), Jamnagar’s GG Hospitals and Bhavnagar’s Sir T Hospital — are overwhelmed with patients not just from respective cities but from villages of other districts too. Patients who are being informed two or three days in advance by their doctors about possible oxygen requirements are packing their bags to Surat where several community isolation centres have been set up to reduce the pressure on government hospitals. Manju Koshiya (60) and her husband Kurji (65), both Covid-19 positive, were brought to the city from Nari village in Bhavnagar district, 354 kms away, after they could not find a hospital bed with oxygen supply. While the woman’s health is improving, her husband is still down with serious infection. Similarly, government officer Vipul Patel had to shift his both elder brothers to Surat from Rajkot for similar issues. “I inquired with my friends here and got them admitted owing to the difficulties in Rajkot. The facilities are better in Surat, at least for now,” Patel told TOI. Dr J P Modi, medical superintendent of Ahmedabad Civil Hospital — Gujarat's biggest Covid care hospital — said that they are witnessing an influx of patients both from outside the city and state. “We don’t have statistics, but several travel hundreds of kilometres in hope of getting one bed with a ventilator or BiPAP. We attempt to provide bed to all irrespective of their domicile,” he said. In Vadodara, three members of a family from Rajgadh in MP have come and one of them is in serious condition at the SSG Hospital while two others are in private hospitals. Minister of state for Narmada and urban housing Yogesh Patel said around 2,000 patients from outside the district are being treated in Vadodara. In PDU Hospital at Rajkot, there are 60-70 ambulances and private vehicles waiting for patients’ admission at any given time of the day while Jamnagar collector had made a fervent appeal to people not to bring patients to GG Hospital as they were already stretched beyond capacity.

---||India||Tamil Nadu and Kerala have fought the Covid tsunami well so far||The tsunami of Covid cases has led to a collapse of the health system in state after state exposing the lack of preparedness. People are begging for help as they run from one hospital to another looking for a bed, oxygen, drugs, ambulances or even hearse vans. With helplines clogged, nodal officers unreachable and dashboards and apps without real time data, some are turning to social media Samaritans in desperation. Read our coronavirus live blog for all the latest news and updatesBut there are two states — Tamil Nadu and Kerala — that have not witnessed such scenes yet. Both these states seem to have learnt important lessons from the last surge and stand out for their public health approach to tackling the pandemic and preparedness in terms of putting a system in place that takes responsibility of guiding treatment once a person tests positive for Covid. Every second person getting tested in Kolkata is positiveIn contrast to other states, how different has been the approach in Tamil Nadu and Kerala? In Tamil Nadu, Chennai has the highest number of cases and 75% of Covid beds are occupied. A Covid patient wearing an oxygen mask sits at a hospital for treatment in Chennai. (ANI Photo)But instead of frantic relatives running around, the corporation has stepped in to reassure citizens that they need not approach hospitals directly. PM Modi's Mann Ki Baat address: Top quotes“Whosoever has a serious condition, they will be given first preference to get quality care and immediate treatment will be started. It is common sense. Those with mild symptoms should go to the screening centre,” explained the corporation commissioner G Prakash. He added that such a patient management system was important to avoid what was happening in other cities where people were lying on the road waiting for treatment. Similar arrangements have been made in every district in Tamil Nadu. The state government has also stocked oxygen and centrally procured all the drugs needed for treatment of Covid. These arrangements have ensured that people don’t throng hospitals in panic. It has also prevented patients in a desperate situation being looted in the name of providing ambulances, oxygen or medicines. Ambulance, screening centre services and RTPCR tests are free for patients. Covid-19 patients being treated inside the first unit of ‘Makeshift ICU’ set up at a hospital in Kozhikode. (PTI Photo)In Kerala, also a triaging system involving the public health cadre and the different tiers of the health system has been put in place along with tele-consultation facilities for patients to consult doctors without having to travel to hospitals. Barring a small percentage of walk-in patients who choose private hospitals and opt to pay for it themselves, for most, all Covid-related services are free of cost in the public health system. “We are preparing for an even bigger patient load. But no health system can go on expanding. So we are trying hard to bring the number of cases down to take the load off the system,” said Dr Mohammed Asheel, executive director of Kerala Social Security Mission even as daily Covid cases in the state have crossed 28,000 from about 14,000 a week back. By making use of the public health cadre and the different levels of treatment centres, these states have managed to minimise the load on the health system even as they get ready to face a surge. “If a patient reaches a hospital, it should be the responsibility of the hospital to find the nearest bed so that patients need to go to just one place. There is an urgent need for a properly run control room which will know the number of beds open for admission and where. What patients are being put through is shocking and unacceptable,” said Dr T Sundararaman, global health coordinator of Peoples Health Movement. Kapil Chopra of Charity Beds, which has been helping people find beds in Delhi, says the number of cases has deluged the system. “The government keeps talking of beds being available. Just go to their hospital and you will see a line of ambulances outside. People are sitting in ambulances and dying in ambulances. It is too late to talk of a system,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tamil-nadu-and-kerala-have-fought-the-covid-tsunami-well-so-far/articleshow/82237792.cms||Rema Nagarajan
---||Delhi||20 Covid patients die in Delhi hospital due to oxygen shortage||NEW DELHI: Twenty Covid patients, who had gone to Jaipur Golden Hospital in Rohini looking to get cured and survive the pandemic, ended up dead on Friday night because of shortage of oxygen. In a rare move, a desperate hospital administration went public with the news, perhaps hoping to wake up the authorities from their stupor. Dr D K Baluja, medical director of the hospital, said that of the 20 patients who died on Friday night, 19 were under critical care requiring ventilator support and high-flow oxygen administered via high-flow nasal cannula among others. "We were supposed to receive our oxygen supply at 5.30pm on Friday and had plans in place to pull through for another two to three hours. But when the oxygen supply didn't arrive for five hours, we had to use 50 big cylinders kept in reserve to continue oxygen therapy to the patients. It couldn't deliver oxygen with the required pressure, leading to the death of some of the critically ill patients," he said. "It is a combined failure of all of us. It is a catastrophic manmade disaster in a developing country." Some city hospitals ask relatives to shift patientsLives of more than 100 patients at risk. 500 cubic metres of oxygen left which will last for 45 minutes to an hour. Manual ventilation starts. Need urgent refill ASAP,” read the SOS sent out by the hospital. Such is the nerve-wracking tension being experienced by hospitals as an erratic oxygen supply keeps them on tenterhooks. Saroj Super Specialty Hospital, Rohini, which too has been facing shortage of oxygen, advised its patients to shift to other hospitals during the day. The erratic supply of oxygen has been making the doctors anxious for five days now. The problem is also causing stress and anxiety among the family members of the patients. “Why can't the government fix this problem? The deaths may be mere numbers for some but end of the world for the families,” said Ravi Prakash, whose mother is admitted here. The hospital had just five minutes of oxygen supply left at 1.30pm on Saturday. “We have received the supply and will survive till 1pm on Sunday afternoon,” said Dr PK Bhardwaj, chief executive director and head of department of surgery at the hospital. Batra Hospital in south Delhi asked the families of patients to take them home. “Can’t see them dying, and hence we are asking the attendants to take them home,” said Dr SCL Gupta, medical director, at 4pm. Dr Gupta broke down while talking about the crisis the hospital has been facing for the past two days. “Since we received the supply in the evening, we are fine for now but tomorrow is another day,” said Gupta. Shanti Mukand Hospital in Karkardooma, east Delhi, had enough oxygen only for an hour when TOI spoke to them at 8.19pm. CEO Sunil Kumar Saggar said: “We have been waiting since 5pm and were told the tanker will reach by 8pm.” Metro Hospital in Preet Vihar had started telling their patients around noon about the crisis. They received a tanker early in the morning around 5am which helped them through the day, but by 12pm on Saturday there was only some hours of supply left. “We had supply for an hour or so and raised an SOS request. We are taking no new patients who need oxygen support as it would be tough for us to manage,” said the nodal officer. Finally, they got the supply that would last till Sunday morning. At Makkar Hospital in Laxmi Nagar, the supply was over by noon. Moolchand Hospital also sent out an SOS in the morning saying it had limited supply of oxygen. Most of the hospitals have not been taking any fresh admissions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/20-covid-patients-die-in-delhi-hospital-due-to-oxygen-shortage/articleshow/82237809.cms||---

On December 8, 90-year-old British woman Margaret Keenan, resplendent in her Christmas T-shirt, received the Western world’s first vaccination — a chink of light at the end of the tunnel for humanity after a devastating pandemic year. And 137 days later, the first billion doses — both first and second shots — have been administered to a pandemic-weary world, according to AFP and Bloomberg databases. According to the tally compiled from official sources, at least 1,002,938,540 doses have been administered in 207 countries and territories — accounting for over 96% of the world with active vaccine campaigns. The unprecedented drive is seen as the world’s ticket out of the virus disaster. With new variants sparking a worrying fresh spike of cases and uncertainty over the vaccines’ effectiveness against them, the planet is now racing to inoculate as many people as possible. But it will take another 19 months to vaccinate 75% of the world’s population at the current pace of 18.5 million shots a day. More than half, or 58%, have been given in three countries: the US with 225.6 million doses, China with 216.1 million doses and India with 138.4 million.

---||Delhi||Will hang anyone stopping oxygen supply, says Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: On a day when 20 people died at Jaipur Golden Hospital because of oxygen shortage, the Delhi high court said it would “hang” anyone who tried to obstruct oxygen supply to the city that could prove fatal for patients in hospitals. When the court was informed about the oxygen supply being disrupted at the ground level, it remarked: “We are going to hang that man. It is a criminal offence. By this obstruction, people can lose lives. We are not going to spare anyone whether it is a senior officer or junior officer from Centre, state or local authority.” It added that any such instance should be brought to its notice. A few city hospitals that are facing an acute shortage of oxygen had pleaded before the court that since their supply would last only for a few hours, and in some cases only a few minutes, their stocks should be replenished. They said they had critical Covid patients in their care. The Delhi government informed the court that Delhi had received only 309 MT of oxygen as against its allocated quota of 480 MT. Ramp up infra, says HC, cites expert view peak yet to comeAppearing for the Delhi government, senior advocate Rahul Mehra explained there was a certain requirement for a certain hospital. “We (Delhi government) come in and we do pro rata basis allocation. The cause of this is that we do not have that balance (of oxygen). We can’t be oblivious to that fact that what was promised (480 MT) has not been given,” he added. Maharaja Agrasen Hospital’s counsel, Alok Kumar Aggarwal, claimed that the hospital’s name didn’t even figure on the list of those being supplied with oxygen. “We have 306 Covid patients and 106 are on ventilators right now. We have been communicating with everyone possible but to no avail,” said Aggarwal. The counsel for Batra Hospital then intervened in the proceedings saying it was treating 352 Covid patients with 33 in the ICU and 160 requiring regular oxygen supply. “Our daily requirement is eight tonnes. With six tonnes available currently, we will be able to manage but it will last only for an hour,” he said. “Citizens can’t be allowed to die like this only because 480 metric tonnes hasn’t come,” the bench of Justices Vipin Sankhi and Rekha Palli remarked. It was the perception of the Delhi government that the Centre was going to arrange everything. “We are informed that this, again, was on account of arrangements not being made for cryogenic tankers to supply oxygen to Delhi. The Delhi government should, therefore, make all-out efforts for procurement of cryogenic tankers from whatever source can be made available, and look for all possible avenues,” the court said in its order. Mehra then pointed out that since the national capital is not an industrial state, it didn’t have any cryogenic tanks. The bench, however, observed that the central government officials appearing before it had said that other states — including those which do not have their own infrastructure of cryogenic tanks for industrial use — had made arrangements. “Let the GNCTD also take steps in this regard in coordination with the sub-group formed by the ministry of road transport and highways in case the cryogenic tanks are in short supply,” it added. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta informed the high court that the central government would look into the issue so that a reasonable arrangement was worked out for making tanks available for transportation of liquid oxygen from all three plants — Durgapur, Rourkela and Kalinganagar — in coordination with the Delhi government. “We make it clear that the efforts GNCTD has to make in this regard cannot be trivialised and they should not leave it entirely to the central government to act in this regard,” the order asserted. Delhi’s persistent oxygen shortage was stated to be primarily due to the fact that it was not getting the allocated daily quota of 480 metric tonnes. Though several reasons were cited, the high court noted that one of the key factors was that the three oxygen-supplying plants were situated at Rourkela, Durgapur and Kalinganagar. For Durgapur, empty cryogenic tanks have been airlifted and were in the process of being filled with liquid oxygen. “We have also been informed that Indian Railways is waiting in readiness to transport the said tanks to Delhi as soon as the same is loaded,” said the court. Central government officials Sumita Dawra and Piyush Goyal informed the bench that the Delhi government had not made arrangements for cryogenic tanks for transporting the liquid oxygen from the plants at Rourkela and Kalinganagar. Meanwhile, intervening in the proceedings, advocate Sachin Datta, representing Jaipur Golden Hospital, urged the court to consider a probable human tragedy that was waiting to happen. “We lost 21 people at midnight. The day before we got oxygen. Yesterday we got nothing. In the meantime, AIIMS gave us 1,500 litres. We are literally gasping for oxygen. It will last for half an hour now,” he said. “We regularly tried to get in touch with the authorities. I request the high court to save hundreds of lives. This is a case where the situation is slipping out of hands.” Datta’s plea was noted by the high court, which said in the order, “The hospitals present before us are expressing their dire need for oxygen on an immediate basis since they have several patients in ICU, and their lives are at stake.” The counsels appearing for the Delhi government were directed to make note of the requirements and its nodal officer was ordered to consider all such demands made by hospitals and nursing homes while allocating oxygen received during the day. “In case any security for the hospitals/ nursing homes is sought, Delhi Police shall examine the same to prevent any untoward incident,” the high court added. The high court further directed all oxygen suppliers dealing with Delhi to provide complete details of hospitals they were catering to, the time at which they had supplied and the quantities. “The information shall be provided to the nodal officer of GNCTD, Udit Prakash Rai.” “One other aspect that we call upon both the central government and the GNCTD to also consider is further augmentation of resources, keeping in view that the experts in the field are claiming that the peak of the present wave is yet to be reached,” stated the court’s order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/will-hang-anyone-stopping-oxygen-supply-says-delhi-hc/articleshow/82237822.cms||Aamir Khan
---||Noida||Noida cremations far outstrip 'official' toll||NOIDA: Between April 1 and 23, when the official death toll inflicted by the Covid-19 pandemic stood at 137 in Gautam Budh Nagar, there were 1,185 cremations following Covid protocols at the two CNG furnaces in Antim Niwas, the crematorium's records show. The two CNG furnaces at the crematorium in Noida's Sector 94 are being used solely for Covid patients. Crematorium managers said most bodies were brought there from hospitals in Gautam Budh Nagar, and about 25% were from hospitals in neighbouring NCR districts like Ghaziabad, Bulandshahr, Meerut, Mathura, Gurgaon, Faridabad, etc. Cremation of Covid patients is being carried out using traditional ways too. This data is not captured in the number of cremations at the two CNG furnaces. Non-Covid cremations are also taking place at Antim Niwas, on the platforms meant for pyres. From April 1 to 4pm on April 23, the number of people afflicted with Covid cremated in one of the CNG furnaces at Antim Niwas was 729. In the other furnace, there were 456 cremations in the same period. "We are cremating only Covid patients in the two existing CNG furnaces. However, some Covid patients are also being cremated using traditional ways when the furnaces are occupied or the family wants to perform the rituals," an Antim Niwas official told TOI. Till about two days ago, no family was turned away, irrespective of the location of the hospital from where the bodies came. "But we are overburdened now, and families of patients being brought from other districts are being discouraged," another Antim Niwas official told TOI. Asked how the crematorium ascertains if Covid protocols are to be followed for a deceased, Mahesh Saxena of Lok Manch - the NGO which runs Antim Niwas that is owned by the Noida Authority - said they go by the Covid report and hospital documents. "The families come with the Covid reports and reports of the cause of death. At times, there are patients who tested positive before death but at the time of death, the report was negative," he said. Covid protocols are followed in such cases as well. Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that many of the deaths were being cross-notified to other districts and state surveillance officers. "In most districts, if you compare the data of deaths and the records of cremation grounds, you will find a difference," he said. "Initially, there used to be testing of bodies, but later, it was directed that all bodies should be cremated as per Covid norms and officials should not wait for the Covid report. At the cremation ground, you don't know which body falls in which category. Hospitals and laboratories are handling the data since the data has been decentralised, unlike conspiracy theories that the data may be under-reported. Further, many cases would be removed from the portal because at the time of death, the deceased became non-Covid," the DM added. Suhas admitted that there could be one category of Covid deaths that "could not be captured". "Another category can be those who came from outside the district. Those which came for tertiary care here from outside and died at a Covid hospital, that can be another category," he said. With crematoriums getting swamped, the Noida Authority has issued an order that people should use the cremation ground nearest to them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-cremations-far-outstrip-official-toll/articleshow/82237831.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||World||Asean nations demand ‘immediate cessation of violence’ in Myanmar||JAKARTA: Southeast Asian leaders demanded an immediate end to killings and the release of political detainees in Myanmar in an emergency summit with its top general and coup leader Saturday in the Indonesian capital, Indonesia’s president said. The leaders of the Asean also told Senior General Min Aung Hlaing during the two-hour talks in Jakarta that a dialogue between contending parties in Myanmar should immediately start, with help of Asean envoys, Indonesian President Widodo said. “The situation in Myanmar is unacceptable and should not continue. Violence must be stopped, democracy, stability and peace in Myanmar must be returned immediately,” Widodo said during the meeting. Daily shootings by police and soldiers since the coup have killed more than 700 mostly peaceful protesters and bystanders. A statement issued by Asean through Brunei asked for the “immediate cessation of violence in Myanmar” and urged all parties to “exercise utmost restraint”. The messages conveyed to Hlaing were unusually blunt and could be seen as a breach of the conservative 10-nation bloc’s bedrock principle forbidding member states from interfering in each other’s domestic affairs. “There is a tremendous expectation on the part of the international community on how Asean is addressing the Myanmar issue,” Malaysia PM Muhyiddin said, and added that Asean chairman, Brunei PM Hassanal Bolkiah, should be allowed access to Myanmar to meet contending parties. “We tried not to accuse his side too much,” Muhyiddin added. “We just stressed that the violence must stop. For him, it’s the other side that’s causing the problems. But he agreed that violence must stop.” “He said he (Min Aung Hlaing) heard us, he would take the point in, which he considered helpful,” Singapore PM Lee Hsien Loong told reporters.

---||Nagpur||‘Set aside funds, get health cover for med emergency’||The Covid-19 pandemic has been both emotionally and financially draining for patients and their family members. For those families, who lost their sole breadwinner, it has been particularly tough. Ashutosh Wakhare, visiting faculty at the ministry of finance’s Arun Jaitley National Institute of Financial Management and founder of Money Bee Institute Pvt Ltd, talks to TOI about how families can try to better equip themselves to face health emergencies from a financial point of view. Excerpts from an interview... Q.The second wave has been more devastating and hospital bills are skyrocketing. How can families prepare themselves in a better way? A. There’s no one size fits all formula, because ultimately it comes down to how much the person or family as a whole earns. If someone is making a couple of lakhs per month then this financial hit won’t be devastating, but for someone earning Rs 25,000 per month a prolonged stay in hospital could virtually mean bankruptcy. Regardless of your situation, there are three things which need to be done on a priority. First is to immediately arrange for Rs 2 lakh via a highly liquid asset (FD or cash ) because that’s the average bill for a week’s stay in a hospital. The moment you land in hospital there will be a demand to deposit the money. Hence, ensure that you can get access to that money within hours. Second, calculate your basic monthly expense which you will incur even if you don’t step outside your house. Now, start putting together a corpus of at least six months of such living expenses. Keep this amount also as a liquid asset so that you can access it without too much of a hassle. Third, get health insurance cover ASAP and make sure it covers Covid-19 as well. The premiums might be high right now because insurance companies are looking at high claims but still, take it. Q. Have people missed out on planning for a health emergency? A. Big time and in fact many feel that these premiums are a waste of money as ‘nothing will happen to them’. Last year, Covid-19 struck in full flow from March end and by July, health insurance policies were available in the market that specifically covered Corona. I remember purchasing policies for my entire staff and it cost roughly Rs5,000 per head. Now many who did not shell out Rs5,000 in July for the health cover, ended up paying Rs 2 lakh as hospital bills in September and October when the disease was at its peak during the first wave. Health emergencies have to be tackled with a proper mix of saving cash and health insurance. Even if your insurance cover takes care of 50% of your bill, it will be worth it. Q. Fortunately, life insurance is more common so that surviving members are not financially ruined. A. Yes and here too, only the sole bread winner’s life must be insured for a high sum. There’s no need to insure your child and any non-earning member because it’s meaningless. Another thing that every bread winner must do immediately is to make the surviving members financially literate. Because once the windfall from life insurance reaches the nominee, usually the wife, there may not be enough financial wisdom to handle that huge corpus. That money must be wisely invested else it shall disappear faster than it came. I hope that every bread winner immediately starts the task of making their nominee aware of these issues. Q. The Covid-19 pandemic has also led to job and salary cuts as well. How can people handle their finances better? A. Financial planning is a long-term thing and cannot provide a safety net overnight. So whatever situation you find yourself in now, the key is financial discipline. Spending less than you earn is financial discipline. Not spending on emotional impulses is financial wisdom. Remember money has no emotion, it’s the person having it who makes irrational decisions. The general practice is to spend and then save, rather we must first save and then spend whatever is left. But while I give this advise, I am aware that many people are barely able to meet their expenses or are running a deficit household budget because of the unexpected financial crisis. Hence no one should get fooled by quick fix financial solutions being offered by glib salesmen. So those who are now able to survive, start thinking long-term. Q. While mutual funds are touted as the best long-term saving solution, people who used that route to save up ended up woefully short because of inflation. A. There are two separate points here and I’ll take the first one about mutual funds. Usually MFs with a solid track record of last three to four years are sold to customers because it looks attractive. Very few actively managed funds give 12%-15% compounded returns annually. So it is much better to invest in low cost index funds and stay invested, because it is observed in India that over an eight-year period, the index has generally delivered positive returns. The second part is that inflation works differently for different sectors. The cost of telephone communication has fallen drastically in the last decade. But education costs have risen by 15%-20% every year. So overall, the inflation basket may be around 7%, but we need to understand what we are saving for and then allocate accordingly. You may not always be able to reach 100% of your saving target, because it depends on how much money you can spare each month. So even if you can save up for 50% of your future target without compromising on your current lifestyle, then it’s good.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/set-aside-funds-get-health-cover-for-med-emergency/articleshow/82235271.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

In a blog post on Friday, Dominic Cummings accused Johnson of attempting an “unethical, foolish, possibly illegal” plan to get Conservative Party donors to fund a lavish refurbishment of the flat, which he lives in with fiancee Carrie Symonds and their son. The charge is the latest in a string of allegations that Johnson and other Conservatives broke rules relating to contacts with donors and businessmen. Opposition parties have picked up on them ahead of local polls next month. The government said on Friday that Johnson himself met the cost of the apartment refurbishment, reported to be anywhere from around £60,000 to £200,000 ($80,000 to $280,000). But the opposition Labour Party said the PM needed to explain how he obtained the money to pay for the work overseen by Symonds. Labour leader Keir Starmer latched onto the allegation and called for a probe. “It is about integrity. It is about taxpayers’ money. Every day there is more evidence of this sleaze.” he told BBC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/boris-faces-questions-over-costly-flat-revamp-bill/articleshow/82237848.cms||---

Assistant engineer of the PWD’s water supply division in Canacona, Lester D’Souza, said that tenders for the works will be floated once the code of conduct is lifted. “A tender for repair-cum-replacement of the existing pipeline was floated earlier at a cost of Rs 66 lakh, but there were no bids,” he said. The 3-decade-old pipeline has corroded at some places with some joints getting dislocated. “More than 500 families were dependent on this pipeline for water requirements. Over the years, the population of the hamlets has gone up, leading to rise in water demand. But the availability of the water has remained the same,” said a local, Shantaram Desai. Officials opine that the difficult terrain inside forested areas may be deterring contractors from undertaking repair works. “Ruptures in the pipeline means that the water cannot reach the storage tank situated between Borden and Avli. Installed during the tenure of the then minister Vasu Paik Gaonkar has not seen any maintenance work over the years, said Bordem resident Devidas Gaonkar. With Canacona taluka experiencing water shortage, many have dug borewells to meet their requirement. This is impacting the water table, killing the last of natural source from which the villagers can meet their needs, locals said. Women in some of the affected areas said they have to walk a long distance to fetch water. “People’s livelihood here mostly depends on cattle rearing, which also needs significant amount of water. The panic situation has made our life miserable,” said a local woman. “Earlier, residents of these areas did not have sanitation facilities. Now the use of toilets and other facilities have further increased the demand for water. The supply needs to be augmented,” said one Rukhmavati Gaonkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-30-year-old-pipeline-ruptured-cotigao-locals-water-woes-multiply/articleshow/82235882.cms||Albert Fernandes

Lokesh said that he regrets the chief minister’s firm decision to conduct examinations even after his letter appealing for the cancellation of exams. Speaking to the media in virtual mode, Lokesh said that his party had convened a ‘digital townhall’ to take views of students and parents on holding exams. They all expressed fears of being exposed to Covid. Lokesh added that his party will hold another round of digital townhall with students and parents and send a report to the state government seeking cancellation of exams. “If the government remains adamant, the party would hold protests and also take the issue to court,” Lokesh said, while citing several states that have either cancelled or postponed exams. “Even CBSE and ICSE have cancelled exams,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/lokesh-wants-class-10-inter-exams-cancelled/articleshow/82234671.cms||Gopi Dara

Sheik Zuber of Dil Se Hyderabadi Haleem Centre, located near Mecca Masjid in Vizag, said that business usually peaks at night. “However, considering the night curfew, we have started serving Haleem from the afternoon from Saturday. We have had to reschedule our preparation for this.” Restaurant owners in the city too are chalking out plans to increase takeaway and home-delivery through food delivery apps at night. Akella Venkata Ramana Murthy, president of Andhra Pradesh Hotels Association (APHA) said that the night curfew will hurt their business as most people visit restaurants after 9pm only. “We are focussing on takeaway services during the night to mitigate losses. Our business has declined by 30 per cent since the beginning of the second wave. We are hoping to flatten the graph by May,” said the APHA president.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/now-haleem-counters-to-run-from-afternoon/articleshow/82234678.cms||Nalla.Babu

After announcing night curfew from 10 pm to 5 am till further orders, a GO was issued on Saturday explaining the guidelines to be enforced during the curfew period. The order imposes a ban on sale of non-vegetarian items like fish, chicken and mutton on Sunday. All meat shops have been told to down their shutters for the day. Meanwhile, the government has written to vaccine manufacturers — Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech and Pune-based Seerum Institute of India — to supply 4.08 crore vaccine doses to the state. As the government has already announced to administer free vaccine to all adults in the state, chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy wants enough doses to be in stock ahead of launching the programme on May 1. The number of adults (over 18 years) in the state is estimated to around 2.04 crore. All of them would require two doses each in a gap of 28 days. Muddada Ravichandra, principal secretary (Covid management & vaccination) wrote the letters to Bharat Biotech MD Krishna Yella and Serum Institute of India CEO Adar Poonawalla in this regard. “Extensive arrangements have been made at the state vaccine store (Gannavaram), as well as regional and district vaccine stores with state-of-the-art equipment for maintenance of vaccines and proper linkage of supply and monitoring. A mechanism to vaccinate over 6 lakh people per day is already in place. Hence, the vaccine doses may be supplied, as early as possible, directly to the state government and payment shall be made as per the commercials, as per rules,” Ravichandra said in the letter. Meanwhile, the panchayat raj department has appealed to the government to consider National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) staff as frontline warriors and provide them vaccine on priority. Panchayati raj and rural development minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy and commissioner Girija Shankar have written to district collectors to consider NREGS staff to be given vaccination on priority. There are over 20,000 NREGS staff, including some officers, in the programme. The staff and officers deal with lakhs of daily wage labourers across the state. The government has provided employment to the rural poor during the pandemic, the minister said, adding that 100 days’ wages would also be given to seven lakh rural families in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-orders-4cr-vaccine-doses-tightens-curbs/articleshow/82234681.cms||---
---||Kolkata||ITC ties up with Linde India to import cryo-containers||Kolkata: ITC on Saturday said it has tied up with Linde India Ltd to airfreight 24 cryogenic 20-tonne containers from Asian countries to transport medical oxygen. There is a major shortage of cryogenic containers and cylinders in the country. Industry experts feel that increasing oxygen production is not that big a challenge compared to other infrastructure bottlenecks. ITC said in a statement its initiative came in the wake of an acute shortage of medical oxygen across the country, constraining the healthcare system’s ability to provide necessary medical care to Covid-19 patients. With the unprecedented emergency caused by the pandemic’s second wave, there has been an exponential rise in demand for medical oxygen, which is the most critical need at this hour to save lives. ITC said it is also airlifting large numbers of oxygen concentrators for distribution, while its paperboards unit in Bhadrachalam has started supply of oxygen to neighbouring areas. Stating that it is committed to support the government in its fight against the pandemic, ITC said it will “continue to explore other avenues to help address the challenges emerging during these trying times”. In India, oxygen production per day was 56,000-60,000 tonnes per day. This includes oxygen for cylinder, pipeline and in liquid form. As per available data, from 2016-19, the oxygen consumption for medical purposes was 1,600-2,000 tonnes per day. “There has been a surge in oxygen demand to 10,000 tonnes per day in 2020 though compared to overall capacity of production, it was still nearly 20%. Now even if we see a further surge, it should not be alarming. But the real problem would be other infrastructure,” an expert added. Several other experts suggested that cylinders for medical oxygen were in limited supply coupled with cryogenic tankers for transportation of oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/itc-ties-up-with-linde-india-to-import-cryo-containers/articleshow/82236040.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Surge in West Bengal as EC listened to BJP: CM Mamata Banerjee||BOLPUR: Covid surged in Bengal because the Election Commission “listened to the BJP”, Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee said on Saturday, adding that she would move the Supreme Court after the assembly polls to “insulate the EC from political interference”. Banerjee, talking to reporters in Bolpur after her public rallies were cancelled because of Covid restrictions, questioned the EC’s “stubbornness” in refusing to club the last few phases of voting. “Covid has surged (here) because they (the EC) listened to the BJP. The EC is the BJP’s mirror,” she said, accusing PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah of taking the nation towards disaster in their bid “to capture Bengal”. Both should resign for their “monumental incompetence”, she added. The Bengal CM also cited purported WhatsApp chats between poll observers and Birbhum district officials and accused them of “ordering and planning” preventive detenion of Trinamool workers. She would move the Supreme Court after the assembly elections to “insulate the EC from political interference”, she said, asking: “Why preventive detentions? Is it to help the BJP?” “The documents I have, the evidence that has reached me … I have decided to move the SC. Elections must be impartial. This is the larger issue. Whatever the BJP is saying, they (the EC) are doing that. Retired officers are EC observers and these retired officers are instructing serving officers. The instructions are clear. How many people have been arrested? How many have been kept under preventive detention?” she said, alleging everything was being done to to help the BJP. “I have documents,” she said, adding that she had got them from the media and “some people within the BJP” and accusing the BJP of doing “tandav” in Naihati, Bijpur, Kanchrapara and Jadagaddal. “The trouble mongers they refer to (in their chats) are all Trinamool workers. How can they refer to our party workers as goons in official instructions? People are being picked from home at 4 a.m. on polling day and being kept in police stations. Nandigram was a revelation; party leader Abdus Samad’s driver was asked to report to the police station the night before polling and stay there. A party leader was detained in Dum Dum North till 4 p.m. on polling day,” she said. “I would like to alert party workers not to allow such illegal detentions. Family members and party workers should gherao police stations. Lodge FIRs, move court,” she said, urging Birbhum Trinamool president Anubrata Mandal to move the Calcutta High Court if the EC ordered his detention. “But, whatever they do, they can at best help rig six or seven seats. The BJP will find it difficult to get even 70 seats,” Banerjee added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/surge-in-bengal-as-ec-listened-to-bjp-cm/articleshow/82236578.cms||Someswar Boral

In the rest of the state, one of four RT-PCR report is Covid positive. That is a five-fold jump from the beginning of the month, when only one of 20 tests was positive. “Laboratories in Kolkata and surrounding areas are reporting a positivity rate of 45%-55% while in other parts of the state the positivity rate is around 24%, up from 5% at the beginning of this month,” said a doctor attached to one of the largest laboratories conducting RT-PCR tests in the state.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); This, a senior doctor at a state-run hospital said, is only the tip of the iceberg. “The actual positivity rate will be much higher.

State BJP vice-president Pratap Banerjee pointed fingers at Trinamool Congress and outgoing councillor of KMC’s ward 59 Jolly Bose. “Trinamool leaders are doing this out of frustration. Their goons attacked our women members. One of them is hospitalised,” Banerjee said. Trinamool denied the allegations and filed a counter-complaint at Topsia thana, where party workers later clashed with BJP supporters in front of police. Post-poll violence also continued unabated in the Barrackpore industrial belt. Bombs were lobbed and bullets fired in Naihati, Amdanga, Jagaddal and Bijpur all through Friday, leaving many injured. Several places in Naihati — including Bijaynagar, Saheb Colony, BRS Colony and Kadamtala — witnessed random bombing and firing as clashes broke out between supporters of Trinamool and BJP. Residents alleged that armed goons were roaming free while the authorities were turning a blind eye to the law and order situation. “Goons hired by both camps opened fire and hurled bombs at each other. Innocent people were injured,” a local trader said. BJP leaders claimed a Trinamool attack left 10 supporters injured.

The man was admitted to Salboni Superspecialty Hospital on April 22. He tested positive and was under treatment since. Around 1.30am on Saturday, he went missing from his bed, which prompted the hospital staff to launch a search on the premises. They heard a loud thud soon thereafter and found the patient in a puddle of blood in the eastern corner of the hospital. Following preliminary investigation, police said the patient had jumped off the fourth floor roof. Surveillance camera footage, recovered by police, shows him breaking a glass window to gain access to the roof. It is not immediately clear how he got there without being noticed or stopped. Sources said the patient was in the habit of loitering alone and had tried to leave the premises on Friday. The hospital, which has show-caused security guards, said family members of the deceased had been alerted immediately after he was found missing from his bed. They arrived on Saturday morning and were informed about the body being found. Salboni police have registered an unnatural death case and sent the body for post-mortem. Senior officers said they could confirm the exact cause of death once the autopsy report arrived. Saumya Shankar Sarengi, the deputy chief medical officer of West Midnapore, called it an “unfortunate” incident. “A patient’s body was recovered (from hospital premises) and sent for post-mortem. The reason (behind his death) will be known after a detailed investigation by police,” Sarengi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covid-patient-jumps-to-death-from-hospital-roof-in-salboni/articleshow/82236099.cms||Sujoy Khanra

DC Rajesh Singh asked Dr Bharti to respond to the notice, which asked her to explain her stand within 24 hours and explain why an FIR should not be filed against her under the relevant sections of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The notice also asked her to explain why her medical licence should not be cancelled. Singh said, "Dr Bharti was found ignoring the Covid-19 patients.

The team also found that the Covid patients and their families have been regularly complaining about negligence. Despite the critical condition of the patients, neither doctors nor nurses were present in the hospital. Dr Bharti was also unable to provide the list of doctors, nurses and other personnel deputed in the Covid ward to the inspecting SDO. She was also not able to explain details of the bed management.

The latest incident took place at Sudamdih on Saturday where two bike-borne masked criminals fired at the manager of an outsourcing company and hurled a bomb demanding extortion money. The manager escaped with minor injuries but the incident has once again exposed the failure of the police in reigning in extortion gangs active in the district. According to reports, someone knocked at the doors of Sudamdih riverside BCCL colony residence of Madhu Singh, the site in-charge of outsourcing company Dhansar Engineering and Company (DECo) at 5.30am. When he opened the door, he found two masked youths wearing black shirts who gave him a letter saying that it had been sent by Aman Singh. When he asked who Singh is, the youth fired at him but it could not hurt him as he ducked and tried to close the door. By that time, the youth fired the second shot which hit the door panel after touching his right shoulder. The criminals hurled a country-made bomb while fleeing to scare away the colony people. Sudamdih police recovered one live cartridge, one spent cartridge and vestiges of the country made bomb from the spot. Dhanbad SP (city) R Ramkumar, SDPO Sindri Ajit Sinha visited the spot and said the police were investigating the incident from different angles. It can be noted here that Aman Singh is a prime accused in former Deputy Mayor Neeraj Singh’s murder case and is languishing in Ranchi jail. It is said that he is running an extortion racket from behind the bars and outsourcing companies and big businessmen are buying peace by paying hefty amounts of extortion money to his men in the coalfield. More than two dozen cases of firing and hurling bombs for collecting extortion are under investigation of Dhanbad police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/unidentified-men-fire-at-site-in-charge-of-outsourcing-co-hurl-bomb-in-dhanbad/articleshow/82235211.cms||Anil Ashutosh

The Bengal BJP had arranged the rally in support of Baishnabnagar candidate Swadhin Sarkar after party national president JP Nadda’s rally in the constituency was dropped. Hundreds of youths had gathered around the Malda helipad to catch a glimpse of ‘mahaguru’, far exceeding the EC-mandated cap in wake of the second wave of Covid-19. Trinamool Congress senior and MP Saugata Roy took up two complaints with the EC drawing its attention to the rallies by Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh on Friday and Chakraborty on Saturday. “Both these rallies have flouted the model conduct code and also the EC stipulation on rallies asking political parties to cap the participation to 500 only. We have urged the EC to keep both Ghosh and Chakraborty out of the election campaign in the last two phases,” Roy said. The Malda district magistrate has ordered police to initiate a case under the Disaster Management Act. Bengal BJP seniors Sayantan Basu and candidate Sarkar, present at Friday’s rally, couldn’t control the crowd. Chakraborty, while waving at the crowd, urged participants not to break Covid protocol. “Don’t break discipline, be quiet and keep distance,” the actor said. But nobody listened to him and the crowd kept shouting for dialogues from his films. BJP state vice-president Pratap Banerjee tried to give a weak defence. “We had arranged for a rally with 500 participants. But people came in huge numbers to catch a glimpse of Mithun Chakraborty. People also want to listen to the Bengal BJP president about the roadmap for ‘Sonar Bangla’,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ec-orders-fir-against-mithuns-malda-rally/articleshow/82236221.cms||Subhro Maitra

Making this observation, former head of the department of management, IIT (ISM), Dhanbad and internationally acclaimed expert on stress management Pramod Pathak called upon people not to press the panic button and allow pessimism to control their thought process. Talking to TOI, Dr Pathak said that by now it has become amply clear that nearly 95% virus infected people are getting cured anyway. “Rest 3% win over the virus after proper treatment and only 2% face chances of death due to weak immunity and other ailments aggravated due to the virus. But majority of the people start counting them among the 2% even with a minor symptom of infection or hearing about other in the neighbourhood getting infected,” he said. According to him, over flooding of Covid related information everywhere related to deaths due to the virus and problems due to lack of infrastructural facilities and medicine has created an atmosphere of pessimism which is affecting the mental health of the public. “It’s time that everyone speaks about recoveries and not deaths to create a positive atmosphere.

Biden became the first US president to use the word genocide in a statement on the anniversary, a day after informing Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan of the decision and seeking to limit the furor from the NATO ally. "We remember the lives of all those who died in the Ottoman-era Armenian genocide and recommit ourselves to preventing such an atrocity from ever again occurring," Biden said. "We affirm the history. We do this not to cast blame but to ensure that what happened is never repeated." The statement is a massive victory for Armenia and its extensive diaspora. Starting with Uruguay in 1965, nations including France, Germany, Canada and Russia have recognized the genocide, but a US statement has been a paramount goal that proved elusive under previous presidents. Erdogan, in a statement to the Armenian patriarch in Istanbul, said debates "should be held by historians" and not "politicized by third parties." "Words cannot change or rewrite history," Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu tweeted moments after Biden's statement. "We will not take lessons from anyone on our history." The Turkish foreign ministry later summoned US Ambassador David Satterfield to express its displeasure, noting that Biden's decision caused "a wound in relations that is difficult to repair," the Anadolu state news agency reported. Explaining Biden's thinking, an administration official pointed to the Democratic president's vows to put a new priority on human rights and highlighted his outspokenness on systemic racism in the United States. Across the world, "people are beginning to acknowledge and address and grapple with the painful historical facts in their own countries. It's certainly something that we are doing here in the United States," the official said. As many as 1.5 million Armenians are estimated to have been killed from 1915 to 1917 during the waning days of the Ottoman Empire, which suspected the Christian minority of conspiring with adversary Russia in World War I. Armenian populations were rounded up and deported into the desert of Syria on death marches in which many were shot, poisoned or fell victim to disease, according to accounts at the time by foreign diplomats. Turkey, which emerged as a secular republic from the ashes of the Ottoman Empire, acknowledges that 300,000 Armenians may have died but strongly rejects that it was genocide, saying they perished in strife and famine in which many Turks also died. Recognition has been a top priority for Armenia and Armenian-Americans, with calls for compensation and property restoration over what they call Meds Yeghern -- the Great Crime -- and appeals for more support against Turkish-backed neighbor Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijani foreign ministry said Biden's statement "distorted the historical facts about the events of 1915" and echoed Turkey's call for the killings to be "studied by historians, not politicians." Azerbaijan defeated Armenia last year in a war over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, in which Ankara backed its ally Baku and which left Armenia traumatized. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan thanked Biden for his "powerful step towards justice and invaluable support to the heirs of the Armenian genocide victims." In the Armenian capital Yerevan, Taline Nourian, 41, said her people have been waiting for this moment for years. "We wanted it before Biden," she told AFP. "I think Turkey will be afraid now because all countries are going to start recognizing (the genocide)." Biden, whose call to Erdogan to inform him of the genocide recognition was their first conversation since the US leader took office three months ago, signaled he hoped to contain the fallout. They agreed in their call to meet in June on the sidelines of a NATO summit in Brussels, officials said. Beyond statements and the summoning of the US ambassador, Turkey did not immediately announce any retaliatory steps -- in contrast to angry measures taken over previous Western moves to recognize the genocide. Tensions have risen sharply with Turkey in recent years over its purchase of a major air defense system from NATO adversary Russia, and its incursions against pro-US Kurdish fighters in Syria. The US Congress in 2019 voted overwhelmingly to recognize the Armenian genocide, but the Trump administration made clear that the official US line had not changed. Alan Makovsky, an expert on Turkey at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, said that the 2019 congressional resolution had "no discernible impact" on US-Turkey relations -- and paved the way for Biden to go ahead. At a pro-Armenia rally in New York on Saturday, the crowd of several hundred included Aram Bowen, 33, whose great-great-grandfather was beheaded by the Ottomans during the massacres. "Turkey is never going to recognize it as genocide," he said. "So for us on so many levels, the closest thing to that actually becoming official worldwide, it was when the United States and the president himself acknowledged the genocide."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/biden-recognizes-armenian-genocide-defying-turkey-in-watershed/articleshow/82237882.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Deadliest day: Covid claims 2 lives/hour in Lucknow||LUCKNOW: Saturday will go down as the deadliest day of Covid-19 pandemic with the disease killing two patients every hour. Even as the streets were deserted due to weekend curfew, a storm of grief engulfed many households and institutions with the novel coronavirus infection snuffing out life of 42 patients, many of whom died at home without even getting medical assistance or oxygen due to acute crisis of critical care beds and lifesaving gas. The deadly strike rate of the second wave could be gauged from the fact that it has killed 430 people in 24 days of April so far, nearly one third of the total casualties that have taken place in 14 months of pandemic so far. Of these 430, over 250 fatalities took place in the past 10 days at the rate of a death every hour. A diabolic equaliser, the novel coronavirus spared none from politicians to doctors and commoners. Overall, 1,640 people have died since the outbreak. Also, for the 13th day in a row, over 5,000 new infections were recorded in the city on Saturday, leaving the already overwhelmed hospitals, overflowing with patients. Overstretched due to the increase in demand for Covid-19 test, most labs are giving test results in three-four days. Even funeral services were working overtime with LMC making arrangements of readymade 100 wooden pyres at Baikunth Dham. The new cases led to a rise in the patients with active infection to 53,143. Of these over 4,000 were in hospitals and among them the condition of 2,500 was either serious or critical. Although the majority of the new cases were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms, many critical ones were not able to get beds in the hospitals. With blood oxygen levels dipping fast, these patients are surviving somehow by arranging oxygen at home. However, as the oxygen crisis continued, people queued up in large numbers since wee hours outside oxygen plants, waiting with bated breath to get a refill for their loved ones gasping for breath at home. However, even waiting for 12-14 hours, several had to go back disappointed as the plant gave priority to hospital supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/deadliest-day-covid-claims-2-lives/hour-in-lucknow/articleshow/82237896.cms||---

The government also decided to provide Covid-19 vaccination free of cost to all persons aged 18 to 45. Office of J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha said that essential and emergency services will be allowed during the curfew, but all markets and commercial institutions will remain closed. In a tweet, the LG office stated: “It has been decided that Covid-19 vaccination for people in the age group 18 to 45 years will be cost-free in the UT. The cost of the vaccine will be fully borne by the government of J&K. The health department will constitute a panel to work out the logistics.” Earlier on April 8, the J&K administration had imposed night curfew from 10pm to 6am in urban areas of eight districts — Jammu, Udhampur, Kathua, Srinagar, Baramulla, Budgam, Anantnag and Kupwara — which was further extended to municipal and urban local bodies of all 20 districts on April 20. On April 23, the total number of Covid-19 cases in J&K surged to 1,56,344 with 1,937 more positive cases while the death toll climbed to 2,111 with a record jump in daily deaths to 19 (13 from Jammu and 6 from Kashmir).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-surge-jk-orders-curfew-from-apr-24-26/articleshow/82237895.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

A BSF spokesperson said, “Around 4.30am, two unmanned aerial vehicles were spotted entering the Indian territory from the Pakistan side and were immediately fired upon by vigilant BSF troops, which compelled the machines to retreat to Pakistan territory.” He added, “Despite the existence of ceasefire agreement between Pakistan and India, Pakistan Rangers have not stopped their nefarious activities against India.” Pakistan Rangers in the recent past had been regularly violating the international boundary through drone intrusions and by trying to drop arms/ammunition inside the Indian territory. BSF shot down a Pak hexacopter carrying a huge cache of arms/ammunition on June 20 last year at Pansar. Another Pak drone was seen near the IB in the Arnia sector on the evening of November 28, 2020, which also was pushed back by alert BSF troops. In another incident on November 20, BSF troops noticed a drone flying inside the Indian territory in the Samba sector a day after security forces successfully foiled the nefarious designs of Pakistan by neutralizing four terrorists of Jaish-e-Mohammad in Nagrota. “Today’s drone intrusion bid foiled by BSF is indicative of alertness and swift retaliatory action by BSF. The BSF intelligence branch was receiving inputs about the possible use of drones by Pakistan for ferrying arms and ammunition from Pakistan into Indian side. Accordingly, the troops have been on the alert, and the border domination has exponentially increased,” the spokesperson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bsf-prevents-pak-drones-from-entering-indian-territory/articleshow/82237917.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

The mission wrote on its official Twitter account that India urgently needs "empty refillable oxygen cylinders with 10-litre and 45-litre LMO capacity, oxygen concentrators as well as "in situ oxygen manufacturing plants for hospitals" and the drug Remdesvir. Any individual that can help is urged to write to Rahul Nangare at fstrade.london@meagov.in. https://t.co/fOj5EQBHEt— India in the UK (@HCI_London) 1619282172000The appeal came a day after UK PM Boris Johnson said the UK was ready to provide whatever assistance India needs. Indian diplomatic sources told TOI that the Indian high commissioner in London, Gaitri Kumar, and British high commisioner to India Alex Ellis were in direct contact and high-level talks about how the UK could assist India had begun. Remdesivir was deveoped by Gilead Sciences, headquartered in California. "There is huge demand and the peak has not come yet, so that is why demand exceeds supply for remdesivir and oxygen," the source said. Late Saturday night the British Asian Trust launched an emergency appeal to raise funds to help Indians affected by the deadly second wave of Covid-19. The British Asian Trust 'India Covid-19 emergency appeal' was launched on Virgin Money and JustGiving websites. "Daily Covid-19 cases are the highest on record for any country at any point during the pandemic - and the worst still to come. Families cannot get treatment for their loved ones and the lockdown continues to impact livelihoods, education and mental health," the appeal states. Lord Gadhia, a trustee of the Trust, said: "We are getting a lot of enquires from the UK Indian diaspora about how they can help in the current situation. We have therefore launched appeal pages on the two major UK donation sites. The British Asian Trust works with some long-standing and highly reputable delivery partners in India like Jan Sahas and Goonj to reach the frontline. In the last campaign during the first lockdown in India we raised £1 million in our Covid-19 emergency appeal and were able to save 137,000 lives by reaching 27,500 families with emergency kits containing essential food and hygiene rations. This time around we will assess the most pressing requirements and act accordingly."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/indian-mission-in-uk-sends-sos-for-covid-help/articleshow/82237930.cms||NAOMI CANTON

He said the government has decided to adopt the United Kingdom model when the second wave swept that country in December 2020 to ensure critical patients get treatment on priority. “Several beds are being occupied by asymptomatic patients or mild-symptomatic patients and this has resulted in a shortage of beds. Some have managed to get them using influence,” he said. With Bengaluru Urban district having the highest number of active cases in the country, the cabinet meeting on Monday may consider extending a complete lockdown till May 4. Currently, the government has imposed partial lockdown on weekdays and complete lockdown on weekends, besides the night curfew from 9pm to 6am on all days. Official sources said the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Covid has asked the government to impose stringent restrictions, including lockdown for 14 days, to break the chain. Panel members have also recommended increasing the number of beds to tide over the crisis. The members also foresee a third wave in October-November and have insisted that the government complete the vaccination of vulnerable age groups and ramp up health infrastructure and medical supplies accordingly. “The cabinet will discuss TAC’s suggestions and take a final call,’’ said a health department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/karnataka-mulls-hospitalisation-only-if-oxygen-level-is-below-90/articleshow/82241068.cms||---

There are six oxygen manufacturing units in the city and two major refillers. There are two types of oxygen makers — bulk liquid plants and air separation units. The bulk liquid plant has a larger capacity as compared to a separation unit. There is a single bulk liquid manufacturer in the region, Inox Air Products Limited, Butibori. It produces liquid oxygen, which is converted to gaseous state and administered to patients. Even in an air separation unit, oxygen is first taken out from air in liquid form and then turned into gas and filled in cylinders. A bulk liquid maker can cater to a larger consumer base. The single Inox plant not only caters to hospitals in Nagpur but also other centres in the region. The liquid oxygen supplied by Inox is turned into gas by hospitals. The rest depend on cylinders that come from air separation units. Refillers also get liquid from Inox and fill gas into cylinders and supply to hospitals. Patients not on ventilators require 5 litres of oxygen a minute on an average. This translates to one cylinder per day. Those on ventilator need 10 cylinders and those on bi-pap need 5 cylinders at least, said a hospital source. GMC alone has 850 patients needing different quantities of oxygen. Industry sources say Inox is contributing to oxygen equivalent to 8,500 cylinders. This not only goes to major hospitals like GMC and Mayo, but also elsewhere in the region apart from supplies to major private hospitals with their own liquid oxygen storage plants. The five air separation units contribute around 7,500 cylinders in all. Apart from this, liquid equivalent to 3,000 odd cylinders is being procured from Praxair India Private Limited, Bhilai. Praxair is the supplier to SAIL’s Bhilai Steel Plant. The supply from Bhilai has been cut as demand in Chhattisgarh has gone up, said a source. Now much depends on fresh consignments coming by rail from the Vizag steel plant. There is no fixed estimate of the demand from hospitals. To get a perfect estimate the requirement of home quarantine patients, Covid care centres and other smaller hospitals need to be calculated, said a source in the industries. Dr Anup Marar, convenor of Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA), said, “There is a shortage. Due to this, a number of hospitals have kept their plans to expand their Covid treatment facility on hold.” Hospitals like Kingsway have their own oxygen extraction unit. An official at the hospital said they can make oxygen enough for 150 cylinders from their plant but their requirement stands at 350 cylinders. The plant’s capacity will be augmented by another 60 cylinders, for which the order had been placed over a month ago. The new machinery is expected to reach in week. Setting up an air filtration plant at the hospital can be another option to deal with the crisis. However, this is not an overnight process. It also depends on availably of the equipment and approvals. The whole process from producing the unit, which includes a compressor, takes at least one-and-a-half-months, said a source. There are plans to get oxygen supply from Uttam Galva’s steel plant. A source in the management here said they are searching for a compressor, without which medical oxygen cannot be supplied.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/demand-far-outstrips-oxygen-industry-capacity-in-region/articleshow/82235693.cms||Shishir Arya

Karnataka too reported record numbers — 29,438 cases and 208 deaths — in a single day. With this, the total number of active cases touched 2.34 lakh, at a positivity rate of 15.52%. Nearly 70% of this active tally, over 1.6 lakh cases, is in Bengaluru alone. And the city’s active caseload is nearly 26% of its total infections, against 18% statewide. CM BS Yediyurappa said on Saturday that the Centre has increased the state’s daily allocation of oxygen from 300MT to 800MT and Remdesivir from 50,000 vials to 1.22 lakh vials till April 30. Chief secretary P Ravi Kumar maintained there was no shortage of oxygen and the problem pertained to distribution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-hits-another-record-of-17342-covid-19-cases-149-deaths/articleshow/82237962.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||700 people are testing Covid-19 positive every hour in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: Infections are spreading at a rapid rate in the tech capital. Every hour, a staggering 700 people are testing positive for Covid-19, and each person has up to eight contacts, according to the available data. With the city reporting an average of 15,000 new cases daily, the demand for hospital beds, especially ICU and ventilator ones, has overwhelmed the healthcare infrastructure and brought the state government to its knees. “We are doing our best, but hospital beds cannot be created overnight,” chief secretary P Ravi Kumar, who is overseeing mitigation measures, said on Saturday. Health minister K Sudhakar, whose office is flooded with requests for oxygenated beds, underscored the seriousness of the situation. “We are in a war kind of a situation; we are fighting,” he said. Bengaluru’s rising Covid trajectory has baffled health experts and bureaucrats. “The situation on the ground is quite bad. People are desperate to get beds in hospitals, which don’t have any to spare,” said a senior official, warning that this was just the beginning of the second wave. The number of hospitalisation requests is so high that even elected representatives and senior bureaucrats are unable to arrange facilities, leaving families to fend for themselves. The city has been conducting around 1 lakh tests per day, and the positivity rate has crossed 15 per cent, i.e. 15 out of every 100 people tested are diagnosed with Covid-19. “The infection is spreading with such ferocity that we are beginning to witness long queues at testing centres as more primary and secondary contacts turn up to ascertain their health status,” said a health official of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). Of those testing positive, barely 5 per cent actually require hospitalisation. “But fear levels are so high that almost everyone starts searching for and blocking hospital beds immediately after testing positive,” the official added. Doctors and experts said that the situation would not have been this bad had the government and top officials woken up in time to the warnings of the second wave. “It is only now that they are drawing plans to add beds, streamline oxygen supply and ensure availability of drugs,” said a doctor at a government hospital. Senior government officials attribute the transmission of the virus to the breach of Covid-19 protocols and increased movement of people. “The government alone cannot do everything. People should also be responsible,” said chief secretary Ravi Kumar, adding that bed capacity was being strengthened. On when the plans would materialise, he said: “Even if we have decided to open an oxygen line and deploy ventilators, it will take a minimum of 15 days.” Covid care centres will get more oxygenated beds. Sudhakar said that the shortages of ICU beds and ventilators were being addressed and efforts were underway to increase the patient recovery rate. “We have warned hospitals against admitting asymptomatic patients or the ones with mild symptoms. They should instead focus on patients who require critical care,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/700-people-are-testing-covid-19-positive-every-hour-in-bengaluru/articleshow/82237975.cms||Rakesh Prakash

The timings of the meeting of the faculty will be informed by the registrar. There is no change in the date of elections of the other constituencies. Vikram Nayyar, officiating registrar, PU, said given the number of members in each faculty, it was difficult to conduct physical meeting (which is a mandatory component of election), in the light of the restrictions imposed on physical gatherings by the UT administration, Chandigarh. It was, therefore, decided to hold formal meetings of faculty in an online mode, and accordingly a notice of the revised timing and mode of meetings and election of faculties was scheduled for April 26. Further, the office received representations from some of the members of the faculty to postpone the elections as they expressed their inability to participate in the election process due to the surge in the cases. Concerns have also been expressed about the validity of online meeting of faculty in the absence of any explicit provision in the PU calendar. “After seeking legal opinion on the issue to avoid any complication at a later stage, the competent authority rescheduled the polling to May 19,” said the registrar. However, Puta members said there are no words needed to explain in detail the conduct of those having politically motivated interests. “The elections have been postponed before less then 48 hours. Their only agenda is to delay and defeat the democratic process,” allege members of Puta. The total number of candidates at faculty constituency are 12 with six booths and 754 voters will decide the fate of the candidates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/panjab-university-extends-senate-elections-to-may-19/articleshow/82237979.cms||Arvind Bishnoi

The state added 14,842 new cases and 80 deaths, pushing the cumulative case tally to 10,66,329 and death toll to 13,475. On Saturday, 9,142 patients were discharged. Chennai reported 25 deaths, Chengalpet and Tiruvallur seven each, Madurai five and Kancheepuram four. Chennai, which reported 4,086 new cases, was left with 31,506 active cases by the end of the day. Two other districts – Chengalpet (1,163) and Coimbatore (1,004) reported a four-digit increase, while 28 other districts reported a three-digit increase. Perambalur (19) reported the least number of fresh cases in the state. Health secretary J Radhakrishnan said nearly half of active cases in the state were still home quarantined and about 8.85% of patients were in Covid care centres and 25.8% were in hospitals. “Most patients admitted to government hospitals are those who require oxygen, aggressive therapy and intensive care,” he said, urging people who test positive or show symptoms not to rush to hospitals. Those with symptoms or those tested positive can call helplines for guidance, he said. The screening centres in Chennai do basic blood test and Xrays for Covid patients, and doctors advise patients home isolation or hospitalization. “We must trust our doctors. With such a model, Kerala has been able to keep most of its tertiary care beds, oxygen and other resources for sick people,” he said. “If patients are fine after three days of treatment in a medical college hospital, doctors send them either to a health centre, covid care centre or their home based on their condition,” said director of medical education Dr R Narayanababu. The state will also depute more than 350 doctors appointed through the medical recruitment board and 1,600 doctors posted at mini clinics to the Covid hospitals. The directorate of medical education is working with self-financing medical colleges to ensure enough beds, manpower and infrastructure for patients during the surge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/1-lakh-active-covid-19-cases-tamil-nadu-revises-care-protocol/articleshow/82238312.cms||---

---||World||At least 23 dead in fire at Baghdad Covid hospital||BAGHDAD: At least 23 people died when a fire broke out Sunday in a coronavirus intensive care unit in the capital of Iraq, a country with long-dilapidated health infrastructure facing mounting Covid-19 cases. The fire started with an explosion caused by "a fault in the storage of oxygen cylinders", medical sources told AFP. It spread quickly, according to the civil defence, as "the hospital had no fire protection system and false ceilings allowed the flames to spread to highly flammable products". Iraq's hospitals have been worn down by decades of conflict and poor investment, with shortages in medicines and hospital beds. The incident sparked outrage on social media and the prime minister has called for an investigation into the cause of the blaze. In the middle of the night, as dozens of relatives were at the bedsides of the 30 patients in the intensive care unit at Ibn al-Khatib hospital -- reserved for the most severe Covid-19 cases in Baghdad -- flames spread across multiple floors, another medical source said. Videos on social media showed firefighters trying to extinguish flames at the hospital on the southeastern outskirts of the Iraqi capital, as patients and their relatives tried to flee the building. "The majority of the victims died because they had to be moved and were taken off ventilators, while the others were suffocated by the smoke," the civil defence said. It told Iraqi state news its members had "rescued 90 people out of 120 patients and their relatives" at the scene, but could not give an exact number of the dead and wounded. Medical and security sources told AFP that 23 people had been killed and some fifty others injured in the blaze. The fire -- which according to several sources was caused by negligence, often linked to endemic corruption in Iraq -- immediately sparked anger on social media in the country, with a hashtag demanding the health minister be sacked trending on Twitter. Baghdad Governor Mohammed Jaber called on the health ministry "to establish a commission of enquiry so that those who did not do their jobs may be brought to justice". In a statement, the government's human rights commission said the incident was "a crime against patients exhausted by Covid-19 who put their lives in the hands of the health ministry and its institutions and instead of being treated, perished in flames". The commission called on Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi to fire Health Minister Hassan al-Tamimi and "bring him to justice". Kadhemi responded by calling for "an immediate investigation with those in charge at the ministry" and demanded that the "hospital director, head of security and the technical maintenance team be sent to the investigators and not be released until those at fault have been brought to justice". By the early hours of Sunday, while the civil defence said the fire was under control, the health ministry had not issued any statement or announced how many people had been killed or wounded. On Wednesday, the number of Covid-19 cases in Iraq surpassed one million, the highest of any Arab state. The health ministry has recorded 15,217 deaths since the country's first infections were reported in February 2020. It has said it carries out around 40,000 tests daily from a population of 40 million. Those patients who can often prefer to source oxygen tanks for treatment at home, rather than go to overcrowded and run-down hospitals. The country launched its vaccination campaign last month, and has received nearly 650,000 doses of different vaccines -- the majority by donation or through the Covax programme, which is helping lower and middle income nations to procure vaccines. As of Wednesday, 274,343 people had received at least one dose, the ministry said. Health authorities have faced an uphill battle to convince Iraqis to get vaccinated, in the face of widespread scepticism over the jab and public reluctance to wear masks since the start of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/at-least-23-dead-in-fire-at-baghdad-covid-hospital/articleshow/82238041.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Panic buying hits supply of antivirals, oximeters||GURUGRAM: Panic buying and hoarding has created a shortage of common medicines that are being increasingly used by Covid patients in home isolation. Not just drugs such as Fabiflu and Doxycycline, oximeters and vaporisers are also vanishing off the counters amid allegations that even those who do not have any symptoms are hoarding them at home. Chemists across the city said since a majority of patients were in home isolation, they were resorting to self-medication and following unverified information being circulated on social media. According to the Gurgaon chemist and druggist association (GCDA), recent restrictions imposed by the Delhi government on supply of medicines to other states had an effect on stocks in the city. “Earlier, we would get some of the antiviral drugs from Delhi. Now, we have been getting limited supply of medicines from Ambala and Panipat. This has hit the supply of drugs in our city,” said Sharad Mehrotra, president of the association. He added that panic buying also played a key role in creating the shortage. “Many people with mild symptoms or no symptoms at all are hoarding the medicines. Some of them are not even consulting a doctor,” Mehrotra said. The owner of a medicine shop in the city said the panic buying was also the result of unverified information being circulated on social media. “Many salts, including plain Zinc, Fabiflu, Favipiravir, Tamiflu, Doxycycline, Ivermectin and Vitamin C, are not available in the market because demand for these medicines exceeds the supply by far. The stocks of these medicines are fast running out,” said Jatin, owner of Gurunanak Medicos. Oximeters and vaporisers are also in short supply. Doctors said while oximeters help keep track of a person’s oxygen level, vaporisers help clear the airways and assist in breathing. Vitamins and zinc are important to keep the immunity at peak. The shortage has obviously led to black-marketing. “Oximeters and thermometers are selling at the rate of knots. Right now, I do not have oximeters in my shop. There is a good 60-70% shortage in supply. This was not the case last year,” said Satish Mittal, a medicine supplier in the city. Those who are in dire need of the medicines are bearing the brunt. “I had to go to at least 10 shops to buy a pack of Deksel syrup and Zincovit tablets,” said Surender Singh, who stays in Sector 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/panic-buying-hits-supply-of-antivirals-oximeters/articleshow/82236789.cms||Shahnawaz Alam

Meanwhile, the Gurugram administration has chalked out a plan to deal with any emergency situation, with the government increasing the district’s liquid oxygen quota to 35 tonnes from the existing 20 tonnes. At a review meeting on Saturday, additional chief secretary TC Gupta, who is in charge of Covid management for Gurgaon, directed the executive magistrates and nodal officers appointed for each hospital to strictly enforce the government orders and ensure that every medical facility provides beds for the specified number of Covid patients and “that the needy patients can get beds”. “I am in constant touch with senior officials of the Union government and the top management of the oxygen-producing companies to supply sufficient quantities of the life-saving gas to Gurgaon, so there is no need for anyone to panic about the supply,” Gupta said. Gurgaon’s deputy commissioner Yash Garg said that the district administration has prepared a contingency plan to deal with any emergency situation, after assessing the demand and supply of oxygen in city hospitals. “The plan also includes reserving 10 tonnes of oxygen for the city hospitals. The current crisis in the majority of the hospitals in the city is due to their private vendors, who have not assured the regular supplies of oxygen,” he said. At the meeting, MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh said about 100 beds have been arranged at SGT Medical College and 20 more will be added with oxygen and five with ventilators. “Efforts are being made to increase the number of beds in collaboration with corporates.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gurgaon-readies-an-oxygen-plan-as-hospitals-face-shortage/articleshow/82236930.cms||Akanksha Gupta
---||Chandigarh||TA model, youth as enablers in pandemic||The country is battling a health emergency triggered by the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic. Two years ago, during a talk on national security challenges, where the likelihood of a pandemic was flagged, students asked if a relatively minor threat was being overhyped? Should it even make it to the list? However, last year, just before the lockdown, while speaking at LPU, including in front of a large number of international students, it was easier to drive home the point that public health will indeed become an important component of Comprehensive National Power (CNP). Productivity and economy can be completely derailed by pandemics like Covid, with migrants deserting their jobs in sheer panic, thereby impacting GDP. We have to recalibrate our strategy for our productive cutting-edge population, euphemistically dismissed as ‘migrants’, in terms of housing, medical care (immunisation) and social security. Issues flagged last year, just after imposition of lockdown in the column titled ‘Covid-19: Time to Enhance Social Capital through Voluntary Compliance’ (https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/generals-jottings/covid-19-time-to-enhance-social-capital-through-voluntary-compliance/) seem to have become even more relevant. However, a year down the line, punctuated with the declaration of a premature victory, unnecessary boasting of imaginary biological immunity, coupled with some unscientific cures, we seem to have been caught completely unprepared. The task now appears daunting. At this stage, one can only pray, breed positivity and optimism. Hope we display belated self-restraint (through Covid-appropriate behavior) and legendary resilience. India has faced many pandemics, like cholera and smallpox, in last centuries and health emergencies, like Surat plague (1998) and Nipah Virus (2004), more recently. This pandemic, like Kargil war, has brought panic, hysteria and call for accountability, into our drawing rooms. The scale of this unfolding challenge is such that we need our social capital and communities to come to fore. China diabolically timed its Ladakh misadventure with unleashing of Wuhan virus. Hence, it was axiomatic that Armed Forces resorted to very rigorous and prolonged ‘locked-in’, in order to ensure force protection, to face possibility of conflict escalation. There is no stipulated template for lockdown or locked-in; consequently, different cantonments/stations had different norms for entry, canteens, golf and institutions like clubs. These naturally got compared and drew avoidable adverse comments. In the first wave, the Armed Forces, especially Air Force, played their part in logistics of evacuation, ferrying of medical equipment and drugs. Oxygen supply and transportation of mobile oxygenators seems to be a key concern currently. It is heartening that these generators will be used to boost infrastructure in service hospitals. There were lingering questions about static HQ area/sub-area network, transportation fleet and rolling stock. Could they have been utilised for mitigation of woes of migrants? Army had set up a Covid hospital and quarantine facility in Delhi. During the second wave, these facilities are not only being revived, but scope is being expanded to regional hotspots in states, utilising DRDO, DPSUs and OFB. It is a national emergency and a whole-of-nation approach, obviously, is the need of the hour specially when mandated agency, NDRF, has no real capability in this domain. Knee-jerk activation of hospitals validates that winding up of medical TA units, undertaken in 2014, destroying a 45-year-old legacy, as part of transformation, has been ill-advised tinkering. It is ironical that it happened soon after successful mega mobilisation steered by Maj Gen H K Singh, ADG TA. Civilian hospitals designated as general hospitals (GH) had TA component with approximately 3,000 beds, with capability to scale up pan-India spread. Bed capacities were: Kolkata (500), Allahabad (400), Jaipur (300), Patiala (300), Guwahati (300), Ahmedabad (300) and Rohtak (400). This concept needs to be revived as TA can be a key enabler for synergy in civil and military medical infrastructure for emergency response at nominal costs. Globally, the TA concept is being proliferated and it will be a good idea to revive it in public health domain with AIIMS and elite medical colleges driving the concept. The idea needs to be extended to DRDO, DPSUs and CAPFs, albeit to forces like CISF and RPF, instead of frontline BG forces ITBP and BSF. Setting up of a Covid hospital in Delhi by ITBP is bad optics and avoidable distraction for a force which is mandated as a first-responder against China. This synergy is especially relevant, when there is a distinct possibility of pathogens being unleashed as bio-weapons, in unrestricted warfare and war-like response may have to be invoked. Logistics infrastructure of Armed Forces needs to be seamlessly integrated with civilian infrastructure to achieve economy of effort and genuine ‘plug and play’. In Sikkim, an MoU with a Manipal hospital for 150 beds was signed, enabled by veterans heading the institution. Army has untapped bed capacities in few military hospitals. Hospitals also have adequate space for surge facilities in terms of tented/mobile hospitals. Mapping and linking of these with medical colleges, in vicinity needs to be done. While doing so, interests of veterans should be given primacy. It is indeed most unfortunate that a veteran brigadier could not receive treatment in Delhi. Hopefully, belated correctives will be applied, with empathy, to ensure timely care. During the first wave, despite medically proven evidence of relative immunity of youth, large strength of NCC, NSS and NYKS was not optimally tapped. The PM, in his recent address, asked youth to set up committees to lead the charge. It is time to reorient their training to meaningfully harness their potential. Immunised and trained volunteer youth have the potential to become citizen warriors or nagrik yodhas, helping in mitigation of national emergencies like conflicts and disasters including pandemics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ta-model-youth-as-enablers-in-pandemic/articleshow/82235999.cms||---

---||Amritsar||Covid rages on, so does farm protest||BATHINDA: The ongoing farmers protest on the borders of Delhi turned 150 days old on Saturday with no signs of fizzling out in near future, even as Covid-19 cases continued to rise in the national capital and across Haryana and Punjab. On both Singhu and Tikri borders between Delhi and Haryana, where the protests have been goining on against the three farm laws since November last year, farmers and unionists said they would not vacate protest sites simply over the rise in Covid cases. Farm leaders have been asking protesters not to fear Covid, but adopt precautions like wearing a mask and maintaining social distancing. The unionists have, in fact, started describing the latest Covid wave as “another failure of PM Narendra Modi government”. “Do not fear from coronavirus, but only use precautions as the central government is trying to use Covid to scare farmers. If coronavirus is so serious, why did the Prime Minister and Union home minister held big rallies in poll-bound West Bengal? As this protest is getting wider, the government is using lies to get it vacated,” said Balbir Singh Rajewal, a senior farm unionist while addressing a crowd at the Singhu border on Saturday. While heading for Delhi on November 26, 2020, farm groups had claimed that they had come prepared for camping on the state borders for at least six months and even more. Now, protesters are just a month away from that target, which has now been turned into a protest with no definite end date. Showcasing their ability to carry on for a longer time into the protests, farmers have set up semi-pucca structures at protest sites for the summer. BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan too tried to motivate protesters against Covid at Bahadurgarh’s Pakora Chowk near Tikri border. “We do not fear it (Covid) as we are hardworking people who have strong immunity. Corona or no corona, we will continue to fight for the repeal of farm laws. We will not return till we achieve our demand,” he said. Protesting farmers have faced near-zero-degree temperature during winter and say they are now ready to face the summer heat of May-June. So far, at least 300 protesters have died at the protest sites, with the average coming to two deaths each day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/150-days-on-and-amid-2nd-covid-wave-farm-protest-still-on/articleshow/82236022.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Amid oxygen shortage, NGOs step in to help residents||GURUGRAM: With the city’s healthcare system overwhelmed and many hospitals facing an acute shortage of oxygen, changemakers are helping desperate residents affected by Covid-19. One of them is Hemkunt Foundation, an NGO in Sector 42, which is helping people get oxygen cylinders for a refundable deposit of Rs 10,000. The NGO claims to be getting over 12,000 distress calls on a daily basis. Hemkunt has launched two separate projects — drive through and home delivery. For the drive through service run from a makeshift arrangement, they check the Covid report and oxygen status of patients. For home delivery, they ask for photos of a patient, their Covid report, Aadhaar card, and a recent picture of oxygen levels. To avoid any stocking of cylinders, they provide only one cylinder per patient. The charitable work of the NGO — which has already worked in various disaster management projects — is supported by crowdfunding and donations. “We started the service in February and at that time we were getting around 100 calls a day. In the past few weeks, the demand has shot up exponentially. We get about 12,000 calls every day. All plead for oxygen supply. We are able to cater to only 30% to 40% of the demand at the moment,” said Harteerath Singh, community development director at Hemkunt Foundation. The NGO has tied with a host of dealers and wholesalers in different states and import oxygen cylinders on a daily basis. “Our aim is to help people battle out the crucial couple of hours spent searching for hospital beds. We also help small nursing homes but don’t provide cylinders to big hospitals because they have their own supply chain,” Singh added. Another organisation, Khalsa Aid India, has also come forward to provide oxygen concentrators for free to Covid-19 patients in NCR. Launched on Friday evening, the organisation is already flooded with requests. To cater to the rising demand, they have released a WhatsApp helpline number — 9115609005. “The moment you click on this number, you’ll get a Google form. It will ask you about your details like on which date you got Covid positive, complete name and address, doctor’s prescription, and picture of oximeter reading. Preference is given to those with low oxygen levels and in critical condition,” said an office-bearer. Similarly, a gas plant in Manesar — Star Special Air Gases Private Limited — has started philanthropic work by providing refilling of oxygen cylinders for free. “We provide refilling of oxygen for free. If anybody charges anything, one can complain to us and we’ll take action. We aren’t doing it as part of any business but to help people during these terrible times that we are facing. All one has to do is get their empty cylinders and we’ll provide free and prompt refilling,” said Arjun, an official at the plant. On Saturday, however, one of its tankers was allegedly seized by officials in Rewari district and diverted to Panipat to get oxygen for Rewari. “We were compelled to arrange a private tanker from the market and it reached the factory around 8 pm,” said a company spokesperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/amid-oxygen-shortage-ngos-step-in-to-help-residents/articleshow/82237118.cms||Siddharth Tiwari

It is feared that the boat was involved in an accident involving a ship. The fate of the 11men on board, all from Vallavilai coastal village in Kanyakumari district, is unknown. A search has been launched for the missing men by fishermen in other boats. Fisheries department officials, fishermen bodies and relatives of the missing men have urged the government to conduct a search and rescue using choppers. It would take four to five days for the Navy or Coast Guard ship to reach the location that is far deep in the sea. ‘Mercedes’ (registration number IND - TN - 15 - MM - 4775) set off from Thengapattanam harbour on April 6. On Friday evening, the fishermen spoke with those on other boats in the vicinity through the wireless device, assistant director for fisheries J L Ajith Stalin told TOI. “Around 1pm on Saturday I got information through satellite phone from Jenson, the owner of the boat ‘Periyanayagi’ from our village, that they had come across the damaged remains of ‘Mercedes’. The cabin was found floating. The men, engine, store and other portions were missing,” boat owners association president of Vallavilai, A Dilip Jose said. The fishermen once again called Dilip to inform that they could spot only a few Aadhaar cards and broken portions of the boat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/mangled-remains-of-tamil-nadu-boat-found-off-goa-coast-11-missing/articleshow/82238103.cms||M K Ananth

Morcha volunteers were playing the role of Covid warriors on protest sites at Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur and Shahjahanpur to ensure smooth traffic, it claimed, adding emergency services were open at every border. In a meeting with Haryana government officials two days ago it was decided that barricades from one side of the road would now be removed. The farmers have removed obstacles and the vehicles coming or going to Delhi are not facing any problem on the part of the farmers although the Delhi Police had not yet removed the barricades, said morcha adding farmers were helping the Covid warriors reach the destination. The farm body, with the help of some social welfare organisations and doctors, was encouraging farmers for sanitation, distribution of masks and vaccination at the protest sites, it said. At Tikri border, a team led by Dr Sawaiman Singh, is reaching out to the farmers and urging them to take necessary precautions regarding the pandemic. Going by the death of many persons in Delhi due to lack of oxygen, the morcha urged the government to make arrangements of oxygen to save precious lives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/opened-one-side-of-roads-but-delhi-cops-yet-to-remove-barricades-skm/articleshow/82236163.cms||---

On a complaint by Col C B Rai, officer commanding at headquarters of 2 Corps, Ambala police lodged a case against an unknown person under Section 170 (impersonating a public servant) and 419 (cheating by personation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Ambala Cantonment police station. In his complaint, Col Rai said, “Around 10.30am, Col Amit Mohanne, commanding officer of 2 Corps Provost Unit, received a call on his official landline number from an Indian mobile number. The individual claimed himself to be Rahul, assistant director of IB from Ambala, and indulged in seeking military-related information. Col Amit shared my mobile number with the caller and asked him to contact for needful.” “At 11.34am, I received a call on my mobile from the same contact number and same individual. The caller started enquiring about movement of a particular Army unit after portraying himself as IB officer. I did not divulge any info, but requested the caller to visit the office. IB office Ambala was contacted to ascertain if any person named Rahul was posted as assistant director and found no such person of this designation was posted. Since the caller made deliberate calls to landlines and mobile with an aim to fleece military information, there is a requirement of establishing detailed identity of individuals. You are, therefore, requested to establish contact with the mobile subscriber and undertake to investigate accordingly while treating the matter most urgently,” said Col Rai in his complaint.

---||Chandigarh||Rift over Parliament march date deepens||BATHINDA: Differences came to fore among farm groups from Punjab and 40 organisations that are part of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha during back-to-back meetings, which continued till Friday evening. The bone of contention was the date for the proposed march to Parliament. While a few organisations wanted to proceed with the march, others wanted to wait till the Covid situation normalised. Heated exchanges were witnessed during the meeting of Punjab organisations and then in the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha meeting. Sources said a farm leader was made to tender an apology for trying to “force his viewpoint in the proceedings.” In a press release issued on April 19, Sanyukt Kisan Morcha had hinted at cancellation of the march. Farm leaders Ashish Mittal and Yogendra Yadav claimed that the plan had not been shelved but put on hold. On the other hand, BKU chief Gurnam Singh Charuni said it seemed that the proposal had been cancelled. A few youths also allegedly tried to heckle farm organisation BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan, who was gheraoed while he was sitting in the car outside the temporary office of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha at Singhu border. An angry Ugrahan recounted the incident on Saturday afternoon while addressing a large gathering at Bahadurgarh’s Pakora Chowk. Ugrahan blamed supporters of Deep Sidhu, Lakha Sidhana and farm leader Surjit Singh Phool for the incident. “Certain forces wanted to forcibly make farm groups announce the date for march towards Parliament to which many farm organisations did not agree going by the past experience of January 26,” Ugrahan said. He added, “even the taunt was flung that farmer leaders have gone weak and lost the courage to take on the Central government but it was decided by voice vote that the present situation was not conducive for the march, especially when the forces behind happenings of January 26 are not held fully accountable and there is no surety that such happenings will not be repeated.” Ugrahan said, “some forces getting money from foreign countries want the struggle to go as per their whims and fancies but this would weaken the movement and we have announced that we will not toe the line.” The youths tried to persuade BKU (Dakaunda) president Buta Singh Burjgill, vice-president Manjit Singh Dhaner and Punjab Kisan Union president Ruldu Singh Mansa to announce the date for the march, said Ugrahan. When contacted, Dhaner said that some issues had come to fore but not much could be elaborated on what happened.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rifts-emerge-among-farmers-bodies-over-march-to-parliament/articleshow/82236175.cms||Neel Kamal

Chief secretary Vini Mahajan said 71.48 lakh metric tonne (LMT) of 76.32 LMT wheat arrivals had already been procured. She said the figure for the corresponding period last year was 29.32 LMT arrivals and 27.32 LMT procurement. As many as 7 lakh of the total 10 lakh farmers have uploaded their documents on the DBT portal. She said 22,000 arhtiyas (commission agents) were earlier registered with the food and civil supplies department and payments were transferred into their bank accounts for making further payments to farmers. This year, payments are being directly transferred by the procurement agencies into the bank accounts of farmers. Principal secretary (food and civil supplies) K A P Sinha said there was no shortage of gunny bags in grain markets. He said there were initially some problems due to non-functioning of jute mills in Kolkata due to the ongoing assembly elections in the state. He said 14.2 crore gunny bags had already been used for packaging of wheat, besides one crore bags per day were being supplied to all the grain markets across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/93-wheat-procured-rs-7594cr-paid-to-farmers-punjab-top-officer/articleshow/82236202.cms||---

Authorities stated that efforts are on to nab the fifth prisoner who is probably roaming in Bikaner itself. On April 20, five prisoners had escaped from Nokha sub-jail. Police raising an alarm had sealed the district borders for some time. Also, Punjab police was asked to track the movements of the escaped prisoners. "The arrested inmates were identified as Anil, Suresh, Saleem and Mandeep. The fifth prisoner Ratiram is within the limits of Bikaner. Our teams are raiding places and we are hopeful of catching him too," said Preeti Chandra, SP, Bikaner. Saleem and Suresh were nabbed from Bhatinda in Punjab while Mandeep and Anil were caught from Bikaner itself. "Two of them were caught in association with Hanumangarh police. The arrested jail inmates are being interrogated to know details of their plan and also to find out if other prisoners were planning a similar escape," she added. Authorities said that eight prisoners had actually planned to flee following the incident of Phalodi jail break. "Eight prisoners were ready but three failed to climb the lofty wall of the jail and failed and five managed to escape," said a senior police officer. "The inmate identified as Anil had planned the jailbreak and had convinced others who accompanied him," the officer added. It was also found that after the jail break, the inmates divided themselves in two teams. "As per plan, two of them fled towards Punjab and three others scattered themselves in various cities of Bikaner district immediately after they escaped the jail," the officer said. District special team of Bikaner police raided the places to nab the fifth inmate who is still on the run. "We have got concrete clues on his whereabouts and he would be nabbed soon," the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaipur-4-of-5-prisoners-who-escaped-from-nokha-sub-jail-nabbed/articleshow/82238151.cms||---

Ashok Poplay, executive member of Bahadurke Textile and Knitwear Association, said, “The lockdowns in different states are resulting in huge cancellation of orders. Ideally, we should have suspended our production, but we are forced to carry on with it as we know that if we suspend production, our workers will go idle and might return to their home states even if we pay them wages till the production resumes.” Times ViewThe coronavirus turmoil has no doubt put businesses and industries under strain, but there is a need to evolve and look at the long-term perspective. The strategy of retaining the labour force is aligned with this view. The companies can take this a step forward by utilizing the employee resource to leverage their business by reframing their business models. The unit owners should also keep the employees in the loop about their plans as uncertainty too could fuel flight of labour.“And once they go back, they will return after months and our entire season will be jeopardised. Already there is lot of panic among workers on account of possible lockdowns and increase in Covid-19 cases. Only we know how we are managing to hold them back,” he said. Poplay said, “The markets where there is no lockdown yet too are reporting huge drop in sales and we do not know where to dispose of our stocks. Moreover, the silence maintained by the government on what is going to be the future course of action has further made the matters worse. As of now, we can do nothing except for bearing the losses and investing our money with no surety of return.” Narinder Mittal, general secretary of Ludhiana Business Forums, said, “The situation is getting bad to worse for the garment industry. On a daily basis, new states are joining the list of imposing curbs, including lockdown, giving us a big blow. Already with two major markets of Delhi and Maharashtra under lockdown, another big garment consumer state Rajasthan too has now imposed lockdown for a fortnight.” “Given such high cancellations, the need of the hour is to shut down production for a fortnight, but we can not take this risk as once the labour is gone, we know fact that they will not return for months. So the best we could do right now is ending the overtime and operate only one shift of eight hours to keep our workers engaged,” he said. Narinder Bhamra, president of Fasteners Manufacturers Association of India, said, “Cancellations and orders on hold combined with continued production despite no sales have led to blockage of huge amount of our capital in finished goods. If this trend continues for two-three weeks, the situation will be beyond our control as we will be left with no funds to buy raw material or even manage our expenses.” “We do not know how to solve this situation as this is unprecedented. Last year lockdown was pan India and if we were closed, our dealers and buyers were also closed, but now its altogether a different story,” Bhamra added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/as-losses-mount-industries-go-slow-on-production/articleshow/82236214.cms||Mohit Behl

TOI had earlier reported how the Gaur Saundaryam society in Greater Noida (west) had formed a temporary isolation centre in their premises where they have kept oxygen cylinders, oximeters and they are extending help to the Covid patients with immediate medical advice from doctors available in the society. The Homes 121 society in Sector 121 is the latest to come up with such an arrangement or an “emergency Covid-19 response centre” where a group of residents have gathered and are helping out patients in their society with the assistance in getting a hospital bed or oxygen cylinders. Abhay Pandey, who is recovering from Covid himself told TOI that a group of volunteers — mostly former Covid patients — are extending help to the Covid patients in the society which has over 130 Covid cases. Members of resident bodies like FONRWA have suggested that the existing infrastructure in Gautam Budh Nagar like the four huge inter colleges and their hostels be converted into isolation centres or space be provided here to cook food for patients in their mess. Trilok Sharma, FONRWA patron, told TOI that the hostels of the Gautam Budh University and hostels of the four inter colleges in Noida and Greater Noida can be used as temporary Covid hospital facilities and only preparation would have to be done for oxygen and staff as facilities like beds and toilets were already present there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/use-gbu-inter-colleges-as-isolation-centres/articleshow/82236297.cms||Shikha Salaria

Official data showed only 16 oxygen beds and one ICU bed were available. TOI called up 10 different hospitals in the city and found no Covid bed available. Most of the hospitals said they already have a waiting list of patients and can’t admit any new ones. Calls to the CMO helpline 0124-2322412 weren’t received. As per the data gathered from the covidggn.com portal, one ICU bed was vacant at Vardaan hospital on Saturday evening, but no ventilator bed was available till the time of filing this report. The oxygen beds available include 11 at Medeor Hospital, three at Signature Hospital and one each at Kamla and Vardaan hospitals. Aashish Mudgil, a resident of Sector 47 made around 15 calls to city-based hospitals for his 70-year-old father who has Covid and diabetes on Saturday. “Everywhere I called, ICU and ventilator beds were full. I was asked to register my name and number so that I can be informed when a bed gets vacant,” he said. Dr Kartar Singh Yadav, state organising secretary, IMA (Haryana chapter), said Covid patients from Delhi and other parts of NCR are coming to Gurgaon and other adjoining districts in Haryana to get oxygen beds. “We have appealed to our members to add as many beds as possible. We also request bigger hospitals that have not admitted Covid patients so far to earmark a few beds to tackle the rush,” he added. In a recent order, all city hospitals were directed to ensure that 75% of their ICU and ventilator beds and 60% beds in the general category are reserved for Covid patients. Deputy commissioner Dr Yash Garg said, “We can take over the ESI hospital in Manesar and a community centre adjoining it to set up a facility of 150 beds there.” Meanwhile, Gurgaon’s tally of active cases rose to 23,046 on Saturday. Out of this, 22,015 patients are in home isolation. The positivity rate stood at 25% on the day. Health department officials said that eight people died of Covid, taking the toll to 418. At present, the case fatality rate is 0.4%. With 842 recoveries reported on Saturday, the total number of recoveries increased to 76,410. The recovery rate stands at 76.5%. As many 4,319 people had tested positive for Covid on Thursday, in what is so far the district’s sharpest single-day spike in cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/gurgaon-adds-over-3k-cases-again-but-where-are-hospital-beds/articleshow/82236305.cms||Vishakha Chaman

---||Gurgaon||Free meals: How religious places are helping patients in Gurugram||GURUGRAM: With Covid-19 cases on the rise, various religious organisations in the city have come forward to provide food service to those infected free of cost. Religious institutions like Gurdwara Sadh Sangat in South City-1 and Iskcon Temple in Sector 67 have started community kitchens and are providing food deliveries to those who are in home isolation and can’t arrange meals. The gurdwara has posted messages about its food service on social media groups and also provided a helpline number. “We decided to start a free food service for families that have been infected and are unable to get healthy food. We will be supplying two meals a day, which includes lunch and dinner consisting of pulses, vegetables, rice and chapattis. We started the service on Saturday and got 25 requests for lunch and over 65 requests for dinner,” said JS Gujral, secretary of the gurdwara. Meals are cooked by sewadaars and sangat of the gurdwara and will be distributed by volunteers within a distance of 5km. “Last year too, we were providing food rations to the needy and migrant labourers during the lockdown. Helping those in need is part of the culture and ethos of gurdwaras,” Gujral added. Iskcon temple began a similar initiative, “Covid Food Aid”, on Thursday. “On the first day, about 50 meals were delivered, the number rose to 257 on the second day and 380 meals were served the third day. Meals are being delivered by Iskcon members within a 10km radius,” said Padsevan Bhakt Das, communication head of Iskcon Gurgaon. A total of 20 volunteers are involved in the initiative, including 10 young monks, three of whom are engineering graduates. There is also a certified dietician in the team, who has been selecting the menu to ensure nutritious and tasty food for Covid patients. Iskcon is also in talks with a number of hyper-local delivery services so that the deliveries can be made even in areas which are more than 10km away. “We can make up to 2,000 meals a day, but it is the delivery part that is limiting our expansion of service. If we get help in delivery, we can easily make meals reach every part of city,” Das added.  With information on the initiatives being circulated in social media groups, many families who are infected with Covid are availing these services. “The initiative is a blessing as I am still recovering from Covid and it isn’t possible to cook. We appreciate their endeavour to provide such healthy meals right at our doorsteps,” said Shweta Singh, a resident of Sector 65 who has availed of Iskcon’s food service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/free-meals-how-religious-places-are-helping-patients/articleshow/82236319.cms||Akanksha Gupta

The property dealer’s son also sustained bullet injuries in the attack and is undergoing medical treatment at a hospital. Panic prevailed across the city following the firing prompting senior police officers including IG Kota Range Ravi Dutt Gour and FSL teams to rush to the spot after the incident. The property dealer was identified as Balraj Singh Jadon. Four men reached the property dealer’s home in a car and after a brief exchange of words shot him dead, Kota city ASP Rajesh Meel said. Two bullets hit Jadon’s younger son who sustained injuries in his waist and thigh. He underwent a surgery on Friday night and his condition is stated to be out of danger, he added. The miscreants were likely to have used a countrymade pistol, he added. Three of the accused involved in the firing were identified as Harish Meena, Banti Vardhan and Narendra, Meel said, adding Harish and Banti are sharp shooters of Bhanu Gang. The ASP, however, refuted the association with the gang and said two of the three identified accused are notorious history sheeters of the area. Prima facie, a dispute over property and extortion by the accused were likely to be the reason behind the crime, he said. The police lodged a case of murder against the accused and attempts are underway to nab them, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/4-men-shoot-dead-property-dealer-in-kota-son-also-injured-in-attack/articleshow/82238180.cms||---

In an order issued on April 21, the state home department said, “In view of the decision that there should be a weekend curfew imposed from Friday evening to Monday morning, we have also taken the decision that no factories, cottage industry or small-scale industry will be stopped from operating during these days.” The order was issued by additional chief secretary (home) Awanish K Awasthi. However, Rajiv Bansal, president of the Indian Industries Association (IIA), said that the attendance of workers in factories has been steadily going down over the past few days. “We are following the government order and work is in progress, however, the attendance has dropped drastically. We have less than 50% people working in various factories, and it may further go down in the days to come.” The IIA had earlier appealed to the state government to prioritise the vaccination of factory workers, and that too, free of cost. “If industries have to run optimally, the workforce will have to be given a safe environment, and many are leaving out of sheer fear,” Bansal added. Members of Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) said they have already urged the Union government to counsel the migrant workers to stay back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/msmes-operating-with-50-workforce/articleshow/82236326.cms||Sharmila Bhowmick
---||Noida||From Apr 1-23, over 1k Covid cremations in city||Noida: Between April 1 and 23, when the official death toll inflicted by the Covid-19 pandemic stood at 137 in Gautam Budh Nagar, there were 1,185 cremations following Covid protocols at the two CNG furnaces in Antim Niwas, the crematorium’s records show. The two CNG furnaces at the crematorium in Noida’s Sector 94 are being used solely for Covid patients. Crematorium managers said most bodies were brought there from hospitals in Gautam Budh Nagar, and about 25% were from hospitals in neighbouring NCR districts like Ghaziabad, Bulandshahr, Meerut, Mathura, Gurgaon, Faridabad, etc. Cremation of Covid patients is being carried out using traditional ways too. This data is not captured in the number of cremations at the two CNG furnaces. Non-Covid cremations are also taking place at Antim Niwas, on the platforms meant for pyres. From April 1 to 4pm on April 23, the number of people afflicted with Covid cremated in one of the CNG furnaces at Antim Niwas was 729. In the other furnace, there were 456 cremations in the same period. “We are cremating only Covid patients in the two existing CNG furnaces. However, some Covid patients are also being cremated using traditional ways when the furnaces are occupied or the family wants to perform the rituals,” an Antim Niwas official told TOI. Till about two days back, no family was turned away, irrespective of the location of the hospital from where the bodies came. “But we are overburdened now, and families of patients being brought from other districts are being discouraged,” another Antim Niwas official told TOI. “The situation is dismal,” said an Antim Niwas worker. “People are coming here but there is no space for the pyres. So, they are cremating their loved ones in whatever little space they find between the platforms.” Only Antim Niwas has CNG furnaces in the district. Asked how the crematorium ascertains if Covid protocols are to be followed for a deceased, Mahesh Saxena of Lok Manch – the NGO which runs Antim Niwas that is owned by the Noida Authority – said they go by the Covid report and hospital documents. “The families come with the Covid reports and reports of the cause of death. At times, there are patients who tested positive before death but at the time of death, the report was negative,” he said. Covid protocols are followed in such cases as well. Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that many of the deaths were being cross-notified to other districts and state surveillance officers. “In most districts, if you compare the data of deaths and the records of cremation grounds, you will find a difference,” he said. “Initially, there used to be testing of dead bodies, but later, it was directed that all bodies should be cremated as per Covid norms and officials should not wait for the Covid report. At the cremation ground, you don’t know which body falls in which category. Hospitals and laboratories are handling the data since the data has been decentralised, unlike conspiracy theories that the data may be under-reported. Further, many cases would be removed from the portal because at the time of death, the deceased became non-Covid,” the DM added. Suhas admitted that there could be one category of Covid deaths that “could not be captured”. “Another category can be those who came from outside the district. Those which came for tertiary care here from outside and died at a Covid hospital, that can be another category,” he said. With crematoriums getting swamped, the Noida Authority has issued an order that people should use the cremation ground nearest to them. On Friday, Ram Kishore Sharma and his relatives struggled to find space to conduct the last rites of his 66-year-old relative Giriraj Kishore Sharma. “We were told that since we have come from a Greater Noida hospital, the body will not be cremated here. We were charged Rs 15,000 by the ambulance service that transported the body to Antim Niwas. The package included the cost of the logs too but now we don’t know how to go about the cremation,” he said. The family eventually took the body to Shafipur cremation ground. A Noida Authority official told TOI two more gas furnaces were being set up. “Besides, as many as 24 platforms are being constructed in the vacant space inside Antim Niwas where funerals can happen the traditional way,” the official said. Noida Authority general manager PK Kaushik confirmed an LPG furnace was being rented to support the two existing furnaces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/from-apr-1-23-over-1k-covid-cremations-in-city/articleshow/82236344.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Gurgaon||In pandemic, can positivity be embraced only by a select few?||By Babita BaruahTwo things happened recently that prompted me to write this piece. I chanced upon a friend’s observation on positivity and how in such times, it’s an emotion that can be embraced only by a select few. It may be futile to even mention it in today’s context. He is right in many ways. It is easy to talk about positivity and optimism. Tough to walk the talk, with the world reeling in the wake of the pandemic. I received a text message from a senior colleague in response to something I had shared — “the only way is through”. The effect these few words had on me were remarkable and led me to introspection. Fear stalls us Anxiety is an overriding state of mind for most of us today. With good reason, as we face an ongoing onslaught, with winds of uncertainty and unimaginable change. But when anxiety morphs into fear, it impacts our thinking and action. Like the deer caught in the headlights, whose inevitable end could have changed with just two or three long leaps it is more than capable of. Most of the breakthroughs in business have happened as innovative solutions to a collective mental conflict, when people behind these solutions have overcome their own doubts, fear of failure or repercussions. Devoid of this spirit, we fall prey to leaning on comfort pillars. We look for opinions and viewpoints from friends, family, peers and increasingly on digital media. This deluge of opinions can cloud our thoughts and enhance our vulnerability even more. On the work front, at times, consumer research findings are applied in absolute and not in the true spirit, as it can be a rationale to support a decision or solution. The famous quote from an automobile pioneer, “if I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses”, alludes to this. ‘I’ve got your back’ A senior client said this to us one day over a creative solution that was on the edge. We went ahead with strength and conviction. The work raised some questions from key stakeholders. True to his words, the client stood up and took complete accountability. We cannot expect anyone to overcome doubt and fear, if we don’t have their back. Fear sweeps us when we feel a sense of abandonment or being pushed to the frontline without any backup. The responsibility here falls square centre on leaders. Parents, family seniors, experienced friends, leadership in organisations, governing bodies and authorities. Think versus feel Again, easier said than done. We are wired to feel. Emotions have a profound impact on our actions. Personally, I have always been an exponent of heart over mind, when it comes to instinctive action. But over time, I have realised that emotions can also potentially cloud our judgement. The “Emotion Bias” is sometimes not our own doing but a legacy. Thinking with logic, weighing facts, authentic sources of information can help us balance out some of the emotional quotient. We see this in our life context. One of the mentorship programmes I am involved in recommends a personal strength, weakness and opportunity audit. When we put pen down to paper, we discover hidden truths about ourselves. I have tried this many times and have marvelled at the outcome. In marketing, data is increasingly playing a role. There are questions on whether over focus and dependence on data is coming at the cost of creative solutions, hampering innovation and pioneering thinking. It’s the proverbial knife in our hands — we can choose to use it for our good or otherwise. Technology has made data real time and accessible, we have the ability to understand people’s behaviour, key drivers, detractors and what could propel action and relevance. Using it in the right context will lead to optimisation of resources and growth. The power of silence Silence not only speaks louder than words, as the saying goes, but gives us time to evaluate. One of the cons of social media, in my opinion, is the compulsion to express, share a view, react and respond. Unconsciously, we may end up fuelling our own internal fires. It also eats into our time. When I first started my professional journey, one of the encouragements we received was to express ourselves. Not hold back. I share this with many women today as well. But I have also started qualifying this to separate and filter out unwarranted noise versus conversations that leave us in a better place, however small. Keep the faith Five decades of life have taught me that there will always be questions unanswered. The best laid plans can be disrupted by change. In the midst of this all, life has to go on. Keeping the faith, no matter what, has helped me manage and navigate some very tough challenges and overcome deep personal loss. Because the only way, indeed, is through.

On Friday, over 50 bodies were cremated. Officials at the crematorium said at least 550 bodies have been cremated since April 1. The deceased included many who succumbed to Covid-related complications. The relatives of 21-year-old Yashika, who succumbed to the infection at the AIIMS in Delhi, were waiting in the queue at the crematorium since early morning. Her brother Deepak told TOI that their token number was 47, but by afternoon 45 bodies were cremated. “My sister was admitted to AIIMS with kidney-related complications on Friday and even though her corona report was negative, she was admitted to the Covid ward. She died later in the night and we came to Hindon cremation ground with her body in our car early on Saturday morning. It’s already afternoon and we are still waiting for our turn to cremate the body,” Deepak said. Deepak remained in his car with the body of his sister wrapped in a white sheet. “We could not even return to our home in Govindpuram, we are just waiting for our turn, my token number is 47,” he added. The crematorium is also staring at a shortage of wood required for the funeral pyre. The management of the crematorium said there are just 5,000 quintals of wood left that will last for just a week. “The situation is worse than what we experienced in April last year. So far, 550 bodies have been cremated this month,” said Pandit Manish Sharma in charge of Hindon Moksh Dham.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/crematorium-at-hindon-flooded-with-bodies/articleshow/82236367.cms||Abhijay Jha
---||Raipur||Police officer abducted and murdered by Maoists in Bastar||RAIPUR: Maoists have murdered a police officer they had abducted from his village in Bastar’s Bijapur district four days ago. SI Murli Tati, who was on medical leave, is the third off-duty cop to be killed by Maoists in less than 10 days in Bastar. Since the Maoists had held him hostage for a few days, there was hope that he would be released or rescued. But his body was found on the outskirts of a village, not far from his own, early Saturday morning. A note left by Maoists on his body said the decision to murder him had been taken at a ‘jan adalat’ because he had ‘dared to join the forces’ and had killed many PLGA cadres. Unlike the kidnapping of CoBRA commando Rakeshwar Singh Manhas, there was no public appeal from rights activists for Tati’s release. The officer’s wife had appealed to the Maoists to spare him, saying: “My husband’s mental state isn't good. He left home without saying anything. I am hoping that people will help me and request Maoists to release my husband. I also appeal to Maoists to free him. I need to get him treated.” She fell unconscious when his body was brought in on Saturday. SI Tati was with District Reserve Guards (DRG) — a unit of local tribals that spearheads operations against Maoists. He had gone on medical leave to his village, Palnar in Gangaloor, barely 20km through jungle paths from the site of the April 3 ambush in which 22 security personnel were massacred. Tati was kidnapped by Maoists on April 21, said Bijapur SP Kamlochan Kashyap. While police were trying to trace the father of three, some local journalists went into the forest in search of him on Friday but there was no sign of him, nor any information from villagers. Police were trying to set up a team of local organizations for mediation, but the Maoists killed him. According to police sources, Tati had joined the forces during the final days of the Salwa Judum movement in 2011 and was on the target of Naxals for a long time. Maoists had named him on leaflets several times, warning him to quit the forces. They also said that Tati had gunned down PLGA cadres and was carrying out operations against them. The Maoist leaflet, weighed down by a stone on Tati’s body, said he had been killed because he didn’t heed their repeated warnings to quit DRG. His abduction had come only a day after Maoists accused security forces of using drones to ‘bomb’ their camps, a charge that police and CRPF have strongly denied. Maoists are on the rampage in Bastar this month. After killing 22 jawans in an ambush on April 3, they have murdered over seven people, including a 15-year-old boy and three off-duty cops, in less than two weeks||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/police-officer-abducted-and-murdered-by-maoists-in-bastar/articleshow/82238229.cms||---

The hospital currently has 105 patients and has stopped admitting new ones. The hospital management added that all critical patients are undergoing treatment. The move comes after the district administration issued fresh guidelines to all private hospitals on Saturday. The guidelines mentioned that a hospital should not admit any Covid patient if they do not have oxygen supply. All private hospitals will be monitored, and action will be taken against them in case of non-compliance of order. District magistrate Suhas LY on Saturday visited multiple hospitals to take stock of the situation. Ayush Chauhan, director of Prakash Hospital, said, “Our agent has let us down despite a standing contract. It is probably because they are based in Faridabad and their supplies have been diverted to Haryana. We have discharged a few patients and are attending to those who are critical. As of now, we have completely stopped new admission.” While Noida Authority has continued its sanitation drive through the city, authority officials informed that the city’s urinals and public conveniences will not be closed during the weekend lockdowns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/no-oxygen-prakash-hospital-starts-discharging-patients/articleshow/82237483.cms||Sharmila Bhowmick

---||Gurgaon||‘Told patients’ kin to beg, borrow or steal’: Jittery hospitals on oxygen edge in Gurugram||GURUGRAM: After Fortis on Thursday and Artemis on Friday, it was Max and Mayom on Saturday that sent out oxygen SOSs as they faced the frightening scenario of running out with just two hours of supplies left. Mayom officials said they were forced to request patients’ families to arrange for oxygen cylinders themselves. It triggered another scramble in the district administration to rush oxygen to these hospitals. With assurances of adequate oxygen supply not translating into reality, hospitals have themselves become a bundle of nerves as the pandemic spirals to new peaks daily. Max Hospital sent out a tweet at 11.20am. “SOS — less than 2 hours’ oxygen supplies at Max Hospital Gurugram... Over 70 Covid patients admitted. Supplies expected at 10am diverted,” the tweet said. It was followed by an appeal by Mayom Hospital at 11.43am. “Dear @cmohry @mlkhattar — urgent SOS help needed. We are running out of oxygen. Reached a situation where we are forced to shift ventilators between critical patients. Losing battle if we don’t get urgent supply,” the hospital tweeted. Update: We received our oxygen supplies. A huge thanks to @cmohry @dc_gurugram @anilvijminister @mlkhattar… https://t.co/h4d4InJED7— Max Healthcare (@MaxHealthcare) 1619257167000Max said it was provided with 1.5 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen by the district administration around 3pm. “Update: We received our oxygen supplies. A huge thanks to @cmohry @dc_gurugram @anilvijminister @mlkhattar @gurgaonpolice @drharshvardhan @pmoindia @piyushgoyal for the promptness and for creating a green corridor to get this supply in time,” it tweeted. Mayom, on the other hand, said it hadn’t received any oxygen from the authorities.  “We are struggling to get the next batch of cylinders and are dependent on private players for oxygen. The administration has only given us verbal assurances, but there is no consistent source of supply. We have more than 80 Covid patients, including 20 ICU patients and 10 on ventilators. We have been compelled to send attendants of patients to beg, borrow or steal and somehow get oxygen,” said Dr Manish Prakash, medical superintendent, Mayom. District administration officials said the main problem is that most of the private firms providing oxygen to hospitals have cut off supply, due to which the hospitals were approaching the government for oxygen. Gurugram has been allocated 35 MTof oxygen a day at present.  Deputy commissioner Dr Yash Garg said the demand was fluctuating daily depending on the number of critical patients and Haryana has requested the Centre to increase their allocation of oxygen. “The allocation for the state is 127 MT and I believe we will be getting 162 MT from Sunday. With Haryana’s quota increasing, Gurugram’s quota for oxygen will also increase.” Meanwhile, other city hospitals also raised concerns over oxygen supplies running out. A doctor tweeted that patients were being given oxygen at low pressure to maximise the time oxygen remained available.  “We received our main supply from a private firm on Friday. Two smaller bridging supplies were given by the administration. The current supply will last till Sunday evening. We will bank on private supply to refill our cylinders every alternate day,” said a spokesperson for Artemis Hospital. “We are seeing a huge surge in Covid patients requiring oxygen support in the last fortnight. We were to get our daily supply from INOX Bhiwadi, however, our supply has been deeply affected and delayed in the last few days. The government has issued orders to the plant to fulfil our requirements. We hope that with this order, supply will be streamlined now,” said Dr Ritu Garg, zonal director, Fortis Memorial Research Institute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/told-patients-kin-to-beg-borrow-or-steal-jittery-hospitals-on-oxygen-edge/articleshow/82236729.cms||Vishakha Chaman
