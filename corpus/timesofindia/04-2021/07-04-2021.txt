---||Goa||FC Goa coach Juan Ferrando still undecided on foreign players for ACL||Panaji: FC Goa coach Juan Ferrando finds himself with a big headache ahead of Thursday’s deadline for finalising the squad for AFC Champions League. Although seven are allowed to be registered in the Indian Super League, Goa signed only six foreigners, just like they did the previous season. However, as per AFC regulations, a team can field only four foreigners -- which includes one from the AFC member country – in Asian competitions. “Of course, it is a difficult decision,” Ferrando told TOI in an online interaction on Tuesday. “More a less in my mind we are thinking everyday, but tomorrow night or last moment, we decide the best players because at the end the big problem is we play six games in 20 days and it is a difficult decision.” Australian centre-back James Donachie is an automatic choice. Ferrando has to take a tough call to choose three from the five Spanish players. Captain Edu Bedia is the club’s longest-serving foreigner and was part of the squad that earned the right to participate in Asia’s premier club competition. Ivan Gonzalez is firm in defence as well as dangerous moving forward. Jorge Ortiz and Alberto Noguera provide versatility in midfield with their creativity, while forward Igor Angulo has proved his worth winning the Golden Boot award this season. “It is a difficult moment because they play hard even in training. Rule exists in Asian Champions League and it is difficult. They love the club, they are hard-working, but this is life of football,” said the Spanish coach who recently recovered from Covid-19. Goa knows how challenging it will be against the best teams in Asia. They have been clubbed alongside last year’s runnersup Persepolis (Iran), Qatar Stars League outfit Al-Rayyan and the winner of the playoff between Al-Wahda (UAE) and Al-Zawraa (Iraq). The only advantage for Goa is that they will host the group E matches from April 14 at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda. They face Al-Rayyan in their opening match the same day. Ferrando is optimistic. “At the end, our way is the same, to prepare the team in attack, defence. This is our plan, our psychology, philosophy. But it is necessary to explain about lot of details because we play against very good squads, against very good teams. “The players have a lot of quality, but I believe in my team. I trust in my squad and at the end my job is to help in plans and be competitive,” he said. Goa will be happy with the return of midfielder Brandon Fernandes who missed most part of the season due to injury. January arrivals Glan Martins, Adil Khan, Amarjit Singh and goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh have given Ferrando options, while there are many more players like Makan Chote and Phrangki Buam who are waiting in the wings. Goa might find it difficult to cope up with the reduced number of foreign players, but Ferrando has ensured the clubs philosophy will remain the same in the competition. “I think it is not necessary to talk about tactical, but talk about focus because in 90 minutes it is necessary not to relax. Because in just a second the game can change,” said Ferrando.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-coach-juan-ferrando-still-undecided-on-foreign-players-for-acl/articleshow/81938372.cms||FLAVIO LOPES
---||India||Major reason for surge in cases is laxity in following Covid-appropriate behaviour: Union health minister Harsh Vardhan||NEW DELHI: Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Tuesday said one of the major reasons for the surge in cases was people becoming lax towards following Covid-appropriate behaviour and urged them take up mass awareness campaigns to re-instill the importance of such measures among the masses. Vardhan, who reviewed the Covid-19 situation and progress of vaccination in Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab and Rajasthan, said these 11 states together contributed 54 per cent of the total cases and 65 per cent of the total deaths in the country, with a disproportionately high number of deaths in Maharashtra and Punjab. A high test positivity rate was being seen in Maharashtra (25 per cent) and Chhattisgarh (14 per cent), he said, according to a health ministry statement. Vardhan noted that since February, these states have witnessed a steep increase in cases, majority of which have been reported in the younger population of 15-44 years, the ministry said in a statement. Also, it was pointed out that majority of the deaths have been reported among those over 60 years. Vardhan appreciated the increase in tests in the last four weeks but cautioned against the high RAT proportion in Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra. Another worrisome aspect pointed out was that the testing capacity of the private sector was underutilised in these states, the statement said. Meanwhile, he applauded states across the country for the collaborative work that they have put in for the collective gains till now. The Centre has been supporting and will continue to support states and UTs through all possible recourses to fight the global pandemic, he assured them. Vardhan said that while cases were on the rise since the past few weeks, the national cumulative fatality rate (CFR) was 1.30 per cent now. India's vaccination coverage crossed 8.31 crore doses, with single largest vaccination in a span 24 hours being more than 43 lakh doses administered. The total number of tests has surpassed 25 crore on Tuesday, he said. "From one lab at NIV, Pune, we now have 2,443 diagnostic labs across the country. Our testing capacity has escalated to 13,00,000 per day," he said. Vardhan said that India has also supported the global community through Vaccine Maitri, under which 6.45 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been exported to 84 countries. As many as 3.58 crore doses have been supplied to 25 nations under commercial contracts, and 1.05 crore to 43 countries as grants, he said. The health minister chaired a comprehensive and detailed review of COVID cases, vaccination status and challenges being faced by the states in management of coronavirus. He highlighted that a large part of the reason for the surge in cases in almost all parts of the country, more specifically in these 11 states, was that people had adopted lax behaviour towards following Covid norms. "It seems that people have given 'tilanjali' to measures and steps that can protect them from Covid such as mask wearing, avoiding gatherings and maintaining physical distance, which I have called social vaccine and are as important as the vaccines that we now have," Vardhan was quoted as saying in the statement. He urged states to take up mass awareness campaigns to re-instill the importance of measures in the masses. "It is only with a Jan Andolan and Jan Bhagidari that we shall be able to overcome this phase of high rise in cases in the country," the minister said. Vardhan reminded state health ministers that "the measures to prevent and contain Covid-19 are not rocket science. We have successfully adopted these measures all of last year and shown the world our success story". He said the same measures have to be reinforced and implemented with more rigour and commitment by states and people. They form the fundamental pillars of the fight against Covid-19, he added. In order to curb the resurgence of the pandemic, Vardhan advised states to strengthen their public and private healthcare resources. The limiting of social and public gatherings, implementation of "test, track, treat" strategy with 70 per cent RT-PCR ratio, quarantine of positive cases, contact tracing of at least 25 to 30 contacts per positive person were also stressed upon, the statement added. Speaking on the need to enhance the pace of vaccination, Vardhan assured everyone that the Centre will continually replenish the vaccine stock and exhorted states to vaccinate the prioritised groups in a mission mode. "There is no vaccine shortage in any part of the country. The Centre is providing the required quantities to all states and UTs," he stated. State health ministers shared a brief snapshot of the actions taken for containment, surveillance and treatment of Covid positive cases along with best practices of their states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/major-reason-for-surge-in-cases-is-laxity-in-following-covid-appropriate-behaviour-union-health-minister-harsh-vardhan/articleshow/81938502.cms||---

Those injured include wildlife protection official Dildar Khan, a wildlife department helper Ranjeet Katoch and an 80-year-old resident Ganga Ram. A wildlife official said, “A leopard was spotted by locals in the Green Belt Park and they immediately informed the police. By the time police and wildlife department teams reached the spot, the animal had already injured one person.” It took almost three hours for wildlife officials to capture the beast. The leopard became an attraction for curious passersby who were seen capturing videos on their mobile phones despite repeated appeals by authorities to disperse for their own safety, officials said, adding that it further agitated the animal. Police had to halt traffic on the adjoining roads to keep people away. Jammu wildlife warden Anil Attri said, “We received a call about the presence of a leopard in Gandhi Nagar area around 11.30am and rescue teams were rushed with tranquiliser guns and cages. The leopard was finally shifted to Manda Zoo around 2pm after being tranquilised.” Wildlife officials claimed that the leopard had ventured into the city from the nearby forest last week and was spotted in the Bahu Fort area of Jammu city after which people in the locality and adjoining areas were asked to remain cautious.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/leopard-injures-3-before-being-captured-from-jammus-posh-area/articleshow/81938809.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

This was the fastest 1lakh rise in active cases since the outbreak of the pandemic, with the count rising by a record 54,000 on Tuesday alone. The previous fastest increase in active cases across 1 lakh milestones was three days, recorded twice during the ongoing second wave. Daily cases hit another new peak with 1,15,249 fresh infections being reported on Tuesday, beating Sunday's record high of 1,03,844, when India had become the second country after the US to log over 1 lakh Covid-19 cases in a day.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); There were 630 deaths from the virus in the country in the last 24 hours, the highest single-day toll since November 5. Such has been the surge in the pandemic over the past few weeks that the count of active cases has gone from 2 lakh to over 8 lakh in just 24 days. The corresponding rise in active cases during the first wave had taken 66 days. On Tuesday, at least 16 states reported their biggest daily counts of new cases since at least December last year. Chhattisgarh was among three states that reported their highest ever sin gle-day rise in cases. Chhattisgarh added 9,921 fresh cases, becoming the second state after Maharashtra to cross the 9,000 mark. Madhya Pradesh with 3,722 new infections and Gujarat with 3,280, also posted their highest ever daily counts. Maharashtra, by far the worst hit by the virus, logged 55,469 new cases, its second highest daily count after Sunday’s count of over 57,000.

---||India||Supreme Court, high courts flouted norms on judge appointments: Government||NEW DELHI: Cornered by the Supreme Court for delaying appointment of high court judges, the Union government on Tuesday hit back and accused the SC and HCs of flagrantly breaching the memorandum of procedure (MoP) which mandates initiation of process for appointment of judges six months before a post falls vacant. The MoP is a written understanding between the judiciary and the executive on appointment of constitutional court judges. Sources in the department of justice told TOI, “As on March 26, out of 410 vacancies of judges, HC collegiums have not made recommendations for 214 posts, or in 52% of posts.” On March 27, a bench of CJI S A Bobde and Justices S K Kaul and Surya Kant had asked attorney general K K Vengupal to explain on April 8 why the government was sitting over 45 names recommended by HC collegiums for appointment as HC judges for periods ranging from six to 14 months and not sending them to the SC collegium for scrutiny. Justice Kaul had pointed out that the government was also sitting over 10 names, cleared by the SC collegium for appointment as HC judges, for periods ranging from seven to 19 months. He said the SC collegium’s recommendation for appointment of five advocates as judges of Calcutta HC was sent to the government on July 25, 2019, and these were yet to be cleared. Similarly, an advocate’s name cleared for appointment as J&K HC judge has been pending for 17 months and four names for Delhi HC cleared by the collegium have been pending for seven months with the Centre. The law ministry recently sent the 45 names, recommended by various HC collegiums, to the SC collegium for scrutiny. The SC bench is scheduled to hear the case relating to delay in appointment of judges on April 8. A law ministry source said, “The oldest vacancy, to be filled from among advocates’ quota, dates back to October 14, 2014, in Orissa HC where the HC collegium is yet to make a recommendation even after more than six years. There are at least nine other HCs where against the oldest vacancy from bar quota, no recommendation has been made for more than five years.” Ministry sources said the situation was similar regarding filling up the posts of HC judges from among senior judicial officers. “There are three HCs where names against service quota vacancies have not been recommended by the HC collegiums for more than five years,” the source said. The ministry also laid the blame at the door of the SC collegium and said it had not yet recommended appointment of a judge against the vacancy arising from the retirement of CJI Ranjan Gogoi on November 17, 2019. Since then, vacancies have risen to five and no recommendation has been made by the SC collegium, they said, while flagging the lack of recommendation for appointment of women SC judges. Justice Indira Banerjee is the lone woman judge in the SC. Ministry sources cited the ‘Judges Case’ judgment by a constitution bench of the SC which had ruled that appointment of judges was not to be examined on the judicial side by constitutional courts. “Though appointment of constitutional court judges are not open to scrutiny on the judicial side, of late, attempts have been made by judges outside the collegium to drag judicial appointments for scrutiny in the course of hearing unrelated matters. There is a tendency to put the blame on the government for delay in judicial appointments,” it had said. The ministry said a record 687 HC judges were in position in 2018, which came down to 677 in 2019 and 668 in 2020. During the UPA regime, the highest number of judges in place in HCs was 639 in 2013. It said a record 126 HC judges were appointed in 2016. The average number of HC judges appointed during UPA-1 was 75 per year, in UPA-2, it was 74 per year. Under NDA, 103 HC judges per year have been appointed, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-high-courts-flouted-norms-on-judge-appointments-government/articleshow/81941192.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

India stands second in terms of daily rate of vaccine doses administered with an average of 26.53 lakh daily shots given to recipients. The US has the highest rate of daily shots given at 30.53 lakh. However, other countries like Brazil, the UK and Germany are far less at 6.23 lakh, 4.13 lakh and 3 lakh, respectively. However, the number of people fully vaccinated in India still stands at just about one crore. Experts say the upswing in cases seems to have pushed people to get vaccinated, resulting in higher footfall in recent days. Around 2 crore people in the 45-60 age group and over 3.44 crore people above 60 have received their first dose while 12.58 lakh people above 45 years have also received their second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/world-topper-43-lakh-vaccines-doses-in-a-single-day/articleshow/81941721.cms||---

CPI(Maoist) Dandakaranya special zonal committee spokesman Vikalp issued a statement on Tuesday to say that Manhas was “captured” during the April 3 encounter in Tekulguda and that he would “remain safe in their custody as a prisoner”. “The government must first announce names of mediators. Then, we will hand him over to police,” the release said. The rebels admitted that five of its cadres, including a woman, were killed in the gunfight. The commando’s wife, Meenu, has appealed to PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to bring him home, just as they brought Wing Commander Abhinandan back from Pakistani captivity. On Tuesday, activists in Bastar lent their voice to the call for his release. Soni Sori and Sujeet Sharma of Jail Bandi Rihayi Samiti appealed to Maoists to free Manhas at the earliest. Meanwhile, hundreds turned up for the funeral in the little hamlet of Mohda in Gariaband district, over 550km from the killing fields of Tarrem where Sukhram Singh, a constable with the Special Task Force, was martyred. Wails rent the air when the soldier’s coffin was carried into the village. Carrying his one-year-old grandson on his sagging shoulders, Fagguram watched in tears as his son came home in a coffin, carried by four soldiers. In Maoist-hit Kanker’s Pandripani village, the coffin bearing the name of DRG personnel Ramesh Kumar Jurri lay on the ground as his fouryear-old son watched and asked, “What’s inside?” He was cremated in the backyard of the house. In Banjugni village of Kondagaon, the wife of martyr Ramdas Korram, sat in front of pictures of gods and goddesses. Her two sons, aged four and two, stood clueless about what had brought a crowd to their doorstep.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/maoists-want-talks-to-free-jawan-held-hostage/articleshow/81941752.cms||Rashmi Drolia

But even as he expressed optimism about the pace of vaccinations, he warned Americans that the nation is not yet out of the woods when it comes to the pandemic. "Let me be deadly earnest with you: We aren't at the finish line. We still have a lot of work to do. We're still in a life and death race against this virus," Biden said in remarks at the White House. The president warned that "new variants of the virus are spreading and they're moving quickly. Cases are going back up, hospitalizations are no longer declining." He added that ''the pandemic remains dangerous,`` and encouraged Americans to continue to wash their hands, socially distance and wear masks. Biden added that while his administration is on schedule to meet his new goal of distributing 200 million doses of the vaccine during his first 100 days, it will still take time for enough Americans to get vaccinated to slow the spread of the virus. But he expressed hope that his Tuesday announcement, that every adult will be eligible by April 19 to sign up and get in a virtual line to be vaccinated, will help expand access and distribution of the vaccine. Some states already had begun moving up their deadlines from the original May 1 goal. "No more confusing rules. No more confusing restrictions," Biden said. Biden made the announcement after visiting a Covid-19 vaccination site at Immanuel Chapel at Virginia Theological Seminary in Alexandria. During his visit, he thanked everyone for administering the shots and for showing up to receive them. "That's the way to beat this," Biden said. "Get the vaccination when you can." The president also said no one should fear mutations of the coronavirus that are showing up in the US after being discovered in other countries. He acknowledged that the new strains are more virulent and more dangerous, but said "the vaccines work on all of them." Biden also announced that 150 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been shot into arms since his inauguration on January 20. That puts the president well on track to meet his new goal of 200 million shots administered by his 100th day in office on April 30. Biden's original goal had been 100 million shots by the end of his first 100 days, but that number was reached in March. Still, he acknowledged Tuesday that his administration fell short of its goal to deliver at least one shot to every teacher, school staff member and childcare worker during the month of March, to try to accelerate school reopenings. Biden announced the target early last month and directed federal resources toward achieving it, but said Tuesday that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that about 80% of teachers, school staff and childcare workers had received a shot. Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, also spent the day Tuesday focused on promoting the Covid-19 vaccine, each touring a vaccination center, Harris in Chicago and Emhoff in Yakima, Washington. Harris praised the workers and those receiving their vaccine at a site set up at a local union hall, and spoke of spring as "a moment where we feel a sense of renewal." "We can see a light at the end of the tunnel,'' she said. Some states are making plans to ease their health restrictions, even as the country is facing a potential new surge in virus cases. On Tuesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, warned that the country is in a ``critical time'' because ``we could just as easily swing up into a surge.`` ``That would be a setback for public health, but that would be a psychological setback, too,'' he said during an interview with the National Press Club. He noted that Americans are experiencing ``COVID-19 fatigue'' after more than a year of lockdowns and restrictions to public life aimed at slowing the spread of the virus. Biden and many of his advisers have warned against reopening the economy too quickly and easing mask mandates, at the risk of driving a fresh surge in virus cases. ``We just don't want to have to go back to really shutting things down. That would be terrible,'' Fauci said. But Biden's announcement of the April 19 deadline was aimed at injecting optimism into a public that's grown weary of the restrictions, and it comes as a flood of vaccine is being sent to states this week. Jeff Zients, the White House coronavirus coordinator, told governors Tuesday during a weekly conference call that more than 28 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines will be delivered to states this week, White House press secretary Jen Psaki announced at her daily briefing. That allocation brings the total amount of vaccine distributed over the past three weeks to more than 90 million doses, Psaki said. At least a dozen states opened eligibility to anyone 16 and older on Monday alone, while New Jersey and Oregon announced this week that all residents 16 and older will become eligible on April 19. The president had announced just last week that 90% of adults would be eligible for one of three approved COVID-19 vaccines by April 19, in addition to having a vaccination site within 5 miles of their home. But eligibility isn't the same as actually being vaccinated. Being eligible means people can sign up to reserve their place in a virtual line until they can schedule an appointment. ``That doesn't mean they will get it that day,'' Psaki said, speaking of a vaccine shot. ``It means they can join the line that day if they have not already done that beforehand.'' Seniors still waiting to be vaccinated should seek appointments quickly ``because the lines are going to become longer`` after April 19, Psaki said. ``There are going to be more people waiting.'' The White House said Monday that nearly 1 in 3 Americans and over 40% of adults have received at least one shot, and nearly 1 in 4 adults is fully vaccinated. Seventy-five percent of people older than 65 have now received at least one shot, and more than 55% of them are fully vaccinated. Two of the three vaccines requires two doses administered several weeks apart. The third vaccine requires just one shot.

Mamata had asked Modi two days ago how he knew the poll result. “Are you god or superhuman?” she said at a rally in Hooghly’s Khanakul on Sunday. Modi’s response came on Tuesday at a rally in north Bengal’s Coochbehar. “Recently, you appealed against splitting Muslim votes. It shows that the Muslim vote bank, once your strength, is slipping away. Muslims too have started distancing themselves from you,” Modi said, explaining the rationale behind her “Mussalman ek ho jao, mujhe bachao (Muslims unite to save me)” appeals. “Remember what Didi had once said? I am ready to be kicked by the cow that gives me milk,” Modi told the crowd at a Howrah rally later in the afternoon. “She has broken the hearts of the people of Bengal,” he said. “I don’t know if Didi has got notices from the Election Commission. But had I said all Hindus must unite and vote for BJP, the EC would have sent eight to 10 notices to me.” According to him, Mamata’s “khela (game)” at a Nandigram booth last week was enough to indicate that she had lost. “Your anger at everything — from someone wearing a tilak to the Election Commission to electronic voting machines — shows that you have lost,” he said. “Didi asks me how I know about the outcome? Am I god or superhuman? I say Trinamool’s defeat is written on the faces of janta janardan (the masses). And Didi’s anger, her desperation, the language she is using, say it all.” Modi also pointed to how the Bengal CM’s tone and tenor in the time of elections had changed. “There was a time when you used to ask for deployment of central forces. The EC, central security forces and EVMs helped you win polls in the last 10 years. Now you are blaming the EC, casting aspersions on security forces. You have problems with the EVM too,” he said. “People say you love to play football. But this time you have scored a self-goal,” he added. Modi then referred to the leaked “audio tapes” on illegal coal-mining in Bengal that was cite md by BJP a couple of days ago as “proof” of corruption. “Koyla dhule maila jay na (Washing away coal grime will not wash away the filth),” he said, connecting the alleged scam to the “Bhaipo Service Tax” (a reference to the CM’s nephew, Diamond Harbour Trinamool MP Abhishek Banerjee). He asked the Howrah crowd to respond to Mamata’s charges that BJP was giving money to people to attend its rallies. “Have you been paid to attend this rally? Isn’t this an insult?” he asked, exhorting people to “punish” those who had insulted them. The PM then spoke about his efforts to pick up Bengali and the taunts he had been facing for his pronunciation. “I started wishing MPs on their birthdays in their mother tongue after I assumed office. I wish an MP from Tamil Nandi in Tamil and those from Bengal in Bengali. I once wished Banerjee in Bengali on her birthday. She wrote back to me in Gujarati. I liked it. I try to pick up bits and pieces of the local language and use them in my speech when I go to different parts of India. I know my Bengali pronunciation is not good but am trying,” he said. Modi assured the people that BJP would continue with the existing state welfare schemes in Bengal if and when it assumed office. “Some people told me Didi was saying all benefits would stop if she lost the election. This is a blatant lie and a ploy to confuse people,” he said. “Kichhui bandha hobe na (Nothing will stop).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/pm-modi-to-didi-your-minority-vote-call-shows-youve-lost/articleshow/81942025.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya

An EC official said the change was necessary as the eight officers — ROs of Chowinghee, Entally, Beliaghata, Jorasanko, Shyampukur, Kashipur-Belgachia, Kolkata Port and Bhowanipore — had been holding the post for more than four years. EC sources said the norm of removing officers who had held the same post for over four years had been stringently followed in the districts, but not in the case of these officers posted in Kolkata. Of these assembly segments, Kolkata Port and Ballygunge will vote on April 26, and the others on April 29 — phase seven and eight of the eight-phase Bengal polls. The nomination process for these phases is currently underway. During phase seven, a total of 36 assembly constituencies go to the polls, whereas 35 do so in the last phase. An official said the ROs — who play a key role in the election process — have been shifted in order to maintain the sanctity of the polling process, so that no question of bias could be raised later. ROs are tasked with conducting polls in a free and fair manner. They also hand over winners’ certificates to candidates and manage everything on behalf of the EC. They need to ensure that the staff and on-duty police are properly posted through a process of randomisation so that no one feels threatened and electoral malpractices and complaints are properly handled, the official added. In end-March, the EC had removed the RO of Ballygunge, Arindam Mani, as he had been in the same post of additional director of directorate of land revenue for over three years. He has been posted as an officer on special duty of the PAR department. A new set of eight WBCS (executive) officers will take charge immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/election-commission-shunts-8-kolkata-returning-officers-ahead-of-april-26-29-polls/articleshow/81942065.cms||Debasis Konar

Jio signed an agreement with Airtel to acquire some of the latter’s spectrum in the 800 MHz band in Andhra Pradesh, Delhi and Mumbai circles at an aggregate deal value of about Rs 1,497 crore. As part of the agreement, Airtel would receive Rs 1,038 crore from Jio for the proposed transfer. In addition, Jio will also assume the future liabilities of Rs 459 crore relating to the spectrum. Notwithstanding the deal, Jio and Airtel have often been at loggerheads with each other right since Mukesh Ambani re-entered the telecom business in September, 2016. Airtel, founded by Sunil Mittal, had accused Jio of engaging in predatory prices to capture the telecom market, while also alleging that the new entrant had disrupted the financial model of the telecom industry by making voice-calling free. Jio, on the other hand, had accused Airtel and other rival Vodafone Idea of deliberately not providing enough inter-connection points at the time of the launch of its services, which had finally seen regulator Trai slap a Rs 3,050-crore penalty on the rivals of Ambani’s venture. Commenting on the current deal, Gopal Vittal, MD and CEO (India and South Asia), of Airtel, said, “The sale of the 800 MHz blocks in these three circles has enabled us to unlock value from the spectrum that was unutilised. This is aligned to our overall network strategy.” Jio gets a “right to use” on Airtel’s 800 MHz spectrum in Andhra Pradesh (3.75 MHz), Delhi (1.25 MHz) and Mumbai (2.50 MHz). “With this trading of right to use spectrum, Jio will have 2X15MHz of spectrum in the 800MHz band in Mumbai circle and 2X10MHz of spectrum in the 800MHz band in Andhra Pradesh and Delhi circles, thereby further consolidating its spectrum footprint in these circles. With the enhanced spectrum footprint, especially contiguous spectrum, and superior infrastructure deployed, Jio has further increased its network capacity,” Jio said. The companies said that the transaction is subject to requisite regulatory and statutory approvals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rivals-airtel-jio-ink-1500-crore-spectrum-trading-deal/articleshow/81942082.cms||Pankaj Doval

The first salvo came hardly one hour into polling when NSS general secretary G Sukumaran Nair said the people of the state want a regime change and urged them to vote for those who protect faith. Reacting to Nair’s statements, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the gods are with the LDF government. “Ayyappa and other gods … are with this government because it has protected all the people. The gods have always remained with those who do good for the people,” he said after voting at the R C Amala Basic UP School in Pinarayi. Read AlsoBaited by oppn, S We Can, says PinarayiThiruvananthapuram: Kerala went to the polls on Tuesday to elect its 15th legislative assembly, registering a turnout of 74.2% that fell 2.8% short of the last assembly elections in 2016 (77.35%), which election commission sources attributed to the Covid-19 situation. The southern districts –CPM politburo member Kodiyeri Balakrishnan concurred with the CM, saying that if gods had votes, they would have voted in LDF’s favour. “The LDF government had ensured protection to all believers belonging to the Muslim, Christian and Hindu religions. The LDF government had carried out unprecedented development work in Sabarimala during the last five years. So, believers are coming to the polling booths in droves to vote for LDF,” he said. The CM’s comments sparked a series of reactions from leaders from across the political spectrum. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala lashed out at Vijayan, saying the wrath of god would fall upon the LDF government for trampling on the faith of Ayyappa devotees.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Responding sharply to the CM’s statement, BJP president K Surendran said Vijayan made a U-turn on Sabarimala on polling day as he was frightened about losing the election. “It was Pinarayi Vijayan and his fellow demons who destroyed Sabarimala and they provided government facilities to clear the way for the entry of young women to the hill shrine,” he said.

Congress politician and MP K Sudhakaran said the gods had never favoured “asuras”. “Nowhere in history (sic) we can see them coming together,” he said. Minister A K Balan filed a complaint with the Election Commission alleging that Nair and Chennithala were misusing the election in the name of faith and religion and that they were attempting to portray the elections as a battle between believers and non-believers. “The messages were given by Nair as well as UDF leaders in the first hour of polling.

Congress politician and MP K Sudhakaran said the gods had never favoured “asuras”. “Nowhere in history (sic) we can see them coming together,” he said. Minister A K Balan filed a complaint with the Election Commission alleging that Nair and Chennithala were misusing the election in the name of faith and religion and that they were attempting to portray the elections as a battle between believers and non-believers. “The messages were given by Nair as well as UDF leaders in the first hour of polling. This is a violation of the Representation of People Act and the Constitution,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/kerala/kerala-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-says-gods-with-ldf-draws-opposition-ire/articleshow/81942090.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

They had been married for just two months. Years went by. But a chance conversation about a woman in her village, a soldier’s widow like herself, finally getting pension sparked hope. Paruli, now 82, has been declared eligible as well. “In Pithoragarh, many don’t know their way around the pension system, especially widows of soldiers,” said retired assistant treasury officer Dilip Singh Bhandari. It was a difficult case to begin with. It was old. Her husband had not died fighting or at a posting. According to rules by the Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare, pension for death is given out when someone dies in service, or because of causes attributable to military service. Family pension is given in case of “natural death of the individual”. Paruli’s husband had not died of natural causes. “But in July 1977, a woman had in the Allahabad HC challenged that only war widows were eligible for pension. In 1985, the judge had ruled in her favour,” said Bhandari. “I took up her case with the Controller General of Defence Accounts, Allahabad, and the Kumaon Regiment Centre. After seven years of correspondences, they finally accepted her claim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/70-years-after-his-death-soldiers-widow-found-eligible-for-pension/articleshow/81942105.cms||Prem Punetha
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Teacher finds girl, 14, married off for Rs 6,000||DEHRADUN: When school reopened in February at a village in Chamoli, one girl was missing. The teacher asked around. He had gone door to door, calling students back to school. Exams were round the corner and she was nowhere to be found. After relentless questioning, the girl’s father finally confessed that the 14-year-old had been married off to a 32year-old man for which Rs 6,000 had exchanged hands during the lockdown. For a year, she had been tortured and raped. With threats of the implications of child marriage, the teacher managed to persuade her father to bring her back from Dehradun. In a video that has been widely circulated on social media, he narrated the plight of the young girl. After seeing the video, the state has ordered an investigation, following which an FIR is being filed against everyone involved. On Monday, dressed in a pink salwar suit, with a mangalsutra and thick vermillion on her head, the girl was brought to the school. She broke down. “My husband would beat me. He never treated me well,” she said.“Bandhi ke mahine mein hui thi shaadi (I got married during lockdown).” She appeared for her Class VIII exam on Monday and on Tuesday, and is now home. “Her mother died a few years ago. She has three younger siblings at home. Her elder sister, too, had been married off before she turned 18,” the teacher told TOI. “This happens often in the hill districts of Uttarakhand. Poor people give away their daughters, most of whom are underage, for money.” As his plea went viral, the district administration sent a Child Welfare Committee official to investigate. “It has been established that the girl is minor and was married to a man who tortured her,” the official, Prabha Rawat, said. Chamoli district magistrate Swati Bhadauriya said the CWC and revenue police went to the village after she saw the video. “We have taken suo motu cognizance of the matter. The teacher’s intervention has been commendable,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/teachers-search-for-missing-kid-brings-to-light-a-child-marriage/articleshow/81942043.cms||Ishita Mishra

According to ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, “Railways completed much awaited about 30km-long Hajipur-Goshwar-Vaishali lines, which was the part of the 150km-long Hajipur–Sigauli new line project.” He said commissioning of rail services over 1.9km-long Kosi mega rail bridge was a major achievement during the pandemic period. “It has shortened the 298km distance between Nirmali and Saraigarh via Darbhanga-Samastipur-Khagaria-Mansi-Saharsa to 22km due to direct connectivity. Migrant workers who had returned from other states during the lockdown were engaged by the railways to complete the bridge work in time,” Rajesh said. Officials said railways has also completed a new rail bridge replacing the old Kiul-Lakhisarai rail bridge during the 2020-21 fiscal. Deliberating on the track-doubling works, he said railways completed Samastipur-Darbhanga (38km), Darbhnaga-Thalwara (9km), Ramna-Nagar Untari (11km), Nagar Untari-Birhamganj (12km), Garwah-Ramna (32km), Garwah-Meralgram (11.5km), Jaranghdih-Daniya (29km), Jarangdih-Bokaro (6km), Daniya-Jogeshwar Vihar (6km) on March 27. He said railways completed gauge conversion work at an estimated cost of Rs1475 crore on the Sakri-Loukha Bazar-Nirmali and Saharsa-Forbesganj routes. To improve track safety, railways completed Bachhwara yard remodelling, route relay interlocking work at Muzaffarpur station and panel interlocking works at different places under the ECR. “The ECR also completed 311 route km rail electrification work on different routes to ensure smooth running of electric locomotives hauled passenger train services on each section in its all five divisions,” the CPRO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rlys-completes-many-major-projects-in-ecr/articleshow/81937603.cms||Kumod Verma

In his inaugural address, department head Atul Aditya Pandey explained the significance of river-linking projects in mitigating the sufferings of the people due to the acute scarcity of potable water in different parts of the country and the state. He also discussed the effects of global warming and climate change on the dwindling capacity of the surface water resources. Head of the geology department at Patna Science College, Anil Kumar, also pleaded for implementation of various river interlinking projects for augmenting the surface water resources. “The rivers in north Bihar may be linked with those in south Bihar for even distribution of water,” Anil said and encouraged students to take all necessary measures for conserving water and creating awareness in society. At the outset, geology teacher Bhavuk Sharma told the faculty members and the students of the department about the vision of the Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali mission of the state government and its utility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pu-students-teachers-discuss-ways-to-create-new-water-sources/articleshow/81937672.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

As part of the campaign, steps have been taken to plant saplings, make soak pits and check dams besides strengthening rainwater harvesting system. Encroachments are also being removed from water bodies. At a meeting with senior officials in Patna last week, CM Nitish Kumar had called for effective steps to maintain groundwater level in the state. Deputy development commissioner (DDC) Suman Kumar, who held a review meeting on Monday, asked the officials concerned to ensure availability of water in each farmland in the district. The DDC asked public health and engineering department executive engineer to identify the places where people had faced water crisis last year and ensure repair of hand pumps. He asked the officials to chalk out ways in advance to supply water to these places through tankers during the summer season. Taking strong exception to complaints regarding slackness on the part of engineers in carrying out technical survey in Dumaria, Belaganj, Mohanpur, Konch, Barachatti and Sherghati, the DDC said action would be taken against them if the progress of work was not found satisfactory this week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/gaya-admn-takes-steps-for-water-conservation/articleshow/81937631.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Casting nets before daybreak, casting votes before day ends||T’puram: Early on Tuesday morning, a group of fishermen huddled around a maze of brightly-coloured fishing nets at Perumathura where boats, filled with fresh catch, were secured to the wharf. These men had set out at 4am and had returned earlier than expected to mend their torn nets. Two men with lined faces scooped up a handful of leftover rice smeared with fish gravy and later they started cleaning the vessel. Their job was done for the day. It was business as usual for fishermen on the day of elections. Auctioneers sniffed around boats to sense the priciest catch. Cleaners, loading staff milled around trucks and boats to do their job. Leaning back on a bed of nets, Jose, a gulf returnee, is confident that his party will return to power. “We will go and cast our votes in the evening, our party is coming back to power and we want to be a part of it. We can’t compromise on our catch though,” said Jose who lost his job in Kuwait and had to return home in September 2020. When he was jobless, his government took care of his family. He quotes verbatim from the campaign notices of LDF which lists the achievements with special stress on food kits from ration shops. His friend Thomas frowned at him with a look which said ‘You can't be serious’. “It’s time we thought of a change. If we had a professional team to monitor the construction of harbour here, we would not have lost so many lives,” he fumed over the frequent drownings of fishermen at Perumathura owing to unscientific construction of breakwater. Over the past few years, many fishermen had lost lives here, including some of their friends. “He was a Congress man, he switched sides 10 years ago and now he is all praise about LDF,” Thomas teased Jose about his past. The pandemic-ravaged coastal villagers haven’t got back on their feet fully. Outside the harbour, Rugmini and Prasanna had just wound up their business. They get a small share of fish from the boats that they resell at reasonable prices. “We are nearing 60 and still every single morning, we rise early and work.  or not, we have to work. We will vote for the party who cares for us,” said Prasanna. Votes from coastal hamlets are crucial in Chirayinkeezhu where V Sasi, the LDF candidate is confident of his victory despite high-pitched campaigns by Congress and BJP. Raheem, his bare chest and belly dotted with fish scales, catches a ride from Vizhinjam to Thazhampally to help load the fish. He had borne the worst of months during the lockdown and reserves his vote for the evening. By noon, he gets a decent sum for his labour and returns home by bus. “We had a horrible last year, the cops never let us survive. Even if we managed to get some fish for sale with our meagre savings, police wouldn’t let us sell and we suffered badly. Kits aren’t enough to make a living. Casting vote is our right and our only way to let them know how we feel about what the government does,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/casting-nets-before-daybreak-casting-votes-before-day-ends/articleshow/81939182.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Joseph had lost both his hands in a train accident when he was 14. But ever since he was able enough to exercise his franchise, Joseph has got inked -- in his case, on the toe of his left leg. On Tuesday, Joseph, now 64, reached the booth at VJBS, Valiyakulam in Udayamperoor to cast his invaluable vote. "I think that an  is the only occasion where a citizen can express his likes and dislikes on the type of governance he wishes to have, in a democratic system," said Joseph, who sells lottery tickets at the Vyttila Hub in Kochi. However, Joseph had a different approach to 'voting' this time. Until recently he used to press on the Electronic Voting Machine with the fingers on his legs. This time, he fixed a pen to his elbow to press the button next to the name of the candidate of his choice. Meanwhile, 57-year-old Krishnakumar's election story is different. He had skipped the last two assembly elections and the polls to the parliament as well. "I was not at all bothered about casting my constitutional right,” said the Tripunithura-native. The reluctance to vote, he claims, was partly because his "name had been removed from the old voters' list". However, this term, he had a change of mind. "In fact, it was just a few weeks ago that I applied for a new voter card and I received it with a serial number on Monday, just the day before polling," said Krishnakumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/joseph-voted-with-a-pen-got-inked-on-his-toe/articleshow/81939188.cms||Sivadas Varma

Tejashwi alleged that the main accused, Pravin Jha, is close to the DSP of Benipatti and the Madhubani SP. Madhubani SP Satya Prakash, however, rubbished the allegation levelled against the police officers and said action against the accused was initiated on the basis of evidence. “The family has been provided proper security cover and raids are on to nab the remaining culprits. Till date, 12 accused have been arrested and property of 10 accused attached on the directive of the court,” the SP said. Tejashwi, meanwhile, said the two senior police officers should be shifted from the district as they would influence the investigation. Tejashwi also shared the photographs of Pravin Jha with the DSP. “The family members are feeling unsafe. The district administration has not provided security to the family. Justice can't be expected till the SP and the DSP are there,” Tejashwi said. Tejashwi said CM Nitish Kumar should visit the village and know the truth. “The CM is being misled by junior police officers. The DGP briefed the CM about the incident based on the reports sent by the SP and the DSP,” he said. Launching a scathing attack on Nitish for his “failure” to contain crime, the former deputy CM said he (Nitish) is feeling tired and is unable to discharge his responsibility as CM. Five people were killed and another injured when a group of armed assailants attacked the house of Sanjay Singh and sprayed a volley of bullets. A BSF personnel was also killed in the firing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/madhubani-killings-tejashwi-seeks-transfer-of-sp-dsp/articleshow/81937556.cms||Ramashankar

The curfew will be imposed from 8pm to 6am from Wednesday night. Instead of four major cities of Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot, night curfew will also be imposed in Jamnagar, Bhavnagar, Junagadh, Anand, Nadiad, Mehsana, Morbi, Patan, Dahod, Amreli, Godhra, Gandhidham, Bhuj, Bharuch and Surendranagar, among others. CM Vijay Rupani, after discussing the HC recommendations in the high-level core committee meeting, announced that the government has decided to give permission to only 100 guests for weddings. No permission will be granted for any social and political meetings except for events in Gandhinagar and Morva Hadaf where local polls and byelections are due. The state also decided that goverment offices will remain closed on all Saturdays and Sundays for the month of April. The measures were announced after Gujarat virtually stared at a lockdown when the Gujarat high court directed the state government to impose three to four days of lockdown or weekend lockdown to curb Covid-19 surge that has breached 3,000 cases-mark for past six days. On Tuesday, the state recorded yet another record high of 3,280 cases in 24 hours and reported 17 deaths, the highest toll during the current surge. The HC's advice to the state government sent people across major cities thronging major grocery marts to stock up on essentials in wake of an impending shutdown. During an online hearing, a bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice B D Karia said a lockdown or curfew for 3 to 4 days is needed. “You may please convey our concern to the decision makers that urgent and serious steps need to be taken to check this. Otherwise, the Covid-19 situation will go out of control. May be three-four days of curfew or lockdown can be imposed to check the situation at the moment,” Chief Justice Nath told advocate general Kamal Trivedi who was summoned along with government pleader Manisha Shah by the court. The CJ said that Gujarat has got more than 3,000 cases and the city of Ahmedabad has over 700 cases. “Things are going from bad to worse,” he said and added that there is a shortage of beds in hospitals. The night curfew imposed from between 9pm and 6am in four major cities of Gujarat was not proving to be effective, according to Chief Justice Nath. Earlier, during the discussion, the advocate general told the court that lockdown was suggested during a Covid-19 review meeting two days ago. “Lockdown comes with miseries for the poor. The government is in a catch-22 situation,” the AG said seeking guidance from the court. The court also told the government officers to immediately impose curbs on large gatherings and put a cap of 25-50 persons for funerals and marriages. There should also not be political gatherings of large scale. The government assured the court that this suggestion would be immediately implemented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-proposes-a-lockdown-guj-govt-strengthens-night-curfew/articleshow/81939014.cms||---

The shares were allotted at the upper end of the IPO price band of Rs 483-486 per share. The Rs 2,500-crore IPO of Macrotech will open on Wednesday.

---||Business||Split chairman, MD posts in FY22: Sebi||MUMBAI: With less than a year left for top listed companies to separate the positions of chairman and managing director, markets regulator Sebi’s chairman on Tuesday indicated that the last date to comply with the rule may not be extended again. He also expressed his frustration that India Inc is yet to ensure that independent directors on their boards are truly independent. Speaking at a corporate governance summit organised by industry trade body CII, Sebi chief Ajay Tyagi said that the top 500 listed companies were initially required to separate the roles of chairperson and MD/CEO by April 1, 2020. However, based on industry representations, the deadline was extended by two years. “As at the end of December 2020, only 53% of the top 500 listed entities had complied with this provision. I urge the eligible listed entities to be prepared for this change in advance of the deadline,” Tyagi said. The underlying idea for such a separation was not to weaken the position of the promoter, but to improve corporate governance, he said. “The objective is to provide a better and more balanced governance structure by enabling more effective supervision of the management. Separation of the roles will reduce excessive concentration of authority in a single individual. Having the same person as chairman and MD brings in conflict of interest,” Tyagi said. On the issue of independent directors on the boards of listed companies, Sebi chief said that despite its efforts, India Inc was yet to get “the ideal solutions to issues such as ‘ensuring independence of independent directors’”, ‘selecting the best suited persons as independent directors’, ‘making their role more effective and meaningful’, etc.” Another issue was howsoever the related processes were strengthened, “ones who are genuinely not independent will never be. It is true that human behaviour cannot be fully regulated by norms.” However, Sebi will continue to work in improving the processes and disclosures “to bring in greater balance, transparency and quality” in selecting independent directors and functioning of corporate boards, he said. Touching on the subject of gender diversity on the boards of corporate India, the Sebi chief said that although ideally half of each board should consist of women or at least close to that, the actual figures are far from that. Gender diversity brings with it several economic and governance benefits. Research shows that companies having better gender diversity on their board have generally outperformed financially those which did not have such diversity, Tyagi pointed out. Since Sebi and the corporate affairs ministry pushed for such board diversity, from around 5-6% women on boards in 2014, the number increased to 12% within just a year in 2015 for top 500 companies. Currently, the figure is at around 17%. “While, there has been an improvement in gender diversity at the board level, data shows that representation of women in key board committees such as the audit committee and nomination and remuneration committee remains quite low at around 7%. Clearly, we still have a long way to go,” Tyagi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/split-chairman-md-posts-in-fy22-sebi/articleshow/81938925.cms||---

Ltd., that has applied for an NUE (New Umbrella Entity) license for Retail Payments with RBI. Vishwakarma Payments was incorporated in India under the Companies Act in 2013. Besides Chola, the Vishwakarma Payments consortium has top payment enabling platforms like FSS, Zoho, Zerodha, RazorPay, Ujjivan and Airpay. To encourage and enable those who aspire to fuel a less-cash and more-digital micro-payments economy, RBI had set up a framework to authorise pan-India Umbrella Entities with focus on retail payment systems. The interoperable infrastructure will cater to banks and non-banks and enable innovative use-cases to solve the diversity, depth and width of consumers and small businesses in India.

---||Business||AC prices up 13%, 2nd hike since January||CHENNAI: Airconditioner manufacturers have raised prices by 8-13% for the second time in less than 100 days. The reason being cited is increasing input costs such as those incurred on AC parts and ocean freight. Blue Star managing director B Thiagarajan said, “Input costs of steel, copper and ABS plastic are up 25% on an average since March 2020. After raising the selling price of ACs 5-8% in January 2021, we have raised another 3-5% as on April 1. We also expect to hold it despite the price hike.” However, in select categories, prices were kept 10% lower than last year to gain market share. Panasonic officials said that given the market conditions, they plan to raise prices of ACs by 6-8%, while refrigerators will see an increase in the range of 3-4%. This is due to the rise in cost of commodities, thereby increasing the price of production. Panasonic India and South Asia president & CEO Manish Sharma said, “As an organisation, we try to absorb maximum costs at our end and not pass it to our consumers. In the last 3-4 months, there’s been 25% growth in sales of air conditioners.” While LG Electronics India has increased prices 5-7% this year, Voltas said ACs and cooling appliances have witnessed an overall 3-5% increase in average market price. Customs duties on some of the components have also gone up. Godrej Appliances said after rising prices by 3-5% rise in January, an additional 3-5% hike is happening again in April. Its ACs product group head Santosh Salian said, “Commodity prices are not coming in control. In the initial stages of commodity prices going up last year by around 13%, manufacturers did not pass on the entire cost to customers at that time. They waited till demand picked up in the summer season to pass on the price increase.” There is a tremendous price increase on ocean freight too — up 3x as compared to pre-Covid levels. Besides, this channel is also witnessing a shortage of containers coming to India, manufacturers said. “Most input parts like steel, compressors are imported, and the freight price has gone up by 200-300% to $3,300 per container from $900 in pre-Covid times,” Salian added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ac-prices-up-13-2nd-hike-since-jan/articleshow/81938398.cms||Mamtha Asokan

Police said the criminals cut the veins of Rajak’s wrists with a sharp-edged weapon and poured acid into his mouth. A police patrolling team later spotted Rajak lying in a pool of blood and took him to a local hospital, where the doctors declared him brought dead. The police team recovered an empty acid bottle and a piece of rope from the spot. The incident occurred when Rajak was returning to Begusarai from Patna in the ambulance after dropping a jail inmate at Patna Medical College and Hospital. He was alone in the ambulance at the time of the incident. Begusarai jail superintendent Brajesh Mehta said Rajak was a regular employee. Begusarai SP Awakash Kumar said though the motive behind the murder was yet to be ascertained, prima facie the incident appeared to be a case of loot or personal enmity. Rajak’s son Sandip, however, said his father had no enmity with anyone. Rajak was a resident of Mahmadpur area in Begusarai town. Angry over his murder, residents of the locality protested near the Begusarai DM office on Tuesday. Begusarai SDM Sanjiv Kumar Choudhary said the victim’s son has lodged an FIR in connection with the case. “The administration will recommend all possible help under the government service code to Rajak’s family as he was a government servant,” the SDM added. Mehta said the jail administration has also lodged a separate case as Rajak was on official duty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/40-year-old-ambulance-driver-of-begusarai-jail-brutally-murdered/articleshow/81937569.cms||Rajiv Kumar

A full-length idol of Tilka Manjhi, the first Adivasi (tribal) freedom fighter who took up armed struggle against British in 1784, will be installed there. A four-member committee headed by TMBU vice-chancellor Neelima Gupta was constituted on Tuesday for outlining the modalities and preparing a detailed project report (DPR) for the beautification and turning the campus into ‘Tilka Manjhi Vatika’. Other members of the committee are registrar Niranjan Prasad Yadav, dean (students welfare) Ram Pravesh Singh and junior engineer Anjani Kumar. The walls of the campus will also be decked up with Manjusha paintings prevalent in this region known in ancient time as Anga. Assistance from noted artistes, including principal of Kala Kendra at Bhagalpur, Guru Ramlakhan, is also being taken for the beautification of the campus and the vatika. Gupta said the objective is to provide good ambience with natural surroundings to the officials, teachers, staff, students and visitors. “We want to make the surroundings green and decked up with flowers being grown in the garden. People should also know about the great freedom fighter Tilka Manjhi,” the VC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tmbu-to-develop-garden-on-campus/articleshow/81937657.cms||Kumar Rajesh

At the onset, the plethora of negative news, coupled with information about job losses and a slowing economy, created a variety of stresses like anxiety, sense of helplessness and loss of hope. As the situation is gradually moving towards the ‘evolving’ normal, there is still a feeling of lesser control over one’s own life and what appears to be a ‘reset’ of what the future may look like. Organisations that were agile enough to adapt and learn were able to achieve significant levels of productivity in 2020 with their remote work force. Companies that had great focus on their digital transformation were able to set up collaboration and engagement tools, and that helped people navigate the journey over the last year. Yet, as the situation is changing, the aspect of ‘worry’ is still looming. According to a recent survey done by EY, of the nearly 13,000 consumers in 13 countries, 37% indicated it would be months or years before normality returned to the work environment, with 64% saying they are more cautious in terms of their physical health. Indeed, over two-thirds of people (57%) noted they would be extremely uncomfortable or just uncomfortable using public transport because of the potential for Covid exposure. The ‘burn-out’ of employees is rather becoming a considerable topic of concern, with work-life structures collapsing into people’s personal lives. But talking about a possible impact on one’s mental health is still considered a taboo in both personal and professional space. Past surveys indicate many workers have been afraid to take this step. A majority of employees (68%) worry that reaching out over a mental health issue could negatively impact their job security, according to a study done by Businessolver. Another key aspect of this period also highlighted that the millennial and Gen Z population, known to thrive on social media and digital interactions, also felt a severe blow to their social lives. Workplaces had become their second homes and colleagues were operating as their friendship networks. Increased screen time has affected their ability to manage their professional and personal work-life balance. There is definitely need for progressive organisations to take critical steps in order to not only retain their talent but also ensure a nurturing culture and environment for its people... * Hybrid working models: Organisations will need to look at working models wherein there is modular availability of networking possibilities, online or physical. And if people want to get together in small groups to brainstorm or if they have a choice to continue working remotely. * Flexibility: Communicating about flexibility around the day’s management and focusing on outcomes is a way of letting people catch frequent breaks and take time off during work days as well. * Mental health awareness: It’s also critical to sensitise managers about mental health and educate them about biases and prejudices that may underplay the situation. They also need to be soft-trained on how to handle matters of concern when team dynamics are affected. * Regular support: Organisations will need to invest in long-term platforms and tools that can help employees reach out for help if needed. The HR community would need to learn, un-learn and re-learn about matters of mental health and how to handle such situations with care and responsibility. At Sun life Asia Service Centers, we have taken several steps in this direction by giving our people paid ‘Wellness Day offs’ along with instituting ‘Meeting-free Friday’ afternoons in order to help people take ‘mental’ breaks from work. We also have an ongoing programme for employee assistance, and people make regular use of the 24x7 online consultation support they receive over any such related issues. We have insured that such data remains confidential and employees feel comfortable sharing their concerns or issues. We realise that this effort will need to be consistent and caring in nature for the long term. It’s noteworthy that this period will help top talent acknowledge organisations that have wellness of their people at their heart. It would further build the positive brand besides driving the attrition and attraction agenda. But most importantly, it’s imperative that while humanity tries to cross this bridge to the other side, companies and employees co-create an environment that’s safe and healthy for them to survive and thrive.

In his order, Justice CD Singh said, “The fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression in a secular state is not an absolute licence to injure and hurt religious feelings and faiths and beliefs of fellow citizens. A person who takes the risk of dissemination of blasphemous messages is not entitled to get the discretion of the court exercised in his favour.” The court passed the order on the anticipatory bail application filed on behalf of the accused Nadeem after an FIR was filed against him at Kursi Police station of Barabanki under Section 153 (A) of the IPC. Opposing the plea, government lawyer Rajesh Kumar Singh argued that allegations of the FIR were too serious against the accused. “On the earlier occasion also, the accused Nadeem was involved in similar nature of offence and as such he is habitual of disturbing harmony of the society by spreading hatred between the two communities,” added the government lawyer Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/freedom-of-expression-not-for-hurting-religious-feelings/articleshow/81940612.cms||Ravi Singh Sisodiya

The PRC is also likely to introduce postgraduate course in demography and diploma course in population studies. The site for the construction of PRC building was approved by the Union ministry of health and family welfare when its deputy director general D K Ojha visited PU recently and discussed the matter with vice-chancellor G K Chaudhary. A three-member PU team comprising PRC’s joint director Dilip Kumar, PU development officer P K Khan and PU engineer Sachin Dayal would visit Delhi on April 6 and make a PowerPoint presentation of the proposed building and courses before the economic advisor to the ministry. Dilip told the newspaper on Tuesday that the ministry has also asked PU to start advanced courses and training centres in Big Data Statistics and Biostatistics at the PRC. The proposed building will comprise a guesthouse and training centres besides the main research centre, he said. The ministry has already sanctioned more than Rs6 crore to PU in the first phase for construction of the building. It would sanction more funds as per needs of its expansion in the second phase, he said.

He had fled after looting a home guard jawan’s rifle and shooting at a passerby from it. City SP (west) Ashok Mishra said Vishal has criminal antecedents. “Vishal looted a rifle from a home guard jawan after thrashing him near Bihta railway station. He also opened fire from the rifle causing injury to a passerby and fled from the spot,” he said. The SP said police immediately started chasing the accused and surrounded him on Jinpura road. “When police tried to nab him, he fired at least three rounds again using the same rifle. Police had to retaliate in which he was shot at before his arrest,” he said. The SP said the accused was rushed to a hospital for treatment. Mishra said there was a gap of around one hour in the rifle loot incident and his arrest. “Things would become clear further after he gains consciousness and is interrogated. It is yet not clear what led to the dispute with the home guard jawan and looting his rifle,” he said.

The chief minister held a review meeting with officials of agriculture and allied sectors at his Tadepalli camp office on Tuesday.

Every eligible person, he said, should benefit from the schemes implemented without corruption. He instructed an action plan be prepared to benefit small and marginal farmers.

He also directed officials to brainstorm and prepare an action plan regarding the same. He said procurement of micro irrigation facilities through reverse tendering would help reduce costs, benefiting more farmers. The cost of drip and sprinkler systems would be fixed after taking subsidies of the Centre and state into consideration, he said. The chief minister also directed officials to focus on the problems of farmers cultivating mulberry. The chief minister reviewed the setting up of multi-purpose facility centres as part of agricultural infrastructure. The centres, with an estimated budget of Rs 14,562 crore, will provide 14 types of facilities to farmers.

NIA had recently registered a case and conducted searches at the house of Raghunath on allegations of his having links with Maoists. AP police booked a case against several civil liberties and civil rights activists at Piduguralla in Guntur district and Manchangiputta in Visakhapatnam district in November 2020 based on a deposition given by a person having connections with Maoist party. Various petitions have been filed before the high court seeking to quash the case registered against rights activists under UAPA. Later, NIA took over the investigation from AP police and registered a case in March. Following searches, Raghunath moved the high court seeking to quash the case against him and sought interim relief not to arrest him. Arguing on behalf of Raghunath, senior counsel L Ravichandar said he is being falsely implicated. He said allegations levelled against him are not true and the case is liable to be quashed.

The move is aimed at providing an alternative to urban middle income families from high real estate prices. With most urban middle income families in the state living in rented accommodations, the government has decided to provide them their own homes. Under the plan, chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has directed municipal and urban development department to acquire lands in every municipality and municipal corporation. The government has proposed acquisition of at least 25 acres in every municipality and 150 acres under every municipal corporation. Officials have been directed to purchase land in the open market wherever possible. The acquired land would be developed into housing layouts, some of them gated communities, where the government will build and sell house. The government has already started the process and is accepting applications from urban families till April 10. Layouts will have three categories — MIG I, MIG II, and MIG III — depending on size of plots. Prices will be fixed accordingly, as per incomes of the families. The government will develop these layouts with basic infrastructure like roads, electricity, drinking water, drainage, community halls, bus shelters, parks and space for commercial activity. The cost of land and initial investment by the government will also be factored in the prices of plots under the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-to-launch-real-estate-ventures-for-urban-families/articleshow/81937822.cms||Gopi Dara

Four plastic bottles filled with some highly inflammable liquid were also recovered. Police sources said the liquid was meant to be used as Molotov cocktail, better known as petrol bomb. The arms and explosives were stored with the motive of capturing a 12-kattha plot of land at Shastri Nagar, which is estimated to be worth more than Rs50 lakh, sources said. Munger SP Manavjit Singh Dhillon said one Suman Saurav alias Chotu, 25, was arrested in this connection. “Suman had recently started land dealing business. Police have come to know that his father had criminal antecedents,” he said, adding the house belonged to his father. The SP said besides the explosives, four countrymade pistols, 29 live cartridges of two different bores and two empty cartridges were also recovered from Suman’s bedroom. He said action was taken on the basis of intelligence input received by the police. “Their modus operandi is to capture disputed private or government land by force. He had brought some people to manufacture the bombs,” the SP said. He said Suman was being interrogated about his associates. “Suman and his associates mainly capture topo-land, which belongs to the government and is either periodically under river water due to erosion or thrown out with shifting of its course,” he said. Dhillon said police were tying to gather details of his associates with the help of Suman’s cellphone. Kasim Bazaar police station SHO Dharmendra Kumar said Suman had entered into an agreement with a woman to purchase a 12-kattha plot at Shastri Nagar in February this year. “The woman has a dispute with her sister over the land ownership. Suman had planned to capture that land,” the SHO said. The SHO said the bomb disposal squad diffused all the bombs. “Inflammable liquid samples from plastic bottles would be sent for forensic analysis,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/explosives-arms-seized-in-munger-one-arrested/articleshow/81937638.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The BFSI sector has raised close to $6.4 billion in investments in the first three months of 2021 compared to just $697 million in the same quarter last year. Led by distress deals and investment spree of fintech players, private lenders (conventional NBFCs and fintech platforms) raised almost $6.1 billion funding in the first quarter of 2021. The $5.2 billion deal between Piramal Group and debt-ridden Dewan Housing and Hong Kong-based Ares SSG’s $380 million investment in Altico Capital led the pack making the sector an outlier in the quarter. Among growth capital deals, NBFC Five Star Business Finance raised $234 million from existing investors Sequoia Capital India and Norwest Venture Partners and new investors KKR and TVS Capital, turning a unicorn. Fintech player KreditBee raised $70 million in February and $75 million in January from marquee investors to close a Series C round of over $150 million- one of the largest for a lending startup. Interestingly, the startup also gave a full exit to its Chinese investors — Shunwei Capital and Xiaomi — with this. Gold loan platform Rupeek also continued its run with a Series E fundraise of $33 million led by GGV Capital. Arun Natarajan, founder, Venture Intelligence, said distress deals picked up by deep-pocketed global and local investors and growth capital raised by tech savvy NBFCs and fintech players led the pack in the first quarter on the back of expectation of an economic recovery.“As B2B companies attract private investment, platforms lending to small businesses are also getting the investor attention and emerging front runners in this segment,” he added. Madhusudan E, co-founder and CEO of KreditBee believes personal finance should “graduate from a luxurious aspiration to a trivial commodity” available at a click. “A complex demography like India requires simple, effective and impactful lending solutions that comes with a deeper understanding of the consumer financing needs of the ecosystem,” he said while closing his recent round. A recent Boston Consulting Group and FICCI report predicts that India is poised to clock a fintech sector valuation of $150-$160 billion by 2025 translating to an incremental value-creation potential of approx $100 billion. “To meet this ambition, India’s fintech sector will need investments of $20-25 billion over the next five years,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nbfcs-digi-lending-platforms-lead-pe-vc-funding-in-q1-2021/articleshow/81938302.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

The commercial vehicle financier said it aims to use the funds to achieve its target asset under management (AUM) of Rs 500 crore for the year from AUM of Rs 300 crore currently. Mahaveer Finance also said it is on track to raise Series C funding of Rs 100 crore by the year end, and is in discussions with multiple funds to finalise the same. “The company has reduced its leverage to around three times and is planning to use these funds to continue its growth,” Mahaveer Finance promoter Praveen Dugar, said. “The fund infusion would strengthen the firm’s balance sheet and will enable us to tap growth opportunities that continue to emerge in the current market towards our larger goal of Rs 2,000 crore in the next three years,” he added.Founded in 1981, the NBFC finances used commercial and passenger vehicles through a network of 42 branches. The company counts a network of over 35,000 small road transport operators, dealers, agents, and individuals and offers low-ticket loans in the range of Rs 3- Rs 4 lakh. Its typical loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is around 70%-80%, which ensures that borrowers have a significant equity investment in the vehicle. Till date, Mahaveer Finance has raised over Rs 350 crore in debt from various banks and financial institutions, and it also raised Rs 25 crore in equity from BanyanTree Growth Capital in 2018. “The company has established rigorous credit controls, portfolio monitoring systems and loan recovery systems, which reflects in its gross NPA levels, which is at par with industry benchmarks,” Ankur Bansal, co-founder of Blacksoil Capital, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mahaveer-finance-raises-rs-20-crore/articleshow/81938278.cms||---

The accused told the court the cousin was upset with him as he had made remarks about her character and she wanted to spite him. “In all, the prosecution has failed to produce on record cogent and reliable evidence,” the court held. It also observed that a child who had been subjected to such sexual violence would not insist on living with her father instead of the mother. The alleged incident took place in August 2020 and the man was arrested in October. The court further observed the accused had not engaged an advocate and had maintained that he was being falsely implicated at the instance of the relative. He had also denied all allegations levelled against him before a doctor. “It is brought on record that the accused being her father would take care of her, even focusing on her studies and cooking for her…So, it is not digestible and is difficult to believe that the father did any wrong thing with the prosecutrix,” the court said. The court observed there was no reason for the child not to narrate the incident to her mother when she visited her. “Prosecutrix (child) was not ready to go with her mother to Panvel when her mother asked her to. Not only the prosecutrix, but her other two sisters were also staying with their father,” the court pointed out. The court also observed that since the child was living with her cousin and the accused was behind bars since his arrest, this was not a case of the child being pressured by her parents to depose in favour of the father.

Bharat Kalaskar, regional transport officer, said, “It has been decided to reduce the number of applicants being called for tests on a daily basis. The staff strength at Nashik RTO has already been brought down to 50% as per government orders. Hence, it is also necessary to bring down the number of people coming to the RTO for their routine work.” The Nashik RTO witnesses around 200 applications for the driving license test and another 200 for the learner licence on a daily basis. Thus, the aim is to reduce it to 25%. The process of giving online appointment to only 100 applicants and on a daily basis is being initiated and at the same time, it is also being worked out to reschedule the appointments of applicants who have already being given appointments. Kalaskar said in near future they are planning to ask every person to take online appointment for any work before coming to the RTO so that the rush of people coming to the office is regularized. On the backdrop of increasing number of applicants who were not getting appointment for appearing the driving licence tests, the Nashik RTO had recently kept the office working on a public holiday and around 100 applicants took advantage of the same and appeared for the test.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/rto-online-appointment-for-driving-test-reduced-to-25/articleshow/81938214.cms||Santosh Sonawane

MSU had earlier approached the Prime Minister’s Office seeking Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s dates as chief guest for the convocation ceremony. “We wanted to call students offline as it is their function and receiving a degree in presentia is a lifetime opportunity. We kept on waiting for the situation during the ongoing Covid-19 induced pandemic to improve. But looking at the current situation, we do not see things improving for another couple of months.

Pandit said that since the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd (PMPML) buses were shut, he had no choice but to rely on autorickshaws because of the restrictions on movement from 6pm to 7am. He claimed the rickshaw driver charged him considerably more than the amount on the meter. Priti Shah, another traveller, faced similar overcharging by an autorickshaw driver during her commute to Pune railway station. “I had to reach the station by 6pm, the autorickshaw driver asked for more money and refused to charge as per the meter reading,” Shah said. Commuters have been complaining about being overcharged by autorickshaw and cab drivers ever since the new restrictions were imposed. They want authorities to intensify monitoring at bus and train terminals to prevent fleecing. As per the new rules, plying of PMPML buses has been stopped completely in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. Public movement on roads has been restricted between 6pm and 7am. The restrictions have impacted commute within the city, especially for outstation travellers coming to the city. Sanjay Kadam, who works as an agent with private bus operators, said that commuters have been facing challenges after arriving at the drop point. “Since the last three days, we are getting updates from commuters that they have faced problems in reaching the drop point. Commuters have been urging us to make arrangements, but we cannot do so because the new rules include restrictions on the number of passengers allowed in an autorickshaw or car,” Kadam said. A state government employee said that he has been facing issues to reach home after duty because of a lack of public transport. Vijay Rao, a traveller at Swargate, said that there has been chaos at the bus terminus as well as outside the terminus at Jedhe chowk. More monitoring is required, Rao said. The traffic police said that they are deploying more staff at the bus termini. Police teams are visiting these locations to check the status of local public transport. The checks will be intensified to prevent cases of overcharging and to ensure transporters follow the rules, an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/auto-drivers-overcharge-complaints-rise/articleshow/81938218.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Set up vax & test centres in industrial areas, MIDC’||MUMBAI: The government must set up vaccination and RT-PCR centres in industrial areas and MIDC estates, industry associations have demanded. Last week, a vaccination camp was organised on the Tata Motors campus in Pune where 1,000 workmen got jabs. Associations have also said industries should not be burdened with providing quarantine facilities and paying workers who cannot attend work when isolated. Meanwhile, industries stare at a four-day week as the government has announced a lockdown on weekends. Industries have their weekly off on Friday due to power shutdowns for regular maintenance.  “Though industries are allowed to operate all days, if there is a complete lockdown from 8pm Friday night to Monday 7am, then workmen and staff will not be able to travel to their place of work. Friday is the weekly holiday in the area. This in effect means a four-day working week. This will break the back of the industry,” said R Srinivasan, chief executive officer, TTC MIDC Industries Association, in an email to the state government. Srinivasan said the validity of RT-PCR tests must be for a month and not 15 days, and for workmen who show symptoms. “If workmen are covered under the Employees State Insurance Scheme (ESIS), then payment of wages for quarantine period must be borne by the Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC),” states the letter.  The association said MIDC must arrange e-passes for workers. P Anbalagan, CEO, MIDC, said travel passes are not required as the government order allows movement of factory workers. “They need to carry IDs. For vaccination and RT-PCR tests, we are coordinating with district authorities. We are taking up the issue of providing oxygen to industry with the government. Our field staff is coordinating with industry representatives.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-set-up-vax-test-centres-in-industrial-areas-midc/articleshow/81939191.cms||Clara Lewis

For years, Goswami had travelled 1km to and fro to fetch water. In the last week of February, she decided to remedy the situation herself and started digging near her house. She has finished digging till 25 feet and right now, the water level in the well is over 2 feet. For lack of resources, the well has not been paved. A wooden ladder goes down the well for one to get down and fetch water. Intrigued, people from surrounding villages are now visiting Simkhola to witness the result of Goswami’s efforts. Block development officer (BDO) Kishan Ram Arya said he will visit the spot and take stock of the situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/woman-in-water-scarcity-hit-area-in-almora-digs-25ft-well-by-herself/articleshow/81938217.cms||---

Gehlot said the Centre should issue unified standard operating procedure and allow people aged 18 and above to get the jab. Gehlot raised the issue of different states following different strategies and SOPs for containing the spread of he virus such as mandatory Covid test report from traavellers of other states, lockdown, night curfew, restrictions on education institutions, which shows lack of coordination among the states due to which people remain confused and fearful. Gehlot requested the PM that the country needs unified and concerted efforts to fight against the virus. Scaling up the vaccination drive in the state, the health department will seek cooperation of the government employees to get their relatives and people they know, who are above 45, get the jab. Health secretary Siddharth Mahajan held a meeting of the state task force on vaccination on Tuesday in which he directed the officials to take help of the employees of the state government and they should act as motivator to encourage people above 45 years to get the dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-to-pm-open-vax-drive-for-people-aged-18-above/articleshow/81939195.cms||---

Mayem lake attracts thousands of tourists every year. And since an extreme adventure sports facility, including bungee jumping, was introduced there in 2019, it has become even more popular.A senior officer said that they now want to develop a theme park there focusing on nature, which would be children and family-oriented. Interestingly, on three earlier occasions, GTDC has tried but failed to get a response from investors. And while economic conditions are not the most favourable, with even big theme parks running into losses, the official said GTDC is trying to chalk out a different model that will ensure the facility’s financial viability. “We don’t want the project to become a white elephant,” the official said. “The project is awaiting final permissions from the North Goa Planning and Development Authority as the Outline Development Plan 2021 has been challenged before the high court. Until that matter is resolved, the NOC cannot be issued,” a senior government officer said. Permissions are also being awaited from directorate of archives and archaeology and TCP’s conservation committee. The process of obtaining environmental clearance from the ministry of environment and forests has also been initiated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/soon-mayem-lake-to-have-eco-theme-park/articleshow/81940734.cms||---

Similar scenes are witnessed across the city as the Jaipur police have become strict on people not wearing masks while driving and walking on streets. Also, Jaipur police have planned to go for random checks to ensure adherence to social distancing norms . After the directions from chief minister Ashok Gehlot, police commissioner Jaipur Anand Srivastav on Tuesday directed all the DCPs, assistant commissioners and inspectors of Jaipur police to be strict with people not wearing masks and following social distancing. “We had done it in the past and seeing the increased cases, it is a must for everyone to wear masks. Thus , I have directed my men to ensure strict compliance of the Covid norms,” Srivastav said. Likewise, Jaipur police is also planning to distribute a mask to a violator found on the street while penalizing. “We are also planning to distribute a mask to a defaulter. While penalizing, we will also give him a mask to continue his further journey on the road. Hopefully with the help of NGOs and other social groups, we will be able to do it as we had done it in the past,” said Rahul Prakash, additional commissioner of police, law and order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cops-hold-random-checks-in-city-to-contain-virus-spread/articleshow/81939192.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Masks & social distancing back in mkts, but many still violate norms||Bhopal: The consistent appeal to people to wear masks for protection against Coronavirus is making an impact, particularly in new Bhopal areas. Social distancing in markets is back in vogue with circles drawn in front of shops and ropes insulating the shop from the shoppers. A survey from Trilanga to MP Nagar on Tuesday afternoon threw up some points: People are generally aware of the spurt in coronavirus cases and more than coronavirus, they appear to be scared of an “impending” lockdown. “It’s more than one year, we are facing this pandemic. When vaccines came in the beginning of the year and coronavirus cases also went down, we thought coronavirus and lockdown would become history but we are back to square one. In fact ,the figures are even worse now. I only hope people abide by Covid-19 protocol, we shall not be able to take another lockdown”, said a trader at 5 No. Stop market. Even as more people are wearing masks, there are some groups, which continue to be oblivious to both wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. People living in shanties in Trilanga could be seen sitting together on the road divider without wearing masks or observing social distancing. On Sunday lockdowns, there are more people sitting this way as they remain at home. It’s not shanties in Trilanga but everywhere in the city, where people are not abiding by Coronavirus guidelines. Apart from their callousness or lack of awareness on how lethal Coronavirus could prove to be, high prices of masks and sanitisers is also a major factor with them. “Selling masks and sanitisers has become a business. Even people sitting by the roadside selling masks charge you between Rs 30 to Rs 50 for a mask. A 500 ml bottle of sanitiser is being sold by medical shops for Rs 200 or even more. We can’t afford it. Moreover, it has to be bought again and again”, said Satish Devangan, who lives in a shanty. Youngsters are another group of people, who are still not complying with the “mandatory mask” rule. “ Most of my clients are youths. While some are very particular about wearing masks, a lot of them don’t wear it. They seem to believe they are immune to Coronavirus”, said Sanjeev, who runs an ice cream parlour. When asked whether he would not serve ice cream to customers not wearing masks as the chief minister has appealed traders to do, he said “We do try to persuade customers to wear masks but refusing to serve them order is little difficult”. At 10 No. market, a lot of shopkeepers have put up a request to customers to abide by Covid-19 protocol (now, the liquor shop also) and its impact can well be felt in the market, though the clientele in this market also comprises educated urbane families, which also contributes to greater compliance to Covid-19 norms. When liquor shops had opened following lockdown, there used to be a policeman sitting outside the shop to regulate the crowd of tipplers and ahatas attached to shops were closed. But, now there is nobody to regulate the crowd, which is a must particularly in the evening hours when there is tremendous rush in liquor shops and ahatas are also open. The practice of deploying a policeman at liquor shops must be resumed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/masks-social-distancing-back-in-mkts-but-many-still-violate-norms/articleshow/81938222.cms||---

---||Bhopal||With cases shooting up, Morena jostles for the jab||Bhopal: There has been a large turnout of people for inoculation in Morena. They fought among themselves to get the jab and when the vaccines exhausted, they raised slogans against the administration. Like other places, the number of corona positive cases has been shooting in this district located in the Chambal region of MP. From one in the last week of March, the covid 19 cases went up to 6 on April 4. It was 14 on April 5. And as the number of cases goes up, people rush to vaccination centres. Their number also went up after people of 45 year of age were allowed for the jabs. For the last few days, people are joining long queues similar to those witnessed at the box office of cinema halls on the first day of the release of a hit Bollywood movie, said a doctor involved in vaccination in Morena. In fact, similar scenes were witnessed in many other districts of the state. “ People when vaccines are exhausted and they are told to return”, said a doctor. The chief medical and health officer of Morena RC Bandil said, “Yes I know, people shout slogans and fight. On April 5 we were allocated 1810 vaccines and on April 6, their number was 16,000. We will ensure that every eligible person for the inoculation gets the jabs. He said that “ earlier the people were reluctant but now a large number of them are reaching coming”. The Congress state president and former chief minister Kamal Nath had also alleged that” there was shortage of vaccines and the government must ensure that the people get corona inoculation to check the pandemic”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/with-cases-shooting-up-morena-jostles-for-the-jab/articleshow/81938228.cms||---

At 55,469, it was the state’s second highest single-day case count. Of these cases, 10,040 were added in the city. Deaths numbered 297 in the state, the highest single-day figure in the nearly six months since October 16, when the number was 306. The total caseload in the state touched 31.1 lakh and the death toll rose to 56,330. The caseload in the city reached 4.7 lakh and deaths, 11,832. In the city, the BMC made efforts to increase the bed strength in each ward. “We have increased beds in our jumbo facilities and roped in nursing homes in every ward to ensure patients get care,” said BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. A senior doctor from a private hospital said 10,000 daily detections had the potential to cripple any healthcare system. “We may have healthcare to treat the worst-hit patients, but what about the numbers?” the doctor said. Even if a tenth of the daily detected patients need hospitalisation, the system will collapse within two weeks. “Each moderate to severe patient needs a week or two in hospital. It is overwhelming to consider how many beds we need,” the doctor said. Each of the expert teams from the Centre comprises a clinician and a public health expert and will tour one Covid-battered district for three to four days. All teams will send the Centre daily reports. Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said the teams would reach the state by Wednesday. The Centre justified the teams’ visit with statistics: the weekly case tally in the state has ballooned 14 times since the second week of February; from 3,051 cases registered in the February 10-16 week, 44,634 cases were detected between March 31 and April 6; deaths soared eight times from 31 in the second week of February to 250 between March 31 and April 6; of the total active cases in the country, 58% were from the state and 34% of the total deaths were from the state; there are over 4.7 lakh active cases in the state, of which 79,368 were stated to be in the city. Public health minister Rajesh Tope raised several issues with Union health minister Harsh Vardhan in a meeting. He said the Centre should direct neighbouring states where oxygen need for medical purposes was low to divert their supply here.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-24-hour-covid-count-in-state-breaches-55000-mark-again/articleshow/81940782.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Junior min slaps Covid hosp mess staffer over ‘scam’||NAGPUR: Minister of state and Akola guardian minister Bachchu Kadu slapped a mess staffer at Akola Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) for allegedly botching up food supply to Covid patients. Kadu, on a three-day Akola visit, conducted a surprise inspection of GMCH mess after videos of poor quality food had gone viral on social media. He interacted with cooks, workers and the contractor. Finding the quality of pulses poor, he asked how much pulses was cooked daily for the hospital, where more than 1,500 patients are. Contractor Sahebrao Kulmethe said they needed 10kg pulses daily. Kadu asked the same question to kitchen in-charge Sunil Morey, who said they cook not more than 6kg pulses daily. After inspection, Kadu got the contractor and employees together and again asked the question. This time, Morey said they cook 10kg pulses daily, which made Kadu angry. After repeatedly asking him to tell the truth, Kadu slapped Morey. Kadu, minister of state for water resources and school education, told TOI there was a “scam” at the mess. “A month’s supply of grains was demanded as per the register, but only eight days’ foodgrains were supplied. For eight months, there has been no record of foodgrains arriving at the district hospital for Covid patients,” said Kadu, adding that he had ordered an inquiry. “Instead of the slapping incident, one must concentrate on gross corruption noticed during inspection,” the minster said. Kadu tasked Akola sub-divisional officer Nilesh Apar with the inquiry. Sources said suspension was proposed. The person slapped was a contractual employee. “Does the rule of law exist in the state? How can a minister beat an employee over a meal issue?” tweeted BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar. “File a case against Bachchu Kadu for assaulting a government employee,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-junior-min-slaps-covid-hosp-mess-staffer-over-scam/articleshow/81940790.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Goa||Two Bengaluru FC players test positive||PANAJI: Bengaluru FC are sweating over the availability of two key players for next week’s AFC Cup playoff after they tested positive for Covid-19. Bengaluru face Nepal Club Army in the preliminary round two of the AFC Cup at the GMC Athletic Stadium in Bambolim on April 14. The club must register players before midnight on Wednesday. But with a key foreign player among those who tested positive for the infection during the preparatory camp in Goa, the former Indian Super League champions have been left with a difficult choice. “Maybe Bengaluru will have to take a chance and register the players,” a source told TOI on Wednesday. “The club has now tested all the players again, hoping that this time around there is a change in result. If the test results remain the same, then nothing can be done.” Bengaluru were scheduled to play FC Goa in a friendly on Wednesday, but with three positives – including a staffer – the match was cancelled. All players are now isolating and will resume training after the test results. “One of the players had done an Antigen test (earlier) which showed a positive result, but when a RT-PCR test was done, he tested negative. There have been false positives in some cases (in the past),” said another official. The club’s positive tests created some panic at FC Goa, who played a friendly against Bengaluru on Monday. The Juan Ferrando coached side are preparing for the high-profile AFC Champions League which starts next week and heaved a huge sigh of relief after all players tested negative. “We continuously test our players. We did another round of testing today and all of them were negative. The club didn’t train; we were anyway scheduled to play a game (against Bengaluru),” said the club official. Goa will become the first Indian club to participate in the group stage of the AFC Champions League when they face Qatar’s Al-Rayyan SC – coached by France World Cup winner Laurent Blanc – on April 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/two-bengaluru-players-test-positive/articleshow/81957326.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Slot-booking mandatory for property registration in April||PUNE: Citizens planning to register their properties this month would have to book time slots at the registration office concerned through the e-step-in facility, following stringent restrictions on movement of people under the Maharashtra government’s Break the Chain order to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The slot-booking process would ensure that each of the 519 registration offices in the state carry out a maximum of 25-30 registrations daily, indicating a sharp decline in the government’s revenue in the first month of the new financial year. A senior official of the registration department said, “Only a few homebuyers might step out under such restrictions after booking slots online, affecting the revenue collection at the onset of the new fiscal.” A resident of Kondhwa has decided to do exactly that. The homebuyer had earlier planned to register the property in April. “Now, I am planning to wait and watch,” she said. The 519 registration offices in the state would operate from 10am to 6pm from Monday to Friday in April. They would be closed in the weekend, following the weekend curfew order. The homebuyers having paid their stamp duty before March and those who have to pay it and register properties this month would have to follow the same procedure for booking the slots through the e-step-in facility, said another senior official of the registration department. They would have to visit the state’s property registration website to book the time slots and get a confirmation on the allotted time slot. “The notification about the booked slot has to be shown while going to the registration office. Only those who have to be present for the registration process would be allowed inside to ensure minimum footfall at the registration offices,” said inspector-general of registration and controller of stamps Shravan Hardikar on Tuesday. He encouraged developers to go for e-registration of new properties from their own offices to reduce footfall at the sub-registrars’offices. Credai representatives stressed that the withdrawal of the stamp duty waiver (only women to get 1% concession) and the new restrictions would definitely affect the registrations and impact the overall realty business in the state. National vice-president of Credai Shantilal Kataria told TOI, “Till March, the government did see high registrations and the stamp duty waiver had given some momentum to the realty market. We are urging the government to reconsider our request for continuing with the stamp duty concession in the present situation. If the state government is announcing that the restrictions should not affect the economy, they should take due steps for the same.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/slot-booking-mandatory-for-property-registration-in-april/articleshow/81938232.cms||Nisha Nambiar

And among the tribal art, Gond art has its own quirky motifs, depictions and styles, which are on play currently at the Tribal Museum. Current surge of Covid-19 has stirred a storm once again and along with various restrictions and stricter vigil, pandemic blues are also back with a vengeance. The ongoing exhibition titled Shalaka-13, basically showcases the works of Gond artist Rajendra Kumar Shyam, and gives a peek into the lifestyles of tribals and their fascination with colours - the brighter the better- and gives you a colourful respite from the negativity unleashed by the pandemic. For Rajendra, these lines and dots of Gond art that connect beautifully to create a melange of life, have a special meaning. “These are the colours and patterns that have given our tribe a distinct identity, internationally. They have been a part of my growing up years when I saw my grandmother, mother and aunts colouring every piece of wall, door, window with hues that brought immense joy and became a way of life for us.” The artist uses dark tones prominently and sets them off with the use of some earthy undertones. When asked about this particular style, he said, “Bright colours come naturally to me, so they usually remain the most dominating part of my work, but to ensure that they don’t lean towards gaudy, I reach out to serene palettes and earthy tints to create a fine balance.” Currently, there are over 23 works ( large and medium) on display at Tribal Museum, but most of them showcase various kinds of animals. Rajendra explained his special affinity and said, “Wildlife is a passion of mine, in fact animals of all kinds attract me, that is why they are at the core of each display.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/melange-of-earthy-colours-at-tribal-museum/articleshow/81938252.cms||Vinita Chaturvedi

However, not all patients are clear about when they started getting symptoms: some get one-day fever followed by severe cough while others begin with blocked nose.Infectious diseases specialist Dr Om Shrivastava from Jaslok Hospital said one of the reasons for the false negative could be the fact that the RT-PCR test, which is considered the best to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has a sensitivity between 65 and 70%. “Tests are not 100% positive, but just because a test is unable to pick up the virus, one cannot exclude the infection. Doctors have to rely on their clinical judgement,” he said.At such times, doctors have to depend on the CT scan of the chest to establish the diagnosis. The Covid lung has a distinctive glassy appearance that cannot be missed, said Samdhani. “The best time to order a CT scan would be between Day 7 and 11 when the risk of a cytokine storm is high,” he added.Infectious diseases specialist Dr Anita Mathew from Fortis Hospital, Mulund, said sampling technique is one of the most common reasons for negative test result. “If the sampling isn’t done right and the right amount of sample isn’t picked, it could impact the result,” she said.Amid worries about new variants, doctors pointed out that the presence of variants wouldn’t impact basic testing. “PCR tests look at the DNA of an organism. The DNA of SARS-CoV-2 is still the same, with some mutations that need advanced genome sequencing for detection,” said Mathew.BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said false negatives occur but they are rare. “If a patient is symptomatic, it is advisable to start with an antigen test. If the result is positive, it is 100% diagnosis that doesn’t need a RT-PCR follow-up,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/despite-classic-covid-symptoms-some-testing-negative/articleshow/81941302.cms||---

The state recorded 71.79% voter turnout at the end of 12-hour polling amid the Covid pandemic. The voter turnout was 74.24% in the 2016 assembly election. Kallakurichi district topped the list with a voter turnout of 78%, followed by Namakkal (77.91%) and Ariyalur (77.88%). Chennai trailed with 59.4% turnout. “This is an approximate figure obtained over phone (from districts). Polling percentage will increase slightly,” chief electoral officer Satyabrata Sahoo said. The state recorded 74.24% polling in 2016 assembly election and saw the ruling AIADMK recording a consecutive victory. On Tuesday, Covid-infected voters, including DMK MP Kanimozhi, exercised their franchise during the last hour of polling. Sahoo said there were no reports of untoward incidents that warranted repolling in booths. A decision, however, would be taken when the returning officers make their recommendation after scrutiny on Wednesday along with the observers and the representatives of political parties. The reports would be sent to the election commission for further action. “There were no major complaints of law and order problems. There were fewer complaints about EVMs and VVPATs,” the officer said. Less than 1% of EVMs had reported technical snag. AIADMK MP O P Raveendranath Kumar’s car was damaged in a stone pelting incident at Perumalkavundanpatti in Bodinayakanur assembly segment in Theni district, where his father and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam is in the fray. The AIADMK cadres resorted to roadblock urging the police to arrest the perpetrators. A scuffle in Thondamuthur in Coimbatore district where minister S P Velumani is contesting, allegations of voter bribing by BJP and violation of model code of conduct by its candidate Vanathi Srinivasan marked the otherwise peaceful and smooth polling in Coimbatore district. Tension gripped Selvapuram falling in Thondamuthur constituency in the morning as AIADMK cadres surrounded DMK candidate Karthikeya Sivasenapathy who visited a polling station. As they hurled abuses against him, DMK cadres picked up a quarrel. As the cadres of two parties came close to exchanging blows Sivasenapathy left the place in his car. In Coimbatore south, MNM chief Kamal Haasan alleged that bribing of voters was rampant even on polling day. Kamal lodged a complaint with election officials, alleging that political parties were distributing tokens to be exchanged for cash after the polling. “People are queuing up in large numbers in polling booths for voting. But outside token distribution is in full swing,’’ he said. Three people returning to Virudhunagar to cast their votes died in an accident as their van collided with a mini truck on the Usilampatti-Sedapatti road. Five people waiting to cast their vote in a noon meal scheme building at Kandilan in Mudukulathur constituency, Ramanathapuram, suffered injuries as a portion of the building fell on them. Sahoo said the flying squads and surveillance teams will not seize cash and other materials from Wednesday onwards. Further relaxations of model code of conduct will be known by the election commission. The commission has provided high security to 75 counting centres in the state until May 2, with CAPF and state police taking care of the first two rounds, besides round-the-clock CCTV surveillance. Sahoo said the commission had taken a lot of safety measures owing to Covid, including providing PPE kits, to Covid-infected persons. “Voters also came to booths wearing masks since morning with great interest. This 71.79% voter turnout is good,” the CEO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tn-election-ends-peacefully-with-voter-turnout-of-71-79/articleshow/81942498.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Jaipur||Shelter home for transgenders to come up in Jaipur||JAIPUR: Taking a step towards giving transgenders a dignified life, a shelter home for transgenders will soon come up in the city. ‘Garima Grah’ will provide accommodation to 25 homeless transgenders in Jaipur. It is a novel initiative and will be developed under a central government project and the district collector has been given directions for the same. The aim is to provide a house to homeless transgenders and to give them some skill training for a degnified life. The community faces innumerable prejudices in the society. The project is being launched by Ministry of Social Justice and Welfare in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Patna, Kolkata, Jaipur, Raipur, Bhubaneswar and Manipur. This is a pilot project after which it will be launched in other parts of the country. NGO Nai Bhor working for the rights of transgender community in Rajasthan is incharge of the project. For them, the struggle of hunting for a place is real. Pushpa Mai, head of Nai Bhor, said, "I have been hunting for a rented place but the moment the word transgender or ‘kinnar’ is uttered, people immediately back off. It’s been a few days but there has been no success. The centuries-old prejudices against the community have been a big hurdle to find a space. We are also part of the society then why are we not accepted?" The aim of the organization is to train the transgenders in skills like – make-up, cookery, carpentery, etc. There are many transgenders that are disowned by their family members and some leave willingly due to isolation their family has to face. For such people, this shelter home can be a ray of hope.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/shelter-home-for-transgenders-to-come-up-in-city/articleshow/81939212.cms||---

The breakdown report of 2020-21 alone shows a total of 373 such instances. The report was shared by transport minister Mauvin Godinho at the recent assembly session in response to a question tabled by Aleixo Lourenco Reginaldo. The largest number of breakdowns, 104 instances, were due to issues in the transmission system. Problems in the engine, 91 instances, came a close second. The report also revealed that there were no breakdowns due to the problems with the axle during this period. In the same response, Godinho said that 408 vehicles were purchased for the KTC since March 2012. A total of 127 KTC buses will be replaced in the next three years, he said. These are mini buses, luxury buses, semi-luxury buses and long buses that were manufactured in 2012 and 2013. The mini buses had cost the KTC Rs 16.5 lakh while the most expensive vehicles cost nearly Rs 31 lakh. Godinho said that the projected loss was 2,509 lakh in 2020-21. The revenue earned in 2019-20 was Rs 20,481.87 lakh, therefore showing a loss of 6.19% that fiscal year. The reasons for revenue loss, Godinho said, were salary costs for KTC employees, bus fares being regulated, the operation of social obligatory routes and competition with private operators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ktc-reported-breakdown-of-373-buses-in-2020-21/articleshow/81940816.cms||---

There were fewer complaints about EVMs and VVPATs,” the officer said. Less than 1% of EVMs had reported technical snag. AIADMK MP O P Raveendranath Kumar’s car was damaged in a stone pelting incident at Perumalkavundanpatti in Bodinayakanur assembly segment in Theni district, where his father and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam is in the fray. The AIADMK cadres resorted to roadblock urging the police to arrest the perpetrators. A scuffle in Thondamuthur in Coimbatore district where minister S P Velumani is contesting, allegations of voter bribing by BJP and violation of model code of conduct by its candidate Vanathi Srinivasan marked the otherwise peaceful and smooth polling in Coimbatore district. Tension gripped Selvapuram falling in Thondamuthur constituency in the morning as AIADMK cadres surrounded DMK candidate Karthikeya Sivasenapathy who visited a polling station. As they hurled abuses against him, DMK cadres picked up a quarrel. As the cadres of two parties came close to exchanging blows Sivasenapathy left the place in his car. In Coimbatore south, MNM chief Kamal Haasan alleged that bribing of voters was rampant even on polling day. Kamal lodged a complaint with election officials, alleging that political parties were distributing tokens to be exchanged for cash after the polling. “People are queuing up in large numbers in polling booths for voting. But outside token distribution is in full swing,’’ he said. Three people returning to Virudhunagar to cast their votes died in an accident as their van collided with a mini truck on the Usilampatti-Sedapatti road. Five people waiting to cast their vote in a noon meal scheme building at Kandilan in Mudukulathur constituency, Ramanathapuram, suffered injuries as a portion of the building fell on them. Sahoo said the flying squads and surveillance teams will not seize cash and other materials from Wednesday onwards. Further relaxations of model code of conduct will be known by the election commission. The commission has provided high security to 75 counting centres in the state until May 2, with CAPF and state police taking care of the first two rounds, besides round-the-clock CCTV surveillance. Sahoo said the commission had taken a lot of safety measures owing to Covid, including providing PPE kits, to Covid-infected persons. “Voters also came to booths wearing masks since morning with great interest. This 71.79% voter turnout is good,” the CEO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/tn-election-ends-peacefully-with-voter-turnout-of-71-79/articleshow/81942502.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Only Nagapattinam (69.6%) recorded a turnout below 70%.Out of 41 constituencies in the region, DMK and AIADMK had direct fights with each other in most of the segments while their allies CPI, CPM, BJP, PMK, and VCK tested their might in a few constituencies.

The number was steady till noon after which there was a mild decline but it picked up in the end. It was the case in almost all the districts in the region.

The issue was brought to light by Kiran Satyendra, a senior citizen residing in the area, using TOI’s citizen reporter app. According to Satyendra, residents in the area were having a tough time because of the smell that made it difficult for commuters to pass through the area. Residents also feared that the drain might overflow and flood the colony during the ensuing monsoon season. "The open drain which passes through the Mansarovar road was being choked with waste. Apart from the smell and mosquito problem, last year during rains, the entire area was flooded with drain water as the garbage was restricting the flow. We were dreading a similar situation this year as well but thanks to the authorities and TOI, the issue has now been solved," said Satyendra. A commuter who regularly uses the road said that the difference is evident as the stretch does not smell of garbage like earlier. "I think they have solved the problem for now by removing the garbage. It would be good if they lay proper drain lines in the area and close this one soon to solve the issue permanently," said Supriya Kumar, an IT employee. Another resident of the area, Sharan Kumar also complained that they had to lock themselves inside their houses when the drain overflowed last year. GHMC officials said apart from clearing the froth and garbage, officials of the Kukatpally zone are currently widening the existing drain to ensure there is no inundation during monsoons. "To direct the flood water passing from the upstream areas towards Hasmathpet Lake, the existing storm water drain is being widened to avoid inundation in future," said a civic official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/garbage-from-alwal-drain-cleared-within-48-hours/articleshow/81939205.cms||---

Hailing from Mela Kalkandarkottai, he was supposed to cast his vote in MK Kottai higher secondary school, under the Thiruverumbur assembly segment. On Tuesday morning at the polling booth, the election officials took his EPIC number and read it out loud for the booth agents to record. “One of the agents said that my vote was already cast and I was totally clueless. I had spent Rs 50,000 in scheduling my travel to cast my vote,” Ramesh said.After an argument with the election officials, he was given an opportunity to vote using the traditional ballot and stamp under section 49P after providing proof for photo and address. The process took him 30 minutes. “I have insisted the election officials to check the CCTV footage to find out who had cast my vote in a fraudulent way,” Ramesh added. Election officials said they will inquire into the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/gulf-returnee-finds-his-vote-already-cast/articleshow/81940760.cms||Deepak Karthik

Though spectators are not allowed for the IPL matches, the residents fear similar crowds could gather at the stadium, near where many buildings are sealed due to Covid cases, said a letter written to CM Uddhav Thackeray on April 2 by Asit Shroff, a resident of D Road, just across the Wankhede Stadium.Shroff, also a member of the Marine Drive Residents’ Association, requested for the matches to be shifted to another venue in a non-residential area. “The state government is compelled to restrict religious and other social activities like marriages, deaths etc. and contrary to this, in these difficult times, IPL cricket matches of such magnitude lasting over several days is permitted,” he added.Mahendra Hemdev, another D Road resident, said: “Every year during the matches, there are parking restrictions, which make it difficult for the senior residents and is unacceptable in these times of Covid.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/residents-near-wankhede-write-to-cm-to-shift-ipl-games/articleshow/81940903.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Chennai||Men caught with two EVMs in Chennai; not used for polling, says CEO||CHENNAI: Four individuals found carrying two electronic voting machines (EVMs) and one VVPAT machine on twowheelers in Velachery soon after the poll on Tuesday sparked outrage, with the DMK and the Congress accusing a serious breach of protocol. Cash worth Rs 1.12 lakh was also found on them. Chief electoral officer Satyabrata Sahoo said that as per their preliminary inquiry, the motorists were corporation employees and the EVMs they were carrying were not the ones used for polling. “Detailed inquiry is on. As per preliminary findings of the DEO, these two (machines) were not polled EVMs. We will take strict action on any violation of SOPs,” Sahoo said. It all started when a food delivery agent noticing the machines being transported on two bikes confronted the riders after one of the machines fell down on Taramani main road in Velachery. As the news spread, a group of DMK and Congress functionaries rushed to the spot and picked up an argument. C V Elango, a DMK functionary, said that even as they were verifying the identity of the men, police reached the scene and took them away saying they need to investigate the matter. “They were wearing ‘Polling Official’ badges, but we suspect them to be AIADMK workers, he said. Velachery police station witnessed tense moments as hundreds of cadres from the DMK and the Congress gathered outside the station. Police said the motorists were revenue department officials and senior officials were holding talks with Congress candidate Hasan Maulaana and senior DMK functionaries. Former DMK Mayor Ma Subramanian, who held a long meeting with police and polling officials at the station, said the individuals were poll officials, but he had asked the election commission to verify their call records to identify if there was any wrongdoing. “We seek a fair probe into the matter and a re-election for the concerned booth from where the machines were transported. We also want legal and departmental action against the officers concerned,” Subramanian said. Regarding the cash, Subramanian said the poll officials have told them that the cash was meant for staff salary and they have sought an investigation on that too. DMK functionaries will meet chief election officer Satyabrata Sahoo on Wednesday. TNCC president K S Alagiri questioned Sahoo’s stand on Velachery EVM episode, and said: “Since afternoon, we have complained about removal of names of DMK supporters from the voters list in Velachery. Inaction was his answer. Now, EVMs have been seized from unauthorized people,” said Alagiri demanding immediate action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/men-caught-with-two-evms-in-city-not-used-for-polling-says-ceo/articleshow/81940808.cms||Srikkanth D
---||Kochi||Covid testing below half of promised 1 lakh||KOCHI: Forget about the 1 lakh Covid tests/day that CM Pinarayi Vijayan promised at the beginning of 2021. As the poll date came closer, Kerala reduced its testing numbers to almost half of what was promised. In the first five days of April, the state – on an average – conducted around 47,254 tests/day. In January 2021, Kerala — on an average — conducted 55,290 tests/day. It jumped to 66,085 (avg) tests/day in February. In March, as most of the healthcare workers got busy with vaccination and poll-related activities increased in state, testing dipped to 54,277 (avg) tests/day. As poll date came closer, the number of samples sent for testing gradually dropped from 54,347 on April 1 to 51,783 on April 2, 44,779 on April 3, 45,171 on April 4 and 40,191 on April 5. Though Kerala never met the promised Covid testing target of 1 lakh, it improved its RT-PCR testing. Now 55-60% tests conducted are RT-PCRs. In contrast, in February, almost 65-70% tests were the less-reliable antigen tests. But, it is pertinent to note that compared to other states, Kerala has done better when it comes to Covid testing. “Kerala consistently tested 55,000 to 60,000 people (avg) each day and by March 31, it had tested 36% of its population and 3.64 lakhs/million population, the highest among all mega states after J&K. Andhra Pradesh tested 2.78 lakhs/million population, Karnataka tested 3.25 lakhs/million population and Tamil Nadu 2.56 lakhs/million population. This has helped Kerala identify the vulnerable population at the earliest and isolate them before the virus could spread,” said Mysore Sanjeev, convener, Project Jeevan Raksha that came out with monthly Covid projections for each state during the initial months of the first Covid wave. However, public health experts in state said that Kerala can’t afford to relax at the moment when the rest of India is seeing a spike in cases and there is no restriction in interstate travel. “This is the time we need to focus majorly on testing. We can’t let our guard down. In most government hospitals, doctors are still asked to collect swabs. Government doctors are overburdened with Covid and non-Covid duties and the vaccination drive. It is time for the government to approve trained persons, especially paramedical staff, to collect swabs just like in the rest of the country,” said Kerala Government Medical Officers' Association president Dr Vijayakrishnan GS. “What do we stand to benefit with increased testing now, when the government has almost-completely stopped contact tracing and ensuring strict quarantine of positive persons and their contacts? It all goes together,” said Dr Jayakrishnan AV, chairman, Indian Medical Association’s committee for vaccination promotion and coordination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/covid-testing-below-half-of-promised-1l/articleshow/81938266.cms||Preetu Nair

Interestingly, the citizen who made the video was originally stopped by the cops and fined on Monday near the junction on Jamnagar Road for having a fancy registration plate. He paid his fine, but suddenly noticed three two-wheelers belonging to the policemen there. While one did not have a registration plate, two others had fancy plates. He made a video of the motorcycles on his mobile phone and circulated the clip among his friends which soon became viral on social media. When senior traffic officials came across the video, the three policemen were asked for an explanation. Since one of the cops had purchased his scooter only four days ago, he was not fined, but the two had to pay the penalty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/2-rajkot-cops-fined-for-fancy-number-plates/articleshow/81937504.cms||---

Health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, in an interview to ANI, also clarified his remarks that the objective of vaccination is to inoculate those who need and not those who want it after the comments kicked up a controversy online with several commentators wondering how such a distinction can be drawn and whether the government was tied down by an overly bureaucratic approach. Bhushan said in the current phase of vaccinations till July, vaccines will be in limited supply and this meant that priorities had to be drawn up to protect those most vulnerable. He said the country is following a dynamic demandsupply model and adjusting coverage accordingly, making sure the healthcare system can deliver the targets set. The secretary said the focus was to reduce mortalities as this would be a figure that will hold attention once the pandemic passes. He said discussions were on with Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech over increasing production and offering government help by way of financial assistance, new facilities and rapid approvals. He said states had been allowed considerable leeway to innovate and set up facilities and explore means to quicken vaccinations. “The primary objective is to reduce deaths and protect the healthcare system involved in combating the pandemic,” Bhushan said. Sources said efforts were on increase capacities so that there could be a further expansion of eligible beneficiaries. But in the meanwhile, the government did not want a situation where second dose supplies fell short. India — which started its mega vaccination drive on January 16 with health and front line workers prioritised for receiving the jabs in the first round — has administered over 8.4 crore doses till Tuesday 8 pm, which includes first dose to over 5.44 crore people of 45 years and above of age. From April 1, the government allowed all those 45 and above to receive Covid vaccine, irrespective of co-morbidities. Bhushan said India has been fastest in ramping up of vaccination with over 7.9 crore doses administered in merely 79 days, whereas the US — which has the highest daily rate of doses administered – has taken 112 days to give 16.5 crore doses. United Kingdom — one of the first to start vaccination – has given only 3.6 crore doses in 118 days. Pointing out that India has lowered vaccination age to 45, officials cited data to show several western countries with advanced facilities have not opened vaccination to all beyond age 50. ‘||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/priority-for-vaccination-based-on-scientific-principles-says-govt/articleshow/81942152.cms||Sushmi Dey

While UK has prioritised those between 16-64 years, it is only for those with underlying health conditions and unpaid carers for the elderly and disabled. Similarly Australia has opened it for adults but with underlying disability or medical condition. Citing figures culled from international data websites, Bhushan said the US was targeting people in the 65-75 years bracket till mid-April. Sweden and Switzerland, which have among the most advanced healthcare, are still only targeting the 65 plus groups, in Australia it is 70 plus and aboriginals. Officials also underlined that it is not yet sorted whether faster administration of vaccine can build herd immunity.

But as the city struggles to live sustainably with a virus not showing signs of going away, the need for rapid shifts in public mobility spurred the powers-that-be to seize on the Covid-19 crisis and improve cycling and pedestrian infrastructure as a physically distant, active, and low-carbon mode of travel. “As people realised during lockdown, cycles were a safe and effective way to move around. So did we.

The body was identified to be that of Rohit, 22, of Salempur area who was reported missing following an accident a couple of days ago. Police now claim that Rohit was most likely murdered by his friend, Vinay Kumar Sharma, who reported a fake accident to misguide police. Earlier, Vinay had alerted police, saying that he and Rohit had met with an accident while they were on a motorcycle. Vinay had claimed that Rohit had disappeared. “Prima facie, we believe that Vinay murdered Rohit and his body was abandoned in a field,” said Santosh Kumar, Bulandshahr senior superintendent of police. Vinay is at large. Police said they will ascertain the motive of the murder only after Vinay's arrest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/missing-after-accident-youths-partially-charred-body-found/articleshow/81937515.cms||---
---||Goa||FC Goa leave out Angulo, Noguera for AFC Champions League||Panaji: The highest goal scorer and assists provider in the Indian Super League (ISL) will both have no roles to play for FC Goa in the group stages of the AFC Champions League, starting next week. Goa had six foreign players this season in the ISL, but with the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) rules allowing for a maximum of four, including one mandatorily from its member nation, coach Juan Ferrando had a difficult choice to make. Ferrando has now made that decision and it means he cannot accommodate Igor Angulo and Alberto Noguera. “Without a doubt, it was a difficult choice and the coach explained his decision to the players,” a source told TOI on Wednesday, the deadline day for final registration of players. Angulo scored 14 goals in the recently-concluded ISL, the same as ATK Mohun Bagan striker Roy Krishna. But the Spanish sharpshooter walked away with the Golden Boot since he had played lesser minutes. Noguera picked up the Winning Pass of the Season award for his eight assists, the same as Krishna, but with fewer appearances. “It is a difficult moment because they play hard, even in training. Rule exists in Asian Champions League and it is difficult. They love the club, they are hard-working, but this is life of football,” the Spanish coach had told TOI on Tuesday. With Goa playing Asian heavyweights in the ACL, Ferrando has clearly opted to tighten his defence with Ivan Gonzalez getting the nod. He will partner Australian centre-back James Donachie, an automatic choice due to the 3+1 rule. Jorge Ortiz can play in multiple attacking positions and will now be expected to fill the void left by Angulo’s absence. The Spanish winger has played as a forward and as a false nine this season. Captain Edu Bedia completes the foreign quartet, getting the nod ahead of Noguera due to his ability to hold on to the ball and bring some stability to the midfield. He is also the longest-serving foreign player at the club. Goa will become the first Indian club to participate in the group stage of the AFC Champions League when they face Qatar’s Al-Rayyan SC – coached by 1998 French World Cup-winning centre-back Laurent Blanc -- on April 14. Last year’s finalists Persepolis FC from Iran is the other team, while the group will be completed with the winner of the playoff between Al-Wahda (UAE) and Al-Zawraa (Iraq).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-leave-out-angulo-noguera-for-afc-champions-league/articleshow/81957345.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

It was on this day that Mahatma Gandhi’s Dandi March had ended and the BJP was constituted. It is a happy coincidence that on 6 April, we are sitting in front of the Gandhi statue for "Swasthya Agraha"."Mahatma Gandhi liberated the country by Satyagraha. Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, cleaned the country through "Swachch Agraha". In this sequence, today I am in front of Mahatma Gandhi’s statue for "Swasthya Agraha", he said. Chouhan informed that a cabinet meeting will also be held to control Corona infection during the "Swasthya Agraha" event. Besides, a discussion will also be held with prominent people, business organizations, volunteer groups, people associated with the education industry, transportation business, Corona volunteers, roadside vendors etc. from various parts of the state.The chief minister said that a healthy body is the first joy. Corona infection has affected the country and the whole world. This is a disease that can't be controlled only by efforts made by the government. This battle can't be won without the cooperation of the society, as the infection only spreads due to people not adhering to appropriate behaviour suggested in the light of Coronavirus pandemic. Chouhan said that the society will have to be aware to prevent infection. "I am here today to make a moral request to the society. Presently, people of the state are not in the habit of wearing mask. It is true that the rate of Coronavirus infection in the country had come down. Besides, the advent of the vaccine has made people become reckless, due to which the infection once again starting spread rapidly.He further said that lockdown is a simple way to prevent infection. But lockdown can destroy our economy. People will become unemployed. "I do not consider lockdown to be the right solution. Limited lockdown is fine, permanent lockdown is not the solution to prevent infection", he said.In fact, it is actually a crime, because by not wearing masks, we are putting others also along with ourselves at risk. Therefore, this sense of responsibility must be developed in people.The chief minister said that on Monday, he made all his family members wear masks. Let us all resolve that we shall put on mask and no member of our family will leave the house without a mask.Chouhan said that for him the mask means M for Mera, A for Aapka, S for Suraksha and K for Kawach ‘Mera Aapka Suraksha Kawach’. We have to run this campaign that ‘Mask Nahin to Baat Nahin’, when you go to the shop and if there is no mask, then the shopkeeper should say ‘Mask Nahin to Samaan Nahi’. It is a campaign to create awareness.Chouhan appealed to the media to cooperate in this respect and said that media is a very effective medium through which awareness can be created. Chouhan also appealed to religious leaders, social workers, political parties, activists and all institutions to join this campaign. Together we can fight against Corona and prevent its spread.The chief minister said that ‘Mein Corona Volunteer’ campaign has been started. This means that people should register themselves as Corona volunteers. They can call 181 and register at mp.mygov.in. These volunteers can register themselves as vaccination volunteers and medical facility volunteers . Along with this, mask awareness volunteers will work to prevent, motivate, urge people to wear masks and make masks available. Mohalla organizations will be helpful in voluntary home quarantine and institutional quarantine. Interested persons can register for these activities on CM Helpline and 181.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/cms-swasthya-agraha-on-covid-appropriate-behaviour/articleshow/81938259.cms||---

There are a total 1,498 projects registered with RERA across the state. However, the authority received QPR of approximately 150 projects.” The order issued by RERA also reads, if a project has been completed, QPRs need to be submitted for all quarters, up to and including, the quarter in which the completion certificate has been obtained. “Since June 1, 2013, the time RERA came into force, 218 projects have been issued completion certificates and approximate 500 projects whose deadline is completed will apply soon.

Apart from plotted schemes, promoters of housing schemes will have to pay Rs 10 per square-metre as a standard fee. An official said, “Earlier, builders had to pay Rs 20 per square-metre as standard fee, which has been reduced to Rs 10 per square-metre. The calculation of the standard fee will be done on the basis of phase-area. In projects, where built-up area is higher than phase- area , the standard fee will be calculated on the basis of built-up area,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/realtors-can-file-progress-report-by-may-31/articleshow/81939218.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Four months on, five booked for murder||VADODARA: Four months after an electrician from Sherkhi village was killed, police booked five persons for plotting and executing his murder on Monday. The offence was registered at Vadodara Taluka police station against Mukesh Parmar, his wife Nikita Parmar, his father Manhar Parmar, mother Ramila Parmar and a man named Jagdish Gohil. The deceased Mela Gohil’s wife Sumitra approached police after Nikita’s sister Nisha told her about the murder conspiracy. On April 4, when Ramila met Nisha, she told her about her suspicion and the latter spilled the beans about how the four family members had killed Mela. “Based on the complaint, we have registered an offence, but we are yet to arrest the accused since we are collecting evidence and also verifying the post-mortem report,” said a police official. In her complaint, Sumitra alleged that Mukesh, Nikita, Manhar and Ramila planned the murder as Mela had become demanding in his extra-marital relationship with Ramila and on several occasions he had tried to molest Nikita. Police said that family members of both Mela and Ramila knew about their illicit relationship, but they did not have any issues. However, the changed behaviour of Mela at Ramila’s house irked the killers. On November 14, 2020, when Mela went to Ramila’s house, the accused served him a glass of DDT-infested toddy. After consuming the toddy, Mela died and the accused took his body in Gohil’s auto-rickshaw to Koyali-Sindhrot road and dumped it on the side of the road near Mini River. Mela’s bike was also kept beside his body to make it look like an accidental death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/four-months-on-five-booked-for-murder/articleshow/81937521.cms||---

One Himanshu had filed an RTI on July 15, 2019, seeking details of some documents in the local body office. Since he was not given the required information, he appealed before the information commission (IC) office. The IC served three notices to Baran commissioner office directing to relay the information. The notices fell on deaf ears as the office didn’t respond to any of the notices. Similarly, Baran commissioner office didn’t release the information sought by one Prashant Mittal under two separate applications and ignored the notices served by IC office. The commissioner was told to appear before the commission. But he ignored the order and finally was given 15 days to respond. After the deadline ended, he was slapped with penalty. Information commissioner Narain Bareth slapped a penalty of Rs 10,000 for each of the three charges on commissioner of Baran local body. "Undermining the notices served by the competent authority is akin to disrespect of the RTI law," said Bareth. Similarly, the information commissioner has slapped Rs 10,000 penalty on assistant engineer mining in Sarwar for not providing information sought by one Sitaram Gupta on March 5, 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/officials-penalised-for-not-providing-info-under-rti/articleshow/81939217.cms||---

Through this scheme, handicraft, artisans and entrepreneurs of the state are being linked with employment by providing them with skill development and world-class designing assistance and technology along with financial assistance and marketing.” He said that despite their talent and hard work, the youth of the state had been sidelined for years, but through the ODOP scheme, millions of job opportunities have been generated for the youth. “Some popular products, including the flute manufactured in Pilibhit, terracotta of Gorakhpur, wheat stalk handicraft of Bahraich, kala namak rice of Siddharthanagar have got the much-needed impetus and a global platform under this ODOP scheme,” he said.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh realty sector hit hard as NRIs fly to greener pastures||VIJAYAWADA: For long, it was the non-resident Indians (NRIs) who boosted the demand in the realty sector in Andhra Pradesh. But for the first time in decades, the trend is on the decline with many NRIs shying away, say realtors, adding that Hyderabad has now become their favoured investment destination. Andhra Pradesh is among the country’s top five states in number of people settled abroad. Many invested in properties, both residential and commercial, in their home state. As land is a scarce resource in many urban pockets in AP, unlike in neighbouring Telangana, the demand used to be high. “Till two-three years back, a good real estate venture used to get NRI investments in the range of 40-50%. The demand from NRIs drove the market for decades in this part of the region, especially in Vijayawada, Guntur and Visakhapatnam. But now investments hardly exceed 20%,” Tummala Vamshi Krishna, general secretary (Vijayawada chapter) of Builders’ Association of India, told TOI. AP received Rs 19,320 crore in terms of foreign remittance in 2018 and a major portion was invested in the real estate sector. P Sunil, a Vijayawada-based builder, added that they used to sell many properties citing NRI investments. “It was used as the USP (unique selling proposition) of many projects. NRIs were not only just demand boosters, they also acted as market triggers. They added some glamour factor to our business and helped us maintain the market momentum. But now, as they are turning away from the state, they are also pulling down the demand,” he rued. Vamshi Krishna admitted that NRI investments have dropped in recent times due to uncertainty over capital. “The value of properties on which they have already invested has come down by nearly 50-60%. So, they are heading towards Hyderabad where the realty market is attractive and wealth is getting compounded faster,” he observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-realty-sector-hit-hard-as-nris-fly-to-greener-pastures/articleshow/81940886.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Nagpur||Gondia has no vaccination stock, five dists have for 1-2 days only||NAGPUR: Even though the Centre has been repeatedly saying there is no shortage of doses, the Covid-19 vaccination programme is set to grind to a halt in Gondia district on Wednesday as it has no stock remaining after Tuesday’s programme. Akola, Yavatmal, Buldhana and Washim — all in Amravati Division, along with Nagpur Rural and city’s Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) have enough stock to last only one more day. They will stop vaccinating recipients from Thursday. A state official said Centre is not replenishing stock continuously. Officials from Gondia district told TOI that the district had to reduce the number of centres from 104 to 80 on Monday due to shortage of doses. “On Tuesday, we operated only 10 centres and managed to vaccinate 1,318 as against more than 4,000 on the previous two days,” they said. Gondia has been using Covishield since January 16 when the vaccination programme started. Officials of Amravati division said the four districts has neither Covishield nor Covaxin in the store rooms. “Whatever stock is remaining is at the vaccination centres. Instructions have been given to all districts to stop vaccination at primary health centres (PHCs) in villages and continue only at district general hospitals and rural hospitals on Wednesday. If no fresh stock is received by Thursday, no one will get vaccinated. Amravati district has doses for two more days,” they said. Similarly, the Nagpur zilla parishad store room was emptied on April 4. The ZP vaccinates people in rural areas in 188 centres. Nearly 25,000 were being vaccinated every day in the rural. On Tuesday, 23,614 were vaccinated. As on Tuesday, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), which runs the programme in city, has 22,000 doses of Covishield in its store room and some more doses at the centres. Out of these, NMC gave the zilla parishad 20,000 so that the programme continues uninterrupted on Wednesday. The civic body inoculated 9,794 on April 5 and 15,990 on April 6. The NMC, however, is facing shortage of Covaxin doses, which is administered in six centres, since the last four days. As a result, four are dispensing Covishield while the programme has stopped at the other two. Officials from GMCH said the 550 doses of remaining Covaxin at the GMCH will last till Thursday. In case this centre is also converted into Covishield, the second dose of healthcare workers (HCW), frontline workers (FLW) and people from age-appropriate group will be effected. Guardian minister Nitin Raut and divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar had upped the vaccination target to 40,000 per day which is likely to take a hit if the district does not receive fresh stock. State immunisation officer DN Patil said all the stock given by the Centre to all districts according to the number of active cases have been distributed. “Today, I do not have any stock. Some districts have already raised alerts regarding the vaccination programme saying that they have stock for just one or two days. The Centre needs to continuously replenish the stock as we have scaled up our vaccination programme across the state. We are touching over 4 lakh now daily. Last week, we had received 26.77 lakh Covishield doses and 3.45 lakh Covaxin doses, which were distributed across the state,” he said. State health minister Rajesh Tope on Tuesday has raised the issue of shortage of doses with Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan in a meeting. After Maharashta demanded more doses, Union minister for information and broadcasting Prakash Javadekar, on March 26, had slammed the MVA government citing 56% doses were remaining unused and suggested that the state must escalate the vaccination programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gondia-has-no-vax-stock-five-dists-have-for-1-2-days-only/articleshow/81939225.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Jiya’s lawyer Mahesh Gupta told the court that Papala came to Kolhapur in 2020 and Jiya had no role in the gangster’s escape from jail in Alwar. He said chargesheet in the case has been filed and only allegations of helping the co accused to make fake Aadhaar card and giving shelter to the gangster is being made against her .

Papla escaped from police custody in September 2019 and was arrested by the special emergency team from Kolhapur on January 28, 2021. Thereafter, he has been dodging the police and had a narrow escape with them several times.

Referring to their telephonic talk, Kamal Nath said that the Coronavirus situation in the state is grim and suggested steps to bring the situation under control. He said that the vaccination drive must be intensified further, the ceiling of age should be done away with and everyone should be vaccinated against Coronavirus free of cost. Areas with greater infection in the first Coronavirus wave and the current one should be identified and vaccination of residents in those areas should be carried out on priority. Availability of vaccines in excess and their safe storage would help in speeding up the vaccination process, he added. The former chief minister further said that health workers should reach out to people and bring them to vaccination centres. There should be a door-to-door free rapid antigen test drive so that infected persons could be identified and isolated. Tracing work should also be carried out promptly. Rates of Coronavirus testing in private hospitals should be kept at the minimum and implemented strictly. Free treatment of Coronavirus patients must also be ensured. Since, ICU, HDU and Oxygen beds in hospitals are almost full, necessary arrangements should be made to have more beds or else the situation may get out of control. Urgent steps should be taken to ensure easy availability of Oxygen for Coronavirus patients. Closed Oxygen plants should be opened so that smooth Oxygen supply to hospitals is maintained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/nath-writes-to-chouhan-to-intensify-vac-drive/articleshow/81938281.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||India loses hair business jobs to cheap child labour in Myanmar||HYDERABAD: Human hair exporters from India have stumbled upon videos of children engaged in hair processing in Myanmar because of which at least two lakh employees working in the raw hair processing industry have reportedly lost employment in cities such as Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Chennai and Eluru, all thanks to Chinese nationals smuggling human hair to Myanmar. This has been corroborated by Kolkata customs office in an alert note sent recently to all zones, including Hyderabad. Industry sources said that the figures could be much higher and added that around eight lakh workers have lost employment because of the human hair smuggling racket. Customs sleuths alleged that the children were being engaged in hair processing in Myanmar in violation of child labour norms. The racket came out in the open when Kolkata customs officials raided the office of a human hair trader recently. The customs officials found that one exporter and a customs clearance agent were in cahoots and the human hair consignments cumulatively valued at Rs 9.4 crore. The Chinese importers were resorting to illegal trade by under-invoicng hair to evade import duty in Myanmar and China. In the note, the office of the principal commissioner of Kolkata’s customs said: “Smugglers are engaged in the illegal trade of Indian-origin raw human hair to China via land routes. The smuggling via land is to escape 28% Chinese import duty while paying a pittance to Myanmarese children engaged in segregating and isolating hair strains from raw and unprocessed human hair. This has resulted in loss of employment in the domestic industry.” Benjamin Cherian, president of Human Hair and Hair Products Manufacturers Exporters Association, in a letter to the Union ministry of commerce and industry, said their industry will rebound thanks to the nationwide crackdown on smuggling of human hair across Myanmar and Bangladesh borders. He said by exporting human hair, particularly goli variety (thutthi and choti are other varieties), it would not only earn foreign exchange but also provided employment to a large number of workers. “As per the industry estimates, 50,000-70,000 people out of 8.61 lakh workers are back at work to process hair,” said a hair exporter. India is a major collector and supplier of human hair accounting for almost 90% of the global supply in the $9 billion industry and growing at 32% compound annual growth rate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/india-loses-hair-biz-jobs-to-cheap-child-labour-in-myanmar/articleshow/81940889.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Lucknow||TMC’s ‘backroom boys’ to counter BJP star campaigners||LUCKNOW: The Trinamool Congress (TMC) has brought on board its ‘backroom boys’ to counter the Bharatiya Janata Party’s star campaigners in the fierce and interesting West Bengal poll battle. TMC members in BJP-ruled states have been asked to analyse the ruling party’s performance in that state and send a report to their parent party in West Bengal, to be then shared with the voters. TMC state president in UP, Neeraj Rai said, “We focus on information regarding the state’s law and order, economic performance and how safe it is for women. There are enough media reports and videos that we get from different sources to support the information that we share. It presents to the people the real picture of governance in BJP-ruled states.” Considering that UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, being a Hindutva icon, is one of the biggest crowd-pullers for BJP, the performance of his government in his home state could be of much interest to Bengal voters. The issues that had put the Yogi governent in a tight spot in the last four years have become talking points for TMC in social and other media campaigns and debates, he said. “Before corona, Bengal’s GDP was higher than that of UP. Also, as per NCRB data, Bengal has seen a drop in crime rate, but UP has seen a rise. There is a need to tell voters about this,” said Rai. West Bengal has significant presence of Hindi-speaking voters, those who migrated from their native states to Bengal in search of work, mainly in the small scale industry sector. Most of these voters are from UP’s eastern districts, Jharkhand, Bihar and Punjab. The last four phases of Bengal assembly elections, on April 17, April 22, April 26 and April 29, will have 52 seats out of 294 assembly seats, from Asansol till Bardhaman, with a dominant presence of Hindi-speaking voters. “We, from UP, and TMC members from other states will go to Bengal after April 10 to directly reach out to non-Bengali voters,” said Rai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/tmcs-backroom-boys-to-counter-bjp-star-campaigners/articleshow/81940888.cms||Neha Shukla

Addressing a press conference at state Congress headquarters, party’s state media in-charge Jitu Patwari said Chouhan had regularly been reviewing coronavirus situation in the state over the past one year but it has gone from bad to worse. The CM has also been carrying out campaigns to control the pandemic but to no avail, he said. Patwari further said that even as people of the Madhya Pradesh are reeling under the second wave of coronavirus pandemic, private hospitals are ‘looting’ them in the name of treatment. Families of coronavirus patients are arranging money to pay for treatment of their kin by mortgaging and selling their properties. In the government hospitals, beds are full and patients have to wait for 48 to 72 hours to get admitted. Patwari also raised questions on the logic of circulars issued by the state government to stop registration of health and frontline workers for vaccination The former minister also said that age limit for vaccination must be done away with and everyone should be vaccinated. Referring to the CM’s awareness campaign in front of the Gandhi statue at Minto Hall, Patwari said he was doing it to highlight the foundation day of BJP in the media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/shivraj-indulging-in-photo-op-over-covid-crisis-alleges-cong/articleshow/81938290.cms||---

He first visited Dhule on Tuesday and held a meeting with the district officials. The then traveled to Malegaon in Nashik district, where he inspected the Malegaon civil hospital and discussed Covid-related issues with the Malegaon Municipal Corporation officials and representatives of some private hospitals. Malegaon (Central) MLA Mufti Mohammad Ismail was also present. Dhule Covid-19 coordinator and RMO of the civil hospital Vishal Patil told TOI that the health minister has given a slew of instructions to the district administration on the Covid front. “Tope has directed the officials to set up four more liquid oxygen tanks in the district — preferably in rural Dhule. We currently have one liquid oxygen tank at the government medical college and hospital,” said Patil. Patil added that Tope has directed the local administration to step up daily testing and contact tracing. Similarly, all efforts must be made to ramp up the vaccination of beneficiaries aged above 45 years. “Our daily Covid testing number is around 3,500, but the minister wants it to go up to 5,000. Moreover, the contact tracing per Covid positive patient should be increased to 30, instead of 20. Tope also stressed on the need for the administration to target vaccination of at least 10,000 people a day — up from 5,000 a day now,” he said. Tope has instructed that the 25 ventilators available with different government hospitals in the district be put to use. Similarly, the local FDA officials must see to it there is no shortage of remdesivir. During his visit to the Malegaon civil hospital, some officials from private hospitals raised the oxygen availability issue. Mufti Mohammad Ismail also told Tope that at times, some private hospitals face shortage of medical oxygen, which can be fatal for Covid-19 patients. “Tope spoke with the top authorities of the Nashik district and instructed them to establish a liquid oxygen tank at the Malegaon civil hospital that would cater to the needs of the hospitals in Malegaon,” said the Malegaon Municipal Corporation deputy commissioner Vaibhav Londe. He added that Tope has directed the civic body to increase centres for vaccination and give permission to private hospitals with cold chain systems to start vaccinating.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/tope-visits-dhule-malegaon-gives-slew-of-instructions/articleshow/81938313.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

The 12-year-old victim told the commission officials that the director of Jeevan Jyoti children home made older boys sexually abuse him and his medical report confirmed the assault. Orders have been issued to cancel the recognition of the shelter. A case of sexual assault has been registered at Mathura Gate police station in Bharatpur by the officials of a child welfare department after it was found that a 12-year-old boy, who had been residing there for the past two-and-a half months, was allegedly sodomised. Rajasthan Commission for Protection of Child Rights chairperson Sangeeta Beniwal said, “Initially in the FIR, the accused was not named, but I got that changed as the director of the shelter is the one who sexually assaulted the victim. The boy said he would be taken from his room at night and sometimes when he was going for bath. He gave details about the abuse and even the medical report confirmed the rape.” While the officials were talking to the boys, who have now been shifted to other centres, a 10-year-old boy also told them that the he had been picked up while he was begging in Mathura following which he was brought to Jeevan Jyoti where he was also abused by the accused. His medical examination will be done as well. Officials feel that more boys will gradually come forward who had been sexually exploited by the accused. The boys residing at the shelter were there due to multiple reasons though none of them have any criminal background.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rights-body-finds-1-more-boy-abused-in-shelter-home/articleshow/81939293.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Village folk taught me a lesson in self-restraint, discipline||By Dhananjay Singh I come from a village in eastern Uttar Pradesh, bordering Bihar. Though I live in Hyderabad now, members of my extended family still stay in the village where many people are employed in labour intensive industries across metro cities like Delhi, Gurgaon, Mumbai, Kolkata, Surat, and Ahmedabad. Several of them had marched back to the confines of their homes and family in the village, when lockdown norms were enforced in cities last year and the lack of family safety net and social support, coupled with misinformation and large-scale circulation of fake messages created panic among them. I dreaded the thought of some of my village folks acting as asymptomatic carriers of the virus and acting as ‘super spreaders’ out of their sheer ignorance. I feared the worst, on account of the abysmal public health infrastructure in my village. But today, I take pride in sharing the restrain and self-regulation exercised by my village folks and excellent initiatives adopted in fighting the coronavirus. Anticipating the migration of people back to their village, the village elders, in discussion with the panchayat members, panchayat secretary, and primary health workers converted the village school and anganwadis into quarantine centres. These centres were very well managed with government support and villagers volunteering and contributing food items, local immunity boosters and other essentials. The sarpanch coordinated with the district health officials in getting some oxygen cylinders at the primary health centre for emergencies that helped in saving at least five lives. The village came together to prepare quarantine norms for any villager coming from outside. Temporary barriers were erected and guarded at all the entry points to restrict the movement of strangers. Public address systems at the temples were used to disperse information about the importance of social distancing, wearing of masks and regular washing of hands. The best part was that village folks exercised self-regulation and complied with the Covid norms. The well spread-out physical settlements in villages and spacious home designs also played a major role in fighting the virus. We did have some positive cases but our collective effort and collective will, worked as a shield against Covid-19. I have often seen educated urban folks mocking village folk and their rustic practises. But through the pandemic I realised that while the smart, educated urban folks were innovating ways to bypass Covid norms and endanger others’ life, people in villages – like mine -- innovated a successful self-regulated, self-governed model to fight Coronavirus.

It on Tuesday revised the SOP for handling international passengers arriving from UK, Brazil, Europe, South Africa and Middle East.BMC rules state that passengers from those countries are quarantined in hotels for seven days, and allowed to leave only after they test negative for Covid-19. But recently there have been cases of passengers going missing from hotels. BMC made it mandatory for its officials to visit hotels twice during the stay of a passenger, followed by maintaining a weekly report of the visits.

---||India||Covid-19: Cluster infections key to 2nd wave of the pandemic||MUMBAI: Cluster infections appear to be playing a significant role in the second wave of the pandemic. City doctors say rapid spread of the infection in much bigger groups and failure to prevent entire families from getting infected despite isolating index cases are emerging as key factors in the ongoing transmission. Some of the major hospitals in Mumbai bear testimony to that. In the past three weeks, the Nesco jumbo hospital in Goregaon has treated three big clusters. The first group was of 49 construction workers from a Metro site. The second group was that of 13 labourers who picked up the infection while carrying out renovation work at an apartment in Mahalaxmi. It emerged that a family member from the household was carrying symptoms, said Nesco dean Dr Neelam Andrade. The third major cluster was a family of 16 members that had picked up the infection following a wedding celebration. Weddings and social gatherings have been the source of infections in most big clusters, said Dr Deepa Shriyan, dean of Dahisar jumbo facility. Civic officials have made another vital observation. Previously, taking away the index case from a household could prevent the spread of infection among other family members to a great extent. That no longer seems to be happening, said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner. “We have seen that with one of our own staffers. We hospitalised her as soon as she tested positive, but her husband tested positive after five days. Their daughter tested positive three days after the father,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-cluster-infections-key-to-2nd-wave-of-the-pandemic/articleshow/81942162.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Lucknow||AAP moves SEC, questions clamping of prohibitory order||Lucknow: Aam Aadmi Party has approached the UP state election commission demanding that it take cognisance of the imposition of Section 144 in the state which prohibits more than five people collecting at any place. This order, implemented by the government in light of rising Covid-19 cases, would severely hamper the Opposition campaign for the Panchayat elections which are due to be held from April 15. AAP MP Sanjay Singh questioned the motive of the government behind the order, asking whether there was no Covid-19 in states like Kerala, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Assam, where BJP leaders, including state chief minister Yogi Adityanath, have been going to campaign for ongoing assembly polls. “Under Section 144 not more than five people are allowed to gather anywhere. If we were to hold a booth committee meeting, there would be at least 100-200 members. If there is a village meeting, there would be a minimum of 50 people. If not more than five people are permitted, then why are you having elections? While the BJP will not be affected, Opposition parties will be harassed,” Singh said. He also said that candidates will get symbols on April 11 and they will effectively get just four to five days for campaigning. “On top of that”, he added, “we cannot have more than five people at any point. Is this an election or a joke? It is not corona but the fear of losing which has made BJP take these steps. Yogi Adityanath is himself campaigning in Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu and claiming that thousands are coming to hear him in gatherings where not a single Covid protocol is being followed. Why is this action then being taken only in UP?” On Tuesday, the party released a list of 448 candidates for the four phase panchayat polls. Out of these, two are sitting block development council members, 14 sitting pradhans, 29 zila panchayat members, one doctor, six former BDC members, for former pradhans, one former zila panchayat member, 49 farmers, 25 women and 30 social workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/aap-moves-sec-questions-clamping-of-prohibitory-order/articleshow/81940896.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Bail to riot accused in 2 separate cases||NEW DELHI: A court has granted bail to an accused in two separate cases related to Delhi riots. The court found no CCTV footage or video clip linking him to the incident in one case while his identification by policemen was found questionable in the other. It also came on record that in one case, the gunshot victim hadn’t specifically named the accused in his complaint. In the case of the gunshot victim, Shah Alam’s counsel Dinesh Tiwari argued that his client had been languishing in jail since April 30, 2020. He stressed that there was no electronic evidence available on record. Tiwari emphasised that the statements of the victim and other public witnesses recorded with the police were all “undated”. He also questioned Alam’s identification by two police constables. Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav noted that it was “beyond comprehension” that when the two police witnesses had categorically seen and identified Alam taking part in riots, what stopped them from reporting the matter then and there in the police station or reporting it to higher police officers. The other case too pertained to a gunshot wound suffered by a victim of the riots. In this case, the prosecution had relied on the identification of the victim and two policemen. The defense counsel, however, pointed out that there was a huge delay between the incident and the recording of the victim’s statement before the police. “I find substance in the submissions of learned counsel for the applicant that the statement of said injured is highly belated, without any cogent/plausible explanation accorded by the investigating agency for such a humongous delay,” the court stated. Further, the court highlighted that Alam’s role was on a similar footing as another accused person to whom the Delhi high court had granted bail on October 13, 2020. “Investigation in the matter is complete and a chargesheet has already been filed. Trial is likely to take a long time; applicant cannot be made to incarcerate in jail for infinity merely on account of the fact that other persons who were part of the riotous mob have to be identified and arrested,” the order stated. The prosecution in these two cases argued that several persons who were a part of the “riotous mob” had to be identified and arrested. Police also had to unearth the “conspiracy angle” behind such large-scale violence and there was every chance of Alam threatening or injuring public witnesses, all residents of the same locality, if released on bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bail-to-riot-accused-in-2-separate-cases/articleshow/81939340.cms||Aamir Khan
---||Hyderabad||HC to Telangana: Increase RT-PCR tests to check Covid spread||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Tuesday expressed displeasure at the state government for doing fewer RT-PCR tests at a time when the second wave of Covid-19 is sweeping across the country. The judges were particularly upset at the measures taken to tackle the pandemic in Rangareddy, Warangal and Karimnagar districts. “Your testing is pathetic in these three districts. Out of the nine lakh Covid-19 tests conducted so far, only one lakh of them are RT-PCR tests. The rest are rapid antigen tests (RATs). You have to increase the RT-PCR tests to tackle the pandemic effectively,” a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy said. The judges sought answers within 48 hours from the government as to why it was doing more number of rapid antigen tests but reduced the RT-PCR tests to a mere 10% of total tests despite knowing fully well that RT-PCR testing had helped the state in containing the spread of Covid-19. “Why are you trying to bluff everyone by showing a high number of tests when 90% are useless antigen tests, while only 10% are RT-PCR,” the CJ said. The case will come up for hearing on Thursday.Resuming the hearing in cases related to Covid-19 treatment and containment, the judges said they were not convinced with the contents of a report filed by the public health director. Addressing advocate general BS Prasad, the judges said the government and the official machinery should think out of the box for taking the vaccine to the people instead of asking them to come to hospitals. “People have various fears and you have to clear them by going to them. Take the vaccine to the street points and ensure they are given 24X7. Send across a message that ample vaccine is available and ensure that all people get the vaccine to make our state safer,” the bench said. The judges raised concerns on crowding at function halls, theatres, bars, restaurants, pubs, processions, marriages, funerals, etc., and sought to know from the authorities on the steps being taken to reduce congregation of people at these places. “Occupancy in theatres, pubs and restaurants has to be reduced. Restore the isolation and quarantine centres and ensure vaccination for people at old age homes,” the bench said. The judges wanted information on the number of beds with oxygen and ventilators in the state — both private and government hospitals. “All the 54 Covid-19 designated government hospitals must remain as designated hospitals,” the bench said in response to a suggestion from Prabhakar Chikkudu, counsel for one of the petitioners. The judges further said, “Also tell us about the fines being collected from violators of social distancing norms and for not wearing masks district-wise.” They also wanted the government to inform the court on the steps taken to contain the virus at construction sites, railway stations, airports and roads and junctions on the state borders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-to-state-increase-rt-pcr-tests-to-check-covid-spread/articleshow/81940902.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Meerut||UP seizes over 5 lakh litres of booze ahead of rural polls, more given out for free||MEERUT: Savouring a plate of charcoal-grilled chicken drenched in green chutney, Ghanshyam surreptitiously pocketed a bottle of liquor handed over by an influential man of his village. The last few days had been good for Ghanshyam. He has stashed a good amount of liquor bottles at his home which he believes will last another six months. A government report says that a third of Indian men drink alcohol. And for tipplers of Uttar Pradesh, panchayat polls mean free booze. According to an estimate by UP Police, over 5.5lakh litres of illicit liquor was seized in March alone. Panchayat elections in UP will be held in four phases between April 15 and 29. The period leading to rural polls also sees a spurt in deaths due to consumption of spurious liquor which is distributed free by the contestants. Data provided by the office of the state’s additional director general of police (ADG), law and order, Prashant Kumar reveals that 43 people died due to consumption of toxic liquor across the state between January 1 and March 31 this year. “Each village has close to six pradhan candidates. Votes are also cast simultaneously for block development council member, gram panchayat member and for the district panchayat member. So there are almost 15 to 20 candidates in each village. And they all try to woo every voter. So liquor and food is offered for free,” said Jitender Huda, a Shamli based farmer. Ravinder Singh of Nagla village in Muzaffarnagar said, “Liquor is the most attractive option. Since margin of victory is quite thin in village polls, candidates try everything from offering sumptuous lunches to distributing liquor pouches.” With liquor flowing freely, youngsters too want to give it a try. “A new breed of addicts gets ready in every village during panchayat polls,” Huda said. Violence is also an integral part of village polls in western UP. Ajay Malik, a villager in Bijnor, said, “During election season the village is always on the edge. Addicts enjoying the free supply of liquor indulge in group fights. But their allegiance is also fleeting. They side with whoever gives them more liquor and money.” ADG Kumar said,“Police is always on toes to curb distribution of liquor in villages, particularly when panchayat polls are round the corner. Cops accompanied by excise officials are regularly destroying raw alcohol making units and arresting the suspects. State borders are also on our radar and police are seizing large consignments as well. In fact we had started strengthening our information network well in advance and any tip-off is taken seriously and culprits dealt with iron hand.” Instances of domestic violence also see a jump during the period. In Bijrol village of Baghpat, women held a protest against the distribution of liquor last week. Rekha Arya, a resident of the village, said, “We faced tough resistance from some people when we decided not to vote for any candidate who supplies liquor to attract voters. So much free liquor has its consequences. During elections there is a sudden spike in domestic violence. And children also get free access to it, and it destroys the family.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-seizes-over-5-lakh-litres-of-booze-ahead-of-rural-polls-more-given-out-for-free/articleshow/81937565.cms||Sandeep Rai

KWLS has already reported damage to 500 trees due to ravaging fires and divisional forest officer (DFO) Amit Kanwar has ordered a probe in the matter. The investigation was conducted by regional officer Aarti Maithani, who found out through the villagers that Manglu Lal, a resident of Roopa village, in a bid to protect his animals from flies had lit fire in the animal shelter house. The smoke reached the nearby fields and to the Kilondi civil forest where around 2.50 ha afforestation under CAMPA was done. It took almost four years for the department to nurture those trees which suffered major loss. DFO Kanwar said, “Manglu Lal has been booked under the Indian Forest Act, 1927 for causing damage to the forests and ecosystem. Notably, it is the duty of every citizen of the country to protect and improve the natural environment and have compassion for all living creatures under section 51 A (G) of the Constitution. Anyone found causing damage to it will not be spared.” Meanwhile, four villagers — three women and one man — in Narainbagar forest range sustained burn injuries while trying to douse a fire in their farms. Badrinath DFO Ashutosh Singh, said,“Rameshwari Devi suffered 20% burns on fingers while the other three are doing fine. They had lit fire in their own farms and were trapped while dousing it.” On Tuesday, the forest department reported 75 forest fires — 35 in Garhwal, 37 in Kumaon and 3 in wildlife administration — which gutted 105.55 ha of forests resulting in a loss of Rs 2,21,660.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-forest-dept-files-first-case-under-forest-act/articleshow/81937567.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Hyderabad||Blended learning: The new normal for higher education||By B V R Mohan Reddy Covid-19 is the ‘black swan’ event of the 21st century. More than a year into its occurrence, it continues to wreak havoc, disrupting lives and livelihoods and impacting several economic sectors. The pandemic disturbed education and learning equally, though not talked about extensively. Digital technologies, which made considerable progress in the past decade, saw accelerated adoption during the pandemic in several sectors impacting consumers, businesses, and governments to ensure business continuity. Digital became a quick fix to the shocking developments that paralysed lives. It became the de facto medium in education too. Digital education got a big boost. Institutions and teachers reached out to students with digital content synchronously and asynchronously and enabled their continued learning during the challenging circumstances that prevailed through most of 2020. The situation continues well into 2021. This medium facilitated reaching out to students in remotest locations, gave students the flexibility to pick programmes and pace their learning to suit their circumstances. However, the evolving online modality faces several challenges in terms of connectivity, device availability, privacy, content, and pedagogy, limiting the reach and effectiveness of education. Softer aspects such as student socialisation, communication, collaboration, camaraderie, peer-learning, which are natural human instincts, have taken a back seat. Besides, the online medium cannot support labs, experimentation, tactile learning, and emotional exchange. Unlike popular conception, online education is not about broadcasting to students using audio/video communication technologies. That is distance education, which is unidirectional with no student participation. Online education is not about hours of teacher monologuing followed by student assignments and tests. In the new education universe, the student is at the centre. So, the new format has to take the transformation of the student mindset into account. Generation Z, or colloquially known as Zoomers in the west, are distinctly different from the previous generations of students. This set of students are digital natives, born and brought up in the Internet era. They owe their unique identity to rapid technology adoption in all walks of life. Social media and digital communication tools are part of their daily routine. An online student is attracted/distracted by social media constantly. Getting them to disassociate from digital disturbances and grabbing their undivided attention toward the class lecture is not easy. To effectively engage Generation Z during online sessions, the content must be modular, the pedagogy be refreshed, and the evaluation systems more robust. We need to experiment with new methods such as "flip learning", where classwork becomes homework and homework becomes classwork. Educational institutions must replace face-to-face, long teacher monologues with modularised audio-video capsules of 10-12 minutes (Generation Z’s typical attention spans). Further, they need to reinforce the learning with follow-up quizzes, group activities, breakout room discussions, and problem-solving exercises before delivering the next module. In this format, students get to read, watch or listen in a non-classroom environment, actively participate, and reinforce the learning during the classroom session. Students learn the theory by themselves ahead of the session and then practise together during the class. The content for reading and listening is in asynchronous mode and so students can pace themselves based on their uptake and schedule the sessions based on their convenience. This would truly make learning an ‘anytime and from anywhere’ activity. Unlike synchronous online learning, high bandwidth requirements and scheduling conflicts are less serious concerns in asynchronous learning. However, pre-planned fewer student presence in classrooms addresses some of the limitations of pure online learning. There is no single way to address this challenge. Teachers will have to find innovative ways to engage students based on the subject, student behaviour, and available infrastructure. Teachers also need to constantly look at the feedback from asynchronous learning to suitably modify the synchronous content. One solution will not fit all. Through this process of customised ‘blended’ in-class learning and harnessing the strengths of synchronous and asynchronous learning, we can achieve better learning outcomes. More importantly, while being cost-effective, blended learning offers greater flexibility to students allowing them to pursue other interests outside traditional learning. Blended learning is more equitable, inclusive of students with physical and learning disabilities while keeping classroom connections and the social dimension of education alive. While these modalities evolve, we can certainly say that the pandemic accelerated online education deployment. As vaccination progresses, hope is on the horizon for students to return to their campuses. When they get back, will it be back to old ways, or will we do ‘online’ only? The answer lies somewhere in between, and I am certain ‘blended’ is the way forward.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Private hospitals to set up vax centres at gated complexes, corp offices||KOLKATA: Private hospitals in Kolkata have started approaching corporates and housing complexes to set up ‘off-site’ vaccination centres at these places to inoculate professionals and residents. The move follows a prod from Swasthya Bhavan, which asked hospitals to take proactive measures to step up the number of vaccinations. At least three private hospitals on Tuesday lined up more than a dozen corporates and complexes who have agreed to join the initiative. The off-site centres will start functioning once a formal directive is issued by the government within the next 2-3 days. AMRI Hospitals have lined up 12 corporate offices and 10 residential complexes where vaccines will be given by its three units. The centres chosen are located in the catchment area of its units at Mukundapur, Salt Lake and Dhakuria. Corporates and complexes have been asked to identify three areas for the camps — one each for the pre-vaccination waiting lounge, the inoculation room and the post-vaccination observation area. Hospitals are gearing up to use an ambulance for the job and will employ a doctor and a nurse apart from vaccinators. There are still some concerns about AEFI (adverse event following immunization) and what is to be done in case a recipient needs medical attention. “We need specific instructions and guidelines from the health department on this. But since we have been vaccinating for the last three months, we have an idea of what needs to be done for AEFI at an off-site centre. We are getting ready with our plans and preparations accordingly,” said AMRI Hospitals CEO Rupak Barua. While, RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences(RTIICS) has firmed up a plan to set up inoculation sites at three housing complexes and four corporate offices, Medica Superspecialty Hospital said it was ready to take the initiative at a short notice. “We can launch the centres within 24 hours of receiving a directive,” said chairperson Alok Roy. “This will make a difference to the working population. We had expected a rush when vaccination was opened up for them on April 1. But response has been slow. Off-site centres will get more from the group quickly inoculated,” added Barua.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pvt-hosps-to-set-up-vax-centres-at-gated-complexes-corp-offices/articleshow/81938363.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

At least two others are wanted, including a female ‘bank employee’ who called up the accountant. In July 2020, the accountant got calls from ‘bank employee’ Priya Sharma, offering a Rs 12 lakh personal loan. When he gave in, Sharma asked for Rs 12,600 to be paid for instant loan approval. The accountant did so but her demands escalated. He went to Delhi to verify the identity of the account-holder to whom he had been making transfers totally Rs 2.8 lakh. On finding no such individual existed, he lodged a complaint with police. Police said the money was transferred to Manish Sharma, a carpenter.

---||Nagpur||Testing up, centres down, labs overloaded, results pending for days||NAGPUR: At 2.30pm, R Sahu (36) restlessly waits in the queue at Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC)'s Hazaripahad Covid testing centre. This is Sahu's fourth visit to collect the RT-PCR report of his sister, who is ailing since April 1. A Kattewar, in his 50s, a sales professional, two cops and some nearby residents are also among those repeatedly visiting the centre for the last couple of days. The queue is even longer around 6km away at Raj Nagar PWD quarters, where a testing centre is run by NMC. Ulhas P (55), a government employee, is unable to get his report since April 2. Farther away in a different NMC zone, RT-PCR test results are pending and citizens returning empty-handed from their last two visits to the Lashkaribagh centre. At Pachpaoli Police quarters, where a Dedicated Covid Health Centre (DCHC), a Covid Care Centre (CCC) and a testing centre are running simultaneously, the situation is better as citizens get results the next day. This is because the centre doesn't take more samples than its limit of 400 Viral Transport Medium (VTM) tubes per day. As compared to Pachpaoli, far fewer samples are being collected elsewhere but the overall number is still double of the highest sample collection done in the first Covid wave. The district reached a high of 18,135 tests on April 3 with bulk of the load taken by antigen kits and private labs. Officials wondered as the rush is from walk-ins of people coming on their own. Same-day results are possible only for the rapid antigen test (RAT), which takes 30 minutes. But even to get these reports at NMC centres, citizens are having to wait for 6 hours. Though unprecedented rush is being seen, NMC has cut down manpower and number of testing centres to 43 as it got entrusted with the burgeoning Covid vaccination drive. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI that NMC still has 53 collection points. “12 mobile vans — one in each zone and two at Civil Lines office — too are deployed for swab collection,” he said. The vans are set up at housing societies or crowded areas where large number of cases are surfacing. Yet, NMC had to shut down 3 centres to divert the manpower elsewhere. Joshi said the civic chief Radhakrishnan B held a meeting with all the 6 public labs to address the issue of samples piling up and pending results. “NMC has given 1 PCR machine each to IGGMCH and Nagpur University labs to expedite the process. Except in GMCH, two data entry operators are also allotted to the labs. Hopefully, the measures will help attain delivery of results in 24 hours within a day or two,” Joshi said. Citizens testing positive will also not need to visit the centre as NMC is likely to start SMS alerts, Joshi added. “An SMS in the name of the patient will be sent, informing about the Covid-positive report and other guidelines. But if someone needs a hard copy, they will have to get it collected from the centre,” he said. Manifold increase in workload has also been reported at private labs. Clinicare director Dr Rajkumar Rathi said they had drastically cut home collection of swabs because hospital collection is more important. “We are giving home service only in emergency cases now. The workload is huge, so reporting is delayed. Earlier, we gave result in 4 hours but now it has stretched to 12 hours,” he said. Crescent lab director Dr Sarfaraz Ahmed said mostly symptomatic patients are getting tests done, and that the lab was receiving around 800 samples a day.

The average wholesale onion price was recorded at Rs 750 per quintal on Tuesday at Lasalgaon. According to the APMC officials, an increase in supply has led to a drop in the average wholesale onion prices. “The arrivals of onions have increased up to 30,000 quintals a day at Lasalgaon, but the demand is comparatively low. The supply has increased in all onion-growing states in the country that has reduced the demand for Nashik’s onions,” said APMC officials. “Apart from the domestic market, the export is also not satisfactory. The demand is also low at that front,” added APMC officials. A record 32,100 quintals of onions were auctioned at Lasalgaon APMC on Tuesday. The auction was the highest auction reported this season. The minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices were recorded at Rs 700 and Rs 1,136 per quintal,respectively, on Tuesday at Lasalgaon. Presently, onions arriving in the market are of both fresh late kharif and summer onions. Both summer and late kharif onions are getting almost the same price. Of 32,100 quintals auctioned on Tuesday, 30,000 quintals were kharif onions and remaining 2,100 quintals were summer onions. The arrival of summer onions is expected to increase further during next fortnight. According to traders, the trend of the average wholesale onion prices will be downward and it will be in the price range between Rs 700 and Rs 850 per quintal for next fortnight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/avg-wholesale-onion-price-drops-below-rs-800-per-quintal/articleshow/81938371.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Kolkata||Halls turn into labs, multiple batches for ISC practicals||Kolkata: In some city schools large halls have been converted into makeshift laboratories, in some others all the labs are being converted to conduct practical exams of the subject in question, whereas in some others multiple batches are being created for examinees. All these efforts aim at better distancing of examinees as they are back in school for the ISC laboratory practical examinations. As Covid cases are on the rise, schools are extremely worried about the safety of the children and have fine- tuned measures under the guidance of convenors and external examiners. St Augustine’s Day School, Kolkata, has converted a large hall into a makeshift laboratory once for physics and then again for biology. This will ensure enough distancing among children, the school administration said. For chemistry practical exams, multiple small batches have been created since these cannot be held in the big hall because of gas connections requirement, said Richard Gasper, head of the school. ISC biology practical exams happened at La Martiniere for Girls and chemistry happened at South City International School on Tuesday. “We have acquired enough equipments so that there is no repeat use for any child. Each child gets a new set,” said principal of LMG, Rupkatha Sarkar. At St James School, where the practical exams begin on Wednesday, all laboratories have been converted for physics on the first day and this will get repeated for the other two subjects too. “That way we are reducing the number of batches and yet maintain distancing. We are making additional gas connections for the chemistry practicals in all the labs,” said principal T H Ireland. Heritage School has revised its earlier plan and now, instead of two batches, the class has been divided into four batches with 15 students each and lab practicals will happen over eight days, said principal Seema Sapru.

---||Lucknow||UP’s Mar revenue collection Rs 3,030cr more than last yr’s||Lucknow: The revenue receipts of the state government in March, 2021 exceeded previous year's collection in the same month by Rs 3,030 crore. It signals greater economic activity, said finance minister Suresh Khanna on Tuesday. Addressing a press conference at his office, Khanna said total revenue of the state in March this year was Rs 16,476 crore, up from Rs 13,446 crore in March 2020, an increase of Rs 3,030 crore. The growth in revenue is mainly being credited to higher excise collections in March 2021 than last year. Excise remained the key contributor to revenue in the financial year 2020-21, despite the Covid lockdown and kept the state government’s cash registers ringing. In February 2021, when excise saw a drastic dip, the state treasury felt the pinch. The excise collection in February 2021 was only Rs 2,152 crore while in the same month last year it was Rs 4,171 crore, recording a decline of Rs 2,019 crore in revenue collection. The excise collection has been Rs 4,357 crore this time, much above Rs 1,838 crore last year, thus excise once again played an important role in state revenue, the minister said. The finance minister admitted the coronavirus triggered an economic slowdown due to which the financial targets set by the state government also lagged and were just 72% while in the last financial year it was nearly 88% of the fixed target. No development activities, welfare measures, salaries and pensions were affected in the state, even though the financial targets were not met, claimed the finance minister. The GST collection, too, witnessed a fall in March. Under the GST, the state collected only Rs 5,329 crore this time while in March 2020, it was Rs 7,051 crore, Khanna said. Under VAT, the total collection in March 2021 has been Rs 3,439 crore, while it was Rs 2,813 crore last year in the same month. The total tax revenue this time was Rs 2,824 crore higher than March 2020 and the non-tax revenue Rs 206 crore higher than last time, taking the total revenue collection hike to Rs 3,030 crore, said Khanna, adding the total collections in 2020-21 were just 72% of the target for the financial year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ups-mar-revenue-collection-rs-3030cr-more-than-last-yrs/articleshow/81940921.cms||---

AAP MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj said that the 130 crore people of the country should have the first right over the vaccine that has been developed by scientists of our country. AAP demanded that the vaccine should be made available free of cost to all Indian citizens. AAP workers gathered at their party headquarters in the morning and marched towards the BJP headquarters around noon. They were stopped by police outside the BJP headquarters. “The Covid vaccine was not created in the BJP headquarters. It was developed by scientists of our country. The number of Covid cases in the country is the highest in the world. People are losing their jobs and lives, but the central government is exporting the vaccine to 68 countries only for the Prime Minister to gain applause,” Bharadwaj said. “Before Pakistan and Afghanistan, every Indian citizen has the right to get vaccinated. If the vaccine is already available in our country, it must be made available to all,” he added. The AAP MLA said that once people are vaccinated, they would gain immunity from Covid and the country’s economic condition would significantly improve. “The government is not able to respond to the reasons for such control and regulation,” he said. Bharadwaj said that the central government says that vaccines will be given to those who need it, not those who want it. “But who decides who needs it? It is up to the doctors to decide who needs it and who doesn’t. The babus and leaders sitting in the government offices cannot decide this,” said Bharadwaj. “Indian Medical Association is saying that the vaccine must be provided to all. The government must listen to this instead of being obstinate,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-protests-outside-bjp-hq-over-vaccine-export/articleshow/81958377.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The civic body had earlier planned to dedicate over 1,000 beds for Covid. The junior doctors went on mass leave at around 4pm on Tuesday but called it off a few hours later after their demands were met. They have been opposing turning Nair into a complete Covid hospital, saying it would hamper their training in specialised branches of medicine. Doctors from GMC in Nagpur had threatened to withdraw services from Wednesday and KEM and Sion hospital doctors had backed the Nair residents. A Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors - Nair representative said one building on the campus and the OPD will be dedicated to Covid.

---||Chennai||Missing women of the judiciary||R Hemalatha“I measure the progress of a community by the degree of progress which women have achieved,’’ B R Ambedkar had said. Going by this, the judiciary isn’t faring too well. In the 74 years since Independence, women have held the high offices of the President, Prime Minister, and chief minister, but the corridors of Indian judiciary is yet to see a woman occupy its highest office — the Chief Justice of India.Over the past couple of years, various judgements were delivered by the Supreme Court on gender discrimination, sexual violence and coparcenary rights of women, but those involved in the decisions were not women. The present statistics shows women constitute nearly 48% of the country’s population, of which around 3% have made it to the highest courts of the various states, which again begs the question why no woman has been appointed as the Chief Justice of India.The country took almost 40 years to have its first woman judge, Justice Fathima Beevi in 1989. The count of women justices on the bench has been underwhelming too, as only two of these 80 women judges are in the Supreme Court and the remaining in various high courts, comprising only 7.2% of the total number of judges. There are many high courts across the country where there are no sitting women judges.Gender-diverse benches play a key role especially in the field of gender sensitivity in cases arising in courts. It reflects a judiciary that takes into account different opinions and concerns before coming to a conclusion. Empirical studies show that having even one woman on a three-judge bench influences the entire decision-making in gender discrimination and sensitive cases. Having women judges also encourages more women to approach the system of law to report violence and crimes.It is important to have women judges from diverse backgrounds to ensure structural changes in the decision-making process. Studies prove that personal values, experiences and other non-legal factors influence judicial decisions. If women in the judiciary hail from similar backgrounds as those of men, holding mainstream ideas and beliefs, the gender diversity has little to no payoff. Besides, the more socially diverse the judicial benches are, the stronger the judiciary is. This will improve public trust in the judiciary and increase access to justice.In India, voices have been demanding for better representation of women in the higher judiciary for quite some time now. The questions about women and judicial accountability are common, the lack of women’s representation in the judiciary cannot be discussed without addressing the core issue of elevation of women judges to that of their male counterparts.Attorney general K K Venugopal recently suggested that improving the representation of women in the Supreme Court could go a long way towards a balanced and empathetic approach in cases involving sexual violence. At present, the apex court has only two women judges as against a sanctioned strength of 34 judges. There are only 80 women judges, of the sanctioned strength of 1,113 judges in the high court and the Supreme Court, he said. Despite their competence, hard work and struggle, women lawyers are not recognised.If the criterion for elevation to the higher judiciary is based on merit coupled with equitable representation for the varied strata of society, it appears to be not working by design in the case of women. Highly successful women lawyers in the country have been consistently shunned or denied access to high offices without proper reason. While talented women are waiting in the wings, it is justice that is taking a beating.The representation of women in the higher judiciary of our country has been merely symbolic. The present composition of the apex judiciary does not appear to show any likelihood of a woman CJI occupying the high office any time soon. There needs to be an effective affirmative action plan to have an adequate number of prospective women candidates and ensure a judiciary representing the people of the country. As Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the second woman to serve as the Supreme Court Justice in the US and a lifelong advocate of gender equality, would often joke, there would be enough women on the nine-seat Supreme Court "when there are nine".(The writer is a Madras high court advocate)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/missing-women-of-the-judiciary/articleshow/81938389.cms||---

Academy shooters made their strong presence felt in the recently concluded ISSF World Cup, winning 6 medals of the total 30 bagged by the country. Established in 2007, the shooting academy has produced international stars and Tokyo Olympic quota holders like Chinki Yadav, Aishwarya Pratap Singh Tomar, Manisha Keer, Sunidhi Chauhan and many others. Even Olympic gold medallist shooter Abhinav Bindra, during his visit to inaugurate 10m and 25 m shooting which is named after him, had claimed that the shooting ranges in Bhopal are one of the best in the country.Shooting ranges have come up at the shooting academy on the outskirts of the state capital. In keeping with international standards, the academy comprises individual ranges of 10m, 25m, 50m and three stations of trap and skeet ranges in Goragaon area near the Sports Authority of India (SAI) centre.Experts say the ranges in Bhopal stand out as they offer the best in terms of modern facilities and equipment. Officials said the concept was derived from the dynamics of undulating the site and the functionality. To ensure best training to shooters, former international stars have been roped in as the mentors. Top coaches at the academy include Mansher Singh (shotgun), Suma Shirur (rifle) and Jaspal Rana (pistol).Sports minister Yashodhara Raje Scindia said that the efforts of the past 13 years have started paying dividends. “In 2007, when this shooting range was established, no one was ready to believe that one day this would give the country the finest shooters. Today results are in front of everyone,” said an elated Scindia. She added that excellent coaching staff and dedicated shooters have made the academy a best venue for both training and competitions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/medal-rush-turns-mp-academy-into-hub-for-shooters-stars-from-region/articleshow/81938402.cms||Ramendra Singh

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Multiple attacks on TMC Arambag candidate||ARANDI (Arambag): Hit on the head with a bamboo pole, smacked on her shoulders and back with bricks, kicked and pushed into a paddy field — this summarizes TMC’s Arambag candidate Sujata Mondal Khan’s poll day experience on Tuesday. But that was not enough to deter the 34-year-old candidate, who kept on visiting one sensitive booth after another in the interiors of Arambag even as purported BJP workers kept attacking her through the day. The windshield of her car was also damaged. Bordering Bankura and East Midnapore on either side, Arambag in Hooghly has contributed two former chief ministers to Bengal — Prafulla Chandra Sen and Ajoy Mukherjee — between 1962 and 1976. But not once since 1951, when this assembly segment was formed, the constituency has ever voted for a woman MLA. Trinamool’s Mondal, who happens to be the wife (currently going through a divorce proceeding) of BJP MP Saumitra Khan, vows to change the history. “I will be the first woman, that too from a scheduled tribe, to become an MLA from here.” “I consider myself an iron lady who goes by the principles of Rani Lakhsmi Bai and such attacks cannot break me physically and mentally. I am a fighter and I will fight till my last breath,” said Mondal. Mondal’s day started at 5am as she set out on her booth visit. Around 11am, she, along with a handful of TMC supporters and two security guards, entered the Arandi village following complaints that a sizeable Muslim population in the village were being stopped from going to booths by BJP workers. She stormed into the village on a bike, threatening BJP workers to break their hands. At Mohollapara, she led a procession of voters to the voting booth. But halfway to the booth, a group of men and women armed with sticks, bamboo poles, bricks and stones came charging at her. Mondal was pushed to the paddy field as villagers rained stones and bricks on her, resulting her security guard to flash the gun. But, he didn’t fire as the men backed off. Mondal literally had to run along the paddy field to reach a safe zone. Cops and CRPF personnel reached later as Mondal levelled allegations of favoritism and corruption on the local inspector in charge. BJP candidate Madhusudan Bag, meanwhile, claimed Mondal and his men attacked a pregnant woman and kicked a bowl of rice that triggered the assault. At the end of the day, the booth recorded 61% votes, 18% less than district average. She later faced attacks at Dihibagan and Paisara villages as well where villagers attacked her car with stones and bamboo poles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/multiple-attacks-on-tmc-arambag-candidate/articleshow/81938428.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||India||Covid-19: Delayed testing, poor collection of swabs behind false negatives||MUMBAI: As the second wave of the pandemic intensifies, doctors say there is a group of patients who despite displaying classic Covid-19 symptoms is testing negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The reasons range from poor collection of swab samples, delayed testing after the appearance of the first symptoms or variants that have possibly changed the disease patterns. Dr Pratit Samdhani from the state-run JJ Hospital, Byculla, said there are definitely some patients who are not testing positive despite having symptoms such as fever, cough and body ache. “If the virus isn’t tested in the third to seventh day after the first symptoms appear, there is a higher chance of false negative,” said a doctor with a BMC hospital. However, not all patients are clear about when they started getting symptoms: some get one-day fever followed by severe cough while others begin with blocked nose. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Om Shrivastava from Jaslok Hospital said one of the reasons for the false negative could be the fact that the RT-PCR test, which is considered the best to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has a sensitivity between 65 and 70%. “Tests are not 100% positive, but just because a test is unable to pick up the virus, one cannot exclude the infection. Doctors have to rely on their clinical judgement,” he said. At such times, doctors have to depend on the CT scan of the chest to establish the diagnosis. The Covid lung has a distinctive glassy appearance that cannot be missed, said Samdhani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-delayed-testing-poor-collection-of-swabs-behind-false-negatives/articleshow/81942233.cms||---

Any cooperative housing society with more than five active Covid cases shall be sealed and treated as a micro-containment zone, the BMC has said. Such a society needs to put up a board at its gate informing visitors and denying them entry. All deliveries will have to be at the “society office”. The civic circular has made it clear it will be the “duty” of society office-bearers to seal the flats containing asymptomatic patients. Police personnel posted in each of these micro-containment zones “shall ensure ingress and egress of the micro-containment zone and they should also oversee the strict implementation of these guidelines by the office-bearers of the society”, the BMC said, adding that in case of lapses, they will bring these to the notice of civic ward officials. The circular further stated, “No egress shall be allowed except with the concurrence of the secretary/chairman of the society and police deployed in each of these micro-containment zones, that too for exceptional cases only like medical emergencies and board exams of the students”. It reiterated that an asymptomatic patient in home isolation shall not move out of the flat and if found violating this rule, an FIR will be filed by ward officials against the person. However, BMC health officials and medical professionals will be entitled to visit and enter such micro-containment zones for monitoring purposes. Also, home collection of swabs in such zones by testing laboratories through their employees in proper gear shall be allowed. Authorities of all the wards in the city have been directed to ensure strict compliance of these SOPs with the help of police personnel by keeping them informed via a letter to the commissioner of police. Zonal deputy municipal commissioners have been asked to monitor the implementation of the SOPs by making surprise visits and phone calls to such places. The Maharashtra government on Sunday evening issued guidlines for what it called was the ‘Break the Chain’ phase in view of the second wave of coronavirus cases. The civic corporation’s circular on micro-containment zones came in with its details on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-can-leave-sealed-bldgs-for-exams-emergencies/articleshow/81941028.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Dehradun||Pegged at measly ‘Rs 2,500-3,000 per ha’, Uttarakhand’s burnt forest rated too low, experts say need to revise 1988 forest policy||Dehradun: The Uttarakhand government has pegged the value of its one hectare of burnt forests at Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,000 based on a policy that dates back to 1988. Activists say the state is simply ignoring myriad features of its forests like its forest rivulets, rich soil, microbes and endless brown fauna (snakes, insects, butterflies etc) while doing evaluation of its forest wealth that is getting burnt. The issue was recently raised by Doon-based social activist Anoop Nautiyal in the wake of the raging forest fires in the Himalayan state. Other environmental experts, too, concur on the low evaluation.“It is high time that India’s National Forest Policy of 1988 be revised so that forests are evaluated correctly countrywide as we have fire season almost throughout the year now barring monsoon. We have to take climate change, pollution as well as the rights of forest dwellers and villagers living in the fringe forest areas into consideration while formulating the policy,” said environmentalist Anil Prakash Joshi. India’s first National Forest Policy (NFP) came into effect in 1952 and was revised in 1988. It was in 2018 that the formal draft of a new NFP was unveiled and then in 2019 it was revised. However, the new NFP is yet to see daylight. Experts say that the NFP needs to be revised as some of the key issues like forest management by the locals, tribals and forest policies are till date left open-ended. Meanwhile, head of forest force Rajiv Bhartari said, “The rates of forest burnt per hectare will be revised, and currently, the rates are decided based on mathematical calculation under expert directions. These are based on around eight different parameters of the forests.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pegged-at-measly-rs-2500-3000-per-ha-uttarakhands-burnt-forest-rated-too-low-experts-say-need-to-revise-1988-forest-policy/articleshow/81937629.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Chennai||Where the church bells toll 190 yrs on||This Easter Sunday was special for Ooty residents in more ways than one. The hill station’s first ever church, St Stephen’s, celebrated its 190th anniversary.With a seating capacity of 144, it was opened for public worship on Easter Sunday, April 3, 1831. Rev R Arunthilagam, the 85th chaplain of the institution, said, "It was a coincidence that we observed the 190th anniversary of the church on Easter Sunday, April 4, though a day later to the original date."The structure is proof of the colonial past as the roof was built with teak timber brought from Tipu Sultan’s Palace at Seringapatanam in then Mysore state after the British victory in 1799.Fredrick Price, author of ‘Ootacamund A History’, writes, "On the 28th of February 1829, the chief secretary, who had accompanied Lushington to Ootacamund, wrote thence, in the name of government, to the superintendent of the Gun Carriage Factory at Seringapatanam, directing him to pull down the old Lal Bagh Palace on the island there..."The church was consecrated on December 5, 1830, by Bishop John Matthias Turner of Calcutta, although it was not actually completed at the time. According to records, the church got its first organ in 1844, bought from J W Walker & Co in London. However, it was sold in 1864 to make room for a new organ manufactured by Messrs Hill Brothers in July 1864. That organ is still there. R Ramola, a member of the church, said, "The church maintains its heritage value. The old organ, which is in good condition, is used on occasions".S Scott, a resident of the town, said, "St Stephen’s church, located at the heart of the hill town, is the pride of Ooty when it comes to heritage."It is the only church in Ooty that still conducts services in English. "About 80 families including about 10 Anglo Saxon households attached to the church enthusiastically took part in the anniversary function held on Sunday," said Arunthilagam. The celebration was muted in view of the still raging Covid-19 pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/where-the-church-bells-toll-190-yrs-on/articleshow/81938409.cms||---

A pall of gloom descended on the temple town after the mortal remains of the jawan reached here late on Monday night. Thousands of people from all walks of life paid last respects to the departed soul. The cremation was held in the afternoon on the banks of river Saryu. Rajkumar’s son Shivam Yadav (16) demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should order a surgical strike to tackle Naxal menace. “It will be the real tribute to all the jawans who laid down their lives in ambush,” he said. Ramvilas Yadav, younger brother of the jawan who lit the funeral pyre, also appealed to PM Modi to conduct air strikes on naxals. He demanded that Uttar Pradesh government should double the compensation of Rs 50 lakh and offer medical help to his mother who is a cancer patient. CM Yogi Adityanath has announced financial assistance of Rs 50 lakh each to the families of the martyrs and government job to a member of the family.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Poor turnout in Tvm’s key constituencies||Thiruvananthapuram: The district did not give any surprises this time as the constituencies recorded a very low turnout when compared to that of 2016 assembly elections. Even the district recorded an overall 70.01% which is very less when compared to other districts. The two constituencies Nemom and Vattiyoorkavu, where fierce triangular fights were witnessed, has recorded a very poor turnout this time. The BJP is keeping high hopes in these two seats. If Nemom recorded 74.24% polling in 2016, it touched only 69.8% this time. Similar was the situation in Kazhakkoottam where the voter turnout was 69.63% when it was 73.7% in 2016. The lowest voter turnout in the district was recorded in Thiruvananthapuram constituency at 61.92%. This constituency too witnessed a triangular contest and even in past elections it has seen a very poor voter turnout. In 2016, this constituency recorded the lowest polling in the district with 65.36%. Another constituency that received poor polling percentage was Vattiyoorkavu where only 64.16% was recorded this time. It was 70.23% in 2016 and in the bypoll held in 2019 here the polling percentage was 62.66%. Apart from these four constituencies, all the other ten constituencies recorded over 69% polling. Varkala (70.23%), Attingal (70.61%), Chirayinkeezhu (70.79%), Nedumangadu (71.54%), Vamanapuram (70.90%), Aruvikkara (73.27%), Parassala (72.41%), Kattakada (72.21%), Kovalam (70.76%) and Neyyattinkara (72.23%).

In Kattayikonam under this constituency the supporters of BJP and CPM had a clash and a few people were injured. BJP candidate Shoba Surendran and CPM candidate Kadakampally Surendran came out with allegations against each other’s party for unleashing violence. The district witnessed heavy polling till afternoon and by 2pm the polling percentage had touched 50%. However, it went slow in the evening. Even the coastal areas of the district witnessed a low voter turnout.

---||Mumbai||BMC retaking private hospitals & centres, starting at Dharavi||MUMBAI: With a surge in Covid-19 cases, BMC is reacquiring private hospitals and centres it had shut down last year after cases started ebbing. BMC reacquired Sai Hospital, the first dedicated Covid-19 hospital, for Dharavi. “We decided to reacquire the entire hospital. This will once again be a dedicated Covid hospital for patients from Dharavi. It has regular and ICU beds with ventilators and oxygen support beds,” said Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner (G-North ward). BMC had last April taken over the 51-bed private hospital for an isolation centre for patients from Dharavi. This was the first time BMC took over an entire hospital with doctors, technicians, nurses and other staff under Epidemic Diseases Act to tackle the outbreak in Asia’s largest slum. Last year, BMC also acquired District Sports Complex near Dharavi for housing high-risk contacts. The facility was used as an isolation centre. BMC had set up a 300-bed facility at the sports complex. On Monday BMC said Dharavi recorded 47 new cases. The number of cases in Dharavi was 5,238 on Monday. In G-South ward (Worli, Lower Parel and Prabhadevi), BMC has taken back space at Nehru Science Centre, where it will add 200 beds, more space at NSCI complex to add 250 beds and Podar Hospital, 200 beds. “We will add 650 more beds in view of a rise in cases. We want to ensure patients from the ward get a bed in the ward itself. Most beds will have oxygen support and some at NSCI will have an ICU,” said Sharad Ughade, assistant municipal commissioner (G-South ward). In T ward (Mulund), BMC recently opened its 275-bed Covid centre at Mithagar School after two Covid hospitals in Mulund Bhandup belt were shut down following fires, to tackle a scramble for beds. Kishore Gandhi, assistant municipal commissioner (T ward) said, “We restarted the centre at Mithaghar. We started 60 beds and in a week, we will increase it to 275. We are also starting dialysis for Covid patients here. We will restart the Covid centre at Mulund octroi naka if there is a shortage of beds.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-retaking-pvt-hosps-centres-starting-at-dharavi/articleshow/81941047.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Panic buying after lockdown talks||AHMEDABAD: Minutes after the Gujarat high court bench of chief justices underlined the need for a three- to four-day lockdown in the state to curb the spread of Covid-19 cases and break the chain, rampant panic buying followed. People in different parts of the city thronged markets, grocery shops, PDS shops and departmental stores to stock up on their monthly supplies. Serpentine queues of people were seen outside a departmental store in Satellite area of the city and people hoarded groceries making bulk purchases. Immense crowding was also seen at the Kalupur Chokha Bazar from 4pm onwards in Ahmedabad. Sumit Singh, a resident of Prahladnagar, said, “The situation is getting unpredictable by the day and therefore, I came in to buy essential supplies so that I don’t have to keep moving out time and again.” In Bopal area of the city, major departmental stores were forced to shut shop by 6.30pm itself because they ran out of stock and there was an added rush of people. “People thronged our shop in huge numbers and we had to ask them to wait in queue. Due to more rush, we were compelled to shut shop early because we were going out of stock. We will probably prohibit entry inside the shop and instead make it delivery-only or allow only one person at a time as people are making bulk purchases purely out of panic,” said Manish Patel, a grocer in Vejalpur area of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/panic-buying-after-lockdown-talks/articleshow/81938424.cms||---

---||Lucknow||BJP men tasked to ensure supporters cast their vote||Lucknow: Election management has emerged a key word for BJP in West Bengal and the biggest task for its strategists is to get the party’s supporter to cast their vote. Increasing its winning tally in West Bengal from 3 seats in 2016 assembly elections to 150+ seats in 2021 is a tough call for BJP. Union home minister Amit Shah had said BJP would win 200 out of 294 assembly seats in the state. And to make it happen there are the party’s organizational architects including senior office-bearers from UP BJP and star campaigners, who have been camping in West Bengal working relentlessly on election management. West Bengal assembly election is different from elections in UP. “In UP, if the candidate is exposed for his wrongdoings and criminal activities ahead of the voting day, there are chances he would lose elections because the voter is free to exercise his franchise. In West Bengal, he could win because of the syndicate of people who could influence voters and election results. We wish to break this syndicate,” said UP BJP vice president, JPS Rathore, who is camping in West Bengal. Under the party’s strategy, mobilisation of voters is happening at two levels. While the organizational experts are making the party structure strong so that it could reach out to maximum voters, star campaigners are telling voters what BJP has done for people through its welfare schemes at the Centre and in states where the party is in power. Apart from PM Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and UP CM Yogi Adityanath, another sought-after leader is Union minister Smriti Irani. “She can speak in Bangla,” said Rathore. Party leaders Manoj Tiwari and Ravi Kishen are the other star campaigners. In West Bengal, where cadre-based parties like Left, Congress and TMC have been in power for years, the booth level party worker is more dominating an entity than a party leader and mobilises voters more than any other factor. And, in a state like this, BJP is building up its own workforce. Though an organizational structure as robust as in BJP-ruled states is missing in West Bengal at this point of time, BJP workers and leaders from states like UP, MP, Bihar, Rajasthan, Delhi, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and others are filling in the void. Booth-level meetings have become important as they help the party reach out to the voter. Apart from the workers of West Bengal BJP, those that have come from other states have been assigned responsibilities like crowd management at election rallies and conversion of support the party enjoys among people into vote. BJP sees itself strong in North Bengal in Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling and weak in Murshidabad and Malda. The party is working to make itself stronger in localities where it is already in a better position. Unlike UP, where BJP is known as a party with an urban base, in West Bengal it has a stronger presence in rural areas. “This could be because of the Hindu vote in rural areas,” said Rathore. The party has its eyes set on the fourth and fifth phase of elections on April 10 and April 17 when the localities where BJP sees itself in a strong position would go to polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-men-tasked-to-ensure-supporters-cast-their-vote/articleshow/81941040.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Aurangabad||More rain & hailstorm activity expected in Marathwada region||Aurangabad: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicated rain or thundershowers in Aurangabad and parts of Marathwada for about 72 hours beginning April 10. The Agro-Meteorological section of the Parbhani-based Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University has also issued a forecast of hailstorm activity in some parts of the region. “Hingoli, Jalna, Parbhani and Nanded districts are likely to witness extreme weather events starting this weekend. The farming community, among others, are advised to take note of the adverse forecast,” agricultural meteorologist K K Dakhore said. Another extreme event is likely to take a toll on the hot-weather crops that are cultivated in many parts of the region due to adequate storage in the dams. Parts of Marathwada had witnessed hailstorm and unseasonal rainfall for a brief period in February and March that had caused damage to crops and orchards on hundreds of acres. Predicting more frequent occurrences of extreme weather events in Marathwada — excluding the monsoon season — weather experts have sought the installation of a Doppler radar for the region to issue accurate and timely alerts. Meanwhile, the mercury level crossed the 40 degree celsius-mark in Aurangabad and other parts of the region for the second consecutive day on Tuesday. At 40.1 degrees celsius, the maximum temperature in Aurangabad was above normal by two units. The minimum temperature in the city was 23.3 degrees celsius, which was also a positive deviation of two units from normal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/more-rain-hailstorm-activity-expected-in-marathwada-region/articleshow/81938412.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand High Court directs top forest official to list steps taken to tackle wildfires||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court on Tuesday directed the principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) of the state to personally appear before it on Wednesday and explain the steps taken by the government to tackle the wildfires raging in the hill districts. The directions were issued by a bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma which took cognisance of the issue after advocate Dushyant Mainali mentioned the matter before the division bench on Monday. The court has asked the PCCF to explain if the forest fires are a yearly phenomenon and why no action plan has been made to control their spread yet. It also asked the official what the forest department and the government have been doing throughout the year to curb the menace. Speaking to TOI, Mainali said, “I had mentioned the issue before the court on Monday morning and the bench initiated suo motu proceedings taking into record my statement. A similar petition was initiated in 2018 too when massive fires broke out in the state.” He added that numerous hearings were held back then too but the plea went dormant since no guidelines were issued. Meanwhile, the advocate on Monday submitted fresh news reports and images captured by Isro satellites to show the extent of damage caused by the fires after which the court took cognisance of the matter. Mainali said that the much-publicised use of IAF helicopters to douse the fires are only temporary and not a long-term solution to the menace. “There are several reasons why the use of choppers is not feasible to put out forest fires. It is best to work with locals who have been using traditional methods to deal with such fires,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-hc-directs-top-forest-official-to-list-steps-taken-to-tackle-wildfires/articleshow/81937654.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Relief at no lockdown, but curfew to hit business||AHMEDABAD: As the state government announced the extension of the night curfew, now from 8pm to 6am in 20 cities of Gujarat, the restaurant and hospitality sector is staring at gloomy days. While industry players are relieved no lockdown is being imposed, they claim the extended curfew timings and reduced cap on guests at weddings will hurt the industry. Business in the restaurants and hospitality sector was barely in recovery mode when the curfew was imposed in mid-March. After the Gujarat high court suggested that the government take appropriate action to curb the spread of Covid-19 in the state, Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani announced a few restrictions. Besides extending the length of the night curfew by an hour, it was also extended to 20 cities instead of just the eight municipal corporations. Besides Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, Rajkot, Jamnagar, Bhavnagar, Junagadh and Gandhinagar, night curfew will also be imposed in Anand, Nadiad, Mehsana, Morbi, Patan, Godhra, Dahod, Bhuj, Gandhidham, Bharuch, Surendranagar and Amreli. The government has also reduced the cap on wedding guests from 200 to 100. The decision will deal a huge blow to restaurants and hotels. While restaurant business was already in doldrums since mid-March as the night curfew has been in place, the extension by an hour will force most restaurants to shut shop in the evening and operate in ‘takeaway only’ mode. Meanwhile, hotels in Ahmedabad did good business over the past couple of months with inquiries pouring in for weddings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/relief-at-no-lockdown-but-curfew-to-hit-biz/articleshow/81938466.cms||---

---||Goa||From today, seminars to educate students, public on new MV Act||Panaji: Educational drives by transport officers to create awareness about the implementation of the new Motor Vehicle (Amendment) Act 2019, will commence from Wednesday, April 7 onwards. Transport minister Mauvin Godinho said that a series of seminars have been planned to educate school students and the public about the same. The state government has notified the revised penalties for the violation of traffic rules in Goa under the new MV Act and that it will be implemented in the state from May 1 onwards. “We will use this time to create awareness among the people about the implementation of the MV Act. In the jurisdiction of every assistant director of transport, the public will be informed about the new MV Act and in some cases transport officials will visit schools and colleges. The key tone is to not break traffic rules to avoid paying fines, follow the law and observe strict discipline on the road to prevent accidents and loss of life,” he said. “We are going to make an extra effort to publicise the enhanced fines in an effort to make people aware that fines have increased, and they will be penalised for breaking traffic rules. The main target audience is college students,” a transport official said. The transport department on Monday has empowered the traffic police, assistant directors of transport and RTO officers to prosecute the traffic violators and impose fines under the Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/from-today-seminars-to-educate-students-public-on-new-mv-act/articleshow/81941100.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Poll closure of bars may spoil Poila Baisakh party for tipplers||Kolkata: The  in the city and adjacent areas may spoil the Poila Baisakh-week party for tipplers as bars and liquor off-shops will stay shut 48 hours, or even 96 hours, in the run-up to the poll days. While the Bengali New Year will be celebrated on April 15, polls in parts of Kolkata and nearby places will be on April 10 and 17, besides on April 26 and 29. An EC directive says liquor on-shops and off-shops should be closed for 48 hours in a constituency, where polls are held. Bar and restaurant owners said liquor sales constitute almost 50% of their revenue. According to Hotel and and Restaurants Association of Eastern India (HRAEI), the sales are now down by 30%-35% than the peak sales in December-January. With extensive areas of south Kolkata, including Kasba, Tollygunge, Jadavpur, Behala East and West, Maheshtala, Budge Budge, Metiabruz, and a large part of urban Howrah and Hooghly being slated for elections on April 10, liquor sale there will be stopped from 6pm-6.30pm on April 8. Depending on the sensitivity of the localities, the excise department even shuts bars and off-shops in adjoining areas. “During the election in East Midnapore, liquor sales were closed in some areas of West Midnapore. But such a rule depends on the area. The EC order talks about shops in the constituency going to polls. Rules for shops in adjacent areas fall under the advisory of EC,” a state excise official said. Restaurants and bars in the city, which have been witnessing a fall in the footfalls over the past fortnight owing to rising Covid cases, the financial year-ending and the elections, were hoping for a revival in the Poila Baisakh week. Pradip Rozario, owner of KK’s Fusion and Mio Amore, said they had received information that his bar-cum-restaurants would be shut for 96 hours in two tranches. “I heard our bar would be closed from April 15 till the end of polling on April 17 and then again, from April 27 to April 29,” he said. His establishments are on the border of Bidhannagar and Maniktala, which are slated for polls on April 17 and April 29. HRAEI president Sudesh Poddar, who owns restaurants Songhay and Manthan, said his restaurants in the Chowringhee constituency would be shut from the evening of April 27 till the election on April 29. But, he said, he had not received any notification about closure for polls in adjacent areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/poll-closure-of-bars-may-spoil-poila-baisakh-party-for-tipplers/articleshow/81938527.cms||---
---||Pune||PMC eases curbs, brings vet hospitals & petrol pumps in essential category||Pune: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Tuesday announced some relaxations in its “break-the-chain” orders, exempting firms involved in building basic IT infrastructure, data centres and cloud computing from the restrictions imposed to further curb the spread of Covid-19 cases and including pet shops and veterinary hospitals in the essential services category. A PMC official said petrol pumps and establishments dealing in petroleum products would also be in the essential services category. “The PMC had issued orders on April 5 to control the spread of Covid-19. An updated order was issued by adding some more essential services on Tuesday,” PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar said. The new directives will be effective from April 7 to 30. The latest order allows students appearing for various examinations to travel during the restricted hours (6pm-7am, Friday to Monday) between home and examination centres. They would, however, have to carry their hall tickets. The order stated that people working in private firms in various shifts could travel in private or company vehicles, but have to carry along office identity cards. People reaching Pune from other places would be allowed to go home, but they would have to carry the travel tickets with them. Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) buses have been partially allowed to transport people in essential services. PMPML will operate 41 buses on 20 routes from 6am to 9pm for people involved in essential services. However, people would be able to avail of the services by showing their identity cards. The order included all cargo and courier services, as well as government and private security services, in the essential category. Fruit vendors and meat and eggs shops are also on the same list. Site offices of private builders and architecture firms will be allowed to operate from Monday to Friday between 7am and 6pm. All the sites of Metro rail in the PMC limits will continue to work. Micro finance services, establishments under Sebi and RBI and non-banking financial firms can also operate. Though the religious places have been kept closed, the priests and people performing rituals in these places will be allowed entry. The administration clarified that marriages already planned would be allowed within the restricted hours, but an NOC from a deputy commissioner or incidental commander and the police station concerned would be a must. The district administration also issued an order on the same lines of the PMC’s directive. Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash said, “The industrial units with 500 and more employees must have their own isolation centre and doctors. People working in industries or involved in essential services must get vaccinated, or they have to undergo RT-PCR tests in accordance with the state government’s orders. We will check the certificates after April 10.” Till Tuesday afternoon, liquor stores in Pimpri Chinchwad were open as the civic body was yet to issue an order. Most of the shops witnessed crowding of customers. All the shops were closed after the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation issued the orders.

---||Lucknow||UP BJP spreads PM’s message to garner support in panchayat polls||LUCKNOW: After PM Narendra Modi chose BJP’s 41st foundation day on Tuesday to mount a scathing attack on the opposition accusing it of peddling false narratives on issues like new farm laws and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the UP BJP took the message down to rural precincts to blunt opposition’s aggression and consolidate its position in panchayat elections. “The PM’s message on key issues was percolated down to the grass roots,” UP BJP general secretary Govind Narayan Shukla told TOI after the PM’s address. BJP sources said the party used LED screens, computers and other devices to take the PM’s message to the people in over 2,700 locations across the state. These included 1,918 divisions, 98 organisational districts and nearly 700 strategic locations, many of them in politically volatile west UP region. A senior party leader said the PM’s message, which sought to corner the opposition on a host of issues related to farmers, poor and middle-class electorate, would benefit the party ahead of political showdown in the ensuing panchayat elections. “The foundation day has given party functionaries a chance to make an aggressive bid to take on political rivals in coming days,” said UP BJP vice-president and party’s panchayat election in charge Vijay Bahadur Pathak. On this occasion, the party dispatched booklets detailing its history and struggle of its leaders in the last 41 years. The booklet, titled ‘Itihas Vikas Ka…BJP ki Gaurav Gatha’ was also circulated among party functionaries through social media platforms which will be forwarded to party supporters. While the function organised in the state BJP headquarters was attended by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, state unit chief Swatantra Dev Singh and state general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal, the party asked public representatives, including MPs and MLAs, to actively participate in functions organised in their respective constituencies while following Covid-19 protocol. Party flags were also hoisted atop the houses of 1.63 lakh booth level presidents and district offices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-bjp-spreads-pms-message-to-garner-support-in-panchayat-polls/articleshow/81941073.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Nagpur||DyCF Shivkumar charged with causing RFO Chavan’s miscarriage||Nagpur: Dharni police has slapped three more IPC sections, including the charge of causing miscarriage, against deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) Vinod Shivkumar — accused in the Harisal RFO Deepali Chavan suicide case — after finding further evidence against him. Based on the suicide note, the investigating officer and sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Poonam Patil dug into the allegations that Shivkumar was responsible for her miscarriage and found some medical papers. Patil also recorded statements of the forest staff and during investigation, found that Shivkumar was responsible for the miscarriage of Chavan. The staff also revealed that the deputy conservator used to abuse Chavan and insult her regularly over the phone and in person. Amravati superintendent of police (SP) Hari Balaji said, “On March 25, the day when the RFO shot herself and left a suicide note holding Shivkumar responsible for her death, we had booked the accused under Section 306 (abetment to suicide).” Balaji added, “On April 4, we have slapped sections 312 (punishment for causing miscarriage), 504 (intentional insult), 506 (criminal intimidation) and submitted it before the court. Further investigations are on.” When asked whether suspended APCCF MS Reddy has been made co-accused as the Achalpur additional sessions judge SK Mungliwar rejected his anticipatory bail application, Balaji said, “It has not been done as an inquiry about his role in the suicide case is still going on. His statements were also recorded.” However, the detailed court orders state, “It is crystal clear that the offence is of serious nature. The applicant (Reddy) had knowledge of all atrocities sustained by the deceased at the hands of accused Shivkumar in the form of oral complaint and electronic record, but did not take any action against him.” “The applicant Reddy has supported accused Shivkumar by purposefully avoiding the performance of his duties after receiving complaints from the deceased. The acts of Reddy are supporting in nature to the acts of the accused. Hence, he is not entitled to get bail,” the court had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dycf-shivkumar-charged-with-causing-rfo-chavans-miscarriage/articleshow/81937641.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Though judicial work was has been going on through video-conferencing for past one year, since the Covid-triggered lockdown, all the benches started hearing cases according to the roster. The standing committee’s meeting took place on Tuesday afternoon and it was decided that only seven benches will be functioning irrespective of the present roster. According to the new arrangement, four benches will hear criminal matters and remaining three benches will look after civil cases. Meanwhile, the high court has decided to get the entire campus sanitized from April 10 to April 14, and a circular said that the high court and its registry will remain closed on April 12. The sanitization of all the buildings will start from Saturday. During a hearing on Tuesday, when the government law officers were specially called by the division bench, Chief Justice Vikram Nath said that Covid-19 situation is deteriorating across India, but since it is concerned with the Gujarat state and its judiciary, the high court decided to take up the issue. He said, “The staff at high court is working under pressure, and not voluntarily. There are 8-10 cases on an average in the high court. The situation is equally bad in other places and judges are falling ill in the districts.” He cited an example of former registrar general, who is now appointed as a district judge, and who has seriously taken ill with Covid-19. He said that the judicial officer has been shifted to a hospital from district places, but the standing committee will immediately take a decision in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-to-reduce-judicial-work-sanitize-campus/articleshow/81938520.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Labs delaying results to face action, says BMC||Following complaints of how testing laboratories were taking more than a day to share Covid reports with patients and the civic body, BMC chief I S Chahal in a circular issued on Monday said laboratories violating guidelines shall be liable to face strict action, including cancellation of licence. He has also directed all Covid testing laboratories to give priority to symptomatic patients over asymptomatic ones. “It is observed that in the last 15 days, there is a surge in Covid cases and laboratories are not following the guidelines of maintaining 24 hours turnaround time (TAT) and sharing reports directly with the patients first before sharing it with the MCGM. This is adversely affecting the allotment of beds to needy patients by the ward war rooms,” stated the circular.  The BMC has reiterated labs have to comply with TAT of 24 hours from receipt of sample to test and to upload test reports on the ICMR portal first and then to intimate positive status to the patient the subsequent day. The samples received by labs in the first half of the day, i.e. by 2 pm, should be tested and uploaded on the ICMR site the same day or before 11.59 pm, and the positive report is to be released the subsequent day to the patient.

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand wildfires: IAF chopper fails to take off in Kumaon for 2nd day, over 1,700 ha gutted in 1,257 incidents so far||Dehradun: The Indian Air Force (IAF) Mi-17 helicopter deployed in Kumaon, the region which has seen more than 50 active fires in the last two days, failed to take off on the second day as well, due to poor visibility and hostile weather conditions. In Garhwal, the other chopper continued its operations on Tuesday and was able to pour water over Khrisu, Pauri and Kirtinagar areas in four sorties. “The IAF could not proceed with extinguishing operations in Kumaon even today, due to poor visibility caused by smoke from the fires, stormy weather and clouds. However, they were able to douse fires in four locations at Pauri Garhwal and Tehri Garhwal,” said Rajiv Bhartari, head of forest force, Uttarakhand. With the rich biodiversity of Nainital and surrounding areas like Corbett Tiger Reserve at risk, the forest department has also increased the number of firefighters on the ground. Over two dozen active fires were spotted in forest ranges around Bhowali, Manora, North Gola, and Nainital areas in the last three days. Boating in Bhimtal lake has been stopped, considering the safety of tourists and in order to ensure smooth functioning of IAF choppers so they can lift water from the lake uninterrupted. TR Bijulal, divisional forest officer (DFO), Naintial, said, “The smog caused by fire and dust in the air made it impossible for the helicopter to operate. The chopper landed in Haldwani from Bareilly on Monday but so far, it hasn’t been able to lift water from Bhimtal lake due to strong winds and low visibility. Meanwhile, we have increased the number of staffers on ground from around 200 firewatchers to over 250 now. There are only a few active fires left in Nainital now. Our main concern was the Oak forest, we have managed to stop it from burning now.” Oak trees play a great role in maintaining ground water level as they are considered to be next to glaciers for their water-retention capacity. Forest minister Harak Singh Rawat has appealed to the people of Uttarakhand to douse any flames they spot rather than waiting for forest officials to arrive. Meanwhile, a video of him trying to put out a blazing fire with a slender tree branch has drawn flak on social media for making a ‘photo-op’ out of a sensitive moment. The state had last week requested the Centre for helicopters to be pressed into service to douse growing wildfires. On Sunday, chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat had reached out to union home minister Amit Shah and called an emergency meeting of officials over the issue. The choppers landed in Uttarakhand on Monday morning. However, the operation over forests of Tehri had to be called off after two sorties and the chopper in Garhwal failed to take off due to low visibility. In the last six months, Uttarakhand has lost over 1,793 hectares of land to wildfires - 1,122 hectares in Garhwal region, 622 hectares in Kumaon and 49 hectares in wildlife (protected areas). In the last 24 hours, 75 forest fires occurred in the state, burning 105.55 hectares of forest cover, leading to a loss of Rs 2.22 lakh to the exchequer, according to the forest department. According to official figures, four persons and seven animals have been killed till now. However, villagers contest these claims and insist the actual figures are higher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-wildfires-iaf-chopper-fails-to-take-off-in-kumaon-for-2nd-day-over-1700-ha-gutted-in-1257-incidents-so-far/articleshow/81937648.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: New home minister promises no ‘political interference’ for police||MUMBAI: Senior NCP leader Dilip Walse Patil, who took charge as Maharashtra home minister on Tuesday, said he will work towards strengthening the image of the police force and ensure that there is no political interference in the working of the department. Patil has replaced NCP’s Anil Deshmukh who tendered his resignation to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday after the Bombay high court ordered a CBI investigation into the corruption allegations levelled by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh. “My focus will be to maintain a clean image of the police and bring out transparency in their working. The common man should be able to trust the police. The department is a profession system and it should work like that without any political interference,” said Patil. On the HC-directed preliminary inquiry against Deshmukh, Walse Patil said that his ministry will extend full cooperation to the CBI. However, he added, the Maha Vikas Aghadi government will challenge the HC order in the Supreme Court. The minister assured that police transfers will be done as per the norms, and that police housing and recruitment will be expedited.“This is a very challenging and difficult time for the department. Due to pandemic, the entire force is on the street today to implement the restrictions announced by the government. Steps will be taken to strengthen the police force,” he said. When asked how sensitive information from the home department seems to be leaked to leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis, Patil said that since Fadnavis was the chief minister and also the home minister for five years, it is obvious that he is in touch with people in the department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-new-home-minister-promises-no-political-interference-for-police/articleshow/81939761.cms||Bhavika Jain

Earlier in the day, CM Rawat, along with other senior state officials and Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad seers, offered prayer at the Har-Ki-Pauri ghat. He also sought blessings from Acharya Mahamandleshwar Swami Kailashanand Giri and Swami Rajrajeshwarashram. Addressing media persons, the CM said that the state government completed all works in time to ensure a divine and grand Kumbh Mela. He reiterated that pilgrims across the country are free to visit the Kumbh Mela but they must follow Covid-19 guidelines. In an apparent reference to the recent episode involving the alleged manhandling of additional mela officer Harbeer Singh, the CM said, “All the officers have done a good job despite Covid-19 challenges. Some problems could surface but that doesn’t justify such incidents. I will take action against the bad officers when necessary but also appreciate the good ones.” Meanwhile, Trikal Bhavanta, the self-appointed head of Pari akhada (an akhada of women which is not registered with the Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad), sat on the Ganga puja stage which is reserved for akhada seers. On objection of akhada seers, the additional mela officer asked her to move but she stood her ground. Finally, women police officers approached her and she shifted. Notably, this was CM's first visit to Haridwar after recovering from Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cm-inaugurates-kumbh-media-centre-dedicates-projects-worth-rs-150-crore-to-people-in-haridwar/articleshow/81937656.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Ahmedabad||High court: Remind judges of CrPC provisions...||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court has quashed a Bhachau court’s order for framing of charges in Jayanti Bhanushali murder case and ordered that all sessions judges of Gujarat be reminded how a trial starts according to CrPC, before the process is forgotten. One of the six accused persons in the Jayanti Bhanushali murder of 2019, Manisha Goswami, approached the HC complaining that the sessions court in Bhachau on February 2 ordered framing of charges in the case. Her advocate J M Panchal submitted that the prosecution did not make any opening statement, nor was any opportunity granted to the accused to seek discharge and the court directly ordered framing of charges. The lawyer asserted that this was in violation of the procedure prescribed for starting a trial in a sessions court under Sections 226 to 228 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). The special public prosecutor was also absent when the court passed the order and there was no opening statement made by the prosecution, it was submitted by citing the rojkam of the case before the Bhachau court. After hearing the case, Justice S H Vora observed that there was a failure on the part of the court to follow the CrPC on starting a trial in a sessions case. Goswami had urged the court to quash the trial court’s order and directed the lower court’s judge to hear her discharge application. Justice Vora observed that asking the lower court to hear the discharge application first would not serve any purpose and the HC quashed the order. After quashing the order, the HC directed the trial court to start the trial in accordance with CrPC provisions. Panchal drew the attention of the court to the fact that some sessions courts in Gujarat follow the procedures laid down in Sections 226 to 228 of the CrPC at the beginning the trial and some just ignore this. On hearing this about the practice of directly framing charges in sessions cases, Justice Vora ordered the registry to circulate a copy of his order to all additional sessions judges and sessions judges of Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/high-court-remind-judges-of-crpc-provisions-/articleshow/81938597.cms||---

The AMC initiated action against three officers of the estate and town development office on Tuesday. A show-cause notice has also been issued by municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar to the three officers. The building is under construction and nearing completion. “There are chances that the flats have been sold to innocent buyers and may cause a huge financial loss to them,” said a senior AMC vigilance department official. The apartment complex is called Sanna-7 and is coming up in Rangwali Chali in Astodia’s Purabiawad. TOI has a copy of the show-cause notice issued on March 23. It is addressed to the assistant town development officer of the zone. The notice issued to the three officers states: “Complaints have been filed by some local residents with the city survey department and the district collector on the issue.” The plot size is approximately 2,435 square metres over which the 10-floor apartment complex is coming up in a very congested area. “The ward inspector and the head of the Jamalpur estate department have been called for questioning by municipal commissioner Kumar,” a senior AMC official said. This is not the first time that illegal apartments have sprung up in the Walled City. One such residential building in Saudagar ni Pol collapsed, killing five people and injuring 17 in 2011. “After the incident, the Central Zone had carried out a detailed survey of illegal residential buildings,” the official said. “The AMC is yet to initiate action against a majority of the 200-odd buildings that were identified as ‘illegal’ in 2011.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/three-amc-officers-face-action/articleshow/81939821.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Govt to talk to collectors on feedback from traders||MUMBAI: In the wake of complaints and suggestions received from opposition parties and protests by traders in various cities, the state government has decided to interact with all district collectors to get feedback from them on restrictions imposed across the state. State chief secretary Sitaram Kunte told TOI the state has planned a meeting with district collectors on Wednesday. “We will hear all the district collectors about responses and suggestions and then decide,” Kunte said. As per the state guidelines, all shops except essential services will be shut till April 30. As per the state, listed essential services include hospitals, diagnostic centres, clinics, medical insurance offices, pharmacies, pharmaceutical companies, other medical and health services also groceries, vegetable shops, dairies, bakeries, confectionaries, food shops etc. Asked about crowded local trains which could be one of the reasons for the second wave, Kunte said, “The state government has not touched public transport to avoid panic among people. During the first lockdown, there was chaos as people were stuck away from their homes for months. So instead of restricting commute, we have planned in such a way that public transport should not get crowded.” Sneha Patil, a resident of Ghatkopar, questioned the definition of non-essential shops. “What does one do if a senior citizen breaks his reading glasses? Even stationery shops are shut. What does one do if you need to photocopy a paper for some bank-related work? The definition of shops falling under the essential category needs to be broadened.” Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis, MNS chief Raj Thackeray and AAP have demanded that some relaxations should be given to shops. Fadnavis said the state should consider the state’s economy and livelihood of small traders, while Raj suggested to CM Uddhav Thackeray that some shops should be given relaxations at least for 2-3 days in a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-govt-to-talk-to-collectors-on-feedback-from-traders/articleshow/81939994.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

The committee had last week decided to call fresh applications for the post. The term of the VC has now been set for five years instead of earlier three-year period, said sources close to the matter. Earlier this year, the University Grants Commission (UGC) had rejected the appointment of Rajendra Khimani, former registrar of Gujarat Vidyapith as the new vice-chancellor of the varsity. The commission was of the view that his appointment was made without any representative of UGC in the search committee formed by Gujarat Vidyapith. tnn Following this, UGC appointed Navin Sheth, vice-chancellor of Gujarat Technological University (GTU) as member of a search committee to appoint the new vice-chancellor of the Gujarat Vidyapith, founded by Mahatma Gandhi in 1920. The term of outgoing VC Anamik Shah was also earlier extended till the new vice-chancellor is appointed and takes charge.

There’s no way to excuse what was done. The chief minister is taking it seriously,” Cabral said. To the contractor’s defence that neither the electricity department nor the PWD provided them with any maps of blueprints of the cable locations, Cabral said the cable has been dug out and is presently exposed and hard to miss. He added that the department has been trying to cooperate with the contractor asking it to inform the department when they take up work, but in vain. A department engineer said staff physically showed the workers the location of the underground high tension power cables on the ground. “What is the use of maps. We showed them physically where the cables are”. Cabral said the department has put a linesman on the job to ensure there is no further damage to their power cables. The electricity department, PWD and the contractor will sit together and work towards laying new cables, Cabral said. “After the highway widening work, our cables have landed in the middle of the road and will soon be under the concrete road and we won’t be able to attend to any faults if the need arises. New cables will soon be laid by the side of the road,” a department engineer said. “An estimate is already finalised and sanctioned, but the area is not acquired by PWD yet and that’s why this is stuck. Once there is a right of way, the new cables will be laid and there will be fewer problems,” the engineer said. The two high tension 33 kv cables were found punctured in 11 locations by the contractor during their work last weekend at Karaswada, inconveniencing people in Bardez who went for several hours without supply and many with intermittent power supply for 36 hours. “When the contractor has punctured one of the two cables in the past, people don’t notice it as we divert power to them. But this time it was a difficult situation as both the cables were punctured at the same time,” the engineer said. The high tension cables supply power from Tivim sub station to substations in Porvorim, Saligao, Mapusa, Candolim and Anjuna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cabral-staff-physically-showed-power-cables-to-contractor/articleshow/81939834.cms||---

The accused managed to flee from the spot, the police said. The medical report said that the girl was raped unnaturally. Notably, the police officials said that the accused is also a minor. According to police, it was alleged that on Tuesday night the victim was playing outside her house in Rudrapur. Her mother called her for dinner but she did not respond. The kin started looking for her and came to know that she was lured with a chocolate by her neighbour. The family members rushed to his house and found the girl on the roof who was bleeding profusely. The accused fled as soon as the victim's kin reached the spot. They informed the police and sent the girl for medical examination. A case was registered under section 376 (rape) of the IPC and POCSO Act on a complaint by the victim’s father. Circle officer Amit Kumar said, “The girl is critical. We have constituted teams to nab the accused.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/girl-11-raped-by-minor-in-us-nagar-critical/articleshow/81937685.cms||Aakash Ahuja

---||Goa||Move to oust me was fallout of not obeying Cabral, says new Curchorem chairperson||MARGAO: Following the rejection of the no-confidence motion moved by 10-councillors of the Curchorem Cacora Municipal Council (CCMC) by the directorate of municipal administration (DMA), detractors of Curchorem MLA Nilesh Cabral within the civic body are obviously delighted. However, with suspense still continuing over the identity of the three break-away councillors from the Cabral-camp who signed the motion, the celebration was, nevertheless, muted. CCMC chairperson, Balkrishna Hodarkar, speaking to reporters, while thanking the DMA for “upholding the law”, also termed the move as “the victory of truth.” He also said that his move of standing up to Cabral during his short stint as chairperson during the last term led to the current episode, leading to the controversial no-confidence motion moved against him. Hodarkar pointed out how he as chairperson had steadfastly refused to approve the handing over the management of a gymanasium at Cariamoddi, Curchorem, constructed in an open space through municipal funds, to a private agency without inviting tenders. Hodarkar will now chair the first meeting of the council on Wednesday. Among the items listed on the agenda are elections to the statutory standing committees of the council, and the approval to be granted for the annual financial budget of the council. On April 1, Hodarkar was elected CCMC chairperson, eight votes against seven, by a secret ballot, defeating Vishwas Sawant, the candidate backed by Cabral. However, he had to face the prospects of a no-confidence motion being moved against him by 10 of his fellow councillors within minutes of his election. On Monday, director of municipal administration, Gurudas Pilarnekar, refused to consider the motion “at this stage” on the grounds that their notice was received by his office even before the report of the proceedings of the election held to elect the chairperson and deputy chairperson could reach him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/move-to-oust-me-was-fallout-of-not-obeying-cabral-says-new-curchorem-chairperson/articleshow/81939872.cms||---
---||Goa||Massive spike but Goa CM says no decision on additional curbs||PANAJI: On a day Goa recorded its highest Covid-19 cases in almost six months, chief minister Pramod Sawant chaired a disaster management committee on Tuesday and said “the government has not taken any decision” on any additional measures to control the spread of the virus. He told people not to attend large gatherings and political meetings. “In an open space, the gathering should be fewer than 200 persons and people should only invite around 100 people for their weddings,” he said. But Sawant also said that Section 144, which prohibits the gathering of more than four persons in a public area, has been withdrawn. The government has also declined to put curbs on those entering the state. “It is not only tourists who are bringing Covid into the state, Covid is already there in the state,” Sawant said. Instead, he said: “People should take care and ensure that they do not mingle with the tourists.” Sawant also threatened that the government “would strictly impose fines on violators” who fail to wear masks—Rs 200—and maintain physical distancing. “Masks are compulsory for tourists and the public too,” he said. A year after the pandemic began and dominated public discourse, Sawant said he would ask police and collectors to “create awareness”. On a day TOI reported that patients were stranded on trolley stretchers due to the unavailability of beds, Sawant said “people who have Covid symptoms must get admitted”. He said that entire families are testing Covid-positive. “Beds at Goa Medical College, South Goa district hospital and ESI hospital are full. We have once again activated the Covid care centre at Fatorda stadium, ESI hospital and Shyama Prasad Mukherjee stadium,” he said. Sawant also said “no decision has been taken” on the issue of night curfew in the state. Without specifying what additional measures the government is taking to tackle the spike, Sawant claimed that “if the public cooperates with the government, it will help control the spread of Covid”. The government will also issue an advisory to the government employees above 45 years of age to take vaccine, and to ask the industrial and tourism sector to advise their employees, too, to get the jab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/massive-spike-but-cm-says-no-decision-on-additional-curbs/articleshow/81941168.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Coimbatore||Dist records 68.32 % voter turnout||Coimbatore recorded a voter turnout of 68.32 %, which was marginally higher than the previous assembly elections, on Tuesday. However, the turnout was lower than many other districts in the state. According to election officials, 21 lakh of the total 30 lakh voters spread across the 10 assembly constituencies in the district exercised their right to franchise on the day. Unlike the 2016 election, female voters outnumbered their male counterparts this time. Pollachi assembly segment recorded the highest voter turnout of 77.28 %, followed by Sulur and Mettupalayam. Coimbatore North had the lowest voter turnout of 59.08%. In the 2016 elections too, it was Pollachi that recorded the highest turnout, while Singanallur was placed at the bottom of the list. This time, Singanallur moved up the ladder but only with a marginal increase in the voter turnout. Polling data showed that there was a clear rural-urban divide, when it came to polling. Rural segments of Pollachi, Sulur, Mettupalayam, Valparai and Thondamuthur recorded above 70% polling, while urban segments of Singanallur (61.68%), Combatore South (60.08%), Coimbatore North (59.08%) recorded lower voter turnout. Kavundampalayam, a constituency with rural and urban areas, also recorded lower voter turnout, compared to fully rural segments. “There could be minor revisions in the data after the final compilation of voting data,” said an election officer. Unlike the past, when electronic voting machines (EVMs) used to develop technical glitches in the beginning of the poll, there were no such complaints this time. Public said the poll officials had made proper arrangements, taking the Covid-19 situation in account. “We were made to sanitize hands and disposable glove was given to us to use the EVM. We were able to vote without any hassles,” said a J Saravanakumari, at a polling station at Singanallur. Polling started in a brisk pace right from 7am and progressed in a smooth manner through the day, with social distancing in place. By 1pm, the district recorded a voter turnout of 39.5%, which rose to 51.7% by 3pm. After a lull in the afternoon, people started visiting the booths again in the evening. By 5pm, 61% voters in the district exercised their franchise. “After 6pm, most of the booths were empty,” said a district election officer. By 7pm, the officials ended the exercise and started packing the EVMs. The voting machines were sealed, packed and taken to the strong room at the Government College of Technology. “The EVMs from rural areas came a bit late. Those from Valparai would take three to four hours to reach the strong room,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dist-records-68-32-voter-turnout/articleshow/81939982.cms||Mayilvaganan

Allegations that the French anti-corruption agency Agence Francaise Anticorruption (AFA) had raised red flags over the deal prompted Congress to also look into the leaked audio tape where health minister Vishwajit Rane purportedly told another person that files pertaining to the deal were in Parrikar’s custody in Goa. “It is now pertinent to investigate the role of former defence minister late Manohar Parrikar, especially in context to the audiotape leak of health minister Vishwajit Rane,” said state Congress president Girish Chodankar. The French investigative agency had raised concerns when it found that after signing of the Rafale deal in 2016, Dassault paid 1.1 million euro to a middleman and Defsys Solutions. Chodankar said that Parrikar always appeared uncomfortable in replying to questions pertaining to the Rafale contract.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-probe-parrikars-role-in-rafale-deal/articleshow/81939911.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Goa sees 387 cases, highest tally in 6 months||PANAJI: The state recorded 387 fresh Covid-19 infections on Tuesday, taking the active tally to 2,471. The positivity rate, at 14%, continues to be among the highest in the country. With one more death, the pandemic’s toll in the state rose to 839. While the level of escalation show some resemblance to the first wave in August 2020, what has left doctors worried is the rapid pace of the virus this time. “On Monday, we had under 250 fresh cases, but today, we have 387,” said a senior doctor who declined to be named. “What we are seeing today is an exponential growth of Covid-19, which has overwhelmed the health infrastructure.” But state epidemioloist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar said that the graph is the same as the first wave of the pandemic, and that mortalities are less. The senior doctor, however, said the time taken by the state to cross the 300-case-mark is far shorter. “The numbers speak for themselves,” he said. “The situation along the Candolim-Calangute belt and Porvorim is spiralling out of control,” he said. “We are fighting an unknown enemy blindfolded. Nobody knows what type of strains are in circulation in the state, and what are its features,” he said. The doctor said that when cases started dropping in November 2020, it was due to the natural rise and fall of the epidemic. “The problem, however, is the speed at which is spreading. When we again started seeing a slow rise in cases from earlier this year, no restrictions were introduced,” he said. The result of 15 samples sent by the directorate of health services to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, for genome sequencing last month is still awaited. The state government is exploring the possibility of setting up a facility for genome testing here. On Tuesday, Porvorim’s caseload jumped to 190, while Candolim crossed the 200-mark. Panaji had 248 active cases and Ponda, which has seen rapid growth, had 192 cases. “All these areas have a high concentration of the population as compared to smaller towns in the state,” the doctor said. “They saw a lot of festivities, parties, high-profile weddings which proved super-spreaders, Carnival celebrations, supposedly low-profile Shigmo festivities, high tourist footfalls, election campaigns, and subsequent victory celebrations without Covid protocol being followed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-sees-387-cases-highest-tally-in-6-months/articleshow/81941175.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Experts suggest remdesivir for home-isolated patients||PUNE: Medical experts have now suggested use of remdesivir in eligible home-isolated Covid patients, who are not admitted to hospitals. Currently, the drug is given only to those hospitalised with Covid. At a recent meeting with the Pune Covid task force and PMC health officials, members of the Indian Medical Association said remdesivir can be given to carefully selected home-isolated patients on an OPD basis, either at clinics or hospitals. The IMA suggestion has a significant basis as a large chunk of new Covid patients have opted for home isolation (Pune district has at least 60,000 people recovering at home). If some of these patients experience drops in blood oxygen levels, they’ll have to seek out hospital beds to get remdesivir. “Giving remdesivir on an OPD basis is medically termed as ambulatory day-care administration. This is quite prevalent in western countries. If allowed, this will cut down hospitalization and reduce the burden on hospitals,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) Hospital Board of India (HBI). In the OPD administration of remdesivir, a home-isolated patient who is not hypoxic (low blood oxygen saturation), but has inducible hypoxia (after a three-minute or six-minute walk test) and whose chest CT score is 7 (or slightly above) with pre-existing health conditions is given the drug via drip at hospitals or clinics without being admitted. The patient is then allowed to return home after the intravenous drug transfusion is over and called back to the hospital or clinic the next day for another dose. Critical care experts in the city, however, urged caution. “If given in haste, without following protocol, the drug may cause complications. Remdesivir needs to be given under strict medical supervision and requires monitoring of a patient’s blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation in blood,” said Ruby Hall clinic chief intensivist Kapil Zirpe. Sanjeev Wavare, PMC’s nodal officer for Covid-19 said, “The suggestion is currently under consideration.” Officials said Pune district has enough remdesivir in its reserves. “The district’s current daily requirement is 7,000 to 8,000 vials, comparable to the demand during September. The supply will increase in the next few days,” said SB Patil, joint commissioner (drugs) of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-suggest-remdesivir-for-home-isolated-patients/articleshow/81938650.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Meanwhile, Akola, Yavatmal, Buldhana, and Washim, all in Amravati division, along with Nagpur Rural and the city’s Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), have enough stock to last only one more day. They will stop vaccinating recipients from Thursday. Stating this, a state official said the Centre is not replenishing vaccine stock continuously. Officials from Gondia district told TOIthat the district had to reduce the number of centres from 104 to 80 on Monday due to shortage of doses. “On Tuesday, we operated only 10 centres and managed to vaccinate 1,318 as against more than 4,000 on the previous two days,” they said. Gondia has been using Covishield since January 16 when the vaccination programme started. Officials of Amravati division said the four districts have neither Covishield nor Covaxin in the store rooms. Similarly, the Nagpur zilla parishad store room was emptied on April 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/maharashtra-districts-run-out-of-covid-19-vaccine-may-have-to-stop-drive/articleshow/81942364.cms||---

The case wasn’t any different for the residents of Thuvaipathy and Kallukadu tribal settlements on Tamil Nadu-Kerala border - they trudged nearly 3km to reach the polling station that was housed at the government residential primary school for tribals at Anaikatti to cast their votes. More than 15 tribal settlements, including Sankarankudi, Kallarkudi, Sincona, Udumpanparai, Kavarkal, Paramankudi, Sheikal Mudi and Vellimudi, are located at least 15km to 20 km away from Valparai town and most of them lack proper roads. There are around 40 tribal families living at Sankarankudi and the voters from the settlement had to walk all the way to the polling booth with the help of bamboo sticks on the day. The residents of Sankarankudi settlement too trudged through the dense forest, where the movement of leopards and elephants are common, to vote. The return journey was also cumbersome. Balamani, 50, a resident of Veerapandi village panchayat and her husband Maruthan, 53, said while the AIADMK and the DMK had arranged autos and jeeps to ferry the tribal voters to the polling station, they opted to walk from their Thuvaipathi tribal settlement. However, Maruthi, 80 and her husband Karatti, 87, also from Thuvaipathy tribal settlement, availed the auto facility. They exercised their franchise at the government tribal residential primary school at Anaikatti. After voting, they sat near the polling station. Maruthi also sang a song. Border Security Force personnel were deployed at the polling station at Anaikatti, which is located on TN-Kerala border, as Kerala side used to report Maoist threats often. The major Dravidian parties had also arranged food for the tribal voters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tribals-trek-through-dense-forest-to-cast-vote/articleshow/81940100.cms||A Subburaj

Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has already converted 23 schools into vaccination sites. PMC officials said the civic body is finalising the schools, where vaccination sites can be opened. Schools that are in the vicinity of municipal hospitals will be selected so that, in case of any adverse effect post vaccination, the beneficiary can be shifted to the hospitals. 30 schools are likely to be roped in for vaccination. “We appeal to citizens to take benefit of this facility. More and more people should take the shot,” said Vaishali Jadhav, a senior PMC official. According to civic officials, the premises, where vaccination has to be done, must have at least three rooms to be used for vaccination, a waiting room, and an observation room. “Currently, the vaccination sites are located at hospitals as treatment can be given if required post-vaccination,” said a senior PMC official. As per PMC data, 140 school buildings are available in its jurisdiction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/civic-schools-to-be-used-as-vaccination-centres/articleshow/81938698.cms||---
---||Pune||Vaccine shortage at rural sites in Pune slows coverage pace||PUNE: Vaccination coverage in the district saw a drop on Tuesday with just over 50,000 people vaccinated across more than 500 sites. On Monday, there were well over 85,000 beneficiaries in the region. Officials said the slump was caused by a shortage of vaccines at several rural centres. Ayush Prasad, the CEO of Pune zilla parishad said, “Many rural centres ran out of vaccines on Tuesday. The reserves are being replenished.” There were no reports of shortages from the urban centres in the district. In terms of overall coverage, over 5,000 senior citizens and people over 45 with underlying conditions have now been given their second doses in the district. So far, more than six lakh elderly and those above 45 (with and without serious ailments) have received their first doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. The Centre on March 22 had asked all states to increase the interval between two Covishield shots from the earlier 4-6 weeks to 4-8 weeks. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, “Ideally, the second dose should be given to eligible beneficiaries between the 6th and 8th week after the first dose. It improves vaccine protection. And while there is no change in intervals for Covaxin (4 weeks), recipients of this vaccine can still go ahead and get their second dose after four weeks.” Deshmukh added the second dose delay gives the health department a bit more time to cover more first-time beneficiaries. On Tuesday, overall vaccinations figures in the district included 23,799 beneficiaries across Pune rural sites, 19,558 in PMC limits and another 10,011 vaccinations in PCMC areas. Deshmukh said Tuesday’s drop in coverage does not mean the district is no longer aiming for one lakh daily vaccinations. “We are quite sure the numbers will rise again on Wednesday and Thursday.” He said supply of doses will continue to all parts of Pune district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vaccine-shortage-at-rural-sites-slows-coverage-pace/articleshow/81938669.cms||Piyush Bhusari

IndiGo confirmed that it was facing an employee unrest and said that some of their demands are being met. Ground staff employed on contract basis by IndiGo’s subsidiary, Agile, started protesting outside the airport terminal and demanded a hike in wages and removal of the station manager. “A small section of them in Goa have caused disruption at work, asking for an immediate increment, while it has been promised to be included in the salary for April 2021,” IndiGo said in a statement. Airport officials said that while no flights were cancelled, around three were delayed by 30 to 45 minutes. While expressing regret over the inconvenience caused to passengers, IndiGo also took steps to bring in additional staff to ensure that baggage was loaded onto aircraft. The protesting workers said that they had not received any increments for the last three years even though the cost of living has increased. The workers are also upset about the disparity in wages. “The contract workers have been getting Rs 10,000 as a monthly salary. The old staff is getting Rs 13,800, but we are all on contract and do the same work. We won’t report back on duty till our demands are met,” a baggage loader said. IndiGo has said that staff from other divisions will be brought in to ensure that flight operations are not affected. The contract workers also said that they are not given necessary kits such as uniform, shoes and jackets on time. “One of our core principles is taking care of all employees working for IndiGo. Employees of Agile, a 100% subsidiary company of IndiGo, have always received their salaries on time. We have not had any terminations even during the pandemic over the last one year,” IndiGo said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/indigo-flights-delayed-as-loaders-go-on-flash-strike/articleshow/81939964.cms||---

On Tuesday, the monkeys at the zoo were seen enjoying watermelons and musk melons as air coolers warded off the heat.  R K Sahoo, the Kankaria zoo superintendent, said: “Apart from the coolers, nursery green nets have also been fitted around the cages.” He added: “These nets bring down the temperature by almost 8 degrees.” Once the temperature rises to 42°C, the zoo authorities will start giving the animals anti-stress medicines mixed in water.  Sahoo said that the greenery in the zoo keeps the temperature 4-5 degrees lower than the temperature outside. Zoo officials said it is being ensured that the ponds in tiger, hippopotamus, and crocodile enclosures are full. Also, the crocodiles’ preference for marshy areas is being borne in mind. The officials said that water will be sprinkled on hippopotamuses. The officials said that almost every enclosure has a cooler. They said that young and older animals need special care during summer months. “We keep a close watch on their diet to detect the signs of any kind of distress,” an official said. “Ample water has been provided to animals such as hippopotamuses to maintain their body temperature.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mercury-rises-zoo-animals-get-air-coolers/articleshow/81940073.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

Expressing apprehensions, the MP said: “Since all the witnesses cited by the prosecution in the quid pro quo case are now subjects of Jagan, he will influence them not to depose against him.” He attributed the prevalence of fear psychosis in the society due to the high-handed approach of the CM and his party leaders who, he alleged, were intolerant of any criticism of the party and its leadership. He also raised the alleged excessive use of police force to suppress dissenting voices in the state. The trial court is likely to take up the MP’s petition within a day or two. The MP said non-appearance by Jagan before the trial court and seeking exemptions were violative of bail conditions. Citing judgments of the Supreme Court, he said the plea for seeking cancellation of bail could be filed by aggrieved third parties also. “It is not correct to say that only the prosecution has to file such pleas,” he said. The YSRCP MP said that key posts were given to persons who were named as co-accused in the quid pro quo case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cancel-bail-given-to-jagan-ysrc-mp/articleshow/81938694.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Goa||States impose curbs, Goa hotels feel pinch||Panaji: Even as Goa refuses to impose curbs on tourism to curtail the spread of the virus, the restrictions ordered by Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi and Karnataka have had a cascading effect on the state’s tourism industry. Hotels have been seeing cancellation of bookings anywhere between 25% and 30%, while there’s a major slowdown in fresh bookings. The requests for cancellation of hotel bookings went up no sooner Maharashtra government, two days ago, imposed a complete weekend lockdown across the state, following a massive surge in Covid-19 cases. While Goa is considered a weekend gateway for the metro crowd of the country, about one-third of the domestic tourists come from various parts of Maharashtra,. “A lot of cancellations are happening due to the restrictions in other states. People are cancelling their travel plans as they fear that in the event of a lockdown, they may remain stranded here,” Varun Albuquerque, director of Alcon Victor Group, said. Few weddings and other events lined up for this month have been deferred to a future date. Tourism stakeholders opine that the industry will remain affected till end of the month or mid-May, or till Covid-19 cases don’t reduce drastically. “Over the last two weeks a lot of cancellations are coming in from groups as well as free independent travellers (FIT). Currently, there are no new bookings and we are in a bad state. April is looking very low for most hotels in South Goa,” said Guitry Velho, assistant vice-president and general manager, Heritage Village Club Goa. “We had some weddings and conferences lined up for this month, but they have been called off and deferred to a future date,” general manager of Zuri White Sands Goa Resort and Casino, Rajendra Menon, told TOI. While Goa’s tourism sector did well over the last six months, restrictions in other states owing to rise in coronavirus cases have led to confusion and panic in the market. Every state that matters to Goa’s tourism sector has some sort of travel restrictions imposed. “Maharashtra has weekend lockdowns and night curfews. All the source markets of Goa are seeing a big rise in Covid-19 cases. Naturally, there is panic in the market. Weddings are getting deferred, because even if the groom’s and bride’s families want to go ahead with the schedule, their invitees may not be willing,” said Menon. Velho is worried that new bookings may dip further in the days to come. However, on an optimistic note, Menon said the reversal of the situation may be seen by the end of the month or the first week of May, “provided there is a decline in cases”. “Obviously, there is no comparison to what happened during the corresponding period last year. Hopefully, the worst is behind us. The airlines are operating, road transport is open. The things are not as bad as last year but sentiments are badly affected, leading people to pause their travel plans,” Menon said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/states-impose-curbs-goa-hotels-feel-pinch/articleshow/81941180.cms||Bindiya Chari

While mining companies have filed a special leave petition (SLP) for resumption of mining in the state, the Goa government has filed a review petition against the February 2018 order of the apex court that had brought the entire industry to a halt in the state. During his budget speech last month, the chief minister had announced the setting of the corporation to auction leases. ‘The government will sign an MoU with the Mineral Exploration Corporation LTD (MECL)...and that will help the state government start the process for e-auction,” Sawant had said. In 2018, the Supreme Court had quashed the second renewal of 88 mining leases. Twenty-six village panchayats have approached the Supreme Court with an interlocutory application (IA) seeking impleadment in the Goa mining case. The mining companies had filed a special leave petition in the apex court after the high court of Bombay at Goa dismissed their petitions challenging the Goa, Daman and Diu (Abolition and Declaration of Mining Leases) Act, 1987. During the Portuguese rule, the appellants (mining companies) were granted mining concessions, which were then converted into mining leases under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, (MMDR Act). The SLP had stated that the act should be made applicable from 1987, instead of1961. The state government had also told the SC that the companies had made a representation to the mines department contending that under the amendment to Section 8A of the MMDR Act, they are entitled to extend their leases to 2037, but that they would abide by the court’s order. The state had said that from 1987 the mining concessions were converted into mining leases under the MMDR Act, and consequently the 50 mining leases would be extended to 2037. The chief minister had recently said that the both Centre and the state have started adopting measures to restart mining. Sawant had said that if the apex court agrees with the stand of the state government, then mining leases will be allowed to operate in the state till 2037.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/supreme-court-likely-to-hear-mining-matter-today/articleshow/81940024.cms||---

While shop owners kept their businesses open in Kolhapur on Tuesday, there was confusion in Aurangabad and Pune over the government order. On Monday, the representatives of the Kolhapur Chamber of Commerce and Industries (KCCI) had met the authorities and warned that they would not follow the order and said shops would stay open on weekdays. The traders said they would only keep their businesses shut on Saturdays and Sundays as part of the weekend restrictions. On Tuesday, the traders shut their shops by 3pm after Kolhapur district guardian minister Satej Patil assured them that a meeting with the district authorities would be called on Wednesday.Many shopkeepers and vendors in Pune and Aurangabad opened their businesses in the morning. In Pune, garment and hardware shops in Kothrud, retailers in the Laxmi Road area, footwear shops on MG Road and shops in Kondhwa remained open on Tuesday. Some shopkeepers said they were confused about whether the shutdown was to be implemented only on weekends or throughout the month. Ajay Shah, senior vice-president of the Chamber of Association of Maharashtra Industry and Trade, said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in his recent public address, did not give any hint of a blanket closure of commercial establishments. “The prohibitory orders issued by the district administration failed to reach the shopkeepers and owners of different commercial establishments on time,” he said. Meanwhile, the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (MACCIA) on Tuesday gave a 48-hour ultimatum to the state government to withdraw the order by 6pm on April 8. MACCIA president Santosh Mandlecha gave the ultimatum during an online meeting of representatives of different trade associations from Pune, Solapur, Kolhapur, Aurangabad, Nagpur, Gondia, Amravati and Mumbai. The resolution of the meeting is to be sent to Thackeray, deputy CM Ajit Pawar, chief secretary Sitaram Kunte and governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. “If the government fails to withdraw its order, traders across the state will go ahead and open their shops,” Mandlecha told TOI. He appealed to the state government to come out with a more logical order. Fatehchand Ranka, president of the Federation of Trade Association Pune, said: “TV news had created this confusion. But all that was cleared in a meeting that the members held on Monday. These shopkeepers, who kept their shops open on Tuesday, were probably new or non-members. Keeping their shops open is not an act of defiance, but of survival. We are not going to tell anyone to shut their shops, they are keeping them open on their own discretion. The association will not interfere if any action is taken against them.” Ranka said the entire business community is against the order to shut shops. They will be writing a letter to everyone, including the prime minister, chief minister, deputy chief minister, collector, commissioner, deputy commissioner, local MPs and MLAs, to review and reconsider the order. “After we send the letters, we will be meeting and deciding on what further action needs to be taken,” he said. Earlier, Mohan Gurnani, president of Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industry and Trade (CAMIT), said this was not a “chain breaking, but trade breaking” order. Rajendra Bhatiya, Maharashtra president of Confederation of All-India Traders, said the state has allowed e-commerce and home delivery of food, but has ordered closure of non-essential shops. Bhatiya said they may consider moving court against the state government on this issue. KCCI president Sanjay Shete said that the state government should either close all shops, or allow all to operate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/kolhapur-shops-stay-open-in-defiance-confusion-in-pune-aurangabad/articleshow/81940003.cms||---
---||World||EMA official sees clear 'association' between AstraZeneca vaccine and rare blood clots in brain||ROME: A senior official at Europe's medicines regulator has said there is a clear "association" between AstraZeneca's COvid-19 vaccine and very rare blood clots in the brain, though the direct cause of the clots is still unknown. The European Medical Agency (EMA) said in a statement after the comments by Marco Cavaleri, chair of its vaccine evaluation team, that it was still conducting a review of the vaccine and expected to announce its findings on Wednesday or Thursday. An AstraZeneca spokesman declined to comment on Cavaleri's remarks, which he made in an interview with Italian newspaper Il Messagero that was published on Tuesday. "In my opinion, we can now say it, it is clear that there is an association (of the brain blood clots) with the vaccine. However, we still do not know what causes this reaction," Cavaleri said, without giving evidence to support his comments. The EMA has said the benefits of the AstraZeneca shot outweigh any risks, and the World Health Organization has backed the vaccine. AstraZeneca has said previously that its studies have found no higher risk of clots because of its vaccine. The EMA is investigating 44 reports of an extremely rare brain clot known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) out of 9.2 million people who have received the vaccine in the European Economic Area, which comprises European Union member states and Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Cavaleri said the EMA would say in its review that there is a link, but was not likely to give an indication this week on which age groups should or should not get the AstraZeneca shot. Some countries, including France, Germany and the Netherlands, have suspended the use of the vaccine in younger people while the investigations continue. REVIEW ONGOINGIn response to Cavaleri's comments, the Amsterdam-based EMA said in a statement on Tuesday: "EMA’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) has not yet reached a conclusion and the review (of any possible link) is currently ongoing." The EMA said last week that its review had not identified any specific risk factors, such as age, gender or medical history, for these very rare events. In a separate interview, Armando Genazzani, a member of the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), told La Stampa daily that it was "plausible" that the blood clots were correlated with the AstraZeneca vaccine. A high proportion of the reported cases are in young or middle-aged women, but that has not led the EMA to conclude this group is at particular risk. Scientists are exploring several possibilities that might explain the rare brain blood clots. One theory suggests the vaccine triggers an unusual antibody in some rare cases; other investigators are looking into a possible link with birth control pills. But many experts say there is no definitive evidence and it is not clear whether or why AstraZeneca's vaccine would cause a problem not shared by other vaccines that target a similar part of the coronavirus. "We need to know more about the people affected and we need to understand exactly how the illnesses came about, while many other questions remain unanswered at this time," said Adam Finn, a professor of paediatrics at Britain's Bristol University who has been involved with UK studies of several Covid-19 vaccines, including the AstraZeneca shot and another developed by Pfizer. He said it was very clear that clotting cases were "very rare indeed" and that the vaccines that are available and in use in Britain "prevent Covid very effectively".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/ema-official-sees-clear-association-between-astrazeneca-vaccine-and-rare-blood-clots-in-brain/articleshow/81942217.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Bail denied to CGST officers in graft case||AHMEDABAD: A special anti-corruption court at Mirzapur on Tuesday turned down bail applications by two central goods and service tax (CGST) officers, who were allegedly nabbed taking Rs 1.5 lakh bribe by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) squad last month. Additional sessions judge J A Thakkar refused bail to joint commissioner Neetu Singh and superintendent Prakash Rasania with observation that the government is paying huge amount of salary to such type of officers, and their involvement in graft case cannot be taken liberally. After recording the arguments put forth by district government pleader Praveen Trivedi, the court said, “The tax amount is very essential for the government and the entire government system depends upon the such tax amount, which is used for the various scheme in helping the poor people of the country and at present in the situation like Covid-19, we witness how the government is utilizing the funds which comes from the collection of such type of taxes. Therefore, as this matter is connected with the revenue of the state, it can be said that, it is the public money and therefore, it is reason to believe that this offence is directly connected with public money and for this reason, it cannot be taken liberally.” ACB had received a complaint from Syga Home Furnishing after a notice was sent to ascertain difference between input tax credit vide GSTR-3B and credit vide GSTR-2A. The difference was Rs 1.56 crore, but Rs 5 lakh bribe was allegedly demanded by the accused for not finding any error and to close the file.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bail-denied-to-cgst-officers-in-graft-case/articleshow/81940102.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Threats fail to keep voters away at Kolkata doorstep||Bishnupur/Diamond Harbour: A woman going to cast her vote at Rambakhali Chowk village in Pailan—barely a few km from city’s southern suburbs—took her teen daughter along, unsure about her safety back home. Half way through, the mother-daughter duo was surrounded by armed goons. The two crawled in thick mud for 600m before reaching safety. n A widely circulated video showed a woman from Rambakhali, on her way to a booth, being stopped by a man. She, however, stood her ground and said she would not budge without casting her vote.  n At Canning East, Saokat Molla, a Trinamool leader staged a 45-minute demonstration, claiming the ISF-BJP combine had hurled bombs and planted explosives 50m from booths. n At Nopara Junior School in Basuldanga, Diamond Harbour, 30% polls were reportedly cast by 11am but TOI found only three to four voters outside booth. Polling officers claimed several agents had come “very late” but voting was hampered. Polling in the 16 constituencies in South 24 Parganas was crucial for Trinamool, which is keen on holding on to the district, which has been “theirs” since 2008. But for the opposition, it was their scope to show they were a credible alternative. Abbas Siddiqui-led ISF put up a dogged resistance in the two Canning constituencies, along with Magrahat. Trinamool insiders said the party was rethinking its strategy for Bhangar for April 10 polls. BJP strived to hold on to its pockets, especially at Mandirbazar, Diamond Harbour and Falta. The tension, however, could not deter the women from coming out in large numbers to cast their votes “We understand the importance of this poll. We should play a leading role in deciding its fate,” said Fatima Begum from Haldarhat, Diamond Harbour. Intimidations apparently started from Monday night, with both BJP and Trinamool candidates alleging threats to their polling agents and voters in Kuleshwar, Muruiberia and Basuldanga in Diamond Harbour and Kulerdari and Panakua in Bishnupur. Firing was reported from Hedia in Basanti. By morning, almost all parties lodged complaints of intimidation. BJP candidate and two-time MLA Dipak Halder said all their agents were threatened and voters were stopped. “Central forces did little as they were under orders from the state administration,” he claimed. Halder sat in a dharna at a Dhanerberia booth after he found his agent “missing”. He later tried to block the road at Singherberia. BJP has demanded re-polling in 11 Bishnupur booths. Trinamool claimed EVM malfunctioning and CAPF excesses, saying voters in Diamond Harbour, Bisnupur, Satgachhia, Kultali and Falta were harassed. “At Bishnupur, they allowed BJP leaders to roam freely in booths. At Falta, they threatened voters to go for BJP. We have approached the Election Commission with our complaints,” said Trinamool’s Purnendu Basu. At Raidight’s Lalpur, Trinamool accused BJP of distributing money coupons, worth Rs 1,000 each. The CPM blamed Trinamool and BJP for largescale “silent intimidation” by Trinamool and BJP in rural pockets of Diamond Harbour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/threats-fail-to-keep-voters-away-at-kolkata-doorstep/articleshow/81938796.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Forest officials noticed a tiffin box was buried and suspecting that it could be a land mine planted by Maoists, immediately alerted the village sarpanch, who in turn alerted the cops. “BD team scanned the area with metal detectors and then using a low intensity explosive, triggered a minor blast around the tiffin box,” Rajanna Sircilla SP Rahul Hegde said. “We suspect that someone who believes in black magic has buried the tiffin box,” the SP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tiffin-box-leads-to-bomb-squad-visit/articleshow/81938714.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Students of Class IX and XI may not have to take exams||MUMBAI: Students of Class IX and XI in the state may be promoted to the next grade without having to appear for examinations, said an education department official on Tuesday. The official said a decision would be taken in a day or two. Earlier in the day, school education minister Varsha Gaikwad met officials from the education department to discuss the matter. The official said the state could not conduct online board exams for Class X and XII as infrastructure for it was lacking. “Even if the state decides to conduct the board exams online, every student will have to go to school to appear for the exams using the school computer, as is the case with competitive exams. The department will have to make those many computers available for every student. Network issues may create problems in many rural areas. These practical issues should be taken into consideration while parents demand online exams,” the official said. Over the day, students and parents took to Twitter to demand cancellation of the Class X and XII board exams. By evening, over four lakh tweets had used the hashtag #cancelboardexams2021. “Students, parents, and teachers are very worried about the risk that the pandemic poses. The best way ahead is to promote students up to Class XI and conduct online exams for Class XII or evaluate them on the basis of internal assessment, assignment, orals,” a parent, Anubha Sahai, said. Another group of parents argued that delaying or cancelling board exams would have an impact on students’ careers. “A lot of career opportunities depend on a student’s Class XII marks. It wouldn’t be right to not give students a fair chance. The state must focus on implementing strict SOPs to ensure safety. Once the board exams are over in time, the students can focus on other competitive exams,” a parent said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-students-of-class-ix-and-xi-may-not-have-to-take-exams/articleshow/81943775.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

---||Delhi||FCI not buying wheat in Delhi: Rai||New Delhi: Agriculture minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday alleged that the Centre’s Food Corporation of India (FCI) has not set up a single counter for wheat procurement in Delhi and is making false claims of buying the crop at minimum support price (MSP) rates from April 1. The Union consumer affairs, food and public distribution ministry, however, called the allegation baseless. Rai said Delhi government had written thrice, but FCI had not opened any counter yet and the farmers were being forced to sell their wheat to stockholders at different rates. The Centre is responsible for fixing MSP of crops and FCI for making purchases, but BJP is falsely accusing Delhi government of not buying wheat on MSP rates, he added. This is why it is important to make MSP a legal guarantee, Rai said, and demanded that the Centre convenes immediate purchase at MSP rates in Najafgarh and Narela mandis. Stringent action should be taken against those claiming that the counters have been set up in these mandis from April 1, he said. “It’s been a long while since the farmers have been fighting to get MSP as a legal guarantee in farming,” he said. Rai said a very small area of land is facilitated for farming in Delhi, including areas like Narela, Bawana, Mundka, Najafgarh and Mehrauli. “In such areas, ripening of wheat has been done and harvest season has commenced. However, in spite of repeatedly requesting FCI, they are not ready to purchase the crops at MSP-designated rates and set up their own counters,” he claimed. The Union ministry said, “The contentions of Delhi government are not true that FCI has not opened any purchase centre in Delhi. In fact, FCI Delhi region is fully prepared to procure wheat from farmers of Delhi at three centres — FSD Mayapuri, FSD Narela and APMC Najafgarh Mandi — which have been completely operational from April 1. Till date, 158 quintal wheat has been purchased at FSD Narela.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fci-not-buying-wheat-in-delhi-rai/articleshow/81958697.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Though such a waiting period is not affecting travellers much, the worst sufferers are people with Covid-19 symptoms and opting for doorstep swab sample collection. Laboratory officials said they were overwhelmed with the number of tests and facing a dearth of trained manpower for the job. Kalyaninagar resident Rupali Dawat had been trying to reach out on the helpline numbers of a laboratory to book an appointment for the doorstep collection of her brother’s swab samples. “The call centre numbers are either busy, or the recorded message states that there is a massive traffic for booking appointments. On Tuesday, I finally got an appointment for Friday.” Baner residents Ashwini Doke said, “I contacted a lab on Tuesday and the lady representative, who received the call, initially insisted upon me visiting the facility on the grounds that they did not have adequate staffers for home visits and their slots were full till Thursday. I finally got an appointment for Friday morning. I was not much in a hurry because I will travel by air from the city on Sunday or Monday.” Wanowrie resident Sachin Khaitan said, “My wife and I had a cough and body ache on Monday and decided to book a test at home. When we contacted a laboratory, an executive said we can get a slot two days later. We visited the laboratory on Monday itself because we did not want to delay the test.” Abhishek Kumbhar, a lab executive collecting samples in the Kalyaninagar area, said, “I alone collect 50-60 samples a day from homes. My phone does not stop ringing throughout the day. I get calls at midnight from some frantic citizens for doorstep sample collection.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/2-day-waiting-period-for-doorstep-swab-collection-baffles-citizens/articleshow/81938715.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: It’s a trade-breaking, not a chain-breaking order, says Assn||MUMBAI/PUNE/NAGPUR/KOLHAPUR: Traders across the state protested against the shutting of shops and establishments during the week. Shop-owners in Kolhapur kept their businesses open on Tuesday, while traders in parts of Nagpur staged protests. In Pune, shops in parts of Kothrud, Laxmi Road, MG Road and Kondhwa remained open despite the state order. In Aurangabad, many shopkeepers and vendors opened their businesses on Tuesday morning. CAMIT (Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industry and Trade) warned that traders would launch an “aggravated statewide agitation” from Thursday if the state did not end the “illogical lockdown” by then. “If the government fails to withdraw its order, traders across the state will go ahead and open their shops,” MACCIA president Santosh Mandlecha told TOI. Mohan Gurnani, president of CAMIT said this was not a “chain-breaking but trade-breaking” order. The Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI) said 90% of restaurants in the state will be forced to shut down due to the latest ‘Break the Chain’ guidelines. Maharashtra has 10,500 hotels and 2.10 lakh restaurants. “Already small and medium(-sized) hotels and eateries are in deep financial trouble. Without government support, the industry is staring at disaster,” the association stated. Poultry farmers and breeders urged the CM to permit egg and chicken shops to function. Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis of BJP wrote to the CM alerting him to the public unrest, saying small shopkeepers, traders and retailers had not been taken into confidence. Fadnavis said he had been informed of lockdown only on the weekends, to which he had agreed, but the rigid lockdown restrictions during the week had led to anger and in several places people had come out on the streets. The Aam Aadmi Party also appealed to Thackeray to withdraw the order. Rajendra Bhatiya, Maharashtra president of Confederation of All-India Traders, said the state has allowed e-commerce and home delivery of food but ordered closure of non-essential shops. Bhatiya said they may consider moving court against the state government. Jeweller Raichand Jain, president of Lokhandwala Vyapari Mandal, said, “On what basis do we say what is essential and what is not? If marriages are allowed, sarees and jewellery are essential for that family.” Ankit Jain of the Borivli East Vyapari Association said, “Trains, buses, markets and hawkers are a far worse pandemic risk than organised businesses which implement safety norms. How will we feed our families and support our workers?” In Girgaum, Tanaji Malusare, who runs a computer maintenance shop, said, “We service computers of hospitals and private offices, so shutting down is not feasible.” Tea vendor Jeetendra Ghadge of Opera House said this was a “complete lockdown” in his view. Bandra corporator Asif Zakaria said police made shops close on Linking Road and Hill Road. At Lamington Road, the hub of electronics and computer hardware, dejected traders lined up outside their shuttered shops. Kolhapur Chamber of Commerce and Industries president Sanjay Shete said the state should either close all shops or allow all to operate. Kolhapur district guardian minister Satej Patil requested traders to shut shops after assuring them a meeting with district authorities will be called on Wednesday. Viren Shah of retailers’ association FRTWA said confusion reigned as they realised the lockdown for non-essential shops was complete. In Seawoods, Navi Mumbai, protesters said it was with difficulty they went through the lockdown last year, so another lockdown would break their backs. In Vasai-Virar, huge crowds were visible outside wine shops and vegetable markets and grocery shops were bustling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-its-a-trade-breaking-not-a-chain-breaking-order-says-assn/articleshow/81940106.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Covid patients paying through nose to purchase branded Remdesivir||Nagpur: Concerns are being expressed over the exorbitant maximum retail price (MRP) on Remdesivir brands, including one which is 440% higher than the rate offered to the retailer, distributor and private hospital. This is leading to Covid patients being fleeced by the managements of Covid hospitals. The MRP is also 429% higher than the price being offered to government hospitals by the pharmaceutical company. Insiders attribute the rumours of black-marketing to the excessively high MRP of the Remdesivir injection, which is in high demand while supply is scarce. Though it’s learnt that tough competition among pharmaceutical companies has forced them to bring down the Remdesivir price, they continue to trade with the old MRP. This is leading to different rates being offered in the market for the injection. In the backdrop of the crisis, buyers are ready to pay any amount to save a life, without caring for the brand available at the time of need. A top official source showed how a leading pharmaceutical company’s MRP is 468% higher than what it is offering to the retailer and 440% higher to the distributor’s price. The brand’s MRP is also 440% higher than the rate it is offering to the government and private hospitals. A popular brand in the city has MRP 291% higher than the rate the pharmaceutical company offers to retailers, 348% higher than the distributor, 370% more than what is offered to private hospitals and 395% more than the rate it is offering to government hospitals. Only two brands have reduced their prices publicly to Rs899 and Rs577 excluding taxes following appeals by the FDA. The issue has triggered major controversy now with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorities requesting the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) to bring ‘uniformity’ in the price of Remdesivir. Hetal Thakkar of Nagpur District Chemist and Druggist Association, said Remdesivir injections should be now included in the essential commodities list, like it was done for sanitizers in the past. Trying to exclude it from the purview of the Drug Price Control Order would take longer time. “Due to competition, the top pharmaceutical companies have reduced the price to between Rs1,400-2,000 but it fluctuates,”said Thakkar. Dr Anup Marar, convenor of Vidarbha Hospitals Association, said the rate difference between companies selling Remdesivir with diverse margins is alarming. “We are not sure why government cannot cap the price of these injections as it is doing unconstitutionally for hospital rates. This will remove the gross disparity and will not further antagonise the public, who blame this rate difference on medical fraternity for no fault of theirs,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-patients-paying-through-nose-to-purchase-branded-remdesivir/articleshow/81938747.cms||Soumitra Bose

Three districts from the region — Beed (0.96%), Latur (0.71%) and Osmanabad (0.56%) — have been showing mortality rate of less than 1%, official data available with the Aurangabad divisional commissionerate shows. Terming the significant drop in death rate as morale-booster in fight against Covid-19, health authorities said that the growing awareness about the pandemic as well as evolved treatment protocols and healthcare facilities have reduced the causalities. “Despite record rise in fresh cases across the region in the last few weeks, the death rate is lower as compared to last year which is a notable achievement. The increased surveillance and awareness among all stakeholders, including public at large, is the reason behind an effective check on deaths due to Covid-19 during the second wave of the pandemic,” deputy director of health for Aurangabad region Dr. Swapnil Lale said. The progressive death rate among Covid patients in Marathwada by the end of the last year was 2.97% which has come down to 1.19% at present. Lale said that the three-tier healthcare system in the form of Covid Care Centres, Dedicated Covid Health Centres and Dedicated Covid Hospitals has undergone revamp to deal with the second-wave of the pandemic. “The healthcare system is being equipped with adequate number of oxygen beds and ventilators in keeping with the rise in patients. The expertise and surveillance of health staff and doctors have reached to a new height by virtue of experience in Covid care of last year,” he said. Among other five districts, Parbhani currently has highest death rate (1.55%) , followed by Aurangabad (1.34%), Nanded (1.31%), Hingoli (1.26%) and Jalna (1.07%).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/lesser-death-rate-in-marathwada-during-2nd-wave/articleshow/81936980.cms||Prasad Joshi

Haresh Thakor, who runs a mobile phone repair shop in Kalol and lives at Khuniyavas of Santej village, said he has filed various RTI applications seeking details of expenditure on development in his village. He said his cousin Khodaji Thakor, the sarpanch of the village, was not happy with his RTI pleas and threatened him not to file more applications. He said Khodaji had on December 24, 2020, parked a vehicle in front of his house and when Haresh asked him on why he parked his vehicle in front of his house, Khodaji began abusing him. Haresh said Khodaji began asking him why he was harassing him by filing RTI applications and threatened to kill him. When Haresh protested, Khodaji began thrashing him and shot a video which he later published on social media. On January 3, Khodaji, with his wife, Chanchi Thakor, and three aides — Govindji Thakor, Karan Thakor and Ajay Thakor — attacked him with sticks and pipes, leaving him severely injured. Haresh alleged that the accused broke his mobile phone, and thrashed his wife and broke her phone when she tried to rescue him. He stated in the FIR that he did not file a complaint against Khodaji and the others as he was scared of the accused persons. He approached Santej police on Sunday and filed a complaint for causing hurt, criminal intimidation and use of abusive words against Khodaji and the four others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-makes-rti-inquiry-about-panchayat-work-assaulted/articleshow/81938768.cms||---

According to Anandnagar police, the incident took place when she was alone in the servant room of the house. The accused allegedly thrashed and raped her. After the incident, he fled from there and the woman told her family members about the incident and later informed her employers. She approached Anandnagar police on Monday and filed a complaint of rape against the accused. Inspector A S Roy of Anandnagar police said, “We cannot reveal the accused’s identity as he would come to know through media reports that an FIR has been registered against him and it would then be difficult to catch him.” “In past also, we could not nab accused in sensitive cases just because the accused’s name was revealed in media reports,” he added. On a query about the victim’s employer, he remained tightlipped. He said that the victim has been sent for medical examination and the cops are trying to nab the accused.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast an “increase in cloud formation” from April 8 onwards following which light rainfall or thundershowers are likely on April 9 and 10. Former NIO scientist and meteorologist M R Ramesh Kumar, however, said that this doesn’t qualify as unseasonal rain. “This is pre-monsoon rainfall – from March to May – and contributes substantially to the annual rainfall of several subdivisions. Also, this heralds the coming monsoon season. We forecast the monsoon onset date over Kerala coast using the pre-monsoon rainfall peak which occurs over the four subdivisions over peninsular India,” he said. The pre-monsoon season contributes to about 4% of the annual rainfall. The 2021 pre-monsoon season has a deficit of about minus 46% for the Indian subcontinent, Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/increase-in-cloud-formation-light-rain-likely-on-fri/articleshow/81940103.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Teacher searches for missing student, finds out 14-year-old has been married off for Rs 6,000 in lockdown||DEHRADUN: When school reopened in February at a village in Chamoli, one girl was missing. The teacher asked around. He had gone door to door, calling students back to school. Exams were round the corner and she was nowhere to be found. After relentless questioning, the girl’s father finally confessed that the 14-year-old had been married off to a 32-year-old man for which Rs 6,000 had exchanged hands during the lockdown. For a year, she had been tortured and raped. With threats of the implications of child marriage, the teacher managed to persuade her father to bring her back from Dehradun. In a video that has been widely circulated on social media, he narrated the plight of the young girl. After seeing the video, the state has ordered an investigation, following which an FIR is being filed against everyone involved. On Monday, dressed in a pink salwar suit, with a mangalsutra and thick vermillion on her head, the girl was brought to the school. She broke down. “My husband would beat me. He never treated me well,” she told TOI. “Bandhi ke mahine mein hui thi shaadi (I got married during lockdown).” She appeared for her Class VIII exam on Monday and on Tuesday, and is now home. “Her mother died a few years ago. She has three younger siblings at home. Her elder sister, too, had been married off before she turned 18,” the teacher told TOI. “This happens often in the hill districts of Uttarakhand. Poor people give away their daughters, most of whom are underage, for money.” As his plea went viral, the district administration sent a Child Welfare Committee (CWC) official to investigate. “It has been established that the girl is minor and was married to a man who tortured her,” the official, Prabha Rawat, said. Chamoli district magistrate Swati Bhadauriya said the CWC and revenue police went to the village after she saw the video. “We have taken suo motu cognizance of the matter. The teacher’s intervention has been commendable,” she added. Shanti Prasad Dimri, a revenue police official from the village, told TOI the process to register an FIR has started. Dimri added, “We are initiating an FIR under the Pocso Act, for rape and other sections based on a complaint by the girl’s teacher. We are also looking for the middleman who facilitated this.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/teacher-searches-for-missing-student-finds-out-14-yr-old-has-been-married-off-for-rs-6k-in-lockdown/articleshow/81937725.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Sarnaik’s aide arrested in money laundering case||MUMBAI: Enforcement Directorate (ED) has arrested Thane-based builder, Yogesh Deshmukh, an associate of Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik, in the money laundering case related to NSEL scam. The ED produced Deshmukh before a special court on Tuesday which remanded him in ED custody till April 9. The ED is investigating Sarnaik, whose company allegedly received Rs 11 crore from NSEL scam money. It is alleged that Aastha Group defrauded NSEL of Rs 250 crore and Sarnaik’s company Vihang Group helped it to launder the money. Aastha Group and Sarnaik's company, Vihang Group, had formed a joint venture, Vihand Housing Project, and had purchased several plots at Titwala with Deshmukh’s help. ED officials learnt that some of the plots were fraudulently acquired from farmers by Deshmukh. He told ED he used Rs 22 crore to purchase the plots. During investigation, the ED found that Rs 1 crore was used for the payment, whereas Rs 11 crore was transferred to Sarnaik’s company and Rs 10 crore to Deshmukh. Recently, the ED searched Deshmukh’s bungalow in Thane. The ED had attached the Titwala plots in 2014 and afterwards the adjudication authority had confirmed the attachment. The ED officials informed the local revenue authority about the attachment to ensure that no further transactions related to the land take place. But the revenue officials failed to take the ED’s attachment order notice on their record. Recently, the ED officials learnt that Deshmukh with the help of Sarnaik was developing the attached plots for sale. The ED followed up the issue with the revenue official to take the attachment order on the revenue department record and took possession of the lands in January.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sarnaiks-aide-arrested-in-money-laundering-case/articleshow/81940124.cms||Vijay V Singh

The committee said in its report that the status of CETPs regarding their upgradation has been the same since January 2020. TOI had reported in February that all 13 CETPs do not meet permissible water quality standards. “Delhi government is working continuously towards fulfilling chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s dream of making the Yamuna clean by 2023. The government has taken several effective measures to clean the river on a war footing. DPCC has found that the 13 CETPs of Delhi are either non-functional or partially functional, which is causing massive pollution to the Yamuna. DPCC has, therefore, issued a show-cause notice to CETPs for imposing total environmental compensation of Rs 12 crore based on the monthly analysis reports of its laboratories since February 2020,” said an official. Thirteen CETPs are operational in Delhi with a total capacity of 212.3 MLD for treating effluent waste released from 17 industrial areas. All these CETPs do not comply with standards with respect to biochemical oxygen demand, total dissolved solid, sulphide and chloride.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dpcc-imposes-rs-12cr-fine-on-13-sewage-plants/articleshow/81958744.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

In Kolhapur, shop owners disregarded district collector Daulat Desai’s mandate and kept their businesses open on Tuesday. There was confusion in Aurangabad and Pune over the government order. On Monday, the representatives of the Kolhapur Chamber of Commerce and Industries (KCCI) had met the authorities and warned that they would not follow the order and said shops would stay open on weekdays. The traders, however, assured to keep their businesses shut on Saturdays and Sundays as part of the weekend restrictions. Kolhapur district guardian minister Satej Patil requested the Kolhapur traders to shut their shops on Tuesday after assuring them that a meeting with the district authorities will be called on Wednesday. Responding to the request, KCCI appealed to the traders to shut their shops by 3pm and they complied. Meanwhile, the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (MACCIA) on Tuesday gave a 48-hour ultimatum to the Uddhav Thackeray government to withdraw the order by 6pm on April 8. MACCIA president Santosh Mandlecha gave the ultimatum during an online meeting of representatives of different trade associations from Pune, Solapur, Kolhapur, Aurangabad, Nagpur, Gondia, Amravati and Mumbai. The resolution of the meeting is to be sent to CM Thackeray, deputy CM Ajit Pawar, chief secretary Sitaram Kunte and governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. “If the government fails to withdraw its order, traders across the state will go ahead and open their shops,” Mandlecha told TOI. He appealed to the state government to come out with a more logical order. Earlier, Mohan Gurnani, president of Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industry and Trade (CAMIT), said this was not a “chain breaking, but trade breaking” order. Rajendra Bhatiya, Maharashtra president of Confederation of All-India Traders, said the state has allowed e-commerce and home delivery of food, but has ordered closure of non-essential shops. Bhatiya said they may consider moving court against the state government on this issue. KCCI president Sanjay Shete said that the state government should either close all shops, or allow all to operate. Many shopkeepers and vendors in Pune and Aurangabad opened their businesses in the morning. Ajay Shah, senior vice-president of the Chamber of Association of Maharashtra Industry and Trade, said the CM, in his recent public address, did not give any hint of a blanket closure of commercial establishments. “The prohibitory orders issued by the district administration failed to reach the shopkeepers and owners of different commercial establishments on time,” he said. In Pune, garments and hardware shops in Kothrud, retailers in the Laxmi Road area, footwear shops on MG Road and shops in Kondhwa remained open on Tuesday. Some shopkeepers said they were confused about whether the shutdown was to be implemented only on weekends or throughout the month. Fatehchand Ranka, president of the Federation of Trade Association Pune, said: “TV news had created this confusion. But all that was cleared in a meeting that the members held on Monday. These shopkeepers, who kept their shops open on Tuesday, were probably new or non-members. Keeping their shops open is not an act of defiance, but of survival. We are not going to tell anyone to shut their shops, they are keeping them open on their own discretion. The association will not interfere if any action is taken against them.” Ranka said the entire business community is against the order to shut shops. They will be writing a letter to everyone, including the prime minister, chief minister, deputy chief minister, collector, commissioner, deputy commissioner, local MPs and MLAs, to review and reconsider the order. “After we send the letters, we will be meeting and deciding on what further action needs to be taken,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-traders-defy-order-to-keep-shops-open/articleshow/81936988.cms||---

An FIR has been lodged against Trivikramdas under IPC section 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and 406 (criminal breach of trust) at Vrindavan police station on the basis of a complaint lodged by secretary of ISKCON Vrindavan temple management Debashish Ghosh. Talking with TOI, Ghosh said that Trivikramdas joined ISKCON in 2017, presenting himself as a qualified person belonging to a well-off family. He was asked to provide his identity proof but he did not do so despite several requests. During the investigation, the management found that he was a conman and had lied about his credentials. Trivikramdas claimed that he had worked in a GAP company for 15 years in America but the fact is that he has never been there, Ghosh said. Trivikramdas was involved in collecting donations from temple donors. “Instead of depositing the donations in the temple account, he siphoned them off to his own account,” Ghosh said. When he was asked to submit the details of the donation collected by him at the time of financial year ending, Trivikramdas disappeared on February 25, without informing the management. He also took away the receipt books with him. When he did not return, the temple management decided to lodge an FIR against him. Ghosh alleged that Trivikramdas misused his position and breached the trust of the donors and the temple management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/vrindavan-iskcon-functionary-booked-for-embezzling-rs-1-cr-donation-money/articleshow/81936990.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Wheelchair-bound Presidency professor raises harassment plaint against airline||Kolkata: An assistant professor at Presidency University with cerebral palsy disability has alleged harassment before and during travel on the national carrier. The airline, while regretting the inconvenience she had faced, refused to alter its position on the issues. Priyanka De, who teaches philosophy, flew to Delhi by Air India on February 17 and returned by the same airline on February 25. Prior to travel, she had a trying time availing of a concession that the airline offers to persons with locomotor disability. Discounts under various categories, including students and the ones in Armed services, can be availed while purchasing tickets online. But De, who is completely wheelchair-bound and has a disability certificate from the chief medical officer, was unable to avail of the discount online. It was only when she wrote to the Prime Minister’s Office that the airline reached out to her and took the necessary documents over mail to approve the 50% discount on basic fare. “On my return, I wrote to the airline, asking it to ensure that others with similar disability get the discount while purchasing tickets online at a time when Covid is on the rise. But in its reply, the airline has expressed its inability to do so without physically verifying the extent of disability at the airline’s city or airport counter. Why can’t a passenger upload the disability certificate at the time of purchasing the ticket and show it at the time of travel,” De argued. The second issue that she faced was on the return journey when she was not allowed to carry her foldable wheelchair in the cabin, despite the airline website clearly stating that collapsible wheelchair and pair of crutches or braces for passenger use, if dependent on these, are allowed in the cabin. “I have a narrow wheelchair that is collapsible to enable movement in flight and other confined spaces. It is helpful for use in the washroom. But on the afternoon of February 25, the flight crew refused to allow the wheelchair and wanted to stow it away in the belly cargo hold. When I pointed out that I could not use the washroom without it, the crew asked me to go to the toilet after the flight landed. It was inhuman,” she said. The airline pointed out that the space constraint in the narrow body aircraft had prompted the crew to stow it in the cabin bulk head after taking permission from the flight commander. “Efforts were made to put the chair in the overhead cabin but since it could not fit there, it was shifted to the alternative storage space,” said an airline official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/wheelchair-bound-presidency-professor-raises-harassment-plaint-against-airline/articleshow/81938815.cms||---

In Kolhapur, shop owners disregarded district collector Daulat Desai’s mandate and kept their businesses open on Tuesday. There was confusion in Aurangabad and Pune over the government order. On Monday, the representatives of the Kolhapur Chamber of Commerce and Industries (KCCI) had met the authorities and warned that they would not follow the order and said shops would stay open on weekdays. The traders, however, assured to keep their businesses shut on Saturdays and Sundays as part of the weekend restrictions. Kolhapur district guardian minister Satej Patil requested the Kolhapur traders to shut their shops on Tuesday after assuring them that a meeting with the district authorities will be called on Wednesday. Responding to the request, KCCI appealed to the traders to shut their shops by 3pm and they complied. Meanwhile, the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (MACCIA) on Tuesday gave a 48-hour ultimatum to the Uddhav Thackeray government to withdraw the order by 6pm on April 8. MACCIA president Santosh Mandlecha gave the ultimatum during an online meeting of representatives of different trade associations from Pune, Solapur, Kolhapur, Aurangabad, Nagpur, Gondia, Amravati and Mumbai. The resolution of the meeting is to be sent to CM Thackeray, deputy CM Ajit Pawar, chief secretary Sitaram Kunte and governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. “If the government fails to withdraw its order, traders across the state will go ahead and open their shops,” Mandlecha told TOI. He appealed to the state government to come out with a more logical order. Earlier, Mohan Gurnani, president of Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industry and Trade (CAMIT), said this was not a “chain breaking, but trade breaking” order. Rajendra Bhatiya, Maharashtra president of Confederation of All-India Traders, said the state has allowed e-commerce and home delivery of food, but has ordered closure of non-essential shops. Bhatiya said they may consider moving court against the state government on this issue. KCCI president Sanjay Shete said that the state government should either close all shops, or allow all to operate. Many shopkeepers and vendors in Pune and Aurangabad opened their businesses in the morning. Ajay Shah, senior vice-president of the Chamber of Association of Maharashtra Industry and Trade, said the CM, in his recent public address, did not give any hint of a blanket closure of commercial establishments. “The prohibitory orders issued by the district administration failed to reach the shopkeepers and owners of different commercial establishments on time,” he said. In Pune, garments and hardware shops in Kothrud, retailers in the Laxmi Road area, footwear shops on MG Road and shops in Kondhwa remained open on Tuesday. Some shopkeepers said they were confused about whether the shutdown was to be implemented only on weekends or throughout the month. Fatehchand Ranka, president of the Federation of Trade Association Pune, said: “TV news had created this confusion. But all that was cleared in a meeting that the members held on Monday. These shopkeepers, who kept their shops open on Tuesday, were probably new or non-members. Keeping their shops open is not an act of defiance, but of survival. We are not going to tell anyone to shut their shops, they are keeping them open on their own discretion. The association will not interfere if any action is taken against them.” Ranka said the entire business community is against the order to shut shops. They will be writing a letter to everyone, including the prime minister, chief minister, deputy chief minister, collector, commissioner, deputy commissioner, local MPs and MLAs, to review and reconsider the order. “After we send the letters, we will be meeting and deciding on what further action needs to be taken,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/kolhapur-traders-defy-order-to-keep-shops-open/articleshow/81942713.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Anxious, excited first-time voters leave indelible mark||Coimbatore: Twenty-year-old K Aarthi of Selvapuram in the city was on cloud nine after casting vote for the first time on Tuesday. Though she struggled to choose the right candidate initially, Aarthi read manifestos of all political parties to take a decision. She is now praying for the victory of the candidate she voted for. “I want the government to create job opportunities for youngsters in the state, ensure basic amenities and empower farmers. I choose the candidate whose party had assured to fulfil these demands after discussing with my parents and friends,” Aarthi told TOI. Nineteen-year-old A Vigneshwari of Kempetti Colony was all smiles after she stepped out of the polling booth. She clicked selfies with her relatives with the inked finger in focus. “Voters here have been choosing one of the two major parties for decades. We have seen a lot of corruption and scams. I don’t know what other parties are capable of doing if elected to power, but I wanted to give them a chance. I don’t want the mainstream parties to come to power,” she said. Young voters like N Priya, 19, of Selvapuram was all for women empowerment and voted for women candidates. “Women are generally ignored, especially in politics. Even in this election, not many women candidates are contesting. So, I decided to vote for a woman candidate. I didn’t discuss with my parents or friends before I took the decision. I am not even sure that she will win. At least she had the courage to compete in the male-dominated field and deserves applause. Why should men have all the power all the time?” Unlike Priya, A Sathish Kumar, 18, of Periyar Nagar consulted his parents and friends before voting. “Before this election, I had no idea about the democratic process,” he confided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/anxious-excited-first-time-voters-leave-indelible-mark/articleshow/81940118.cms||Nivedha Selvam

During the 2020 lockdown, meter readers did not go to societies in containment zones for two to three months, resulting in hefty bills in June. Raut said MSEDCL was making efforts to reduce tariff and for this, it had to bring down pow-er purchase costs. Power purchase agreements were being reviewed and 1100MW to 1800MW electricity was being procured from the power exchange for wh-ich the costs were “being negotiated” to reduce expenses. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-send-meter-readings-avoid-hefty-power-bills-says-min/articleshow/81941231.cms||Somit Sen

You need patience||AHMEDABAD: Paldi resident Jayshree Desai, on Tuesday, made 15-odd calls to city-based hospitals for her septuagenarian father, a patient of multiple diseases including diabetes. “Everywhere I called, the ICU and ventilator beds for Covid-19 were full and I was asked to register my name and number so that I can be informed when one of the beds gets vacant,” she recounts. “I used all my contacts. I am awaiting a call to shift him immediately.” She’s not alone in the ordeal. TOI carried out a reality check on Tuesday by calling up 11 of the most prominent hospitals in western Ahmedabad and found that beds were filling fast in most of them. And, except one, all had their ICU and ventilator beds full. Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA) data on Tuesday revealed that, in all, 81% of 3,945 beds were occupied. Among the categories, 85% of ICU beds and 82% of ventilator beds were full. AHNA president Bharat Gadhvi said that they convened a meeting on Tuesday to discuss the situation. “We have appealed to our members to add as many beds as possible. We also request bigger hospitals that have not admitted Covid patients so far, to earmark a few beds to tackle the rush,” Dr Gadhvi said, adding that they intend to add a substantial number soon. AHNA officials said that the move to include smaller hospitals and nursing homes can also work well to tackle mild and moderate cases. Civil Hospital on Tuesday made the newly constructed eye hospital operational for Covid-19, adding 400 beds. Hospital sources said that out of 940 available beds at 1,200-bed hospital, 794 were occupied.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/want-icu-bed-for-covid-patient-you-need-patience/articleshow/81938919.cms||Himanshu Kaushik
---||India||IMA says provide remdesivir also to the home-isolated||PUNE: Medical experts have now suggested use of the anti-viral remdesivir in eligible home-isolated Covid patients, who are not admitted to hospitals. Currently, the drug is given only to hospitalized patients. At a recent meeting with the Pune Covid task force and Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) health officials, members of the Indian Medical Association said remdesivir can be given to carefully selected home-isolated patients on an OPD basis either at clinics or hospitals. The IMA suggestion has a significant basis as a huge chunk of new Covid patients have opted for home isolation. If some of these patients experience drops in blood oxygen levels, they’ll have to seek out hospital beds to get remdesivir. “Giving remdesivir on an OPD basis is medically termed as ambulatory daycare administration. This is quite prevalent in western countries. If allowed, this will cut down hospitalization and reduce the burden on hospitals,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) Hospital Board of India (HBI). Critical care experts, however, urged caution. Sanjeev Wavare, PMC’s nodal officer for Covid-19, said, “The suggestion is currently under consideration.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ima-says-provide-remdesivir-also-to-the-home-isolated/articleshow/81942365.cms||---

He also said that over 12 lakh beneficiaries had been vaccinated in Delhi and hoped that vaccination would soon be provided to the entire population, as proposed by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in his letter to the Prime Minister.“So far, there is only one day where the positivity rate was more than 5%. The trend needs to be monitored, and we are keeping a close watch on it. Currently, the positivity rate has crossed the 5% mark for the entire country. However, in Delhi, we are completely alert and are being cautious,” Jain said in a press conference.“We have directed both the government and private hospitals to escalate the number of Covid beds. Almost 5,000 beds will be added in both private and Delhi government hospitals,” he said.Jain said he was hopeful that the vaccination would soon be rolled out for the entire population barring the age limit, as suggested by the chief minister. “So far, only people above 45 years have been allowed to get the vaccination. The benefit of rolling out the vaccine to all will be that the young generation, although do not face problems, can act as carriers,” he said. “If they test positive, their families would be at risk of contracting the infection. Vaccination should be done in a stretch so that it would have the ultimate effect.” The minister said that of the vaccinations carried out on Monday, around 27% were in private and 73% in government hospitals. “Government centres utilised 95% of the available slots whereas it was 67% in private hospitals. People are preferring government facilities for vaccination over private hospitals and the majority are going to government hospitals unlike before,” he said. “Vaccination sites in all 33 Delhi government hospitals will be functional for 24 hours.”Delhi has sufficient doses of vaccines as of now, Jain pointed out. “The important point is that only registered people can go to vaccination centres from 9am to 3pm. Post 3pm, people can avail the walk-in facility,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/keeping-an-eye-on-situation-over-12l-vaccinated-says-jain/articleshow/81938822.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Delhi||Another grim milestone, 5,000 Covid cases revisited in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Delhi recorded 5,100 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, the highest in four months, while 17 more fatalities due to the infection took the death toll to 11,113. A record 1.03 lakh tests were conducted in the past 24 hours. This included 69,667 RT-PCR and 33,786 rapid antigen tests. The case positivity rate stands at 4.93 per cent amid a massive surge in coronavirus cases in the last few weeks. The number of cumulative cases on Tuesday stood at 6,85,062, while over 6.56 lakh patients have recovered from the disease. Delhi had reported 3,548 cases and 15 deaths on Monday, and 4,033 cases and 21 deaths on Sunday. A total of 3,567 coronavirus cases were reported on Saturday and 3,594 cases on Friday. On December 8 last year, the city had recorded 3,188 cases. According to the latest health bulletin, the number of active cases rose to 17,332 on Tuesday from 14,589 a day before. The number of people under home isolation increased to 8,871 on Tuesday from 7,983 on Monday, while the number of containment zones mounted to 3,291 from 3,090 a day before. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said the state government was alert on the pandemic situation and keeping a ‘close watch’ on it. The rise in active cases has led to a heavy rush for beds in hospitals. There are 8,120 Covid beds across the city hospitals. Of them, data shared by the hospitals shows 3,558 (44%) are occupied. The occupancy of Covid ICU beds with and without a ventilator stands at 60% and 52%, respectively. “I am inundated with requests for beds for Covid-19 patients. Many people are coming from neighbouring states as well. The situation is turning serious. People should restrict movement, unless necessary. They should wear masks and maintain distance if they must go out,” one of the doctors said. The demand for plasma has also gone up at the plasma bank run by Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences. The capital witnessed three peaks in Covid-19 cases last year— in May, August and November, respectively. December onwards, the cases started to come down. However, there has been an exponential increase in new cases over the past two weeks. The presence of mutated strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is considered a key factor behind this. But most importantly, doctors say, non-adherence to preventive measures such as wearing a mask and maintaining social distancing was behind the sudden surge in cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/another-grim-milestone-5k-cases-revisited/articleshow/81938810.cms||---

After an anticipated rise in cases of Covid-19 positive patients in April last year, guardian minister Nitin Raut had got funds sanctioned by government for increasing number of beds. The then municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe developed five DCHCs having 470 beds including 50 ICU beds. A 130-bed new DCHC was developed at KT Nagar including some ICU beds in May last year. NMC converted its Pachpaoli Women’s Hospital into DCHC with 110 beds also in May last year. Both these hospitals are not being used for Covid patients. Indira Gandhi Rugnalaya (IGR) was renovated and developed into DCHC with 130 beds including some ICU beds. The civic body has brought into use 110 beds here of which 75 were occupied on Tuesday. NMC also renovated and developed Sadar and Isolation hospitals into DCHC with 40 and 60 beds respectively. Sadar hospital is being utilized fully while and 32 beds are in use at Isolation hospital. 38 and 14 patients were admitted at these places on Tuesday, respectively. NMC is thus using only 182 of total 470 beds in five DCHCs. NMC officials informally stated the main reason for not bringing them into use was lack of doctors and nursing staff. However, NMC is not admitting it on record. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari told TOI, “KT Nagar DCHC is in controversy and could not be started due to some technical problems. Two vaccination centres are in operation at Pachpaoli Women’s Hospital along with Covid testing centre and a maternity ward.” “NMC is making all efforts to provide beds for patients. It developed a walk-in-oxygen centre at Pachpaoli Covid Care Centre last year. This has been converted into DCHC with 72 beds recently. Patients are already admitted at this facility,” he added. Tiwari further said around 300-400 patients admitted in GMCH, IGGMCH and private hospitals needed just oxygen and remdesivir. “Therefore, we are planning to convert Pachpaoli DCHC into a walk-in-remdesivir centre. Patients can be discharged from GMCH, IGGMCH and private hospitals and can be admitted here for oxygen and remdesivir and sent home once recovered. This will help make more beds available for critical patients,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/despite-shortage-of-beds-nmcs-two-covid-hosps-not-in-use/articleshow/81940107.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Nagpur||Minister Kadu slaps mess staffer at Akola GMCH||Nagpur: Maharashtra minister of state and Akola guardian minister Bachchu Kadu slapped a mess staffer at the Akola Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) for allegedly botching up food supply to Covid patients. Kadu, who is on a 3-day Akola visit, conducted a surprise inspection of the GMCH mess after some videos of poor quality food had gone viral on social media. He interacted with cooks, workers and the contractor of the mess. Finding the quality of pulses poor, he asked how much quantity of pulses is cooked daily for the entire hospital, where more than 1,500 patients are under treatment. Contractor Sahebrao Kulmethe told him that they needed 10kg pulses daily. Kadu asked the same question to kitchen in-charge staffer Sunil Morey, who said they cook not more than 6kg pulses daily. After inspection, Kadu brought both the contractor and employees together and again asked the same question. This time, Morey changed his words and said they cook 10 kg pulses everyday, which made Kadu angry. After repeatedly asking him to tell the truth, Kadu slapped Morey. Kadu, who is the minister of state for water resources and school education, told TOI there is a “scam” in GMCH Akola’s mess. “A month’s supply of grains was demanded as per the register here, but only 8 days’ worth food grains were supplied. For the last 8 months, there has been no record of food grains arriving at the district hospital for Covid patients,” said Kadu, adding that he had ordered an inquiry into the issue. “Instead of the slapping incident, one must concentrate on the gross corruption that was noticed during inspection,” the minster said. Kadu has tasked Akola sub-divisional officer Nilesh Apar with the inquiry of the case. Sources said that suspension action was proposed in the case. The person who got slapped from Kadu is a contractual employee. Political reactions started immediately after the video of Kadu slapping the mess staffer went viral. “Does the rule of law exist in the state? How can a minister beat an employee over a meal issue?” tweeted BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar. “File a case against Bachchu Kadu for assaulting a government employee,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/minister-kadu-slaps-mess-staffer-at-akola-gmch/articleshow/81938838.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Man loses Rs 1 lakh through fake customer care||VIJAYAWADA: A resident in Guntur city lost close to Rs 1 lakh after contacting a bogus Phone Pe customer care service on Tuesday. According to police sources, the man identified as Nagaraju runs a catering business and resides in IPD Colony in Guntur city. Cops said that Nagaraju had recently transferred around Rs 400 to his friend who informed him that he had not received the amount. As the money had been deducted from his account, Nagraju searched for a customer care number online and contacted them. They assured that the money would be returned and asked him to read out a code sent to his phone. Unaware that the customer care number was fake, he read out the code and lost Rs 49,248 from his account. Noticing the transaction, he once again contacted the same number and informed them about the withdrawal. They once again assured that the entire amount would be deposited to his account and sought another verification code. This time, Nagaraju lost Rs 48,657 from his account. He tried to contact the same number again but noticed it had been switched off. He then approached police who have registered a case and are trying to recover the money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/man-loses-rs-1l-through-fake-customer-care/articleshow/81937571.cms||---

Work has started to construct 300 recharge pits along the 29-km-long metro rail alignment for the purpose. Besides, rainwater harvesting systems will also be developed at half a dozen other locations to maximize the collection of rainwater. According to the Metro project officials, the initiative is aimed at improving the depleting groundwater levels in the city. Of the 15 blocks in the district, at least 12 are in the “dark zone”. So far, more than 40 recharge pits have been excavated for the three elevated metro stations situated on Fatehabad Road. Kumar Keshav, managing director, Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation, said, “More than 15 lakh litres of groundwater is being recharged by Lucknow Metro. This same is being implemented by Kanpur Metro Project. Along these lines, Agra Metro Project is also making elaborate arrangements for groundwater recharge and rainwater harvesting. This metro project will be the first of its kind in Agra to take such extensive steps for groundwater recharge.” The Agra Metro rail project is likely to be completed by 2025.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-metro-aims-to-recharge-10l-litres-of-groundwater-every-year/articleshow/81936998.cms||---

Under this campaign, a rail wrap and radio jingle are being publicised in various cities of India. Hoardings have also been installed in cities like Delhi and Mumbai to promote tourism. The tourism department has selected trains going to cities — Mumbai, Nashik, Bhopal, Jhansi, Agra, Delhi and Meerut. Initially, as part of the campaign, train wrapping was done for train running from Haridwar to Mumbai's Lokmanya Tilak station. The campaign depicts Char Dhams (Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath), Hemkund Sahib, state’s cultural costumes, folk songs, cuisines etc. These creatives are attracting devotees and tourists through interesting taglines. Similarly, to promote adventure-related activities in the state, a radio jingle is running in cities like Delhi, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Pune and Dehradun which is being appreciated by the listeners. Tourism minister Satpal Maharj said, “We are all set to welcome devotees from all over the world as the Char Dham Yatra will commence in May. This campaign is a part of inviting devotees to the yatra and tourists to enjoy adventure activities in the state.” Tourism secretary Dilip Jawalkar said, “Uttarakhand is fully prepared to welcome tourists. We are ready to provide all kinds of services to the tourists and following the Covid-19 guidelines.

It is too tiring to travel all the way to the district from Bengaluru just for a day. There is also the question of getting leave, as many colleagues would be applying for leave to vote,” she said.The work from home option has helped many like her, who are employed in other states, to cast their votes without any difficulties.D Karthika, 28, who had left the state for work in 2013, couldn’t agree more. “I work in Mumbai and we don’t get compulsory leave for the assembly election in Tamil Nadu. As it is too tiring and expensive to travel just for a day, I have to take leave for a week at least and the flight tickets alone will cost me more than Rs10,000. So, I had skipped all the elections. Now that I have been staying at home for the past one year, I could vote this time without any hassle.”M Vinoth Arasan is another voter who benefitted from the work from home option. “Usually, I take leave for a day and travel to Salem from Bengaluru to cast vote. As many Tamils are working in Bengaluru, it would be so difficult to catch a bus, most of which would be crowded. This year, work from home option has saved me from all the hurdles. I did not even apply for permission as the polling timing - from 7am to 7pm - was so convenient.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/whf-makes-it-easy-for-many-to-exercise-right-to-franchise/articleshow/81940122.cms||Nivedha Selvam

---||Pune||Pune: Hard-pressed employers letting go of migrant staff||PUNE: Unlike last year, small business employers are no longer taking the responsibility of arranging for food and lodging of their staff in the current situation. They said they would send their employees back to their home towns while businesses remain shut. A barber from Kasba Peth said business was less than 50% of pre-Covid days at his shop. “Running the house has also become stressful. I cannot afford to take the responsibility of food and lodging of my employees when there will be no income this month. I have bought two of them tickets to go back to their home towns in UP and Bihar,” he said. A restaurant owner in Hinjewadi said he was in so much debt that running the business was impossible due to the shutdown this month. “I am barely being able to make ends meet at home, and I have no money to take the responsibility of my staff this time. I have no choice but to send them back,” he added. Construction workers too want to go back home. “I don’t earn much, and send a chunk to my parents, wife and two kids in Odisha. Last year, we had money with to buy food, and they were depending on local volunteers and charity. I was in Pune, but my basic needs were taken care of by my employers. It is better I go back. Even if I don’t earn as much as I do in Pune, my family will survive,” a waiter at a mess on Laxmi Road said. He will be going back with three more servers and kitchen staff from the eateries in the same area. “I spent the last lockdown in Pune. I was not ill but it was very lonely. I had no one to share my fears and I was under a lot of stress. My relatives said the situation in West Bengal is much better than in Pune. I came to Pune five years ago for work, and till the pandemic hit I thought it was the right decision. But with all the uncertainty, it is best to go back,” a salon worker said. A tailor said he had lived with four other workers, but two of them went back home last year. “It was difficult to share responsibilities and expenses between the two of us who stayed back. Our salaries were cut to half because the shop was barely doing any business. This month we will be having zero income, and expenses will go up. We belong to the same village in UP and will be going back together,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hard-pressed-employers-letting-go-of-migrant-staff/articleshow/81938848.cms||---

In Pandalur forest range, a father-son duo were killed in a wild elephant attack a month ago. Kalai Vendan, forest range officer, said, “We have deputed 15 field staff members in seven booths, where movement of wild animals, especially elephants, is common. They will guard the booths till the electronic voting machines are shifted to strong room.” According to him, no movement of elephants has been recorded close to the polling booths so far.In Cherambadi forest range, 18 members of the forest field staff are stationed at six polling stations. “We have deployed a team of three field staff members in each of the six polling booths. It’s to ensure safety of both the voters and polling booth officials,” said Anand Kumar, forest range officer. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/when-forest-field-staff-kept-watch-on-polling-stations/articleshow/81940130.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Delhi: Factories brace for shorter shifts, fear output may be hit||NEW DELHI: The latest curbs in Delhi have raised apprehensions about working in night shifts and operations being impacted with a number of factory operators expressing concern that this may ultimately result in a full lockdown. Members of industrial associations said the restricted movement would lead to shorter shifts and hamper specialised trades that need to operate round the clock. Some factory owners rued that the guidelines were unclear and transportation wouldn’t be possible if factories were not open for loading, unloading and processing of goods. In outer Delhi’s Bawana Industrial Area, Prakash Chand Jain runs a factory recycling iron to produce sheets that are utilised to manufacture other products. The head of Bawana Chamber of Industries said around 15% of factories in the area operate at night. “The state government can specifically target areas where crowding is taking place or rules are not being followed. Some trades, like plastic units, need continuous operation as furnaces cannot be doused and reheating takes several hours. We hope to get clarity on this soon. The government should also think about prioritising vaccination for the workforce,” added Jain. Manish Mangla from Wazirpur Industrial Area, a hub of stainless steel utensil manufacturing units, said, “Even if the movement outside is prohibited, factory workers should be allowed. While manufacturing copper wire, furnaces take a lot of energy and time to heat, so work can’t be stopped. We will also have to reduce shift hours so that people can reach home early.” Neeraj Sehgal, general secretary of Mayapuri Industrial Welfare Association, said movement of goods and raw materials usually occurs at night. “Factories need to remain open for loading, unloading and processing goods. I operate an ice cream factory and stopping operations at night will lead to wastage of materials,” Sehgal added. Apex Chamber of Commerce and Industries head Raghuvansh Arora said the restrictions would impact the revival of the industrial sector, which was already in the doldrums. “We have advised factory owners to give applications to SDMs about night operations with an assurance that workers will remain inside the premises between 9pm and 6.30am. Manufacturing of plastic goods, chemicals, electrical products, ice cream and frozen items requires round-the-clock operations,” he added. Sheesh Sharma from Mundka Industrial Association, who manufactures metal furniture and related goods, said, “The shifts will now have to be shorter so that people can reach home before 10pm. Our operations are already impacted due to the farmers’ protest at Tikri border. The restrictions will worsen the situation. Panicked workers are thinking about leaving the capital, which will result in shortage of labour.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/factories-brace-for-shorter-shifts-fear-output-may-be-hit/articleshow/81938831.cms||Paras Singh
---||Delhi||Traders unhappy, expect loss of biz due to early closure of shops||New Delhi: The announcement of restrictions from 10pm to 5am has not gone down well with traders, who are already facing losses and are unhappy with thecurbs imposed in markets.The traders argue that markets remain open till late in summer as people don’t prefer to come out during the day. Moreover, their employees leave only after the shops are closed. Now, they will need to wind up in advance as the staff will insist upon leaving early to avail of public transport.Amit Gupta, executive member of New Delhi Traders’ Association, said, “Our outlets are open till 9.15pm in summer because customers visit us till late at night. After closing the shop, our employees take 30-45 minutes to wrap up everything before leaving for home. But now, since people won’t be allowed to travel after 10pm, they will insist upon leaving early. The decision has come as a huge surprise for us as no discussion took place with traders.”In Old Delhi, traders had more reasons to worry. Though the wholesale markets close by 7-8pm, a majority of customers come from other states, who would stay away now. Transportation would be another problem as vehicles carrying non-essential goods won’t be allowed entry at night. After 6pm, the vehicles won’t be allowed to cross the borders.Devraj Baweja of Sadar Bazar Traders’ Association said, “We suffered 40-50% losses last year due to the pandemic. Now, things have already started getting worse at the beginning of the year. Migrant labourers are panicking with the announcement and fear facing a similar situation like last year when they had to leave for their hometowns after the sudden lockdown. People from other states have started avoiding coming to the market.”Vijay Kumar, a trader in South Extension-I market, said a trend had picked up last year to open shops early and close them by 7.30-8pm. “This order might not impact our operations, but business will definitely be affected drastically. It will dissuade customers from coming to the market for shopping, eating and spending some quality time because they will need to reach home by 10pm,” he added.At Sarojini Nagar Market, the district administration engaged civil defence volunteers at all four entries for thermal scanning and sanitisation of staff on Tuesday.Ashok Randhawa of Mini Market Traders’ Association said, “Even policemen are present at the entries for assistance. For maintaining social distancing inside shops, circles have been made outside. Challans were issued by New Delhi Municipal Council to 20-30 people for not wearing masks. We appreciate the action, but the existing situation has created fear among visitors. Despite it being the wedding season, there is no rush in the market.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/traders-unhappy-expect-loss-of-biz-due-to-early-closure-of-shops/articleshow/81938845.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Delhi||Couple found dead in Paharganj hotel room, suicide pact suspected||New Delhi: A 30-year-old man and his girlfriend were found dead in their hotel room in central Delhi’s Paharganj on Tuesday afternoon. The couple allegedly consumed poison and cops suspect they were involved in a “suicide pact” on the basis of a note found in the room. Deputy commissioner of police (Central) Jasmeet Singh said, “A PCR call was received around 3pm at Nabi Karim police station regarding a possible suicide in a hotel room by a man and woman, both aged around 30 years.” The woman has been identified as Sarika, a resident of Sultanpuri, and the man, Vikas, from Kirari. Police officers found the couple on a bed in the hotel room. They were taken to a hospital and declared dead on arrival. The bodies were then preserved at the mortuary for postmortem, which is likely to be conducted in the presence of their families on Wednesday. Cops have recovered insecticide pills from the room and sent them for forensic examination. Police have also found a suicide note, which said that the couple were taking the drastic step of their own will. The note mentioned that they were in love but the woman was being married against her wishes with someone else. The couple had checked into the hotel on Tuesday morning. They knew each other for a decade and had been in a relationship. Cops will soon record the statements of their family members and friends.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/couple-found-dead-in-paharganj-hotel-room-suicide-pact-suspected/articleshow/81938851.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Traders protest, but cops go ‘soft’ on Day 1||Nagpur: The first day of the state-imposed Covid curbs in the city on Tuesday saw cops slipping into sympathetic mode with the traders, who took to the streets defying the ban on gathering of five or more people at one place under Section 144 raising voice against the restrictions. The cops remained in negotiating mood with the traders before sounding a caution to them. Though, later in the evening, the cops decided to enforce the ‘night curfew’ more stringently from the second day. City police chief Amitesh Kumar said he did not want to unleash brute force initially on the protesting traders, who had resorted to impromptu agitation at some places like Shaheed Chowk and adjoining locality where some cloth merchants had opened their shops in protest. “We are adopting tactical approach rather than tough enforcement as the situation requires more sensitive handling,” he said. Despite the agitations at Itwari and also in Sitabuldi, police had decided to go slow on the protesters and disperse them with persuasion rather than taking tough stance against them including filing of FIR till going to the press, for the violations of Section144 of the criminal procedure code (CrPC). “On the first day, we had met some traders’ associations in the morning and again received more deputations in the evening over the restrictions and grievances. We will forward all the grievances to the competent authorities and also to the state government,” said the top cop. The CP said traders can protest within the framework of the imposed restrictions after following Covid-appropriate behaviour like wearing mask and observing Covid distancing. “Nothing would be tolerated after a certain patient hearing and warning as the restrictions would have to be enforced,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/traders-protest-but-cops-go-soft-on-day-1/articleshow/81938863.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Coimbatore||Covid-19 patients, symptomatic people give poll cold shoulder||Coimbatore: Only nine out of the 2,577-odd Covid-19 patients in the district came forward to cast their vote on Tuesday, despite the Election Commission allotting an exclusive hour for them. While seven patients from the Covid care centre at Karunya University in Madhampalayam cast their votes in two booths — a government high school and primary school in S S Kulam — two from city-based KG Hospital exercised their franchise at Peelamedu. The patients from KG Hospital arrived at the booth in plainclothes and changed into PPE kits and wore masks in the ambulance before stepping into the polling station. The entire process took only a few minutes and was simple, a hospital spokesperson said. The seven patients from the Covid care centre were wary of the stigma associated with the virus and refused to wear PPE kits and even refused to be photographed for documentation purposes. This forced polling officers in S S Kulam polling booth to protect themselves by wearing PPE kits. Despite providing concessions to the patients, including offering to pick them up and drop them back in ambulances, most of them refused to come out and vote. Even the 70-odd patients in home isolation within the corporation limits refused to step out. This despite health officers calling them a day earlier and on Tuesday to motivate them. “As some patients were wary of using ambulance, we allowed home isolation patients to come in their own vehicles to the booths and offered to escort them into a separate room to vote,” said city health officer Dr S Raja. “We called more than 40 patients on Monday and Tuesday to motivate them. But none were willing.” Even mildly symptomatic patients in private and government hospitals refused to vote. “None of them were ready to vote because of issues like their polling booths being too far away or them becoming too tired to vote,” said an official from Royal Care Hospital. Meanwhile, 281 people tested positive for the virus on Tuesday, taking the total number of cases to 60,821. With 145 people getting discharged, the number of active cases rose to 2,577. There was also one death due to the virus, taking the toll to 695.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/covid-19-patients-symptomatic-people-give-poll-cold-shoulder/articleshow/81940135.cms||---

One of their associates is, however, absconding. Police said the accused were running the illegal unit in a sugarcane field in Fatehpur Sikri. Superintendent of police (west) Satyajeet Gupta said 700 litres of rectified spirit in 10 plastic cans, 100 litres of illicit liquor and a packing machine for the sealing liquor bottles were seized. The SP said the accused would usually produce 12-15 cartons of liquor daily and had been paying Rs 400 per carton to the owner of the sugarcane field where they had their manufacturing unit set up. Two accused — Sudheer Singh, 23, and Gulab Singh, 30 — were arrested, while one Guddu Baghel fled the spot, said police, adding that the accused were booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Excise Act. Police, meanwhile, in a separate incident, seized 34 cartons of illicit foreign-made liquor that were being smuggled to UP from Rajasthan in a car.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/illicit-liquor-manufacturing-unit-being-run-from-sugarcane-field-busted-two-arrested/articleshow/81937013.cms||---

---||Delhi||Mosquito density six times above normal in Delhi||NEW DELHI: If you have been worried about abnormally high numbers of mosquitoes in and around your house, it is not merely a case of exaggerated perception. A survey conducted to assess mosquito density in south Delhi has detected density levels that are over six times higher than normal for this time of the year. The exercise, carried out by South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), has found that West zone has the highest density at 7.2 units (man per hour), followed by Central zone with 6.6 units, South with 5.8 units and Najafgarh with the least at 4.8. The sampling was carried out in multiple areas, including Tughlaqabad Extension, Neb Sarai, Mahavir Enclave and Hari Nagar. But there’s a good news. The mosquitoes, a senior public health official said, are of the Culex genus and do not cause dengue/malaria. Hence, the cases of reported vector-borne diseases still remain low. “Ideally the mosquito density should be zero to one. But very few mosquitoes are from the genus Anopheles that causes malaria and the genus Aedes causing dengue and chikungunya. The density of Anopheles and Aedes are still around zero,” the official said. Culex mosquitoes bite and cause skin irritation. In some cases, female Culex mosquitoes cause arbovirus infections such as Japanese encephalitis and filariasis, he added. An early rise in temperature has led to the sudden spurt while clogged drains and stagnating water have also contributed, said another official. “Mosquitoes become active above 35 degrees Celsius and we have witnessed an unusual early beginning of summer this year,” the official added. An entomologist of SDMC said that in dense urban areas like Delhi, it was not possible to achieve zero levels, but normally 1-2 man per hour density was observed. An analysis of one-year mosquito breeding data from three civic bodies shows that peri-domestic containers — money plants, vases, flower pots, bird pots, tin, tyre, fountain water etc — account for the largest chunk — 38% — of breeding sites. Domestic water storage containers, usually used in water-stressed regions, come second at 33%, it reveals. Desert coolers, which find significant usage in Delhi in the summer, and overhead tanks come at the third and fourth spots, respectively. With an early summer, the breeding sites in desert coolers are expected to see a spike. Vulnerable areas that see overlap of water supply problems and frequent occurrence of mosquito-borne diseases include Aya nagar, Dera Mandi, Jaunapur, Ambedkar Nagar, Sangam Vihar, Mahipalpur, Madangir, Madanpur Khadar, Dakshinpuri and Uttam Nagar. In a joint inter-departmental meeting on Tuesday, SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti expressed concerns over floating hyacinth in the Yamuna near the Okhla barrage, which is affecting nearby colonies. All departments concerned agreed to remove hyacinth and desilt drains in a time-bound manner. The meeting, convened by Bharti, was attended by the district magistrate and senior officials of DDA, irrigation & flood control departments of both Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, DJB, ASI and PWD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mosquito-density-six-times-above-normal/articleshow/81938870.cms||Paras Singh
---||Delhi||On eateries’ plate, even more disappointment||New Delhi: A restaurant manager felt it was April 2020 all over again. Looking at his phone flashing the Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s notification on the imposition of night restrictions in the city, he shuddered when he recalled being asked to go on indefinite leave without pay last April. The ordeal lasted till he re-joined work in September at 30% of his pre-Covid salary, which was boosted to 70% in December. He was looking forward to a 100% restoration from next week only to be wracked with anxiety again. Like the eatery manager, restaurant owners too have been taken by surprise by the resurgence of Covid-19, leaving them disappointed that their tentative business recovery might be truncated. Akshay Anand, the co-founder of Ophelia and Toy Room, said the sudden announcement would impact livelihoods and hoped the state government would rethink its strategy on ways to fight the pandemic. Kabir Suri, vice-president, National Restaurant Association of India, and co-founder, Azure Hospitality, argued that the 10pm restrictions start implied restaurants shutting down by 9pm to allow diners, staff and delivery agents to reach their homes in time. Restaurateurs point out that dinner time in Delhi starts around 9.30pm and accounts for at least 60% of delivery and dine-in business. Till last week, the authorities were assuring the restaurateurs of there being no plans to impose a curfew or a lockdown. Umang Tiwari of Big Fish Ventures was critical of such assurances, accusing the authorities of buoying their spirits only to make them pay the licence fees and taxes in advance. Explaining why the sudden imposition of the night curbs was not conducive to business, Joy Singh of Raasta and Yeti said most restaurants planned a month in advance and so April had already been covered in the operation provisions. The announcement is, therefore, like ‘a bomb dropping’ on the industry, he claimed. Singh also questioned the logic behind the night curbs, wanting to know why food and beverage spaces — which have put in place the strictest hygiene protocols — were being targeted. Unlike last year when no one knew how to deal with the coronavirus, restaurateurs now clearly know what measures can check infection. So instead of penalising eateries, the authorities should, they said, enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour in public places, markets and public transport. Most restaurateurs also pressed for the focus to be on round-the-clock vaccination for everyone rather than economy-stultifying measures like a curfew. Amit Bagga, co-founder of Daryaganj, was worried that the decision would adversely impact his business, while Japtej Ahluwalia of Savya Rasa reiterated it was a setback for the struggling sector. Avantika Sinha Bahl of Mai Boa and Kampai and Zorawar Kalra of Massive Restaurants, who both opened new outlets in recent months, felt the ban on movement would undo the revival of the last few months. Kalra asserted that food delivery and takeaway could not sustain a restaurant, even if he agreed that the curfew was the need of the hour. A restaurateur disclosed that most outlets survived 2020 because they had financial reserves from 2019. Resuming business with installation of restrictions took a big financial toll on most restaurants, he said.

The order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority on Tuesday states that there shall be no restriction on interstate and intra-state transportation of essential and non-essential goods. It also states that no separate permission or e-pass will be required for such movements. Truckers, however, fear that they would still have to face problems.“Transportation work starts only at night and the godowns and warehouses are the places where loading and unloading are done at night. There was a lot of harassment by officials at the nakas during previous lockdowns,” said All India Motor Transport Congress secretary general Naveen Kumar Gupta.“People who are involved in managing essential items are equally important because the truckers will be able to only offload or get goods if they work. The truck itself is not just essential but the people who manage the process are as much essential,” said S P Singh, senior fellow of Indian Foundation of Transport Research and Training. “It takes half a dozen people for offloading or loading and many of these people don’t have IDs that certify that they are associated with this process,” Singh said. “Like truck movement, loading also starts at night.” AIMTC chief Kultaran Singh Atwal said, “The transporters fear the disarray will hamper the supply chain of the states.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/night-curbs-likely-to-pose-problems-say-transporters/articleshow/81938849.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The developers’ national body felt such restrictions till the end of month may lead to an exodus of workers from the state like last year’s.Credai national vice president Shantilal Kataria told TOI that they have requested the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to allow the offices of developers, contractors, architects and structural engineers to be kept open with 50% attendance like IT and ITes firms, lawyers and CAs. “Last year, there was a mass exodus of workers, and we fear there could be a repeat if the government does not relax the orders. It took almost 3-4 months before they returned,” Kataria said. He added shops selling cement and steel must be open for a few hours. Suhas Merchant, another national CREDAI member, said the industry must keep its offices running as part of site assistance or it will impact payment of workers and supply orders. “If we do don’t sell our flats how will we complete the sites and repay loans. Our office set up is related and dependent on our sites,” he said.In the Pune Municipal Corporation area, all construction sites and architect offices will be open from 7am to 6pm.NARDECO has said workers are being tested at their sites after they return from their hometown, he added. Other members the rules for vaccination and negative RT-PCR tests may be difficult for small developers and redevelopment projects to follow as they do not have a provision for onsite camps for workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/allow-workers-on-nearby-site-jobs-credai-to-state/articleshow/81938850.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Dalit scholar, poet pan Ambedkar committee||Mumbai: Two members of the state-backed committee to gather and streamline the unpublished writings of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar have written to the government, venting grievances about its composition. Noted Dalit ideologue J V Pawar has questioned the credentials of Krishna Kamble, who has been appointed member-secretary of the high-profile panel and will be helming the committee meetings. In a letter to higher education minister Uday Samant, Pawar said he was not willing to work under Kamble, whose credentials as Ambedkar researcher were dubious. “Not many members know about Kamble... In view of this, it would be humiliating for me to work as a committee member,” he said. On the other hand, noted Dalit poet Pradnya Pawar has regretted the inadequate representation of women researchers. In a letter to Samant, she pointed out that in view of Dr Ambedkar’s prolonged crusade to uplift women, the panel should have offered more seats to them. “I am the only woman in the 23-strong committee,” she pointed out. With the Maha Vikas Aghadi government passing through a rough patch, political observers said the coalition cannot afford to rub Dalit community leaders the wrong way. Ambedkar scholar Pawar has edited several volumes on the iconic Dalit movement, which altered the state’s socio-political narrative. “Not only is Kamble far junior to me in the field of Dalit studies, he hasn’t made any remarkable contribution to the subject,” Pawar, who has been researching Dr Ambedkar’s writings since 1970s, told TOI on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dalit-scholar-poet-pan-ambedkar-committee/articleshow/81940177.cms||Ambarish Mishra

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: War widow gets pension, after 72 years||PITHORAGARH: In the summer of 1952, when Paruli Devi was 12, her husband, a soldier in the Indian Army, killed himself. She never knew why. They had been married for just two months. Years went by. But a chance conversation about a woman in her village, a soldier’s widow like herself, finally getting pension sparked hope. And after a seven-year battle, Paruli, now 82, has been declared eligible as well. “It is not just about money. It is about recognition of my loss,” said Paruli Devi. Her husband, Gagan Singh, had joined the Army in 1946 as a soldier with the Kumaon Regiment. When he died, she was too young to know or understand what had disturbed her 20-year-old husband. “She made her way back from Lohakot village, where she had been setting up home with her husband, to Linthura village, where her brothers lived,” her nephew Kavendra Lunthi said. She never thought of bringing up her husband’s military service for compensation. “In Pithoragarh, where a lot of people enter military service, many don’t know their way around the pension system, especially widows of soldiers. So, after my retirement, I decided to help them,” said retired assistant treasury officer Dilip Singh Bhandari. One such woman he helped lived at Linthura. Paruli heard of her. This was in 2014. “She approached me with a question, ‘Am I eligible?’ I had to think about it.” It was a difficult case to begin with. It was very old. Her husband had not died fighting or at a posting. According to rules by the Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare, pension for death is given out when someone dies in service, or because of causes attributable to military service, or in war or counter-insurgency operations. And family pension is given in case of “natural death of the individual” at 30% of the last drawn pay. Gagan had not died of natural causes. “But in July 1977, a woman had in the Allahabad high court challenged the rule that only war widows were eligible for pension from the Army. In 1985, the judge had ruled in her favour,” said Bhandari. He remembered the case and cited it to back Paruli’s claim. “I took up her case with the Controller General of Defence Accounts, Allahabad, and the Kumaon Regiment Centre at Ranikhet. After seven years of correspondences and doing the rounds, the Kumaon Regiment Centre finally accepted Paruli Devi’s claim. “Her pension of Rs 11,700 starts now and she will get Rs 20 lakh as arrears accumulated since July, 1977,” Bhandari said. Paruli, after 70 years, has been recognised as a soldier’s widow: “I lived my whole life without official recognition. I am happy now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/70-yrs-after-soldier-husbands-death-ukhand-woman-82-to-get-pension/articleshow/81937852.cms||Prem Punetha

From setting up pickets to ensuring restaurants and clubs are closed on time, several teams will work on the ground. Those found travelling without a valid pass will be booked.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has ordered movement curbs from 10pm to 5am in view of rising cases of novel coronavirus infection and an order to that effect was issued on Tuesday, said Chinmoy Biswal, DCP, PRO. “Delhi Police will strictly enforce it except for the exempted categories mentioned in the order. All concerned should strictly observe the restrictions as given in the DDMA order,” he added.During the previous lockdown, Delhi Police had issued movement passes to facilitate movement of people engaged in essential services and commodities. “Fresh movement passes will be issued on demand. Those requiring and qualifying for it can also visit the Delhi Police website to apply for it. All field functionaries will be available in their jurisdictions to enforce the DDMA order and facilitate the exempted categories,” added Biswal.

---||Delhi||EWS students in turmoil over paid education||New Delhi: Gaurav and Vishal were promoted to Class IX for the 2021-22 academic session at St Thomas’ School in Dwarka. Their father, Jag Narayan, a mechanic, had been told even before the results were declared that the two boys would have to pay the full fees from now on or leave the school. The youngsters did not even know they had been studying for free under the economically weaker section (EWS) quota in private schools. The shock realisation for the family is that the benefit of free education under the Right to Education Act in non-government institutions extends only till Class VIII. Jag Narayan had no option but to sign an agreement with the school, promising to pay his sons’ tuition fees — Rs 16,740 per child per quarter. And while he may have braved the daunting task of mobilising funds to give his children a real chance at the future, the Qutub Vihar Goyla Dairy resident is surely going to struggle. Many others despairing parents in a similar situation have no alternative but to move their children to government institutions because schools built on private land are not legally bound to provide free education under RTE. Narayan approached the school twice, pleading that at least Gaurav be allowed to continue studying free. Rebuffed, the father said, “Gaurav is good in studies and I hoped he would be accommodated. When I admitted my sons to the school, I wasn’t aware of these clauses regarding government land and private land.” The school’s response was: “We would like to state that as in the past, our school continues to comply with the RTE Act, Delhi School Education Act and all other applicable laws. We have no further comment to make.” Gaurav, 15, confided to TOI, “I want to become a doctor but the nearest government school where I can study for free does not have a science stream.” His brother added, “They should have told our parents about this at the time of admission and maybe we would have studied in a government school. What will we tell our friends now — that we are poor and so have to attend another school?” A court hearing a petition demanding extension of the RTE Act benefit till Class XII has already been asked by the central government to dismiss the plea. Parents of over 150 EWS students at Hansraj Model School and NC Jindal Public School, both in Punjabi Bagh, have petitioned the chief minister and deputy CM on the matter, but haven’t got a response yet. After being promoted to Class IX in Hansraj Model School, Satyam Jha got a letter March 20 asking him to confirm his economic status. “My father is a driver for a transport company and cannot afford to pay so much for my education,” said a morose Jha, a student there since nursery. He, of course, learnt in Class V that he was not like his school mates but an EWS student when he had to drop his wish to attend cricket coaching after his parents told him they couldn’t afford the monthly Rs 500 this entailed. “I don't feel good about the situation. If I move to a government school, my friends will certainly mock me,” said the angst-ridden 14-year-old. Soni Singh too was told she couldn’t continue in NC Jindal Public School, where she has studied for over a decade. Her aggrieved mother, Suganti, who ekes out a living stitching clothes and now has to pay for both Soni and Yuvraj, who is in Class IX, ranted, “Is this what the Beti Padhao slogan we hear is all about?” Poonam, whose son studies in one of the institutions, alleged that some EWS students were barred from online classes. “Some kids were also removed from the class WhatsApp group,” the housewife added. “This harassment has mentally affected our children. Even those who didn’t know they were EWS beneficiaries now know and they feel humiliated. Most parents never tell their children that they are in the EWS category since this could lead to their being discriminated against in class. But that is precisely what we are facing now after so many years in the school.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ews-students-in-turmoil-over-paid-education/articleshow/81958938.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Don’t enforce blanket curbs, says Civil soc groups||Mumbai: Civil society groups and activists have appealed to CM Uddhav Thackeray not to enforce Covid-19 curbs in a blanket manner. In a joint letter sent by around 40 organisations to the CM, the activists have offered to collaborate with the government to find solutions for an effective response to the pandemic. Bilal Khan from the Working People’s Charter said the guidelines do not suggest any measures to tackle the hunger crisis or compensation for the loss of livelihood. Lara Jesani from the People’s Union for Civil Liberties said shutting down non-essential services will result in massive loss. “In our view, the restrictions should be put minimally and only as required, in areas that are most affected, and not in a blanket manner. Restrictions should be imposed as per trends and clinico-epidemiological profile of Covid-19 in the state. It would be more effective to adopt a decentralized approach, in consultation with communities,” they said. They have suggested waiver of documentary proof to give benefits of relief packages to poor neighbourhoods under lockdown. They have also sought adequate notice to ensure safe travel of migrant workers to their hometowns. Better healthcare access, vaccination awareness drives, 24-hour helpline to deal with the pandemic and lockdown-related issues are among other suggestions.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dont-enforce-blanket-curbs-says-civil-soc-groups/articleshow/81940144.cms||---
---||World||Global Covid toll crosses 3m amid infection resurgence||Coronavirus-related deaths worldwide crossed 3 million on Tuesday, according to a Reuters tally, as the latest global resurgence of Covid-19 infections is challenging vaccination efforts across the globe. Worldwide Covid-19 deaths are rising once again, especially in Brazil and India. Health officials blame more infectious variants that were first detected in the United Kingdom and South Africa, along with public fatigue with lockdowns and other restrictions. According to a Reuters tally, it took more than a year for the global coronavirus death toll to reach 2 million. The next 1 million deaths were added in about three months. Brazil is leading the world in the daily average number of new deaths reported and accounts for one in every four deaths worldwide each day, according to a Reuters analysis. The World Health Organization acknowledged the nation's dire condition due to coronavirus, saying the country is in a very critical condition with an overwhelmed healthcare system. "Indeed there is a very serious situation going on in Brazil right now, where we have a number of states in critical condition," WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove told a briefing last Thursday, adding that many hospital intensive care units are more than 90% full. India reported a record rise in Covid-19 infections on Monday, becoming the second nation after the United States to post more than 100,000 new cases in a day. India's worst-affected state, Maharashtra on Monday began shutting shopping malls, cinemas, bars, restaurants, and places of worship, as hospitals are being overrun by patients. The European region, which includes 51 countries, has the highest total number of deaths at nearly 1.1 million. Five European countries including the United Kingdom, Russia, France, Italy and Germany constitute about 60% of Europe's total coronavirus-related deaths. The United States has the highest number of deaths of any country at the world at 555,000 and accounts for about 19% of all deaths due to Covid-19 in the world. Cases have risen for the last three weeks but health officials believe the nation's rapid vaccination campaign may prevent a rise in deaths. A third of the population has received at least one dose of a vaccine. At least 370.3 million people or nearly 4.75% of the global population have received a single dose of Covid-19 vaccine by Sunday, according to latest figures from research and data provider firm Our World in Data. However, the World Health Organization is urging countries to donate more doses of approved Covid-19 vaccines to help meet vaccination targets for the most vulnerable in poorer countries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/global-covid-toll-crosses-3m-amid-infection-resurgence/articleshow/81942369.cms||---

Many other octogenarians and nonagenarians also visited nearby polling booths to vote.Ninety-two-year old S Krishnammal from Ramanathapuram in the city is one among them. She travelled to the corporation school at Puliyakulam along with her relatives to cast her vote.She has been exercising her franchise since the first general election in 1952 and never missed any elections. Her late husband was a military man. She believes she has to choose the right person to power. Wanting to enjoy the moments of getting inked on her forefinger and pressing the symbol of her candidate/party in the ballot unit, she refused to accept the special postal ballot option, even though officials had insisted her to opt for it because of her age.“I recovered from coronavirus two months ago. A few days ago, I hurt my back after falling at my home. Despite the pain, I want to visit the polling station to cast my vote because it is important for me and I want to experience the environment again,” she said.Pappamal said, “People ask me why I strain myself at this age to cast my vote. But voting to elect the candidate of my choice is my right. Why should I waste this opportunity or allow someone to misuse it.”I used to visit a polling station with my husband when he was alive, she said. “After all, this could be my last election and why should I forego my decades’ old tradition.”Explaining that he had seen many of the great leaders throughout his life, Marappa Gounder requested youngsters to cast their votes without fail to choose the right person to rule them.Similarly, M Murugan, 57, of Sowripalayam, a disabled person, visited the polling station with a walker after rejecting the special postal ballot option. He said, “I had never missed any election except the 2016 polls, when I was hospitalized, in my life and I don’t want my disability to be a hurdle for excising my rights. After all, I step out of my house only for such important things,” he said.Another disabled person, N Santhanalakshmi, 58, from Selvapuram, said she had applied for the postal ballot and submitted 12D forms to the officials. As officials did not visit her house with the ballots, she had to visit the booth in person to cast her vote. “I don’t know why they did not visit me after I submitted the form. But, no matter what, I will cast my vote.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/elderly-people-set-examples-to-youth-in-exercising-their-democratic-right/articleshow/81940175.cms||Nivedha Selvam

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Infectivity of current strains high||HYDERABAD: The infectivity of Covid-19 virus strains currently prevalent in the state is much high compared to the ones last year, going by ground reports. In the latest findings, hospitals treating Covid-19 patients are recording multiple people within the same family getting affected by the virus. “We are getting requests from several family members of patients admitted here to take them in as well. We currently have 150 critical patients and almost all of them have family members who are infected as well. In some cases, they are only mildly infected but there are two or more family members of almost all these patients who are currently positive. This shows that the positivity rate is very high,” said Dr M Raja Rao, superintendent, Gandhi hospital. In fact, health authorities, too, have sounded an alert on the high infectivity during the current wave of the virus. “The current strains’ circulation seem to be more infectious, although its not more severe. So, overall, the morbidity is expected to be much more,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director public health, Telangana state, urging people to step up Covid-appropriate behaviour. High morbidity meanwhile means a higher number of hospital admissions and overall pressure on the healthcare infrastructure. “The most essential aspect right now is to wear masks, maintain social distance and get vaccinated. Vaccine will be a protection from the virus in case of an infection. Everyone who falls in the category of beneficiaries, should take the vaccine. This is the only way to cut the chain of spread,” said the official. When a large chunk of the population is vaccinated, the spread of the virus will be contained, say experts. While vaccination is essential, especially with a massive jump in numbers likely to continue over the next one month, wearing masks is also equally important. “Whether vaccinated or not, people need to wear masks when going out. Masks can cut down the chances of infection to a large extent if they are worn correctly. The masks should fit properly and should be handled properly while wearing and removing,” said Dr P Raghu Ram, director Kims-Ushalakshmi Institute of Breast Diseases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/infectivity-of-current-strains-high/articleshow/81938872.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Hyderabad||AIMIM to fight from only 7 seats in West Bengal||HYDERABAD: Contrary to the expectations that it will foray into West Bengal assembly elections in a big way and field its candidates in about 40 to 50 seats, the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) has decided to contest in only seven assembly constituencies. Party chief and MP Asaduddin Owaisi, who had announced earlier that they would make a mark in West Bengal elections, on Tuesday announced party candidates for only seven seats. Mofakkerul Islam (Itahar), Aslokaut Jaman (Jalangi), Nur Mahabub Alam (Sagardighi), Sajjad Hossain (Bharatpur), Maulana Moti-ur-Rahman (Malatipur), Sayeed-ur-Rahman (Ratua) and Danish (Asansol North) would fight the electoral battle on behalf of the party. These constituencies would be going for polls in the last phase. Sources added that the Muslim population is between 60% and 75% on the seven seats. The AIMIM had contested from 20 seats in Bihar assembly elections held in 2020 and secured five seats. The party had also entered the fray from 44 seats in Maharashtra assembly elections in 2019 and won two seats. In West Bengal too, there were expectations that it would field many candidates, especially where the Muslim population and voters are more. AIMIM sources said in 57 assembly constituencies, Muslim voter share is more than 50 per cent and in another 121 segments, Muslim voters are over 30 per cent. “We have decided to contest only in seven seats after assessing the party strength and where we got strong candidates. Our party does not want to field candidates for name sake or number sake. In these seven constituencies, party cadre have been working tirelessly since 2016,” a senior member of AIMIM told TOI on Tuesday. There was a speculation that the AIMIM would also join hands with Abbas Siddiqui-led Indian Secular Front (ISF), which later tied up with the Congress and the Left to form a bigger alliance without AMIM. While the ISF has fielded candidates in 24 assembly segments, 12 candidates are Hindus and the rest 12 are Muslim candidates. However, the AIMIM stayed away from the ISF as it has an alliance with Congress. “The new front founder Siddiqui’s uncle is still with the TMC and the ISF’s ideology is different. We don’t want to align with the ISF,” the AIMIM leader added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mim-to-enter-wb-poll-fray-from-7-seats/articleshow/81938874.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Nagpur||Furious traders keep shops open as new curbs kick in||Nagpur: Day one of the 25-day lockdown resembled any routine day with a stream of vehicles on the streets and markets teeming with people on Tuesday. Traders in some parts of Nagpur city staged protests against the new restrictions imposed by the state government and the Nagpur Municipal Corporation in view of the surging Covid-19 cases. “We can no longer survive if business activities are suspended,” shopkeepers told the administration on Tuesday. Some said that the ‘partial restrictive measures’ or ‘stricter curbs’ were nothing short of a complete lockdown and a wordplay by the government. The traders’ protest was more pronounced in the commercial pockets of the city including Itwari, Mominpura, Sitabuldi, Jaripatka among others. The police had a tough time to convince the agitated shopkeepers to shut shops in view of the lockdown order. Tehsil police took action against two shopkeepers under section 188 of the IPC for keeping their shops opened. Unlike previous restrictions imposed last year and in March, market areas were abuzz with shopkeepers and their staff gathered outside their shops. Roads too witnessed regular traffic and streets in Itwari, Mominpura, Mahal witnessed the usual traffic jam. On Monday, NMC had replicated the state government’s announcement of a partial lockdown from 8pm from Monday till April 30, with complete shutdown on weekends, stricter night curfew and prohibition of assembly of more than five people during daytime. As part of the enforcement of the order, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B directed shops and establishments dealing in non-essential commodities, restaurants, eateries, malls, theatres, multiplexes and religious places to remain shut till April 30. Shopkeepers from Itwari, Mominpura and Sitabuldi areas staged demonstrations and also indulged in heated arguments with the police over the lockdown. “We had been cooperating with the administration since last year. This lockdown is unacceptable as only non-essential shops were once again targeted as if we are responsible for surge in Covid-19 cases,” said Madhur Jain a readymade garment shopkeeper from Itwari. DCP Lohit Matani, senior inspector Jayesh Bhandarkar along with assistant municipal commissioner Ashok Patil had a tough time convincing the shopkeepers to obey the ‘partial lockdown’ order. Sensing trouble, additional police force including rapid action force too were called in Itwari area. Shopkeepers shut shops after being warned of action. We understand that the rising Covid cases was a matter of concern for both the administration and people and also understand the need for remedial measures. But we have already faced huge losses during the lockdown and the restrictions imposed in subsequent months. Weekends are the time when we get to earn. If we remain shut we will face a difficult situation in paying staff salary, rent, bills and taxes, miffed shopkeepers said. Traders from Mominpura called the ‘partial lockdown’ discriminatory. They wanted blanket closure of all business activities or none. “If we can keep our shops open, we can earn bread and our employees get their wage,” said Rafique Aziz, a shopkeeper from Mominpura. Apart from traders, a delegation of hawkers from Sitabuldi Hawkers Welfare Association led by its president Gopichand Ambhore also met deputy commissioner of police Vanita Sahu. Sanjay Tabootwala of Nagpur district general merchant association said if these curbs keep on compelling us to suspend business, then businessmen would be finished off. Similarly, Ashok Sanghvi of Chamber of Association of Maharashtra industry and trade said from where businessmen will bring money to pay taxes. Daulat Kungwani and Thakurdas Jethwani of Jaripatka Dukandar Sangh said if some relaxations are not provided the non-essential traders will face huge losses. TOI also spotted rampant violations by autorickshaw and four-wheeler drivers — autorickshaws were seen carrying more than two passengers, while four-wheelers flouted the 50% passenger cap. However, Aapli buses were seen plying with 50% capacity during the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/furious-traders-keep-shops-open-as-new-curbs-kick-in/articleshow/81938879.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

It’s big enough to propel Gujarat into the list of top 10 Indian states with highest active cases as of Tuesday evening. The state surpassed Delhi (17,332) to claim the ninth position with 17,348 cases. However, there is a major gap between Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh on No 8 which has 24,155 active cases. In terms of percentage of active cases, however, Gujarat ranks fifth among these 10 states with 5.3%. Maharashtra topped the list with15.2%, followed by Chhattisgarh (13.6%), Punjab (10.1%), and Madhya Pradesh (7.7%). “Active cases are defined as difference between total cases and combination of discharged and deceased patients. From December to March, discharge rate had climbed up to 96%. But skyrocketing cases, and dip in discharges has resulted in high active cases,” said an epidemiologist, adding that more days of hospitalization can increase bed occupancy. State health department data revealed that Surat district had the highest active cases at 4,037 followed by 2,940 in Ahmedabad, 2,617 in Vadodara and 1,869 in Rajkot. The four districts account for 66% or two-thirds of Gujarat’s total active cases. Nine of 33 districts have active Covid-19 cases in double digits. The lowest active cases were in Porbandar at 4. Dangs, which earlier had the lowest total and active cases, had 48 cases as of Tuesday. “The surge is often attributed to the new strain.s Longer recovery period can increase the active cases count,” added the epidemiologist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-records-highest-active-cases/articleshow/81938899.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Nagpur||Allow home delivery of liquor: Bar, shop owners||Nagpur: The Nagpur District Permit Room Owners’ Association — a body of wine shop and bar room owners — has urged state chief secretary demanding that home delivery of liquor should be allowed during the lockdown. The lockdown order for Nagpur district that was released late in the evening gave them little time to prepare, says the association. Both the wine shops and bars are now left with a substantial inventory of beer that was purchased for the coming summer season. The association claims its members are staring at losses on account of unsold beer stock, which has a shorter shelf life as compared to other drinks. The types of beer that are generally sold don’t have a shelf life of more than three months, for some it’s barely 15 days. “Going by the chief minister’s speech, the traders were under an impression that there will not be a complete lockdown. However, when local authorities came up with an order, it covered restaurants, bars and wine shops also. The sudden move has left the traders in a difficult situation,” said Rajeev Jaiswal, president of the association. Moreover, bars and restaurants have also ended up spending much on buying other items like cold drinks and raw material for food stuff apart from liquor, he said. Jaiswal said there are 850 permit rooms in the district out of which around 400 are in the city. Apart from this, there are 120 wine shops in the city alone. The owners have already ended up paying hefty licence renewal fees. A complete ban on selling liquor would only mean heavy losses for them, he added. He stressed that there should be a uniform implementation throughout the state. In Vidarbha, home delivery is allowed in Washim. There are no curbs in other districts like Jalgaon, Bhusawal, Sangli, Osmanabad and Latur, he pointed out. Raja Bose, who runs M/s Kings Wine Shop, said the licence fees range go up to Rs10 lakh. A number of shop and bar owners have borrowed money to pay the fees. Had the ban been in the offing, the government should have allowed some relaxation in the fees, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/allow-home-delivery-of-liquor-bar-shop-owners/articleshow/81938891.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Man abandoned by sons in forest||HYDERABAD: Two sons banished their father into the forest as they felt he had become a burden to them and their families. They took their 62-year-old father Swamy on a vehicle, led him into the forest area in Anantagiri in Vikarabad district and abandoned him there. The sons hoped their father will never be able to return, but a good samaritan lent a helping hand to the man in distress. Vikarabad police intervened, traced the man’s family in Narsingi near the city and handed him over to his sons. “We counselled the sons and Swamy was left at their house on Monday night,” Vikarabad police said. Swamy hails from Pultur village of Alampur mandal in Jogulamba Gadwal district. He owns one acre of land in the village and built a house for his family in Narsingi. The sons and the daughters-in-law who were allegedly vexed with him had decided that he should not be in the house. They took him to the forest area and left him there five days ago, assuming that they had seen the last of him. Hurt as he was, Swamy was able to make his way out of the forest area. According to police, he stayed near a temple for some time. From the Anantagiri forest area, he made his way to Vikarabad. Seeing his haggard look, good samaritan Mohammed Ghouse took pity on him. He also gave him food to eat for a couple of days. On learning about his condition, he reportedly informed police about Swamy. Vikarabad police said the man has been left in the care of his sons who were counselled against ill-treating their father. When contacted, Narsingi police sub-inspector Balram said they would visit the family and find out details about Swamy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/man-abandoned-by-sons-in-forest/articleshow/81938883.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The victim suffered injuries on her head and hands after she jumped off the moving vehicle. The accused, Aniket Jaiswal, 21, and Surajkumar Rajbhar, 24, were tracked with the help of a sketch made based on the victim’s description. Jaiswal, who had been arrested in February 2020 for molesting a minor, was out on bail. The incident occurred on March 7 afternoon when the Kandivli resident took a shared rickshaw from Gundavali bus depot at Azad Nagar, Andheri (east). “I was heading towards the bus depot when the auto driver halted nearby. I agreed to travel on seat-sharing basis when the driver told me the passenger already seated was headed towards Kandivli. When the auto reached Western Express highway, the passenger started touching me inappropriately. I asked the driver to stop but he didn’t. Suddenly, the driver stopped the auto and sat next to me, while the passenger started driving. I jumped off the auto near Jogeshwari (east),” the victim has stated in her complaint. Locals took the victim to a hospital nearby and called the police. Based on the complaint, DCP Maheshwar Reddy supervised a team led by Andheri police senior inspector Vijay Belge. The woman, who was traumatised by the incident, was provided counselling too. “Nearly 30-40 autorickshaw drivers were questioned. One of them identified Jaiswal whose arrest led to Rajbhar. It was learnt that Samta Nagar police in Kandivali had arrested Jaiswal last year under the Pocso Act for molesting a minor girl. In September, the court released him on bail due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” said assistant police inspector, Ganesh Pisal. The duo has been booked under the Indian Penal Code sections 34 (common intention), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety) and 354 (outraging modesty). They will be produced before the Andheri court on Wednesday.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Two criminals shot at, nabbed in separate operations within 24 hrs||NEW DELHI: Two notorious criminals, who were involved in dozens of snatching, extortion and robbery cases, were nabbed after being shot in their legs by police in separate operations within a span of 24 hours. Both are stated to be out of danger. In the first case, Pravesh (26) was shot at by cops from Rohini district in Begumpur. He had been arrested on Monday morning. He tried to escape in the evening while returning after helping police arrest his associate, Naveen. Three semi-automatic pistols were seized during the raid. DCP (Rohini) Pranav Tayal said, “When the police team reached near a helipad in the area, Pravesh complained of motion sickness and said he was going to throw up. He was let out and as soon as he bent to puke, he snatched a pistol from a policeman’s holster and fired a shot in a bid to escape. However, another cop shot him in the leg and Pravesh fell down. He was taken to Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital and admitted there for treatment.” The duo was tracked after a complaint from a trader alleging extortion of Rs 5 lakh. Pravesh was arrested on April 5. During interrogation, they disclosed that they had committed robbery at the complainant’s shop a few months ago. They targeted him again by making an extortion call. They were planning to set his house on fire to scare him into paying the money. They had also committed several snatchings in the area. In the second operation, a criminal with 39 snatching cases lodged against him was shot in his right leg in Seemapuri of Shahdara district on Monday night. DCP Sathiyasundaram said the accused, Ehsan (31), is a resident of Trilokpuri in east Delhi. Police are looking for his associate. The two criminals were caught on camera robbing a man at gunpoint in Shahdara in March. One of them was also seen getting into a scuffle with the victim. Later, the footage went viral on social media. After registering a case, police activated their informers and came to know that Ehsan and his aide were behind many such crimes in the area. Surveillance was mounted and a trap was laid in Seemapuri after cops received a tip-off about Ehsan’s movements. He was spotted and flagged down, but he shot at the police team. In retaliatory firing, he got hit in his right leg. He was taken to GTB Hospital for treatment. A pistol, cartridges and a stolen bike were seized from him. He was found involved in cases of robbery, snatching, attempted murder, assault, possession of illegal weapons and burglary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/two-criminals-shot-at-nabbed-in-separate-operations-within-24-hrs/articleshow/81938902.cms||---

The orders were given to officials at a video conference that lasted for over two hours. The chief secretary issued numerous instructions covering the entire scope of Covid-19 management including testing, tracing, treatment, vaccination and enforcement of appropriate behaviour. Urging district collectors to ramp up the pace of vaccination, the chief secretary said, “The Government Covid Vaccination Centres (GCVCs) have been opened down to the Primary Health Care (PHC) level increasing the number of GCVCs from 142 to over 1,000. See to it that people were made aware of the locations of the GCVCs.” He fixed per day performance benchmarks for all GCVCs with a minimum of 100 vaccinations at PHCs, 200 at area hospitals or community health centres and 300 at district or government general hospitals to ensure the daily vaccinations exceed 1.25 lakh a day from the present 50,000. He also asked authorities to double number of tests. “Only early identification and isolation will help in controlling the spread of disease,” he said. Kumar stressed importance of not letting the pace of testing come down even on weekends and holidays.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-to-ramp-up-testing-vaccination-as-cases-spiral/articleshow/81938886.cms||---

By Sunday evening, around 75 societies across the city with 6,900 individuals registered for the scheme. Most of the societies were in the western part of the city like Gota, Ghatlodia, Bodakdev, and Navrangpura.

The most important part of the investigation is analysis of the black box of the ship which is called ‘voyage data recorder’. The master was asked for access to the VDR and it was provided. Suez Canal Authority (SCA) chairman Osama Rabie said on April 6 that the VDR was being examined. The 25 Indian crew and master of the giant ship will continue to remain on board the ship ‘for the time being’, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM), the company which is the technical manager of the ship, has said. The ship ran aground on March 23, bringing a major artery of international shipping to a standstill for almost a week. It was refloated by a flotilla of tugs on March 29. It then arrived at the Great Bitter Lake which is also part of the SCA for an investigation to find out the causes for the mishap. “All crew members are in good health and remain safely onboard for the time being to assist with ongoing investigations carried out by investigators from the SCA, UK P&I Club and BSM’s technical team,” a spokesperson of Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement informed TOI. Panamanian authorities are also conducting an investigation as the vessel is registered in Panama. “BSM is committed to cooperating with all investigations into the grounding,” the spokesperson said. On being asked for the identities of the master of the ship and the crew, the spokesperson said: “BSM will not be releasing personal information of the crew for privacy reasons.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/suez-canal-block-ensure-indian-crew-not-harassed-union-tells-shipping-dg/articleshow/81938884.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Nagpur||Rly TTEs turning Covid positive, concerns over lack of checks on passengers||Nagpur: With nearly 50 train ticket checking staff from both South East Central Railway (SECR) and Central Railway (CR) testing positive for Covid-19, passengers and even staff have raised concern whether infected passengers are taking to travel? Barring thermal scanning of passengers at stations, there are no checks of passengers nor any RT-PCR negative report is sought on the lines of air travellers, from passengers coming to the city or moving out from Nagpur. In a complaint to railway ministry and general manager, Central Railway, Zonal Railway Users’ Consultative Committee (ZRUCC) member Chandrashekhar Bisen has said, “As per Covid-19 protocol, passengers with only confirmed tickets should be allowed in the trains. However, as a regular traveller to Mumbai, I’ve been observing many unreserved and waitlisted passengers are also boarding trains and their excess fare tickets (EFTs) are being issued.” “By allowing passengers without stringent checks, the safety of ticket checking staff is at stake. A chief ticket inspector (CTI) of Central Railway died of Covid-19 two days ago. Last month, an SECR TTE boarded CSMT-Howrah Mail and reported symptoms and tested positive on return. He must have come in contact with Covid-19 passengers during checking. This way it will be impossible to control the spread of Covid-19,” said Bisen. “The senior officials are sending flying squads aboard trains to collect fines from passengers travelling without tickets. This may be to achieve revenue targets but the issue is when unconfirmed passengers are not allowed, how are they gaining entry inside the station,” asks Bisen. However, Central Railway spokesperson and ACM SG Rao said, “Unconfirmed passengers are allowed. Most of the ticket checking staff have been vaccinated. We are conducting checks in trains and fine is collected from without ticket passengers as per rules. Passengers are duly scanned at the entrance before allowing them inside. It is wrong to say stringent checks are not being done.” Bisen alleged recently many frontline railway employees were found to be corona positive. Some lost their lives while working. Yet, it is observed that Central Railway and SECR are deploying ticket checking staff aboard the train but they don’t know whether they are coming in contact with Covid-19 passengers. Senior officers are deploying ticket checking staff, making the TTEs vulnerable to Covid-19 positive passengers. Bisen demanded that on the lines of air passengers, the railway should make sure RT-PCR test is done 72 hours before travel by passengers. There is huge resentment among the ticket checking staff and their family members, who are facing problems due to fear of getting infected. “The ticket checking staff is seen collecting fine from unreserved passengers at the station and allowing them to board the trains. Most of the TTEs say the administration has set a huge daily target. This eventually allows every passenger to travel aboard trains. As no RT-PCR certificate is sought, we don’t know who is Covid-19 positive and negative. This is causing huge problems, especially when getting beds and treatment is difficult,” said Bisen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rly-ttes-turning-covid-positive-concerns-over-lack-of-checks-on-passengers/articleshow/81938917.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

For ration and other essentials, shops were permitted to open from 6am to 10 am. According to former sarpanch Makula Ravinder a 75-year-old woman passed away under normal circumstances on March 29. Attending her funeral were a large number of people, including many from Hyderabad. “The number of cases jumped since the funeral. After a few people tested positive, others too were asked to get tested and many primary contacts told to stay under home isolation,” said Ravinder. Health officials rushed to the village and carried out rapid antigen tests. Every day the number of cases are rising, said sources. On record, medical officer Dr Shailaja said only 36 people had tested positive and they had been asked to isolate themselves. However, villagers differed on the numbers saying the figure could be much higher. According to village elder, Sadineni Sarangapani, many people were not coming forward to get tested. The village falls under the Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation under the Kazipet mandal. Seeking to reassure people, Dr Shailaja said the situation was under control. “We are monitoring patients regularly in home isolation. If needed, a team of medical experts will reach out to them and send them to Covid care centre in Kazipet.” One person, a 45-year-old passed away after testing positive on Monday, but the officials said he refused to be admitted in the Covid care centre.

Dharmadev, resident of Thekaha village in Chandauli district, was one of the brave security personnel who were martyred in Chhattisgarh while fighting the Naxalites on April 3. A pall of gloom descended on the villagers when his body reached his native village. The family members were in a state of shock when they got the information of his demise in the fight. His younger brother Dhananjay Kumar is also in CRPF, while his father Ramasare Gupta runs a shop. Dharmdev is survived by his wife Meena Devi and two daughters Jyoti (11) and Sakshi (4).

The move will enable Kaleshwaram project water reach Manjeera and up to Nizamsagar to provide irrigation facilities to thousands of acres and drinking water to several villages. Senior irrigation officials termed it as another milestone in the Kaleshwaram project’s fruits reaching various parts of the state. KCR reached Avusulapally in a bus in the morning and offered puja to Kaleshwaram waters. He released 1,600 cusecs of water from Kondapochamma reservoir. The water from Sangareddy canal through Haldivagu will reach Nizamsagar. Officials said the water will reach Nizamsagar in next eight to 10 days. The water will reach Nizamsagar after a 96-km journey from Haldivagu after joining Godavari river’s tributaries - Manjeera and Haridhara.“With this, 32 check dams en route from Haldivagu to Nizamsagar will be filled providing irrigation and drinking water facilities,” a senior official said. This would protect paddy in over 14,000 acres in the erstwhile Medak district, he said. Finance minister T Harish Rao, Medak MP Kotha Prabhakar Reddy, irrigation principal secretary Rajat Kumar and elected representatives were present. Later, the CM reached Pamulaparthy village in Markook mandal, performed puja before releasing Kaleshwaram waters into Gajwel canal. These waters will fill up 20 tanks like Pamulaparthy, Pathuru, Chebarthi, Pragnapur, Gajwel, Kesaram, Bayyaram and Jaliyama.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cm-releases-kaleshwaram-water-into-haldivagu/articleshow/81938914.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Lamington Road restive as shops shut amid laptop boom||MUMBAI: The restive traders on Lamington Road in south Mumbai confront the ultimate irony: Work-from-home booms once again with the state’s lockdown-style curbs, but their electronics and computer hardware shops are shut. “This should be our time to sell laptops, routers and computer parts. But the gains will now go to e-commerce platforms,” said Ravi Bohra of Libra Infotech. “They offer cheaper deals and the laptop comes home,” he added bitterly. On the first day of the ‘mini-lockdown’, scores of traders opened their shops, unaware the rules had kicked in. But with the police shutting them down, they stuck notices with their contact numbers outside their shops and stood huddled in silent fury. Lamington Road has over 1,200 shops dealing with computer peripherals, electronic goods, sound, television equipment and even medical equipment hardware. Tushar Jain, who set up Nax Infotax shortly before the lockdown last year, has faced nothing but losses. “I had no time to break even. As soon as I set up, I had to pay monthly rent of Rs 1.35 lakh and employee salaries worth Rs 1 lakh,” he said. After October 2020, sales start-ed looking up, but now there is another speed-breaker. “There are two kinds of injustice that we can see in the closure of shops,” said Mitesh Mody, president of the All India Electronics Association. “One is that the government is allow-ing e-commerce platforms to get the better of retailers, and the other is that Make in India is facing a setback. Indian manufacturers of LED televisions who sell through retail shops are at a disadvantage compared to international brands who se-ll via e-commerce platforms.” The 87-year old Hotel Vasant Bhuvan in the locality is also struggling for customers. “We are only allowed to do home delivery, but how many people will order now that the shops are closed?” asked owner Rajesh Yadav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lamington-road-restive-as-shops-shut-amid-laptop-boom/articleshow/81940264.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar
---||Hyderabad||Private schools, Telangana govt face-off over SSC exam centres||HYDERABAD: With the state failing to release the academic schedule for class 1 to class 8 students for the academic year 2020-21, private budget school managements are threatening to back off from handing over their campuses as exam centres to conduct SSC or Intermediate examinations. The Telangana Recognised School Management Association (TRSMA), which has about 10, 000 schools as its members, said that unless the state releases an academic schedule and decides to conduct examinations for class 1 to class 9 students, they won’t be cooperating with the state government. “Why should we cooperate with the government when they are least bothered about private schools and their staff. We will lock all our campuses and will not give them for the conduct of examinations,” said Shekhar Rao Y, president, TRSMA. This year, to conduct SSC exams, following all Covid-19 norms, the number of exam centres and classrooms needs to be doubled. “As per the norms, only one student will be seated per bench, and in a room, there will be hardly 11 to 12 students. To accommodate all students, we need to take extra rooms in centres or have to add new centres,” said A Satyanarayana Reddy, director, government examinations, adding that they would need about 5,000 exam centres to conduct SSC examinations. Speaking to TOI, Reddy said that apart from using government and private schools, they will also be using government and private junior colleges to conduct SSC exams. “Private managements have no option except to follow the orders of the state. They have no right to say that they won’t let us use their campuses as exam centres,” said Reddy. The management, meanwhile, said that these are dire circumstances and added that as the question is about the survival of private budget colleges, they would not hesitate to go to any extent. This year, even to conduct Inter exams, the Board of Intermediate Education is planning to utilize schools as well as junior colleges as centres. Inter exams are to be held from May 1, SSC exams will begin on May 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pvt-schools-govt-face-off-over-ssc-exam-centres/articleshow/81943852.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Pune||Industrial workers with ID cards, company letters can commute: Pune & Pimpri Chinchwad police chiefs||PUNE: The police commissioners of Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad on Tuesday said workers carrying valid company-issued identity cards or authorization letters would be allowed to travel to and from their workplaces in industrial zones. Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta and his Pimpri Chinchwad counterpart Krishna Prakash made the assurance during an online interaction with industrial representatives regarding the restrictions, most of which will come into effect from April 30. Tuesday’s interaction was organised by the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture (MCCIA), and was attended by hundreds from various industrial units in and around the Pune region. Also part of the interaction was Sadashiv Survase, the state’s joint director of industries. “I want to reiterate that the police have no objections to employees headed to and from their shifts in factories, as long as they show valid identity cards or authorization letters from their workplaces, and can justify their travel,” Gupta said. He further said the police would be stressing on self-compliance of guidelines, “and not on filing cases”. Pimpri Chinchwad commissioner Prakash too laid emphasis on “self-discipline” and assured that people within his commissionerate’s jurisdiction would be allowed to their workplace — provided they were exempt. He also said those from adjacent municipal areas, like Pune, can also travel subject to possession of valid ID cards. For his part, Survase assured that a solution would soon be worked out for the RT-PCR test requirement for companies’ on-site staff, which has been among the chief complaints of industrial representatives. “The micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector has expressed difficulties in carrying out fortnightly RT-PCR tests due to various reasons, and we think testing can be staggered to ease the pressure on the local infrastructure. The industries exempted have also asked that their city offices be allowed to open as they are essential for export operations. A circular will soon be issued in that regard,” Survase said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/industrial-workers-with-id-cards-company-letters-can-commute-police-chiefs/articleshow/81938927.cms||---

The number of active cases increased to 396, highest in the past six months. Following an increase in the number of Covid-19 cases, the demand for oxygen increased two times in Agra region. The average requirement for medical oxygen in the district is 10 tonnes. However, the demand for oxygen doubled in the past week. The situation is similar in the nearby districts. According to the health department officials, the current requirement of oxygen in UP is 200 to 250 tonnes and the production is around 220 tonnes. Further increase in the cases would lead to shortage of oxygen. Drug department officials are making efforts to ensure manufacturers in UP do not supply oxygen to other states. IMA Agra district president Dr Ravi Mohan Pachori said, “Following the increase in Covid-19 cases, the demand for medical oxygen has doubled since past one week. We have updated the district administration about the situation. For now, the situation is under control. Hospitals have been asked to ensure minimum usage of oxygen and extensive use of oxygen concentrator.” Chief medical officer, Agra district, Dr RC Pandey said, “There is no shortage of oxygen supply at the government centres. We are working to ensure private hospitals and nursing homes do not suffer from shortage of oxygen. Drug department has been directed to prepare a list of suppliers and communicate with them so that there is no demand and supply crisis.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-reports-82-cases-in-a-day-demand-for-oxygen-increases-two-times/articleshow/81937116.cms||---
---||Nagpur||2,800 rail passengers entering city after mere thermal scan||NAGPUR: About 2,800 passengers coming to the city in 22 trains every day are from the five most affected states — Delhi-NCR, Kerala, Gujarat, Goa and Rajasthan. After a mere formality of thermal scanning, they are joining the local population in the city where the administration and police are struggling to enforce restrictions. In the past, passengers coming in trains from the five affected states were being scanned by a joint team of railways and Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) who also conducted rapid antigen tests of the symptomatic ones. The screening of passengers had simultaneously started in the railways, airports and the state borders following an order from the state government in November last year. Later, the order got diluted as the state government did not follow up on the same front in the subsequent guidelines. Apart from the airports, the screening systems in the railways and on roads had reduced to mere formalities. It’s learnt that many passengers in trains resort to trickery of consuming paracetamol tablets to conceal symptoms. Around a fortnight ago, NMC had withdrawn its manpower from the railway station to concentrate on the ongoing vaccine and testing drives. At present, the medical team of railways are conducting thermal scanning. CS Rao, assistant commercial manager of Central railway, who also holds the charge of public relations, said, “If any passenger is found symptomatic by our team, then they are referred to the medical authorities concerned. We have only one entry and exit on either side where the passengers are scanned by the railway team,” he said. Munucupal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said he intends to take up the issue of effective screening of epassengers with the railway authorities (divisional railway manager) at the earliest and also contemplate giving them rapid antigen test kits. “We had started screening of railway passengers but had to re-direct manpower for other priorities. But, railway authorities can be always requested to make the exercise fruitful,” he said. Sources in Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) said though the services to-and-from Madhya Pradesh have been suspended, two buses from Hyderabad and another five from Adilabad are operating. A few mor are operating to-and-from Rajnandgaon and Raipur in Chhattisgarh. Sources said around 600 trips of buses with full seating capacity are under way from the four cities and equal numbers of depots in rural districts ferrying around 30,000 passengers. “Though no standing is allowed, the passengers can still beside each other. We try to remind them to wear masks and use sanitizers repeatedly,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2-8k-rail-passengers-entering-city-after-mere-thermal-scan/articleshow/81938933.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Hyderabad||Couple files complaint after apartment association president threatens to kill pet in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: A couple residing in an apartment at Bhagya Nagar Colony in Kukatpally filed a police complaint at the KPHB police station against the president of the apartment association after he threatened the couple for keeping a pet dog in their apartment. According to the pet owner Avi Menon, the incident took place on April 2 when they were taking their dog out for a walk. “This person who claims to be the president of the apartment started yelling at us saying that we cannot enter our own house if we have a pet,” said Menon. In a video recording of the argument, the president of the apartment was seen threatening the couple saying that he would get a licensed gun, which is allegedly used to kill monkeys. The couple moved into the flat in December 2020 after their marriage. Prior to that, the flat was owned by the parents of the wife since 1998. “We had Milo ever since we moved in, but the president never noticed it. We went to file a complaint with the police after he threatened us but nothing much has happened on that front. The police just shared their patrolling van number and asked me to call them if something happens. Even this morning (Tuesday morning), I got a call from the station asking me free the apartment president of all the charges,” said Menon, adding that they are not staying in the apartment as of now. The couple also mentioned that the president doesn’t want to negotiate the issue in a civil manner despite them trying to explain to him that their dog wouldn’t harm anyone and that it is vaccinated. Meanwhile, M Ravinder Reddy, Sub-Inspector, Kukatpally police station said, “We have called both the parties and gave a strong warning to the apartment president for his behaviour with the couple. After the couple demanded an apology, he apologised to them. We would have booked a FIR if the complainants wanted but they only asked for an apology. Even now, if they want to register their complaint, we will do as per their wish.” The couple also sent a legal notice to the apartment president to ensure that neither they nor the dog are harmed by apartment members in future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/couple-files-plaint-after-apartment-association-prez-threatens-to-kill-pet/articleshow/81938928.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: School that threw out student says dad harassed it||MUMBAI: A school that expelled a 13-year-old student on Tuesday told Bombay high court his father was to blame as he indulged in political acts, and harassed it for five years over fees. A bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Chandrakant Bhadang heard a petition by Ashutosh and his father Arvind Tiwari, an advocate, to set aside a March 25 letter by P G Garodia School at Ghatkopar (E), and to direct his promotion to Std VIII. It also wanted the school education department to take action against the school for violating Right to Education Act. Tiwari, an NCP functionary, had intervened to support a state GR against fee hikes during the pandemic, and had filed a petition that led to cancellation of ICSE board exams for classes X and XII. The petition, filed through advocate Atal Dubey, said they were “actual two reasons” that angered ICSE Board and affiliated schools. In March 2021, HC vacated its stay on the GR and directed that it was with prospective effect. After receiving a final notice for 2020-21, Tiwari paid all fees under protest but questioned “double-charging and profiteering”. On March 20, the school had not uploaded Ashutosh’s results. On March 25, it sent a letter that it was not accepting fees paid under protest, and decided not to give Ashutosh admission for the next academic year, citing reasons, including Tiwari filing false complaints against the school. “Unfortunately, action of the school is only to stop the voice of petitioner 2 (Tiwari) which he raised on violations of law by the school,’’ the petition said, adding that Ashutosh had a good academic record. The school advocate said the boy was expelled from the next academic year. “The father indulged in political acts. He harassed the school for five years.” The court posted the hearing on April 19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-school-that-threw-out-student-says-dad-harassed-it/articleshow/81940269.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||World||Myanmar curbs may lead to civil war, says Russia, but EU plans more||Russia said on Tuesday the West risked triggering civil war in Myanmar by imposing sanctions on the military junta that has seized power in a coup, but France said the European Union will step up restrictions on the generals. The Kremlin's show of support was a boost to the junta that overthrew Aun San Suu Kyi's elected civilian government on Feb. 1. But it still faces a sustained campaign of pro-democracy demonstrations and civil disobedience across the country, and condemnation and more sanctions from the West. In Myanmar's main city Yangon on Tuesday, protesters sprayed red paint on roads, symbolising the blood shed in a crackdown by the security forces. "The blood has not dried," said one message in red. About 570 people, including dozens of children, have been shot dead by troops and police in almost daily unrest since the coup, and security forces have arrested close to 3,500 people, advocacy group the Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) said. Among those detained are Suu Kyi, Myanmar's most popular politician, and members of her National League for Democracy, which trounced military-backed candidates in a November election. However, Russia said on Tuesday that sanctions against the authorities were futile and extremely dangerous. "In fact, such a line contributes to pitting the sides against each other and, ultimately, pushes the people of Myanmar towards a full-scale civil conflict," the Russian Foreign Ministry said, quoted by the Interfax news agency. Russia is a major arms supplier to Myanmar and its deputy defence minister met coup leader General Min Aung Hlaing in the capital Naypyitaw last month, drawing criticism from rights activists who accused Moscow of legitimising the junta. The European Union was preparing to impose collective sanctions on the Myanmar military targeting its business interests, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said in Paris. "We are going to add economic sanctions at the level of the 27 (EU countries)...against the economic entities linked to the army so that they (sanctions) can be applied very quickly," Le Drian told lawmakers. The EU last month imposed sanctions on a number of figures linked to the coup and the subsequent repression, while the United States has also taken measures against individuals and military-run businesses, which cover a wide span of Myanmar's economic life. A protest scheduled for Wednesday has called for the burning of Chinese-made goods. Many protesters are opposed to China, a major investor in Myanmar, because it is seen as supporting the junta. NEXT GENERATIONAnger has swept Myanmar in the past two months over the coup that brought an abrupt end to a brief era of democratic and economic reform and international integration that followed the military's oppressive 1962-2011 rule. Suu Kyi and her party had pledged to change the constitution to reduce the military's political clout. The junta says it acted because the November election was fraudulent - an assertion dismissed by the election commission and international observers - and says it will hold a new election. Western countries have backed the protesters' calls for Suu Kyi and her government to be reinstated. The ability to organise protests has been hampered by the military's restriction of broadband wireless internet and mobile data services that had been the main channel for spreading word of what was happening in the country. Those able to access social media on Tuesday shared pictures of striking workers marching for a second day in the city of Mandalay, some wearing gas masks and giving the three-finger salute that has become a symbol of resistance to army rule. Authorities have issued arrest warrants for dozens of celebrities, models and influencers, and on Tuesday a popular comedian was arrested in Yangon, the Mizzima news site reported. Sithu Aung Myint, a prominent journalist, was on the wanted list. Writing on Facebook, he said he was proud to be considered a threat. "When the coup council who have been committing crimes announces you as a lawbreaker together with the whole country, you will be more than happy because you are recognised as a hero in this revolution," he wrote. "Your next generation will be proud of you."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/myanmar-curbs-may-lead-to-civil-war-says-russia-but-eu-plans-more/articleshow/81942373.cms||---

The man lodged a police complaint after the incident. Police said one of the arrested men had been stalking the complainant’s daughter for the past few months. A few days ago, she rejected the man’s advances. Her father too objected to the man’s behaviour, which infuriated him, police said. On Sunday night, the trio — Saurabh Adagale, Rohit Bhosale and Sagar Adagale — and a 17-year-old boy, all residents of Kalepadal in Hadapsar, gathered in front of the girl’s house. They started loudly calling out to her. Her father — who works in a private company — asked them to keep quiet. When his pleas fell on deaf ears, he and his daughters decided to walk down to a nearby police chowkey. The suspects then accosted them. They attacked the man with a sharp weapon and a stone and slapped his daughters. They issued threats and fled the spot. Police arrested the trio and detained the boy the following morning. The men have been charged with attempt to murder, voluntarily causing hurt, abuse and threat against the trio. They have also been booked under the Disaster Management Act and for violating the state’s Covid-19 guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/three-held-on-charge-of-assaulting-man-and-his-two-daughters/articleshow/81938940.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Cine forum’s note invites controversy||Kolkata: A message signed by Federation of Cine Technicians and Workers of Eastern India (FCTWEI)’s president Swarup Biswas and general secretary Aparna Ghatak about non-attendance at Sunday’s rally has run into a controversy. Referring to it, both Tollygunje’s BJP candidate Babul Supriyo and Left candidate Debdut Ghosh have seen it as a reflection of the FCTWEI leaderships’ “threat” to technicians. In the notice, FCTWEI leaders have thanked those who had attended the rally in protest against defamation of the forum. They also said that FCTWEI will “deeply think” about those prominent technicians including directors, camerapersons, makeup artistes who hadn’t attended the “historic” rally. Taking a dig at Biswas on Facebook, Supriyo described this as a threat. “Even those who were forced to attend the rally are extremely irritated by the Biswas brothers,” wrote Supriyo, adding that those members will ensure BJP’s victory in the polls against TMC’s Tollygunje candidate Aroop Biswas — who is also Swarup Biswas’ brother. Swarup, however, didn’t take this lying down. “Among the 7,000 members of FCTWEI, 5,700 attended the 8 km rally on Sunday. Is it possible to force so many people to walk in a rally like this? If some have not attended the rally, we need to know their views as well,” he said. But, Debdut isn’t convinced, saying: “What was written in the notice was nothing but a threat. That's what my knowledge and study of Bengali says.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cine-forums-note-invites-controversy/articleshow/81938937.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Allahabad||City agri-scientist develops sugar-free wheat varieties||Prayagraj: A 79-year-old genetic scientist at Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Science (SHUATS), Mahabal Ram, professor emeritus, has developed two new varieties of wheat that are very high in nutrition, need less water, are resistant to extremes of weather and have very low sugar content. The two semi-dwarf high yielding varieties — SHIATS-W6 and SHUATS-W10 — are good for diabetics also since they have so less sugar content that they can be considered sugar-free. Ram, the elderly scientist, has also written to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath requesting him to ensure more cultivation and wider use of these nutritive-rich super wheat varieties that have already been notified by Central Variety Release Committee of the Union ministry of agriculture and are under limited cultivation in the state. “The two wheat varieties offer high yield and have higher protein, iron, fiber content while the sugar is below detection limit. They are ideal for a state like Uttar Pradesh which is still battling malnutrition and can survive extreme climate conditions like heavy rain and dry summers with high temperature,” said the agro-scientist. These wheat varieties can be provided to the poor through public distribution system as well to battle malnutrition, he added. The two varieties are a boon amid growing concerns over falling farm output due to rise in temperature and unpredictable rainfall. Prof Ram, an eminent geneticist and plant breeder, said the State Variety Release Committee, UP, Lucknow, has also formally released these two varieties for cultivation and thousands of farmers in 11 districts, including Prayagraj, Kaushambi, Pratapgarh, Fatehpur, Mirzapur, Varanasi, Jaunpur, Azamgarh, Ghazipur and Mahoba, have started cultivating the two varieties, he added. “Both the varieties can tolerate high temperatures of 40 to 42 degree Celsius against 30 to 32 degrees of regular varieties sown by farmers. They can even withstand waterlogging for 7-8 days and still flourish,” he claimed. The cost of production of the two varieties is 30-35% less as compared to ICAR-released wheat varieties PBW 343, HD 2967 and DBW 187, he said. In grain quality analyses, CSIR-Central Food Technological Research Institute Mysuru found SHIATS-W6 having protein (14.31%), zinc (3.44mg/100g), iron (3.54mg/100g), fibre (2.89%) and sugar below detection limit i.e., free from sugar. The SHUATS-W10 variety contains protein (12.56%), zinc (3.19mg/100g), iron (3.39mg/100g), fiber (2.49%) and sugar (0.2%), he informed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/city-agri-scientist-develops-sugar-free-wheat-varieties/articleshow/81940273.cms||---
---||Delhi||After tiff, Covid-19 volunteer attacks commuter with belt in Delhi||NEW DELHI: There was high drama at the IIT intersection near Hauz Khas in south Delhi on Monday when civil defence volunteers stopped cars and booked commuters for not wearing masks. The situation took a grim turn when one of the volunteers began whipping a protesting car occupant with his belt. FIRs have been filed on the complaints of both the commuter and the civil defence volunteers. The police control room received a phone call around 3pm about a fight at the traffic junction at IIT Gate. A police team reached the location to find civil defence volunteers issuing challans for violation of mask norms. Atul Thakur, DCP (South), noted that the sudden stoppage of the cars led to collisions. “Car driver Gitesh Dagar applied the brakes suddenly and a car hit it from behind. Dagar came out of the car and exchanged words with the civil defence people,” said Thakur. “A volunteer allegedly attacked Dagar with a belt upon, which other road users gathered and allegedly thrashed the volunteers, with Dagar joining them.” Some civil defence volunteers sustained injuries in the scuffle and were taken to hospital, where police recorded their statements. Several videos of the incident recorded by passers-by went viral on social media. One caught the civil defence volunteer using his belt to beat the driver as others try to intervene. In another, a passer-by can be seen thrashing the civil defence volunteer. Dagar was accompanied by his aunt, who complained to police that she was also harassed by the volunteers. “Two separate cases have been registered, one on the complaint of the civil defence volunteers and the other on Dagar’s complaint against the former,” said Thakur. “Action is being taken as per the law. Our investigations in the case are under way, but no arrests have been made so far.” Meanwhile, taking note of complaints of extortion by civil defence volunteers who have been hauling up citizens over Covid-related issues, the Delhi Police brass has asked all DCPs to prevent any lawlessness in their districts. The instructions said that such volunteers had no authority to penalise car drivers and that suddenly stopping the cars could cause serious accidents. The cops and traffic officers were also asked to make sure the civil defence volunteers didn’t make use of police barricades. In a tweet, Delhi Police urged people to verify the identity of those issuing challans. The cops claimed to have registered some FIRs in this regard. Last month, Twitter users had highlighted the harassment of a journalist and his wife at ITO allegedly for not wearing masks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-tiff-covid-19-volunteer-attacks-commuter-with-belt/articleshow/81939004.cms||---

After the residents in Nair Medical College in Mumbai went on mass leave protest from Monday, their counterparts in Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH) in Nagpur have decided to follow them. On Tuesday, IGGMCH residents issued an ultimatum to the dean stating they will withdraw services from out-patient departments (OPDs) and wards, including Covid wards, from April 7 onwards. “If our requests are not considered and if the same scenario repeats wherein residents only have to face the brunt of the situation, we would be left with no choice but to withdraw our services in OPDs, wards (including Covid wards) from 12 noon of Wednesday,” reads the ultimatum signed by Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) president at IGGMCH, Dr Rajat Agrawal and secretary Dr Ashish Kendre. While residents will stop work in wards, they will continue their services in intensive care units. “We assure that emergency services (SARI, Covid and non-Covid ICUs) will not be hampered. But in case our demands remain unmet, then we would be left with no choice but to withdraw from emergency services too,” the letter reads. Dr Agrawal told TOI that copy of the ultimatum has been sent to district health officer and Nagpur civil surgeon for reference. “We have served as frontline workers since the onset of the pandemic irrespective of our specializations. Even treatment protocols were not fixed at that time,” said Dr Agrawal. “We have suffered through academic loss of one year and still counting. Violating public health guidelines, we have been assigned for approximately 56 hours / week duty in Covid wards. We don’t even get any Covid allowance, neither any exemption from fees, nor any relaxation in thesis submission,” he added. The medicos also alleged that they were provided extremely poor quality personal protective equipment (PPE) kits putting them at great risk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mayo-residents-to-go-on-mass-leave-from-today/articleshow/81940282.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Hosabale had replaced Bhaiyaji Joshi as Sarkaryavaha at the RSS national meet — Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha — held at Bengaluru last month. RSS sources said Hosabale was on a day’s visit to the RSS headquarters at Nagpur. Hosabale’s administrative base continues to remain at Lucknow. A decision on shifting it to Nagpur would be taken in the coming days, said RSS functionaries while talking to TOI. Like the Sarsanghchalak, (chief) Mohan Bhagwat, even the Sarkaryavaha is based at Nagpur. Joshi, who was the previous Sarkaryavaha, was also based at Nagpur along with Bhagwat. During his tour, Hosabale visited the Smruti Mandir campus at Reshimbagh to pay homage to RSS founder Dr Keshav Baliram Hedgewar. Hosabale was accompanied by Joshi. RSS functionaries say it is not unusual for the Sarkaryavaha to have administrative base at a place other than Nagpur. Even Bhagwat’s administrative office remained at Kolkata for some years when he was the Sarkaryavaha. Hosabale is the first person to have not grown from pure RSS ranks to reach the post. He comes from Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hosabale-visits-rss-hqs-after-becoming-sarkaryavaha/articleshow/81940330.cms||---

Police were used to evict them during the special general body meeting of the Panvel City Municipal Corporation convened to debate property tax. Opposition members were demanding a physical session instead of an online one. The house was adjourned thrice. “BJP-ruled PCMC used police to evict us after turning down our demands for a physical general body meeting. Fourteen corporators, who are members of parties which are constituents of MVA, and one BJP corporator, Leena Garad, have been suspended for a month in blatant violation of laws. It is a black day and PCMC general body should be dismissed,” said suspended corporator Ganesh Kadu. “Security guards and policemen were pressed into service in the house during the meeting in violation of the law. Corporators cannot be suspended for any unruly situation in just one session,” said Garad. “After issuing warnings and adjournments, the suspension was ordered. The Corporation Procedure Rules (CPR) have not been framed,” said Choutmol. “Mayor and deputy mayor have no authority under the Municipal Corporation Act to call any force into the house in whatsoever situation. Framing of the CPR is mandatory to conduct house business,” said former BMC secretary Narayan Pathare.  “Mayor has to consider the behaviour of the corporators for two or three consecutive sessions before suspending any corporator. Police forces cannot be used in the house,” said NMMC secretary Chitra Baviskar. “I will not comment on police action,” said senior police inspector Ajaykumar Landge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-cops-called-to-evict-15-corporators-from-panvel-civic-house/articleshow/81940415.cms||Umesh K Parida

As per the GO, the flash floods last October, which resulted in inundation of low-lying areas, affecting nearly 40,000 families, were attributed to the deficiencies in the existing Storm Water Drainage (SWD) system, including encroachment in the natural flow of water which needs thorough revamp of drainage system considering exponential expansion of the city in recent decades. Therefore, in order to prevent and mitigate the consequences of flooding in future and minimise the damages, the government has established Strategic Nala Development Programme (SNDP) to plan, develop and maintain comprehensive storm water drainage/nala system in Hyderabad. “SNDP had carried out detailed study of the existing nala and storm water drainage system and has identified critical narrow points, encroachments on nalas, trunk mains, feeder nalas among other issues and submitted a detailed report to take up all the works on a mission mode. These include crucial works in peripheral Urban Local Bodies as well,” the order read. The GHMC commissioner shall prioritise the works to be taken up in the first phase and take necessary action accordingly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/go-issued-for-renovation-of-stormwater-drains-in-city/articleshow/81938956.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Allahabad||Allahabad HC advises govt to chalk out plan for door-to-door vaccination drive||PRAYAGRAJ: Emphasising the need to combat the second wave of Covid-19, the Allahabad high court on Tuesday directed the district administration and police authorities to once again get into action and ensure there is 100 per cent adherence to safety protocols across the state. The court directed the director general of police to chalk out a programme at his own level to ensure compliance of its order. The high court also directed the state government to check the feasibility of vaccination for one and all and not for just people aged above 45. “The government should check the viability of inoculating students who will take the high school and intermediate exam. In fact, a door-to-door vaccination programme should be chalked out,” the court said. It also asked the government to examine the possibility of night curfew to check late evening gatherings. Hearing a PIL relating to Covid-19, a division bench comprising Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Siddhartha Varma asked the district administration and police authorities to make sure there is no overcrowding in a public place across the state. “If authorities anticipate overcrowding in a particular place, they should cordon off that area and see that people do not huddle,” the court underlined. Regarding the ongoing panchayat elections in the state, the court said the polls should be conducted in such a manner that no congregation takes place. “Be it nomination, canvassing or voting, it should be seen that all Covid-19 protocols are followed,” the court said. “The state government may also examine the viability of providing masks and sanitisers to people by utilising the amount recovered from violators of Covid norms,” the court stated. Posting the next hearing on Thursday, the court said general public should also realise its responsibility towards Covid protocols. Elaborating the need for passing these directives, the court observed, “Though the state government has taken necessary steps to contain the second wave of Covid-19, it is being noticed that the orders are not being complied with by the public at large and that is a cause of concern. Having considered all the objective conditions, we deem it appropriate to direct the district magistrates to ensure strict and definite compliance of the directions issued by the government of Uttar Pradesh from time to time to fight the pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-get-into-action-ensure-100-compliance-to-covid-19-protocols/articleshow/81940315.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

The 50,000 odd residents of 13 villages on this island, situated between two rivers — Roopnarayan and Mundeswari — and only accessible by boat and a bamboo bridge, swim against the electoral ride in the state. While other parts of the state registers polling in excess of 80 per cent of vote, the election commission personnel and the candidates struggle to push the poll percentage to even 55 per cent in this island. “What is the point of voting when we will continue to live in conditions devoid of basic amenities like healthcare facilities, accessibility with the mainland and potable drinking water?” asked Kamaleshwar Gayen, 70, a resident of Ghoraberia village on the island who has seen politicians of several hues visit them with bouquet of promises before the polls only to forget after winning. “People on the island have become disillusioned with the electoral system which is why there is no enthusiasm during elections,” Gayen added.  Most inhabitants of the island are farmers, but lack of no irrigation facilities doesn’t allow them to reap two crops a year. A sizeable section of the population are daily labourers, who visit the mainland every day in search of jobs. “But all jobs have dried due to lockdown and Covid-19. So, most of us stay here and stay idle throughout the day,” said Bapon Zamadar, a resident of Mirpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/river-island-bhatora-swims-against-poll-tide/articleshow/81938986.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Architect Harshad More said construction sites are allowed to operate, but if no drawings, plans and designs are received, work will be hit, which the industry cannot afford at this stage. “The government has allowed discount in premium for a limited period and crucial time will be lost in this Break the Chain order,” he said. The Builders Association of India said festivals like Gudi Padwa, Akshaya Tritiya, considered auspicious to book new homes, are round the corner. “If our sales office is closed, buyers will face a lot of problems.

School education minister, Varsha Gaikwad on Tuesday met senior officials from the education department to discuss the promotion. An official said the decision will be taken in a day or two. Most of the syllabus for standard IX was completed online but admissions to standard XI were going on until the end of March. Educators said standard XI students have been the worst hit due to the pandemic as the lectures they could attend were not many. These students will face board examinations and various entrance examinations next year. Dinkar Temkar, chairman of SCERT, said the discussion on standard IX and XI students’ situation was on and within a day or two, the government would announce its decision. “The education department is looking at how to conduct a bridge course especially for standard XI students so that the important topics are covered before they are taught standard XII syllabus,” Temkar said. Education activist Vaishali Bafna said, “There were standard XI admissions going on even in March. What will these students do if they are promoted to standard XII. Such a promotion hardly means anything. Many students in the cities where centralised admissions take place were admitted from November onwards. But, colleges did not start holding lectures till January-February. Hardly any practicals were held. Both standard IX and XII are important and considered tougher than the boards. But standard XI is the worst affected.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pressure-on-std-ix-xi-students-as-govt-mulls-promotion-decision/articleshow/81938996.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Rajkot||Rajkot: Pneumonia catching young Covid patients this time||RAJKOT/VADODARA: As the novel coronavirus throws up new symptoms, doctors in Rajkot have observed a sharp spike in young Covid-19 patients (less than 40 years) developing pneumonia. Pulmonologists whom TOI spoke to said this is a worrisome trend and in the last one week around 25% such patients have been affected by this lung infection. Dr. Milan Bhanderi, a pulmonologist said, “Earlier, Covid symptoms were not very severe in young patients but I am shocked to see many below 40 years contracting pneumonia after testing positive. In many cases, these patients were asymptomatic for the first few days after infection, but later hospitalization becomes a must due to breathing problems. According to doctors, this is making their prediction of severeity difficult and they have to rely only on blood reports to take the calls of further treatment. If doctors wait for improvement in patient’s condition after his/her blood report is normal, the condition can suddenly deteriorate but because of non-synchronization of CRP and D-dimer with the lung’s condition. Earlier, the CRP and D-dimer levels used to change with changes in lungs condition, but this time these parameters are not spiking. Dr. Jayesh Dobariya, a critical care specialist, added “We are seeing more severity among young patients in the current wave. Covid is affecting both the lungs and patients are suffering from extreme weakness due to less oxygen.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/pneumonia-infecting-young-ncov-patients-this-time/articleshow/81937199.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Police registered a suo motu case after the video of the dance went viral on social media. According to Chandrayangutta inspector Rudra Bhaskar, a suo motu case was registered on April 5 after they came across a viral video on social media where a group of men indulged in obscene dance with unknown women in a room. “Some of the men were later identified and a case was registered,” the inspector said. During the preliminary probe, police identified that the video was recorded at the farmhouse of businessman Parvez of Bandlaguda. Though the messages on social media accompanying the video alleged that Parvez is a local worker of a political party, police said that they do not have any such information. “Parvez is a businessman. As per our information, he is not affiliated to any political party. Parvez organised the party along with his friends, Farooq, Jahangir, Azeem, Baba and others on the occasion of opening ceremony of his farmhouse, Imperial Farm House, at Lake View Hills in Bandlaguda in February 2021,” SI K Govardhan Reddy said. “There were about 12 men and eight women at the event.

Business Insider reported last week that phone numbers and other details from user profiles were available in a public database. Facebook said "malicious actors" had obtained the data prior to September 2019 by "scraping" profiles using a vulnerability in the social media service's tool to sync contacts.

The colony for the visually impaired at Sakkimangalam here has about 60 families and 100 votes. These families were rehabilitated here about a decade ago and each household has at least one visually impaired person. Thanga Perumal, a resident in the colony, said they had settled here in 2013 after land was allotted by the then DMK government and the houses constructed by Rotary Club. He said that even in 2019 Lok Sabha elections they voted on EVMs fitted with braille stickers which helped them identify the party symbol and vote accordingly. Earlier they could take their children or a helper with sight to vote for them. Bose and Augustin, two residents, said they realised unavailability of braille EVMs only when they reached the polling booth and had to seek the help of the officials at the booths to vote for them. “The only thing is that though we believe the officials would have done their duty and voted for the candidates as per the wish of the voter, there is an inkling of a doubt,” they said. Thanga Perumal said that he usually waited for his son Daniel Thangadurai to assist him, but as he was working in Nagercoil, he decided to go and vote. Nearly 70 of them had voted by 4pm on Tuesday. Daniel is a first time voter. Tamil Nadu Crawling Physically Disabled Persons Association general secretary S Raja complained that he had not found a wheelchair to go into the poll booth, though it had a ramp.

The case was registered on the complaint of sub-inspector Rajesh Kumar, posted with the chief minister flying squad, against then SDM Satbir Singh Jangu (HCS), Surjeet Nain (HCS)), former clerk Om Prakash Sihag, Rajesh Khatak, and three vehicle owners — Shamshir Alam Khan, a resident of Akbarpur village in Rohtas district of Bihar; Ramesh, a resident of Kanheri village of Fatehabad; and Bhim Singh, a resident of Dult village of Fatehabad. The complainant stated that while investigating a case, he had met clerk Ajmer Singh for records of some vehicles and provided a verified copy of the documents of the same. While Scorpio (HR-61A-8000 ), Cruiser (HR-02AT-6882) and Ritz (HR-88-2310) were found registered on the basis of fake documents, there were none of HR31H-9322 and HR-71H-1744, he told police. Police said that after registering a case, its investigation has been handed over to ASI Radheshyam but no arrest has been made so far. The Scorpio was registered at the SDM’s office on October 1, 2018, in the name of Shamshir Alam Khan, who, as per records, was a resident of Fatehabad. But there was no proof of residence in the file. Even the vehicle passing report was not found. On April 21, 2020, a land cruiser was registered in the name of Ramesh. The vehicle registration file did not even have a vehicle passing report and a slash mark was found in the documents to hide the old record next to the chassis number. The file of Ritz, registered on April 25, 2019, in the name of Rajesh Kumar, also did not have a vehicle passing report and had a slash mark to hide the old record next to the chassis number.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/fake-vehicle-registration-2-hcs-officers-5-others-booked/articleshow/81939006.cms||KUMAR MUKESH

---||Chandigarh||UP cops leave Pb jail with Ansari||Chandigarh/Lucknow/Jhansi: The Ropar jail authorities on Tuesday afternoon handed over the custody of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari to a contingent of UP Police that reached there in the morning. The convoy carrying BSP’s Mau MLA is likely to reach Banda jail by Wednesday morning. The UP team, including two ASP rank officers, left Ropar jail around 2.15pm after a medical examination of Ansari, who is facing various criminal cases in UP courts. On March 26, the Supreme Court had ordered Punjab to hand over Ansari’s custody to the UP police within two weeks. Ansari was brought to Ropar jail on production warrant in 2019 in a case of extortion and has been here ever since. Senior police officials in UP said Ansari has been accommodated with his wheelchair in the ambulance which is being escorted by six police vehicles and a Vajra Vahan. In Banda, security arrangements are well in place around the jail compound while police have been put on high alert in three adjoining districts: Hamirpur, Chitrakoot, and Mahoba. A police outpost and no-vehicle zone has been created outside the Banda jail. Fifteen jail warders along with 20 other jail personnel have been deployed at the Banda jail. A special medical team has also been constituted by the Banda district hospital to attend to Mukhtar. UP jail minister Jai Kumar Singh Jakki told reporters in Lucknow that additional CCTVs have been installed in Banda jail which will be monitored by jail headquarters from Lucknow. “Mukhtar will be lodged in the same barrack in which he was lodged last time before being shifted to Ropar jail,” he said. Another team of Barabanki police also left Ropar on Monday night, after taking custody of the controversial ambulance bearing registration number UP AT 7171 from the Ropar court. Police had recovered the ambulance from Manali road in Ropar district on Sunday. The Barabanki police had registered an FIR in the case after the ambulance came into limelight the day it was used to ferry Ansari from Ropar jail to the Mohali court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/up-cops-leave-pb-jail-with-ansari/articleshow/81939018.cms||---

He said the MC would spend around Rs 5.5 crore on sprucing up areas around Durgiana Temple and the project would be completed soon. “Almost 70% work, which included widening of streets and laying of cobbled stones, has been done and rest would be finished in near future,” said the mayor. Former cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu had in 2018 announced the heritage street around Durgiana Temple. The project has, however, already missed a deadline. Rintu said development work included removal of hanging power cables, streamlining billboard, and installation of fancy lights and fountains, among others. Asked about stray animals, the mayor said the MC had developed a cow shelter with a capacity to house 350 animals, but another would be constructed to accommodate a total of over 500 stray animals. He added they had created a facility where 1,000 stray dogs would be sterilised in a month and the capacity would be increased to 2,000 after some time. Rintu added the MC was also planning to introduce a common helpline for all government services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/asr-2nd-heritage-street-ready-soon/articleshow/81939021.cms||Yudhvir Rana

At 6.50 pm on April 4, B Ganesh Yadav, who runs a bike resale and vehicle finance business, noticed an auto driver snatching the gold chain of an old woman at RC Puram Sunday market and chased the snatcher on his scooter. “The auto driver had covered his vehicle number plate with cardboard. While riding the scooter, I noticed that the woman suddenly started screaming and the auto speeding past me. I gave a chase and overtook the auto at ICRISAT main gate when he was trying to take a U-turn. I blocked his way and confronted him,” Ganesh Yadav told TOI. The chain snatcher tried to fool Ganesh, saying that he panicked after the auto brushed past the woman and fled from the market. Ganesh then questioned about him concealing the vehicle registration number and found a packet of chilli powder and the snatched gold chain under the auto driver’s seat. “I took his phone and made him drive back to Sunday market in the auto. I followed on my scooter. Police reached there and I handed over the gold chain and phone to them,” Ganesh said. Ganesh said that he has always been keen on social service and helping the poor. Ganesh’s mother works in GHMC and his brother is a software professional. Two weeks earlier, Ganesh and his friend chased and caught two cellphone thieves at RC Puram after chasing them on foot for five kilometres. On Tuesday, Sajjanar felicitated Ganesh Yadav at the commissionerate and gave him a cash reward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bizman-who-chased-caught-chain-snatcher-honoured/articleshow/81939023.cms||---
---||Delhi||1 arrested for removal of Sai Baba idol from temple||New Delhi: Delhi Police has arrested a temple committee member for allegedly dislodging a Sai Baba idol at a temple in south Delhi’s Shahpur Jat. Police said a case was registered under IPC sections 153A (committing an offence at a place of worship) and 295A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), based on a complaint received from devotees of Sai Baba on Saturday. Padam Panwar has been sent to judicial custody. In the last week of March, a Shiv Mandir in Shahpur Jat, an urban village in south Delhi, witnessed an unusual change. A Shirdi Sai idol was replaced by a second one of Lord Ganesha, allegedly by a group of people claiming to be members of the temple’s management committee. They claimed that they had consulted the residents. This claim, however, was later denied by the local people, who said they had only got to know about the removal of the statue through videos shared on WhatsApp. The temple, popularly called Purana Shiv Mandir, have idols of Ganesha, Durga, Radha-Krishna, among others, locked in a glass enclosure. The Sai Baba idol, the only one without a glass enclosure, was placed in the centre, but now it has been replaced with another one of Ganesha. The video that was circulated among the locals showed several elderly men standing inside the temple and asking workers to remove the Sai Baba idol. One of them, later identified as Panwar, was reportedly heard as saying, “We are removing the Sai Baba idol as he is not a god. He died in 1918 and was a Muslim. We should install statues of those who died in the 1900s, like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Chandrashekhar and Rajguru.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/1-arrested-for-removal-of-sai-baba-idol-from-temple/articleshow/81939019.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Madurai||Used gloves treated as biomedical waste, but SOPs flouted at few booths||Trichy/Madurai: Single-use plastic gloves provided in polling booths for voters were treated as medical waste and were shipped to the biomedical waste management plant for safe disposal in Trichy. Each of the polling stations was expected to have generated around 1kg of plastic waste including hand gloves and facemask used by the voters. “We have provided yellow covers to every polling booth to collect the used hand gloves. After the polling was completed, we collected the waste generated and moved it to the biomedical waste management plant in Sengipatti,” an official with Trichy Corporation said. For the first time in the history of the assembly election in the state, the respective civic bodies had employed a sanitary worker in every polling station to assist the volunteers. Though Covid-19 safety gear such as masks, gloves, sanitisers and thermal scanners were made available at all polling booths, enforcement at some of the booths were not up to the mark in Madurai. At a few booths social distancing was not maintained and people were found not wearing masks. At booth number 207, in Melamadai School in Madurai North constituency, officials were seen not taking thermal checks and gloves were also not provided. Hand sanitizers too were not available in the booth. At some of the booths across the district, social distancing was difficult to maintain as some of the buildings had narrow or small entrances and waiting areas. The disposable plastic gloves were a bane for people residing close to the polling stations as dozens of gloves carelessly tossed in the air by voters landed on their houses. According to district health officials, none of the around 300 Covid-19 patients who are undergoing treatment requested to cast their votes. “We asked the patients if they would like to vote and that arrangements would be made. But, none of the patients came forward,” said Dr J Sangumani, dean, Government Rajaji Hospital. However, in other southern districts, few Covid-19 patients came forward to vote between 6-7 pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/used-gloves-treated-as-biomedical-waste-but-sops-flouted-at-few-booths/articleshow/81940392.cms||---

---||World||World powers, Iran and US launch indirect talks to revive nuclear deal||VIENNA: Officials from five world powers began a new effort Tuesday to try to bring the United States back into the foundering 2015 nuclear deal they signed with Iran, a delicate diplomatic dance that needs to balance the concerns and interests of both Washington and Tehran. The meeting in Vienna of envoys from Russia, China, Germany, France, Britain and Iran came as the U.S. was due to start its own indirect talks with Iran. It would be one of the first signs of tangible progress in efforts to return both nations to the accord, which restricted Iran's nuclear program in return for relief from U.S. and international sanctions. Following the closed meetings of the signatories to the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Russia's delegate, Mikhail Ulyanov, tweeted that the initial talks were ``successful.'' ``The restoration of JCPOA will not happen immediately. It will take some time. How long? Nobody knows,'' he wrote. ``The most important thing after today's meeting of the Joint Commission is that practical work towards achieving this goal has started.'' In 2018, then-President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. unilaterally out of the accord, opting for what he called a maximum-pressure campaign involving restored and additional American sanctions. Since then, Iran has been steadily violating restrictions in the deal, like the amount of enriched uranium that it can stockpile and the purity to which it can be enriched. Tehran's moves have been calculated to pressure the other nations in the deal to do more to offset crippling U.S. sanctions reimposed under Trump. U.S. President Joe Biden, who was vice president under Barack Obama when the original deal was negotiated, has said he wants to bring the U.S. back into the JCPOA but that Iran must reverse its violations. Iran argues that the U.S. violated the deal first with its withdrawal, so Washington has to take the first step by lifting sanctions. Following the meeting in Vienna, Iranian state television quoted Iran's negotiator, Abbas Araghchi, as reiterating that message during the opening round of talks. ``Lifting U.S. sanctions is the first and the most necessary action for reviving the deal,`` Araghchi was quoted as saying. ``Iran is fully ready to reverse its activities and return to complete implementation of the deal immediately after it is verified sanctions are lifted.`` At the meeting, participants agreed to establish two expert-level groups, one on the lifting of sanctions and one on nuclear issues, which were ``tasked to identify concrete measures to be taken by Washington and Tehran to restore full implementation of JCPOA,'' Ulyanov tweeted. They are to start work immediately, and report their conclusions to the main negotiators. The ultimate goal of the deal is to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb, something it insists it doesn't want to do. Iran now has enough enriched uranium to make a bomb, but nowhere near the amount it had before the nuclear deal was signed. In the latest announced violation, Behrouz Kamalvandi, a spokesman for Iran's civilian nuclear program, said officials had begun mechanical testing of an IR-9 prototype centrifuge. That centrifuge would enrich uranium 50 times faster than the IR-1s allowed under the accord, he said, according to the semi-official ISNA news agency. The clock is ticking on trying to get the U.S. back into the deal, with the goal of returning Iran to compliance, with a number of issues to consider. In late February, Iran began restricting international inspections of its nuclear facilities, but under a last-minute deal worked out during a trip to Tehran by Rafael Grossi, the head of the Vienna-based U.N. atomic watchdog, some access was preserved. Under the agreement, Iran will no longer share surveillance footage of its nuclear facilities with the IAEA but it has promised to preserve the tapes for three months. It will then hand them over to the IAEA if it is granted sanctions relief. Otherwise, Iran has vowed to erase the recordings, narrowing the window for a diplomatic breakthrough. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in March also urged the U.S. to act quickly, noting that as his country's June elections approach, Washington will find itself dealing with a government unable to make progress in the nuclear talks. In addition, one of the JCPOA's major so-called sunset clauses, a United Nations arms embargo on Iran, expired last year and others are set to expire in the coming years. The small window for negotiation will make it even more difficult for the U.S. to try to bring new concerns into the deal, such as Iran's regional influence and its ballistic missile program. As the diplomats met, a U.S. delegation headed by the administration's special envoy for Iran, Rob Malley was due in the Austrian capital. State Department spokesman Ned Price said talks will be structured around the working groups that the Europeans will form with the other parties to the accord. Price said Monday the talks are a ``healthy step forward'' but added that ``we don't anticipate an early or immediate breakthrough, as these discussions, we fully expect, will be difficult.'' ``We don't anticipate at present that there will be direct talks with Iran,`` he said. ``Though of course we remain open to them. And so we'll have to see how things go.`` Zarif on Friday reiterated Iran's position that no additional talks on the JCPOA are needed, since the deal and its parameters have already been negotiated. ``No Iran-US meeting. Unnecessary,'' he tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/world-powers-iran-and-us-launch-indirect-talks-to-revive-nuclear-deal/articleshow/81942381.cms||---

Officials sent EVM machines and other required materials to these villages on the backs of ponies. However, the number of people who voted was not encouraging as some villages witnessed only around 60% voting. A John David, a resident of Central Village in Kurangani Hills in Theni, said that there are 180 voters in the village but only around 110 cast their vote as villagers are staying and working in farms at various places. “People here would not consider parliamentary and assembly elections seriously. They all turn up only for local body elections, where every vote counts more. We are happy with the present government as our long-time demand of a road to the village will become a reality soon as the ground breaking ceremony was held recently,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/polling-in-remote-locations-poor/articleshow/81940405.cms||---

The counsel for AIMIM member J Ravindra had filed a petition with court seeking direction to the Abids police station to expedite the investigation which is pending since last 70 days in FIR No. 27 of 2021 pertaining to filing of false affidavit by Jaiswal of BJP as Jambagh elected corporator. Practicising lawyer Khaja Aijazuddin, in his petition, said that investigation didn’t conclude even as 70 days are over, compelling his client Ravindra to file petition before magistrate as per Supreme Court to seek status report, monitor and direct the SHO, Abids police station to file a chargesheet against Jaiswal. “The issue has been kept under cold storage for so many days,” said counsel Aijazuddin. The court directed the SHO Abids, to file the status report by April 23 before the court. Alleging cheating and suppression of facts, Ravindra, AIMIM candidate from Jambagh division, had filed a complaint with Abids police against Jaiswal, elected corporator from GHMC ward-77.

---||Pune||Lockdown gives new lease of life to stand-up comedian||Pune: The lockdown made stand-up comedian Papa CJ transition to the role of a sit-down entertainer as public gatherings were banned and live shows had to be cancelled. “I tend to look at all changes with excitement and I’m hard-wired to find the positive in any situation. Therefore, I looked at the lockdown as an opportunity to focus on things that I would not have been able to otherwise,” said he, humorously adding, “The pandemic has had various positive impacts on my professional life aside from significantly reducing the amount of tax I pay in a year!” While there is a change in feedback — from live roars of laughter that a comedian usually gains momentum from while on stage, to audiences muting themselves for auditory clarity during an online show, Papa CJ has found a workaround. “To my own surprise, I’m thoroughly enjoying performing online. During the lockdown my audience sizes have ranged from 25 people to 7,000 families. I have 25 people on gallery view with the audio and video on, who become the ‘panelists’ and the rest of the audience become ‘attendees’. Since everybody can hear their laughter, that gives me the energy I need to feed off of. Since I can see all 25 of them, they serve a similar role as the front two rows of a physical show,” he said, adding, “My shows have always been interactive and very customised — those are two areas where my focus has increased multifold because as a comedian if that is something you can’t offer an online audience, then they might as well watch Netflix.” He also used all the time on his hands to tap on all his past education and experience to create customised value-added solutions for corporate clients. “My background includes a Masters in Business Administration (MBA) degree from the University of Oxford and as an executive coach, I have run corporate training programmes for over 50 blue-chip companies across the globe. In addition to doing more of this work during the pandemic, I have created and delivered deeply interesting sessions for C-level executives who draw from the worlds of creativity, innovation, comedy, entrepreneurship and business. For example, I run a session called ‘A Comedian’s Guide to Communication Strategy’ where I break down the techniques that international comedians use to grab and retain attention and help my participants apply the same to their work and personal lives,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lockdown-gives-new-lease-of-life-to-stand-up-comedian/articleshow/81939029.cms||---

HOSMAC shall be preparing the master plan and will undertake detailed architecture and engineering design of the campus.SMRT will be a full-fledged medical school comprising of Centres of Excellence (CoE) and a first-of-a-kind Super-Specialty Teaching Hospital. The proposed hospital will be spread in area of more than one million square feet and will be India’s first-of-a-kind Super-Specialty Teaching Hospital with a Medical College. The building forms facade articulation, open spaces, vegetation strategy, water bodies and road networks have been designed to weave and merge into the thousand acres master plan of IIT-K, conceptualised by the late architect Padma Shri Achyut Kanvinde.HOSMAC was initially appointed by Tata Trusts to prepare a detailed business plan for IIT-K to assess the feasibility of starting a medical school within its premises. Director, IIT-K, Prof Abhay Karandikar said, “IIT Kanpur’s vision to merge medicine and engineering will be achieved with the School of Research and Medical Technology. This new initiative will bring about a sea change in innovative research that addresses medical problems through a robust R&D focus to develop need driven medical devices and technologies. The institute is envisaged to be a one-of-its-kind medical school that would offer EnMed (Engineering in Medicine) programs wherein medical graduates will also be trained in engineering disciplines and vice versa. We are sure that this path breaking centre would be a pioneer in terms of the manpower it would train at the interface of engineering and medicine.”“The primary aim is to innovate and develop medical technology that can be adapted to local needs of Indian patients. Since India is a net importer of med-tech (of almost 80%), the initiative will help make the country Atmanirbhar reducing costs and make treatment cheaper. To facilitate this vision, we have conceptualized the super-specialty hospital as a floor-wise medical specialization stack, having its own clinical space (like OPD, IPD and diagnostics) with academic research blocks,” said Dr Vivek Desai, founder & managing director of HOSMAC.In the first phase , the institute will offer post-graduate courses such as Cardiology & Cardiothoracic Surgery, Urology & Nephrology, Medical & Surgical Gastroenterology, Neurology & Neurosurgery and Oncology. The idea is to encourage innovation and research development in these fields specifically, and also address the dearth of super-specialists in the country. It will be open for MBBS admissions in phase II of the project, said deputy director deputy director, IIT-K, Dr Ganesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/hosmac-to-design-iit-ks-school-of-medical-research/articleshow/81940411.cms||Abhinav Malhotra
---||Hyderabad||Collector appears before HC, no relief on jail term yet||Hyderabad: Siddipet district collect P Venkatrami Reddy appeared before the Telangana high court on Tuesday in connection with a contempt case after he was awarded a three-month jail term for failing to present himself in the court. The collector appeared before the virtual court in the afternoon and apologised for his inability to appear before the court on time. Advocate general BS Prasad requested the court to stay the conviction, but the judges said they would hear the matter on April 8 along with similar appeals and adjourned the case without granting any relief to the collector and two other contemnors. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy grew serious after noticing the absence of the collector while hearing his appeal filed against his conviction and the consequent jail term. Prasad found it difficult to seek a stay of the conviction because the bench was seemingly angry. The collector’s conviction was preceded by a case filed by a farmer Gandla Tirupathi and another of Vemulaghat area whose land was acquired for Mallanna Sagar reservoir. A single judge earlier found that the officials flouted the orders of the court on one hand and tried to mislead the court on the other. He convicted Venkatrami Reddy and awarded him three months jail and four-month jail term to RDO Jayachandra Reddy and imposed penalty on IAS officer Krishna Bhaskar. Though he suspended the jail term for six weeks to enable the accused officials to file appeals, the six-week period was over. That is why the AG was seeking a stay on the conviction. The bench was reluctant to grant relief to the collector who chose not to appear before the court. It was then the AG sought a short passover of the matter and summoned the collector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/collector-appears-before-hc-no-relief-on-jail-term-yet/articleshow/81939039.cms||---
---||Mumbai||No vaccination for all, say union health officials a day after Maharashtra CM’s 25+ request||NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: A day after Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allow everyone above 25 years to get vaccinated, union health officials made it clear that the drive will not be opened for all. Thackeray had said inoculating a larger number of young and working population could reduce the intensity of the spread. The Centre said on Tuesday the vaccination policy was based on scientific principles and was intended to secure vulnerable population first keeping in mind vaccine supplies, and is no different from the approaches adopted by developed countries such as the US, the UK and Australia. Health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said the objective of vaccination was to inoculate “those who needed and not those who wanted it”. Bhushan said in the current phase of vaccinations till July, vaccines will be in limited supply and this meant that priorities had to be drawn up to protect those most vulnerable. “The primary objective is to reduce deaths and protect the healthcare system involved in combating the pandemic,” he said. Pointing out that India has lowered the vaccination age to 45, officials cited data to show several western countries with advanced facilities have not opened vaccination to all beyond age 50. While the UK has prioritised those between 16-64 years, it is only for those with underlying health conditions and unpaid carers for the elderly and the disabled. Similarly, Australia has opened it for adults but with underlying disability or medical conditions, Bhushan said. Bhushan further said the US was targeting people in the 65-75 years bracket till mid-April. Sweden and Switzerland, which have among the most advanced healthcare, are still only targeting the 65-plus groups and in Australia it is the 70-plus and the aboriginals. Public health minister Rajesh Tope, though, once again discussed the idea of vaccinating people above 25 years with union health minister Harsh Vardhan. “Most infected patients are from the age group of 25-40 years in the state and even the country,” said Tope. The state Covid taskforce, too, has demanded that an exception should be made for Maharashtra that is currently the worst affected in the country, reporting an average of 50,000 new cases everyday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-vaccination-for-all-say-union-health-officials-a-day-after-maharashtra-cms-25-request/articleshow/81939044.cms||---

Of the 58 assembly segments in the 10 districts in the region, the poll percentage dropped in 42 assembly segments compared to 2016 assembly elections, while there was an increase in only 16 assembly segments. O Panneerselvam’s Bodinayakanur segment in Theni district witnessed a 3.3% drop from 76.9% in 2016 to 73.7% on Tuesday. The only assembly segment with a sitting minister contesting that saw an increase is in Kovilpatti (+1.1%) in Tuticorin district where AIADMK’s Kadambur C Raju and AMMK founder T T V Dinakaran are in a face-off. Kanyakumari and Ramanathapuram are the only districts in the region to record an increase in poll percentage compared to 2016 assembly election. Voters of the six assembly segments in Kanyakumari district cast their votes for the assembly polls and the Lok Sabha bypoll. The district recorded 68.8%, a 2.5% increase compared to the last election (66.3%). Kanyakumari assembly segment recorded the highest polling (75.3%) in the district while Killiyoor (65.9%) was the lowest. However, Killiyoor saw a 5.2% rise from 2016 polls. Turnout in Ramanathapuram district increased in three of the four assembly segments while it dropped in all the seven assembly segments in Virudhunagar district, all the five assembly segments each in Tirunelveli and Tenkasi districts and all the four assembly segments in Theni district. Oddanchatram (85.1%) and Vedasandur (80.2%) in Dindigul district are the only assembly segments in the region to register more than 80% polling. Palayamkottai with 57.8% recorded the lowest in the region. In Madurai district, the voter turnout marginally dropped by 0.7% to 70.4% on Tuesday. Of the 26,97,682 electors in the 10 assembly segments in the district, 18,99,584 cast their votes. It includes 9.4 lakh men, 9,6 lakh women and 21 others. Though the number of women voters is high, the poll percentage of men (70.9%) is more than women (69.9%) as the number of women enrolled in the voters list is more than men. Meanwhile, the EVMs from the 10 assembly constituencies in Madurai were taken to four strong rooms at night under tight security, after polling concluded for the day. This is the first time the district is having four strong room centres. The EVMs from Madurai North, Madurai South, Madurai Central and Madurai west will be stored at Madurai Medical College. Those from Madurai East constituency and Melur will be kept under guard at the Tamil Nadu Agriculture College campus at Othakadai. The ones from Thiruparankundram and Thirumangalam will be kept at the Tamil Nadu Polytechnic College on TPK road and the EVMs from Usilampatti and Sholavandan will be kept at the Anna University campus at Keelakuyilkudi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/voter-turnout-marginally-drops-in-south-tn/articleshow/81940409.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Covid-19 in West Bengal: State breaches 2,000 a day mark first time this year||KOLKATA: The Covid-19 case count in Bengal this year shows the infection rate has doubled since last year. While it took two months for the number to increase 10 times last year, this year, it has happened in a month. As elections in Kolkata and neighbouring North 24 Parganas — the worst-affected districts — draw near, health experts fear a sharper spike in the next two to three weeks. On Tuesday, the number of fresh cases breached the 2,000 mark for the first time this and touched 2,058. The steep surge has prompted the state health department to call back senior doctors, including infectious diseases specialist Yogiraj Ray, who had played a sterling role to combat Covid during the first phase of infection, to Beliaghata ID Hospital. The nodal hospital for Covid care currently has 265 beds and 100 more are ready to tackle the surge of patients. Ray was released from ID Hospital to School of Tropical Medicine only about a couple of month ago. In addition to Ray, the health department has also called in two more senior doctors — Rajarshi Basu and Arijit Sinha, both from NRS Medical College — for Covid duty at the Beliaghata hospital. On May 24 last year, the state had recorded 208 fresh cases. It took a little more than two months for the daily cases to reach 10 folds when Bengal reported 2,198 cases on July 18. “This year, 209 new cases were reported on March 4, One month later, the state had 1,927 cases on April 4. So it took just one month for daily cases to rise by 10 times,” said Anirban Dalui, public health specialist at Swathya Bhawan. “If we take all sort of corrective measures right now, restrictions we could soon see daily cases rising to 6,000 to 7,000 cases by April-end,” cautioned Dalui. Doctors said that the absence of a lockdown, people not adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour, the mutant virus and mass gathering during election rallies are some of the reasons for this massive surge. “Last year, the lockdown had mechanically reduced/delayed the transmissibility of the virus while people were afraid and took to Covid-19 preventive protocols stringently. Aggravating the situation is the new mutants and the election rallies,” said microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri of Peerless Hospital. Diptendra Sarkar, professor of surgery at SSKM Hospital, said that if mutants of the virus arrive in such a situation where people are done away with their guards against the virus, coupled with no travel restrictions and massive gatherings, this was bound to happen. Sarkar is hopeful that speeding up vaccination could put up a speed breaker on the face of the spiralling infection rate. “The speed of vaccination is crucial at this juncture. Now with the 45 plus (workforce) included in the inoculation programme and the daily number of vaccination hitting above 30 lakh in about 10 weeks, about 30 crore people should have some protection. If this vaccination speed jumps up further, we will hopefully reach a baseline by July end,” said Sarkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-breaches-2k-a-day-mark-first-time-this-year/articleshow/81938064.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||‘Stretched poll schedule adding to virus worries’||KOLKATA: The long-drawn election process in Bengal has added to the Covid-19 threat to the state that is witnessing a rapid rise, claim doctors. Health experts said that political rallies, meetings and other gatherings where there is no adherence to Covid-19 protocol have contributed to the massive spike in infection. While polling in other states ended on Tuesday, Bengal, where elections are being held in eight phases, will have to wait for another three weeks for the elections to get over. “The speed at which the virus is spreading, we are heading to a very serious trouble given the kind of disregard for Covid-appropriate behaviour against massive gatherings in political gatherings and meetings. In another three weeks, we could be in a bigger wave that the first one,” said a senior doctor with the state-run hospital. TimesViewCovid and elections make a bad cocktail, as we are now learning to our own cost. The democratic process, obviously, cannot be stalled but all political parties and the administration must keep Covid protocols in mind. What we have seen happening on the ground is far from ideal. Hope Bengal does not have to pay too heavy a price for a five-week-long polling process.The gathering in meetings has facilitated mixing of people from one zone to another — say rural and urban people — and from other states, posing a threat of mutant strains. “Long-drawn elections have allowed rallies and mass gatherings to prolong where no one is abiding by Covid-19 protocols. Therefore, it is likely that we are yet to see the worst of this second wave,” said Anirban Dalui, public health specialist at Swasthya Bhawan. Microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri said the Covid burden in the most-affected Kolkata and North 24 Parganas could see a sharp escalation as election comes to these two districts. “The least the political parties could have done was to ensure Covid-19 protocol in their rallies by restricting number of people and political leaders adhering to the protocols and asking the mass to follow the same,” said Prabhas Prasun Giri, associate professor at the Institute of Child Health. Protect The Warriors (PTW), an association of doctors, on Tuesday shot off letters to several stakeholders, including the election commission and leaders of major political parties, appealing for ensuring Covid-19 appropriate behaviour at rallies, meetings, polling booths and on the counting day. PIL activist Subhas Datta has also written to chief election commissioner Sunil Arora, reiterating the demand for inclusion of Covid-19 health code practices and environmental norms in the code of conduct for the ongoing state elections. Pointing to the lack of compliance as prescribed by the health and family welfare ministry during election meetings and rallies as well as disregard to environmental norms as prescribed by the Supreme Court and National Green Tribunal, Datta has pointed out that while the EC’s role is to ensure free-and-fair election, it is also duty-bound to take care of the life and health aspects of citizens during the election process. Citing political parties’ and leaders’ failure to adhere to basic pandemic protocol, he referred to representations sent by him on March 16 on this issue as well as multiple representations since July 2018 on imposition of environment norms in the code of conduct for Assembly and Parliament elections that had not been acted upon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/stretched-poll-schedule-adding-to-virus-worries/articleshow/81938068.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Parents run from pillar to post to get birth certificate for boy born mid-air||JAIPUR: Parents of the baby boy who was born in the Bengaluru-Jaipur flight last month have been running from pillar to post to get a birth certificate for their child who is now 20 days old. The couple had boarded the flight around 5.45am from Bengaluru and landed in Jaipur airport around 8am on March 17 with their newborn baby. As per the rule, the birth certificate must be issued within 21 days of birth. Bhairu Singh, father of the baby, told TOI, “After delivery in the flight, we were taken to a private hospital in Jaipur but I did not get my wife and child admitted as it was very expensive. So, after initial check-up, we straight away went to my village Jaliya Rupabas in Beawar district.” After reaching the village, Bhairu started the process to get his son’s birth certificate. “I went to the sarpanch who told me to go to the government hospital from where I was sent to another hospital,” Bhairu told TOI. ‘Will believe it only when I get the document’ “Both hospital officials seemed confused as soon as I mentioned that my son was born mid-air. They told me to go to the gram panchayat,” Bhairu added. The gram panchayat, initially, declined to issue the certificate citing jurisdiction. “Although the certificate should be issued in Jaipur, we will start the process from here to help Bhairu Singh as now there is no other option left,” Dileep Singh, sarpanch, said. The family is being made to run from one government body to another with no official giving any clarity about issuing the certificate.

---||World||China cautions Japan against teaming up with US ahead of Biden-Suga meet||BEIJING: China's foreign minister cautioned Japan against teaming up with the U.S. to counter Beijing, as Japan speaks up more on human rights in China's Xinjiang region ahead of a US-Japan summit next week. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Japanese counterpart in a phone call Monday evening that their two countries should ensure that their relations ``do not get involved in the so-called confrontation between major countries,'' a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement said. It quoted Wang as saying that ``China hopes that Japan, as an independent country, will look at China's development in an objective and rational way, instead of being misled by some countries holding biased view against China.'' Japan, a close U.S. ally that hosts major American naval and air force bases, shares U.S. concerns about China's military buildup and claims to territory in the South and East China Seas. However, its major trade and investment interests in China have at times reined in its criticism of its larger neighbor. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is to travel to Washington to meet President Joe Biden on April 16 in what will be the U.S. leader's first in-person summit since taking office in January. Biden, in contrast to his predecessor Donald Trump, has stressed rebuilding ties with European and Asian allies as the U.S. prepares for competition with a rising China. Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi raised human rights in China's Xinjiang region and Hong Kong, both important issues for Biden. He also reiterated Japan's protest against China's presence in waters around a group of uninhabited, Japan-controlled islands that China claims in the East China Sea. Motegi told reporters Tuesday that he expressed ``grave concern and strongly requested China to take concrete actions`` for improvement on those issues, including the human rights situation in the Xinjiang region. Some members of a foreign policy team within Suga's conservative ruling party have called for his government to take a tougher stance against China over the Xinjiang situation. They say Japan should adopt a law to impose sanctions against a foreign country over human rights violations. The United States, Canada, Britain and the European Union have adopted such a law, and they say Japan is the only Group of Seven country without it. Japan has taken a softer approach by maintaining dialogue rather than imposing unilateral sanctions. But Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato on Tuesday said Japan is open to the possibility of having such a law. ``It is necessary to analyze and consider whether Japan should adopt a system that would unilaterally determine human rights violations and impose sanctions, taking into consideration various views including our ongoing human rights and foreign policies and trends in the international community,(asterisk) he said. Kato said it is important for each country to do what it can to improve human rights conditions. ``Japan will continue to cooperate with the United States and other related countries,'' he said. Wang opposed Japanese interference in China's internal affairs in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, the Chinese statement said. Taiwan is another potential flashpoint, with Suga saying earlier this week that Japan would cooperate with the U.S. on the issue. China regards the self-governing island as a renegade province that should be under Chinese rule. China, in a signal to the U.S. and its allies, recently sent an aircraft carrier group to waters near Taiwan for training exercises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/china-cautions-japan-against-teaming-up-with-us-ahead-of-biden-suga-meet/articleshow/81942391.cms||---

The duo had gone out to collect Mahua flowers in the forest when the incident took place. Official sources said Kamlakar Undirwade (60) and his nephew Durwas Unidrwade (48) had gone into the Pawanpar forest early in the morning. They were busy collecting Mahua flowers in compartment no. 1413 when a tiger attacked and killed both of them. Forest officials said it is rare that a tiger attacked and killed two people at the same spot. Officials suspect that the beast might have attacked one of the two and other is likely to have gone to his aid, which turned the tiger upon him. Officials of Sindewahi range rushed to the spot and took the dead bodies for post mortem. They have given ex-gratia aid to families of both the victims and sounded alert in the area, warning people not to venture into the forests. The incidents of tiger attacks have increased since the onset of Mahua season. Four people have died in the last two months in similar incidents. This incident has taken the total of human kills in predator attacks this year to 11. Nine of them have been killed in tiger attacks while other two were mauled by leopards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/two-killed-in-tiger-attack-in-sindewahi-forest/articleshow/81939045.cms||Mazhar Ali

The bereaved family claimed that their son was innocent and demanded justice. According to former village head Ranjeet Singh, the families of both persons killed in the firing are extremely poor and urged the administration to look into the matter seriously. Nepalese police had reportedly resorted to indiscriminate firing at four persons “illegally” crossing the border. One of them, Govinda Singh, had died on the spot while Gurmej was fatally injured and died during the treatment at a hospital in Lucknow. Pilibhit police refused to register an FIR on the complaint that Nepalese police opened fire at the farmers sowing sugarcane “near the no man’s land”. Police said it was an international issue and a report would be submitted to the state home ministry. Police said that they would take appropriate steps. Puranpur circle officer Lallan Singh told TOI, “The body was cremated peacefully in the village. We are in touch with Nepalese officials in this connection.” Accusing Pilibhit police of “covering the truth”, Ranjeet Singh, who is close to the bereaved family, told TOI, “The victims were only sowing sugarcane in the field when they argued with Nepalese police personnel in civil dress. And, all of sudden, the policemen opened fire at them. The family is extremely poor and can’t even take the matter forward for justice.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/body-of-farmer-killed-in-firing-by-nepal-police-cremated-under-heavy-security/articleshow/81937314.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||World||Jordan bans media coverage of royal rift||AMMAN: Jordan banned all news outlets and social media users on Tuesday from publishing any content related to King Abdullah's half-brother Prince Hamza after the latter was accused of plotting to destabilise the country. Prince Hamza pledged allegiance to King Abdullah late on Monday after mediation by the royal family, two days after the military warned him over actions it said were undermining "security and stability" in Jordan and placed him under house arrest. In unprecedented public criticism, Hamza, who was crown prince until King Abdullah removed him from the post in 2004, accused Jordan's leaders of corruption and serving only their own interests. The government says he liaised with people linked to foreign parties in a plot to destabilise Jordan and that he had been under investigation for some time. "To safeguard the secrecy of the investigations being undertaken by the security services in relation to His Highness Prince Hamza bin Hussain and others, Amman's public prosecutor has decided to ban the publication of everything related to the investigations at this stage," the state news agency reported. It said the ban applied to all news outlets as well as social media platforms. Prince Hamza said in a voice recording released by Jordan's opposition on Monday that he would not comply after being barred from any activity and told to keep quiet. While not considered a direct threat to the king, Hamza in recent weeks visited tribal gatherings where the king and his government have been criticised more openly. Saudi Arabia was among the countries to issue statements of support to King Abdullah, and on Monday Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan travelled to Amman to meet his Jordanian counterpart Ayman Safadi, the Jordanian foreign ministry said. "King Salman reaffirmed the kingdom's support to all measures to protect Jordan and its interests," Saudi state TV reported. King Abdullah had expressed "appreciation for the kingdom's continuous support to Jordan," it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/jordan-bans-media-coverage-of-royal-rift/articleshow/81942396.cms||---
---||India||Ram Nath Kovind appoints Justice NV Ramana as next CJI; set to be sworn in on April 24||NEW DELHI: President Ram Nath Kovind on Tuesday appointed Justice Nuthalapati Venkata Ramana, the seniormost Supreme Court judge, as the next Chief Justice of India. Justice Ramana will take oath as the 48th CJI on April 24 and will have a tenure of one year and four months. A staunch advocate of the right to access to justice for the last person in the socioeconomic hierarchy, Justice Ramana was a first generation lawyer born in an agriculturist family in Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh. Leaving behind his student activist days, he had briefly experimented with journalism by working in a leading Telugu newspaper before choosing to become an advocate. He was appointed as a judge of Andhra Pradesh HC in 2001, as chief justice of Delhi HC in September 2013 and an SC judge in February 2014. Asoft-spoken person, Justice Ramana has given many important and hard-hitting judgments, including the ruling on providing 4G internet services in Jammu and Kashmir, where the government had suspended high-speed internet servi ces after scrapping the state’s special status under Article 370. The Justice Ramana-led bench’s ruling that “access to internet” is a fundamental right of citizens found many admirers for him and the SC. As the new CJI, Justice Ramana will face many challenges. After the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted physical hearings and displaced a sizeable population from their workplaces, as head of the National Legal Services Authority, Justice Ramana invigorated the efforts of legal aid authorities across the country to help jail inmates through filing of bail applications, mediating bet ween spouses for amicable settlement of marital disputes and giving the poor required legal assistance. Though the CJI-designate intends to focus on access to justice for one and all, on his priority list are improving judicial infrastructure, modernising the functioning of courts by use of technology and strengthening the justice delivery system with necessary reforms. Filling huge vacancies in judges’ posts in high courts and even in the SC are going to be among the difficult tasks that Justice Ramana will have to tackle as CJI before his retirement on August 26, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kovind-appoints-ramana-as-next-cji-set-to-be-sworn-in-on-april-24/articleshow/81942371.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The 31-year-old Yogesh Chauhan passed away while he was under treatment for Covid-19 at Sumandeep Hospital, located on Kothi crossroads. His relatives alleged that while he was recovering from the infection, he died due to negligence of the hospital administration. Yogesh, a mechanical engineer by profession, was admitted to the hospital on Sunday.  On Monday, he was administered tocilizumab injection. “Although he was put on ventilator, his condition was improving. Yesterday, we were told that after administering the injection, his condition will improve further,” alleged his younger brother Chirag Chauhan. When TOI contacted the hospital, doctors concerned were busy talking to police.“On Tuesday morning, we received a call from the hospital that he had collapsed from the bed because of which his heart failed. We are not ready to buy this argument as there was bleeding and his eyes swollen,” he claimed. “We were not shown any x-ray or blood report. I had requested the hospital administration to send me the reports on my cell phone which they did not,” he alleged. Raopura police filed an accidental death report while his relatives submitted an application of complaint against the hospital.  In another case, a group of residents of Wadi area of the city alleged that the administration of Care Multispecialty Hospital on Waghodiya Road was not sharing details of their 50-year-old relative Laxmi Parmar, who was undergoing treatment for 14 days.

But peak season for leisure travel is May, which is a month away, and more vaccinations in urban centres will help recovery, it said. A travel agent said, “A small percentage of people booked to travel to Kashmir and south India in April but cancelled their trips. The travel sector has once again been hit due to rise in Covid cases.” Traditionally, leisure travel peaks in May, so there is time, and bookings may pick up. “Bookings reduce drastically after Holi and stay constant throughout March and April due to exams and financial year-end. This means overall leisure travel activity sees a lull after Holi and the wedding season, and picks up in May-June as school vacations start,’’ it added. Around five lakh passengers flew to/fro Mumbai-Delhi in April 2019, while in May 2019 the number went up to six lakh, according to Directorate General of Civil Aviation passenger traffic data. Other domestic routes too registered higher traffic in May, like on Mumbai-Goa route, it was 1.6 lakh in April and 1.8 lakh in May. “Therefore, the industry will not lose out on a good season but will see a decrease of 10-15% week-on-week in bookings in a period that witnesses lower demand traditionally,’’ the company added. The travel agent pointed out that the latest wave impacted forward bookings. “People will now want to wait and watch before they book for May travel,” he said. Indians are not too deterred by rising cases, said the company. “Bookings dropped by only 10% even though Covid cases are the highest recorded, telling us that the Indian traveller is being cautious but not deterred from undertaking trips,’’ it added. Also, by May-June, India is expected to vaccinate 30-40 crore people, adding that hotels can expect more bookings again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mumbai-hotel-bookings-drop-by-10-but-peak-season-still-a-month-away/articleshow/81940478.cms||---

He had been admitted in RMLIMS for eight days. Prof Shukla was the head of the department of Jyotir Vigyan and director of the Abhinavagupt Institute of Aesthetics and Shaiva Philosophy. His untimely death has rendered a blow to these two disciplines he nurtured all through his career. He was planning to start several PhD research courses on Shaivism from the coming session. He was also dean, faculty of arts, and officiating as the head of 12 other departments in which either a dispute over headship was on or a qualified person was not available. Prof Shukla, survived by his wife, son and daughter, is the fourth professor associated with LU to have succumbed to Covid in the past six months. He took ill soon after participating in a seminar held on March 23-24 to mark the inauguration of the building of the Abhinavagupt Institute and tested Covid-19 positive on March 28. He was admitted to RMLIMS the next day when his condition deteriorated. He died due to cardiac arrest triggered by respiratory failure. The demise of the Sanskrit scholar has sent shock waves across the academic world. Social media was flooded with condolence messages and photographs of Prof Shukla receiving Padma Shri from president Ramnath Kovind in 2019 and the inauguration of his institute’s building on March 23. LU also held an online meet to condole his death. With tears in her eyes, assistant professor in Sanskrit Bhuvneshwari Bhardwaj, who had also been Prof Shukla’s student, said, “It’s not just a loss for LU, but for the entire teaching fraternity across the world and Sanskrit language and research. He authored several papers and books. The list of awards he got is unending.” LU, colleges shut till April 10: Lucknow University on Tuesday announced to shut its campus and all associated colleges till April 10. On March 31, LU and colleges had decided to switch over to online teaching mode. However, LU teachers’ and employees’ associations have demanded that LU campus be declared a containment zone and closed till April 20 to break the transmission chain. Several family members of teachers down with Covid-19 have also tested positive. “Most of the teachers who got infected and the two professors who died had been coming to the university regularly till March 31,” said LUTA president Prof Vineet Kumar Verma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/virus-snuffs-out-eminent-lu-professor/articleshow/81940483.cms||---

He has been involved in manufacturing of spurious liquor for last 12 years. Last case was registered against him in August 2020 when 10,000 liter illicit liquor was recovered from his gang members.” The SSP said that the family members of Yadav own seven licensed liquor shops. “All these shops are directly operated by the accused.

The Vadodara Vepari Vikas Association (VVVA) has appealed the shop owners to close their units by 2 pm every day. The association is also planning to take more such decisions after consulting all the members. “The cases are on the rise in the city and shop-owners are at the maximum risk. Over the last few days, many shop owners, especially in the old city, have been infected with Covid-19 and are undergoing treatment. Even those working in these shops are getting infected,” said Paresh Parikh, convenor, VVVA. “So we have appealed the shop-owners to close their shops by 2 pm daily. This way, they can get some business and also ensure that their exposure to people is reduced. This is completely voluntary,” Parikh added. The association is sending out messages to all the shop-owners urging them to follow all the Covid guidelines strictly. “The traders should ask every customer to enter the shop only after wearing a face mask and maintain maximum social distance. If we don’t follow the rules, the government may impose lockdown and it will be detrimental for our business,” Parikh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/close-shops-by-2pm-traders-body-appeals/articleshow/81937366.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Baited by oppn, S We Can, says Pinarayi||Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala went to the polls on Tuesday to elect its 15th legislative assembly, registering a turnout of 74.2% that fell 2.8% short of the last assembly elections in 2016 (77.35%), which election commission sources attributed to the Covid-19 situation. The southern districts – epicentre of the Sabarimala agitation and its emotional aftermath – reported a decline in voting percentage, leaving political parties and pundits guessing over its impact in the election. Sabarimala, interestingly, resurfaced on election-day as the main political topic with the opposition proclaiming that religious faith had been under threat from the LDF govt and the CM retorting that believers of all faiths themselves thought otherwise. District-wise, Kannur (77.8%), Kozhikode (78.3%) and Palakkad (76.1%) recorded the highest polling figures in this election while Pathanamthitta registered the least (67.1%). In the 2016 assembly election too, the highest voter turnout was recorded in Kozhikode (81.89%) and the lowest in Pathanamthitta (71.66%). The byelection to the Malappuram Lok Sabha constituency, held along with the assembly polls, also saw 74.53% polling. The election witnessed a tight contest between the two rival fronts in most constituencies while the BJP-led NDA put up a decent fight in many seats. As many as 26 incidents of law and order violations -- including attacks on polling officials and clashes between political parties -- were reported from across the state. Police have registered 10 FIRs in connection with these incidents. At Kattayikkonam in Kazhakkoottam constituency in the capital, clashes occurred between BJP and CPM activists, in which four BJP activists were injured. BJP candidate Sobha Surendran protested against the incident in front of the booth while LDF candidate and devaswom minister Kadakampally Surendran alleged that police had sided with the BJP. At Payyanur in Kannur, the presiding officer of a booth Mohammed Ashraf Kalathil was manhandled by some persons, reportedly after he denied permission for a voter who sought to use a ration card as an identity document to vote. Ration card is not among the list of documents prescribed by the election commission for voting. At Nedumkandam in Idukki, police detained a group of 12 people who were trying to travel to Tamil Nadu reportedly to cast their votes there. Some of them had already cast their votes in Idukki. Police took them into preventive custody under Section 151 CrPC, after finding a voting ink eraser in their vehicle. A case was registered under Section 171F of the IPC against a person who attempted bogus voting in Thazhe Chovva in Kannur. At Kallambalam in the capital, some BJP activists attacked a police inspector. UDF candidate in Taliparamba V P Abdul Rasheed alleged that some CPM activists tried to block some women voters when they reached a polling booth in Andhoor municipality. He said there were no UDF polling agents in many polling booths in Andhoor, reportedly a CPM stronghold. At Kundara in Kollam, EMCC managing director Shiju Varghese who is contesting as an Independent against fisheries minister J Mercykutty Amma, alleged that there was an attempt on his life. Police have registered a case. At Thrikkaripur in Kasaragod, stones were pelted on the vehicle of UDF candidate M P Joseph. As many as 186 ballot units, 194 control units and 406 VVPAT machines were found defective during the mock poll while 150 ballot units, 150 control units, and 747 VVPAT machines had to be replaced during the course of the day. Based on the election commission's guidelines, webcasting was conducted in 20,478 booths in the state. The commission had appointed 70 general observers, 40 expenditure observers and 20 police observers besides 2,419 micro observers and three special observers in the state this time. As many as 2,02,402 polling personnel were deployed for the exercise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/baited-by-oppn-s-we-can-says-pinarayi/articleshow/81939082.cms||---

In a letter to Chahal, Satam had said in the wake of the rising cases, the beach should be shut for visitors from Friday to Sunday evening till the Covid situation in the city comes under control, since visiting the beach is definitely not an essential activity. “There is a huge gathering in the evening on Juhu beach, which may lead to further spread of virus,” Satam said.

But outside, token distribution is being done in full swing,” he said. “They have intensified token distribution now,’’ he said without naming any party. When reporters said charges of issuing tokens are being levelled against BJP, Kamal acknowledged it. “Yes. I saw copies of the tokens distributed,” he said.Kamal later visited the election office and lodged a complaint. Election officers told him that immediately after the issue came to their knowledge, a squad was sent and one person was secured with tokens.Earlier in the day, Coimbatore South Congress candidate Mayura Jayakumar complained that BJP men were distributing tokens. Jayakumar, along with a group of Congress cadres, blocked the busy Vysial Street demanding action against BJP men. “Tokens were distributed on Monday and we had complained to election authorities immediately. But no action was taken to stop the distribution and it is continuing even today,” Jayakumar said.Naam Tamilar Katchi candidate Abdul Wahab also staged a protest condemning the officials for not preventing BJP men from issuing tokens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/bribing-of-voters-rampant-in-coimbatore-south-kamal/articleshow/81939073.cms||---
---||Lucknow||UP government allows FPOs to purchase wheat directly from farmers||LUCKNOW: Even as some farmer leaders are on an agitational path and allege that mandis and MSP are under threat, the UP government on Tuesday also roped in Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) to speed up wheat procurement in the state. The department of food and civil supplies issued an order stating the FPOs would be granted permission to procure wheat after due approval of Mandi Samiti in the district. The FPOs will be eligible to purchase 60 quintal of wheat from farmers, it read. The FPOs have been divided into two categories. The FPOs in category 1, should be registered with the state government for the past one year and have a working capital of Rs 10 lakh. These FPOs will be entitled to purchase wheat from members or farmers who become shareholders by March 1. FPOs in category 2 must have a working capital of Rs 50 lakh to purchase wheat from non-members also. The DMs have been told to ensure FPOs do not default on payment. UP has around 585 FPOs, which will speed up wheat procurement as there are already 6,000 government purchase centres. Speaking to TOI, additional chief secretary, agriculture, Devesh Chaturvedi said farmers, who are members of FPOs, can directly purchase the crop from other farmers. “This move involves farmers directly and so there will be no middlemen,” he said. The ACS said that the change also relieves the state government of providing capital for purchase of crops, since it has to take loan from banks for the purpose. In case of FPOs, farmers put in their own capital and work efficiently, Chaturvedi said. The development comes a fortnight after CM Yogi Adityanath launched the UP FPO Shakti portal as part of the Kisan Kalyan Mission. The portal developed by the agriculture department with support of Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation aims to benefit farmers by linking them directly with traders, agriculture and allied departments. In fact, the government has been seeking to set up FPOs in 822 community developmental blocks in a bid to boost farmers’ income and rev up the agriculture sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-allows-fpos-to-purchase-wheat-directly-from-farmers/articleshow/81940511.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra accounts for 10% of 8cr vax doses in country||Mumbai: Maharashtra, the country’s worst-hit state, has become the first to administer more than eight million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. The state accounts for 10% of the 8.3 crore vaccine doses given in the country—the highest among states—since the January 16 rollout. Maharashtra is much ahead of Gujarat (76.9 lakh) and Rajasthan (72.9 lakh) in vaccination. Parts of the state, though, have started reeling under vaccine shortage, a point raised by public health minister Rajesh Tope with union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Tuesday. Tope told the Centre Maharashtra has scaled up vaccination to cover over 4 lakh beneficiaries in a day, but it was left with only 19 lakh doses that will suffice three-fours days. “There are many centres where vaccination has stopped due to lack of doses. People are going back just because the Centre has not supplied adequate doses. It is very embarrassing to send back senior citizens without vaccination,” he said. As on Tuesday, Maharashtra had administered vaccinated 81.2 lakh doses, including nearly 15 lakh in Mumbai. Nearly 75 lakh people have got the first dose and a little over 8 lakh both among the estimated 3 crore-plus target population. Chief secretary Sitaram Kunte chaired a meeting with top state officials to discuss ways to speed up the drive. Average vaccination is 12.3%, though districts such as Bhandara, Kolhapur, Nagpur, Mumbai, Pune, Sangli, Gondia, Washim and Wardha are vaccinating much more. Union health officials said India, which is vaccinating 26 lakh people a day, was second only to US’s 30 lakh. Within the country, Maharashtra has been contributing to over 4 lakh vaccinations since a week. Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said states have been given the flexibility to design micro strategies. Data presented by principal health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas shows the state has used 88 lakh of the 1.1 crore doses received. On Tuesday, Mumbai vaccinated 50,594, taking the count to 14.6 lakh.

---||World||Russian foreign minister in Pakistan, Afghanistan talks to dominate agenda||ISLAMABAD: Russia's foreign minister arrived Tuesday in Pakistan for a two-day visit expected to focus on efforts to bring peace to neighboring Afghanistan. Sergey Lavrov's visit comes as a May 1 deadline for US troops to leave Afghanistan in line with a deal Washington signed a year ago with the Taliban seems increasingly unlikely. The US has accelerated efforts to get a peace deal for Afghanistan but is also seeking a three-to-six month extension on the troop withdrawal deadline amid repeated statements from President Joe Biden that America wants to end its longest war. That's according to officials familiar with the talks who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations. The Taliban have warned against overstepping the deadline and threatened more attacks including an end to a moratorium on attacks against US and NATO troops. Afghanistan has seen a nationwide spike in bombings, targeted killings, and violence on the battlefield as peace negotiations in Qatar between the Taliban and the Afghan government have stalled. Lavrov heads a 13-member delegation that includes Moscow's special representative for Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov. Russia has intensified efforts to interject itself as a key player in the peace push and last month, Moscow hosted Taliban and Afghan government officials for a one-day meeting. Following a 10-year occupation and thousands of soldiers who died in Afghanistan, the Soviets negotiated their exit from Afghanistan in February, 1989, after so-called proximity talks between Afghanistan's communist government and the US-backed mujahedeen, many of whom are now in the Taliban while others are warlords linked to the Kabul government. Three years later the pro-Moscow government led by President Najibullah, who used only one name, fell to the mujahedeen. Lavrov's visit to Pakistan is the first by a Russian foreign minister in nine years. Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said in a video statement Tuesday that the visit is indicative of a closer relationship between the two countries. Russia's top diplomat arrives from India. While in Pakistan, Lavrov will meet Prime Minister Imran Khan, who recently recovered from Covid-19, as well as Pakistan's powerful army chief, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa. ``Pakistan and Russia are working together in the Afghan peace process,'' Qureshi said in the video statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/russian-foreign-minister-in-pakistan-afghanistan-talks-to-dominate-agenda/articleshow/81942400.cms||---

Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash said that the suspects obtained the fuel from Mumbai and sold it mainly to transport operators in Bhosari after adulteration. “We have arrested Kailash Punjabi, the supplier from Mumbai, and his accomplice Sudhir Baglane, who used to run the racket in Bhosari,” Krishna Prakash said. “Our investigation has revealed that Punjabi so far supplied two lakh litres of adulterated diesel to Baglane in the last three months,” the commissioner said. He said that Baglane had appointed two sub-dealers Hrishikesh Kadam and Rohan Hadape for selling the fuel. The duo used to sell the adulterated diesel mainly to the transport operators at Rs76 per litre. The duo used to sell 1,000 litres of diesel per day. “They claimed that it was bio-diesel and was cheaper than normal diesel,” Prakash said. He said that when the police team on Sunday went to arrest two more suspects, they abused and attacked two police constables. “We have filed a separate case against Shahnawaz Baig and Shaukat Baig and have arrested them,” Prakash said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/police-bust-adulterated-diesel-racket-six-in-the-net/articleshow/81938178.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Bank staffer detained from Allahabad in data theft case||PUNE: The city cybercrime police on Monday evening detained a private bank employee from Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh for allegedly taking screenshots of a dormant corporate bank account when he was working at the bank’s Mumbai branch and selling them. The police action was a part of the on-going investigation of bank data theft case, in which 15 people have been arrested so far. The case involves data theft and trading of pan-India data of dormant corporate accounts in leading private banks. Police investigations have revealed that the suspects sold the stolen data multiple times. Police had maintained that the data was not stolen from data centres, managed by IT firms, but from the banks. The seven bank accounts, whose data was compromised, had a collective sum of over Rs 216 crore. A team headed by deputy commissioner of police (cyber) Bhagyashri Navatake, inspector Machhindra Pandit and others detained the bank employee from Allahabad. He will be brought to Pune on Wednesday. Last Friday, police had arrested a transport vehicle driver, Deepak Lalji Singh (29), of Uttar Pradesh in the case. Singh, a school dropout, was arrested in a dacoity case by the Thane police last year when he had come in contact with one of the arrested men and got into data trade. According to the police, most of the targeted accounts had large funds lying unused for more than a year or so. The suspects intended to siphon off these funds using the stolen data, which included account details and PIN numbers, among others. One of the buyers of the data attempted to siphon off money from a corporate account having Rs78 crore in balance at a Chennai bank, but was unable to do so as it had an OTP setting, police said. Like the seven bank accounts whose data was traded in Pune city, the account with the Chennai bank is also owned by a company. The suspects sold data of seven bank accounts to persons located at different places across India. Two buyers even made an unsuccessful attempt to siphon off money from another corporate account having Rs100 crore balance. Due to some reason, they failed in their bid. All the 15 people arrested since March 16 are from Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Telangana. They have been granted bail by a Pune sessions court although the investigations continue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bank-staffer-detained-from-allahabad-in-data-theft-case/articleshow/81938164.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Coaching centres yet to be included under Covid norms||JAIPUR: Government guidelines for the closure of schools and colleges due to the rising number of coronavirus cases are not being implemented by coaching centres here. There are more than 50 coaching centres in the city where thousands study daily in congested rooms without any social distancing. Narain Lal Meena, home secretary, said most of the coaching centres are for class X and above, and that schools are open for these classes anyway. “We haven’t shut the entire education system, although some rules have been made. Whenever it is needed, coaching institutes will be shut as well,” said Meena. However, when the higher education institutions have been shut, then what is the logic of not putting a curb on coaching centres. Thousands of students in one room without any social distancing or proper ventilation, study for competitive examinations. Experts believe that this is a big industry, especially in Kota and Jaipur and Covid hotspots can develop there. Puneet Sharma, higher education expert said, “The requirement of these guidelines was to manage the crowded gatherings, irrespective of age. It’s like playing with words. One outbreak in such a place and it will be difficult for the government to control it. There is a need to put them under scanner as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/coaching-centres-yet-to-be-included-under-covid-norms/articleshow/81939160.cms||---

There is an estimated deficit of nearly 20,000 doses with the state getting 50,000-55,000 against a daily requirement of 70,000-plus, officials told TOI. Urban development minister Eknath Shinde on Tuesday directed agencies to ensure there is no black marketing of the critical Covid drug due to an “artificial shortage” and FDA claimed there is enough stock, but patients’ families are reporting having to scout hospitals and chemist stores for it. Naina Pawar, whose 70-year-old father is admitted at Mumbai Port Trust Hospital, searched all Covid hospitals in Marine Lines, CST and Byculla in vain till FDA officials, alerted by TOI, intervened late on Tuesday. “There is a real shortage as I couldn’t find it in at least five Covid hospitals and half a dozen chemist shops,” she said. Claiming there is no shortage, FDA commissioner Abhimanyu Kale told TOI that the state had 1.3 lakh doses as on Tuesday. Of that, 12,202 vials were with the distributors for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Public health minister Rajesh Tope, in a meeting with the Union health minister Harsh Varsdhan, asked the Centre to ensure enough supply of Remdesivir. Tope also flagged hoarding and unnecessary use of the drug. “I have come across hospitals giving Remdesivir to asymptomatic or even mild patients to make money,” he said, adding that district officials have been asked to visit private hospitals to check misuse of the drug. A committee under Dr Sudhakar Shinde has been constituted to cap Remdesivir price. Doctors at the LifeLine Medicare Hospital in Kandivli said they didn’t have a single dose of Remdesivir as on Tuesday evening. Dr Shilpa Ambekar, hospital head, said they had nearly 75 patients, of whom 45-odd were on the drug. “I have 20 patients who need the dose at night, but we don’t have the stock. We had no choice but to tell the relatives to procure it using their contacts,” she said. Ambekar said she got messages from some stockists claiming they could arrange for stocks for a higher price, but she declined. Ranjit Ranawat, owner of Red Rose Chemist in south Mumbai, said they haven’t received any Remdesivir stocks in the past 10 days. Around Tuesday noon, Sanjeevani Hospital in Malad, which has over 100 patients, had run out of Remdesivir. “Nearly 50% are on the drug,” said hospital head Dr Sunil Agarwal. It had placed orders for 200 vials on Saturday, which finally arrived on Tuesday evening. An FDA official said the state was receiving a daily supply of up to 55,000 doses but the demand was way more. “Many companies, which had slowed down manufacturing, are now increasing production again,” the official said. Six pharmaceutical companies are currently manufacturing Remdesivir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hospitals-patient-families-flag-remdesivir-shortage/articleshow/81940578.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Zero vax stock to halt drive in many districts||NAGPUR/MUMBAI: Despite claims from the Centre of adequate vaccine doses, vaccination is set to come to a halt in several districts from Wednesday due to shortage. The vaccination programme in Gondia is set to stop on Wednesday as it was not left with any stocks after Tuesday’s drive. Akola, Yavatmal, Buldhana and Washim—all in Amravati Division—along with Nagpur Rural and Nagpur’s Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) have stocks for one more day. Without fresh supplies, they will stop vaccinating recipients from Thursday. Mumbai has vaccine doses to last only 3-4 days while Covaxin has been out of supply in most centres. A state official said the Centre was not replenishing stock frequently, leading to this situation. In Mumbai, a civic official confirmed they were worried about stocks. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani had said on Monday the city had 2.3 lakh Covishield doses, of which over 50,000 doses were utilised on Tuesday. Data showed less than 300 people were given Covaxin. Dr Vidya Thakur, medical superintendent of Rajawadi Hospital, said they don’t have any doses of Covaxin. Officials from Gondia told TOI the district had to reduce the number of centres from 104 to 80 on Monday due to shortage of doses. Officials of Amravati division said the four districts have no vaccine. “Instructions have been given to all districts to stop vaccination at primary health centres in villages and continue only at district general hospitals and rural hospitals on Wednesday. If no fresh stock is received by Thursday, no one will get vaccinated. Amravati district has doses for two more days,” they said. The Nagpur zilla parishad store room was emptied on April 4. State immunisation officer D N Patil said, “Today, I do not have any stock. The Centre needs to continuously replenish. We are touching over 4 lakh vaccination daily.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-zero-vax-stock-to-halt-drive-in-many-districts/articleshow/81939171.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Mourners’ rush continues at Chanod despite spike in corona||VADODARA: Vipul Thakar, a priest at Chanod in Vadodara district, witnesses a rush of devotees during the pious Kartak and Chaitra months of Gujarati calendar as people perform the ‘Narayan Bali’ rituals for the salvation of their ancestors during these two months. Even as the Chaitra month is still a week away, Thakar has been remaining busy for the past few months as the village, popularly known as Prayagraj of south, has been flooded with rush of devotees as people are thronging to the ‘triveni sangam’ of Narmada, Orsang and Gupt Saraswati rivers here for the post-death rituals of their kins. The Covid-19 pandemic has not only changed the lifestyles of people but also the way the age-old post-death rituals have to be performed by the kin of the deceased. Earlier, the rituals which used to be performed at home in presence of relatives and close friends are now being preferred to be done at Chanod in presence of just minimal number of people. “The 12th and 13th day rituals are very important in Hindu culture, but due to the fear of coronavirus only a few people of the family come here and perform all rituals on a single day,” said Thakar. Another priest said that earlier people used to visit Chanod only for immersion of ashes. “But as the cases are increasing, people living in the city do not prefer to gather their relatives or call the priest at home. Instead, a few people whose presence in the rituals are necessary, come and leave after the ceremonies are over,” he added. With the rising number of devotees, the boatmen too are seeing a surge in their incomes. “After the lockdown, we were operating only 50 out of 100 boats in two shifts so that Covid protocols are followed, but lately the number of devotees has risen, so we are operating 45 boats in one shift,” said Jignesh Machhi, the treasurer of Navik Shramjivi Mandal. He added that the boatmen were anticipating a drop in income due to the pandemic, but the scenario has changed in the last couple of months. “In January, we used to ferry 1,000 people daily but now we are getting at least 1,500 people daily and the number drastically increases on Sunday and Thursday,” Machhi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/rush-continues-at-chanod-despite-surge-in-ncov-cases/articleshow/81937421.cms||Jay Pachchigar

Wadekar defeated the Maha Vikas Aghadhi candidate, Lata Rajguru. The election was conducted online, in which Wadekar got 97 votes against 61 secured by Rajguru. The outgoing deputy mayor of Pune, BJP corporator Saraswati Shendge, had resigned from her post last month after her tenure ended. The RPI, in alliance with the BJP in Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), had staked claim for the post. A group of BJP corporators wanted to retain the post with the party. So, the election of the new deputy mayor drew attention. The BJP is the single largest party in the PMC with 97 corporators. The RPI has five corporators. They had contested the election on the BJP’s party symbol in the 2017 municipal elections.

---||Jaipur||Bypoll campaign: BJP cautious on SOPs||JAIPUR: The BJP is taking extra precaution in calling its star campaigners for assembly by-polls from outside Rajasthan after hitting out at the Congress leaders for not following the mandatory RT-PCR test rule. The party has decided to call its campaigners just once and to take them at all three bypoll-bound constituencies. The star campaigners are BJP party in-charge Arun Singh, Union ministers Arjun Ram Meghwal, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and Kailash Meghwal, Rajya Sabha MP Bhupendra Singh and former BJP president Om Prakash Mathur. They are expected to visit seats after April 10. The BJP has demanded that Congress in-charge of Rajasthan Ajay Maken make his RT-PCR test public since he entered Rajasthan from Delhi via Udaipur on Tuesday and campaigned in Rajsamand. BJP has taken a moral position on Covid-19 protocol by seeking RT-PCR test reports from chief minister Ashok Gehlot, state Congress president Govind Singh Dotasra and MLA Tonk Sachin Pilot who have visited outside the state for poll campaigns in poll-bound states. Even BJP party in-charhe Arun Singh who is listed on the top of the list of star campaigners have questioned the free movement of Congress leaders is in no mood to make a similar mistake. Following its stand, BJP state president Satish Poonia has asked the Congress party in-charge in Rajasthan Ajay Maken to make it RT-PCR test public since he has arrived in Rajasthan via Udaipur. “The Congress government doesn’t have the moral courage to implement Covid-19 protocol which their leaders including Gehlot is blatantly violating it. Ideally, they should have been displaying their medical reports so that they can general public can take the inspiration from them,” said Poonia. The calculated stand taken by the party will make star campaigners more careful to ensure they follow all guidelines. Shekhawat is among the top star campaigner is busy travelling Tamil Nadu and West Bengal for polls. On Tuesday, the Union minister was in Bengal with BJP candidates filing their nominations. Meghwal, who was busy in the polls in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, will straight make its way to Sujangarh in the coming days. “All-star campaigners who are heading from outside are clear about the guidelines and they will not give Congress any ammunition to use against us,” said a party source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bypoll-campaign-bjp-cautious-on-sops/articleshow/81939166.cms||---

SP Barabanki Yamuna Prasad said police will interrogate him once he reaches Banda jail. In the meantime, police are working on more evidence and involvement of others in the case. Dismissing reports that the engine and chassis numbers of the ambulance were found tampered with when the vehicle was seized by police in Punjab, Prasad said both the serial numbers were intact and there was nothing on the vehicle that could suggest that it was a bullet-proof one, he added. He also confirmed that the details of the vehicle brought to Barabanki had matched with the details of the ambulance registered here. The ambulance reached Barabanki on Tuesday evening where a team of experts from the motor training division of the police and road transport departments examined it. Police are also tracing the dealer from where the vehicle was purchased and the fake documents passed after alleged approval of RTO Barabanki. A team under Dy SP Haidergarh Naveen Kumar Singh, which left on Saturday for Punjab, is still camping there and trying to get more details about the ambulance and how it reached there from Barabanki. Another team of an inspector and two constables drove back the ambulance to Barabanki. ADG, Lucknow zone, SN Sabat said that technical teams will examine, and weigh the vehicle and check all the parts before reaching a conclusion. Source privy to the probe told TOI that new tyres were found in the vehicle, while climate control air-conditioners were installed in it. Leather upholstery had been used inside, which is rare in an ambulance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-police-ready-with-docus-to-grill-mukhtar/articleshow/81940563.cms||---

No individual has the right to make a fun of any custom or rites of another community. Prima facie, above tweets show disregard against Muslim women and community,” metropolitan magistrate Bhagawat T Zirape said. Zargar was pregnant when arrested and subsequently granted bail. The court’s order came after a complaint by Ali Kaashif Khan Deshmukh alleged the June 2020 tweets spread hatred and disaffection towards Muslims publicly. He alleged that Rohatgi defamed women of the community and poked fun at principles of the Holy Book. In a two-page order, the court said technical investigation of the tweets was necessary to proceed. “Such an investigation can be conducted through police only,” it said.

These harvest festivals mark the beginning of new year for different communities. This is for the second time in a row that the programmes organised by Bengali Club on Poila Baisakh (to be celebrated on April 15) stand cancelled. Members of Bengali Club have decided not to organise programmes and have urged people to celebrate the festival at their homes. “Though annual dance-drama programmes at Bengali Club have been postponed, traditional puja will be performed by people at their homes to pray for prosperity of our trade and business which has been badly affected due to Covid-19. Special dishes will be prepared and people will wish each other ‘Shubho Noboborsho’ on phone,” said Arun Banerjee, president of Bengali Club & Youngmen’s Association. UP Sindhi Samaj will also mark their new year, Cheti Chand, on April 13 in a subdued manner. Earlier, Sindhi Samaj used to take out processions of more than 15 tableaux from Alambagh’s Shiv Shanti Ashram to Hazratganj. While the procession and cultural programmes have been cancelled, the community members will perform traditional puja of Lord Jhulelal at 7pm in their homes and light earthen lamps. “Since the traditional way of celebrating the festival includes worshipping the lord on the banks of a river, only a handful of our community members will visit the Gomti for puja,” said Ashok Motiyani, president of UP Sindhi Samaj. Sindhis believe Jhulelal to be ‘Varunaavtar’ (incarnation of Lord Varuna). Sikh and Keralites in the city are still deciding their plans for Baisakhi (April 13) and Vishu (April 14) celebrations. The Nagar kirtan from Gurdwara Naka Hindola on April 11 is likely to be cancelled. Kerela Samajam may also cancel cultural programmes to mark Vishu Kani festival if Covid-19 cases continue to rise. However, city gurdwaras and Lord Ayyappa temple will remain open for devotees with Covid-19 protocol in place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-cloud-hovers-over-celebration-of-harvest-festivals/articleshow/81940583.cms||Aditi Singh
---||Jaipur||2nd wave: Rajasthan to see rush of migrants from Maharashtra and Gujarat||JAIPUR: The bordering areas in the state are gearing up to face waves of migrant labourers expected from Maharashtra and Gujarat in view of the surge in the Covid-19 cases in the neighbouring states. The Dungarpur and Banswara district administration has formed check-posts in interior areas and has re-activated village committees to keep an eye on any villager returning without producing RT-PCR test. The local administration of Alwar, Dungarpur and Bharatpur has deployed extra police and health workers to expedite the checking of mandatory RT-PCR test from the commuters entering Rajasthan. Confirming the migration of labourers, Krishanpal Singh Chouhan, additional collector of Dungarpur, said that native citizens working as labourers in other states have started returning from the past week due to the fear of the long period of the second wave. “Some are coming via border while many are heading home through interiors to avoid test reports. The village-level monitoring committees have been reporting on such visitors who are serving notice of compulsory 14-day home quarantine,” said Chouhan. The work doesn’t end here. The committees have been informing four neighbours of a person under home quarantine to report if he/she steps out of their house. The administration doesn’t have the absolute numbers but is expecting the return of villagers to swell in the coming days. Similar is the case in Banswara. B L Suthar, SDM Kaushalgarh in Banswara, said that they have appointed principals of all schools as the observer to report on the movement of an outsider in the village. “Learning the lessons from Covid-19 first wave we have activated a strong network at village level to ensure that no one enters without a test. Already we are paying the price of a native of one village came from Rajkot a week ago has turned out to be a super spreader in his and nearby villages since he has attended a funeral,” said Suthar. The sizeable tribal population from Dungarpur and Banswara works in Maharashtra and Gujarat. On the second day, the traffic woes continue at Ratanpur and Shahjahanpur border as the police and health workers literally checking all commuter’s RT-PCR test. The police have started making an announcement through loudspeakers to keep their RT-PCR ready and those who don’t have it must be return.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2nd-wave-raj-to-see-rush-of-migrants-from-maha-guj/articleshow/81939169.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Facebook friend clicks Thaltej woman’s nude pics, rapes her||AHMEDABAD: A 21-year-old woman from Thaltej has accused a man she met on a social media platform of taking her nude photographs, raping her, and blackmailing her into signing a live-in agreement with him. She claimed that he later refused to marry her and posted her intimate photographs as well as videos online. In her complaint, the woman, who works at an optician’s shop on Shilaj Road, said that she befriended accused Harshwardhan Chakravarty, a cook based in Deesa town of Banaskantha, in March 2020 on Facebook. Few months into their friendship, they fell in love. “One day, Chakravarty made a video call to me and asked me to remove my clothes. I hesitated at first. However, he assured me that he would not take any screenshot, and I did as he asked,” she said in the FIR. In November, the complainant and accused met at a tattoo shop on Drive-In Road. In December 2020, he told her that he would marry her after getting his parents’ consent. “On December 12, he asked me to meet him, I refused as I was busy. That’s when he said that he had my nude photographs. He had taken screenshots during our video call and threatened to make them viral,” she told police. In her complaint, she alleged that Chakravarty picked her up from her place and took her to a hotel on Sarkhej-Sanand highway where he offered her sedative-laced cold drink. “I consumed it and fell unconscious. When I woke up, I found that he had raped me. Chakravarty also shot a video of the act which he used to blackmail and rape her again at another hotel near Ellisbridge,” she stated in her FIR. She told police that he then took her to court on December 14 and forced her to sign a live-in agreement. “However, he later refused to marry me. He also posted the objectionable photographs and and videos on social medial platforms on March 17,” said the complainant, who approached Vastrapur police and filed a complaint of rape against Chakravarty.

Around 300 resident doctors from across Gujarat have already signed the petition. According to the doctors, usually, the stipend is increased every three years. The petition states that even after they have completed three years, the the state government is not listening to them for this increment. “Central government and even state government is decorating the bureaucrats by giving them medal of honour who even don’t know how we are managing Covid-19 pandemic,” the petition states. “None of the resident doctors got any medal of honour from Gujarat government so far. Many of the resident doctors got ill, many didn’t visit their home for months, many got Covid-19, many lost their families by infecting them because of bad management of many institutes which did not provide them with an isolated hotel stay,” the petition signed by students of medical colleges of Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, Rajkot among others, states. “But we, resident doctors have not complained about anything. Even after multiple extra hours duty, we did not complain. But this time we will not stay silent,” one of the petitioners said, adding that stipend increment is their right.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/resident-docs-fight-for-hike-in-stipend/articleshow/81937441.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Give drug in OPDs to home-isolated patients, says IMA||The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has suggested that the use of Remdesivir be allowed for selected home-isolated patients on an OPD basis, either at clinics or hospitals, reports Umesh Isalkar. Currently, the drug is given only to those hospitalised with Covid. The suggestion by IMA members at a recent meeting with the Pune Covid task force and civic health officials is significant as a large chunk of patients during the second wave has opted for home isolation. If some of these patients experience drops in blood oxygen levels, they’ll have to seek out hospital beds to get Remdesivir. “Giving Remdesivir on an OPD basis is medically termed as ambulatory day-care administration. This is quite prevalent in western countries. If allowed, this will cut down hospitalisation and reduce the burden on hospitals,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the IMA’s Hospital Board of India (HBI). In the OPD administration of Remdesivir, a home-isolated patient who is not hypoxic (low blood oxygen saturation) but has inducible hypoxia (after a three-minute or six-minute walk test) and whose chest CT score is 7 (or slightly above) with pre-existing health conditions is given the drug via drip at hospitals or clinics without being admitted. Critical care experts urged caution. “If given in haste, the drug may cause complications. Remdesivir needs to be given under strict medical supervision and requires monitoring of a patient’s blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation in blood,” said Ruby Hall clinic chief intensivist Kapil Zirpe. Sanjeev Wavare, PMC’s nodal officer for Covid-19, said, “The suggestion is currently under consideration.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-give-drug-in-opds-to-home-isolated-patients-says-ima/articleshow/81940613.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Meerut||6 cubs take tiger count in UP’s Amangarh Reserve to 27: Census||BIJNOR: In a just-concluded census conducted with the help of 90 trap cameras, 27 tigers have been spotted in Amangarh Tiger Reserve (ATR), the buffer zone of Corbett Tiger Reserve, in UP’s Bijnor. This figure includes six cubs as well, revealed the data disclosed by Bijnor’s forest division. The addition of six cubs in the census indicates that they are at least a year old and have weathered the jungle conditions. Till 2014, cubs were not enumerated as their mortality rate is high. Only sub-adults over 1.5 years old used to be part of the census. In 2019, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) included year-old tigers in the enumeration. “It is a healthy sign that the tigers' number is increasing year-on-year in a sustained manner,” said M Semmaran, divisional forest officer, Bijnor In the previous census conducted in 2019-2020, the number of tigers was 24. While in 2018-2019, 19 big cats were spotted in the reserve forest. The rising tiger count indicates that Amangarh has come a long way from 2012, when it was notified. At that time, 13 tigers had crossed over from Corbett and stayed on in Amargarh. The tiger census has also revealed a sizable presence of other animals, including leopards, jackals, wild boars and elephants. Their photos were also caught in the 500 pictures clicked by the trap cameras set up for the tigers. The thriving population of tigers, the top predator at the apex of the food chain, is also a pointer to a balanced ecosystem between prey herbivores and the vegetation upon which they feed. In this context, Semmaran said a good prey base and plenty of water available in Amangarh is a major factor for the growing population of tigers. Added to this are some man-made inputs. The forest department ensures the water holes are maintained round the year. Patrolling and a network of informers by staff helps keep poachers at bay, the DFO said. “We have also been on a very high vigil to curb poaching of animals in the area. It is a challenge as Amangarh reserve borders with Uttarakhand and poachers can easily move from one state to another through the heavily forested area. To ensure effective surveillance, we regularly exchange information with our Uttarakhand counterparts,” added Semmaran. The efforts are bearing fruit. Now, plans are afoot to develop ATR into a tourism site on the lines of Corbett. “We have sent a proposal for the same to the state authorities,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/6-cubs-take-tiger-count-in-ups-amangarh-reserve-to-27-census/articleshow/81937452.cms||Harveer Dabas

---||World||Benjamin Netanyahu gets first crack at forming new Israel government||JERUSALEM: Israel's president on Tuesday handed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the difficult task of trying to form a government from the country's splintered parliament, giving the embattled leader a chance to prolong his lengthy term in office while on trial for corruption charges. In his announcement, President Reuven Rivlin acknowledged that no party leader had the necessary support to form a majority coalition in the 120-seat Knesset. He also noted that many believe Netanyahu is unfit to serve in light of his legal problems. Nonetheless, Rivlin said that there was nothing in the law preventing Netanyahu from serving as prime minister. After consulting with the 13 parties in the newly elected parliament, Rivlin said that Netanyahu had the best chance of any candidate of forming a new government. ``No candidate has a realistic chance of forming a government that will have the confidence of the Knesset,'' Rivlin said. But, he added, Netanyahu has a ``slightly higher chance'' of being able to. ``I have decided to entrust him with the task,'' Rivlin said from Jerusalem. Rivlin added that the choice was ``not an easy decision on a moral and ethical basis.'' With that, Rivlin nudged forward the twin dramas over the country's future and Netanyahu's fate, giving Israel's longest-serving premier a fresh chance to try to salvage his career. Netanyahu now has up to six weeks to try to cobble together a coalition during his trial. Early reactions from the premier's sworn rivals highlighted the difficult road ahead. Yair Lapid, leader of the party that won the second-highest number of seats, acknowledged that the law left Rivlin ``no choice,'' but in the same tweet denounced the development as ``a shameful disgrace that tarnishes Israel.'' A court ruling could be months or even years away. The proceedings are expected to take place up to three days a week, an embarrassing and time-consuming distraction that will shadow Netanyahu's appeals to his rivals. Netanyahu holds the most support _ 52 seats _ in Israel's Knesset. But that is still short of a 61-seat majority. He is likely to use his powers of persuasion to try to lure a number of opponents, including a number of former close aides who have vowed never to serve under him again, with generous offers of powerful government ministries or legislative committees. Parties representing 45 members supported Yair Lapid, while Yamina, with seven seats, nominated its own leader, Naftali Bennett. Three parties holding a total of 16 seats made no recommendation. Rivlin's decision merges questions of Netanyahu's legal and political future in what's perhaps the starkest political challenge of his career. In court, he faces fraud, breach of trust and bribery charges in three separate cases. Proceedings resumed Tuesday, though the premier was not expected to appear in court. A key witness on Monday cast Netanyahu as an image-obsessed leader who forced a prominent news site to help his family and smear his opponents. Netanyahu denies all charges and in an nationally televised address accused prosecutors of persecuting him in an effort to drive him out of office. ``This is what a coup attempt looks like,'' he said. Monday's court session focused on the most serious case against Netanyahu _ in which he is accused of promoting regulations that delivered hundreds of millions of dollars of profits to the Bezeq telecom company in exchange for positive coverage on the firm's popular news site, Walla. Ilan Yeshua, Walla's former chief editor, described a system in which Bezeq's owners, Shaul and Iris Elovitch, repeatedly pressured him to publish favorable things about Netanyahu and smear the prime minister's rivals. The explanation he was given by the couple? ``That's what the prime minister wanted,'' he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/benjamin-netanyahu-gets-first-crack-at-forming-new-israel-government/articleshow/81942404.cms||---

The teachers said they had been first appointed in 2011 and that by now they have around 10 years teaching experience. “They had appointed us under the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan on a part-time basis in government high schools and middle schools. But we are handling as much workload as the full-time teachers. As these government schools do not have sufficient teachers, we are also teaching other subjects besides those for which we were appointed,” Vasu Desai said. They said they are only getting paid Rs 15,000 to 16,000 a month and though the CM had announced enhanced salaries of Rs 22,000, they are yet to get it. “Some states have already absorbed part-time teachers. And we are just 54 of us,” Gangaram Lambar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/absorb-us-say-part-time-govt-teachers/articleshow/81940619.cms||---

The Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government told the SC that the HC’s order breached the norms of federal structure of governance by entrusting the probe into Singh’s allegations to a central agency, thus indirectly suggesting that Mumbai police or the inquiry committee headed by a former Bombay HC judge were not competent to inquire into the allegations. The state government said that given the political situation in the country, where central agencies were often misused to destabilise non-BJP governments in states, the HC’s decision to entrust the preliminary probe into Singh's allegations could provide a handle to the Union government to wreak vengeance. Though Shiv Sena had contested the Maharashtra elections as a BJP partner, it broke ranks and formed the government in coalition with NCP and Congress. It said the HC should have taken note of the fact that the Maharashtra government had withdrawn general consent for CBI probe into cases within the state. It said the HC erred by directing a CBI probe through an interim order. Though the HC and the SC had powers to direct CBI probe even when a state had withdrawn general consent, it could be done only after hearing all parties and through a final order, the Maharashtra government said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/maharashtra-anil-deshmukh-move-sc-against-hcs-cbi-probe-order/articleshow/81942407.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Justice Bobde has advocated the use of AI in judicial work and has pushed for making the justice delivery system efficient through the help of technology. He said the software SUPACE (Supreme Court Portal for Assistance in Courts Efficiency) is unique and is a perfect blend of human and machine intelligence. “We are not going to let the use of AI spill over to decision making. It will fully retain the autonomy and discretion of judges to decide cases, though at a much faster pace at which the readiness of information is made available by AI... I believe that an artificial intelligence system that decides the case could be disastrous to the judiciary,” the CJI said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/now-judges-can-take-help-of-artificial-intelligence/articleshow/81942409.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

In her petition, Afsan Ansari alleged that her husband was attacked earlier as well and there is all likelihood that he will again be targeted after he is shifted from Punjab to Uttar Pradesh jail. She also pointed out various incidents in the past when attempts were allegedly made to eliminate her husband. She alleged that her husband is a witness in several cases in which members of the present ruling party are accused and “grave pressure is being exerted to have him killed”. The Supreme Court had on March 26 directed transfer of the politician from Punjab to Uttar Pradesh to face trial in multiple cases pending in the state after noting that Punjab refused to hand over Ansari’s custody 26 times on trivial medical grounds. The court had observed that it cannot be a “helpless bystander” when the rule of law is being challenged with impunity. The court allowed the plea of the Uttar Pradesh government which was forced to approach the Supreme Court after its attempt to get Ansari back to the state failed as Punjab refused to hand him over. The court had directed that the politician’s custody be handed over Uttar Pradesh within two weeks and he be shifted to district jail, Banda in Uttar Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/wife-fears-for-mukhtars-life-in-up-jail-moves-sc/articleshow/81942416.cms||---

The Centre will spend close to Rs 8,000 crore for the upgrade. Further, majority of the proposed national highways would be converted into six lanes from the existing four and two lanes. Taking the state government’s requests into consideration, the Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari got the surveys conducted and gave his green signal for up-gradation. The Centre directed the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to get the detailed project reports (DPRs) ready for taking up modernisation works. The Centre had already issued gazette notification by recognizing seven state highways as national highways and had given them new NH numbers. According to NHAI sources, the Centre is willing to launch developmental works on the newly-recognized national highways soon after getting the DPRs ready. The conversion of highway stretch between Nagar Kurnool in Telangana and Nandyal in AP is going to be a big boon for the Rayalaseema region. The Centre had named it as NH-167K and proposed to take up development of six-lane highway from Nagar Kurnool, Kollapur, Ramapur, Mandugala, Sivapuram, Karivena and Nandyal. A major bridge over river Krishna (Somasila-Siddeswaram) would also be part of the project which connects several flood hit-areas in Kurnool with plain areas. The river-over-bridge would also provide access to many places in Kurnool district with neighbouring villages in Telangana. The 110-km long highway is expected to reduce the distance between Tirupati and Hyderabad by 80 km. While the 90-km stretch is part of Telangana, remaining 30-km stretch is located in AP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/centre-to-upgrade-10-state-highways-to-natl-highways/articleshow/81942951.cms||Samdani MN
