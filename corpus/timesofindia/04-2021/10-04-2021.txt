It further cautioned that the commission, in cases of breach, would not hesitate in banning public meetings, rallies etc. of the defaulting candidates/star campaigners/ political leaders without any further reference. Pointing to the recent rise in Covid cases, EC said instances had come to its notice where norms of social distancing, wearing of masks etc have been flouted in disregard to the Commission’s guidelines dated August 21, 2020 on Covid-safe poll campaigning. “Instances of star campaigners/political leaders/candidates not observing Covid protocols including non-wearing of masks themselves at stage or while campaigning have come to notice. By doing so, the political parties and candidates are exposing themselves as well as the public attending such election meetings to the grave danger of infection,” noted EC. The poll panel sought the fullest cooperation from the political parties and candidates in strictest observance of the protocols so that all the Covid guidelines are adhered to by all the participants including organizers in the electioneering. As per Covid guidelines issued in view of Bihar polls last year, EC had asked parties and candidates concerned to ensure that all Covid-related requirements like face masks, sanitizers, thermal scanning etc. are fulfilled. It had then added that non-compliance of instructions during the period of public interface would attract action under the Disaster Management Act and Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/set-example-by-maintaining-social-distancing-wearing-masks-ec-to-political-leaders/articleshow/81994932.cms||Bharti Jain

Despite admitting that its tax revenue target for the current fiscal was “not attainable”, the government has committed to a Rs 5.963 trillion target for the next budget, against the Rs 4.691 trillion revised target for the current fiscal. The documents made public by the IMF on Thursday on the second, third, fourth, and fifth reviews of the EFF that concluded last month revealed that the government has set ambitious targets for revenue generation. The documents also suggested increasing levy on oil products to the maximum level (Rs 30 per litre) this year and next year to collect about Rs 510 billion this year instead of the budgeted target of Rs 450 billion. Under the agreement, Pakisatan would also bring down the current year’s development programme to Rs1.169 trillion against the budgeted target of Rs1.324 trillion. The government has also given an undertaking to make adjustments in gas tariff and not to consider any tax exemption or tax amnesty in future. Moreover, the government has committed to ensuring transparency of its Covid-related spending. It said that information about contracts awarded and beneficial ownership would be uploaded on a publicly accessible website by the end of April, adding that the procurement of Covid-related supplies and payments would be audited by the Auditor General of Pakistan and published on the finance ministry’s website also by the end of April. Pakistan will meet a dozen conditions in six months to stay in the $6 billion IMF programme but its economic endurance still hinges upon an $11 billion continued Chinese lifeline. These conditions are among 11 actions that the government will take by September this year. They are in addition to the five prior actions that it took to convince the IMF board to approve its case. They included the introduction of the Rs140-billion mini-budget, an increase in electricity prices by Rs 4.97 per unit from December 2020 to January 2021 on account of quarterly and annual tariffs, introduction of amendments to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Act, and the approval of the circular debt management plan by the cabinet. According to the IMF, Pakistan gross external financing needs — the funds that it needs to pay off foreign loans and finance its imports — amount to $27 billion over the next 12 months. These financing needs, the IMF stated, will be met by support from China’s $10.8 billion, the UAE’s $2 billion, the World Bank’s $2.8 billion, the G20's $1.8 billion initiative, the Asian Development Bank's $1.1 billion, and the Islamic Development Bank’s $1 billion, Pakistan informed the IMF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/to-stay-in-imfs-6b-programme-pak-goes-overboard-on-tax-mop-up-target/articleshow/81995441.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The US had submitted a request to extradite 54-year-old Motiwala, who uses the surname Siddiq, on charges of money laundering, heroin trafficking and extortion, which was certified by the UK home office on August 15, 2018. Following a hearing, Motiwala’s extradition was sent to the secretary of state by district judge John Zani on February 6, 2020 and his extradition was ordered on March 30, 2020. On March 24 and 25, 2021, Motiwala appealed against his extradition at the high court and the judgment was expected at any moment. However before judgment was handed down, on April 7 the Westminster magistrates’ court granted Motiwala unconditional bail, meaning he is free to leave the country, including travel to Pakistan, subject to Covid-19 restrictions. A spokesperson for Westminster magistrates’ court said: “An application on April 7 was made by the home office who informed the court that the US might be withdrawing the extradition request and so the judge gave him unconditional bail whilst we wait for further information.” A spokesperson for the Crown Prosecution Service told TOI: “The US have withdrawn the extradition request. Therefore we will not be appealing any decision to grant unconditional bail.” Motiwala, a Pakistani national who lives in Karachi, was arrested at the Hilton Hotel in Paddington on August 16, 2018 by the Metropolitan police extradition unit, whilst on a 10-year visa to the UK. He had been lodged in Wandsworth jail until Wednesday. During his extradition hearings the court had heard that he was the “CEO” of D-Company in Karachi, headed by Dawood Ibrahim, an Indian Muslim who has been in exile in Pakistan since 1993 after being implicated in the Mumbai bombings. The court heard that Motiwala reported directly to Ibrahim and that D-Company was a support system of known terrorist organisations, including Al-Qaeda and Laskshar-e-Taiba which Osama Bin Laden used for smuggling routes. The court heard that D-Company uses extortion to intimidate family members of debtors in Pakistan and India and makes 50% of its profits from this. But Motiwala always denied any involvement with D-Company and said he was a wealthy businessman. During his appeal his lawyer Edward Fitzgerald QC had alleged that since Pakistani-American FBI informants caught Motiwala in an undercover operation in Pakistan — without permission from Pakistan — the extradition was an abuse of process. He also presented a recording to the court of one of the FBI informants allegedly confessing he had fabricated charges against Motiwala at the behest of the FBI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/us-withdraws-extradition-request-for-alleged-d-company-henchman-jabir-motiwala-he-walks-free-from-jail/articleshow/81995482.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||India||Ansaar Gazwat-ul-Hind chief among 7 terrorists killed in 2 separate encounters in south Kashmir in 24 hours||SRINAGAR: Security forces gunned down seven terrorists, including Ansaar Gazwatul Hind chief Imtiyaz Shah, in two separate encounters on Friday. Shah and an associate were shot dead in Tral after fleeing from a mosque in Shopian district’s Jan Mohalla where they had been holed up along with five other terrorists who were killed there after the security forces used tear gas to smoke them out. The security forces used tear gas shells to drive the terrorists out of the mosque in order to maintain the sanctity of the place of worship. The brother of a terrorist, accompanied by the local imam, were sent into the mosque to persuade them to surrender, but they were unsuccessful, a police officer said. Meanwhile, the GoC of the Srinagar based 15 Corps, Lt Gen D P Pandey, said at a press conference here that the Army was working on a two-pronged strategy in Kashmir — to prevent local militant recruitments and to squeeze the OGW and social media network used for the radicalisation of the youth. He, however, said anyone who picked up arms would be dealt with strictly: local militants would be given a chance to surrender and, if they refused, they would be killed. Lt Gen Pandey was addressing his first press conference as GOC 15 Corps at the Srinagar police control room along with IGP (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar and GoC Victor Force Rashim Bali about the encounters at Shopian and Tral. “I can feel that there is a new change and new energy. One and all want J&K to be a peaceful region. While the rest of Kashmir is peaceful, south Kashmir and some parts of central Kashmir are witnessing cycles of violence,” Lt Gen Pandey said. “Efforts are on to address the situation. We need cooperation from the general public. Our youth are being radicalised and people must help us in stopping the trend.” He said some parents whose children had become militants had approached the Army requesting it to “get their children back and rehabilitate them even if they need to be lodged in jail”. Asked whether the local militancy graph was high this year, the GoC said local militant recruitment was far lower this year compared to previous years. Briefing the media about the two separate gun battles, IGP (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar said, “In the Shopian operation we had to be very patient. We followed all SoPs. We allowed the maulvi of the local masjid in which the militants were hiding to try twice to persuade the militants to surrender in the night. We also brought the brother of a militant; his request for surrender was also turned down. We brought the parents of the militants in the morning, but the militants refused to surrender,” the IGP said, adding that in the Shopian gunfight no explosives, not even grenades, were used. “We used tear gas shells. In the ensuing gunfight, five militants were killed — two from Hizbul Mujahideen, one from LeT and two from AGH. All were categorised as militants.” He said that two militants, including AGH chief Imtiyaz Shah, had fled from the Shopian encounter site during the initial cordoning-off after throwing grenades. “We developed leads and found that the two had fled to Nowbagh area of Tral. Today, early morning, a cordon operation was launched in an open area where Imtiyaz and his aide were killed,” he said. Seven AK assault rifles and two pistols were recovered from the seven slain militants. He said that in the Shopian operation the sanctity of the mosque was maintained and the place of worship suffered minimum damage. The IGP identified the militants slain in Shopian as Muzamil Tantry, who had become a militant in August 2019; Adil Lone, who picked up arms in July 2019; Younish Ahmed Khanday, who joined militancy last November; and Basit Bhat, who picked up the gun in June last year. He said the fifth militant had not yet been identified. The IGP said AGH chief Imtiyaz Shah, shot dead in the Trial encounter, had been active since April 2019 and had been tasked to target the Amarnath yatra in Tral area. The identity of Imtiyaz’s aide is being ascertained. Four soldiers, including an officer, were injured during the operation, the GOC, 15 Corps, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ansaar-gazwat-ul-hind-chief-among-7-terrorists-killed-in-2-separate-encounters-in-south-kashmir-in-24-hours/articleshow/81995562.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Addressing the third and fourth annual convocation of the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) in Jammu, Naidu said some people from the “neighbourhood” had always tried to create disturbances because they didn’t want India to progress. “My advice to some friends, who are trying to give unasked advice to us in between and make commentaries to confine themselves to their domestic problems... We are capable of taking care of our own problems and they need not worry about us,” he added, The Vice-President also made special mention of J&K and said, “My dear youngsters, where you are studying is an integral part of India. And we are of the opinion we are capable of solving our problems. No country for that matter has any business to interfere or make comments on the internal affairs of another country or any other country. We all believe in democracy and civilization.” He covertly attacked Pakistan, saying, “If you are really civilized you are not expected to interfere in the affairs of any other country. I am very clear about it.” Naidu remarked that some people from the neighbourhood always try to create problems and disturbances for India. “We should not allow them to succeed, he said and added that we should be guided by the spirit of national integration — nation first, party and profession next and self last. That should be our attitude, nation first attitude irrespective of caste, creed, sex, religion and region,” he said. Asserting that the country is moving forward, he said, “The entire world is looking towards India and (the country is being respected worldwide.” He added that India was the most favourite destination for investment. “With the ease of doing business, the reforms brought in by the Prime Minister and the new ideas, the world is looking towards India and we have the potential to take advantage of that. See to it that we become a strong, stable, peaceful and prosperous nation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-integral-part-of-india-vice-president-m-venkaiah-naidu/articleshow/81995568.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||India||Media advisory is for safety of reporters: Kashmir Police||SRINAGAR: Two days after issuing a media advisory, urging reporters to desist from going near encounter sites and covering the proceedings live, Kashmir Police on Friday reiterated that the advisory was meant for ensuring safety of media persons. The advisory was issued late on Wednesday evening. Addressing a press conference, IGP (Kashmir range) Vijay Kumar said Article 19(1) of the Constitution (right to freedom of speech and expression) doesn’t give an absolute right and that it is subject to reasonable restrictions. As such, reporters cannot put their lives as well the lives others in danger while performing their professional work, he added. The IGP, however, said that district SSPs have been directed to give reporters encounter updates. Kumar said if reporters go closer to encounter sites, the same may disturb the men involved in anti-militancy operations and live coverage of the proceedings may trigger law and order situation in other areas. Notably, while hearing the Mumbai terror attack case, the Supreme Court had chided the electronic media for covering live the entire episode, which “put the security of the country in jeopardy”. Live coverage of the Mumbai terror attack by almost all news channels had provided clues to the Pakistani handlers, who had then directed the assailants to safer routes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/media-advisory-is-for-safety-of-reporters-kashmir-police/articleshow/81995610.cms||M Saleem Pandit

This accounts for about two-thirds of the professional networking company’s user base. Data — which includes a user’s name, emails, phone number, workplace information, and links to social media accounts hosted on the platform — have been exposed, according to Cyber News, which first reported on the breach. This comes days after data of Facebook’s users was up for sale on the dark web. LinkedIn said data has been scraped but denied it was a breach. “We have investigated an alleged set of LinkedIn data that has been posted for sale and have determined that it is actually an aggregation of data from a number of websites and companies. It does include publicly viewable member profile data that appears to have been scraped from LinkedIn. This was not a LinkedIn data breach, and no private member account data from LinkedIn was included in what we’ve been able to review,” the company said in a statement. Scraping is the process of using bots to import publicly viewable data from websites. It’s not clear how many Indian users’ information was compromised. India is the second-largest market for the company in terms of users, at 71 million, after the US, which has more than 150 million users. LinkedIn declined to provide any specific numbers around that. “Any misuse of our members’ data, such as scraping, violates LinkedIn terms of service. When anyone tries to take member data and use it for purposes LinkedIn and our members haven’t agreed to, we work to stop them and hold them accountable,” the company said. The report added that the leaked files contained only LinkedIn profile information and not more sensitive information like credit details or legal documents in the sample posted by the hacker. “While users on the hacker forum can view the leaked samples for about $2 worth of forum credits, the threat actor appears to be auctioning the much-larger 500 million user database for at least a 4-digit sum, presumably in bitcoin,” the report cautioned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/linkedin-says-user-data-scraped-and-put-for-sale-report/articleshow/81995973.cms||Avik Das

The country's active case count crossed the 1-million mark before settling to an all-time high of around 10,46,000 on Friday, even as fresh cases surged to another new peak of over 1.45 lakh. The previous highest tally of active cases in India was 10,26,945 recorded on September 17, at the peak of the first Covid wave. In tandem with the unprecedented growth in infections, active cases have shown the fastest-ever increase in recent days, rising by more than 4.3 lakh in the last eight days alone. Meanwhile, fresh cases continued to rise in the country, with 1,45,089 new infections being detected on Friday. The day's death toll from the virus stood at 774. Covid testing was also increasing, with more than 13.64 tests conducted on Thursday to detect infections, the highest since September 24 last year. Maharashtra continued to post by far the highest number of fresh cases at 58,993 on Friday, the second highest count recorded in the state. Mumbai added 9,202 cases to its tally. Cases were also surging in other parts of the country, with as many as six states registering their biggest single-day surge in infections. Leading these states was Chhattisgarh, which reported as many as 11,447 new cases on Friday, the highest count recorded in any state other than Maharashtra and Kerala. Uttar Pradesh counted 9,695 new cases, a sharp rise from Thursday's record high of 8,490. Madhya Pradesh posted 4,882 cases, another new high, while Gujarat detected 4,541 new infections. Rajasthan tally rose to 3,970 while Punjab recorded another peak at 3,459. Besides, 13 other states recorded their highest daily case tallies in 2021, including Delhi, which reported Delhi 8,521 new cases, close to the city's highest count of 8,593 reported on November 11. Karnataka posted 7,955 fresh cases, the highest since October 15. These included 5,576 cases from Bengaluru Urban alone. Tamil Nadu's tally climbed to 5,441, the most since October 7, while Bengal saw infections rise by 3,648, the highest count since November 18. Cases continued to rise in Haryana (2,994, highest since November 20), Andhra Pradesh (2,765, highest since November 3), Telangana (2,478, September 10), Bihar (2,174, August 23), Jharkhand (1,925, September 8), Odisha (1,282, November 8), Himachal Pradesh (662, December 10), Chandigarh (422, September 13) and Ladakh (91, December 6). With the pandemic on the surge again in Kerala, the state reported 5,063 new cases, the highest since February 13. The tally of active cases in the country has risen by more than five times in 28 days, since the number crossed 2 lakh on March 12. Active cases are calculated by subtracting the number of recoveries from the count of fresh cases. The actual active case count may be slightly less than the numbers given here because of migrations etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-active-cases-cross-1-million-at-all-time-high-now/articleshow/81996188.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

The centre had shut its gates after it had exhausted the last 160 doses of vaccines it had in its stock. By afternoon, police had to be called in to disperse the crowd and the access road barricaded as people continued to pour in. In Ghaziabad in the national capital region (NCR), a man had to be detained outside the District Combined Hospital for allegedly threatening staff. He was a part of a crowd protesting after those registered for vaccination on Friday were asked to go back as stocks ran out. As vaccine shortage continued to hit the inoculation drive in the midst of a surging second wave of the pandemic, in many parts of the country, people coming in for vaccination had to return without the jab. The turnout dropped significantly in Mumbai on Friday as nearly all the big public and private facilities couldn’t administer doses. Only 33,551 people could be vaccinated on Friday, down from the city’s average of 53,000 vaccinations a day. Late on Friday, BMC commissioner IS Chahal announced that private centres will not hold vaccination drives on April 10, 11 and 12. Across Maharashtra, around 3 lakh people could take the vaccine, a drop from the daily average of 4.3 lakh doses. In Kolkata, several hospitals had to turn away hopeful recipients, while a number of others shut down their vaccination centres earlier than usual as vaccine stocks began to run out. Bengal family welfare officer Ashim Das Malakar feared stocks would run dry by Sunday at the current rate of vaccination. Inoculation drive in Patna, too, was halted in many hospitals though the drive continued in bigger ones like PMCH and AIIMS-Patna. With stocks getting over, Uttar Pradesh has decided that vaccination will only be done at medical colleges and district hospitals on Saturday in the name of extensive training for the Vaccine Utsav on April 11-14.

Both corporation tax and personal income tax collections turned out to be higher than the revised estimates presented by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the budget on February 1. Against the revised target of Rs 4.46 lakh crore, corporation tax collections were estimated at Rs 4.57 lakh crore, according to the provisional data. Personal income tax numbers were better with collections estimated at Rs 4.88 lakh crore, which is over 6% higher than the revised estimates of Rs 4.59 lakh crore. “Strong campaign for Vivaad Se Vishwas Scheme, use of technology/digitisation and widening of tax base coupled by Tax Collected at Source (TCS) has contributed to higher tax collections. Also, such higher tax collections in the pandemic year correspond to a rebound in the economy and are in sync with higher GST collections,” Samir Kanabar, tax partner at EY India, said. On March 31, revenue secretary Tarun Bajaj had indicated that collections have been robust with GST data showing record mop-up in March. “The numbers are definitely more than what we had expected at the time of the revised estimates. I am impressed by resilience of the corporate sector...,” he had told TOI. Gross collections were estimated at Rs 12.06 lakh crore. The collections were lower than the budget estimate of Rs 13.2 lakh crore. The last financial year also saw a jump in refunds, which rose 43% to Rs 2.61 lakh crore. “Despite an extremely challenging year, advance tax collections for 2020-21 stand at Rs 4.95 lakh crore, showing a growth of approximately 6.7% over the immediately preceding financial year of Rs 4.64 lakh crore,” an official statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/direct-tax-collections-top-revised-estimates-by-5/articleshow/81996643.cms||---

Levels of black carbon, or soot, have shot up six times while that of ozone has trebled — both going straight from safe levels to dangerously toxic ones within a week. By Friday, black carbon levels had gone from about 1,000-2,000 microgram per cubic metre last month, before the fires started, to 10,000-12,000 microgram per cubic metre of air. The concentration of ozone, which used to be around 40-45 parts per billion then, has risen to 110-115 parts per billion now. The safe threshold for black carbon in the air is 3,000-4,000 microgram per cubic metre, while that of ozone is 40-50 parts per billion with an hourly range of 80 and an eight-hour average range of 60. High black carbon and ozone in the air can cause complications from chest pain to coughing, irritation and, on prolonged exposure, damage the heart and lungs. “Black carbon is released during incomplete combustion of fuels. Ozone is produced when poisonous gases like carbon monoxide react with sunlight,” Prof Manish Naja, head of the atmospheric science division at the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) at Nainital, told TOI. “The unusually high concentration of these gases means the air is getting more polluted and the major reason is the forest fire.” While forest fires always blaze through Uttarakhand around this time of the year, the scale of destruction this time around has been much larger. Little post-monsoon rain and no snowfall this winter have fed the inferno. “The pollution levels themselves indicate how bad the fires have been,” Naja said. And even these numbers are conservative estimates. “The ARIES campus, where the data was recorded, is a few kilometres away from Nainital. The pollution levels in the town and other areas closer to the fire would be much higher,” Naja said. “We will conduct a detailed study to document the effect of forest fires and pollution they cause.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/forest-fires-turn-uttarakhand-air-lethal/articleshow/81996892.cms||Prashant Jha

Italy, through senior advocate Suhail Dutt, informed a bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian that after negotiations with the Indian government, based on the May 21, 2020, award of the arbitral tribunal under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), it was ready to pay Rs 10 crore compensation to the kin of the dead fishermen as well as the owner of the boat, which was damaged due to firing by the Marines. The Kerala government, through senior advocate Jaideep Gupta, said the trial against the Italian Marines should not be closed till the money was deposited in the SC registry. The bench then ordered that after the amount is received by the Centre from the Italian government, the same shall be deposited in the court within one week.

As the first country in the world to have shaped a code empowering news media companies to negotiate with search and social media platforms, it set the template for other countries. Next up is a look at online advertising, chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Rod Sims, which saw the news media bargaining code through, told TOI. “The point of the code was not arbitration but to allow for proper commercial negotiations,” Sims said. “It is very difficult to have a negotiation with a monopoly… Google has 95% of the search in Australia. Facebook dominates social media with 17 million Australian users… Europeans dealt with this issue via copyright and we via market power (challenging the monopoly they had). I think our way is the better way.” ACCC had launched an inquiry in 2018 that led to the media bargaining code. “That 18-month inquiry looked at market power, digital platforms, consumer issues, advertising issues and media issues,” Sims said. “We had 23 recommendations and one of them was for the news media bargaining code.” The code focuses on three things — payment for content, notice for significant algorithm changes and transparency on what data platforms are willing to make available to news media businesses. “The code is working. Three of the four main media businesses in Australia have reached agreements. Discussions are on with two others (one of which is a conglomerate of 180 regional news media houses),” Sims said. “The bargaining power is not just restricted to Google search and Facebook social media now.” Initially, the commission had made an attempt at dissolving the monopoly by proposing a voluntary code. But it didn’t work and they decided to make it a mandatory code, which was drafted and released to the public in July 2020. And then came the pushback. “Google publicly threatened to pull all search from Australia. In the end, they didn’t. Facebook took news and emergency health information off its news feed on February 18 for nearly a week.” But on February 25 this year, the Australian Parliament passed the news media bargaining code into law and news on Facebook, too, was reinstated after the government agreed to changes in the code. “We did not change the core, just allowed more time for the process ... The underlying key features of the code remain unaffected,” said Sims. A year in, the code will be reviewed. “A one-year review by the treasury is built into the code. We will see what lessons need to be learnt. It is working as intended at the moment,” Sims said. The commission is now looking at another aspect of online monopoly — advertising. “One of the 23 recommendations (after the 18-month inquiry) was holding a digital advertising services inquiry. We were asked to take a detailed look at advertising technology,” Sims said. “We are looking at it in a comprehensive way.” The inquiry is still in its early stages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/we-dealt-with-fb-google-via-market-power-not-copyright/articleshow/81997047.cms||Priyanka A Chokhani

Repeating his promises to ‘teerth purohits’ (priests of the shrines) who had been agitating against the Devasthanam Board Act introduced by the Trivendra Rawat government — which brought the shrines under the control of the state government — the CM said that his government would now review the Act. Soon after the VHP meeting, he said, “The issue was raised at the meeting and I have assured everyone that we are going to review the Act and denotify the 51 temples that are under its purview.” The constitution of the board to manage prominent shrines in the state had been announced by former CM Trivendra in December 2019; it had led to backlash from the priests community, which had approached the Uttarakhand high court, terming it “an infringement of traditional rights of priests to manage affairs of the temples.” They were supported by BJP’s Subramanian Swamy who had argued their case in court. The HC had dismissed the priests’ petition last year after which Swamy had moved a special leave petition in the Supreme Court. CM Rawat’s announcement on Friday was welcomed by the teerth purohit community. “This is a great move. We were expecting that he will support our genuine demands and he has stayed true to his promise. This is going to create good atmosphere for Char Dham Yatra this year,” said Brijesh Sati, spokesperson of Char Dham Teerth Purohit Mahapanchayat, the body representing Char Dham priests. Another senior seer, Vasudevanand Saraswati, who was there in the VHP meet in Haridwar, said that even if the Devasthanam Board exists, it should be ensured that seers or priests head it and not bureaucrats. With this announcement, the CM overturned yet another decision taken by his predecessor. Soon after taking charge last month, Tirath Rawat had withdrawn all cases registered against those who had been booked for flouting norms related to Covid-19 guidelines. He had also dismissed over 100 BJP functionaries, who were given minister or minister of state rank during Trivendra Rawat’s tenure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/control-of-uttarakhand-shrines-to-go-back-from-babus-to-priests-cm-at-vhp-meet/articleshow/81997070.cms||Kautilya Singh

Kumar added that state governments in will also be asked to act tough on issues like “love jihad”. He also said that VHP office-bearers will soon start a campaign to meet governments of states from where forced religious conversions are being frequently reported. “All the seers present at the meeting were unanimous that temples should not be administered by the government. It has been decided that the government control on temples should be checked,” said Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/vhp-to-ask-state-govts-to-take-up-love-jihad-issue/articleshow/81997171.cms||Ishita Mishra

"What kind of writ petition is this? Why a person above 18 years of age cannot choose religion. Why do you think there is the word ‘propagate’ used in the Constitution? We will impose heavy cost on you," a three-judge bench of Justices R F Nariman, B R Gavai and Hrishikesh Roy told senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, who was appearing for petitioner and BJP functionary Ashwini Upadhyay. Sensing the fate of the petition, advocate Shankaranarayanan pleaded the bench to allow the petitioner to make a representation to the government and the Law Commission on the issue. But the bench refused to grant him the liberty and said, "It is a publicity interest petition and it is very harmful." "Counsel for the petitioner seeks leave of this court to withdraw the writ petition. The writ petition is dismissed as withdrawn," the bench said in its order. Upadhyay also sought directions to ascertain the feasibility of appointing a committee to enact a Conversion of Religion Act to check "abuse of religion". "Religious conversion by 'carrot and stick' and by 'hook or crook' not only offends Articles 14, 21, 25, but is also against the principles of secularism, which is an integral part of the basic structure of the Constitution. Petitioner states with dismay that the Centre and states have failed to control the menace of black magic, superstition and deceitful religious conversion, though it is their duty under Article 51A," the petition said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/why-cant-a-person-choose-religion-sc-nixes-pil-against-conversion/articleshow/81997173.cms||---

Apart from the duo, the agency also recorded the statement of DCP Raju Bhujbal and questioned Singh and API Sachin Waze again on Friday. Shinde was arrested by the National Investigation Agency in the Mansukh Hiran murder case. The CBI on Friday sought the diary and documents that were seized from the accused by NIA in their case. The bar owner, Mahesh Shetty, is likely to be a crucial witness in the case as his name was found mentioned in a diary recovered from Waze, a source said. Singh’s allegations specifically mention a Rs 100 crore per month extortion bid by Deshmukh from bars and restaurants in Mumbai. After recording Shetty’s statement, CBI officers again briefly questioned Waze on Friday evening as they wanted clarification on some information furnished by Shetty, sources said. The agency is likely to consult the NIA over the weekend and seek help in their probe, sources said. On Thursday, the CBI had questioned Mumbai police ACP Sanjay Patil who was cited as a potential witness by Singh. Singh has mentioned chats with Patil where he purportedly refers to Deshmukh’s insistence that Mumbai cops raise Rs 100 crore for him by extorting money from bars and restaurants. Within four days of registering a preliminary enquiry in connection with the Bombay HC order to probe the allegations levelled by Singh, the CBI is learnt to have questioned and recorded the statements of at least five people till Friday. The agency has questioned Singh, Waze and complainant Jayshri Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cbi-questions-ex-constable-bar-owner-in-deshmukh-case/articleshow/81997419.cms||Raj Shekhar

Union minister Babul Supriyo takes on heavyweight TMC minister Aroop Biswas in Tollygunge — the hub of Tollywood, the local film industry — making giving it the top billing in this round. Seven ministers, including heavyweights like Partha Chatterjee and Biswas, assembly speaker Biman Banerjee, Supriyo and prominent Tollywood stars (like Srabonti, Payal Sarkar, Lovely Maitra and Yash Dasgupta) are seeking election from constituencies in and around south Kolkata. Add some of the seats on the other side of the Hooghly to the mix — like Domjur (former Trinamool minister Rajib Banerjee is seeking re-election here but on a BJP ticket), Uttarpara (popular screen personality Kanchan Mallick is the Trinamool candidate), Shibpur (former India cricketer Manoj Tiwary is contesting on a Trinamool ticket) and Chinsurah (where BJP MP Locket Chatterjee is now a Vidhan Sabha candidate) — and you have a round with the largest share of VIP politicians and celebrities contesting the election. Kasba and, even more so, Jadavpur — with pockets of stable Left support base — are seats where the contest may end up three-way. And the southern suburbs of the city — places like Sonarpur — will test how much the BJP has been able to make a dent in the Trinamool’s core middle- and lower-class suburban support base. The Trinamool in 2019 led in most of these south Kolkata pockets — the two Behala seats, Tollygunge, Jadavpur, Kasba and the two Sonarpur seats — and managed to get over a 40% vote share. But the BJP too crossed the 30% mark in several of these constituencies — Kasba, Behala and the Sonarpur seats — showing how close it was behind the Trinamool. What also makes this round fascinating is the fact that every slice of the state’s electorate — both the urban (upper, middle and lower) classes and the suburban electorate, both Hindu farmers and Muslim farmers, both Bengalis and other linguistic groups (Punjabis, Gujaratis, Malayalis, Tamils, Biharis and Uttar Pradesh natives) and both upper castes and Scheduled Castes — has a significant presence in many of these constituencies. These groups bring into play all the issues that have been harped on by politicians — the “idea of Bengal”, the need for industries and jobs, the fight for agricultural land, corruption in lower-level governance and even the rights of Tollywood artistes and technicians — making this round critical for all parties. Winning Bengal without winning this round will render hollow the claim that the winner is truly representative of Bengal’s electorate, however much be its majority in the assembly. This round also has one seat with the highest female gender ratio in Bengal: Jadavpur (1,068 female voters for every 1,000 male voters). Five other seats — Behala (West), Tollygunge, Behala (East) and Sonarpur (both North and south) — too have net-positive female gender ratios, making Trinamool campaign managers hopeful of reaping the “gender dividend” of the party’s “Bangla Nijer Meyekei Chay” campaign focusing on CM Mamata Banerjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/babul-supriyo-takes-on-didi-mantri-in-kolkata-film-hub/articleshow/81997424.cms||---

---||India||Mamata gets EC notice for trying to ‘vilify’ central forces||The Election Commission Thursday issued a notice to Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee over her repeated attempts to “berate and vilify” central armed police forces by “falsely” suggesting they may intimidate electors to vote for a particular party and even inciting women voters during a recent speech to “gherao” the uniformed personnel. This is the second EC notice to Banerjee in the last couple of days. The TMC chief hit back at EC on Friday, saying she disn’t “care about your showcause letters” and would “continue speaking about CRPF until they stop working for BJP”. That prompted home minister Amit Shah to say, “The frustration of TMC over its impending defeat is evident from her (Mamata’s) action and speeches”. The EC said it was prima facie convinced that Mamata’s two statements — one during a TV interview telecast on March 28 and another in a speech on April 7 in Cooch Behar — were in violation of the model code of conduct as well as Sections 186, 189 and 504 of Indian Penal Code. The poll panel’s notice asked Banerjee to explain her stand by 11 am on Saturday. Calling Banerjee’s statements “completely false, provocative and intemperate”, the EC said her attempts to taint central paramilitary forces during the electoral process were “causing extreme demoralisation“ among the rank and file of the forces which had made “immense contribution” to conduct of free, fair and peaceful polls since the 1980s. It said her comments had the potential to drive a “wedge of distrust” between the state police and the central forces. This is the second notice to Banerjee in the last couple of days. On Wednesday, the EC had issued her a notice over her appeal for votes along communal lines, saying it violated the model code as well as Section 123 of the Representation of the People Act. The latest EC notice said the chief minister’s barbs and false accusations were running down the very forces “who have... made a commendable contribution, especially in ensuring area domination and causing deterrence for anti-social hooligans by their sheer presence, thereby playing a major role in assisting the EC to conduct free, fair, transparent and accessible elections”. “Far more discouraging is the fact that Banerjee has been trying to make an emotional pitch for women voters to go to the extent of inciting them to attack the personnel of CAPFs. It is extremely unfortunate that political battles are thus sought to be fought in this manner instead of being fought in the campaign trail,” the EC said. In the notice, the poll panel recalled that when it had visited West Bengal on February 21, a Trinamool Congress delegation had alleged that BSF personnel were intimidating villagers living in border areas to vote in favour of a particular party in the polls. The delegation, however, could not submit any evidence in this regard. “I have asked for concrete instances. They (BSF) are one of the finest forces in the country. There is no point in castigating any force, ad nauseam,” CEC Sunil Arora had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mamata-gets-ec-notice-for-trying-to-vilify-central-forces/articleshow/81997575.cms||---

Local tehsildar and incident commander G Nancharaiah said the decision was taken as people are making light of the situation. Kollipara village has been reporting between 10 to 15 cases each day for the past few days, Nancharaiah said, and six deaths have been reported in one week. All shops, except medical and milk shops, will operate only between 6 am to 10 am. Shops in Kollipara, Tumulur and Davulur cross road junction will be closed for a week, starting Saturday. “The lockdown will be enforced for a week to contain the virus spread. All commercial establishments except medical shops and milk vendors have been asked to operate only for four hours during the day,” said Nancharaiah, clarifying this was not a lockdown but restrictions on business activities. Kollipara mandal reported around 30 Covid-19 cases in the last week while Kollipara reported eight cases on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/curbs-on-biz-activities-in-village-in-guntur-dist/articleshow/81994370.cms||Samdani MN

The portion reserved for institutional investors was subscribed 3.1 times, while the retail investor portion was subscribed 0.4 times and the non-institutional (high net worth investors) category was subscribed 1.5 times. The portion reserved for employees was subscribed 0.2 times. The Rs 2,500-crore IPO of Macrotech, one of the largest residential real estate developers in the country, had opened on Wednesday at a price band of Rs 483-486 per share. A day before the IPO opened, the company had allotted about 1.5 crore shares to a clutch of foreign and domestic investors to raise Rs 740 crore. On Friday afternoon, the grey market premium (GMP) for Macrotech Developers was in the Rs 5-6 range, or 1-1.5% of the IPO price. In comparison, some of the recent IPOs had commanded GMPs in the range of 80-100%. Higher GMPs indicate a better listing gain for investors. The stock is expected to be listed in the third week of this month. At the upper end of the IPO price band, Macrotech Developers will have a market capitalisation of about Rs 21,750 crore. DLF with a market cap of Rs 69,173 crore and Godrej Properties with Rs 37,875 crore are currently valued more than the estimated valuation of Macrotech Developers. Of the total amount being raised through the IPO, Rs 1,500 crore will be used to reduce the company’s debt, Rs 375 crore for acquiring land and land developmental rights, while the rest will be kept aside for spending on general corporate purposes. This is the third time that the company has been trying to get listed after withdrawing its prospectus in 2009 and then again in 2018. The 26-year-old Macrotech Developers is a major player in the residential real estate market with its business mainly concentrated in and around the Mumbai metropolitan region. In 2019, it entered the logistics and industrial parks segment as a developer, the company said in the IPO documents. Axis Capital, JP Morgan and Kotak Investment Banking are among the 10 merchant bankers managing the offer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/lodhas-rs-2-5k-cr-ipo-subscribed-1-4x/articleshow/81995095.cms||---

The resolution moved by mayor G Hari Venkata Kumari was passed by unanimous consent of council members of all the parties. Earlier in the day, TDP and CPI(M) corporators conducted a padayatra from different parts of the city to reach the GVMC office to attend the first council meeting, which was conducted after a gap of nine years. Of the 10-item main agenda and 33-point supplementary agenda, the council passed 41 items. The two items, which have been put on hold, include the proposed utilisation of the services of 38 community guards and payment of Rs 72 lakh bills that the GVMC spent during Cyclone Titli in 2018. There was a heated exchange of words between YSRC and TDP leaders after some TDP corporators alleged a lackadaisical approach on the part of the ruling party to the privatisation of the steel plant. YSRC Anakapalle MLA G Amarnath countered the allegations and said that the YSRC would move a similar resolution on the matter in the next assembly meeting. Vizag MP MVV Satyanarayana, who attended the meeting as an ex-officio member, said that it was very unfortunate to see the Union government going ahead with the privatisation of VSP despite their continued fight on the issue. CPI(M) corporator Dr B Ganga Rao said that it would be more fitting, if all 98 corporators would protest in New Delhi during the next session of Parliament. Independent corporator Mohammed Sadiq suggested recruiting community guards from the fishermen community. A number of issues such as water scarcity in various wards, pipeline leakages, non-functioning streetlights, etc. cropped during the meeting. Several corporators opposed the state government’s decision to sell a few government land parcels in Visakhapatnam, including the 14-acre land pocket on the beach road that was earlier given to LuLu group for developing an international convention centre. Meanwhile, CPI(M) corporator Ganga Rao alleged that the GVMC function halls are under the hold of businessmen who are charging hefty fees, leaving no scope for the common man to conduct weddings or other functions in these halls. Sadiq also raised the issue of illegal hike in the charges of municipal function halls in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/gvmc-council-unanimous-in-opposing-vsp-privatisation/articleshow/81994287.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Weathermen have claimed that similar weather condition is likely to prevail till Sunday. Shailendra Kumar Patel, a meteorologist at the Patna Meteorological Centre, said thunderstorm activities occurred at some places in northeastern parts of the state in the evening. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) in its all-India weather bulletin issued on Friday evening stated that a cyclonic circulation was lying over Bihar and adjoining east Uttar Pradesh. Accordingly, the IMD issued a forecast of isolated to scattered rainfall with a thunderstorm, lightning and gusty winds (30-40kmph) likely over most parts of east and central India during the next four days. "Mixing of dry westerly and moist easterly winds near Bihar has led to thunderstorm activities across the state. Such weather condition is likely to remain till Sunday," Patel said, adding, no significant change in temperature is likely to be witnessed over the next two days. Patel, however, claimed that clear skies after a couple of days will lead to a rise in temperature along with the possibility of heatwave condition at a few places in south Bihar. As per IMD norms, the heatwave condition occurs when the normal temperature is 40-degree C and above, and the actual temperature continues to be 4.5 notches above the respective normal for two consecutive days. The maximum temperature in most cities in the state is hovering in the range of 35-39 degrees C. In Patna, the maximum temperature was 33.6 degrees C on Friday, which was higher than the corresponding normal. The met office forecast says the maximum temperature in the state capital may touch 40 degrees C by April 15. The minimum temperature here was 24.6 degrees C, which was also four notches higher than the corresponding normal. Private weather agency Skymetweather, on the other hand, also reported on Friday that Nor’wester or Kalbaisakhi struck a large area over east India on Thursday, the first of this pre-monsoon season. Many parts of West Bengal, Odisha and Jharkhand were pounded by a line squall embedded with the infamous Nor’wester, a violent thunderstorm accompanied by strong winds and severe lightning. Local heat proved trigger in the afternoon hours to build deep clouds charged along with lightning and thunder. The private weather agency stated that the Nor’wester activities are likely to prevail over the next 24 hours, though on a milder note.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/norwester-effect-isolated-thunderstorm-likely-till-tomorrow/articleshow/81994238.cms||Piyush Tripathi

The restrictions have been imposed by district judge Ramesh Chandra Dwivedi following the Patna high court’s direction to the subordinate courts to function under virtual mode till further order in view of the rapid spread of coronavirus in the state. When the lawyers tried to force their entry through the main gate, the district judge called police to turn them away. However, amid the pandemonium, the scheduled Nalanda Bar Association election went off peacefully on Friday. Over 800 lawyers exercised their franchise to select president, secretary and other office-bearers of the association. The results will be declared on Saturday. Meanwhile, protesting lawyers alleged that the district judge unnecessarily restricted their movement from the main gate and parking of their vehicles on the court premises, while several vehicles of the judges and magistrates were already parked there. Bar association secretary Dinesh Kumar said the district judge should have taken the lawyers into confidence before imposing restrictions. “We will call off protest only after the district judge apologises for his misbehaviour,” Dinesh said. While responding to the lawyers’ demand, district judge Dwivedi said, “He didn’t say anything for which he should apologise.” With regard to the restrictions and court functioning through virtual mode, the DJ said he had no say in the high court’s directive. He said the high court has directed the junior courts to not allow any unauthorised person inside the court and he was just implementing the order. He said the courts in the district would continue to function through virtual mode till the next high court’s order. The court’s usual functioning got effected by the lawyers’ boycott of work on Friday. Even the jail vehicle with undertrial prisoners had to return from the court gate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/biharsharif-lawyers-protest-restrictions/articleshow/81993899.cms||Farrukh Nadim
---||Kolkata||Son sends Mrinal awards, medals to US univ archive||Kolkata: Mrinal Sen’s son Kunal on Thursday transferred archivable materials belonging to the director to the University of Chicago library. His father, one of the globally renowned auteurs from Bengal, didn’t believe in archives, though. Among the belongings are film awards and medallions like Golden Bear — the highest prize awarded for the best film at the Berlin International Film Festival — which Mrinal Sen had received in 1981 for ‘Akaler Sandhane’. “Either because of his deep distrust for nostalgia, or it was simple laziness, he did not take care of any documents. During his life, he threw away all letters, all his screenplays and manuscripts. So what I could finally gather was very little — some correspondence between us, a bunch of photographs, and some of his awards,” the iconic film-maker’s son, who lives in Chicago, wrote on his Facebook wall. But people would always be interested in the man who made films like ‘Bhuvan Shome’ in 1969 and many others, until he left for eternity on December 30, 2018. His son, who has been the chief technology development officer of the 253-year-old Encyclopedia Britannica, decided to donate his father’s belongings to the 1890-found University of Chicago (UC) which had the right archiving infrastructure. Many of Sen’s admirers had asked Kunal whether the archive should have been set up in their Padmapukur home, where Sen and his late actor wife Gita had lived.“An archive in our Kolkata house would have these things gathering dust and cobwebs,” Kunal would reply. Kunal was more than happy when UC approached with the desire to preserve these documents for posterity. “I have seen their special archives, and I know of their long heritage, and I feel confident that they are capable to preserving them for a very long time.” The collection will be accessible digitally.

From now onward, the roll numbers will also indicate the year of the examination. Under thee new pattern, the roll number allotted to the students is of nine digits in place of earlier seven digits. Of this, the first two numbers would reveal the year of examination in which a student is appearing in the Board exam, while the remaining seven digits would be the roll number like previous years. “This year, we have introduced this important change following which it would be easy for not only our office but also for the parents and students as to in which year they had appeared in their class X or XII board exam as the first two numbers correspond to their year of appearing in the exam,” said secretary, UP Board, Divyakant Shukla. This year a total of 56,03,813 students have registered to appear in class X and class XII exams of UP Board. Of these, 29,94,312 are of class X and the rest 26,09,501 students are of class XII. The exams, which were to start from April 24, have recently been postponed by the board authorities. Now both high school and intermediate exams would commence from May 8. The class X exams would conclude on May 25 while that of class XII would end on May 28. Board sources said the change would be of much use for the clerical staff of the Board who deal with the documents of the students, be it issuing duplicate marksheets or other documents or segregating the same on the basis of roll numbers of the students. “Now onward, whenever we would have to look for the document of the student concerned, we will just refer to the roll number and the same would inform us the year of his or her appearing in the exam and save time,” said a senior staff member of the Board looking after marksheet section. This year is also the 100th year of the establishment of this one of the largest education boards of the world with over 56 lakhs students registered for appearing in class X and XII board exams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/from-this-year-up-board-roll-numbers-to-indicate-year-of-exam/articleshow/81994503.cms||---

The vaccination would be done at all urban and rural centres during this period. Yogi, who was in the city on Friday, held a meeting at the central conference hall of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) to review the situation and available medical arrangements in the district. He also inspected the Kashi Integrated Command and Control Centre (KICCC). The CM asked the officials to ensure the availability of sufficient stock of the vaccine. He said that arrangements for Covid dedicated ambulances should be made. Currently, there are 18 such ambulances in Varanasi. The CM directed to increase the number of such ambulances to 25. He further said that there was a need of quick expansion of medical facilities, as the intensity of the second wave of coronavirus infection is greater. He suggested controlled OPDs with limited patients, and starting tele-consultancy for patients. The private hospitals, which were turned into Covid hospitals, should be activated again. Besides, the rates of RT-PCR test, antigen tests, and Covid treatment at private hospitals should be determined to check the exploitation of patients. He also warned that strict actions like black-listing and sealing would be taken in case of fake pathological reports. The CM said that the health workers, corona warriors, police and administrative officials should take care, and increase the contact tracing. The infected people should stay in home isolation or get admitted to a hospital. There are over 1,000 beds in L-3 and L-2 hospitals in the district, he said adding that the number of beds should be increased, as people from eastern UP and Bihar also come to Varanasi for treatment. Yogi said that as the situation in Maharashtra and Punjab is not good, special trains will be run for the people who are returning home. The facility of antigen tests at railway stations and bus stands should be restored. He directed the officials to form supervision committees at gram panchayat and ward basis and provide them thermometer, sanitizer and oximeter. There should be a watch on the people coming from outside, and they should be tested, he added. The CM laid stress on the awareness drive against Covid-19 using the public address system. Action would be taken against the violators of Covid protocol. He said that the people of civil defence, NCC, home guards and PRD jawans should be roped in. The sanitation and sanitization drive should be conducted on war footing. Divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal, through a powerpoint presentation, apprised the CM of the current situation in the district. He said that 1,51,126 samples were tested from March to April 8 out of which 4,911 tested positive for Covid-19. So far, 1,031 patients have been declared cured. Currently, 203 patients are in hospital and 3,677 are in home isolation, he said adding that there are 1,058 beds including 223 ICU beds in the hospitals. There is a facility of 8,330 testing every day in the hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/cm-4-day-covid-vaccination-drivewill-be-held-in-state-from-april-11/articleshow/81994305.cms||---

The building, which is coming up in front of the medical unit where “abandoned quarters” were located, is being constructed with funds granted under Rashtriya Ucchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) and executed by the state government. “The new building is being constructed for the purpose of a Students Activity Centre and an Academic Facility Centre. This will require an area not exceeding the same of the abandoned staff quarters, not a few square feet extra will be required. This will be only vertically space addition for the benefit of students without taking any space from Prangan. This was needed by the students’ body in current and previous times. This is a project executed by the state government and funded under RUSA,” said Arun Kumar Maiti, dean of students’ affairs in Presidency University. He said some of the construction material might have been kept where open activity area is, but it will be removed as soon as the construction is complete. “It will be removed because we do not want to take up space meant for the students,” said Maity. Members of the students’ council said that common rooms, auditoriums, activity centres, indoor sporting area and academic centres were for the benefit of the students, but the open space referred to as Prangan was not in the ambit of the area earmarked for construction. “We are not against the construction of the building that will house amenities and facilities for the students because we have been elected by the students to work for their development and welfare. The university will have to utilize whatever space is available on the campus. But Prangan is a space generations of students are emotionally attached to. The place can be utilised to keep construction material for the time being, but once on-campus classes resume, we will want our space back,” said Mimosa Ghorai, president of the Presidency University Students’ Union. The university authorities said the construction is being done “without taking any space from Prangan”. The building is coming up on the area where abandoned quarters were located, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/academic-centre-games-arena-presidency-goes-for-infra-upgrade/articleshow/81994871.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Altogether 17 passengers coming out of train number 03202 (Kurla-Patna Express), which arrived at Patna Junction at 1am on Friday, tested positive for Covid-19. They have been isolated at Hotel Patliputra Ashok Covid care centre. Trivedi sought cooperation from passengers and people to help railways fight Covid-19. According to Trivedi, railways has put on alert all its health and security staff at major stations under the ECR jurisdiction. At least 17 special passenger trains are either originating from or reaching different places in Bihar from Mumbai and Pune every day. These trains have been brought under strict surveillance on their arrival in Bihar, he said, adding railway health and security personnel are conducting a thorough health check-up of each passenger with the cooperation from the state health department. “Railways has made full arrangements for the Covid test on the platforms. Any passenger found positive is being detained and sent to the isolation centres by the state health department officials concerned,” he said, adding railways has decided to vaccinate its staff on station duty. Though railways is running 180 pairs of special passenger trains either originating from or passing through Bihar, it has decided to run at least 28 more special trains to bring stranded people back home from different places, he said, adding about 90% railway health workers have been vaccinated so far while running staff like loco pilots, guards, ticket checking staff, station masters and other essential services employees were being vaccinated on priority. Danapur DRM Sunil Kumar all possible arrangements have been made for safe arrival or boarding of passengers at Patna Junction or Rajendra Nagar Terminal. Railways has deployed adequate number of health staff at these two main stations of the division to carry out thermal screening and other required test on the platforms, he said, adding passengers must reach station premises at least two hours before the departure of trains so that railways can carry out their health check-up and luggage scanning on time. According to ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, railways has also arranged medical treatment for sick passengers on running trains. In fact, railways has provided this facility at all major stations under ECR, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/railways-to-run-28-more-trains-to-bring-stranded-people-home/articleshow/81993820.cms||Kumod Verma

---||Patna||Covid spread in Bihar: Villagers gear up to deal with returnee migrants||PATNA: With reports of migrant workers heading home from other states due to the renewed resurgence of Covid19 cases, residents in rural areas have started chalking out strategies to check the spread of the deadly virus. Despite their busy schedule as panchayat polls are due to be held in the state, mukhiyas and other panchayat representatives have decided to persuade family members of the returning migrants to ask them to remain in isolation for two weeks. "We are alert and keeping a close surveillance on returning migrants to the villages from their workplace due to the fear of lockdown as Covid19 cases have suddenly surged," said Poonam Devi, mukhiya of Chakanwa panchayat in Rohtas district. Poonam had distributed ration, clothes and other household items among migrant workers after they returned during the nation-wide lockdown last year. Prince Singh, the mukhiya of Raspur Patasia panchayat in Samastipur district, said, "So far no positive cases of Covid19 among migrant workers have come to our notice. But we are maintaining a strict vigil on them." However, a panchayat head in Supaul said on the condition of anonymity that a spat took place between the family members of some migrant workers and panchayat functionaries when the latter asked the migrants to stay in an isolation centre as a precautionary measure. Several residents of the Araria district said that they have already issued instructions to the family members of migrant workers to take precautions to check the virus spread. "The lapses on their part will cost all residents of the village dearly," Mohan Kumar Sudhanshu, a panchayat functionary said. In some villages in Aurangabad district, the residents have earmarked school buildings, panchayat bhawans and places of worship for the stay of the returnee migrants. "We have taken a lesson from the past. The same mistakes won't be repeated," said Vimal Kumar Jitendra, a four-term mukhiya in the Samastipur district. Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Thursday announced to set up quarantine centres at the block level in the wake of the surging cases of Covid19 in the state. The CM also said even those who tested negative for coronavirus would have to stay in isolation centres as a precautionary measure. Last year, the migrant workers had to walk hundreds of kilometres with children and other family members without food and water to reach home due to the lockdown. Several of them even lost their lives on their way to their home. This time, the migrant workers are travelling in buses, trucks and trains to reach their native place in advance to avoid the trauma and agony they have to face due to lockdown in 2020. They are scared of being stuck in big cities and remaining without ant work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-spread-villagers-gear-up-to-deal-with-returnee-migrants/articleshow/81993777.cms||Ramashankar

In an attempt to protect fisheries and biodiversity during the marine breeding season, the government enforces the ban every summer, restricting fishing activities by mechanised and motorised vessels fitted with inboard or outboard engines, excluding non-motorised crafts, as per the AP Marine Fishing Regulation Act, 1994. Ch Satyanarayana Murthy, president, Dolphin Boat Operators’ Welfare Association, said there are over 2,000 mechanised boats in Andhra Pradesh. But even before the ban, the majority of mechanised fishing boats were anchored at harbours following losses due to low catch of popular fish, he added. Meanwhile, the long-pending demand of fishermen to increase financial assistance during the 61-day fishing ban has been fulfilled with the state government enhancing financial support for fishermen from Rs 4,000 to Rs 10,000.

Advocate general S Sriram, representing the discoms, told the court that they have already filed an affidavit on April 1 with details of payments and arrears. There has been further progress in payments after filing the affidavit, he said, and sought time to file an additional affidavit. Wind and solar power generating companies having PPAs with discoms had moved appeal petitions in the high court challenging the single judge order allowing the Electricity Regulatory Commission (ERC) to review power tariffs in the PPAs made by the previous government. The court had earlier directed the discoms to clear the arrears based on agreed tariff to both parties which, it said, would be adjusted subject to the outcome of the appeal petitions. Senior counsels, appearing for the power companies, raised objections to the affidavit filed by the discoms and stated that the details of payments in the affidavit are not matching with the actual payments. As the advocate general asked time for filing an additional affidavit, the bench headed by Chief Justice A K Goswami suggested to wait till it is filed and posted the matter for further hearing to April 22. The advocate general told the HC they have filed an affidavit with details of payments and arrears.

---||Dehradun||Forest fires turn Uttarakhand’s air lethal||NAINITAL: For days now the forests of Uttarakhand have been on fire, turning the air over the pristine hill state lethal. Levels of black carbon, or soot, have shot up six times while that of ozone has trebled — both going straight from safe levels to dangerously toxic ones within perhaps a week. By Friday, black carbon levels had gone from about 1,000-2,000 microgram per cubic metre last month, before the fires started, to 10,000-12,000 microgram per cubic metre of air. The concentration of ozone, which used to be around 40-45 parts per billion then, has risen to 110-115 parts per billion now. The safe threshold for black carbon in the air is 3,000-4,000 microgram per cubic metre, while that of ozone is 40-50 parts per billion with an hourly range of 80 and an eight-hour average range of 60. High black carbon and ozone in the air can cause complications from chest pain to coughing, irritation and, on prolonged exposure, damage the heart and lungs. “Black carbon is released during incomplete combustion of fuels (like wood from the forests). Ozone is produced when poisonous gases like carbon monoxide react with sunlight,” Prof Manish Naja, head of the atmospheric science division at the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) at Nainital, which observed the dangerous spike, told TOI. “The unusually high concentration of these gases means the air is getting more polluted and the major reason is the forest fire … It’s almost like the pollution levels of Delhi.” While forest fires always blaze through Uttarakhand around this time of the year, the scale of destruction this time around has been much larger. Dry conditions because of little post-monsoon rain and no snowfall this winter (Nainital had snowfall six times in the winter of 2019-20) have fed the inferno. “The pollution levels themselves indicate how bad the fires have been,” Naja said. And even these numbers are conservative estimates. “The ARIES campus, where the data were recorded, is a few kilometres away from Nainital. The pollution levels in the town and other areas closer to the fire would be much higher,” Naja said. “We will conduct a more detailed study to document the effect of forest fires and pollution they cause. We will study the data collected over the state as well as satellite images to create a model. That will, we hope, show the impact these fires have had on the atmosphere and ecology.” Rishikesh pollution monitoring systems to be revamped: ARIES has signed an MoU with the state pollution control board to overhaul the pollution monitoring systems in the two cities of Dehradun and Rishikesh. Prof Umesh Chandra Dumka, a scientist at the institute, said, “The aim is to reduce pollution levels in both cities by up to 30% by 2024. It is part of the National Clean Air Programme. We will be providing technical support and, if things go as planned, we will also develop models to predict pollution levels in these cities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-forest-fires-push-black-carbon-levels-up-6-times-ozone-3-times-over-hill-state/articleshow/81993983.cms||Prashant Jha

Cops suspect the smuggler may have been shot at by a rival gang. The liquor smuggler has been identified as 35-year-old Nunu Rai, a native Anyaypur village under Katra police station of Muzaffarpur. Katra SHO Lalit Kumar said Nunu was evading arrest in more than half of a dozen liquor smuggling cases. “Besides these large numbers of cases with Katra police station, he is also accused in several cases of liquor smuggling with neighbouring police stations too. He was continuously evading arrest,” he said. SHO Kumar said that police received a few photos of a person under treatment for bullet injuries via media persons on Friday morning. “We sprang into action as soon as the injured was identified as Nunu who was evading arrest in several liquor smuggling cases,” he said, adding, a police team rushed to the private hospital and placed him under arrest immediately. “Force has been deployed at the hospital to keep an eye on him. He is in an unconscious condition,” the SHO said. “He has been shot at least thrice including in the chest. His condition is critical. An unidentified person brought him to the hospital around 2 am on Friday,” he added. The SHO further said that Nunu was admitted to the hospital under the fake name and address of Arjun Rai of Jajuar village under the Katra police station area. He said Nunu’s father Mahavir Rai and his younger brother Praveen Rai were sent to jail a fortnight back after getting arrested in a liquor smuggling case by Katra police. “There is no one at his home whom the police could question regarding what happened to him. We have no other option but to wait until Nunu gains consciousness to give a statement,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/notorious-liquor-smuggler-found-with-bullet-wounds-at-muz-hosp/articleshow/81993911.cms||---

This indicates a revival of the tug of war between traders, who want higher yields, and the central bank which wants the opposite. Similar actions were seen during the last four months of the previous financial year. On the positive side for the government bond market, the benchmark yield on the 10-year gilts closed marginally softer at slightly below the 6.02% level. In Friday’s G-sec auction, Rs 10,926 crore worth of bonds maturing in 2026 remained unsold (also called devolvement), RBI data showed. Through this auction, the government was set to borrow Rs 32,000 crore in total, spread over bonds of four different tenures. However, the lower borrowing because of the unsold bonds of five-year tenure was partially offset through higher borrowings of Rs 5,927 crore through three other bonds. According to bond market players, the RBI’s commitment in its policy announcement on Wednesday in which it assured to contain any abrupt spike in yield for the longer term paper eased pressure on the medium to long end of the yield curve. However, the shorter end (tenure of up to seven years) of the curve is expected to go up slowly with the use of longer term variable reverse repo for liquidity absorption, they said. In its bimonthly policy meet that ended on Wednesday, the RBI had said that liquidity operations will continue to ensure orderly market conditions. As part of the same, the RBI will hold variable rate reverse repos of longer maturities. Also, to ensure orderly evolution of the yield curve, it was decided to buy G-secs from the secondary market G-sec Acquisition Programme (GSAP).

The corporation’s chairman M R Kumar revealed on Friday that business growth for the year FY21 was 10%. Figures released by the insurance regulator reveal that for the 11 months ended February 2021, LIC had recorded a new business premium of Rs 1,56,068 crore, which was 3% lower than the previous year. This was despite the premium for February 2021, at Rs 10,404 crore, being 27% higher than the previous year. The premium for the life industry until February 2021 was Rs 2,34,861 crore — a 0.6% increase. LIC’s share of the industry until February was around 69%. Kumar was speaking at the launch of former Irdai member Nilesh Sathe’s autobiography ‘Never Give Up’, published by Popular Prakashan. Sathe, who rose through the ranks in LIC, went on to take senior responsibilities in the corporation and the insurance regulator after being operated on thrice for cancer and numerous chemotherapy sessions. Pointing out that all LICians have the never-give-up attitude, Kumar said that despite going through their own trials and tribulations the corporation managed to settle a record number of claims and achieve growth this year. This was an achievement that appeared very unlikely because of the initial lockdown and the fact that most of LIC’s sales are agent-driven. Sathe is now a financial adviser to the National Highways Authority of India. Speaking at the event, Sathe said that the authority, despite challenges, managed to raise Rs 65,000 crore during the year, which almost matches the target.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/lic-manages-to-grow-biz-10-in-fy21-amid-covid/articleshow/81995117.cms||---

Apart from the death of 16 people, at least 10 others had fallen ill after consuming poisonous hooch on the day of Holi. Police have also not been able to identify the person who had supplied raw spirit to make the poisonous liquor. While Pappu Yadav, Suraj alias Karpu Choudhary, Minta Devi and her son Anil Choudhary were arrested on April 5 for their alleged involvement in the hooch deaths, the key accused in the case, Arvind Yadav, was arrested from Kolkata the next day. Police said it was Arvind who had manufactured the poisonous hooch at Kharidi Bigha village. The 16 victims were from Kharidi Bigha, Gondapur, Siswan, Budhaul, Kanhai Nagar and New Area, all under the Town police station area of Nawada. The then SHO of Town police station T N Tiwari, Budhaul chowkidar Vikash Kumar Mishra and excise department sub-inspector Nagendra Prasad were suspended for the incident. Nawada SP Dhurat Saayli Savlaram said other accused had fled after Arvind’s arrest from Kolkata. She, however, added the rest of the accused would be arrested soon. Nawada sadar SDPO Upendra Prasad said at least 10 more people are yet to be arrested in connection with the hooch deaths. “All of them are from neighbouring areas of Nawada town. It is yet not clear who had supplied the raw materials to Arvind. Police are awaiting test reports to know if methyl alcohol was used in making hooch,” he said. Meanwhile, SHO (incharge) of Town police station Narottam Kumar said Arvind was also evading arrest in a liquor smuggling case registered in July last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nawaha-hooch-deaths-10-accused-still-at-large/articleshow/81993935.cms||---

Already hit hard for almost the whole of last year due to the closure of Lord Venkateswara temple for three months, they fear another lockdown will push them to the brink. The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams has already suspended the issuance of free darshan tokens to devotees under current booking quota in Tirupati from April 12, which will reduce daily pilgrim footfall to Tirumala to around 30,000, a sharp decline from the daily average of around 55,000 in February and March. After the temple reopened for pilgrim worship in June last year, businesses took time to pick up and were just back on their feet. Traders were hoping for a good summer ahead following the announcement of the TTD in March to resume arjitha sevas from April 14. But the spike in Covid-19 cases in the last few days has led to the slow return of the curbs in Tirumala, directly affecting pilgrim footfall which in turn has begun to adversely affect the livelihood of thousands of small-time traders in the hill town. Sridhar Roy, who runs a small hotel in Tirumala, said the future looks bleak for people like him. “The streets of Tirumala, which had started looking busy, are looking deserted once again. For small traders like us the future looks bleak,” he rued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/future-uncertain-for-tirumala-traders-as-covid-curbs-return/articleshow/81994267.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

Panchayati raj department minister Smrat Choudhary said the DMs, DPROs and the BDOs have been asked to issue notices to the mukhiyas and other panchayat functionaries against whom complaints of irregularities in the ambitious scheme to supply tap water in rural areas were received. He said the panchayati raj department would initiate disciplinary action against them if they failed to comply with the directive of the district authorities within a timeframe. The department has directed the officials concerned to lodge FIRs against the erring panchayat functionaries. A source in the panchayati raj department said if the mukhiyas, their deputies and ward members were removed from their posts on corruption charges, they would not be able to contest the panchayat elections for five years. The nominations of such people will be declared null and void as per the prescribed rules. The mukhiyas and the other representatives have been asked to reply to the notices within 15 days. Meanwhile, all the 8,386 mukhiyas have been asked to submit utilisation certificates within the stipulated period failing which action would be initiated against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tap-water-scheme-anomalies-1475-mukhiyas-to-face-action/articleshow/81993895.cms||Ramashankar
---||Kolkata||80% buses with EC, Kolkata hits sky-high app-cab fare hurdle||Kolkata: The app-cab fare shot through the roof on Friday with demand far exceeding supply. The crisis was the result of the severe crunch due to requisition of 80% buses by the Election Commission to ferry central armed forces and polling officials. For the last few days, commuters have been facing a surge in app-cabs fares. But on Friday, the surge fare skyrocketed. “I was trying to book a cab from Behala Chowrasta to Bhowanipore, which was showing Rs 535 as the fare. I decided to lodge a complaint with the aggregator,” said Amit Adhikari, a banker. For many, there was ‘no cab in the vicinity’ in the morning. “I waited nearly an hour and then tried to book a bike-cab. But that, too, came late and the fare was unusually high,” said Gautam Baskak, a trader. “The bike-taxi fare generally does not exceed Rs 60 for a trip from Chetla to Kidderpore, but today it was Rs 120,” he said. Metered taxis exploited the situation. “None was ready to go on meter, even after a promise of adding Rs 30-Rs 40 extra. The drivers were asking for arbitrary amounts, like Rs 500-Rs 600 for a New Alipore-Howrah station trip, which seldom exceeds Rs 170 on meter,” said Raj Krishnan, who had to catch an early train to Tatanagar. “The demand was exceptionally high compared to the supply. The surge fare was supposed to attract more cabbies to come on board, but it failed as the aggregators were not sharing the benefit of surge fare with them. Thus the demand-supply gap remained yawning as the day progressed,” said Indranil Banerjee, secretary, Online Cab Operators’ Guild. “There was no foothold on the few overcrowded buses that were available and the queues for autos were long. People waited for hours. Even auto fares saw a slight jump. Auto operators truncated their routes during the return journey. The faster this election passes, the better it is for us,” said Tamal Dasgupta, a private insurance company executive who reached his Park Circus office from Garia an hour late. The situation is likely to swing back to normal only after Tuesday, since the EC is unlikely to release most of the buses before that. Cops have requisitioned many buses which are being used for law-and-order forces. If tension prevails, the buses will be kept on stand by,” said Tapan Banerjee, secretary, Joint Council of Bus Syndicates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/80-buses-with-ec-kolkata-hits-sky-high-app-cab-fare-hurdle/articleshow/81994852.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Many pilots have been detected Covid positive in the line of duty, while some have lost their lives or loved ones to the disease. Yet, the majority of our colleagues continue to unconditionally face danger every day in the biohazard frontline,” said FIP president Surinder Mehta. In Kolkata, there are around 400 pilots engaged in Air India, IndiGo, Vistara, SpiceJet, GoAir and regional air taxi firms. “It has come as a huge disappointment to the aviation community that while many categories of transport-related workers, like Indian Railways employees and police personnel at airports/railway stations, have been categorized as frontline workers and prioritized for the vaccine, commercial pilots have been left out. We feel such an exclusion, compounded with the lack of mandatory testing, exposes a huge gap in our national effort to combat the disease,” said Mehta. While pilots above 45 can get the vaccine now, those under 45 are unable to do so even if they have a co-morbidity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pilots-body-demands-place-on-vax-list/articleshow/81994861.cms||---
---||Business||Hidesign restructures its export strategy||Puducherry-headquartered leather brand Hidesign is restructuring its export plans to focus more on e-commerce through the Amazon Global Selling platform particularly in developed markets. The decision to use the Amazon platform in markets like the UK, US, Germany and Australia among others was taken following the twin squeeze of high overheads in global markets and sales disruption due to the pandemic. “Our exports took a hit particularly during the pandemic so we’ve reworked our strategies to go direct to customers instead of investing in stores overseas which is a costly proposition. We’re partnering with Amazon and their team in Bengaluru is advising us on and supporting the brand in taxation, logistics, inventory and marketing. E-commerce is the best way to acquire a global footprint because it is less risky,” said Dilip Kapur, founder of Hidesign.The switch to the Amazon platform will compliment Hidesign’s brick-and-mortar strategy for neighbourhood export markets. Hidesign is sticking to the store-led approach in markets like Sri Lanka where it has a ‘three-store tie up’ and in Nepal where it has a ‘similar arrangement,’ said Kapur. The company has a tieup with Noon for e-commerce presence in Middle East and Egypt.The ‘less risky’ strategy has come on the back of the pandemic hit that the brand has taken. “International sales have collapsed and it is now 15% of last year whereas domestic has recovered to 70%,” said Kapur. With profitability taking a hit, the brand is also cutting back it's presence in airport retail which suffered as air travel was down drastically due to the pandemic. “We closed 20 stores, many in airports, and have opened 6 new ones and we've tied up with FabIndia to have a more comprehensive high street presence,” he said.Hidesign is one of a growing list of marquee consumer brands like Dabur, Hidesign, Titan, Amul, Dettol, Himalaya, FabIndia, Haldiram and others that are using Amazon's global selling program to tap global markets. Indeed the number of exporters on the platform have gone up from 60,000 in March 2020 to 70,000 now. “Big Indian brands in the beauty, nutrition, wellness, health and personal care, cotton and leather products, watches and food items are doing very well. Through our global selling programme, these brands are tapping not just the diaspora customers with whom they enjoy some recall but also native customers who may not know the brand at all but are buying into specific products,” said Abhijit Kamra, head of Amazon Gobal Selling.Hidesign's export rethink is a departure from just 6 years ago when exports comprised 25-30% of production and the brand was aggressively building its global presence.The thinking then was to be in direct touch with the consumer in all markets rather than go through distributors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hidesign-restructures-its-export-strategy/articleshow/81994634.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

District magistrate Alok Tiwari at a meeting with the management of five private hospitals of the city directed them to make available Covid facilities to the people as they had provided earlier as Covid cases have again spiked in the city. “To treat patients, private hospitals have to provide Covid facilities to the people and that too without doing any overbilling. The management of the private hospitals will ensure that the facilities should be of the standard fixed by the government,” the DM said. He directed them to display fees for the treatment and update the portal regularly. “Ensure 24-hour availability of specialist doctors in the hospitals and the CTV footage of ICUs must be visual,” the DM said and added the family members of patients must be informed about their condition. The management of the hospitals informed the DM that as many as 25 beds have been reserved for Covid patients in 7 Air Force Hospital, around 75 beds in Regency Hospital, 77 beds in SPM Hospital, 60 beds in GTV hospital and 70 beds in SIS Hospital. Around 307 additional beds would be arranged in the five hospitals, they said. Chief development officer Mahendra, CMO Dr Anil Kumar Mishra, ADM (City) and representatives of the private hospitals were present in the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/admin-ask-pvt-hosps-to-provide-covid-facilities-to-people/articleshow/81994460.cms||---
---||Business||India Inc’s tech spends to grow by 7.3% in 2021||CHENNAI: With the pandemic accelerating digitisation, Information Technology (IT) spending in India is expected to rebound and reach a total of $93 billion in 2021 — an increase of 7.3% from 2020 as per global research firm Gartner. This is not just an upward revision from the 6% growth predicted by Gartner in November 2020, but also a strong bounce back from 7% decline in the country’s tech spends during the pandemic year 2020. With this projection, IT spends by Indian organisations also reach closest to the pre-Covid levels during 2019 when India’s IT spends stood at $92 billion. The IT spending in the country is expected to further grow to $98.5 billion in 2022, as per Gartner’s projections. The pandemic was an inflection point not only for organizations but also for government agencies to relook at IT as digital spending is flowing from a variety of sectors such as education, BFSI, and others including government, analysts said. As per Gartner, enterprise software spend is expected to register maximum growth for India at 13.3%, higher than the global average growth rate of 10.8%. IT services and tech device spends are set to grow at 8.9% and 7.7% respectively to reach $16 billion and $34 billion respectively. Within software, cloud technology is expected to drive majority growth in India during 2021. “The Indian economy is observing a slow but steady growth trajectory this year. Additionally, the government relaxation of foreign investment in certain sectors such as insurance, infrastructure, telecommunications will provide additional funds for business and IT leaders to accelerate their digital transformation journey,” Naveen Mishra, senior research director at Gartner, said. However, given the worldwide surge in digital technologies, growth in India’s IT spends is expected to be slower than global growth rates as worldwide IT spending in 2021 is projected to rise 8.4% from 2020 to clock around $4.1 trillion. “IT no longer just supports corporate operations as it traditionally has, but is fully participating in business value delivery,” John-David Lovelock, research vice president at Gartner, said. “Not only does this shift IT from a back-office role to the front of business, but it also changes the source of funding from an overhead expense that is maintained, monitored and sometimes cut, to the thing that drives revenue,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-incs-tech-spends-to-grow-by-7-3-in-2021/articleshow/81994709.cms||---

Earlier, a division bench of the high court had directed the State Election Commission (SEC) to conduct elections but to not declare the results pending disposal of the petitions. Elections to Eluru Municipal Corporation were stayed by the Andhra Pradesh high court single judge after a petition was moved challenging the holding of elections without correcting mistakes in electoral rolls. The single judge order was challenged before a division bench that passed an interim order to conduct elections but to not declare the result. Arguing on behalf of the state government, advocate general S Sriram told the high court that mistakes in electoral rolls were rectified and the final list was published on February 3. Adequate time was given for raising grievances over the final list. Corrections were made to the list before the election notification was issued based on the objections raised and corrections sought by voters. The entire process was undertaken according to norms. Now, with the election over and only counting of votes and announcement of result pending, he sought the high court’s directions to complete the election process. As the arguments by the respondent advocates are yet to be advanced, the high court posted the matter for further hearing to April 19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-seeks-hc-directive-to-complete-polls-in-eluru/articleshow/81994299.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Business||Irdai tweaks AIF rules for insurance companies||CHENNAI: Insurance companies have been allowed by their regulator to invest in ‘fund of funds’ provided such funds are not utilized by an Alternate Investment Fund to invest outside India. The new dispensation gives insurers a source to diversify their investment into new avenues like startups and also gives asset managers a new source of capital. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) has also barred investment into AIFs which undertake leverage or borrowing other than to meet day-to-day operational requirements and as permitted under SEBI regulations. Insurers can invest only into those Fund of Funds (FoF) that comply with the requirement of Section 278 of the Insurance Act, 1938. The insurer cannot invest in an AIF, which in turn has exposure to an FoF, in which the insurer has taken an exposure. Insurers have to disclose these investments every quarter. These new guidelines are triggered under category 2 AIF of SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012. AIFs which do not fall in Category I and III and which do not undertake leverage or borrowing other than to meet day-to-day operational requirements and as permitted in the SEBI norms. Real estate funds, private equity funds (PE funds), funds for distressed assets, etc. are the various types of funds registered as Category II AIFs. On the other hand, the Indian fund managers laud this move as it allows the creation of a strong fund of funds ecosystem in the country. It will allow them to raise money from India fund of funds and Indian institutional capital than foreign capital. And help accelerate the quantum of rupee capital going into Indian startups. This is a huge win for insurance companies as they can use this route to indirectly invests in startups, says Siddharth Pai, founding partner and CFO at 3one4 Capital and co-chair at regulatory affairs committee, Indian Venture Capital Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/irdai-tweaks-aif-rules-for-insurance-cos/articleshow/81994662.cms||Mamtha Asokan

After holding a meeting with officials, he issued instructions to get people living in containment and micro-containment zones tested for Covid-19. Officials claimed that in view of the growing number of Covid cases, the 100-metre radius of the area from where three or more positive cases are detected, are being declared micro-containment zone and sealed. However, prior to sealing the area, time is being given to the people to arrange essential goods for livelihood. During the last 20 days, more than 650 people have tested positive for Covid-19 infection in Gaya district. On Friday, 191 positive cases were reported from the district. The DM said SDOs, BDOs and mukhiyas have been directed to ensure that there is no gathering beyond the prescribed limit at the wedding functions. Regarding vaccination, the DM said there was 100% first dose vaccination of healthcare and the frontline workers. “The target is to vaccinate 4.95 lakh people above 45 years of age. However, only 24% of them have taken their first dose so far,” Singh said, with an appeal to the people to get vaccine shots at the earliest. Meanwhile, advocates owing allegiance to Gaya Bar Association registered their protest against the order for virtual court hearing. They blocked the road near civil court and raised slogans. Later, the blockade was lifted following the intervention of Civil Lines police station SHO Zafar Imam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/169-micro-containment-zones-created-in-gaya/articleshow/81993916.cms||---

The subordinate courts had resumed physical hearing after the lockdown in a restricted manner last year. Directions have been issued to restrict the entry of litigants and lawyers on court premises during the period of virtual hearing of the cases. The Patna high court has already instructed the subordinate courts to switch to virtual hearing. At least eight ADJ-rank judicial officers have been tested Covid-19 positive across the state in this second wave of infection. They include two posted at the Patna civil court, one in Kishanganj and around five in Motihari. Some other judicial officers of lower ranks have also been tested Covid-19 positive. Patna civil court public prosecutor (in-charge) Vijay Sinha said besides the two ADJs, a sub-judge of Patna has also been tested positive. “A notice has been issued on Friday evening for switching of the courts’ functioning across Patna to virtual mode from Monday. Lawyers have been instructed to carry out work from home. Jail authorities have been directed not to physically produce any accused in the courts,” Sinha said. Meanwhile, at least 35 employees in different sections of the Patna high court have been detected positive in the last few days. All those sections were closed for a day or two for extensive sanitisation work. The high court has already switched to virtual mode of hearing since April 6 and it will continue till April 17. Meanwhile, Chief Justice Sanjay Karol is still undergoing treatment at AIIMS-Patna. When asked, AIIMS-Patna medical superintendent Dr CM Singh on Friday said Chief Justice Karol was doing well. “He is completely normal but under continuous observation in an isolation room.

The order was issued for the purpose of employment in state government jobs in Tamil Nadu.The equivalent certificate was issued to 10 courses offered in Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Puducherry and even Madhya Pradesh. For instance, diploma in physical education (DPEd) offered by Karnataka State University has been deemed equivalent to DPEd offered in colleges in Tamil Nadu.BA BEd. (4-year integrated programme) awarded by Barkatullah University, Bhopal was deemed equivalent to BEd offered in Tamil Nadu. Further, the BEd (English) awarded by The English and Foreign Language University, Hyderabad, University of Calicut and University of Kerala are deemed equivalent to BEd degree offered by Tamil Nadu Teachers Education University.MA Political Science and Public Administration offered by Sri Venkateswara University, Tirupati was deemed equivalent to MA Political Science for the purpose of employment in public services. Tamil Nadu State Council for Higher Education (TANSCHE) is empowered to conduct meetings of subject experts to decide on giving equivalence certificate to similar courses offered in Tamil Nadu by comparing the curriculum of the courses.Mere equivalence certificate however may not ensure a job to a candidate applying for public service in Tamil Nadu, said senior officials from TANSCHE adding that many candidates who belong to Tamil Nadu and have pursued their higher education in other states seek equivalence to apply for government jobs in Tamil Nadu.Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) was conducting equivalence committee meeting a few years ago to check equivalence of degrees of candidates for the purpose of employment. Now the TANSCHE has been entrusted with the job.Saying that it is a routine procedure, higher education secretary S Apoorva said that equivalence of courses is given on the basis of individual requests from candidates.The equivalence certificate is given only to those who are eligible for a job and have doubts whether the course they had studied in other states will be accepted by TNPSC for a particular job, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/10-courses-of-other-states-get-tn-equivalence-certificate/articleshow/81996490.cms||Sampath Kumar

Recognising their nearly two decades of service in the Army even under hostile conditions, locals from Ponnakonpatti village gave a rousing welcome to Naik S Jayaprakasam, 38, and Naik D Sundaram, 38, who retired recently. As they got down from the train at Manapparai railway station on Thursday, they were surprised on seeing 23 of their Class 12 mates waiting to receive them. They were garlanded and taken in a procession with drumbeats and bursting of crackers. A feast was awaiting them at home with over 100 villagers gathered to laud their service to the nation for the last 20 years. P Elumalai, 38, one of their classmates said that both of them served in the most hostile places in their career in Jammu and Kashmir. They were engaged in counter insurgency operations and risky jobs of removing land mines.“Often such selfless service of Army personnel go unnoticed unless they die for the nation. While they remain away from their home and come only for a month or two, they could not keep in touch with relatives,” he said.“We hardly get noticed in the neighbourhood and among our relatives when we come on leave as we remain away from home for most of the months in a year. Such a reception was unexpected and memorable,” said Jayaprakasam. “While we both are going to start a new life out of the Army, such supports gives hope for a better future,” said Sundaram fighting back tears.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/village-gives-grand-welcome-to-army-men-returning-after-20-years-in-service/articleshow/81996491.cms||---
---||Agra||Agra’s SNMC runs out of emergency, ICU beds as Covid-19 cases spike||AGRA: Following a spurt in Covid-19 cases over the past two weeks, all beds in the emergency ward and intensive care unit (ICU) at SN Medical College were declared full on Friday morning. Patients were made to wait in ambulances due to the shortage of beds. Those in critical condition were referred to private hospitals. The SNMC hospital administration claimed that alternate arrangements for admitting patients were being made in other wards. Over the past four days, more than 250 Covid-19 positive cases were reported in Agra district and the number is steadily rising. As many as 67 Covid-19 cases were reported in Agra on Friday. The number of active cases increased from 486 on Thursday to 537 till Friday evening. At present, there are 80 beds in the emergency ward and 40 ICU beds are reserved for Covid-19 patients at SNMC. Over the past 24 hours, more than 100 patients were admitted in the emergency ward. The situation is so grim that some beds were occupied by two patients. This could actually cause the infection to spread among non-Covid patients admitted at the emergency ward. According to procedure, all patients admitted at the emergency ward of SNMC are tested for Covid-19. Those testing positive for the coronavirus are shifted to the Covid-19 care centre having a 120-bed capacity. Till Friday evening, 75 beds at the Covid care facility were occupied by critical patients. The shortage of beds is also a result of private nursing homes and hospitals in Agra virtually withdrawing from the battle against Covid-19 as the number of cases had dwindled to a single figure by February-end. Now, only five private nursing homes are offering their services in Agra district. According to doctors at SNMC, 90% of the critical patients have been referred by the private hospitals in Agra and neighbouring districts of Mathura, Firozabad, Etawah, Etah, Aligarh and Mainpuri. Government testing facilities have come under acute pressure due to the surge in patients. In Agra, only the district hospital and SNMC are authorized to collect samples for testing. SNMC principal Dr Sanjay Kala said, “Following a surge in the number of critical patients being admitted in the emergency ward, we have started testing patients three times a day. Those testing positive are shifted to the Covid care centre. This will reduce bed occupancy in the emergency ward.

We are increasing the bed capacity in our jumbo centres and have also asked private hospitals to add more beds for Covid care,’’ said the official. Dr Rahul Pandit, head of intensive care in Fortis Hospital and a member of the state’s Covid task force, said the next 15-21 days are most crucial for Maharashtra and Mumbai. “April will be a difficult time, but the only heartening development is that people have again begun wearing masks the right way.

---||Agra||UP Village where poet Surdas spent last days renamed: Mahmoodpur rechristened Parasauli||AGRA: In continuation of its policy to rename towns and cities, the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh has now rechristened Mathura’s village Mahmoodpur to Parasauli. Taking to TOI, secretary of Surdas Braj Rassthali Vikas Samiti, Hari Babu Kaushik, said though chief minister Yogi Adityanath had announced to rename the village during his recent visit to Vrindavan Kumbh, the notification has been issued now. According to available documents, 16th century blind devotional poet and singer Surdas had spent his last days in this village and it was known as Parasauli then. This name finds a mention in the contemporary records too. However, the name was changed during the Mughal period and the revenue record registered it as ‘Mahmoodpur’, said Kaushik. “There was a demand to restore the village to its original name. I have been writing about it since 1982 but the matter was taken up after Yogi came to power,” Kaushik said. Parasauli village is located in Govardhan. Several tourists visit this place as the kunda and samadhi of Surdas which are known as Sur-kund and Sur-samadhi are major attractions among public, said Kaushik, adding that he usually writes Surdas’s verses on walls of houses in the village and people welcome this as every corner of this village is associated with the poet. District magistrate Navneet Singh Chahal said that a long pending proposal of 2019 was approved by the government and a notification was issued last month. This is not the first time when names of villages or cities have been changed by the Yogi government. Earlier, Allahabad was rechristened Prayagraj, Faizabad as Ayodhya and Mughalsarai as Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Nagar. Not only this, Mughal Museum in Agra was renamed after Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. In fact, Ambedkar University had been asked to investigate the historical aspect of the name of Agra in 2019 as the government was planning to change its name to Agravan as demanded by many right-wing politicians.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/ups-yogi-govt-now-renames-mathura-village-where-bhakti-poet-surdas-spent-his-last-days/articleshow/81994001.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

This despite the state having a huge population using bicycles and Chennai being an early bird in devising a non-motorized transport policy.As many as 107 cities including 11 from Tamil Nadu had registered for the contest with Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Kochi figuring among the 25 chosen for the next level. They were selected based on their pilot proposals, existing infrastructure and proactive measures taken up during the lockdowns. In stage II, some of these cities will get funding to scale up their proposals. Incidentally, Chennai was the first corporation in India to adopt NMT policy in 2014. “Seeing Chennai, despite having one of the highest bicycle users in the country, failing to qualify is a disappointment. Authorities failed to even use the word NMT or bicycling to seed the thought of cycling activity for visiting nearby shops during lockdown.,” Felix John, bicycle mayor, Chennai BYCS, which promotes cycling, said. He points out that the number of cyclists in Chennai has increased drastically post the pandemic. Between January and March 2021, data generated by Strava cycling app shows that as many as 72,514 used bicycle in Chennai. This made up for 49% of people who used cycles in the entire 2020. While Bengaluru, Ranchi, Kohima and Kolkata promoted bicycling during lockdown, such measures were missing in Chennai and other TN cities. MoHUA had proposed the challenge in July 2020 among smart cities across the country and cities with more than 5 lakh population based on a survey conducted by Institute of Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) which hinted at increased usage of personalised transport.“Though TN cities registered for the challenge, many did not even submit their proposal to get evaluated,” a state-level coordinator of the challenge said. However, a senior official of Chennai smart city had a different take, “Chennai has gone way beyond the early piloting stages to now designing cycling-friendly streets under Mega streets project. We are in a more advanced stage.”Even cities like Coimbatore and Trichy did not put dedicated measures to make use of the opportunity. The officials said that they were busy with election work, tackling the pandemic and executing ongoing infrastructure projects. However, considering that the challenge was open since September and extended on multiple occasions, experts turned down these as lame excuses since other cities including Kolkata and Kochi had managed to get shortlisted despite facing similar challenges.(With inputs from Nivedha Selvam in Coimbatore and D Srikanth in Chennai)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/tn-fails-cycle-for-change-challenge/articleshow/81996499.cms||Deepak Karthik

The state board examination for Class XII students will be held from May 3-21 and practical exam from April 16-23.On Thursday, guidelines for conducting the exams safely were released by the Director of Government Examinations. The guidelines include restrictions on certain lab equipment, sanitisation, ensuring ventilation, wearing of masks, hand washing and other Covid-19 safety SOPs already in place in schools.Chemistry students should not use hand sanitisers as it is inflammable and use of pipettes, microscopic slides and even instruments like spectrometer have been restricted. “During the chemistry practical exam, students will not have to use apparatus like pipette, as there are possibilities of more than one students using it. Therefore, its usage has been avoided,” said S Anbusekaran, headmaster of government model girls higher secondary school in Manachanallur.Similarly, in Physics practicals, students will not be using spectrometer to view objects as many students will have to use see through the view finder of the same spectrometer, he said.“Students in government schools got less time to get into the laboratory to get hands-on training on the experiments due to Covid-19 restrictions. Such omissions of experiments have indeed made the practical exams relatively easier for students,” said R Arivazhagan, Trichy district chief education officer. “With Covid-19 SOPs in place, there should be no issue as the number of students in a batch is limited and examiners would be able to ensure students follow the SOPs. CBSE schools have already been able to safely conduct practical exams following Covid-19 safety guidelines,” said S Shanthi, a Class XII Physics teacher from Madurai.Guidelines have also been provided for students with Covid-19 or symptoms allowing them to give their examination at a later date. Further, if the practical examination centre or school is located in a Covid-19 containment zone, the practical exam for the students of such school shall be conducted in another school and alternate arrangements will be made by the chief educational officers. “We are praying the exams will be conducted safely without any delay. With portions reduced as well, all students are looking to score well in practicals, especially since this year theory exams are going to be a challenge due to lack of proper physical classes,” said K Srividhya, a Class XII student.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/sops-may-make-class-xii-practical-exams-tad-easier/articleshow/81996492.cms||---

In a statement, he appealed to the state chief secretary to issue necessary orders to allot the rice as done in the previous years. With five days left for the beginning of Ramzan on April 14, the IUML leader said that the administrators of the several mosques across the state had raised concerns over the silence of the government. “Though imposition of the model code of conduct (MCC) was the reason for the delay, it has been four days since the polling was over. The chief secretary of Tamil Nadu government has the authority to issue the order. So, we appeal to the chief secretary to pass the order to provide the rice,” he stated. Mohideen also appealed to the government to relax the restrictions on timing for prayers in places of worship. Tamil Nadu government had ordered to restrict the timing of prayers till 8pm from April 10 in all places of worship in the latest guidelines laid down to control the spread of the second wave of Covid-19. “Muslims will offer prayers in the night time during the fasting for 30 days during Ramzan. Hence, we request the government to relax the norms to permit the prayers to be held in the mosques till 10pm,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/iuml-urges-govt-to-give-raw-rice-to-mosques/articleshow/81996497.cms||---

A couple of days back, the letter of revised prices reached IFFCO’s marketing offices and soon went viral on social media. Farmers are contesting that already due to increase in fuel prices, the cost of cultivation of crops has gone up and, at the same time, the market prices of farm produce — be it crops, vegetables or fruits — have remained stagnant. IFFCO authorities maintained that though the revised price chart to be implemented from April 1 has been given out to all outlets, the available stock of 11.26 lakh tonnes will be sold at old price. Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Shetkari Sanghatna’s Deepak Joshi told TOI, “Citing surge in prices of raw material in international market, fertilizer manufacturers have increased the price of per bag of complex fertilizer with about Rs 600 per bag. At the same time, price of crops is not being improved proportionally, eventually making the farmers poorer, pushing him to the debt cycle.” A marginal farmer Vijay Patil said, “Until recently, tractor owners would charge Rs 1,000 for ploughing one acre of farmland. But, with the diesel prices reaching almost Rs 90 per litre, they are now charging Rs 1,500 for ploughing per acre. In addition to this, labour cost for farms, too, has increased from 20% to 40%. Whereas the price for a crop like wheat continues to remain at Rs 1,600 to Rs 2,000 per quintal. Amidst growing criticism, IFFCO managing director and CEO U S Awashti on Thursday posted a series of tweets and tried to clear the air about it. “The complex fertiliser prices mentioned by IFFCO are tentative. International prices of raw materials are yet to be finalized by companies. Indeed, there is a sharp increase seen in the international raw material price,” he wrote on Twitter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/farmers-fume-as-iffco-hikes-mrp-for-complex-fertilizers/articleshow/81993038.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Subsequently, Muthukaruppan withdrew his petition.After withdrawal of the petition, an advocate Henri Tiphagne in a letter to the court in 2019, indicated that police officers are coercing the parents of the deceased not to depose against them. He also alleged that the petition was withdrawn by the father because of threats from local police. He also submitted several audio recordings in a sealed cover to the court.Since Muthukaruppan withdrew the petition, the court had initiated suo motu proceedings in this case.It maybe recalled that Balamurugan was arrested by the police as he was one of the accused in the abduction of R Parthiban, a resident of Villapuram Housing Board for a ransom of Rs 20 lakh. Balamurugan who sustained injuries in police custody succumbed at the Government Rajaji Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/produce-people-who-convinced-man-to-withdraw-case-hc/articleshow/81994791.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra failure: Didn’t ramp up facilities in Covid lull||MUMBAI: The human suffering over the present stockouts of Covid-19 vaccines and remdesivir — the antiviral given to serious patients — and shortage of hospital beds is a reflection of the state machinery’s failure to anticipate and prepare for the second Covid wave, said experts. When Covid cases in Maharashtra and the rest of India started dropping in November 2020, the second wave was lashing parts of Europe and the US. “We could see other nations suffering, but we did nothing in the lull of three-and-half months to prepare. This has been our only failure,” admitted a senior doctor from the state health department. “We handled the first wave well and, despite the shortcomings now, the second wave too is being managed, but we could have done better by preparing for this moment,” he added. Stating that Maharashtra is going the ‘Brazil way’ with rampant spread of cases and deaths, another doctor said the government could have used the time to stock up on drugs and oxygen. “Roughly 10-20% of all Covid patients need remdesivir and around 10% need oxygen support,” he said. Considering that Maharashtra has 5.3 lakh active cases at the moment, the state needs 50,000 to 1 lakh remdesivir injections every day. Similarly, 50,000 patients need oxygen support. “If there is one drug that works for Covid-19 patients, it is oxygen support. But across the state, we are witnessing a shortage,” said the doctor. The second wave is unfortunately bigger than the first wave of the pandemic: if the highest single-day tally in September 2020, the worst month last year, was 24,619, the daily tally in the last week has been around 50,000. Moreover, the daily toll is slowly increasing , edging closer to the highest single-day tally of 515 in September. Health economist Ravi Duggal said: “Every expert knew the second wave was coming, but nothing was done to boost our primary healthcare system during the lull.” The Maharashtra budget, announced last month, too, didn’t make any big allocation for Covid or the public health system overhaul. In fact, Maharashtra has among the lowest per capita expenditure on public health at Rs 1,400. States like Himachal Pradesh and Sikkim spend three to four times more. “The Central Government Health System spends Rs 8,500 per patient and it should be used as the guiding light,” said Duggal. The state also has over 70% vacancy in posts for general and specialist doctors, especially in the rural areas. “Over 50% of the doctors in the National Health Mission are on 11-month contracts,” said Duggal. While health is a state subject, the Centre has to give 40% of the expenditure. But most of the central funds are grants meant for the National Health Mission. “The Centre has even taken away ways for states to raise resources such as sales tax and VAT. How can states manage?” he pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-failure-didnt-ramp-up-facilities-in-covid-lull/articleshow/81996528.cms||Malathy Iyer

Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala and BJP state president K Surendran submitted representations to chief electoral officer Teeka Ram Meena, demanding foolproof action from the part of the commission. Addressing a news conference, the opposition leader said the UDF succeeded to an extent in scuttling bogus voting attempts. “However, widespread malpractices are now taking place in connection with postal ballots. Fraud is suspected in the postal votes of around 3.5 lakh polling officials. Those who had cast their votes in specially arranged polling booths have started getting ballot papers through post. If they cast their postal votes, it would lead to rigging of the election. What happens in the case of postal votes are unpardonable lapses,” Chennithala said. There should have been a mechanism to eliminate the name of polling officials who already voted in specially set up polling booths. EC officials have committed a grave mistake and it should be probed whether the lapses were intentional, he added. K Surendran in his complaint said there were gross procedural lapses in the conduct, collection and handling of postal votes. The postal votes were collected without adhering to norms. Instead of sealed covers, ballots were collected in bags in several booths. “It has been learnt that unused postal ballots are misused on a large scale. The commission should take immediate steps to clear the apprehensions of political parties and candidates in this regard,” Surendran said. “The commission should specify how many postal ballot papers were printed in each assembly segment and how many such ballots were distributed among persons above 80 years of age, physically disabled and Covid patients. How many among them did cast their votes and how many more unused ballots are in the EC’s custody,” he said and wanted the commission to keep vigil against attempts to topple the democratic election process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/oppn-seeks-action-to-check-malpractices-in-postal-voting/articleshow/81994820.cms||---

However, wholesale operations shall continue.Health and civic body officials have been planning to regulate sales in the congested market ever since more than 10 positive cases were recorded in markets so far. As traders expressed reluctance to shift base once again from the Gandhi market, which was shut for more than eight months last year, several rounds of talks were held between them, corporation and the district administration. An agrement was made to shift only the retail sales of vegetables. “The measure will continue as long as the infection is brought under control in Trichy,” Ve Govindarajalu, a representative of Gandhi market traders told TOI. The temporary market will function between 6am and 2pm. While 27 traders’ organisations have agreed, a section still raised concerns over the relocation. “It is difficult to do business in open ground during summer,” a trader said. Around 800 vendors will put up stalls in the G Corner from Sunday. Corporation sources said they will take a day’s time to prepare the ground. Officials added that the vendors can only attend to customers who wear mask. Similarly, the vendors have to comply with the Covid-19 preventive measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/retail-veggie-sales-in-trichy-shifted-to-g-corner-ground/articleshow/81996501.cms||---

Considering that Maharashtra has 5.3 lakh active cases at the moment, the state needs 50,000 to 1 lakh remdesivir injections every day. Similarly, 50,000 patients need oxygen support. “If there is one drug that works for Covid-19 patients, it is oxygen support. But across the state, we are witnessing a shortage,” said the doctor. The second wave is unfortunately bigger than the first wave of the pandemic: if the highest single-day tally in September 2020, the worst month last year, was 24,619, the daily tally in the last week has been around 50,000. Moreover, the daily toll is slowly increasing , edging closer to the highest single-day tally of 515 in September. Health economist Ravi Duggal said: “Every expert knew the second wave was coming, but nothing was done to boost our primary healthcare system during the lull.” The Maharashtra budget, announced last month, too, didn’t make any big allocation for Covid or the public health system overhaul. In fact, Maharashtra has among the lowest per capita expenditure on public health at Rs 1,400. States like Himachal Pradesh and Sikkim spend three to four times more. “The Central Government Health System spends Rs 8,500 per patient and it should be used as the guiding light,” said Duggal. The state also has over 70% vacancy in posts for general and specialist doctors, especially in the rural areas. “Over 50% of the doctors in the National Health Mission are on 11-month contracts,” said Duggal. While health is a state subject, the Centre has to give 40% of the expenditure. But most of the central funds are grants meant for the National Health Mission. “The Centre has even taken away ways for states to raise resources such as sales tax and VAT. How can states manage?” he pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-failure-didnt-ramp-up-facilities-in-covid-lull/articleshow/81998403.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Dehradun||51 Uttarakhand shrines to be freed of govt control: CM at VHP meet||DEHRADUN: In a major decision on Friday, chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat while attending the Vishwa Hindu Parishad's margdarshak mandal meeting at Haridwar said that the government will denotify 51 temples from the Char Dham Devasthanam Board Act, giving control of the shrines back to priests from the hands of bureaucrats. These important places of worship are apart from the four Char Dham shrines, a call on which will be taken later. Repeating his promises to teerth purohits (priests of the shrines) who had been agitating against the Devasthanam Board Act introduced by the Trivendra Rawat government -- which brought the shrines under the control of the state government -- the CM said that his government will now review the Act. Soon after the VHP meeting, he said, “The issue was raised at the meeting and I have assured everyone that we are going to review the Act and denotify the 51 temples that are under its purview.” The constitution of the board to manage prominent shrines in the state had been announced by former CM Trivendra in December 2019; it had led to substantial backlash from the priest community which had approached the Uttarakhand high court, terming it “an infringement of traditional rights of priests to manage affairs of the temples.” They were supported by senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy who had argued their case in court. The HC had dismissed the priests’ petition last year after which Swamy had moved a special leave petition in the Supreme Court. CM Rawat’s announcement on Friday was welcomed by the teerth purohit community. “This is a great move. We were expecting that he will support our genuine demands and he has stayed true to his promise. This is going to create good atmosphere for Char Dham Yatra this year,” said Brijesh Sati, spokesperson of Char Dham Teerth Purohit Mahapanchayat, the body representing Char Dham priests. Another senior seer, Vasudevanand Saraswati, who was there in the VHP meet in Haridwar, said that even if the Devasthanam Board exists, it should be ensured that seers or priests head it and not bureaucrats. With this announcement, the CM overturned yet another decision taken by his predecessor Trivendra Rawat. Soon after taking charge last month, Tirath Rawat had withdrawn all cases registered against those who had been booked for flouting norms related to Covid-19 guidelines. He had also dismissed over 100 BJP functionaries – who were given minister or minister of state rank during Trivendra Rawat’s tenure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/51-ukhand-shrines-to-be-freed-of-govt-control-cm-at-vhp-meet/articleshow/81994006.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||Aurangabad||HC restrains state UDD minister from acting against Beed council prez||Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court has restrained the minister of state for urban development department (UDD) from proceeding with a proposal for the disqualification of the Beed municipal council president till April 21 when the latter’s petition over the matter is due for next hearing. Bharatbhushan Kshirsagar, who is president of the Beed municipal council, has challenged the disqualification proceeding as “politically motivated” and in violation of business of conduct rules as the UDD minister transferred the matter to the minister of state for UDD after taking cognizance of the proposal himself. “The rules empower only the UDD minister and not the minister of state to entertain such matters,” he contended. The HC bench of justices SV Gangapurwala and Shrikant Kulkarni observed that the present dispute was only with regard to the transfer of the proceedings from the UDD minister to the minister of state for UDD. As such it was not inclined to issue notice either to the Beed chief officer or the minister for social justice Dhananjay Munde, who is the guardian minister for the district. Instead, the bench sought to know from the government pleader the reason behind the transfer of the matter to the minister of state for UDD. The government pleader sought time to take instructions and furnish a reply following which the HC adjourned the matter to April 21 and directed retrain till then. NCP MLA Sandeep Kshirsagar had filed the disqualification proceeding against Bharatbhushan, who is his uncle. In July last year, the MLA wrote two letters to Munde alleging financial loss to the Beed municipal council due to non-payment of betterment charges and processing fees for getting layout sanctioned in Taraf Khod area of the district. He also demanded cancellation of building permission given in 2012 to a homeopathy college which was renewed in 2017, citing that the earlier permission was not signed by the town planner but was signed by the civic treasurer under the alleged influence of the municipal president. Munde had then ordered an inquiry by the district collector, who submitted his report in October 2029 to the UDD principal secretary recommending a departmental inquiry against some erring civic officials in Beed. This was followed by the MLA filing the disqualification petition before the UDD minister in December last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-restrains-state-udd-minister-from-acting-against-beed-council-prez/articleshow/81993047.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Kumar added that state governments in the country will also be asked to act tough on issues like "love jihad" and VHP office-bearers will soon start a campaign to meet governments of states from where forced religious conversions are being frequently reported. “All the seers present at the meeting were unanimous that temples should not be administered by the government. A resolution was passed on this issue and it has been decided that the government control on temples should be checked. We will also pursue the matter of temple control with governments of respective states where this is being done,” said Kumar, adding that "issues of ‘love jihad’ and conversion, done by fraud or fear, were discussed at length in the meeting”.

This is the third gram panchayat in the district to follow the electoral process prescribed under the state excise policy to impose a ban on the sale of liquor in an area. One more panchayat Brar will undergo voting next week for the same. The polling that began at 8am saw several teams of women going door-to-door requesting the families to cast their vote. The total votes polled were 2307, those who voted ‘No’ to liquor were 2,206 while those who voted ‘Yes’ did not even touch three-digit figure with 61 votes and 40 votes were declared wrong. Soon after the result was declared, women started celebrating by dancing and congratulating everyone in the village. Deeksha Chouhan, sarpanch of Thaneta, who is in her sixties, was among the first to cast vote in the polling. She recalled that years of hard work has finally paid off. “Since the first gram panchayat became liquor-free in 2016 in Rajsamand, many other panchayats hoped of getting rid of this social evil. I have seen how families have broken and lives are ruined due to liquor. Now, I can hope that future generations would never face the brunt of the poison called liquor,” said Deeksha, as told to a local scribe Lalit Devda. The road to prohibition wasn’t easy. The women in the GP under the banner of ‘Sharab Bandi Sangarsh Samiti’ had been pitching for the voting by holding protest, demonstrations, filing memorandums and petitions to the leaders. Calling it a victory of women, Bhim MLA Sudharshan Singh Rawat told TOI that a democratic process has been followed for prohibition which was pursued by women.  “It is a victory of democracy. This decision will bring prosperity in the village and end most of the disputes,” said Rawat. Upbeat over the success, villagers have taken up another challenge of having a mobile tower in the village. Mobile network rarely reaches the village and for making a call they have to walk to uphill areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/third-panchayat-in-rajsamand-district-votes-for-liquor-ban/articleshow/81995598.cms||---

Police identified the deceased as Ratheesh Kuloth from Pullookkara near Panoor in Kannur. The case falls under Valayam police station limits Police were on the lookout for Ratheesh who was allegedly part of the 11-member team that killed IUML activist Mansoor on April 6. Ratheesh, who had gone into hiding, is a neighbor of Mansoor and a CPM supporter. Meanwhile, police obtained crucial information from the mobile phone of arrested CPM activist Shinos, which gave credence to prior planning before the attack. According to sources, the accused persons had conveyed messages through WhatsApp about punishing Muhsin, Mansoor’s brother, following the poll day skirmishes between LDF and UDF activists. Police handed over the phone to cyber cell to retrieve some of the deleted WhatsApp chats. Meanwhile IUML and Congress demanded a change in the current crime branch (CB) investigation team alleging that most members were aligned with CPM. Congress leader K Sudhakaran said CB deputy SP K Ismail, who is leading the investigation, was close to CPM leaders. “We have no faith in the investigation team and are not expecting justice if they probe the case,” said Sudhakaran, adding that the murder was similar to the Shuhaib murder case in 2018. He wanted the police to invoke UAPA in this case. Sudhakaran demanded that the investigation should be led by an IPS officer. IUML national general secretary PK Kunhalikutty too raised questions about the impartiality of the probe team and said that the investigation, by the current team, was unacceptable. “At least, an officer who has a reputation of not being an acolyte of CPM should lead the investigation,” he said. Police had handed over the investigation to CB on Thursday. According to the remand report, there were 25 accused in the case, including the 11 persons identified. Police arrested only Shinos, a CPM worker who was nabbed from the crime spot on the day of attack. Meanwhile Muhsin, who was injured in the attack, said the attack was pre-planned and that he was able to identify almost all of the attackers who hailed from nearby areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/one-of-the-absconding-accused-found-dead/articleshow/81994846.cms||---

When asked about the vaccine supply, the officials of the health department clarified that a new consignment of vaccine will reach the city by Saturday evening or Sunday morning and then vaccination will be conducted at all 97 sites. On Wednesday and Thursday, vaccination was underway at only 34 sites compared to 97 sites before due to a shortage of vaccines. Apart from the 11 vaccination sites in the urban parts witnessing a heavy rush of recipients, scores of beneficiaries also moved towards the rural-based 20 community health centres to get inoculated. In the past five days (from April 3-8), over 48,000 beneficiaries were vaccinated at different sites in the city. Additional CMO and Nodal Officer (vaccination) Dr Teerath Lal told TOI that vaccination was carried out at 34 sites in the city on Wednesday and Thursday instead of 97 sites due to a shortage of vaccine. He also made it clear that the department will get a new consignment of the vaccine on Saturday evening or Sunday morning and then vaccination would resume at all the 97 sites. On Friday, vaccination was conducted on 33 sites (one less than Wednesday and Thursday) including 13 sites in urban and 20 sites in rural community health centres. As there was a shortage of vaccine, only 34 sites were selected on April 7, 8 and 9 whereas vaccination was carried at all the 97 sites on April 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6. No vaccination was carried out on Sunday (April 4). From April 1, the vaccination sites were witnessing a sizable flow of beneficiaries because of the rising Covid cases. Officials said that the jabs would be made available in both government hospitals, community \ primary health centres and private hospitals six days a week. Officials added that beneficiaries have two options: one, walk-in at centres with required documents or pre-register at CoWIN 2.0 portal. The second is to go to the scheduled place at the allotted time. “At every centre, vaccination slots have been divided between pre-registered and walk-in ratio,” said an official. On Friday, many persons above the age of 45 years, mostly related or family members, moved to rural-based community health centres in trans-Ganga and Yamuna pocket to get vaccinated. After taking a jab at CHC in trans -Ganga, a 49-year-old beneficiary said, “When I noticed rush at a government hospital in the city, I along with other recipients decided to move towards CHC. He also added that CHCs have also witnessed a sizeable crowd of beneficiaries with people lined up for their turn.” “The rising level of awareness among the target group of recipients in rural areas has encouraged them to rush to community health centres to get vaccinated,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rush-for-covid-19-vaccine-at-city-centres-amid-talks-of-shortage/articleshow/81994512.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: 8 students suspended after fight at hostel in Maharaja College||JAIPUR: After a fight between first year students, eight students of Gokhale hostel in Maharaja College were suspended by the university administration. The first year students beat up and injured their own batchmates on Wednesday night. A committee was formed at the university level that made a decision to suspend these students from the hostel. The students will be asked to vacate the hostel premises soon. Maharaja College Principal SK Gupta said, “We received a complaint that some students had a fight and immediately action was taken against these students. We have a strict policy against violence in hostels. The students are from the first year and all of them have been asked to vacate the hostel premises soon.” According to sources in the university, the senior students, who cannot harass the first year students due to strict guidelines on anti-ragging, provoked the first year students who therefore beat up other students. These tactics have been allegedly taken up by the senior-most students to harass their juniors. “We had to call up the police when the fight broke out among the students. The senior students pick first year students (for the fight) to avoid being caught under anti-ragging laws. These incidents have increased in the last few years,” said a university source. Administration suspended a few students from the hostel last month as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/8-students-suspended-after-fight-at-hostel-in-maharaja-college/articleshow/81995579.cms||---
---||Mumbai||DGP move: Netas may have had little choice||MUMBAI: Sanjay Pandey, given additional charge of DGP, was brought in as part of a clean-up operation in the wake of the state home department and police force facing charges of corruption in transfers, an official said. “The Sachin Waze episode, allegations against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh, transfer of IPS officer Param Bir Singh had an effect on the image of the police. Political leaders were left with no choice,” an official said. “I have got the order. Beyond that I have nothing to say,” Pandey told TOI. He refused to be drawn into a controversy when asked why the government suddenly found him the right candidate. The state government had in March given the additional charge of DGP to Rajnish Seth, director general, Anti-Corruption Bureau. Hemant Nagrale, who was holding the additional charge of DGP, was transferred to the city police as police commissioner. Pandey served as the DG Home Guards and was later transferred to the security corporation as DG. Pandey then wrote to the chief minister questioning how he has been assigned serious confidential inquiries in the recent past if he has not been a competent officer. The state government will seek Union Public Service Commission’s (UPSC) clearance for the DGP’s post and till then, Pandey will be holding additional charge. The state has been at the receiving end for quite some time. Former DGP Subodh Jaiswal took up a Central deputation following differences with the government for not considering his recommendations for promotions. The former state intelligence chief Rashmi Shukla’s report on corruption in police transfers also hit the government badly. “Neither the Bombay high court nor the Supreme Court came to the rescue of the government when allegations of corruption were levelled against Deshmukh,” the official said. Pandey, who was sidelined by successive governments, had even threatened to move the court against the state government’s decision for not considering him for the top post. Pandey, as a DCP, ensured that Dharavi was not impacted during the post-Babri riots of 1993. He was also credited with the busting of the shoe scam where grants for cobblers were usurped by footwear retailers. One officer recalled that when he took charge of the anti-narcotics cell of city police, almost every officer proceeded on leave as they suspected he would dust up some of the old files against them. The Economic Offences Wing (EOW), which was earlier considered a side posting, shot into the limelight after Pandey joined in the late 90s. “Every day we saw complainants queuing up outside his office. He listened to them and in some of the cases, instant justice was delivered,” an officer recalled. Pandey also served in the SPG when Narasimha Rao was Prime Minister. Pandey also dabbled in politics but realised it was not his cup of tea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dgp-move-netas-may-have-had-little-choice/articleshow/81996575.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘All kidney patients under 45 too need vaccine on priority’||Mumbai: A support group for kidney patients has urged the Prime Minister’s Office to allow Covid vaccination for kidney-failure and transplant patients of all ages.“Kidney-failure patients have to visit hospitals twice or thrice a week for dialysis, thereby exposing themselves to a higher risk of contracting Covid-19,” said Vasundhara Raghavan of Kidney Warrior Foundation, which has around 3,000 members. Given the nature of kidney disease, most patients have low immunity. “They are five to 20 times more likely to be infected than the general population due to their lowered immunity,” said Raghavan. Each patient spends 2-4 hours with other patients in hospital during dialysis and often uses public transport.“Even patients who have undergone transplants are vulnerable because they have to take immunosuppression drugs for life,” she said. The foundation wrote to the Prime Minister’s Office after realizing that many kidney-failure patients are below 45 and don’t fit the criterion for Covid-19 vaccination. A survey among 250 patient-members showed 70% of them are under 45. “Patients with kidney disease must be recognized as a priority group requiring immediate vaccination,” she said. Raghavan said a research article in ‘Kidney International’ medical journal a couple of months back said that dialysis patients face 16 to 32 % higher risk of fatality. A member of the foundation, Pratik Soni (30) from Borivli, said he wished that he and other patients with chronic kidney disease could get vaccinated. “I have to go out to get dialysis every other day and got Covid-19 and was hospitalised,’’ said Soni, who has been undergoing dialysis for 13 years now. Raghavan said that India has 1 crore patients with chronic kidney disease.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-all-kidney-patients-under-45-too-need-vaccine-on-priority/articleshow/81996571.cms||---

The UPMRC engineers have added one more achievement to their record list with the successful innovation of ‘Twin Pier Cap’ on the Metro Depot Line. UPMRC claimed that this is the first time in India, when ‘Twin Pier Caps’ have been constructed under any Metro Rail Project. A ‘depot line’ is being constructed between Gurudev and Geeta Nagar connecting the mainline and the Polytechnic Metro Depot. For cleaning of Metro Trains on the said Depot line, an ‘Automatic Train Washing Plant’ is to be installed. The width of this plant being greater than the width of Metro viaduct, there is a need of a wider base for the plant. On the Depot Line, where the washing plant is to be installed, the width of the structure of the Metro Corridor will be about 15 meters, while the width of the viaduct is about nine meters because of which the normal Pier Cap being used in the corridor is not suitable for providing base to the washing plant arrangement at the designated location and therefore, the ‘Twin Pier Caps’ have been innovated. Usually, in the structure of a Metro corridor, inverted-U portals are constructed to give a wide base for the automatic train washing plant arrangement, in which two columns (pillars) are erected on both sides of the road and then a beam is placed on them. But the use of Twin Pier Caps built by Kanpur Metro saves time and space and also beautifies the structure. UPMRC drew a Twin Pier Cap on two adjacent pillars on the same side of the road (between Geeta Nagar and Gurudev). Therefore, the space on both sides of the road did not have to be used and the time taken for construction work was also saved. A total of seven Twin Pier Caps are to be built on the Depot Line, out of which three have already been constructed. Out of seven Twin Pier Caps, three will be used to support Automatic Washing Plant while the remaining four will normalize the width of the Depot Line gradually. The length of the Automatic Washing Plant will be 54 Meters. Managing director, UPMRC Kumar Keshav said, “Twin Pier Cap is the second such successful innovation after the double T-girder, which has been implemented in the Kanpur Metro Project for the first time in the Metro Rail sector of India and it is a matter of pride for all of us. The credit for this goes to the research and innovation based working style of our Metro engineers. The entire team of UPMRC, civil contractor AFCONS and the General Consultants deserve applause on this achievement. I am quite confident that the Kanpur Metro Rail Project will emerge as a paradigm for all other Metro Rail Projects in the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/kanpur-metro-project-upmrc-uses-twin-pier-cap-to-save-time-space/articleshow/81976567.cms||---
---||Udaipur||Rajasthan: Tripura bizman hired contract killers to eliminate brother||UDAIPUR: The city police cracked a blind murder case of unidentified body that was found from shore of Udaisagar Lake last November. The body had been packed in a sack after tying his hands and legs and thrown in the lake. After failing to find any claimants for the body, the police had arranged the cremation with the help of a voluntary organisation. However, the person’s clothes, belongings and pictures were kept in police record. “The unidentified body was of Uttam Das (45), a resident of Nagpada, Agartala, West of Tripura. We have arrested the deceased’s elder brother Tapan Das (51), Rupa Das (40), wife of Uttam Das, and five Udaipur youths Rakesh Lohar (25), Surendra Lohar (30), Sanjay Harijan (32), Ajay Yadav (26) and Jaivardhan Shaktawat (24) for the murder and criminal conspiracy,” Udaipur SP Rajiv Pachar said on Friday. Police said the investigation revealed that Tapan was in illicit relationship with his younger brother's wife Rupa and therefore to remove Uttam from their way, he planned the murder. He knew one Rakesh Lohar in Udaipur and hence contacted and hired him to get Uttam killed in Udaipur. He paid Rs 12.50 lakh to Rakesh for the murder. How the elder brother planned the murder conspiracy is gripping, said the officer. Tapan sent Uttam to Udaipur via Jaipur on the pretext of seeing a site for business prospects. The plan was to get Uttam killed on the way to Udaipur. However, it did not work out and Tapan himself reached Udaipur. He along with his aide Rakesh and the accused hired an Innova car and took Tapan along. The men bought beer and meat on the way and boozed in the car. While Uttam got down to relieve himself, Tapan laced his drink with sleeping pills. After consuming the sedatives, Uttam fell unconscious and Jaivardhan strangled him to death with a belt. Later, Ajay and Jaivardhan dumped the body in a sack and threw it in Udaisagar Lake with a heavy stone tied to the sack so that the body does not resurface easily. Tapan returned home and told the family that Uttam would stay in Udaipur for business related work. “He told Rupa the truth about her husband's murder and both of them were happy. One month later, Tapan cooked a false story to break about Uttam’s death to the family. He said Uttam contracted coronavirus and died in Udaipur and his cremation has been held by the authorities,” Pachar said. He even organised a prayer meeting and held rituals for the departed soul.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/tripura-bizman-hired-contract-killers-to-eliminate-brother/articleshow/82000875.cms||---

"We used to have multiple batches of civil engineering and had more than 80% admissions for several years. The demand for the course declined over the last few years due to several reasons. Now, we have just one batch," said B Chidamabararajan, principal of SRM Valliammai Engineering College. Colleges said admissions in other core branches like mechanical, electronics and electrical engineering also have been poor. Due to a dip in admissions, around 12 colleges have opted to close electrical and electronics engineering courses too. Surprisingly, 10 colleges have opted to do away with electronics and communication engineering courses, one of the most sought after discipline. "Students are preferring computer science and allied courses. If colleges do not have accreditation, they reduce their intake or close one of their existing programmes to start new courses in emerging areas," said RM Kishore, vice-chairman of RMK Engineering College. Top colleges are starting new courses like BTech artificial intelligence and machine learning, apart from BTech computer science and design courses. As many as 44 colleges have applied to launch new courses in emerging areas this year. Career consultant Jayaprakash Gandhi said many colleges want to start computer science related courses to improve their admissions for survival. "In the computer science branch, there were only two courses — computer science and IT — till two years ago. Now, colleges offer as many as 10 new courses to attract more students. As a result, the admissions to other branches have come down," Gandhi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/30-colleges-to-close-civil-engg-courses/articleshow/81989396.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Her sister and mother had died of thallium poisoning last month, while her father is still under medical treatment. Arora had poisoned his wife’s family by mixing thallium in a fish dish he cooked in west Delhi’s Inderpuri on January 31. Police said they had identified the person who sold the thallium to Arora and are verifying some facts before making arrests. Arora, a Greater Kailash-I resident, was arrested on March 24, two days after the death of his mother-in-law, Anita Sharma, hospitalised on March 4. Her younger daughter, Priyanka, had succumbed to the poisoning on February 15. The elder daughter, Divya, Arora’s wife, was hospitalised on March 6 in a comatose state. Father-in-law, Devender Sharma, is under treatment. A police officer said that they were informed on Thursday that Divya too had succumbed to the poisoning. “Three people have died so far. Arora has been arrested. The condition of Devender Sharma is okay and he is recuperating. We have traced the company from which Arora bought thallium and we are checking if the chemical was procured through illegal means,” the officer said. Arora had not served the deadly dish to his four-year-old twin sons, giving them milk instead. Divya’s relatives have requested custody of the two boys. “We are yet to be given care of the children,” said a relative. “Divya was in coma since the first day of her hospitalisation and Arora is under medical custody. We want the strictest of legal action taken against him.” Arora told police that he had attempted to kill all members of his in-laws’ family, including his wife, because she had undergone abortion last year on her parents’ advice after developing some medical complications. Police said Arora believed the aborted foetus was the incarnation of his father, who had died in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/woman-poisoned-by-husband-dies-in-hosp/articleshow/81995612.cms||---

According to police, the court permitted custody of the accused on April 12. The accused will remain in police custody for three days. The autopsy of the girl who succumbed to injuries in Kumbazha revealed that she was sexually abused. The primary findings were that the girl was subjected to repetitive sexual and physical abuse. Multiple internal injuries were the cause of death. There were injuries all over the body too. The minor girl who was rushed to the hospital with injuries all over her body had succumbed to those on Monday. She was staying with her mother and stepfather, both from Rajapalayam in Tamil Nadu, at a rented house in Kumbazha. The mother, who is a daily wage worker, had gone to work in the morning. On her return in the afternoon, she found the girl lying inside the room with injuries all over the body. When she asked her second husband what had happened, he started beating her. She alerted the neighbours and took the girl to the hospital. However, she succumbed to the injuries. The person was arrested and was remanded. Meanwhile, the first husband of the woman had lodged a complaint that her former wife had kidnapped the girl from him. He had received the body after the autopsy and took the initiative in cremating the body at Pathanamthitta municipal crematorium. The younger brother of the victim is living with the father who is in Tamil Nadu. Meanwhile, police said that a case of kidnapping cannot be charged against the woman as she had the right to take her child. However, police will investigate whether she had remained silent when the girl was tortured by her second husband.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/minors-death-stepdad-to-be-in-3-day-police-custody/articleshow/81994855.cms||---

---||Lucknow||From hardship to hope: Devpt a silver lining for Musahars||Lucknow: When Chandrika, a member of Musahar tribe in Bhendi Jangal village of Kushinagar hailed Yogi Adityanath saying that the state government had changed his life for good, he was referring to the entire community. As many as 101 families in the village now have a house. “Jogi baba ke sarkar mein hamman ke durdasha door bhayil. Jeevan aisan badal jaai, ee te kabbo sochle nai gail rehe (The Yogi government has changed our lives. We never had the idea that life will change so much),” Chandrika said. Musahars, known as a rat-eating community, live in east UP districts and have been devoid of the benefits of social welfare schemes of successive state governments. Politically, they have not been a favourable voter base for parties. However, after the BJP formed government in 2017, things started changing for them. Kushinagar has the maximum population of musahars. About 138 gram sabhas of the district have 10,414 musahar families in 159 settlements. At least 10 blocks of the district have dominant musahar population. Most of the musahars live in 36 gram sabhas of Dudahi block and 30 gram sabhas of Khadda block. Now, members of the tribe say they are getting benefits of government welfare schemes like PM Awas Yojana, toilets, free electricity connection under Saubhagya Yojna, free cooking gas connection under Ujjawala Yojana, ration cards, job cards and access to education. Rajendra, a musahar, living in Dudahi’s Ghurpatti Bansgaon village, got his house built during lockdown under the government housing scheme. “Life has undergone a sea change in last four years. We have got ration cards, free electricity connection and many other benefits,” he said. The state government has issued 9,336 antyodaya cards to the families and people get rice, wheat and gram. At least 7,894 houses have been built under PM Awas (Grameen) Yojna. The families left out of the scheme are covered under CM Awas Yojana. At least 2,572 houses have been built under the Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana. According to government data, over 10,159 families have got toilets while 10,320 job cards have been issued under MGNREGA.

Paulpandi was thrown off the vehicle and died on the spot as he sustained severe head injuries.Following this incident, his family members filed a petition in 2017, seeking compensation and the tribunal awarded Rs 8,27,400.The counsel appearing for the appellants submitted that Paulpandi was a farmer and owned his tractor. He died at the age of 56 and was earning Rs 25,000 per month. Since the tribunal had fixed his monthly income as Rs 8,000, he sought to enhance the compensation.Justice J Nisha Banu observed that the Supreme Court in a case had fixed Rs 6,500 as monthly income for even a vegetable vendor when there was no proof of income.The judge observed that in the case on hand the deceased person was a farmer and owned a tractor due to which his income would be on the higher side. Therefore, the judge fixed his monthly income as Rs 12,000 and enhanced the compensation.Hence, the judge modified the order of the tribunal and enhanced the compensation to Rs 11,39,200 and directed the insurance company to disburse the compensation within four weeks. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-enhances-relief-to-family-members-of-accident-victim/articleshow/81994867.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Mahaveer Nagar was arrested with the bribe money that he accepted from a petrol pump owner. The then collector Indra Singh Rao was also an accused. The single bench of Justice Indrajeet Singh granted bail on the ground that the chargesheet in the case has been filed and there is no previous cases pending against him. The prosecution opposed the bail on the ground that the high court had earlier dismissed the bail plea of Rao and the bribe money was recovered from Nagar. Rao’s personal assistant was caught red-handed by the ACB for accepting bribe in lieu of issuing no objection certificate (NOC) for a petrol pump. Rao was removed from Baran collector’s post after the arrest of his PA. The action by ACB was taken on complaint of one, Govind Singh Atalpuri, who had alleged that he was asked to pay bribe in lieu of NOC for a petrol pump.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/court-grants-bail-to-baran-collectors-pa/articleshow/81995637.cms||---

---||Pune||Two accused of trying to extort Rs 10L from bizman||Pune: Two men on Thursday were booked for attempting to extort Rs10 lakh from a grocer to vacate a land parcel he had bought in Kondhwa Budruk in 2014. Police said the two men had encroached upon the land since February, 2021. Complainant Deoram Chaudhary (47) and his friend Kishore Sharma had jointly purchased the land for Rs10.5 lakh from the original owner, Shamshuddin Mulla, in 2014 after completing the legal formalities. The land had a compound wall, toilet and electric metre connection,” assistant inspector Swaraj Patil from the Kondhwa police said on Friday. Patil said, “Chaudhary visited the property on February 17 and found a sign board stating that the two suspects were legal owners of the property and that trespassers would be prosecuted. He found the existing wall and toilet were demolished to construct a new compound wall.” After Chaudhary told the two men that he was the legal owner of the property, they threatened him with dire consequences and demanded Rs10 lakh to vacate the land, the officer said. “We registered an FIR after receiving a complaint application from Chaudhary on Thursday,” he added. On the delay in registering the FIR, the investigation officer said,“During the preliminary inquiry, the suspects claimed that they were legal owners of the property and furnished documents in support of their defence. We are now conducting an inquiry with local residents, the original land owner and checking the land records to establish the identity of the owner of the disputed property. After collecting evidence, we will consult our superiors and seek legal opinion to take a final decision.” “We have registered an extortion case against the duo. The documents submitted by the disputed parties will be verified during the investigations,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-accused-of-trying-to-extort-rs-10l-from-bizman/articleshow/81994868.cms||---

In the December Electricity (Rights of Consumers) Rules, 2020, it had restricted the net metering benefits to projects with load of 10kw which invited an avalanche of representations from the industry for a review. Following the Union Ministry of Power (MoP) guidelines issued earlier, Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission (RERC) had also capped the net metering to projects upto 10kw which triggered widespread protests by the industry. Earlier, the cap was 1 megawatt (1000 kilowatt). Under the net metering system, the solar rooftop generators are allowed to use the power they produce and get a pre-fixed amount for the extra renewable energy they supply to the grid. In the gross metering, the generators cannot use the rooftop energy but were to be paid by the discoms at rates which was considered unviable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/partial-relief-on-cards-for-rooftop-solar-projects-in-raj/articleshow/81995631.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Two murder mysteries solved, six in police net||New Delhi: The mystery of two unidentified bodies found on the roadside in Samaypur Badli and Wazirabad on April 4 and 5 has been solved. The first was the result of a woman plotting her husband’s murder with her boyfriend’s help, while the second death occurred after a brawl between two friends after one of them misbehaved with the other’s wife. In the first case, five people, including a juvenile, have been apprehended. The deceased was identified as Wasi Ahmed. The prime accused, Mukesh (32), had an illicit relationship with Ahmed’s wife Farzana (35). He had roped in his friends, Sachin (19), Vikas (20) and the juvenile, to commit the crime. A team led by ACP Vivek Bhagat and inspector Anil Kumar was formed to investigate the case. DCP (Outer-North) Rajiv Ranjan Singh said, “After scanning CCTV footage and analysing technical details, Farzana was nabbed, who led cops to the others.” She fell in love with Mukesh when her husband was admitted in a drug rehabilitation centre. When Ahmed returned, he beat her up for being in the illicit relationship, which prompted her to plan the murder. On April 3 night, Ahmed was stoned and bludgeoned to death in Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar. In the second case, one Ravinder Ravi was arrested for the murder of the man found in Wazirabad. Police had received a call about the body around 7.15am on April 5. The body was identified through a tattoo on the deceased’s hand, which read Sonu. DCP Anto Alphonse said, “Cops found Rs 590 in Sonu’s pockets, so a robbery bid was ruled out. They finally zeroed in on Ravi, who told them that he had gone to Sonu’s house late at night for liquor.” As Sonu stepped out to buy alcohol, Ravinder began to misbehave with his wife. When Sonu returned, they got into a fight. Ravinder later killed him at an isolated spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/two-murder-mysteries-solved-six-in-police-net/articleshow/81995638.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Internal unrest in parties surface||Thiruvananthapuram: Hardly three days after the polling to assembly election, discontent in political parties over electioneering has started coming out. While CPI has recommended action against local leaders who allegedly worked against the party candidate in Cherthala, Congress has said it would look into the allegations that there were serious lapses in the election campaign of party candidate Veena S Nair in Vattiyoorkavu. According to sources, CPI Karuva local committee that met in the presence of the outgoing food and civil supplies minister P Thilothaman decided to suspend from the party the minister’s personal staff member P Pradyut. Several local leaders and workers close to Thilothaman were allegedly not active in the election campaign as the party decided against fielding any of the ministers during this election. However, the suspension would be effective only if the Cherthala mandalam committee ratifies the local committee’s decision. The CPM leaders in Cherthala too have reportedly expressed dismay over the allegedly shoddy election work by certain CPI leaders in Cherthala seat. However, CPI is still confident of a comfortable victory of P Prasad who replaced Thilothaman as the party candidate. Meanwhile, KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran on Friday said an inquiry would be conducted into the allegations that several Congress leaders did not work well for the victory of the party candidate Veena S Nair in Vattiyoorkavu. Earlier on the day, several bundles of unused posters of Veena were found in a scrap store in the city. Youth Congress leaders and district Congress committee have also filed complaints with police, seeking inquiry into its misuse. In the meantime, senior Congress leader A K Antony’s son Anil Antony has come under severe criticism from pro-UDF cyber groups, allegedly for not living up to the expectations as the head of the IT cell formed by KPPC ahead of the assembly election. However, Anil has dismissed the allegations as baseless. Anil is currently the in-charge of the AICC’s social media and is involved in framing the social media strategy for Congress in Puduchery and Karnataka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/internal-unrest-in-parties-surface/articleshow/81994870.cms||---

---||Kochi||CPM will improve tally in Palakkad, finds survey||Palakkad: A booth-level micro analysis of voting pattern of April 6 assembly elections in the district by Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM) said that it would improve its present tally from 9 out of 12 total seats in the district. The party would win the most fiercely-fought Thrithala assembly segment by a margin of nearly 3,000 votes, it said. The assessment showed that LDF had an upper hand from the very beginning of the campaign in Thrithala. The party says that Pattambi, Malampuzha and Nemmara witnessed tough political fight between LDF and UDF. Despite the allegations of trading of votes by UDF to NDA in Malampuzha, LDF will retain the seat with at least 10,000 votes though the previous margin of V S Achuthanandan was over 25,000 votes. Though Ottapalam witnessed a close fight between LDF and UDF, and NDA closely behind, the LDF could retain the seat with a margin of over 8,000 votes. The party is sure that LDF will retain Alathur, Tarur, Kongad, Ottapalam, Shoranur and Chittur. The party assessment also shows that there are possibilities of capturing UDF strongholds of Palakkad and Mannarkakd assembly segments this time. It said that there was better acceptance of LDF candidates in all the 12 assembly seats and more minority votes came in favour of LDF this time, as there was fear of BJP strengthening in the state and that only LDF could stop it. The CPM assessment is that the pro-government attitude of various sections of people towards its social welfare and development measures and the LDF election promise of honorarium for home makers, etc, will tilt the balance in favour of LDF to retain power in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cpm-will-improve-tally-in-palakkad-finds-survey/articleshow/81994913.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The murders took place in the Bhinai town of the district early on Thursday. Amarchand was arrested soon after the crime and the police took his custody from court and started his interrogation. Police, unable to find the reason behind the crime, interrogated the accused and asked questions from family members and neighbours. Police said that it is confirmed that accused Amarchand is a man of bad temper and picked up fights on small things. He usually talks about getting a job and to marry. Police questioned neighbours and said that they revealed that he usually does not roam outside and was preparing for the REET exam after completing his bachelor’s of education degree. While interrogating the accused, police said that he repeated that he had food with his family on Wednesday night and after that, there was no fight and he went to his room and slept. After midnight, he had a dream to kill all family members and therefore, he took the hammer from the gallery where the father of the accused worked as a carpenter and first killed his 65-year-old mother Kamala and then his 22-year-old brother Shivraj. He later went to kill his three other brothers and attacked them. Police also verified the details with relatives but they too denied any struggle or fight within the family. Relatives told police that Amarchand talks less but there was no struggle within the family, related to property or anything. “We are trying to pin down the reason behind the incident,” added a senior police official. He added that the first probability is that accused Amarchand is mentally ill and therefore, they also sent the accused for medical examination. Police are also verifying whether he was under treatment for stress or depression.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/got-command-in-dreams-to-murder-family-members/articleshow/81995640.cms||---

In the video, which was shared by several netizens, including Shalabh Mani Tripathi, the media advisor to chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Yadav was heard saying, “If anybody is under any illusion that by pressuring and threatening voters one can win elections and if I get to know about it, I will make your life hell.” In the video, he was also purportedly asking the people to reject those candidates who offer liquor and cash in lieu for vote. “Such a candidate whose intention is already bad, what good can he do for you and your village,” he was heard as saying in the video. Keeping in mind the sensitivity of the panchayat elections in Muzaffarnagar, the SSP and district magistrate Selva Kumari J have been visiting various villages every day, especially those places which had witnessed violence during the past elections. When asked about his speech, the SSP said, “We are going to every village, especial those villages which have a record of violence in the past. We are keeping special surveillance and meeting with the public. Our aim is to conduct a fair and peaceful election. We won't tolerate any nuisance.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/will-make-your-life-hell-muzaffarnagar-ssp-warns-panchayat-election-candidates-if-found-indulging-in-mischief/articleshow/81993950.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Delhi||SC says protesters cannot block public roads for long||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday reiterated that public roads cannot be blocked for long by protesters and there should be free flow of traffic and impleaded Uttar Pradesh and Haryana governments on a petition seeking clearance of roads at Delhi borders blocked by farmers agitating against farm bills. A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hemant Gupta made it clear that it was not dealing with the larger issue of farms laws which could be dealt with politically, judicially or administratively but it was concerned about the blocking of roads. The court said there cannot be continuous inconvenience for people for a long time by the agitators by blocking roads and some arrangements had to be made so that people do not suffer. It posted the hearing for April 19. Earlier, the bench had issued notice to the Delhi Police on the plea of a Noida-based woman who alleged that it took her more than two hours to commute due to the road block. She alleged in her petition that she is a single parent and it has become a nightmare to travel to Delhi and sought the court’s intervention. She alleged in her petition that the agitation was being done to defame the government and the country by opposing the laws passed by Parliament. The Supreme Court had last year ruled that the authorities, in future, should not permit Shaheen Bagh-type protests involving blocking of roads and public spaces, and said such expression of dissent should be organised at designated places without causing inconvenience to the public at large. Striking a balance between the democratic right to protest and need to spare people the inconvenience resulting from blockades, the court had said staging protests is a constitutional right and emphasised that an issue being sub judice could not be a deterrent for an agitation on the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-says-protesters-cannot-block-public-roads-for-long/articleshow/81995664.cms||---

---||Chennai||Tech colleges need to reconfigure to stay relevant: Surappa||Amid the current crisis among engineering colleges including poor admissions, Anna University vice-chancellor M K Surappa in an interview to Ragu Raman speaks on the reasons and the way forward. Excerpts Q: More than 15% of technical institutions shut in the past three years in TN. What is the main reason for this? The closure of engineering institutions is happening not only in Tamil Nadu, but across the country because of poor admissions. Q: What are the reasons for the dip in admissions in the past few years? It is because colleges have been admitting too many students in engineering programmes and producing too many engineering graduates beyond the needs of the society and carrying capacity of the country. The quality of engineering education offered in many colleges is bad due to poor infrastructure and lack of faculty members. Except for services sector, manufacturing and construction are not doing well. Q: What do engineering colleges in the state lack? From my experience at Anna University, many colleges lack good faculty. In the past, colleges have shown the same faculty members in different colleges, library books have been borrowed and instant libraries set up for inspection. Colleges must gain the respect of affiliating bodies like university and AICTE, not suspicion. Q: You brought in experts from IIT, NIT and IISc to inspect engineering colleges. Has it improved quality? Faculty members from those institutions have seen better systems and infrastructure. They were able to bring better benchmarks while inspecting colleges. It has certainly helped in improving standards. Q: TN still has the highest number of engineering colleges in the country. What does the future hold? We need to ensure the survival and relevance of engineering colleges that have already started. They must reconfigure themselves towards emerging technologies to stay relevant. Engineering colleges must adapt to give diplomas and certificate programmes to skill students in emerging areas rather than struggling and producing poor quality engineers. Q:Private colleges and deemed universities seek special aid for Covid-19. What is your view? If a good educational institution is suffering because of this problem, I think the government should help.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tech-colleges-need-to-reconfigure-to-stay-relevant-surappa/articleshow/81989501.cms||---

Medical education minister Amit Deshmukh suggested retired nurses and doctors be called back for at least three months so that trained manpower can be added. With cases surging, government wants to add beds and doctors to the fight. “If private doctors extend services to jumbo centres, it will help treat patients and help build confidence among people regarding the centres,” said Thackeray. A doctor-administrator who attended the meeting said the focus was on increasing beds, ensuring only those who need them are admitted and Remdesivir stocks. “The civic chief said even if each hospital adds one bed extra, Mumbai can get hundreds of extra beds right away,” he said. Joy Chakraborthy of Hinduja Hospital (Mahim), who attended the meet, “We continue to maintain the same number of Covid beds as we did last year. As BMC has urged used to provide more beds, we are adding 14-15.” Health minister Rajesh Tope said a dashboard should be activated in each district and the Mumbai model of a central dashboard from where beds availability can be monitored and bed allotment can be done should be implemented. He said use of Remdesivir should be regulated, and medical services be charged as per rates capped by government. There is a shortage of beds in the city due to the surge in cases; while BMC is adding beds at its hospitals, most affluent patients want beds in private sector. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/adopt-jumbo-covid-centres-add-beds-maharashtra-cm-tells-pvt-hosps/articleshow/81996623.cms||---

The drug which has a shelf-life of three months, earlier was priced at around Rs 3,200 to Rs 5,500, but later after government intervention its cost was brought down to Rs 1,200. However, the production of the anti-viral drug was halted or slowed down by the three leading manufacturing pharmaceutical companies presuming the fall in corona cases post December 2020. Speaking to TOI, Suresh Kumar, the general secretary of Lucknow Medicine Wholesale Association said, “Not a single vial is available in the state capital. We are in touch with pharmaceutical companies and expect to receive consignment within two days.” Dr Prabhat Agrawal, the renowned physician and professor of medicine department, SN Medical College, Agra said, “There are a number of studies which suggest that Remdesivir is not necessarily effective in Covid-19 patients, but still it can be administered to patients who are in critical condition. The drug is either unavailable or very less in number in the UP medicine market.” According to sources, the drug is available in black market for Rs 10,000 or more, though according to government guidelines, the drug can be bought only after showing Aadhaar and doctor’s prescription. Meanwhile, sources confirmed that Remdesivir was also out of stock in a few government hospitals. Several attempts were made to contact chief medical officer, district magistrate, chief development officer and even divisional commissioner for their comments on the acute shortage of drugs in the state capital, but none responded till this report was filed by late night.

Apart from this, another list will be made of the unregistered shelters which are operating across Rajasthan and all the data of the registered shelters will be made public so as to create awareness amongst the masses about them. “The shelters which are being run illegally without registration will be identified and action will be taken against them as per the rules. The data of the registered shelters will be made available so that public can differentiate between the ones which are recognised and those which are illegal,” said Sangeeta Beniwal, chairperson, Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights. This comes on the heels of a case in Bharatpur where a 12-year-old boy was sodomised by director of a registered shelter home over a prolonged period and another 10-year-old boy had also been subjected to same harassment by the accused. Orders have been issued to cancel the recognition of the Jeevan Jyoti children shelter which served as a halfway home for minors who had no guardians to look after them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/child-commission-to-keep-tabs-on-functioning-of-shelter-homes/articleshow/81995662.cms||---

Gurdwara Yahiyaganj, the place which was constructed in 17th century in the memory of Guru Tegh Bahadur, who is believed to have stayed at the site when he visited Lucknow while travelling from Patna Sahib in 1670, will organise celebrations only after getting prior permission from the district administration. “Ragi Jattha (a group of people who recite kirtan and play musical instruments) have been called from Gurdwara Paonta Sahib, Amritsar, Ganganagar and several other places for a programme to be organised at Bal Sangrahalay on April 1. However, we will go ahead for it only after getting prior permission from the district administration. Besides, Gurdwara Yahiyganj will be open for devotees who can attend ‘shabad-kirtan’ while maintaining Covid protocols,” said Manmohan Singh of Gurdwara Yahiyganj. Naka Hindola, Alambagh and Mansarovar gurdwaras will also do away with large processions around the city. “Nagar Kirtan and Jagriti Yatra will be cancelled since large crowd of devotees might want to join. Essay competitions in schools and colleges are likely to be postponed. We are plannning to organise smaller events which can be live-streamed online. We will distribute literature on the Sikh guru and ‘langar sewa’ will be organised for the public amid Covid safety precautions like we have been doing since lockdown,” said Satpal Singh Meet, religious secretary of Gurdwara Naka Hindola. Earlier in February, UP Punjabi Academy had organised a theatre show in Ravindralaya on the life and times of the Sikh guru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/low-profile-celebrations-on-guru-tegh-bahadurs-anniv/articleshow/81996619.cms||Aditi Singh
---||Jaipur||Med staff fails to report silicosis cases to regulator||Jaipur: In violation of the silicosis policy implemented in 2019, the medical authorities are not notifying the cases to the Directorate General of Mines Safety (DGMS), which has the mandate to ensure workplaces are hazard-free and welfare of persons employed in mines are taken care of.In the absence of data, DGMS is unable to inspect the mines and quarries where the risk of developing the disease is very high.The policy ensures that silicosis victims have to register themselves at a nearby e-mitra outlet and are then called in for screening at the nearest health centre. After the screening, the medical authority gives the certification to the silicosis victim but does not notify DGMS.“Silicosis is a notifiable disease under Mines Act 1952. However, it is not getting notified which is leading to a high number of cases. The policy has failed to control the spread of silicosis and the situation is the same as it was a decade ago,” said Rana Sengupta of Mine Labour Protection Campaign.Sengupta said that it is the responsibility of the regulatory authorities to ensure prevention and control of silicosis. “Without these interventions, the policy will be reduced to a process of diagnosis and compensation alone,” he added.Through suitable legislation, rules, regulations, standards and guidelines, DGMS builds in adequate measures to ensure compliance and awareness initiatives to inculcate safety and health culture amongst workers and stakeholders.Last year, the DGMS had written a letter to the department of Mines and Geology in Udaipur about the lack of coordination which is hurting the efforts to prevent the incidences of silicosis.While many mine and quarry operators are not paying heed to the safety standards putting the lives of workers at risk, there is no monitoring that is undertaken due to lack of data and coordination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/med-staff-fails-to-report-silicosis-cases-to-regulator/articleshow/81995666.cms||---

The dance video based on Boney M’s hit song ‘Rasputin’ had received wide acclaim for its energy and artistic quality as well as some brickbats from certain people who gave a communal tone to their criticisms . The criticisms were mainly referring to the fact that Razak is a Muslim while Janaki is a Hindu. There were some attempts to link the dance with ‘love jihad’. When contacted both Janaki and Razak said they are undisturbed by the criticisms. “They don’t deserve a reply. The families of both of us are not worried by these criticisms,” said Janaki. “Let them say whatever they want, we will continue to post dance videos,” said Razak. “This was a popular song, and we posted the dance without any particular intention, and are happy that it has gone viral,” said Janaki. While Razak is a final year student, Janaki is a third year student. College union chairman John Sangeeth said the union thought of posting the new dance video to support Razak and Janaki, as we wanted to counter an attack on such a beautiful dance. The new video titled, “If the intention is to hate, then our decision is to resist”. About ten students of the college are participating in the new video.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/medicos-viral-dance-video-gets-college-union-backing/articleshow/81994953.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Postponement of exams to further delay LU session, students anxious||Lucknow: The first-year undergraduate and post-graduate students of Lucknow University are having sleepless nights as postponement of examinations has further delayed their academic session. Already delayed by four months, the first-year students were to appear for their examinations from April 6 but due to rise in Covid-19 cases, papers have been postponed till further notice. The first semester examination of the new batch is held every year in December while the second semester is held in May. Due to pandemic, the first-semester examination was delayed and scheduled for April. Examinations have again been postponed due to which students are apprehensive that their academic session may get delayed by 10-11 months. “Our first year would have been completed by May but uncertainty haunts us now. LU is closed till April 15 and according to our teachers, the examinations will be on hold till Covid-19 cases go down. If these examinations are held in May or June, we will lose six months,” said BA student Jagriti Singh. “These months will have an impact on our career planning. We won’t have the luxury of dropping a year to prepare for examinations as we have already lost so much time due to delay in admissions and examinations,” she added. “Even if semester examinations are held in May, the results will be out by June and our second semester examination will be scheduled at least after three months of teaching which means the second semester examination which otherwise would have been completed in June will be over in October or so,” said BA (Hons) Vishal Singh. He said the delay would affect further studies, internships and placements. LU spokesperson Durgesh Srivastava said, “The university is closed till April 15. The new examination schedule will depend on pandemic situation. Students need not worry. The university will speed up evaluation and conduct extra classes to avoid session delay.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/postponement-of-exams-to-further-delay-lu-session-students-anxious/articleshow/81996628.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Not new strains, carelessness cause of spurt, say experts||HYDERABAD: City scientists and public health experts say it’s negligence and not a new variant that is causing a spurt in Covid-19 cases in Hyderabad and parts of Telugu states. Covid-19 cases are likely to create a new record, if this carelessness among people continues, they warn. Scientists from the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) clarify that so far, they have not come across a new variant in Hyderabad or in AP or Telangana linked to the sudden spurt. The variant, N440K, has been present for long in Telugu states, but it is not responsible for the increase in pandemic cases. The double variant has been found only in one or two cases so far in Telugu states. It is largely carelessness that is behind the rise, said Dr Rakesh K Mishra, director, CCMB. Public health experts from the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) and the Indian Institute of Public Health (IIPH), Hyderabad, too point out that there has been a lot of negligence in following the Covid-19 protocol by people and this is showing in terms of the increased numbers of positive cases. They suggest strict adherence to Covid-19 protocol. The Covid-19 curve in Hyderabad had flattened in December 2020 if a municipal waste water surveillance study by the CCMB is any indication. But the cases began to increase as more people breached the protocol. Prof GVS Murthy, director, Indian Institute of Public Health, Hyderabad, said the increase is due to multiple factors. “There is a sense of liberation in people’s perception that Covid-19 is no longer a threat and people have let their guard down. There is overcrowding in markets and other public places. There is increased transmission potential with some of the mutant strains which were first imported to Maharashtra and then spread right across the country," Dr Murthy said. CCMB scientist Divya Tej Sowpaty said at present there is no clear evidence for a variant to be causing spikes everywhere. It is most probably because of people not following Covid appropriate behaviour. Control measures would be to introduce restrictions, particularly on non-essential services. Dr Vijay Kumar Chennamshetty, consultant interventional pulmonologist, Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad, said the thought among public that vaccine will completely protect them had led many to avoid masks and social distancing. However, some experts did not rule out the possibility of a new strain. Dr A Laxmaiah, head, division of public health nutrition, NIN, told TOI that the reasons could be several including new variants with more virulence. "Non-compliance of non-pharmacological measures like not wearing masks always, not following social distance, not following frequent sanitization are also responsible," Dr Laxmaiah said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/not-new-strains-carelessness-cause-of-spurt-experts/articleshow/81994965.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Delhi||A Police Station Where All Are Welcome Among India’s Top 10||New Delhi: Begumpur police station in outer Delhi has been selected the city’s best police station and one of the top 10 in India. The police station had focused community engagement and taken steps to ensure accessibility for everybody. It installed 400 CCTV cameras in areas within its jurisdiction with the help of residents and also roped in the local youth for patrolling to catch some chain snatchers and robbers. On Friday, police commissioner S N Shrivastava presented the certificate of excellence given by the Union home ministry to inspector Jai Bhagwan, SHO, Begumpur. Pranav Tayal, DCP (Rohini) was also present on the occasion. Begumpur area has a diverse population of over two lakhs. Police emphasised community policing and engaged people to work along with officers. The initiative also included regular interaction with RWAs and with senior citizens through WhatsApp groups for grievance redress. The SHO also involved good Samaritans and youth in curbing crime in the area. The community initiatives yielded good results after youths in Rohini’s Sector-37, along with police personnel, carried out patrolling in the night and helped nab a gang of snatchers and robbers. For easier accessibility, the beat staff is briefed on a regular basis and are kept informed about everything related to the area. The beat personnel have been instructed to ensure their phone numbers are available to the citizens so that they can be easily contacted at times of need. From child-friendly rooms to digitalisation of records, the Begumpur police station has it all. Special emphasis was given to welfare of the staff, including provision of high-quality work environment, hygienic barracks and toilets, mess facilities, weekly rest for the staff and rewards for good work. Further, in order to promote standardised delivery of services to the public, constant efforts are being made on the digitalisation of records and processes. The ranking is done based on parameters determined by the home ministry annually. They were developed along the lines of the directions given by PM Narendra Modi to police directors-general at the 2015 conference in Kutch, Gujarat. Surveys were conducted across the country, with minimum notification time given to the police stations so as to capture actual results. The selection of the police stations was based on data analysis, direct observation and public feedback. The survey team also randomly visited various areas. In Begumpur, it visited Rajiv Nagar, Jain Nagar and Begumpur and recorded the citizens’ feedback. They also monitored checkings conducted at the pickets and the on-ground situation. The survey team also analysed the CCTNS entries and records of the police stations and visited the malkhanas. It inspected the basic amenities for visitors, waiting areas, toilets, drinking water, the public facilitation desks, barracks, rooms for women constable, safety and security of the armoury and other parameters as per the standards of the country’s best police stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-police-station-where-all-are-welcome-among-indias-top-10/articleshow/81995685.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The decision by Justice PV Asha came on a petition filed by 21-year-old Naveed MC alias Noufal of Parandode near Nedumangad in Thiruvananthapuram. He had taken out a gazette notification on December 8, last year changing his name from Noufal to Naveed and his religion and caste from Islam and Muslim to Hindu Kanikkaran. It was on the basis of a caste certificate issued by the tahsildar. However, his application to change name, religion, and caste in SSLC certificate was rejected by the Joint Commissioner for Entrance Examinations. There is no such procedure and the gazette notification can be produced along with the SSLC certificate wherever necessary, the joint commissioner had informed the petitioner while rejecting his plea. At the high court, advocate AS Shammy Raj, who represented the petitioner, relied on the judgments of the high courts of Madras and Punjab and Haryana in similar cases. Ruling in favour of the petitioner, the Kerala High Court said in the judgment, “It cannot be disputed that the petitioner’s name, religion and caste have already been altered and it is published in the Gazette also. It will not be possible for the petitioner to produce the Gazette notification for the purpose of higher studies and for the purpose of employment when online applications are called for and the entire proceedings are being held in digital media. Therefore, even in the absence of any specific provision, it is necessary that appropriate rectifications are made in the certificate on the basis of the correction already made with respect to the name, caste and religion of the petitioner.” The court then set aside the joint commissioner’s rejection order and ordered the joint commissioner to issue an SSLC certificate showing the corrected name, religion, and caste of the petitioner, as Naveed MC who belongs to Hindu Kanikkaran community, within six weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/gazette-notification-enough-for-change-in-sslc-certificate/articleshow/81994976.cms||---

Mehboob Shaikh, 45, is the manager of the Nashik Municipal Corporation-run crematorium for a decade. The flow of bodies at Amardham, located on the banks of river Godavari, has swelled over the past few days. Shaikh, who has been posted at Amardham for nearly a decade, has been working tirelessly to help the bereaved families to complete the final rites. “I do not have any hesitation in working at a crematorium meant for Hindus. I feel that it’s a pious job to help the dead in their final journey,” said Shaikh. He has to maintain the cleanliness of the crematorium premises, ensure all basic amenities are in place and the proper functioning of the two electric and one gas crematoriums. This apart, he has to see that there is enough wood for the 14 traditional pyres. He also completes the paperwork before bodies are allowed to be cremated. “There are many cases when bereaved families leave the bodies at the crematorium without performing the last rites as they are fearful of getting Covid-19 infection. We then perform the last rites,” Shaikh told TOI. Although there are six crematoriums spread across the city, the rush at Amardham is always greater. This crematorium handles over 15-20 bodies a day. “The pain of the families losing their beloved are much more than our workload. You can clearly see when they arrive at Amardham with the bodies with moist eyes,” said Shaikh. Sunil Sirsath, sanitary inspector of East Nashik division of NMC, lauded Shaikh for his. “I feel that he has set an example for all of us. Despite hailing from a different community, he is working at the Hindu crematorium. He has been working well to manage that crematorium,” added Sirsath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/muslim-man-manages-crematorium-wins-hearts-in-covid-times-in-nashik/articleshow/81994980.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

The order will be applicable till April 30. Additional chief secretary (health) Amit Mohan Prasad shot a letter to the district magistrates of the four sensitive districts on Friday, asking them to implement the order with immediate effect. “In view of the rising cases of Covid-19 and to break the chain of infection, it has been decided that in your districts, only 50% of the staff in government and private offices will attend work on any given day. Arrangements should be made to allow the remaining staff to work from home,” he said.

For government offices, including the secretariat, Vidhan Sabha and Vishan Parishad secretariats, chief secretary RK Tiwari has said that a weekly roster system should be made for all employees with an exception of class I officers. The order will also not be applicable to staff directly associated with Covid-19 or other emergency work. “This particular strain of the virus is highly infectious and the government’s aim is to limit the number of people who can be exposed to an infected person. This will also ensure that work is not affected as offices are not being shut down completely,” said an official.

Responding to petitions filed by the secretary of Legislative Assembly and S Sharma MLA seeking a directive to conduct the Rajya Sabha polls during the term of the current Legislative Assembly, the Election Commission said Rajya Sabha polls cannot be linked to the Assembly’s term. In a statement filed to the court, the Election Commission said the electoral college to elect the three Rajya Sabha members is the members of the Legislative Assembly. As the election to the Legislative Assembly was held on April 6, it is the newly-elected members of the Assembly who have to vote for selecting the Rajya Sabha members, the court was told. New Legislative Assembly members electing the Rajya Sabha members would be the correct action constitutionally. Allowing the members of the present Legislative Assembly would not be in tune with the will of the people, Election Commission has submitted. The court was also informed that the announcement for conducting the Rajya Sabha polls was put on hold to seek legal opinion. The Election Commission has the duty to announce the schedule of the election before the terms of the Rajya Sabha members expire and it will do so, Election Commission told the court. The court has now reserved the case for pronouncing its judgment. The high court had on Wednesday asked the Election Commission to place on record the reasons for postponing the elections. The tenure of Rajya Sabha members from Kerala — Vayalar Ravi of Congress, K K Ragesh of CPM and P V Abdul Wahab of Indian Union Muslim League — will end on April 21. The elections to the three Rajya Sabha seats were originally scheduled from April 12 to 16. A counsel representing the Election Commission had submitted that notification for the Rajya Sabha elections will be issued before April 21. However, counsels representing the petitioners questioned why the election schedule has not been announced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/new-state-assembly-will-vote-ec-tells-hc/articleshow/81995007.cms||---

There are around 1,500 mid and small-sized IT enterprises in the Telangana. “The suggestions you have made are right ones... we will be formalising all that into policy, into GOs…into actionable points in days to come,” Ranjan said while addressing participants at the Hyderabad Software Enterprises Association’s (Hysea) BizSummit 2021 on Friday. With Covid-19 accelerating the pace of digital transformation across sectors, it offers lucrative opportunities for Telangana’s IT MSMEs to tap new markets such as Latin American and Africa, among others, to boost growth, he added. Apart from tapping new overseas markets, these MSMEs can explore digitisation business opportunities in the areas of education and agriculture, he said. “This is like the new Y2K…there are enormous opportunities for MSMEs as opportunities are democratised now,” he said. Bharani K Aroll, President, Hysea, said a considerable part of state’s IT revenues comes from MSMEs and a special policy will give a boost. Rajesh Nambiar, CMD, Cognizant Technology Solutions said the pandemic has widened divide between digital natives and legacy economy companies struggling to shift to a fully digital model. “As more organisations look to become more digital quickly, secular trend of digital transformation is going to be the key driver of growth for the IT industry,” he said.

It is important to ensure that the spread of the disease is controlled, but at the same time it should be ensured that the normal life is not affected.

---||Hyderabad||Pandemic cloud: TDR turns lifeline for major projects||Hyderabad: Despite the pandemic denting the coffers of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), transfer of development rights (TDR) turned out to be the biggest lifeline for the city ensuring execution of several infrastructure projects. The civic body saved over Rs 1,500 crore towards cash compensation due to TDR and ensured projects — especially construction of link roads and flyovers — were executed on time, officials said. Amid restrictions, owing to the spike in Covid-19 cases, the scheme turned into a win-win situation for property owners, builders, developers and government. Though TDR concept was introduced a decade ago, till mid-2019, only 115 TDRs were issued. However, with introduction of new policy in 2017 and subsequent amendments, officials said that the property owners opting for TDRs increased along with increase in the city’s infrastructure works. Till date, 807 TDRs have been issued. TDR is made available for certain additional built-up area in lieu of the area relinquished or surrendered by the land owner, so that he can use extra built-up area or transfer it to another for a sum. “Apart from additional property value, the provision to sell or purchase TDR has also been an attractive factor. Under the scheme, the extra built-up area could either be utilised by the property owner or sold to others which is a reason builders and realtors come forward to opt for TDR,” said a GHMC official. Though the TDR concept was introduced a decade ago, the government had issued a GO in 2017 and extended more benefits for property owners. Speaking at a review meeting at the GHMC headquarters this week, municipal administration and urban development minister KT Rama Rao asked officials said that link road works and the Comprehensive Road Maintenance Programme were progressing on fast track. He said, “A TDR worth Rs 2,800 crore was submitted for various land acquisitions. The officials are reviewing work under the SRDP as well. As many as 21 works taken up under SRDP have been made available for public while another 17 works would be completed soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pandemic-cloud-tdr-turns-lifeline-for-major-projects/articleshow/81994979.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Goa||Nearly 6,800 trees felled for ongoing highway expansion across Goa||PANAJI: Nearly 6,800 trees have been felled for the ongoing work of highway expansion from Patradevi in North Goa to Collem in South Goa, state records indicate. The highest number of trees have been cut along the Patradevi-Karaswada stretch, with 3,232 trees axed to make way for the four/six laning of the NH 66. It has also come to light that no records have been maintained by the state on the age of all the 6,782 trees cut. Of these, in the case of 4,882 trees, no documentation has been carried out about the species, as state records simply state they were ‘firewood trees’, while the rest include jackfruit, coconut, mango and teak varieties. PWD records show that to dispose of the trees after cutting, the state either auctioned the cut wood or recovered the value of the trees from the contractor, depending on what was stipulated in the contract agreement. In all, the state earned a revenue of Rs 17.7 lakh from the felled trees. The Khandepar bridge stretch saw 1,700 trees brought down, which is the second highest number after the Patradevi-Karaswada section, while another 1,225 trees have been felled on the Karaswada-Bambolim stretch of the highway, which passes through Porvorim and Panaji. A total of 425 trees have been cut down for the ambitious Rs 1,400 crore new Zuari bridge project, with its approach roads spanning from Verna to Bambolim, and another 194 trees have been lost along the Dhavali bypass, records indicate. The state government has handed over the project of carrying out compensatory tree plantation to the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation, while some of the work is being carried out in consultation with the forest department. However, the state is yet to come out with details about the areas where the compensatory plantation has been carried out. In March last year, a three-member bench of the Supreme Court had stated that the felling of trees must be kept to the minimal and green cover must be retained as much as possible when constructing large roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/nearly-6-8k-trees-felled-for-ongoing-highway-expansion-across-goa/articleshow/81995690.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

---||Madurai||Tomato falls to Rs 5/kg, may go up if markets are closed||Madurai: The price of tomatoes has dipped to as low as Rs 5 per kg with an increase in supply in the Madurai Central market. It is expected that prices will go up once the government imposes strict restrictions on markets in view of rising Covid-19 cases. P S Murugan, president, Madurai Maatuthavani Central Vegetable market association, is unhappy with the new curbs imposed by the government on retail traders in the wholesale markets. He said that they were receiving 50 to 60 tonnes of tomatoes and hence the price had dropped to as low as Rs 5 per kg. “But, if the government bars around 700 retailers from putting up shops in the market from April 10, they will be affected badly and as a result vegetable prices will go up,” he said.  Murugan said that the best solution would be to allow all the markets to function as usual with strict imposing of the rules, including wearing masks by the buyers and the traders and maintaining social distancing. But, if the government is not willing to allow the retailers to operate at the market, they should give the market association a rental waiver as the small shops pay Rs 1,500 per month, and bigger ones between Rs 4,000 to Rs 7,000 to them, he said. Meanwhile, many farmers, who have cultivated tomatoes this season and had a bountiful harvest, are again affected as the middlemen are buying the tomatoes for less than Re1. Tomatoes are cultivated in Aranmanai Pudur, Karuvelannayakkanpatti, Nagalapuram and other places in Dindigul district. Many of the farmers have decided to not pick the fruit due to the poor price they are fetching. S Manuel Jeyaraj, president of the Paravai wholesale market, said that they had met the district collector T Anbazhagan, who had told them that they would have to comply with the government orders for now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tomato-falls-to-rs-5/kg-may-go-up-if-markets-are-closed/articleshow/81995009.cms||---

The festival will be confined to the temple premises. The Chithirai festival, which goes on for about twenty days, sees a floating population of about 10 lakh devotees from the day Lord Kallazhagar leaves his abode and comes to Madurai. The culminating events of the festival at the temple, including the celestial wedding and coronation, see a large crowd of devotees. Last year, the festival was held without devotees due to the Covid-19 lockdown. The Tamil Nadu government banned the conduct of religious festivals and related events this year too due to a surge in Covid-19 cases. Madurai district collector T Anbazhagan said the festival would be performed by priests within the temple. Arrangements would be made to help devotees view the rituals on the temple website and other platforms. Temple sources said the government allowed political meetings to be held, so it should allow people to at least witness the celestial wedding within the temple with specific rules and regulations in place. The flag is to be hoisted for the festival at the Sri Meenakshi temple on April 15, the celestial wedding would be held on April 24 and the car festival the next day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/this-year-too-chithirai-festival-to-be-held-without-devotees/articleshow/81995005.cms||---

The project, which seeks to engage as many as 35,000 women farmers, comes close on the heels of Balinee Milk Produce Company -- a dairy value chain development project under the UP state rural livelihood mission (UPSRLM) – that covered over 600 villages in Bundelkhand region. Confirming the development, mission director, UPSRLM, Sujit Kumar said that the project could potentially mobilise women and connect them to various initiatives to become economically sustainable. “Women are taking up various economic activities including individual enterprises,” he told TOI. The Balinee company, which has, so far, mobilised over 24,000 women, has supplied 189 lakh kgs of milk till March 2021. Rural development department data show that the peak volume of milk in case of Balinee has to be more than 82,500 Kgs. “A total of Rs 70.86 crore has been paid to the milk producers in the form of milk payment till January 2021 which is about 88% of the company’s turnover,” Kumar said. The rural development department has been seeking to step up women entrepreneurship through various projects under UPSRLM. Kumar said that the department managed to train more than 60,000 women in stitching and were provided work during manufacture of face masks (in the wake of corona pandemic) and school dresses. Further, a special proposal to work on Zari Zardozi has been taken up in Budaun district. “This project is being implemented with an objective of increasing family income of artisans in the district through better price realisation of their products,” he said.

The decision comes soon after the state government kept the implementation of the amended MV Act in abeyance, a move that came within 24 hours of its notification. Godinho said that the Centre will have to bring in an amendment in the Parliament so that states can decide on the extent of fines. “We will give a joint representation to the Union ministry of surface and transport and write to the Prime Minister stating that while this particular decision of imposing fines is towards a noble cause, and is aimed at getting discipline on roads, it can prove counterproductive. How can people pay the fine? People do not have food to eat and are struggling in these pandemic times,” he said. When the new MV Act was implemented in other states, people left their vehicles with the enforcement agencies as they didn’t have money to pay the challan, the transport minister told reporters. “We don’t want such situation in Goa,” Godinho said. He said that the state notified the new MV Act due to the Supreme Court committee. “If I didn’t notify the act, I would have been pulled up,” Godinho said. He said that implementation of the new MV Act has been kept in abeyance due to the bad condition of roads. In view of the request made by state BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade, the chief minister on Thursday said that the government will decide a new date for implementation of the new MV Act. Calling it a “harsh act”, Sawant had said, “The government will take a decision after reviewing it. We have to once again decide on a date to implement it. We will also inform the central government and the Supreme Court.” In order to avoid public outcry ahead of elections, Tanavade had appealed to Sawant and Godinho to keep the implementation in abeyance. “After considering all aspects, we spoke to the chief minister and the transport minister and appealed to them that new MV Act should be kept in abeyance as the fines are very high and common Goans cannot afford them,” Tanavade had said, adding that a decision will be taken within the next two days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/allow-us-to-relax-fines-under-new-mv-act-goa-to-tell-pm/articleshow/81995698.cms||---

With the spike of Covid-19 cases in the city, the Hyderabad Kirana Merchants’ Association had unanimously decided on Thursday to restrict business hours from 9am to 5pm, but few merchants came forward to implement the decision. “It will take at least a couple of days to close all 1,000 shops at Begum Bazar by 5pm,” said president, Hyderabad Kirana Merchants Association, Lakshminarayan Rathi. Over 90% of shops were kept open even after 6pm at the Bazar on Friday. In fact, main roads and even by-lanes at Begum Bazar were packed with goods vehicles and customers. Traffic jams were spotted at several places as is usual in the area. Speaking about why they had not implemented the decision, one shopkeeper said they were completing orders and commitments. “We have taken bulk orders to supply goods from consumers and even firms. These orders were received a few days ahead of the closure decision. We are trying to complete these orders,” said a shopkeeper, who has been selling spices for three decades at Begum Bazar. “We will abide by the association’s decision soon,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/will-take-time-to-shut-all-shops-in-begum-bazar-say-traders/articleshow/81995012.cms||---

According to the minutes of the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) meeting held on April 1, 2021 and uploaded on Friday, SEC asked Dr Reddy’s to submit data on all immunogenicity parametres. It also asked unblinded data of all the serious adverse events as well as comparative analysis of phase III immunogenicity data generated on the Indian and Russian studies at various times. The SEC has sought data pertaining to all immunogenicity parameters, including GMT titres for virus neutralizing antibody and SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein specific antibodies. It has also asked Dr Reddy’s to submit unblinded data of all serious adverse events and RTPCR positive cases along with causality analysis reported till date. Dr Reddy’s has also been asked to submit correlation of immunogenicity data, including cell-based response between phase II & phase III trials as well as comparative analysis of phase III immunogenicity data generated on Indian & Russian studies. Apart from these, it has also told Dr Reddy’s to submit details on the package insert, factsheet, SmPC (summary of product characteristics) including indication, dosage, schedule, contraindications, warning, precautions and storage conditions. Dr Reddy’s had initiated the process for seeking EUA approval for Sputnik V in the third week of February but was first asked to submit data from the Indian leg of the phase II and III trials. In its EUA application Dr Reddy’s had submitted only the safety and immunogenicity data from the phase II Indian study along with the interim safety, efficacy and immunogenicity data from the overseas Phase III trials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sec-seeks-more-data-on-sputnik-from-dr-reddys/articleshow/81995017.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Justice VG Arun extended the interim orders while reserving for pronouncing judgment the petitions filed by P Radhakrishnan, deputy director of ED Kochi zone, challenging the FIRs registered by crime branch wing of Kerala Police. The court said it would try to pronounce the judgment by April 16. Senior advocate Harin Raval, who represented the state government, argued on Friday that the two FIRs are distinct and that they do not relate to the same incident and are not connected. He submitted that the petitions were filed by ED after an additional sessions judge allowed crime branch’s application for recording gold smuggling accused Sandeep Nair’s statement under Section 164 CrPC. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta and additional solicitor general (ASG) SV Raju contended on Friday that neither Swapna Suresh nor Sandeep Nair had alleged that they were coerced by ED when they were presented before the jurisdictional court. That neither Swapna nor Sandeep made a complaint of coercion before the jurisdictional magistrate strikes at the credibility of the FIRs, ASG Raju said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-extends-interim-orders-on-firs-against-ed/articleshow/81995020.cms||---

By just ensuring wearing of masks, social distancing and proper ventilation, risk of Covid-19 spread can be greatly reduced,” said Dr K Kolandasamy, former director of public health, Tamil Nadu. He pointed out that ventilation plays a key role in Covid-19 spread but is not being taken seriously. “Risk of Covid-19 spread is more in a closed room than an open space. Establishments must be monitored if they have proper ventilation and use of air conditioners must be stopped ,” he added. Apart from restrictions, early identification, targeted testing and treatment of Covid-19 patients and containment measures were also emphasized by experts. They said that compared to last year, we are better equipped to fight Covid-19 and this time the impact may not be as severe in Tamil Nadu. “It is important to understand that Covid-19 is here to stay for a few years at least but we can tackle it better if safety precautions are followed. Vaccination must be encouraged ,” said Dr V N Alagavenkatesan, president-elect, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Madurai. The doctor also condemned the move by the Centre to stop vaccination of healthcare providers under the age of 45 years from private sector. “Many healthcare workers, especially nurses are in the age group of 25-30 years. Just when more are coming forward to get vaccinated, it is disappointing that the government chose to stop vaccination for healthcare providers aged less than 45,” he said. As fatigued doctors face a second wave of Covid-19 patients, the IMA is also seeking for some recognition and financial incentive as promised by the state government for all those on Covid duty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/public-cooperation-monitoring-key-for-curbing-rise-in-covid-cases-in-tn-experts/articleshow/81995013.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

Civic officials said they have informed the central health team, which is on a visit to the city, about the constraints being faced by the NMC vis-a-vis manpower. The district authorities, including the municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav, held a meeting with the central team on Thursday. Jadhav said applications are being invited from doctors and nurses, but the response has not been encouraging. “We had issued appointment letters to more than 500 candidates for posts of doctors, lab technicians and nurses, but 346 have not yet joined. We have served them notices, directing them to join immediately or face legal action,” he said. Meanwhile, the two-member central team visited a private medical college and hospital and a Nashik district civil hospital. They later visited a containment zone in the Govindnagar area to review the measures being taken. The team also visited the proposed Covid care centre at Thakker’s dome, which will be operational from Saturday. Covid officer of the Nashik city, Avesh Palod, said the central team has instructed stricter implementation of norms in containment zones and put up boards on steps to be taken during medical urgency or requirement for essential commodities. Bhujbal to open CCC District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal will inaugurate the new 300-bed CCC at Thakker’s dome on Saturday. He will also visit the indoor stadium in Panchavati to review the preparations for the new CCC being set up there. Relief for patient A big private Covid hospital discharged a Covid patient who had failed to pay the bill, following a directive by additional municipal commissioner Suresh Khade. The patient was held back for three days by the hospital. Khade has directed officials to initiate action against the private hospital under the disaster management act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/infra-in-place-but-health-staff-crunch-a-major-issue/articleshow/81995014.cms||Tushar Pawar

UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh said that party workers, who contest against authorised candidates, would be debarred from primary membership of the party for six years. Singh’s stance comes amid his rigorous meetings with party functionaries to chart out aggressive strategies to take on political opponents in the rural local bodies’ elections which are seen as crucial ahead of the high stake UP assembly elections due next year. The UP BJP chief said that the district presidents have been asked to act tough on party workers who are against the party line and contest the panchayat elections against authorised party candidates. “Discipline is of foremost importance in the party,” he said. Singh has summoned the list of such workers who are engaged in anti-party activities and are seeking to contest the panchayat elections. Sources said that a large number of party functionaries have been seeking to contest the rural local bodies’ elections. “The party had scrutinised the candidates at the district level regional before announcing their names,” said a senior BJP leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/former-bjp-mla-ousted-from-party/articleshow/81996651.cms||---
---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu universities yet to evolve online test with invigilation||CHENNAI: Universities in the state are yet to evolve a fool-proof system to properly monitor online exams due to lack of infrastructure and connectivity. Given the second surge in Covid-19 cases, the coming semester exams, partly online, are set to begin in the first week of May. Question papers will be mailed to students who will write them on paper and post answer scripts to colleges. There is no monitoring. In some cases, students are allowed to send answer scripts a day later. Earlier, lack of monitoring and easy question papers inflated pass percentage to above 95% in most universities. Professors say many write exams in groups and form WhatsApp groups to share answers. “Universities and colleges lack infrastructure to conduct online exams. It needs investment to develop software,” a city college principal said. Another principal said around 60% of the college’s students were from rural areas. “It is not possible to monitor them through mobile phone cameras as connections are poor. We have asked them to mail answer scripts after writing in pen and paper mode.” Anna University, Chennai is the only institution to conduct an online test with invigilators and artificial intelligence tools monitoring students. Last semester, the proctored test was successfully taken by more than 90% of students. University of Madras also tried to develop a software and platform for online exams, but many students complained they didn’t internet connectivity. “So, we had to relax the rules,” said vice-chancellor S Gowri. Institutions like Loyola College are conducting exams through available virtual platforms with three layers of monitoring. “There will be an invigilator for every 25 students and a supervisor for every five invigilators. For the entire exam, there will be a central monitoring committee,” said principal Thomas Amirtham. Trichy-based Bharathidasan University is discussing ways to improve monitoring mechanism. “We have learned from from conducting online semester exams last time. We are discussing making minor changes and a decision would be taken in another few days,” said vice-chancellor M Selvam. Some senior academicians propose holding online tests at colleges near students’ residences to avoid malpractices.

Several new attractions, including a garden with 1,300 plants of 22 varities of cacti, have been planned for the area. DDA has been carrying out the ecological restoration of the man-made lake that is located amid 170 acres of greenery, one of the bigger green areas in east Delhi. As part of Phase I of the project, an amphitheatre, a walking trail and cycling tracks have come up. Phase II will cover a much larger area and offer many more attractions like lake view plazas, food courts, observation deck, meditation garden, open gym, play area for children, duck house, artist court, sculpture court, craft hut, etc. The work for the cactus garden will be awarded soon, said officials. It is expected to take around two months’ time and cost around Rs 4.5 lakh. The authority has earlier developed a cactus garden in the district park of Vasant Kunj Sector-B. “Diversity depending on the locality is important and specific parks elicit visitors’ interest,” said Rajeev Kumar Tiwari, DDA’s principal commissioner, horticulture. “In Dwarka, we have planted more than 40 varieties of bougainvillea and on its own, it is very interesting. When water is scarce, bougainvillea requires less water and looks beautiful too. It is the same with cacti, which has so many varieties,” Tiwari said, adding that it will also be a learning experience for DDA’s horticulture department. “Sanjay Lake has one of our bigger parks and this is a way of diversifying and increasing variety,” he said. An official said that while Sanjay Lake has always been a popular location attracting visitors thanks to the presence of the waterbody, greenery and the ducks. However, DDA is now trying to improve the entire area, so that it becomes one of the best recreational areas in the city, specially in east Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dda-plans-round-ii-to-make-e-delhi-lake-recreation-hub/articleshow/81995710.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Lucknow||‘Ensure Covid safety amid wheat purchase’||Lucknow: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday reiterated that strict Covid protocols should be followed during the ongoing wheat procurement exercise. Presiding over a review meeting, the CM stressed that special attention should be given to social distancing and mandatory use of masks at the procurement centres. Yogi’s directions come amid the spike in coronavirus cases in the state. He instructed authorities to ensure the availability of sanitizer, infrared thermometers and pulse oximeters at wheat purchase centres and directed them to run a helpline in connection with wheat procurement for the convenience of farmers. At the same time, he emphasized that the wheat procurement should be done proactively under the minimum support price (MSP) — this year as the state government has raised the MSP to Rs 1,975 per quintal. He laid stress on a transparent arrangement at each purchasing centre. The food and civil supplies department has decided to deploy electronic-point of purchase (e-PoP) machines at the procurement centres where farmers, after getting registered with the department, can sell their produce. The state government has also granted permission to operation of Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) to fast track wheat procurement while allowing the farmers to have a participation in the exercise. Yogi has asked the officials to ensure convenience of the farmers, for which, there should be provisions of sitting, drinking water and shade at the wheat purchase centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ensure-covid-safety-amid-wheat-purchase/articleshow/81996656.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

But Indian manufacturers that have tied up with Russia’s sovereign wealth fund Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), are yet to begin manufacturing the vaccine’s doses. Pharma industry sources say commercial manufacture of Sputnik V in India will begin only after Drugs Controller General of India approves the vaccine. “Everyone is currently producing only test batches of the vaccine for submission. Permission for manufacturing will come only after the EUA approval,” said a top-level official from one of the manufacturers. A top Dr Reddy’s Ltd official had earlier said that there are no Sputnik V doses available in India and that in initial phases the firm will be distributing vaccines imported from Russia. “We don’t have any doses available in India at the moment. We are in discussions with a couple of players to tie up adequate quantities (for manufacturing) so that with EUA coming in, the amount of vaccines coming into the country...plus the amount of vaccines that will be produced within India can be synchronised to build up overall stocks,” Deepak Sapra, CEO, API & Pharmaceutical Services, Dr Reddy’s, said in January.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sputnik-v-manufacturing-in-india-to-begin-after-eua-nod/articleshow/81995019.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

The protesting taxi drivers have been staging a dharna at the Azad Maidan demanding that GoaMiles be scrapped.

The court made the relief conditional on him joining the police investigation. Justice Mukta Gupta also issued notice and sought responses of Delhi Police and the complainant woman on the journalist’s plea seeking anticipatory bail in the case. “Petitioner be not arrested till the next date of hearing subject to him joining the investigation as and when directed,” the high court said while asking police to verify the documents that the accused will furnish and also to file a status report by April 16. The accused moved HC after his earlier anticipatory bail plea was dismissed by a trial court on March 12. In her complaint the 22-year-old woman alleged that she was raped by the accused at a five-star hotel in Chanakyapuri on February 20. However, the counsel for the accused maintained that there is a history of previous sexual relationship between the accused and the complainant. When the woman’s lawyer urged the court not to grant any protection to the accused since he has been on the run for the last 50 days, the high court said if the man has documents to show that the relationship was consensual, let him join the investigation and police will verify it. The trial court, while rejecting the journalist’s anticipatory bail plea, had said that consent cannot be implied from the complainant’s previous experiences with the accused and if the woman stated in her evidence before the court that she did not consent, the court shall presume that she did not.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/high-court-grants-arrest-relief-to-journalist-accused-in-rape-case/articleshow/81995749.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi: Occupancy rate stays low in govt hospitals||NEW DELHI: The capital recorded its second-highest single-day tally of Covid-19 with 8,521 more people testing positive on Friday.  This is just 72 short of the highest single-day figure of 8,593 cases reported on November 11, 2020. The total cases have reached 7,06,526, while the death toll has hit 11,196 with 39 fresh fatalities. In the past 24 hours, 1,09,398 tests (70,403 RT-PCR and 38,995 Rapid Antigen Tests) were conducted, the highest till date. The positivity rate was 7.79%. Health department officials said the cases have increased at an alarming rate over the last three weeks. “Earlier, it was thought that the disease was milder this time. But the situation in hospitals and deaths being reported daily suggest otherwise. Government agencies are scaling up infrastructure for testing, tracking and treatment of patients. All hospitals have been asked to increase their bed capacity and pull together resources to manage the crisis,” said an official. Delhi has 10,832 beds reserved for Covid-19 patients. Of them, 5,097 (47%) are occupied. Most patients with mild symptoms are under home isolation and only those with moderate to severe symptoms are being admitted to hospitals. Therefore, the demand is higher for ICU beds with and without ventilators. The occupancy rate for both stands at 63% and 60%, respectively. Like last year, the occupancy is lower in government hospitals, while big private hospitals like Apollo, Max, Fortis, BLK and Manipal barely have any ICU beds left. Max and Fortis hospitals in Shalimar Bagh have no beds available at all. Kalra Hospital in Kirti Nagar, Saroj Super Specialty Hospital in Rohini, Ayushman Hospital in Dwarka, National Heart Institute in East of Kailash and Sanjeevani Hospital in Daryaganj are other facilities with no vacancies. Many patients are being forced to run from one hospital to another for admission, a scenario witnessed in November 2020 when the daily cases had crossed the 8,000 mark. “My wife and 72-year-old mother are both Covid-positive. As none of the big private hospitals in my neighbourhood have beds available, we are shifting them to Lok Nayak Hospital,” said Neha Kumari, a resident of Shalimar Bagh. A similar crisis seems to be emerging again, though at a much greater speed. “In February first week, 130-140 cases were being reported daily. It seemed that the pandemic had slowed down. But there has been an exponential rise in cases over the past few weeks. Strict adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour and creating micro-containment zones is needed to limit the disease spread,” said a senior doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/occupancy-rate-stays-low-in-govt-hospitals/articleshow/81995787.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Kochi||No religion has unrestricted right, rules HC||Kochi: No religious community has an unrestricted right to conduct pilgrimage to a place within a forest reserve, the Kerala High Court said. After considering petitions related to the right of Christians to install crosses, construct ‘Althara’, or conduct pilgrimage to Karcichattimotta near Bonacaud in Thiruvananthapuram, which is described by Christians as ‘Kurishumala’, Justice N Nagaresh said in the judgment, “No religious community has an unbridled right to conduct pilgrimage to any place inside a Reserve Forest land. If any group of people forcibly enter any Reserve Forest Area and construct any authorized structures, such structures are liable to be removed by the Forest Authorities in accordance with law.” The court said the forest range officer’s decision should be enforced. Noting the contention of Christhudas, vicar general of Neyyattinkara Latin Diocese, that a consensus was reached with the state government regarding installation of Holy Cross at ‘Kurishumala’, the court has permitted him to follow up with the government or pursue legal proceedings. The claim that believers have a right to pilgrimage to the hilltop is seriously disputed by the forest department. When a right is disputed by the authorities, the right should be established through appropriate legal proceedings, the court said while holding that the high court cannot adjudicate a disputed question of fact. While deciding on the right of religious communities to conduct pilgrimage within forests, the court referred to a 2018 decision (WA No. 374/2018) by a division bench regarding Agastyarkoodam. The division bench had held that allowing elaborate poojas and ‘radhayatra’ in the restricted area would ruin the ecology and the biodiversity that are required to be preserved at any cost. It would also allow commercial exploitation of the idol that is within the forest land, the court had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/no-religion-has-unrestricted-right-rules-hc/articleshow/81995024.cms||---

A division bench comprising Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly also asked the state government to take over lands agreed to be surrendered for widening of roads. The court considered a batch of petitions seeking steps to ensure road safety and for a court directive to hand over funds raised by the government for this purpose to the road safety authority. Stating that safe roads are part of a citizen’s rights, the court said central and state governments should take action to provide safe roads without fail. Pillars and similar structures that pose danger to road users should be removed and vehicles and solid waste dumped by the roads should be cleared, the court directed. Branches of trees on lands adjacent to roads that extend to the road surface should be cut away, the court added. In its order, the court also directed the state government to issue notice and take appropriate action to take over lands whose owners are not willing to surrender their lands for widening of roads. The court also called for a mechanism whereby repairs on road surfaces are completed in a joint manner so as to prevent repeated digging up of roads for repair works. Towards enhancing road safety, the court said strict action should be taken against those who do not obey rules and regulations. Road safety authority should intervene to provide necessary help to accident victims, the court directed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/action-required-on-war-footing-says-high-court/articleshow/81995043.cms||---

Preceding with the appeal by the national president of the party to party workers to assemble and mingle with the Dalit population and celebrate Ambedkar Jayanti on April 14 as Dalit Diwali by lighting lamp at statues and portraits of Ambedkar, Akhilesh had strategically worked to induct prominent BSP leaders, including Indrajeet Saroj, Balihari Babu and Dayaram Pal, in the party fold. Last month, Akhilesh had gone to Varanasi to join Saint Ravidas anniversary celebrations and offered prayers at the famous Ravidas temple. Akhilesh had also offered prayers at the temple of Mata Sair Devi on the banks of Yamuna in Tundla district, who is highly worshipped and revered by the Nishad community. During his ‘bicyle yatra’ in the run up to 2012 assembly elections, Akhilesh had visited this temple to seek the devi’s blessings. He felt that as he had succeeded in forming the government in the state then the same would happen in 2022 elections. With the assembly elections drawing closer, the SP chief has been working on his plan to woo the dalits and the MBCs to expand the party’s base beyond the traditional MY (Muslim, Yadav) votes. His alliance with the BSP in 2019 general elections was also his bid to end the Dalits’ hostilities towards his party, though the alliance did not last long and BSP chief Maywati unilaterally broke away from it. The Samajwadi Party feels that by working among the dalits the party would be able to blunt the BJP’s campaign of ‘dalit khichdi’, ‘Samrasta Diwas’ and other such programmes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhilesh-asks-sp-workers-to-celebrate-dalit-diwali/articleshow/81996687.cms||Subhash Mishra
---||Coimbatore||42 clusters identified in dist for sero survey||Coimbatore: The state government-ordered second sero survey to check for the presence of antibodies among the residents of Covid-19 clusters has begun in the district, which logged 473 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Friday, taking the tally past the 62,000-mark to 62,070. With only 142 people getting discharged from treatment centres, the number of active cases has increased to 3,389. The Covid-19 tally, meanwhile, rose to 699, with one more patient succumbing to the virus. For the sero survey, at least 42 clusters have been identified in the district and teams, each comprising four members, from every block have started collecting 20-odd blood samples from each cluster. Each team will have a lab technician, village or urban health nurse, medical officer and health inspector. “Most of the teams are collecting more than 20 samples per cluster, because some will get contaminated or will not be usable,” an official said. Officials have collected 90 samples from three clusters in the district so far. The samples would be run through the chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) machine. This sero survey is crucial, because it will assess whether the population with antibodies has jumped nearly three months after the vaccination drive began. More than 2.16 lakh people have taken at least the first dose of the vaccine. The sero survey in October last had found antibodies in 21.94% people, while the ICMR’s survey in December had found antibodies in 10% people. Block level officers have been visiting the clusters since Thursday evening to collect blood samples for the sero survery. This is the second time they are conducting the survey to check the extent of population with antibodies to Covid-19. Samples from Coimbatore, Nilgiris, Erode, Tirupur and Namakkal would be run in the district. Among the 42 clusters in the district are Selvapuram, Peelamedu, Saravanampatti, Ramanathapuram and Madukkarai. Tirupur and Erode have 27 and 26 clusters, respectively. Officials said they were presently running the samples from Tirupur, which has sent samples from 23 of the 27 clusters. “We have also received samples from three clusters each in Erode and Coimbatore,” said the microbiologist, who is incharge of the sero survey lab. Another official said no deadline has been fixed so far for collecting and running the samples.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/42-clusters-identified-in-dist-for-sero-survey/articleshow/81995798.cms||---

The incident that went on for two hours was reported on Thursday night from the Chetla crossing near the residence of former mayor and state minister Firhad Hakim. BJP candidate Rudranil Ghosh has lodged a complaint with police, claiming that he was injured in the clash. The south division police arrested four persons, including a youth leader of Ward 82, in connection with the incident. According to the complaint, Ghosh had completed canvassing in the Shaktinagar slum area as part of his door-to-door campaign. BJP supporters alleged that TMC workers had attacked them multiple times — first they threatened the BJP supporters in the area, stopped them from canvassing and finally assaulted them while they were on the way to the Chetla police station to lodge a complaint. Later, Ghosh took to Facebook and claimed that he had suffered injuries along with at least 15 of his supporters. “They came armed with pistols, wickets and sticks and attacked us. They even threatened our women supporters with rape,” said the actor-turned-politician, claiming that at least 200-250 Trinamool-backed goons were involved in the attack. Several media persons too were reportedly attacked in the melee, said police. “The case is being investigated from all angles and we have collected CCTV footage from the area. The incident started with the allegations of posters and flexes being damaged by a political party,” said a police officer. Trinamool, however, denied the allegations against the party. Hakim claimed that some outsiders were trying to create violence in the area. “There are no BJP supporters in this area,” he said. Denouncing the attack on media persons, he said that all involved with the attack would face legal action. Later in the evening, Dhritiman Sarkar, a DC ranking officer was posted in charge of Kasba police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/four-arrested-after-2-hour-tmc-bjp-clash-in-chetla/articleshow/81995058.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Goa||ATK Mohun Bagan pay record transfer fee to sign Liston||Panaji: ATK Mohun Bagan have agreed a record fee with Hyderabad FC for the transfer of Liston Colaco. The 22-year-old winger is among the more talented players in Indian football and had a year left on his existing contract with Hyderabad. Immediately after conclusion of the Indian Super League, ATK Mohun Bagan chased Colaco relentlessly but Hyderabad stood firm. Two big offers were first rejected, and the club decided to release the youngster only when they were assured of a record transfer fee. “With a focus on long-term sustainability, Hyderabad FC agreed for Liston’s move in a deal that fetches the highest-ever transfer fee received for an Indian player,” the club said in a statement on Saturday. According to sources, the transfer fee is close to Rs 1 crore, more than the Rs 90 lakh ATK paid to fulfil Michael Soosairaj’s buy-out clause and get him released from Jamshedpur FC in 2019. Interestingly, while Colaco plays across many positions upfront, his preferred role is on left wing from where he loves cutting in. It’s the same position Soosairaj is most comfortable and both are now left to possibly fight for that spot. Should Colaco move to the right, he’ll have to compete with Manvir Singh, one of the club’s success stories this season. Ever since his days with Salgaocar FC in the Goa Professional League – where he finished as the top scorer at age 19 – Colaco has been billed as the best young player to emerge from the state in recent times. FC Goa spent Rs 10 lakh as transfer fee in 2017 to sign Colaco from Salgaocar but the youngster did not get enough playing time. Before the end of his three-year contract, he was then allowed to join Hyderabad on a free transfer during the January window. Colaco got a few games during the club’s debut season (2019-20) in ISL when they finished last. It was only under Manuel Marquez that he showed his true potential at Hyderabad this year with two goals and three assists. His best ‘show’ was against East Bengal at the Tilak Maidan in Vasco. The most noteworthy moment was when he sent East Bengal’s experienced full back Scott Neville the wrong way, before releasing a diagonal ball for Halicharan Narzary to score. The winger made his international debut last month against the United Arab Emirates (UAE) at the Zabeel Stadium in Dubai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/atk-mohun-bagan-pay-record-transfer-fee-to-sign-liston/articleshow/82009722.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Kochi||Fishermen’s murder: Italy to pay Rs 10 crore relief||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday decided to take over disbursal of the Rs 10 crore compensation to be paid by Italy as compensation to the kin of two Kerala fishermen, who were shot dead in February 2012 by two Italian Marines aboard the ship ‘Enrica Lexie’, in lieu of closure of criminal cases against its two Navy personnel in India. Italy, through senior advocate Suhail Dutt, informed a bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian that after prolonged negotiations with the Indian government, based on the May 21, 2020, award of the arbitral tribunal under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), it was ready to pay Rs 10 crore compensation to the kin of the dead fishermen as well as the owner of the boat, which was damaged in the firing. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta gave credit to the Union government for driving a hard bargain to make Italy agree for Rs 10 crore compensation over and above the amount already paid by the Italian government to the kin of the deceased as well as the boat owner. “Indians are the best negotiators when it comes to money. The families of the victims have agreed to receive the determined compensation amount,” Mehta said as he informed the court that the ministry of external affairs would on Friday itself provide the bank account details to Italy for depositing the amount. Kerala government, through senior advocate Jaideep Gupta, said the trial against the Marines should not be closed till the money was deposited in the SC registry. “Money should be deposited in the Supreme Court, otherwise the families of the victims have no recourse to remedy,” he added. The SG agreed with the Kerala government. The CJI-led bench ordered, “We direct that after the amount is received by the Union of India (from the Italian government), the same shall be deposited in this court within a period of one week. You (Union government) deposit the money in the SC. We will disburse it.” The SG said it would be deposited within three days of the Centre receiving it. Surprised by the Centre’s promptness in the case, the CJI told the SG, “We would like you to act with the same speed in other regular matters. When other matters come up for hearing, the government generally finds two weeks’ time given by the court for response inadequate and seeks more time.” The SG promised prompter action in other cases too but added, “It depends which ministry is involved in the case.” The bench posted the matter for further hearing on April 19. Appearing for other crew members who were on the boat ‘St Antony’ when it was fired upon by the Marines who allegedly mistook them for pirates, advocate C Unnikrishnan told the bench that the Rs 10 crore was meant only for the kin of the two deceased fishermen and the boat owner. He said the arbitral tribunal award covered compensations to other crew members but they had not been taken into account by the Italian and Indian governments. The MEA had accepted the May 21 award of the UNCLOS arbitral tribunal saying it vindicated India’s stand by ruling that “actions of the Italian Marines (Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone on board Italian vessel Enrica Lexie) breached India’s freedom and right of navigation” and upheld the conduct of Indian authorities with regard to the February 15, 2012, incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/deposit-rs-10-crore-for-compensation-sc-tells-centre/articleshow/81995059.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Jaipur||Congress flies in 18 Assam poll alliance candidates to Jaipur||GUWAHATI/JAIPUR: Fearing horse trading, Congress on Friday morning flew out 18 of the 19 candidates of AIUDF, its ally in the 'mahajot' in Assam, to a hotel on the outskirts of Jaipur, three weeks ahead of the results. However, AIUDF president and Badruddin Ajmal’s millionaire brother, Sirajuddin, has not joined the group. The three-phase election in Assam got over on April 6. The Congress had forged the 'mahajot' or the 'grand alliance', a 10 party coalition consisting of the AIUDF, Jimochayan (Deori) People's Party (JDPP), Adivasi National Party (ANP), CPM, CPI, CPI (ML), Anchalik Gana Morcha, Bodoland People's Party (BPF) and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), to take on the BJP in Assam. The 'mahajot’ ally, the BPF led by Hagrama Mohilary, also shifted all its 11 candidates to a hotel in Kokrajhar, also fearing horse trading. The AIUDF MLAs were accompanied by AICC secretary and co-in-charge of Assam, Prithiviraj Sathe, in the flight from Guwahati to Jaipur. Congress sources in Jaipur said that at least 22 candidates have reached the city by flight and have been taken to Fairmont Hotel on the outskirts of Jaipur. However, how long they will stay in Jaipur is not known as the counting is scheduled on May 2. The candidates include those from AIUDF, BPF and the Left, sources said. They have been kept in the same hotel in the capital where Congress MLAs of Rajasthan had holed up last July during an internal crisis. "Several AIUDF candidates who contested Assam assembly polls have been shifted to Jaipur today. A few more Congress candidates will be shifted to Jaipur shortly and arrangements have been made at Fairmont Hotel," agencies reported quoting sources in the Congress. "It's a precautionary measure taken up by the 'mahajot' alliance," sources further said. The alliance's decision to shift the candidates comes within days of Congress-ally BPF candidate from Tamulpur, Rangja Khungur Basumatary, joining the BJP ahead of the third phase of poll in Assam. The Congress then asked EC to postpone poll in Tamulpur, but the poll body refused to do so. The Congress-AIUDF move comes in the wake of several incidents in the past where the grand old party has lost majority in states because of its MLAs deciding to either resign or switch over to the BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/congress-flies-in-18assam-poll-alliance-candidates-to-jaipur/articleshow/81995799.cms||Prabin Kalita
---||Amritsar||Another girl in Pakistan abducted, converted||AMRITSAR: The spate in incidents of alleged abduction of Hindu girls in Pakistan, their conversion and marriage, has led to the demand for a committee to decide whether the conversion took place by will or was forced. The latest case in the series is the alleged abduction and conversion of Aarti Devi of Larkana. Meanwhile, the parliamentary committee to protect minorities from forced conversion has failed to form a law to protect minority community girls from involuntary conversion. Talking to the Times of India on Friday, Pakistan Muslim League (N), member National Assembly (MNA) Kheal Das Kohistani said the Hindu community in Pakistan is distraught at the series of kidnapping and forced conversions. He said Aarti Devi was allegedly abducted by a man named Fawad, who converted her to Islam and renamed her Ayesha. “The worst part is that in majority of cases, police remain a mute spectator and doesn’t do anything beyond arraigning the hapless girls in court. In this case, even Aarti Devi’s family members were not allowed to meet her today,” he said. In 2019, a parliamentary committee to protect minorities from forced conversions, headed by senator Anwarul Haq Kakar was constituted but so far, it has not been able to form any law to protect girls from the minority community. PML(N) MNA Kheal Das said the committee was conducting meetings with all stakeholders across Pakistan and was in the process of finalising the Bill which would become law to give much-needed relief to minorities in Pakistan. Condemning the incident, All Pakistan Hindu Panchayat, on its Facebook page, suggested formation of a committee comprising of retired judges, as well as known Hindu leaders to decide whether the conversion of minority girls was by force or by will.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/another-girl-in-pak-abducted-converted/articleshow/81995063.cms||---

Mild infection was detected in the heart too. Surgeons who conducted the autopsy in Konni on Friday feel that the infection may be due to aerobic bacteria and suspect the presence of clostridium bacteria. Samples have been sent to the state institute of animal diseases, Palode.

Ahead of the weekend lockdown, markets were flooded with people purchasing essential articles including vegetables and daily need articles. Even fuel stations will sell petrol and diesel to those belonging to defined essential services only. Auragabad district collector Sunil Chavan reiterated that there was no need to rush in the markets, as all the essential services, including standalone grocery stores, milk centers, pharmacy stores and similar services have been granted exemption. “By stepping out of home in violation of covid-19 norms, people are adding to the number of cases,” said Chavan while appealing people to step out only when necessary. On Friday, a large number of traders gathered in front of Beed district collector’s office and shouted slogans demanding withdrawal of the restrictions. While the traders from Nanded, Hingoli, Parbhani, Jalna and Aurangabad have come out in open threatening to launch an agitation against the imposed restrictions.

But the fact is there are already very serious questions about the viability of minibuses due to rising diesel cost. If one computes the fee, interests on loans and the profitability, the new buses would not be viable to operate,” they claimed. “It is clear that the new policy of giving new permits to unemployed youths is more of a propaganda for polls, but it would not help the unemployed youths in actual and they can even land in debt traps,” Soeta and Gardiwal said. The action committee leaders said the Punjab chief minister should call a meeting of minibus operators to know the ground reality instead of leaving them in the lurch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/minibus-operators-in-the-lurch-3000-buses-off-road/articleshow/81995060.cms||IP Singh
---||Delhi||No FCI counter at Narela mandi to buy foodgrains at MSP, says Rai||New Delhi: Agriculture minister for the capital Gopal Rai on Friday visited the Narela Mandi and said he couldn’t find a single counter of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) for buying foodgrains at minimum support price (MSP). FCI countered that counters at its food storage depot (FSD) are just a few metres from the main gate of Narela Mandi. Rai had alleged on Wednesday that FCI, a statutory body under Union ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution, has not set up a single counter fto buy grains in the city and is making false claims of purchasing wheat at MSP rates from April 1. The claims were refuted by FCI. On Friday, Rai inspected the mandi. “For the past few days, we’ve been getting several complaints from farmers that FCI has not been procuring foodgrains at MSP rates at Narela,” he said. “Yesterday (Thursday), when we asked for a report, we discovered that FCI did not even set up a counter. Yet, the body still claims it is making purchases,” he said. “When I asked FCI officers the reason, they said that the farmers are yet to submit land revenue records,” he said. “If grains are being purchased in mandis all over India, then what is the issue in Delhi?” In a statement, FCI reiterated that its purchase centres at Najafgarh, Narela and Mayapuri have been functional since April 1. It claimed that its Narela depot is adjacent to APMC Narela mandi. The Union body further said it has procured 158 quintals of wheat at MSP from three farmers at FSD Narela on April 6 and released Rs 3.1 lakh directly into the bank accounts of farmers. It said there is no state government agency to monitor and speed up the procurement process and requested Delhi government to appoint one. “A meeting was convened at the FCI regional office, with joint director (Agriculture). Due to non-implementation of online procurement portal, it was decided the procurement will be carried out on the basis of submission of physical documents,” the statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-fci-counter-at-narela-mandi-to-buy-foodgrains-at-msp-says-rai/articleshow/81997270.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Chandigarh||Pvt transporters vie for passengers||Bathinda: The conductor making announcements at Bathinda bus stand catches passengers’ attention saying a woman can travel free with two persons. At times, he shouts, “2 ke saath 1 free.” Already, private transporters are feeling the pinch of Punjab government’s ambitious plan of providing free travel facility to women in state-owned buses. The passenger intake in private buses is stated to have reduced while state-owned buses are said to be getting more passengers than they can accommodate. This despite the fact that state-owned buses do not even ply on some of the routes. A private transport company Guru Nanak Travels (GNT) on Thursday launched the offer of free travel for women accompanied by two passengers with paid tickets. GNT representative Gurmeet Singh said, “The 35 buses of our transport company run on various routes in the state. From April 1, when state government provided free travel facility for women, we have been getting much less travellers. Even if someone is with a woman traveller, she takes him along in a state-owned bus and we fail to even get male passengers. Earlier, transporters had to face lockdown, then hike in petrol and diesel prices and now the government’s sop, which will throw us out of business. Hoping to get some business back, we have offered one woman free travel with two others who purchase tickets.” Other transporters said they would have to follow suit. Convener, Malwa zone private bus operators’ union, Baltej Singh said the free travel facility for women is akin to ruining private transporters. “We are getting much less passengers than before April 1, when the scheme was not started.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pvt-transporters-vie-for-passengers/articleshow/81995061.cms||Neel Kamal

Apart from the duo, the probe agency also recorded the statement of deputy commissioner of police Raju Bhujbal and questioned Singh and suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Waze again on Friday. Shinde was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the Mansukh Hiran murder case. Waze has been in custody since March 13. The CBI on Friday sought the diary and documents that were seized from the accused by the NIA in their case. The bar owner, Mahesh Shetty, is likely to be a crucial witness in the case as his name was found mentioned in a diary recovered from Waze, a source said. Singh’s allegations specifically mention a Rs 100 crore per month extortion “target” by Deshmukh from bars and restaurants in Mumbai. After recording Shetty’s statement, the CBI officers again briefly questioned Waze on Friday evening as they wanted clarification on some information furnished by Shetty, sources said. On Thursday, the CBI had questioned Mumbai police ACP Sanjay Patil, who was cited as a potential witness by Singh. Singh has mentioned WhatsApp chats with Patil where he purportedly refers to Deshmukh’s insistence that Mumbai police raise Rs 100 crore for him by extorting money from bars and restaurants in the city. Within four days of registering a preliminary enquiry in connection with the high court order to investigate Singh’s allegations, the CBI is learnt to have questioned and recorded the statements of at least five people till Friday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cbi-quizzes-bar-owner-from-borivli-named-in-waze-diary/articleshow/81996789.cms||Raj Shekhar

Acting on the directions of enforcement director (mining) R N Dhoke, Khanna police arrested Gurinder Singh alias Ginda of Bhorla village in Samrala and seized four illegal country-made weapons, ammunition and a Maruti Swift Dzire car with a Delhi registration number from him. Dhoke said they had received a tip-off about some persons involved in illegal mining in Rahon area of Nawanshahr district, following which the information was shared with SSP Khanna, Gursharandeep Singh Grewal.

---||Lucknow||Rs 4,200-cr memorial scam: 4 UPRNN officials arrested||The vigilance establishment of Uttar Pradesh Police on Friday arrested four officials of UP Rajkiya Nirman Nigam (UPRNN) in connection with Rs 4,200-crore scam involving construction of memorials in Lucknow and Noida between 2007 and 2012 during the BSP regime. Those arrested have been identified as (then) financial consultant Vimal Kant, general manager (technical) SK Tyagi, GM Krishna Kumar and Kameshwar Sharma. All have been arrested under the charges of prevention of corruption act, and criminal breach of trust by public servants. A formal investigation into the memorial scam began in 2013 after the Lokayukta in its probe indicted 199 persons, including the then BSP ministers Naseemuddin Siddiqui and Babu Singh Kushwaha, and also 12 BSP MLAs. Thereafter, a formal investigation was launched by the vigilance establishment. Sources privy to the probe disclosed that high prices were levied for the stones used in the memorials and parks constructed in Lucknow and Noida during between 2007 and 2012 by the accused engineers. Stones were quarried from Mirzapur putting into service 29 machines but it was shown in the papers that the stones were taken to Rajasthan and there the designs were carved out, thus inflating the cost by several times. A consortium was also formed which was against mining rules. The accused engineers arbitrarily contacted stone suppliers and took a hefty commission. It was also revealed in the investigation that the officers were arbitrarily authorized to fix the price. The leasing was started after fixing a higher price. The firm of the financial consultant Vimal Kant's brother was arbitrarily handed over crores of rupees. Sources in the vigilance establishment said that in all, 199 persons were indicted in the memorial scam of which 65 were government officers and others were non-government persons. All 65 have retired. "We have got prosecution sanction against 18 goverment officials while a litigation procedure is under way against 47 others," they said. The action is a continuous process of the agency to chargesheet all the accused persons against whom the government has given the prosecution sanction and there is no stay order from the high court. The vigilance establishment had filed first chargesheet in memorial scam last year in October 2020, then it had named six persons identified -- geology and mining department joint director Suhail Ahmad Farooqui, then UPRNN unit in charge Ajay Kumar, consortium head Pannalal Yadav, Ashok Singh and Hoshiyar Singh. The ED had also registered a case of PMLA in the scam and had raided the premises of six engineers and contractors in Lucknow. The ED is simultaneously conducting a probe into the sale and purchase of sandstone and marbles done by engineers and contractors by laundering public money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rs-4200-cr-memorial-scam-4-uprnn-officials-arrested/articleshow/81996790.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Rly ready to offer coaches for Covid patients but NMC lacks manpower||Nagpur: With the second wave of Covid-19 at its peak, the Nagpur division of Central Railway is ready to offer its modified coaches as quarantine facility if needed by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) or district administration. Divisional railway manager (DRM) Richa Khare told reporters on Friday, “During the first wave, as per Railway Board directions we had modified 60 coaches as quarantine facility. Thirty of them were remodeled after the Covid-19 wave subsidized last year. We still have 30 coaches remaining including 12 in Nagpur, 13 in Wardha, and five in Amla.” Central Railway employees too have been hit, she said. Though 7,500 employees have been vaccinated, there are 650 Covid-19 active cases in the division. Twenty in service and 27 retired employees in the division had died due to the coronavirus. Due to lack of O2 beds at railway hospital, railway employees have to take treatment at government or private hospitals, she said. On utilization of Central Railway Hospital for all Covid-19 patients, the Khare said, “It will be a difficult option as thousands of existing employees and retired staff from both SECR and Central Railway avail medical facility here from the entire division spread out in MP and Nagpur. We have already spared eight doctors and 16 paramedical staff for Covid care at NMC hospitals.” Divisional commissioner Dr Sanjeev Kumar was unavailable for comments. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said, “There is no issue in taking over railway facility but our problem is of manpower. We arranged teams for Pachpaoli centre today. We will certainly consider the suggestion in future.” On plan to keep a tab on positive cases by asking for an RT-PCR test certificate from passengers, senior DCM Krishnath Patil said, “We are following the state protocol which doesn’t mandate us to seek an RT-PCR report. We are doing thermal scanning of passengers.” On the achievements of the division, Khare said, “Despite Covid, the division generated Rs 2,865 crore revenue in 2020-21. The earnings are less than last financial year’s due to deficit in passenger earnings. Total originating loading of 33.50 million tonnes was achieved against 34.06 million tonnes last year in spite of a shortfall of 2.86 million tonnes (MT) in the first four months due to Covid-19. We carried 52% of load of entire Central Railways.” For the current year, Khare said, “The loading target for 2021-22 is 37 MT. If all goes well, total coal loading @22.4 rakes per day will give 32.7 MT this year. Washed coal loading which was discontinued since 2012-13 has resumed. Besides, loading from Karnataka-Emta also resumed in March. These will give additional two rakes a day. Presuming the impact of Covid during first four months of 2020-21 does not happen into 2021-22, the loading for other commodities is expected to be 4.28 MT.” The DRM said the division earned non-fare revenue (NFR) of Rs 79.65 lakh despite pandemic. “We also increased operational efficiency by improving the speed of freight trains by 89.6% from 21.2 kmph last year to 40.2 kmph. The highest ever speed of freight trains 50.6 kmph was achieved in March beating the previous best of 45.7 kmph,” she added.

---||Kolkata||Candidates take ‘development’ credit to woo Uttarpara voters||Kolkata: Barely 17km from Esplanade, Uttarpara that goes to polls on Saturday sees all three parties vying with each other to take the credit of “development” in the town, one of the fast growing residential-cum-commercial hubs in Hooghly. While Trinamool Congress bags credit for well-maintained roads, cleaner colonies and giving a new lease of life to Hind Motor where a data centre park is going to come up in the future, BJP — whose candidate is the current MLA, Prabir Ghoshal, who had defected from TMC, — claims credit for the Metro connectivity and overall development. The CPM claimed that TMC had reaped the benefits of the groundwork on developmental activities during their tenure between 1951 and 2011 with only a two-year gap in between. Uttarpara Assembly segment comprises two civic bodies —Uttarpara Kotrung Municipality and Konnagar Municipality — along with Kanaipur, Nabagram and Raghunathpur gram panchayats, all of which fall under Serampore Parliamentary constituency in Hooghly. “I am the main architect of all developmental activities in this area, which has undergone a massive development during my tenure in the last five years,” said Ghoshal. Actor Kanchan Mullick, the TMC candidate, admitted that it is going to be a tough fight this time and said he has been banking on the “highly educated” mass in the area. The CPM candidate, Rajat Banerjee, said, “Both TMC and BJP have been suffering from factional feud here. I am going to win here this time and bring back the Left era.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/candidates-take-development-credit-to-woo-uttarpara-voters/articleshow/81995080.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Coimbatore||5L women stayed away from voting in dist||Roughly five lakh women in the district have abstained from voting in the just concluded assembly election. It is perhaps the highest number of women staying away from exercising their right to franchise in an assembly election in the district in the recent past. Since they form a larger voting population than men in the district, women absentee voters have also outnumbered their male counterparts, who did not exercise their franchise this time. While about 31% of the total male voters hadn’t turned out to vote, about 32.5% of the total women voters hadn’t exercised their franchise in the district. An AIADMK functionary, who didn’t want to be named, said, “We are also wondering why so many women preferred not to vote. In fact, male voter turnout was also very low in certain constituencies. But female voter turnout was even more less.’’ At the state level, the turnout of women voters was interestingly much higher than that in Coimbatore. When the district recorded a female voter turnout of 67.5%, the state average was 72.5%. In some districts, the women voters had turned up in large numbers. In Coimbatore, Sulur constituency recorded the highest number of women voters at 74.5%, while Coimbatore North segment had the lowest number of female voters at 58.6%. The number was more or less in tune with the turnout of male voters. A cross section of women voters said they preferred not to vote primarily because of concerns about Covid-19. Some, however, said they were usually not in the habit of voting in any elections. “I had voted in the 2019 elections. But this time I could not make it because of rising Covid cases,” said Sripriya Parameswaran, a 67-year-old resident of Singanallur. However, political parties are surprised at the poor turnout of women voters, despite several announcements to woo them. The AIADMK had promised Rs1,500 per month for every household, 50% discount in bus fare for women, free washing machines and six free LPG cylinders for a year. Its rival, the DMK, had promised Rs1,000 for every housewife holding a ration card, free travel in city buses and increase in maternity benefits. “These promises may not show an immediate result, but in the long run would draw women to the polling booths. In fact, it was after self-help groups were formed, there was a surge in women voting,” said a former DMK MLA, requesting anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/5l-women-stayed-away-from-voting-in-dist/articleshow/81995869.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

To win the trust of Sukhwinder Singh, 45, the accused took him to the embassy and showed him three cars.Sahnewal police have registered a case against the four: Avinash Bhatti of Isa Nagri, Ankush Kumar Malik of Dugri, Abhishek of Ajit Singh Nagar and Rinku Bawa, also of Ludhiana. Sukhwinder, of Bajra village, said, “Ankush is a broker in second-hand car business. He had earlier helped me sell two cars. In 2019, Ankush told me about the three cars of Embassy of Russia. He said those were in good condition and available for sale.” Sukhwinder told Ankush that he would check the cars before finalizing the deal. “Ankush took me to the embassy in Delhi, where Rinku, Avinash and Abhishek were present. I knew Rinku, as he too is a second-hand car dealer. After seeing the three cars, I gave Rs 50,000 to the accused to fix the deal,” he added. It was decided that Sukhwinder will have to make full payment of another Rs 7.50 lakh before the delivery of the cars. “After a few days, I arranged the money and handed it over to Ankush. But I did not get the cars,” he said. On July 21, 2020, Sukhwinder lodged a complaint against the accused. An inquiry was marked to an ACP-ranked official. Sub-inspector Pooran Singh said, “A case has been registered under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) of the IPC. Sukhwinder had made the payment in cash. He fell into the trap as he was taken to the embassy, where the accused acted as if they had sold a car to a man present there. Besides, the cars parked outside the embassy had no link with the embassy officials.

Officials of the Periyar Tiger Reserve are calling the female tiger cub Mangala, a name inspired by the location she was found abandoned in. AP Sunil Babu, deputy director of the Reserve said that the cub was found inside the forest, near the Mangala Devi Temple on the border with Tamil Nadu on November 21 last year. “Now Mangala is in a temporary shelter at Karadikkavala near to the place where it was sighted,” said Babu. “We do not provide natural food to the cub. It is being trained to hunt.” A cage, twenty by thirty feet in dimensions, has been constructed at ‘Onnam Mile’ in the deep forest. “The cub will be trained in nearly 15 acre of wild forest area that will be marked out and fenced. The width of the cage will be increased in time. The presence of humans will be avoided and when the tiger reaches two years it will be released into the Periyar Tiger Reserve,” added Babu. According to officials, Mangala’s training will start with the chicken hunt and gradually it will be upgraded. The officials have claimed that Mangala’s training will be done as per the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) guidelines. According to officials, normally when a tiger cub is rescued from the forest, it is shifted to a zoo. But Periyar Tiger Reserve decided to adopt Mangala. “The training of Mangala is a worthy experiment and it is a new way of protection and survival. The survival of Mangala is a big success,” said PS Essa, former director of Kerala Forest Research Institute.

---||Dehradun||U’khand cabinet defers decision on Gairsain Commissionerate||Dehradun: Former CM Trivendra Singh Rawat's announcement in the state assembly to make Gairsain the third commissionerate of Uttarakhand was put on hold by the state cabinet on Friday. The Gairsain division decision had created a strong reaction from within the ruling BJP and saw a string of protests in Almora district which was supposed to be a part of the new division. With a surge in Covid-19 cases, the cabinet also decided to keep schools in three districts — Dehradun, Nainital and Haridwar — closed till April 30. Dehradun has been the highest contributor to the positive cases and taking the fact into consideration, the cabinet gave the nod to a proposal to implement a night curfew from 10pm to 5am in the municipal area of the state capital. Sharing the details, agriculture minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal said, “In wake of the public feelings, the cabinet has decided to defer the issue of making Gairsain a new Commissionerate of the Himalayan state.” Confirming that schools from Class I to Class XII would remain closed, Uniyal said, “In Dehradun, schools would remain shut, barring Kalsi and Chakrata areas. In Nainital, all schools under Nainital municipal area and Haldwani municipal area will remain closed. All schools under Haridwar would remain shut. Offline classes would be permitted only for Class X and Class XII. For other classes, schools can have online classes.” Uniyal further stated that as a high number of Covid cases were being reported from Dehradun, there would be a night curfew within the Dehradun Municipal Corporation area. “Only in emergency cases, people would be allowed to commute,” said the minister. In another decision, the cabinet, besides the MSP of Rs 1,975 per quintal on wheat procurement, has announced a Rs 20 bonus per quintal. A total of 241 procurement centres have been opened and four procurement agencies have been authorised for the purpose. The total target is to procure 10 lakh metric tonne of wheat. Under the CM Mahalaxmi Yojna, the cabinet has approved giving a “Mahalaxmi” kit to á new born girl child. The scheme will be applicable for the maximum of two girl children. “A kit which would consist of a blanket, clothes and nutritious food would cost Rs 3,500. Our target is to cover 50,000 women under the scheme,” he added. Due to Covid-19, the government in March last year had relaxed the procurement norms for DG Health, principal of Medical Colleges. The relaxation has been extended for six months. The state would not charge stamp duty for Rs 66.90 crore Plastic Park to come up at SIDCUL land in Sitarganj area of Udham Singh Nagar district. On the guidelines of the Centre – which is contributing half of the project cost – a Special Purpose Vehicle has been prepared by the state. The cabinet has also approved the construction and repair of 2,038 Panchayat Bhawans in Uttarakhand. “In the first phase, we will take up the buildings of 400 Panchayat Bhawans. Each building would cost Rs 20 lakh and out of the total 50 percent would be provided through MGNREGA funds, 25 percent through panchayat resources and remaining 25 percent by the state,” he added. To check unregulated deposits by unauthorised firms, the cabinet has approved the forming of rules and guidelines. “Overall seven organisations are allowed to deposit money. But it has been seen that through the kitty and chit fund, fraudulent firms dupe money of investors. The Centre has advised us to adopt the guidelines formed by Karnataka. We will study the Karnataka model and, thereafter, take a decision. In the absence of proper rules and guidelines, the investor cannot complain and the government did not have the right to attach the property of the person carrying out fraud,” said Uniyal. For different projects, those awarded works had to submit a performance security which was 5 percent to 10 percent of the total cost. The cabinet gave nod to a proposal, which has brought down the performance security to 3 percent. Similarly, a bidding security has to be submitted by the firms. The cabinet has removed the bidding security completely.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-cabinet-defers-decision-on-gairsain-commissionerate/articleshow/81994291.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Sachin Waze sent to judicial custody till April 23||MUMBAI: After almost a month in NIA custody, suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Waze was on Friday remanded in judicial custody till April 23. The court directed jail authorities to adopt necessary security measures after Waze’s lawyer submitted that he feared for his life as he had investigated several cases in his capacity as a police officer. Waze was made to sit in the accused dock. During the hearing, the prosecution raised objections about Waze’s letter being leaked and circulated after it was given to his lawyers. The prosecution said it was serious. On Wednesday, Waze had submitted a four-page letter alleging two ministers had ordered him to extort money. The court did not accept the letter, telling him to follow due procedure. The court iterated this on Friday. It said that he had a right to make submissions but had to follow procedures under the Criminal Procedure Code, be it related confessions and other provisions. tnn “Next time this should not happen. You should adopt a procedure. You have every right... but go by procedure,” the court said. The defence advocate said that he was unaware and was surprised too. The prosecution also told the court that his April 8 medical report showed that he did not need any cardiological intervention right now. The defence had earlier sought an angiography to be conducted on Waze. Meanwhile, the court allowed the CBI plea seeking some documents in the cases it is investigating against Waze and a co-accused. Earlier this week, the CBI registered a preliminary enquiry in connection with the Bombay high court order to investigate allegations levelled by former police commissioner Param Bir Singh against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh. On March 13, Waze was arrested by the NIA in connection with the probe into the recovery of explosives from an SUV found parked near businessman Mukesh Ambani’s south Mumbai residence on February 25. The NIA is also investigating the Mansukh Hiran murder case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-waze-sent-to-judicial-custody-till-april-23/articleshow/81996803.cms||---

In the second incident, a 29-year-old man was stabbed to death at a Tasmac bar near Gandhi Park on Thadagam Road on Friday evening. Police said Chandru, son of Kumar, from Chokkampudur, was murdered by two of his friends after an argument broke out between them while consuming liquor. While Chandru was taken to the CMCH immediately, doctors declared him brought dead. “His friends had escaped from the spot soon after committing the crime,” said a police officer. The RS Puram police have registered two separate cases and formed as many special teams to nab the murderers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/rs-puram-folk-shocked-over-two-murders/articleshow/81995894.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Wheat being procured at MSP in city: BJP||New Delhi: Leader of the Opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri on Friday said that he and other party functionaries would go to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence to meet him on Saturday over agriculture minister Gopal Rai’s recent remarks that the Centre was making false claims on wheat procurement and that there was no Food Corporation of India (FCI) counter in the city. Calling Rai’s statement false, Bidhuri asked him to resign. He asserted that FCI had started procuring wheat at minimum support price on April 6. “If my statement turns out to be false, I’m ready to resign. Otherwise, the minister must resign,” said Bidhuri, who was flanked by BJP MLAs, including former Leader of Opposition Vijender Gupta. Bidhuri said he would try to meet Kejriwal and if he was not given an audience, would stage a dharna along with BJP MLAs and functionaries. “After Delhi government didn’t respond to FCI’s requests to verify the details of farmers, like Aadhar card or land revenue records, and from whom wheat was to be bought, it was decided that procurement would be done at FCI godowns in Narela, Najafgarh and Mayapuri. Verification is important to eliminate middlemen or dubious people so that only genuine farmers get MSP for their produce. FCI started procurement of wheat at its three centres at the MSP of Rs 1,975 per quintal,” said Bidhuri. The BJP functionary further stated that he and Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta had initiated the procurement of wheat from farmers at Narela on April 6. “This rattled Delhi government and they did not know how to react. The government was caught on the wrong foot as its campaign to defame the central government on not giving MSP for wheat fell flat,” claimed Bidhuri. Gupta claimed there was video and photographic evidence to show that wheat procurement was being done at Narela, Mayapuri and Najafgarh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/wheat-being-procured-at-msp-in-city-bjp/articleshow/81997376.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Delivery boys to pvt workers, repeat testers, all crowding testing centres||NAGPUR: People stand rubbing against each other in front of a window to get their RT-PCR test report at the Raj Nagar centre of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). Next to it, there is an equally crammed queue of patients waiting to give their swab samples. A woman in her 40s sat down right there. “I have been waiting since 10am,” she said giving a weary expression. It was already half past three by then. The number of persons walking in for Covid tests has been only increasing in multiples over the days. A fresh wave has been added due to the recent order making RT-PCR mandatory for those engaged in food delivery, staffers at private shops or other similar jobs. Amid overflow at testing centres even as capacity of laboratories remains the same, it has already begun telling on the system. Each of the government testing centre has fixed its own cut-off beyond which samples are not collected. Reports are already getting delayed, said officials at the centres. “We are only taking in up to 250 patients, the rest have to go back,” said an official at the Law College testing centre. It was 2pm and reports of the samples collected on Thursday were still awaited. “In the normal course the reports should have reached the centre in the morning itself,” said a staffer. Apart from medical reasons, there is a sizeable number of persons coming to get tested because of the recent order for a section of private employees. At Raj Nagar, no registrations happen after 2pm. Yet, the crowds were overflowing. “The reports are getting delayed,” admitted a staffer here. Among the others was a group of sales personnel engaged by a credit card company walking out after giving their samples. “The centre may end up testing almost the 800 persons each day if half are not turned away. There is a huge rush of delivery boys wanting to get tested. We are also insisting on prescription or letter from the employer so that the crowds are controlled,” said a source at Pachpaoli.. “Almost 50 persons each day turn up for a repeat test after barely two to three days. They hope that a second test may get them a negative report. They are turned back,” said a staffer here. At Dhruv Labs, a private laboratory at Ramdaspeth, the queue extended till the pavement. A team of food delivery boys said their company has asked them to get tested at their own expenses. The reimbursement would come in 15 days. “With sudden rise in testing numbers, it’s not easy to get the reports in 24 hours. This is leaving the patients irritated. It’s getting tough to upload data on the ICMR website also,” said Dr Sailesh Mundhada of Dhruv Labs. As the government has reduced the rates for RT-PCR tests for private labs, some have stopped the home collection services. The NMC’s centre at RPTS which has handled 40,000 samples so far continues to get reports in a day. The samples are sent to the lab at Neeri. “The staff is now getting overburdened. If an additional team is granted, two shifts can be run here,” said an official requesting anonymity. “There is not much for our own safety. The centre has been shifted to a small waiting lounge barley big enough to house the entire team. Some of the staffers have already tested positive. At RPTS also not more than 300 to 320 are taken in each day,” the source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/delivery-boys-to-pvt-workers-repeat-testers-all-crowding-testing-centres/articleshow/81995094.cms||Shishir Arya

The books had reached 217 education blocks, which used to be distribution points. A board official said: “Earlier, students would get these books in June but last year it took until September or half of the session due to the pandemic. This year, the supply is in time but no one to collect the sets.” The officials said that to get books to the students in-time this year, the board had doubled its paper procurement agencies and also increased its printers and publishers from 28 to 43. The board used to publish 361 titles every year, a number that has dipped to 210 because of last year’s unsold stock. This year, the board printed 2.10 crore copies of textbooks and dropped 1.5 crore of those worth Rs 58 crore at government schools. The remaining books will be sold through private vendors and sent to the education board in Rajasthan. The officials revealed that PSEB used to sell out around 60 lakh books worth Rs 10 crore every year to the affiliated schools in Punjab. Besides, it use to sell Punjabi books worth Rs 40 lakh to Rajasthan education board and books worth Rs seven lakh to the Chandigarh administration. This year’s sales to the affiliates are Rs 6 crore. The board spend Rs 52 crore on quality paper and Rs 12 crore on accurate and safe printing. Board chairman Yograj Singh said, “Besides increasing paper procurement vendors and book printers, a micro-level monitoring was done, beginning with the procurement of paper to supply books. Tenders for cover-paper and text papers of books were also floated timely. Around 60% of the stock of books meant for affiliated and associated schools has been already been sold during the last three months.” There are around 12,000 government schools and around 3300 PSEB affiliated and associated schools in Punjab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pseb-books-land-on-time-this-year-but-schools-are-shut-across-punjab/articleshow/81995096.cms||Bharat Khanna

This hospital was singled out by the central team which visited Nashik district on March 10. At that time, the team had raised concerns about the high death rate in the hospital in February. However, dean of the hospital Dr. Mrinal Patil said that the CFR that stood at 31% in February earlier dropped to 13% in March. Speaking to TOI, Patil said, “In March, the CFR has dropped to around 13% from 31% in February. We have high number of patients coming to the hospital for Covid-19 treatment.” “In March, the hospital witnessed 37 deaths as compared to 32 in February,” Patil said, adding that in March, the hospital had admitted 281 patients while in February, there were 103 admissions. The dean said that there were different reasons why the CFR had come down. “The best part was that the patients – though critical — were coming to the hospitals early and there was scope for doctors to do their best to save their lives,” said Patil. A two-member team visited the hospital on Friday and interacted with the staff for over three hours. The team expressed satisfaction regarding the hospital’s treatment and facilities, said Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/covid-fatalities-at-adgaon-hospital-reduce-to-13/articleshow/81995098.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Coimbatore||Covid fear, lack of hope in election process hit polling||Coimbatore: A whopping 9.64 lakh voters, who constitute 31.3% of the electorate in the district, hadn’t exercised their right to franchise in this assembly election. The reasons varied from fear of contracting Covid-19 to lack of hope in the election process. As per the available data, at 1.30 lakh, Coimbatore North topped the list of urban constituencies with the largest number of voters who stayed away from voting, followed by Singanallur (1.25 lakh) and Coimbatore South (99,281). Fifty-seven-year-old Srinithi* (name changed), from RS Puram, said she skipped the election because of the pandemic. “My parents are aged above 80 years and I am the only person to look after them. Since Covid-19 cases are rising sharply in the district and the elderly people are considered more vulnerable, I didn’t vote this time as I didn’t want to be a carrier.” She said while they had applied for special postal ballot option and submitted form 12D for her parents, the same was rejected for reasons unknown to them. Another voter, U Akilandeshwari, who resides in Singapore, said her family decided against flying to vote, as they thought it would be risky to travel all the way to India, where the number of Covid cases was rising constantly. “We cannot afford to stay in the country for more than a week. We were afraid of a possible lockdown and cancellation of flights like in the previous year, and Singapore denying entry of people travelling from India. We didn’t want to put our livelihood at stake.” K Kannan, of Saravanampatti, meanwhile, gave a miss to his first-ever vote. While he wanted to give an opportunity to new candidates, who didn’t belong to the two major Dravidian parties, he boycotted the election as they failed to turn up in his locality for campaigning. “Also, I am sure that only one of the two Dravidian majors will win the election. Hence, I thought why I should I brave hot weather and take pains to cast my vote for someone who did not even campaign in my area. So, I decided not to vote. And it is in a way my right too,” he said. There were also people who couldn’t vote, as their names were deleted from the voters’ list. M Ali Akbar, a resident of Peelamedu, said his parents couldn’t vote as their names were deleted from the electoral roll. “They had voted in the parliamentary election. We had ensured that their names were in the list when a special camp was conducted in our locality in January. We don’t know how their named got deleted. When requested to include their names in the list, poll officials asked us to apply for fresh voter ids before the next election.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/covid-fear-lack-of-hope-in-election-process-hit-polling/articleshow/81995935.cms||Nivedha Selvam
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: NanoSniffer can detect explosives within 10 secs||Mumbai: Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ launched NanoSniffer, a micro-sensor based explosive trace detector on Friday. It can detect explosives in less than 10 seconds and can identify and categorize explosives into classes, claimed its makers. “It detects all classes of military, conventional and homemade explosives. NanoSniffer gives visible and audible alerts with sunlight-readable color display,” a press note stated. The detector has passed Pune-based DRDO’s High Energy Materials Research Laboratory testing and has also been tested by the country’s counter-terror force, National Security Guard. Pokhriyal said it was a step towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of a self-reliant India. It is a 100% made-in-India product in terms of research, development and manufacturing. The minister said the affordable device will reduce India’s dependency on imported explosive trace detector devices. “It will encourage other institutions, startups and medium-scale industries to research and develop products indigenously,” he added. It is developed by NanoSniff Technologies, an IIT-Bombay incubated startup. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nanosniffer-can-detect-explosives-within-10-secs/articleshow/81995944.cms||---

Addressing reporters after the meeting, D’Sa said that the issues were “minor” in nature and all of them were resolved at the meeting. As regards accusations by traders that the sopo contractor was charging excess fees, D’Sa said that the occupancy rates were recently hiked by the SGPDA and the vehicles were being charged on hourly basis. “The traders, however, had no issues with the sopo rates, provided they were given slips against the payment, which has been agreed to by the sopo contractor. Identity cards will also be issued to the personnel collecting the sopo so that there is no unauthorised collection,” D’Sa said. D’Sa said that since he took over as the SGPDA chairman in 2019, he has put in place a proper system at the wholesale fish market by demarcating separate areas for wholesale fish traders, ramponkars and others. “This was a non-issue and turned into a political one. The wholesale fish traders were instigated for political reasons,” D’Sa said. President of the wholesale fish traders association, Ibrahim Musa, had contested the authority of the sopo contractor, Milagres Fernandes in collecting the sopo on the grounds that his contract had expired, while the latter had alleged that Musa’s actions were “politically motivated” and aimed at maligning his image considering that he was contesting the upcoming Margao municipality elections. The standoff between the two had resulted in a shortage of fish at the wholesale fish market as fish vehicles hadn’t entered the wholesale fish market for the last several days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/traders-sopo-contractor-standoff-at-wholesale-fish-market-finally-ends/articleshow/81995969.cms||---

On April 10 and 11, all shops, except those that sell essentials such as food items and medicines, will remain shut and so will civic parks. No one can step out of their buildings to even visit restaurants or food stalls for a takeaway; people can call a restaurant directly or order via apps for home delivery though. Delivery of all food items, essential and nonessential products including liquor, is allowed. Those who flout Mumbai police’s prohibitory orders on assembly of 5 or more persons will face punishment under the tough Section 188 of IPC. Weekend lockdown: All outdoor activity ceases in MumbaiCivic officials said on Friday they made announcements on weekend lockdown rules in various localities to ensure compliance. Security staff at public parks, too, were seen alerting those who had landed up for walks or to jog about the weekend closure. Those found flouting Mumbai police’s prohibitory orders under Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC)’s Section 144 that restricts assembly of five or more people as well as night and weekend curfew between April 5 and 30 will face punishment under Indian Penal Code Section 188 for disobedience to an order promulgated by a public servant. The section attracts simple imprisonment of 1 month or fine of Rs 200 or both, or 6 months and Rs 1,000 fine or both if it causes danger to human life, health or safety. Corporator Renu Hansraj said at Juhu market, civic staff made shopkeepers down their shutters, except for essential shops. “I have already written a letter to the BMC commissioner that a middle path has to be worked out for those selling non-essentials as they need to sustain their livelihood. They should be allowed to operate by ensuring social distancing.” A senior BMC official said sealed buildings have their own challenges. “Especially in sealed lowrise buildings, many are seen walking in and out, despite a banner clearly indicating movement is restricted. It is not possible for us to monitor them all through the day,” he said. The city has 750 sealed buildings and 9,981 more where only floors have been sealed. In Matunga, Rajesh Nishar, who runs a readymade garment shop, said civic authorities have been “very strict and even if any shop is found with half its shutter open, they immediately warn of action”. BMC commissioner I S Chahal, in an order issued on April 8, clarified restaurants can take orders for home delivery too.  Ravi Raja, opposition party leader in the BMC, said he has written to Chahal requesting he waive off licence fees of restaurants and small shop owners till lockdown-like restrictions are in place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/weekend-lockdown-all-outdoor-activity-ceases-in-mumbai/articleshow/81995939.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Nagpur||RT-PCR for travel, jobs, home delivery hitting real Covid-19 patients||NAGPUR: Following state order to ramp up testing under ‘Break the chain’, most districts in Vidarbha have made RT-PCR test mandatory for shop-owners, staff, helpers, delivery executives etc irrespective of their health status. Moreover, RT-PCR negative report has been made mandatory for inter-state travel by many states. With this, labs are thronged with samples of such asymptomatic people. This has ultimately increased the load over labs and created problems for real Covid-19 patients. “Please avoid unnecessary travel, which requires negative RT-PCR report. Diagnostic labs are exhausted. We are not getting reagents for the tests. Due to this, those who really require to be diagnosed are not getting tested in time. This may worsen the pandemic crisis,” said Dr Prasad Kulkarni, general secretary of Maharashtra Association of Practising Pathologists and Microbiologists. As per the government’s ‘Break the chain’ order dated April 4, staff of private tourist vehicle operators, those engaged in film shoot, TV serials, advertisements, home delivery persons including newspaper delivery boys, roadside vendors, construction labourers, and many others must undergo RT-PCR test and the validity of the same will be 15 days. This means, these persons need to undergo re-testing every 15 days if they want to continue working. Labs — both in government and private sector — are overloaded with samples and working 24x7 for the last many days. Working in back to back three shifts, labs in AIIMS, GMCH, IGGMCH are conducting 2,000 tests per day. Long queues in front of the sample submission centres indicate that more number of people are coming out for the test. “Those who have symptoms of Covid-19 deserve to be tested on priority. But, there is no system to prioritize the samples of patients and hold back samples of those who are testing for other reasons like travelling,” said director of a private Covid-19 testing lab in Nagpur, appealing it’s now up to the people to avoid unnecessary testing. Professionals are also against the RT-PCR mandate. “Instead, we are ready to get vaccinated and produce the inoculation certificate. What is the point in repeatedly getting tested when you don’t have any symptoms?,” said Hrushikesh Niwal, who owns an automobile shop. Doctors also suggest that vaccination of delivery executives and shopkeepers who come in contact with hundreds of people daily should be done on priority, which will eventually reduce the load on labs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rt-pcr-for-travel-jobs-home-delivery-hitting-real-covid-19-patients/articleshow/81995102.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Despite several assurances from his employer, he is determined to go to his home town. For, he is scared that he might get infected.“More than me, my parents are scared and worried. They have been insisting me to return home as soon as possible ever since the cases started to rise. Because, last year, we had suffered a lot and with much difficulties, we had returned to our houses. We have learnt lessons the hard way and not ready to suffer again,” Dhilip Kumar, who had returned to his work in September, said. He had already sent his brother who was working with him, to his home town.He said he could manage to live a peaceful life back at home as he is planning to resume farming instead of living with anxiety and apprehensions here.“I am the last person to leave the city and most of my friends had already left. I would return to Coimbatore once things settle down,” he added.His employer R Surendran said it is only two of them who had the patience to wait till Saturday midnight when they have the next train service to Gujarat and 15 of my employees had already hired a bus and left the city.“Their parents are scared because of what happened last year and have been asking me to send them back,” he said.Another industrialist Ganesh said that the situation was almost the same in his and his friends’ industries. “Since only two of my workers are from the northern part of the country, I had managed to convince them to stay back. I had assured them to take care of all their expenses especially food if at all things get worse,” he added.Worrying about the pending orders, Surendran said that he has been convincing his other workers who had gone on a long leave to their native states for Holi to return. “They seem to be hesitating even after assuring to take care of their transportation charges. It is only now we have started to return to normalcy and if we are to stare at the labour shortage, we would end up facing huge loss at our business,” he added.Industrialists are hoping that the situation would improve, and the number of cases would come down with new restrictions in place.Coordinator of the Federation of Coimbatore Industrial Association (FOCIA) J James said that over 70% of the workers mainly guest workers have started asking permission to return to their native states due to the anxiety and apprehension and it has already started to take a hit on the productivity of the industries. The government should intervene and take steps to resolve the issues because industries cannot bear another blow, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/new-norms-give-industries-hopes-of-better-tomorrow/articleshow/81995941.cms||Nivedha Selvam

---||Ludhiana||Who cares? Covid rules go into quarantine||Ludhiana: To check the spread of Covid-19, the government has imposed multiple restrictions. But one round of the city’s markets shows that the police administration has completely failed in enforcement of Covid norms. There are no checks to ensure people entering shops are wearing masks, using sanitisers or maintaining appropriate distance. During the first wave of the coronavirus, the police had deployed volunteers at different markets and had also appointed Covid monitors in shops. These volunteers and monitors ensured that the visitors followed norms. The TOI visited markets in Old City, Sarabha Nagar, Dugri, Ghumar Mandi, Mall Road and Jawahar Nagar and found norms being run over. In Dugri market, many people were seen roaming around without masks. Shops had displayed posters, asking people to wear masks and foot-operated sanitisers were also kept at the entrance. But nobody was ensuring if people were wearing masks and using sanitiser. A bakery owner in Dugri said, “At times, customers get offended if we ask them to wear mask. Earlier, we had deployed a guard to get hands of visitors sanitised. People should follow norms on their own. We cannot afford to lose our customers.” In Sarabha Nagar too, shops were dotted with mask-less shoppers and unused sanitisers. The situation was better at the shopping complexes and some big stores, where staffers were checking the fever of customers, making them sanitise their hands and wear a mask.A city-based resident from Gill Road, who has defeated the virus, said, “I am surprised at the administration that has become lenient. I had gone shopping in Ghumar Mandi and not at a single shop they tested fever or used a sanitiser. Not only people, but the police administration has also become careless.” In crowded Old City areas, where there are several congested markets and roads, there was no surveillance. Cops were present at the main chowks and also issuing challans, but in the inner markets in areas like Kesar Gunj Mandi, Sabun Bazaar, Books’ Market, Gurmandi, Chaura Bazaar and Field Gunj, there were no checks. A shopkeeper in Kesar Gunj Mandi said, “The market is congested and crowded and so are the shops. At times, people have to jostle to reach near the shop counter. I don’t think we can enforce the social distancing rule here.” Commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal said, “We are organising meetings with the market associations. Big stores and malls are following the guidelines. We will ensure enforcement in other markets too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/who-cares-covid-rules-go-into-quarantine/articleshow/81994313.cms||Payal Dhawan

But in the wake of huge rise in the cases of Covid-19, the demand for allowing the persons below the age of 45 years to get vaccinated is rising. According to businessmen, a large number of workers and entrepreneurs are below the age of 45 years and, given their work profile of meeting large number of people daily, they need to be vaccinated at the earliest. Speaking on the issue, Hemant Abbi, executive member of the Moti Nagar United Factory Association, said, “There is steep rise in the cases and fatalities too are increasing day by day. Vaccination seems to be the only solution to safeguard one against this pandemic and great work is being done by the government. But capping of the age is acting as a hindrance in the efforts of the government, as huge number of people remain uncovered because persons below the age of 45 years are still not eligible for the vaccination.”Abbi also added, “Huge number of industry’s workforce and their immediate family members are below the age of 45 years and due to this they still have not got dose of vaccine shot. Workers are at high risk of Covid-19 because they come in contact with large number of persons daily therefore they should be administered the dose of coronavirus immediately. We request the government and authorities to allow vaccination of persons below the age of 45 at the earliest as along with ensuring safety of workers it will also help in coverage of majority of the population.”According to Abhinav Sehgal, executive member of Ludhiana Business Forums, “In addition to the workers, there is huge number of entrepreneurs in the city and elsewhere who are below the age of 45 years. Moreover, the work profile of the businessmen is such that in a day they have to meet many people. So, there is high risk of contracting Covid-19, which has become more dangerous in its second wave. So vaccination for people below 45 is need of the hour and we are even willing to pay for it and we request the government to lift the restrictions on age for getting a jab.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/bizmen-demand-lowering-age-limit-for-vaccination/articleshow/81994324.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Ludhiana||Most micro-containment zones exist without any safety measures in Ludh||Ludhiana: The district administration may have set up many micro-containment zones to check cases, but norms are not being followed to contain infection in majority of such zones and many of them are not even barricaded. According to the state media bulletin of Thursday, there were eight micro-containment zones in Ludhiana district — BRS Nagar, Model Gram, Rishi Nagar, Phase Two Dugri, Urban Estate Phase One Dugri, New Madhopuri areas of city and in Dhanansu and a village at Payal block.TOI checked how things were being monitored in many micro-containment zones and found that guidelines in most such zones were violated. At micro-containment zone in Model Gram area, where a two-member central team had visited on Thursday, there was a only rope at one of the entry/exit points where there was no such rope at the other end. Here there was no police presence and people were coming out and going inside the zone without being checked. Also, the rope that was tied at the entry/exit point of the street was around seven feet high so vehicles were crossing from there. At two micro-containment zones in Dugri area, TOI didn’t find any barricading and people were found roaming around in the streets. Many were spotted without masks as well. Here no cops could be seen. Local sources at New Madhopuri area, where one such zone has been made, said few days ago a rope was tied at the entry/exit point of the street but that has disappeared. They added that they didn’t find any cops stationed at the micro-containment zone. A resident of BRS Nagar where one such zone has come up said there is no barricading there and people move in the area freely. He added that no cops have been posted at such zone to control people coming out or going inside the zone.Civil surgeon Dr Sukhjeevan Kakkar didn’t respond to repeated calls, but a health department officer said district administration and police has to ensure a system so that people don’t come out or go inside such zones except in case of emergencies. He added that they will have to check why guidelines for many of such micro-containment zones are not being followed in these areas. Principal secretary, department of health and family welfare, Hussan Lal said the main purpose of containment zones is to close the area and in such areas normally physical road blocks are installed so that no one enters or goes out except in cases of emergencies, where one can call an ambulance and that can come. He added that in such zones special supplies are ensured by the district administration. Principal secretary further said round the clock police presence is a must otherwise there will be no containment. He added that regulations are same for micro containment zones.Commissioner of police (CP) Rakesh Aggarwal did not respond to repeated calls, a senior officer of Ludhiana police said that it was the administration which has to set up such barricades. However, he added that police presence will be beefed up in such zones. Deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma said he has told CP, SSPs to take immediate action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/most-micro-containment-zones-exist-without-any-safety-measures-in-ludh/articleshow/81994329.cms||Shariq Majeed

The incident occurred near Nagla Behlolpur village in Baghpat on Friday. A farmer from UP lost his life. According to Baghpat SP Abhishek Singh, the investigation is on and farmers on the other sides of the border are being identified. This is not the first time that such a clash has taken place in the region. In November also, a fierce clash had occurred over claim to agricultural fields of Niwada village at the UP-Haryana border. Every year, mainly due to the changing course of the Yamuna, post-monsoon, territorial disputes emerge among farmers often leading to heated arguments and clashes. In October last year, 14 residents of Tanda village in Baraut tehsil of Baghpat staged a protest at the DM’s office demanding action against farmers of Haryana who had allegedly destroyed sugarcane plantations in the area. Also, farmers in Sonepat district of Haryana were attacked, allegedly by UP farmers, in which almost a dozen farmers of Jajal village were hurt. Six districts of western Uttar Pradesh – Shamli, Saharanpur, Baghpat, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Bulandshahr and Aligarh – witness frequent clashes between farmers of the two states over ownership of farm fields at the inter-state border. In the backdrop of these clashes, the two state governments had agreed to cooperate in resolving half a century old issue and on January 8 last year, a meeting was held under the chairpersonship of then divisional commissioner of Meerut Anita Meshram but things went on backburner due to the Covid pandemic. At present, 132 villages of five districts of UP and 102 villages of six districts of Haryana are located on the border and witness frequent clashes over land disputes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/farmers-on-up-haryana-border-clash-over-land-claim-1-dead-several-hurt/articleshow/82107468.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Nagpur||Record 22k tests see record 6.4k +ve cases in dist||NAGPUR: The district on Friday reported 6,489 cases, its highest single-day tally since the pandemic started. It was also the third day in a row when over 5,000 cases were recorded. Also, for the first time the city reported more than 4,000 cases in a day. There were 63 deaths in the district on Friday, which were less than Thursday. In Nagpur rural, cases reduced by around 200 as compared to Thursday. The active cases in district have mounted to almost 50,000 now, stretching the health infrastructure to its limits. The district also saw highest-ever testing at 22,797, a jump of nearly 3,000 from Thursday. The rise in testing resulted in nearly 1,000 more positive cases as compared to Thursday. The case count in April so far is 40,186, which is more than any other month, except September last year (48,457) and March this year (76,250). With the first nine days recording over 40,000 cases, April’s tally could well surpass March’s figures in the next one week. Experts have observed that the current strain is highly infectious leaving entire families and housing societies positive in its trail. Infectious disease specialist Dr Ashwini Tayade said this time the infectivity is really high. “Patients are symptomatic and their condition is worsening fast. Even those in their 20s are badly affected, which was not the case during the first Covid wave,” she said. Dr Tayade said it was estimated that the surge would slow down at this point. “Now, it seems it is going to stay for some time. We really have to take precautions and stay alert,” she said. However, public health officials said that people are voluntarily coming forward for testing and the figures don’t actually reflect a single-day trend. “These results are pending for more than two days. A variation is seen in rural and city numbers every alternate day. Sometimes the numbers of city shoot up and on other days it is the turn of rural. As the backlog of one area gets cleared, the number goes up. Yet, there is no denying that the positivity rate has gone up,” they said. Meanwhile, late on Friday evening, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation released the bed vacancy data. Private hospitals have poor vacancy though more are being added. The NMC also added 10 CCCs, including 8 hotels, having 130 oxygenated beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/record-22k-tests-see-record-6-4k-ve-cases-in-dist/articleshow/81995188.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Chandigarh||HTET SELECTION:HC questions Haryana decision to extend deadline||Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court has asked the Haryana government to explain why its decision to extend the deadline for qualifying the Haryana Teachers Eligibility Test (HTET) to those post graduate teachers (PGT) who failed to qualify it till 2015 should not be stayed. The Haryana government has been asked to file its reply on the issue by April 30. The non-HTET qualified teachers selected on the basis of teaching experience through an advertisement issued in 2012 were given conditional appointments, that they qualify the HTET examination by 2015. However, the government had subsequently extended the deadline to April 2018 and now till April 2022. Justice Jasgurpreet Singh Puri issued the order while hearing a petition filed by Satvender Singh who had appeared for the selection process for PGT in history through the advertisement issued in June 2012 and was placed in waiting list in the final result. “The action of the state has adversely and prejudicially affected the rights of the petitioner because he was put in waiting list and now with the extension of this time by way of administrative instructions number of other persons have become eligible who would apply for the post which in turn would prejudicially affect his rights,” observed the judge. The petitioner’s counsel told HC that in the statutory rules, Haryana State Education School Cadre (Group-B) Service Rules 2012, one of the qualifications for the PGT history post was that the candidate must have a certificate of having qualified HTET. However, the state of Haryana vide amendment dated July 2, 2012, amended the rules by providing that in the case of direct recruitment, teachers working in privately managed government-aided recognised and government school, are exempted from having qualifications of HTET and BEd., if they have worked as a teacher for a minimum period of four years on the date of enforcement of these rules. However, such candidates selected on the basis of working experience were asked to clear HTET by April 2015. The petitioner in this case was aggrieved by the government decision to extend the deadline of April 2015. His counsel submitted that it is a settled law that administrative instructions cannot override statutory provisions/rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/htet-selectionhc-questions-haryana-decision-to-extend-deadline/articleshow/81995166.cms||Ajay Sura

---||Chandigarh||14 farmer leaders, 125 others booked for burning BJP leaders’ effigies, blocking road||Hisar: Police registered a criminal case against 14 farmer leaders and 125 unknown persons (15 women) who allegedly blocked the road while burning effigies of BJP national president J P Nadda and state president Om Prakash Dhankar in front of the BJP office in Hisar. This was in retaliation to BJP leaders burning the effigy of farmer leader Darshanpal in Hisar on March 30. Police kept this FIR a secret for 10 days. According to the FIR, on March 30, the city police station registered a case on the complaint of ASI Sumer Singh against Dilbag Singh Hooda, state secretary of the farmers’ union, Shamsher Singh Numberdar, Sube Singh Boora, Satvir Poonia, Anu Sura, Manisha Bishnoi, Vikas Sisar, Kuldeep Sehrawat, Randhir Bamal, Mangeram Bhakar, Rajeev Malik, Ram Avatar, Sukhbir and Sandeep and 110 unknown persons under sections 147 (rioting), 149 (common object of unlawful assembly), 341 (wrongful restraint), 283 (obstruction in public way) of Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act. In his police complaint, ASI Sumer said he was on duty along with other employees during a meeting held at BJP office in Sector 14 on March 30. At around 1pm, about 100 to 125 people came from Hisar bus stand, raising slogans. When they saw the police, they blocked the road. The complainant said people urged them to lift the blockade but they did not relent. He said they also broke the grill and saplings on the divider and kept the road blocked for about two hours. On March 30, BJP leaders burnt the effigy of Congress party, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and farmer leader Darshan Pal Singh in front of the BJP office on Sirsa road in protest against the attack on BJP MLA Narang in Punjab. Angry farmers demonstrated outside the BJP office and burnt effigies of BJP national president J P Nadda and O P Dhankhar. Police claimed to have tried hard to stop farmers from burning the effigies. A day after, on April 1, 2021, deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, who came to Hisar, also encountered resistance from farmers, due to which he had to use a helicopter to go from the airport to the mini-secretariat. After getting information about the case, farmers held a meeting in Jat Dharamshala and decided to meet the deputy commissioner to demand dismissal of the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/14-farmer-leaders-125-others-booked-for-burning-bjp-leaders-effigies-blocking-road/articleshow/81995184.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Control yarn price rise, Tirupur MP tells govt||Coimbatore: Tirupur MP K Subbarayan on Friday sought immediate intervention of the central government to check rise in yarn prices. The price rise has affected textile industries in Tirupur that were badly affected during the lockdown and are returning to normalcy, Subbarayan told reporters in Tirupur. “I had written a letter to Union textile minister Smrithi Irani in March and sought immediate action. But I received no reply from her or from her ministry. I am ready to meet the minister in person to discuss about the issue,” he said. Seven mills of the National Textile Corporation (NTC) are functioning partially after resuming operations after the lockdown, the MP said. “The government should take steps to supply yarn to industrialists in the state through the mills. It will not only be profitable for the industries but also to the corporation. By doing so, textile units here could get yarn at a reasonable price without any interruption in supply and the corporation would be able to provide work to all employees, apart from making profit.” Subbarayan requested the state government to encourage cotton cultivation in the state to meet the rising requirement. “I am planning to submit a petition to the state government in this regard, after the new government is formed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/control-yarn-price-rise-tirupur-mp-tells-govt/articleshow/81995946.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Coimbatore||Root wilt disease casts shadow over coconut plantations||Coimbatore: The Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) plans to submit a report on root wilt disease, which was reported in parts of Pollachi, to the state government.The report is likely to recommend funds to create awareness among farmers and conduct research into the phytoplasma disease.TNAU vice-chancellor N Kumar said the state government and farmers must take serious note of the fast-spreading disease, which has no cure. “It is a debilitating disease that has far-reaching consequences, like bringing down coconut yield in Kerala. It has been found in Pollachi and Kanyakumari,” said Kumar. “We plan to submit a report to the state government’s agriculture ministry for funds for awareness creation and research, and plan to bring in the coconut development board also.”Until the new government is formed, farmers have been advised to detect symptoms at the earliest and prevent spread to other trees. “If a tree is infected, they must be chopped down to prevent spread,” said Kumar.The symptoms include yellowing and marginal necrosis of leaflets, leading to them curving and bending downwards, resembling ribs of mammals. “Over time, leaves become smaller, shorter and narrower resulting in stunting of plants and reduction in size of coconuts. Rotting of roots is one of the major symptoms,” said Prabakaran, director of plant protection at TNAU.Unopened pale-yellow leaflets are susceptible to leaf rot disease, which causes reduction in photosynthetic area, disfiguration of trees and reduction in yield apart from attracting insects that feed, multiply and cause further damage. Scientists believe that the disease is transmitted by phloem-feeding lace-wing bug Stephanitis typica and plant hopper Proutista moesta.Prabakaran advised farmers to carefully monitor soil micronutrients. “Keeping the trees strong will help in prevention,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/root-wilt-disease-casts-shadow-over-coconut-plantations/articleshow/81995966.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Two BMC engineers ordered dismissed after fire reinstated||MUMBAI: Amid the controversy over the reinstatement of suspended police officer Sachin Waze, it has emerged that the BMC last year reinstated two engineers who were indicted in the 2017 Kamala Mills fire enquiry and were ordered to be removed from municipal service. The reinstatement was approved by the BMC in May 2020 citing shortage of staff to fight the Covid-19 pandemic – the same reason cited for Waze’s reinstatement – and they were taken back later last year. TimesViewTo take back two engineers indicted in the Kamla Mills fire probe and who were subsequently ordered to be dismissed as they were charged with negligence, dereliction of duty and connivance with malafide intention now reeks of mala fide intent. The BMC must scrap their reinstatement and ensure that such tainted officials are kept out.Assistant engineer M G Shelar and junior engineer Dharmaraj Shinde were found guilty in the BMC’s departmental enquiry (DE) into the Kamala Mills fire and charged with criminal negligence, dereliction of duty, connivance with malafide intention and failure to take action. Apart from the two, the BMC has reinstated sub-engineer Dinesh Mahale who was found guilty in the departmental probe and punished with severe reduction in pay. All three were suspended the day after a fire broke out at 1Above and Mojo’s Bistro rooftop restaurants in December 2017, killing 14 people. All three were posted in G-South ward when the fire broke out. The DE report made by the then additional municipal commissioner Vijay Singhal had stated that there was serious negligence and connivance on the part of the officials. A senior civic official said that after the order to dismiss them was issued, the engineers were given a hearing. “After the DE report, they are given punishment. But in case of removal from service, they are given another hearing before a final termination order is passed. In this case, the DE was over in 2019 and then a hearing was given but so far, it looks like a final termination order hasn’t been given,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-two-bmc-engineers-ordered-dismissed-after-fire-reinstated/articleshow/81995975.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

It is expected that 130 lakh metric tonnes of wheat will be procured during the exercise. The Reserve Bank of India has already cleared the cash credit limit (CCL) of Rs 21,000 crore. Punjab mandi board chairman Lal Singh said an appeal had been made to the farmers to bring their produce to markets in a staggered manner as a preventive measure in view of the pandemic. Passes are being issued to the farmers through the arhtiyas (commission agents). During the last rabi marketing season, the state government had managed to procure 127.13 LMT of wheat despite the Covid pandemic restrictions by issuing 17.51 lakh passes through arthiyas. He said health protocols would be maintained during the procurement process and to avoid congestion in the mandis, the number of purchase centres had been increased from 1,872 to 4,000. “Covid vaccination camps are being set up in all the 154 market committees across the state to inoculate the people above the age of 45 years visiting grain markets for wheat procurement. Social distancing will also be maintained during the entire exercise,” said Singh. The mandi board has arranged one lakh masks and 35,000 litres of sanitiser for farmers for use during their arrival in purchase centres. Besides, 10,000 masks and 10,000 bottles of sanitisers are being provided to 5,600 staff members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/wheat-biz-begins-today/articleshow/81995193.cms||---

The two allegedly had an argument over the bus hitting the three-wheeler. Police are trying to nab the bus driver, who is absconding. The auto driver was identified as Rishampal, a 40-year-old resident of Harsh Vihar. According to the police, on Tuesday around 9 pm, a low-floor airconditioned DTC bus plying on route number 33 rammed an autorickshaw at Wazirabad Road near Brijpuri. Locals and witnesses told police that the auto driver started arguing with the bus driver. “He also gathered other autorickshaw drivers in the vicinity to support him and was trying to get on the bus. Fearing a thrashing by the mob, the driver accelerated the bus, and Rishampal lost his balance, falling under the wheels of the vehicle,” said a senior police officer. “The bus ran over him and he was killed on the spot.” Seeing this, the bus driver jumped off the vehicle and fled. The matter was then reported to the police and the auto driver was taken to a hospital where he was declared brought dead and the body was sent for an autopsy. His family members were also informed. “A forensics team was also sent to inspect the spot. The bus was bearing registration number DL-1PC-9244.

The DDHS data shows 30,083 were inoculated in the Nagpur district on Friday. As per data from civic and district administrations, 28,772. The overall tally of six districts too had discrepancies in which a difference of 43 doses hasn’t been accounted for. DDHS Dr Sanjay Jaiswal didn’t respond to queries when pointed out that there were discrepancies in the data. The vaccine shortage led to further decline in daily vaccination achievement coming down to 44,244 (corrected figure) as compared to 53,750 a day before in the division. DDHS data shows 44282 were inoculated in the division. On the other hand, the stock depleted to such an extent in Gondia district that only one session was held where 30 took the jab. In Nagpur, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said the civic body received new stock of Covaxin which is being given at six centres. “We have two days stock of Covishield. It will suffice till Monday,” he said. The civic chief said the central government has lifted the curbs on vaccination of healthcare workers (HCWs) and frontline workers (FLWs), but with riders. “They will have to go through due verification process to ensure ineligible beneficiaries don’t take the jab. They can now take the dose only at government centres,” he said. On April 3, the health ministry had stopped registration of HCWs and FLWs after it came to fore that some ineligible benefacaries took the jab under this category. The GMCH officials said they received 1,500 doses of Covaxin at the fag end of the day. The drive was restarted around 4pm and went on till 10pm. Some more centres were closed in the city and rural areas due to shortage. On the other hand, private hospitals said they had enough stock for a week but suddenly the beneficiaries have disappeared. Some private Covid vaccination centres said they were unable to achieve even 50% of the day’s target. In Chandrapur, the district didn’t get any new stock and only two centres remained open. Amravati district civil surgeon Dr Shyam Sundar Nikam said the response was poor while stock of only two days is left. “Last night we got 6,000 doses. We started vaccination for HCWs and FLWs. The verification process is rigorous now,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/in-ddhs-data-1-3k-more-doses-given-in-dist-as-against-admin-figures/articleshow/81995199.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Some citizens have raised concerns over this exception. “As domestic help visit several households, they should be checked for their temperature and oxygen saturation levels at the entry gate itself. It is the need of the hour to implement Covid-appropriate rules in the strictest manner possible and take all precautions as the cases are increasing beyond control,” said Rajkumar Sharma, a Chembur resident. In some areas, though, residents said house help have taken the weekend off for fear of being pulled up by the police. Meanwhile, nurses and attendants for the ailing and senior citizens are allowed too.

Daily ridership has dropped from 25 lakh a day to below 20 lakh, sources said. A key reason is that ‘commuters are not allowed to stand in buses’ due to which there is no crowding. There are other reasons for the dip.

The state government had announced restrictions owing to the spread of Covid-19 cases from April 5, but as there was no clarity on tourism, safaris continued as usual. However, owing to the complete lockdown, Pench Tiger Reserve (PTR) has decided to close the parks on the two days. Tipeshwar sanctuary near Pandharkawda will also remain closed. CCF & Pench field director Ravikiran Govekar said, “Umred-Karhandla and Mansinghdeo sanctuaries, Pench and Bor tiger reserves will remain closed. We will refund the money to tourists who had made advance bookings.” Pench has also imposed restrictions on the number of tourists in a safari vehicle, reducing it from six to three. This will exclude the guide and driver. Those who have booked in advance and do not agree to this condition can also avail refund, said Govekar. The morning safari timings have also been changed from 6am to 10am earlier to 7am to 11am. MP Pench, which witnesses most of the tourists from Nagpur, has also decided to close down from Friday evening to Monday 6am, following complete lockdown in Madhya Pradesh from April 8. “Tourists will not be allowed inside the park’s core and buffer zone on Saturdays and Sundays. We have also advanced exit timing for tourists on Friday from 6pm to 5pm,” said CCF & field director Vikram Singh Parihar. One of the stakeholders and office-bearer of Pench Jungle Lodges Federation Sandeep Singh said, “It’s a bad year for the wildlife tourism industry. It was somehow trying to gather from unexpected shocks but the second Covid-19 wave has crippled the sector.” However, some stakeholders from Tadoba said, “Even as Tadoba has decided to keep tourism open, there has been a considerable drop in the number of tourists. There used to be no availability in tatkal booking on any given day, especially during summers, but bookings were available on Friday, and even on Saturday and Sunday. Many tourists from within and outside the state have cancelled bookings.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-keeps-tourists-away-parks-closed-on-sat-sun/articleshow/81994393.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Acting on a tip-off, a team of STF sleuths raided the office of a builder in the IT Park area and arrested Arjun Singh, a resident of Haridwar. STF SSP Ajay Singh said that Arjun was running the racket from the city. “The accused has told the police that his gang used to dupe people, mainly American citizens, on the pretext of providing technical support. Transactions worth crores have taken place from his account, mainly in US dollars. We are going to inform the enforcement directorate,” said Ajay Singh, SSP STF. According to STF, the modus operandi of the gang was to send an email to their target with fake pop-up error messages stating that malware had infected their computer and if not corrected, their personal and financial data could vanish. “A caller from Dehradun would contact users and urge them to get their system repaired against a fee (in dollars),” said Ajay Singh. Earlier, another gang member Nipun Ghandok was arrested by the FBI in Texas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kingpin-of-doon-based-gang-held-for-duping-american-citizens-under-the-garb-of-providing-tech-support/articleshow/81994395.cms||Gaurav Talwar

A total of 65% (3,74,000) students took the mock test on Friday. The 45-day online exam will be conducted for regular, backlog and ATKT in an MCQ format. Students can register complaints regarding their marks immediately after knowing the scores from their student profile. A single student will give the exam for a minimum of 5-6 subjects. A total of 32 lakh exams will be conducted in all. Physically challenged students will get 20 minutes extra to attempt the paper. Students who have not received their username and password should contact their college administration. A helpline number 020– 71530202 has also been set up. A ‘war room’ at the SPPU created for conducting these examinations is doing all to conduct the exam without glitches. The exam itself will be conducted by the SPPU’s Edutech Foundation. With the rise in Covid-19 infection in the city, the university management decided to conduct the examination online and to keep a tab on exam malpractices. It was also decided to conduct it through a proctored method. To avoid the issues that had come up the last time and also any problems during the exam, the SPPU has handed over the job of conducting the exam to the SPPU Edutech Foundation which will also outsource IT support from a private party, Mahesh Kakade, controller of examination at SPPU, said. The university has designated 75 officials for the examination for a total of 68 subjects. On the first day, about 26,000 students will take the examination. In comparison to other universities in the state, SPPU has the highest number of students taking the semester examination. The SPPU ‘war room’ was established to conduct the exam and resolve the issues of students if they come across technical difficulties while solving the paper. Kakade said, “Simultaneously, the officials in the war room will also monitor the students attempting the paper for any mischief or malpractices with the help of technology. The other university officials will also be able to watch the progress of the exam through the SPPU dashboard.” The exam department has also made provisions for resolving queries of the students through a chat box. A provision for registering online complaints has also been made. Apart from these methods, a call centre has been established where students could call for resolving their queries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/online-exams-for-over-6-lakh-sppu-students-start-today/articleshow/81995210.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

There were people in the lanes and by lanes of the two bazars, where some smaller grocery shops are located. Similar scenes were seen across the city in other markets in Nashik Road, Satpur, Cidco areas.Prafulla Sancheti, president of the Nashik Grocery Wholesale Merchants’ Association (NGWMA), said there was rush in the markets since Friday morning.“People are keen to stock on the grocery items. The footfall in the markets subsided a bit in the afternoon but again picked up from 5 pm onwards,” added Sancheti.He added that the association had requested the city police to allow the grocery shops to remain operational on weekends but the request had been turned down. “I still feel that the grocery shops should be allowed to function for the convenience of the people,” he added.According to a grocery shop owner, Sanchin Patil, he and his staff had a trying time in handling his customers throughout the day. “We had a trying time as customers wanted to be served quickly as they were keen to return home as quickly as possible,” said Patil.Many of the people at the market places said that they want to ensure that they have enough stock of grocery items and vegetables since they do not want to run out of these items during the weekend. Moreover, some apprehended that the state government could suddenly impose harsher restrictions and hence did not want to take any chances.“There is a possibility that the state government can declare a lockdown since Covid cases are rising unabated. Hence, there is a need to have enough stock of essential items,” said Anil Deshmukh, who was out shopping.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/goods-fly-off-shelves-as-nashikites-rush-to-markets-for-2-day-stocks/articleshow/81995244.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Consequently, the Centre deployed the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) in the Kumaon region to tackle the raging forest fires. While a 22-member team of the NDRF reached Nainital and even doused some of the fires in the hills, officials say another team will be deployed in Champawat soon. “Since Thursday night, the teams have been visiting the most-affected areas and doused at least half a dozen fires,” said TR Biju Lal, Nainital DFO, who has been with the NDRF team since Thursday. Lal added that the efforts by the NDRF team as well as forest department officials have improved the situation so much so that "only two or three fires are burning in the division at the moment". “The fires in the division have been brought under control. Our teams have been working across the region since Thursday and now a few fires remain which will be doused soon,” Lal also said. According to official data, Nainital is one of the worst affected districts. Since March 22, over 90 forest fire incidents have been reported here and 67 hectares of forest land has been gutted. Head of forest force, Rajiv Bhartari, had told the HC that the department suspects Nainital, Champawat and Almora districts to bear the brunt of the forest fires as all three districts have a large number of pine trees. Hence, the NDRF teams were also tasked with tackling the fires in this region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ndrf-deployed-in-kumaon-to-tackle-forest-fires/articleshow/81994410.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Kolkata||West Bengal polls 2021: BJP, LF bat for industry in TMC’s ‘land of promise’||SINGUR: Thirteen years after the Tata Motors factory left Singur, its ghost still haunts the area. It has resurfaced again at this election in speeches of Narendra Modi, Amit Shah, Mamata Banerjee, Sujan Chakraborty and Md Salim, who have campaigned in Singur that is a prestige seat, not for its contestants, but for what it represents. For Trinamool, Singur is a promise made and delivered. For BJP and Left, Singur is the tale of a lost opportunity at re-industrialising Bengal. Both have been promising to woo industry back to the scarred land. Trinamool’s Becharam Manna, who was elected from Haripal twice before being fielded from Singur this time, appeared unperturbed by the desertion of his one-time mentor or the industrialisation pitch that BJP and Left had raised. “One of the first promises that the Mamata Banerjee government had kept was to return the land that had been forcibly acquired from Singur’s farmers. A scheme of making rice available at Rs 2 per kg, which was launched here to help distressed farm labourers, has now been extended across the state. Companies have purchased land at a 10-acre site near Ratanpur for setting up agro industries. The government has set up a college and a trauma care centre,” Manna said. Four-term MLA Rabindranath Bhattacharya, who was a leading force in the movement against farm land acquisition, switched to BJP after Trinamool denied him a ticket. Following the shift, he apparently turned pro-industry, calling the rebuff to Tata Motors a historic blunder. “Singur and Bengal can’t progress without industry,” said Bhattacharya, known as Mastermoshai in the area. Left candidate Srijan Bhattacharya claimed everyone in Singur now understood the actual impact of the loss of an industry, which could have altered the destiny of the entire belt. “People were misled. Youths today need jobs,” he said. Farmers in Singur are also split over the land agitation and its consequences. Krishna Das of Beraberi village seemed happy that the government helped him get back his land, on which he cultivated paddy and vegetables. “I am glad that the government kept its promise and continued to support us,” he said. But not everyone shared his sentiment. While only a quarter of the 1,000-odd acres, which were acquired for the factory, has become cultivable, many who had joined the agitation now want industry and not dole. Giasuddin Mollah, a farmer from Joymolla, and Kartik Das from Gopalnagar claimed the new generation was not interested in farming. They want jobs. With the BJP and CPM vying for the youth, who were looking for new job opportunities, Trinamool believes it has an advantage with a stand that appeals to the more committed voters. Also, it is reassured by the fact that Bhattacharya’s defection has not led to the migration of mass party workers. His former aide and Singur panchayat samiti saha-sabhapati Pratima Das said all were working to “ensure Didi’s victory”. BJP, too, has been courting the constituency since it gained a lead from the Singur assembly segment in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. MP Locket Chatterjee has been visiting Singur often to garner support for the party. Though there was discontent among ground-level BJP workers when Bhattacharya was named the candidate, the issues have since been ironed out with the intervention of seniors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-lf-bat-for-industry-in-tmcs-land-of-promise/articleshow/81995260.cms||Falguni Banerjee

---||Nagpur||Jamaat brings Ayush docs & starts dormant oxygen centre at Pachpaoli||Nagpur: The walk-in O2 facility at Pachpaoli Covid Care Centre that was lying unused for over six months is running at full capacity soon after it was restarted a week ago. The 87-bed facility was set up when Tukaram Mundhe was the Nagpur municipal commissioner. The idea was to provide a stopgap arrangement to patients needing oxygen till they got a hospital bed, which are running short these days. It could not be made operational even six months after the whole facility was ready as doctors and other paramedic staff was not available. The issue was reported by TOI. The oxygen centre that remained in limbo finally got going a week ago after Jamaat-e-Islami-e-Hind (JIH), a Muslim religious and socio-political organization, came forward to run it. The JIH has allied with Medical Service Society (MSS) — an organization which has taken up a number of other projects with the Jamaat. JIH, which has pooled its resources, has also provided part of manpower to run the centre. This is an extension of the activities by Muslim organizations, including JIH, started during the first Covid wave, say sources here. “Apart from social service, it’s also aimed to do away with the misconceptions that cropped up after the markaz incident of the Tablighi Jamaat, which is a separate organization. The JIH hopes to come closer to other communities through such activities,” said Dr Anwar Siddiqui, president of JIH’s Nagpur wing. “We had started it a week ago, it was filled to half its capacity initially and soon it’s full. Some of the first patients will be discharged now,” said Siddiqui. He said the organization learnt about the centre through newspaper reports and approached the NMC and district administration to offer to run it at own expenses. “We were told that NMC will only pay for the MBBS doctors. There is indeed a shortage of MBBS, so we bridged the gap by brining 6 Ayush doctors (ayurvedic and other sciences), to run the show. Two MBBS doctors have been appointed as consultants also, who are being paid by the NMC,” said Siddiqui. Now, the expenses are being partly shared by NMC and JIH, he said. As NMC is paying for the MBBS doctors, GNM nurses and part of the ward boys, JIH is footing the bill for Ayush doctors, ANM nurses, housekeeping staff and other sundry expenses as volunteers are also helping the patients. Even counsellors have been appointed by JIH for the patients, he said. JIH has also started free oxygen services to home quarantined people, who are provided the gas on the basis of doctor’s prescription. Oxygen cylinders are stored at the markaz masjid and the facility is open for all. “The word Markaz should not be confused with the Delhi incident, as it only means a centre. The markaz masjid means the central masjid,” clarified Siddiqui.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/jamaat-brings-ayush-docs-starts-dormant-oxygen-centre-at-pachpaoli/articleshow/81995216.cms||Shishir Arya

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials said the complaint was being investigated. The trees would be replanted at these spots during the monsoon, a civic official said.“The incident happened on March 10 and came to light on March 12, when officials of the Smart City Development Corporation submitted a complaint to us. Six full-grown Saptaparni trees were cut at night and paver blocks kept on the spots. The PMC planted these trees 10-12 years ago,” said Ravindra Kamble, PMC’s horticulture mistry.Kamble further said that prima facie they suspect a builder, who has construction activities going on near the spot. “We have sent a notice to the builder and his reply will be studied. If the reply is not satisfactory, another letter would be sent after which the matter will be moved to court. Meanwhile, we will replant new trees in monsoon in the same area,” he added.Jaydeep Pawar, assistant municipal commissioner of the Aundh-Baner ward, said that evidence must be collected before moving court. “Nobody has the right to cut trees. What happened in Baner is illegal. Our team is investigating the matter,” said Pawar.Residents also want the culprits to be caught so that such incidents do not happen again. A resident said, “Such incidents should not be neglected. Tree cutting should be taken seriously by all authorities and the culprit must be booked. Pune is known for its tree cover, but we are slowly moving towards becoming a concrete jungle. This must be averted at all costs.”Rajkumar Waghchoure, senior inspector of Chatushrungi police station, said they are investigating the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/six-trees-felled-on-baner-road-pmc-confirms-replantation-plans/articleshow/81995222.cms||---

The spike in Covid-19 cases has taken out the fanfare from the festival. Panchanga Sravanam, the ritual of reading the almanac during Ugadi, is an age-old tradition. However, the readings of panchangam (almanac) in temples have been restricted, and purohits have decided to celebrate the festival within the temple premises with less number of devotees. “Instructions have already been issued to all executive officers of major temples in the city and the state to celebrate Ugadi in a simple manner in the wake of rampant Covid-19 cases,” minister for endowments, A Indrakaran Reddy told TOI. Usually, the state government used to celebrate Ugadi at Ravindra Bharati every year. As part of tradition, panchangam is read out in the presence of chief minister, cabinet ministers and senior bureaucrats of all government departments and cultural events are organised, but this year, the department of culture has not made the arrangements. “Till date, we haven’t received instructions from the state government to make arrangements for panchanga shravanam at Ravindra Bharati,” said a department of culture official. This is the second consecutive year the event here has been cancelled due to Covid-19, added the official. Similarly, an almanac reading is also organised at the chief minister’s camp office-cum-residence at Greenlands. This year, the event may likely be celebrated with fewer people. Meanwhile, minister Indrakaran Reddy will release the panchangam 2021 by Yadadri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Temple authorities at the commissioner of endowments office in Abids.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/surge-in-covid-cases-means-ugadi-festivities-to-be-low-key-this-year-too/articleshow/81995229.cms||Sunil Mungara

In the meeting, it was decided that a ranking index based on performance indicators should be prepared for the state universities and to decide these performance indicators, a committee of vice-chancellors and state officers should be constituted. The decision is an effort to enhance the quality of state universities. In the meeting, the governor laid thrust on good coordination between the vice-chancellor and registrar in all the universities and directed the state officials to take the problems of varsities seriously. Maurya said that universities should run programs for youths in rural and marginal areas of the hills to create employment opportunities for them and prevent migration. The Governor directed the universities to conduct programmes on World Environment Day (June 5) and on International Yoga Day (June 21). She added that arrangements should also be made to provide credit to students for planting saplings and taking care of those plants. She asked all the vice-chancellors to prepare water conservation plans and also the action plans to connect various stakeholders. The governor also asked the V-Cs regarding online and offline classes and examinations of universities. Maurya said that the universities of the state should work towards becoming a centre of excellence. She added that in the Covid-19 era, higher educational institutions of the state should run classes both online and offline and added that the students must miss out on education. The state officers pointed out that the colleges — earlier affiliated with HNB Garhwal University — have now begun the process to seek affiliation from Sridev Suman Uttarakhand University. Also, the universities were instructed to appoint faculty in colleges and allied institutions as per the prescribed norms. Further, the vice-chancellor and the finance secretary of the Pantnagar University were jointly directed to work out a solution to the matter of the lack of budget for the renovation of varsity buildings. Governor also instructed officials to resolve the issue of non-regular appointment of Controller of Examinations and Finance Controller which has been reported by many universities. She also took updates about the programs being run by the universities in the adopted villages. Meanwhile, Anand Vardhan, principal secretary of higher education, said that out of 106 colleges in the state, there are only four colleges that do not have their buildings and construction work is under progress in 23 colleges.

---||Nagpur||‘Genuine’ students missing out on exams to get another chance: VC||NAGPUR: In some good news for Nagpur University students missing out on their winter-2020 examinations for any reason, vice chancellor Subhash Chaudhari has assured to grant ‘genuine students’ another chance. Over 5,600 examinees have so far missed papers for reasons like slow internet connectivity or power failure since March 26. In the last couple of days, the university had already conducted re-exams of those hit by technical glitches on the very first day on March 26 due to server problems of Promarc Limited. TOI is regularly reporting on the plight of such students, who are on the verge of losing their semester, for no fault of theirs. “We’ve already instructed students missing out on exams to approach their college principals with a proper application, spelling out the reasons. The principals should submit all such applications to the NU Exam Section. We will conduct their minute scrutiny to check whether the examinee really suffered or just s/he is pretending,” Chaudhari told TOI. He pointed out that on NU servers they had every minute detail of all students who had successfully logged in. “We will check this data and find genuine cases. Most of the complaints are regarding insufficient time. Many times, it may happen due to students’ mistakes. We will check and allow genuine cases to re-appear for the exams,” the VC said, asserting that no genuine student would be go without the exams. He pointed out that the first phase of exams went off smoothly except the first day and some problems in the commerce papers due to minor errors in the question sets. “We’ve sorted out that issue on the same day by changing the software coding. We’re now looking forward to successfully holding the second phase.” On a large number of students skipping the exams, the VC said a majority of them had already cleared their papers in revaluation, but they had applied for the winter exams. “All these passed out examinees didn’t appear in the exams. Hence, the numbers are looking big, but in reality, they’re not. In every exam, there are normal absentees,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/genuine-students-missing-out-on-exams-to-get-another-chance-vc/articleshow/81995991.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

However, with the standoff between the South Goa Planning and Development Authority (SGPDA) contractor and wholesale fish traders has come to an end, prices are expected to regulate. “Owing to the unavailability of the regular quantity of fish in the retail market, there was a shortage which led to fish prices skyrocketing. Most of us had no choice but to source and sell frozen fish to make ends meet,” fish vendor Manjunath Nayak said. On Friday, only a few fish varieties, like mackerel and pomfret, were being sold at Rs 300 per kg and Rs 700 per kg, respectively. Even the humble peddi (mullet) was seen selling fast in the Panaji market. “While I can do without seafood for a few days, I have cats at home that cannot do without fish. I have to purchase whatever is available as a result, even if it is peddi,” a resident of Panaji said. About 10 days ago, tension gripped the SGPDA wholesale fish market after nearly 45 fish transportation vehicles were prevented from leaving the market due to non-payment of sopo (vehicle parking fees) to the contractor. Several of the vehicles were later released on the payment of the sopo. The incident was a fallout of the dispute between sopo contractor Milagres Fernandes and president of wholesale fish traders’ association Maulana Ibrahim. Soon after, a strong posse of policemen was stationed at the SGPDA wholesale fish market to avert any law and order problem. “There will be unlimited fish in Goa from Saturday onwards. We have been assured by the SGPDA that there will be no harassment with respect to sopo tax. The price increased because the interstate fish was not coming into Goa. Now, with the availability of fish, the prices will come down,” Ibrahim said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/more-fish-at-lower-cost-in-panaji-market-soon/articleshow/81996110.cms||---
---||Pune||Promotions for Std I-VIII on full year performance||Pune: Students of standards I to VIII of state board schools will be promoted to the next class on the basis of the continuous and comprehensive evaluation conducted during the year. The State Council of Education Research and Training on Thursday announced the guidelines to promote students to the next class. Students will have a remark stating ‘promoted to next class as per section 16 of RTE act 2009’ on their results. The SCERT has also stated that the schools should not conduct any new online or offline assessments and their performance based on the classes held during the year should be considered for awarding grades. Schools have been told to follow the SCERT guidelines in promoting students, Dinkar Temkar, director of SCERT, said. Teachers must convert the year-long assessments to cumulative 100 marks and give grades. “If the teachers have not been able to assess during the year, those students should also be promoted to the next class. Only the remark as stated under RTE must be mentioned on their progress cards and no other remark should be added,” Temkar said. The progress card needs to be prepared in time and distributed. The rule will be applicable to all state board schools run by the government and other local authorities, and private schools affiliated to the state education department. A special training of students must be conducted for those who have scored low in the assessments. The SCERT has produced books for bridge courses for teachers in training the students lagging behind. A government notification issued on Friday by the state education department stated that the students of Std IX and Std XI must be promoted based on practical, internal assessment, subjectwise tests, tutorials given for solving at home or other forms of assessments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/promotions-for-std-i-viii-on-full-year-performance/articleshow/81995232.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

While Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) issued fresh standard operating procedure (SOP) on Friday, pointing out that there are currently 27 active cases on the campus, including 24 students, Delhi University and Jamia Millia Islamia have also issued strict guidelines to restrict student movement on their respective campuses. Ambedkar University has, meanwhile, gone a step further and has announced that “offline classes shall be suspended in all campuses of the university till further notice.” The varsity has also postponed its MBA entrance test which was due on April 11. Speaking to TOI, AUD registrar Nitin Malik said, “Considering the increase in number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi, to ensure safety of its students, faculty and staff, the university has suspended offline classes.” On Friday, JNU issued a circular stating that the campus has observed 281 cases of Covid-19 since the pandemic began. The varsity has also witnessed five deaths due to virus. As part of renewed security measures, JNU has asked its wardens and deans to be vigilant, take precautions and enforce mask wearing, social distancing and hygiene. It asked its NCC and NSS to “create social awareness in all common areas and campus premises.” It also asked its security staff to take pictures of anyone not wearing a mask. Similarly, Jamia and DU has also issued guidelines limiting student presence on campus and have cancelled all future booking of seminar halls and auditoriums.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/univs-step-up-measures-aud-stops-offline-classes/articleshow/81997423.cms||---
---||Pune||Sunday’s MPSC test postponed||Pune: The examination for the Maharashtra subordinate services non-gazetted group B preliminary combined examination scheduled by the Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) on Sunday has been postponed by the state government. A new date would be announced later, a statement issued by the office of the chief minister of Maharashtra Uddhav Thackeray said. After the spike in Covid cases in Maharashtra and with many candidates who had registered for the exam testing positive, there was a constant demand from other candidates to postpone the examination. The statement said the postponement of the exam will not affect the age-rule of candidates appearing for the exam. “The age at the time of filling the form will be considered for the examination and candidates should not worry. Students will not suffer as a result of this decision,” the statement added. Many candidates had led an online campaign and also requested the state government to postpone the exam for a week. Thackeray conducted a meeting with officials of MPSC and the education department officials to take a review of the situation. After the meeting, it was finally announced that the exam would be postponed. The prelims of the MPSC Main exam was postponed four times in the past before it was finally conducted on March 21. The candidates had taken to the streets when the fourth postponement was announced in protest of the exam being pushed ahead for more than a year. Sushant Tidke, a candidate, said, “Many of the candidates are testing positive for Covid and the situation around is very critical so it is best to postpone the exam. The entire machinery to conduct the examination could instead be diverted to the Covid management in the city.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sundays-mpsc-test-postponed/articleshow/81995239.cms||---
---||Goa||Iranian club fails to submit papers on time, gets late landing slot in Goa||Panaji: Iranian league champions Persepolis FC were scheduled to arrive in Goa late on Saturday night for their AFC Champions League campaign but not before making a hue and cry over being denied an early landing slot at the Goa international airport. Last year’s finalists said they wanted to arrive in Goa on Saturday morning for the group stage games of the AFC Champions League, Asian football’s premier club competition, starting April 14. In an official statement, the club said “strange things have happened” since they prepared to travel to Goa on a chartered flight and accused India of “sabotage.” “The flight permit for the Persepolis convoy is not issued by India, and although members of the Persepolis team and club are waiting to start their journey and set up camp in Goa, there is still no positive news from the host country,” Persepolis said in a statement – translated from Persian to English -- on their website. The All India Football Federation, local organisers for the tournament, expressed surprise. “Persepolis needed special permission to land since they are coming by a chartered flight. The permission can be issued only if there are (landing) slots available,” a senior AIFF official told TOI on Saturday. Five days ago, AIFF said, Persepolis and the Iranian football federation were provided with contacts and necessary information to obtain landing permission through an authorised Dubai-based agency. “We are told there was a delay in submitting the documents and the club was clearly informed that there are no slots (for landing) till Sunday. They were asked to reschedule their flight,” said the official. Sources said it was just after midnight that Persepolis woke up AIFF officials, asking them to have a word with the concerned authorities and get the clearance. “Despite knowing that they do not have permission to land, the flight was again booked for Saturday. At midnight, who can we call? The club is blaming AIFF, but we have no role to play in this,” said the official. Goa airport director Gagan Malik later confirmed that Persepolis were scheduled to arrive in Goa on Saturday night. "An Iranian charter flight with a football team is arriving tonight at 11pm and on Sunday the Qatar team (Al-Rayyan) is coming on a charter flight. As of now, there is no cancellation," said Malik. Persepolis made it to the final of last year’s AFC Champions League where they lost 1-2 against Korea Republic’s Ulsan Hyundai. Persepolis will play UAE’s Al Wahda in the opening game of group E at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Wednesday at 8pm. FC Goa will take on the might of Al-Rayyan SC – coached by 1998 French World Cup-winning centre-back Laurent Blanc – in the second match of the opening day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/iranian-club-fails-to-submit-papers-on-time-gets-late-landing-slot-in-goa/articleshow/82009810.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Lockdown is thumb rule to ramp up health infra, says Tope||Mumbai: Health minister Rajesh Tope told a TV channel on Friday that the state is headed towards a lockdown, but he hoped cases are controlled soon. “World over, we have seen that many countries have gone in for a 15-day to three-week lockdown when cases began to surge. I am not in favour of a lockdown, but when health infrastructure is overwhelmed, the rule of thumb is to impose it so that we can ramp up facilities,” said Tope.According to data available with TOI, nearly 80% of isolation beds, 60% ICU beds and 32% oxygen beds are occupied.In Nagpur, relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar told mediapersons the state must enforce a complete lockdown for three weeks to save lives. Wadettiwar said, “There are 12 lakh workers engaged in various sectors on a regular basis. They use public transport, eat vadapav by the roadside, have tea outside.” Wadettiwarsaid no one had raised a voice against the Centre’s complete lockdown last year.  Despite lockdown-like restrictions, the state continues to add over 50,000 cases every day. “Some stricter steps will have be taken to break the chain. The CM will talk to major parties to come to a consensus,” said an official. Whether people can use local trains will be discussed. The CM chaired a meeting to discuss MPSC exams. At this meeting, a brief discussion on imposing a complete lockdown was held too. MNS chief Raj Thackeray, Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat and Wadettiwar supported a lockdown, said sources from the meeting. Pravin Darekar, opposition leader in the state legislative council, who attended the meeting too, told TOI: “I said the issue should be discussed in the presence of opposition leader in the state assembly Devendra Fadnavis and BJP state president Chandrakant Patil and demanded an all-party meeting on Saturday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-lockdown-is-thumb-rule-to-ramp-up-health-infra-says-tope/articleshow/81995995.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Hyderabad||Covid situation may worsen if norms ignored: Telangana health department||HYDERABAD: At least 70 sporadic clusters in and around Hyderabad are currently responsible for the rapid spread of the virus. While most of these are remnants of clusters which had emanated from schools and political meetings, new clusters are mostly being traced to hostels, markets and parties, say health department sources. The state health department has already issued an alert asking people not to venture out unless absolutely necessary. At least half of these clusters have emerged after political and social gatherings. “A good number of clusters actually originated around political meetings and rallies. Since meetings could not be avoided, the best we could do was to keep a strict vigil on the clusters. They are contained well and intensive testing has been taken up at these places to prevent further spread,” a health department official said. “In addition to political gatherings, marriages and elections, social gatherings are adding to the clusters. We already have a lot of clusters in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits. Now, the problem is that a lot of population in these areas stay in extremely congested setups. This makes the situation very complicated,” said Dr Sanjeev Singh Yadav, national secretary, Indian Medical Association’s Academy of Medical Specialities. Health authorities, meanwhile, said that currently there were only sporadic clusters, but there was a threat of the spread going out of control too. “It is a grave situation now and cases are going to increase further, if people do not follow protocols. The seriousness towards the situation has already gone,” a senior health official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ignore-norms-covid-situation-may-worsen-experts/articleshow/81995241.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Lab worker fakes ‘Covid -ve’ reports to make money, held||Mumbai: Cashing in on the surge in Covid testing numbers, a lab technician allegedly duped over three dozen people whose swab samples he collected for RT-PCR tests. Instead of sending the samples to the lab for testing, he discarded them, issued fake reports and pocketed the money. He was cautious to do this only for asymptomatic patients, but forwarded samples of symptomatic persons to the lab for testing as issuing them a ‘negative’ report would be outright foolhardy, said the police. Mohammad Salim Shaikh was arrested on Thursday after a woman, who had given him her sample for testing, alerted the police. Shaikh, a Malwani resident, was working for a diagnostic laboratory with multiple chains. He had recently collected the woman’s swab sample as it was a must at her workplace. A few days later, he handed her a ‘negative’ for Covid-19 report. The woman’s employer found something amiss with it. Senior inspector of Charkop police station, Manohar Shinde, said that typically reports issued by the lab bear the initials of the person whose sample it is. “It wasn’t so on the woman’s report,” said Shinde. “Her employer scanned the QR code on the report to find that it had someone else’s details. He informed the employee about it. The woman approached the police and a criminal offeence was registered. Shaikh was tracked down and interrogated. He confessed to having forged the woman's report, the police said. For over a month, Shaikh had noticed a surge in swab samples for testing. He devised this method to make a quick buck, said the police. “He would discard swab samples of people who were asymptomatic, without forwarding them to the lab. He would then forge the ‘negative’ report of some other person and would insert the current individual’s name on it, using some software,” said investigating officer Vijay Shinde. The police said that he issued such “forged” negative reports to 37 people and earned around Rs 37,000. The police said they have applied stringent charges against him as many people whom he falsely certified as ‘negative’ for Covid could have been positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lab-worker-fakes-covid-ve-reports-to-make-money-held/articleshow/81992724.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Chennai||Such a long wait after poll frenzy||By R RangarajIn previous elections, immediately after the campaign reached a crescendo, polling would take place, quickly followed by counting. The air of expectancy and suspense reached an immediate finale with the winning party forming the government within a few days of polling. This time the wait of more than a month is like the fervent buzz giving way to dreariness and fatigue.Earlier, the new chief minister, fresh from winning the mandate of the people would plunge into work. In 2006, M Karunanidhi signed the first set of orders of government soon after the swearing-in, not waiting to proceed to the secretariat for the purpose. J Jayalalithaa was flush with excitement when she assumed office within a few days of voting in 2001 and 2016, and announced implementation of a few of her poll promises. This joy of the victor and the celebratory mood of the winning party will be missed this time. The delay in taking up counting of votes cast for the Tamil Nadu assembly election also causes enormous post-poll expenditure to keep 24x7 vigil of the strongrooms, besides causing untold psychological stress on parties and candidates. Vast numbers of para-military forces, vehicles and material move from one part of the country to another, while leaders of various parties too have to prolong their campaign across several States for a period of six weeks. The entire schedule from the announcement of the poll process takes about 66 days, which means that for more than two months, the government is almost at a standstill, as no public servant would like to take a decision with the model code of conduct in place. Neither can the government announce any new projects. Further, the tendency of government officials is to avoid any action on files before them or to initiate fresh action as they are not sure which party will come to power in the elections.In the past few years, the Election Commission of India (ECI) has prolonged the election exercise to two months. If we take the history of Lok Sabha elections in the past 60 years, the LS polls held in the 1960s and 1970s were wrapped up in five to seven days even if there were three phases. In 1977, Morarji Desai was sworn in as Prime Minister within nine days of voting.In Tamil Nadu, there have been only two cases of delay in government formation since 1962. In 1984, the Union government led by Rajiv Gandhi delayed the exercise till the return of M G Ramachandran (after his surgery in the US), and his government was formed on February 10, 1985, 48 days after voting day. However, counting and declaration of results were not delayed. The second instance of delay was caused in 2011 by the EC decision to hold elections to the West Bengal assembly in six phases. Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry went to the polls on April 13, 2011, but counting was on May 13, when the elections in Bengal were over.This time though polling in TN took place on April 6, the votes will be counted only on May 2, after elections to the West Bengal assembly are concluded. No doubt, the EC believes that the results of one state’s election can affect polling in another state, and so has ordered counting only after the last phase of elections is over in all the states. However, if the 2016 model had been applied, the multi-phase elections in Bengal could have been completed earlier. At the time, West Bengal assembly polls were held in six phases from April 4 to May 5, 2016. The election to the Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry assembly were held on May 16 and results declared within three days.If the ECI wanted to hold multi-phase elections in West Bengal, should have held them prior to the dates in TN, Kerala and Puducherry as in 2016. In 2021, elections in Bengal could have been held in March, and the last phase prior to April 6, so that counting in Tamil Nadu could have been taken up on April 9, instead of having to endure an agonising wait for a month.Especially in difficult times like the corona virus, the EC should have restricted the poll process in Bengal, time span for campaigns, and reduced the gap between polling and counting. Several reports on the need for reforms in the election process are gathering dust at the EC and the law ministry, though former Chief Election Commissioners have reiterated the need to reduce the number of rallies and advertisements. One of the suggested reforms is not to allow any number of rallies, but restrict meetings to just one town hall meeting per party per state. Another suggestion is that the EC should provide door delivery of party and candidates’ manifestos to every house at government expense. These deserve consideration with a view to reduce monopoly of big parties and huge expenditures while also attempting to create a level-playing field for candidates and parties and at same time ensure a faster election process.(The writer is a senior journalist)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/such-a-long-wait-after-poll-frenzy/articleshow/81983748.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||All for MSP: Crop from Bihar, UP smuggled into Bathinda||Bathinda: A day before the start of the wheat procurement in the state, Bathinda market committee authorities detected a large quantity of wheat arriving in Bathinda allegedly in illegal manner. The authorities impounded three trucks loaded with wheat bags, apart from some wheat unloaded in the Bathinda grain market. In all, over 12,000 such bags were found in Bathinda. A case under various sections has been registered against two commission agent firms. The police are making further investigations about whether more trucks were to arrive and from where the wheat was loaded. During the previous paddy procurement season too, such practice was detected wherein paddy purchased at low prices from Bihar and UP was brought in large quantities to be sold in Punjab at minimum support price (MSP). Sources said the latest wheat consignment was brought from UP and Rajasthan to be sold at the MSP in Punjab. The trucks were seen by some residents in the wee hours of Friday, who informed the market committee officials about it. Soon, some activists of farmer organisations also reached the Bathinda grain market and demanded stern action against those brought the wheat from outside. Bathinda district mandi officer Preet Kanwar said, “We have detected over 12,000 bags of wheat in total from three trucks and unloaded in the grain market. These were brought by a commission agent firm and a factory owner.” Bathinda senior superintendent of police Bhupinderjit Singh Virk said a case for cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy had been registered against two firms, Babu Ram Ashok Kumar and Luxmi oil mills.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/all-for-msp-crop-from-bihar-up-smuggled-into-bathinda/articleshow/81995246.cms||---
---||Pune||Last-minute purchase of essentials spikes ahead of weekend lockdown||Pune: With confusion over if people would be allowed to visit shops in their neighbourhood and if the essential shops would remain open or have enough stock, many residents went for panic-buying ahead of the weekend lockdown in the city.Monaji Hacharam, a grocery shop owner, said, “There was more than usual rush at the shop with customers purchasing extra bread, milk, and so on, even though I informed them that I will keep the shop open during the weekend as per the timings issued by the government. I had to tell some customers not to purchase in bulk so there would be some stock for others too.”Katraj resident Ranjan Puthina said that some grocery shops in his area charged more than the maximum retail price (MRP) of some products . “Shops were charging Rs50 over the MRP for cigarettes. Last year, they were charging double the price, sometimes even more. Customers agreed to pay extra because we are not sure whether the lockdown will continue and develop into a situation like last year, so it’s better to stock up now.”Grocery shops, bakeries and dairies were running out of stock much before the 6pm closing deadline.Karim Shaikh, a bakery shop employee, said, “We ran out of pao, buns, dinner rolls, pizza bread and brown bread by 3pm. Many customers, who came in later, were disappointed. They had to make do with regular sandwich bread. We have not yet decided whether we will open the shop tomorrow and day after.”Anoop Ghatkope, a resident of Kondhwa, said, “I visited three dairy outlets in the area at 4pm to buy paneer but could not get any. To my surprise, they had also run out of milk, only products like curd and buttermilk were available.”Many meat shops in the city had also run out of stock by the end of the day. Farid Khan, a resident of Fatimanagar, said, “There was a huge rush at the chicken shops today. I was worried about waiting for my turn with no social distancing norms being followed. Many meat shops in the area closed much before 6pm, probably because they ran out of stock for the day.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/last-minute-purchase-of-essentials-spikes-ahead-of-weekend-lockdown/articleshow/81995243.cms||---

The businessman, Mukesh Doshi, through his company Sunlight Housing Development Private Ltd, had allegedly purchased properties for Rs 78 crore, but through a series of layered transactions, involving shell companies. The money was allegedly laundered back to Doshi in a matter of hours. The attached assets include five commercial properties totalling an area of 32,300 square feet in Kaledonia building, Andheri (East), and two residential flats of 3,960 square feet each in Atlantis Building, Andheri (West), as well as Rs 1.4 crore in moveable properties. ED initiated an investigation on the basis of an FIR registered by CBI for siphoning off of a Rs 200 crore loan sanctioned by Yes Bank to one Mack Star Marketing Pvt Ltd, for a “fictitious purpose”. Earlier, ED has already initiated an investigation against HDIL, its directors Rakesh Wadhawan and Sarang Wadhawan, and Joy Thomas, who was CMD of PMC Bank and others on the basis of an FIR registered by Mumbai Police’s Economic Offences Wing. Mack Star Marketing, managed by the Wadhawans, had constructed a commercial building, Kaledonia, as a sale component in a slum rehabilitation scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bizmans-rs-78cr-property-attached-in-wadhawan-case/articleshow/81996005.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Goa||Roadwork at Merces circle puts motorists in a fix with only one lane open for traffic||Panaji: Fresh roadworks taken up on the stretch from the Merces circle till the road parallel to the Atal Setu bridge have put motorists under duress in peak summer. Owing to nearly half of the road being dug up while vehicles simultaneously pass by, only a single lane of the road is accessible for vehicle to pass through. However, these are vehicles heading towards Panaji from the Old Goa bypass road, Merces, Santa Cruz and Bambolim leading to a massive bottleneck at the Merces circle during peak hours. “With two-wheelers, four-wheelers, buses and sometimes even trucks rushing in simultaneously to pass through the single lane, the bottleneck creates dangerous potential for vehicles colliding against one another. Even a single accident is enough on this road to block the area and further create congestion,” a resident of Merces said. The most amount of traffic rush was seen in the morning as motorists attempted to compete with one another to make it through the single lane in a bid to reach their respective workplace on time. Sources from the PWD said that the work will go on for a few weeks owing to which the situation is likely to persist for a while. They, however, failed to point out to even a tentative date as to when the works would be completed. PWD engineers in charge along with an MVR consultant had held an inspection of the area on Friday along with the traffic police to gauge the situation. Deputy superintendent of traffic police, North Goa, Salim Shaikh said that there is no scope for decongestion as of now. “During peak hours, only one vehicle at a time can pass through the open lane. We have been watching the situation and have deputed addition staff besides placing barricades. Since there is the bridge on one side and a traffic island on the other, there is no scope to do much until the works are complete,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/roadwork-at-merces-circle-puts-motorists-in-a-fix-with-only-one-lane-open-for-traffic/articleshow/81996009.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||MLA booked for villagers’ oath to vote TRS in Nagarjuna Sagar bypoll||HYDERABAD: Taking a serious view of some politicians administering oath to villagers to vote for a particular political party in the Nagarjuna Sagar bypolls, the Election Commission of India (ECI) has asked cops to register cases against them. Police on Thursday booked a case against Mahabubabad MLA B Shankar Naik for allegedly administering oath to the villagers of Satyampadu thanda in Tripuraram mandal that they would vote for TRS candidate Nomula Bhagat. An MLC and local Rythu Bandhu Samithi president were also present at the meeting. “After it came to our notice we asked police to book a case against those who administered the oath. We are keeping a close watch on such incidents. Both the district administration and police are creating awareness among locals,” returning officer B Rohith Singh told TOI on Friday. Shankar Naik, however, said they were not forcing anybody to vote for his party candidate. “Since almost all sections of society have been getting various benefits in the form of welfare schemes, villagers are voluntarily coming forward to vote for the TRS,” Naik said. At many places, parties are allegedly influencing locals through gram panchayat sarpanches to take a pledge to vote for them, it is learnt. Similar incidents were reported from Bishya thanda and Buddi thanda in the constituency. In some hamlets, the oath was administered on their local goddesses’ names. However, the election authorities said they have not received any complaint on administering oath to the villagers except the incident in Satyampadu. But this is not the first time that gram panchayats and villagers were found taking oath or villages adopting unanimous resolutions to vote for the ruling TRS. Several villages had passed such resolutions in the 2014, 2018 generation elections and even during the Dubbak bypoll last year. For instance, people of Veerareddypally, Udayapur, Gollapalli, Chodaripalem and Guvvalegi villages in Siddipet district had decided to support the TRS in Dubbak bypoll, which it eventually lost to the BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mla-booked-for-villagers-oath-to-vote-trs-in-nsagar-bypoll/articleshow/81996912.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Pune||PMC saddled with demand for more ventilation support||Pune: The demand for hospital beds with ventilator support for the treatment of Covid-19 patients continues to rise despite the civic administration claiming to have increased such facilities in its limits.Last week, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had 490 beds with ventilator support and the number increased to 551 on Friday. Not a single ventilator bed was, however, available on Friday. The patients in need of ventilator beds in the PMC limits were sent to hospitals in areas under the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation and the Pune rural administration. Officials said hospitals in those areas had 57 vacant ventilator beds. “Keeping in mind the high demand for the ventilator beds, we have urged the civic administration and the government to add more such facilities in the PMC limits. We hope to have more beds with ventilator support in the next couple of days,” Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol said.A senior PMC official said beds — the regular and also those with oxygen and ventilator support — were being arranged in association with private and government hospitals. “The administration has planned to take over 100% beds in some private hospitals. The civic administration has already taken over six hospitals. Some more will be added in the days to come,” PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar said.He added that the PMC would also take over the ESI hospital at Satara road and convert it into a dedicated Covid-19 facility. “This will help us increase the total bed capacity by around 100,” he said. The Dakshin Maharashtra and Goa (DMG) Sub Area, which is the local military authority in Pune, has agreed to provide 40 beds at the Army Institute of Cardiothoracic Sciences (AICTS) for the civilian Covid-19 patients. Recently, district collector Rajesh Deshmukh had written to the DMG Sub Area commander Major General Inderjeet Singh requesting assistance in terms of ventilator-supported beds at the AICTS. “We got 10 ventilator-supported and 10 oxygen beds at the AICTS on Thursday and will get the remaining beds soon at the same facility,” Deshmukh told TOI on Friday.The district administration had a meeting with senior army officers on Covid-19 situation and how both the agencies could work in tandem to effectively tackle the situation. A senior army officer said, “Our endeavour is to provide all assistance to civil authorities in this difficult time of pandemic. Last year, we had reserved 10 ICU beds at AICTS for civil Covid patients. This time also we have made a similar commitment. After a few days, we will again have discussions with the administration and based on the Covid 19 situation, we would allocate more beds at our facility.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-saddled-with-demand-for-more-ventilation-support/articleshow/81995253.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Pune||Unassembled ventilators delaying distribution: Tope||Pune: Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Friday said unassembled ventilators sent by the Centre to the state were delaying distribution of the machines in the districts. “The Centre has sent around 1,000 ventilators made by various companies. All the machines are unassembled. After being assembled, some machines are even non-functional. There is no point in sending ventilators that will not function. Most districts in the state are demanding ventilators,” he said. During an interaction with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had sought 1,200 more ventilators for the state on the grounds that the existing ones were either to be assembled or repaired. As on Thursday, 40% of the beds with ventilator support were occupied. A state health official said they were getting nearly 200 calls from all districts requesting for ventilators. “What is the point in sending such unassembled ventilators? We have to reach out to the companies to send people for assembling the machines. This is delaying the entire process,” he said. “Haffkine Bio-Pharmaceutical Corporation Limited has even written to companies supplying the ventilators that many machines are not functioning,” another health official said. Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol has also written to the health minister, Tope, and Union minister Prakash Javadekar, urging them to transfer ventilator beds from states where the Covid-19 situation was under control. Minister seeks funds under NUHM State health minister Rajesh Tope has sought central funds under the National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) for filling the vacant posts in the health department. He told TOI that the stated needed to fill the posts because ensuring enough manpower for tackling the Covid-19 situation was important.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/unassembled-ventilators-delaying-distribution-tope/articleshow/81995262.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Mumbai||Sharad Pawar says NCP ministers ‘failed to back Anil Deshmukh’||MUMBAI: NCP president Sharad Pawar on Friday spoke in a meeting with party leaders about the “failure” of NCP cabinet members to firmly stand by former home minister Anil Deshmukh, if a senior NCP cabinet member is to be believed. “Pawar felt that while baseless allegations were made against Deshmukh, his cabinet colleagues did not raise their voice before the media. Most of the reporting was one-sided. When the CBI starts its probe, all cabinet members will stand by Deshmukh,” the NCP cabinet member said. Pawar had a brief discussion with senior NCP leaders. “Pawar’s concern was serious. He felt that in the battle against a section of senior IPS officers, Deshmukh was fighting it alone,” the cabinet member said. The NCP minister said that the Bombay high court had no doubt ordered a CBI probe into Singh’s allegations and the apex court had upheld the HC order, but the state home department should examine the possibility of holding a departmental probe against the former Mumbai police chief. “We will take up the matter with the new home minister,” the cabinet member said. The NCP minister felt that it was wrong on the part of Deshmukh to approach the apex court against the HC order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pawar-says-ncp-ministers-failed-to-back-deshmukh/articleshow/81996916.cms||---

It was a 61% rise in cases in two days. The city also recorded the death of a positive patient every two hours with 12 deaths in 24 hours. It was the highest daily deaths for the city since November 30 when the city had recorded 13 deaths. The city doubled its death toll in two days. According to Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association(AHNA) website, the number of patients in private hospitals crossed 4,000 on Friday. AHNA has 4,815 beds available, giving 85% occupancy, said officials. “The exponential rise in daily cases in cities such as Ahmedabad and Surat are attributed to various factors ranging from higher testing rate compared to other parts of the state to higher population density and movement of citizens. But the next few days would be very crucial to decide on pace of the pandemic,” said a city-based critical care specialist. Meanwhile, Civil Hospital on Friday launched helpline numbers (9409766908 / 9409776264) for relatives of the admitted patients. The officials said that the relatives can contact volunteers for updates on health of patients and also seek assistance. In association with district administration, a new dome for relatives will be constructed at the new hospital in Manjushree Mill compound, said officials. “As of Friday evening, the 1200-bed hospital had 887 patients out of which 281 were on ventilator or BiPAP,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-records-61-rise-in-daily-cases-in-2-days-deaths-doubled/articleshow/81995287.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Local leaders want defector’s name removed from book||Kolkata: Now that Rabindranath Bhattacharya has shifted to BJP and thrown a challenge to his former party (Trinamool) this election, questions have been raised over the narrative of the 10-page chapter on the Singur movement in Class VIII history book, where Bhattacharya has been named as one of the key architects of the agitation. With Bhattacharya now contesting against his former party, which had prevented the setting up of a car-manufacturing plant on a 1,000-acre land in Singur, several local Trinamool leaders want his name to be removed from the history chapter as, they claimed, he no longer believed in the same ideology. But state education minister Partha Chatterjee said, “People’s ideologies may change with convenience. But history cannot. So, his name will continue to remain in the book.” Now determined to woo industry back to Singur, Bhattacharya said, “What has been done cannot be undone. I cannot ignore being part of the movement that time. But if BJP comes to power, I will strive to bring back industry on Singur land that now lies barren and useless.” A senior education official said, “We work on instructions from the government. If the new government wants to bring in any alterations, it will be done.” —Inputs by Somdatta Basu||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/local-leaders-want-defectors-name-removed-from-book/articleshow/81995273.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Delhi||AAP: Shortage of vax, but Centre exporting it||New Delhi: AAP member of the Delhi assembly Raghav Chadha said on Friday that the shortage of Covid vaccine was a major concern when Covid-19 had the country in its grip. Unless sufficient supply was made possible, the vaccination drive would come to an unfortunate halt, he added. “Some states have doses in stock for just a day, two days, maximum of four days. Some do not have any vaccine stock left. Some states have even shut down their vaccination centres due to the shortage of the vaccine,” Chadha said at a press conference. “In a nutshell, this means that five days from now, nearly all states will have zero vaccine doses with them, putting a stop to the vaccination drive unless supply is resumed.” Chadha claimed that as many as 109 vaccination centres in Pune, 26 in Mumbai and 700 in Odisha were closed down due to deficiency in the vaccine. Even in Uttar Pradesh, some vaccine centres had to be shut down because of inadequate doses. “The central government has exported as many as 64.5 million doses to 84 countries, while we are facing a scarcity in our country. The export number is given on the official website of the Ministry of External Affairs,” Chadha pointed out. Citing the Centre’s declaration that it would export 45 million doses to Pakistan, Chadha countered, “I would like to ask the Centre which is important, vaccinating Indians or inoculating Pakistanis?” Once India’s population was fully vaccinated, only then should the Centre export the vaccine, he added. In a separate conference, party MLA Atishi claimed that in the meeting with the Delhi chief minister on Thursday, PM Narendra Modi approved Kejriwal's anti-pandemic model. Atishi added that Delhi government conducted one lakh of the 13 lakh tests carried out daily in India. “The PM has recommended the model comprising home isolation, aggressive testing and micro containment zones to deal with Covid across the country,” she said. “The Union home minister rejected Delhi's move on home isolation last year, but now the PM is promoting it.” LG Anil Baijal, representative of the Centre, had halted home isolation last year and made five days’ institutional quarantine of positive individuals mandatory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-shortage-of-vax-but-centre-exporting-it/articleshow/81997429.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Besides, as many as 7,842 patients recovered in the region in the past 24 hours. The Pune municipal areas added 5,647 cases against 4,587 recoveries in the last 24 hours. The Pimpri Chinchwad and rural parts reported 2,009 and 2,369 new infections, respectively. The total positive caseload increased above 6.26 lakh on Friday, while its discharges surged above 5.24 lakh. The region has reported daily additions of over 10,000 patients since the last few days. Increase in testing has been major a reason behind the rise in caseload. Health experts have said time and again that testing and contact tracing were vital to check the Covid spread. Acting on this, the state health authorities have ramped up testing over the last one-and-a-half month. In PMR especially, the numbers of tests per day have risen five-fold since early February. The PMC tested 27,986 samples on Friday, while the PCMC and rural areas conducted 8,169and 6,878 tests, respectively. The region has so far checked over 31.96 lakh samples, of which over 16.71 lakh tests have been conducted in the PMC limits alone. A report released by the district health officer, Bhagwan Pawar, stated that 69 patients succumbed to the infection in the region on Friday. Of these, 44 deaths were reported in the PMC limits, 17 in the PCMC areas and eight in the rural parts of PMR. With this, the region’s death tally has increased to 10,541. The DHO’s report stated that active caseload in PMR increased to 91,712 on Friday evening. As many as 69,881 patients were in home isolation, while 21,831 patients were being treated at various hospitals, the report added. With the cases rising over the past one month, experts have advised people to abide by the Covid norms and wear mask while venturing out to beat the contagion. “Social distancing is a must to keep the virus at bay,”a health expert said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tests-stay-above-43k-in-pmr-over-10k-turn-ve/articleshow/81995263.cms||Sarang Dastane

The two went there from Bandra in a taxi and began clicking pictures after one of them climbed the bridge’s cable. A court granted bail to them. Maqsim Shcherbakov (24) climbed onto the cable, while Vasili Kolesenikov (30) took his photos. A passerby spotted them and alerted the police control room, who informed Worli police. They stated that they were stuntmen and have been performing stunts in circuses. They said they had been to various Indian cities, and came from Goa two to three weeks back. They have earlier been to Delhi and Dubai. Police checked their mobile phones and social media accounts to find their photos. “While checking their phones we found that one of them had performed stunts in Dubai too. He performed stunts on highrisees,” said a senior officer. Police also found that their tourist visas had expired. They were booked under sections of Indian Penal Code and Foreigners’ Act.

Talera hospital was one of them.”The officials from the SGH confirmed that they were conducting at least 3,500 rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests daily in their lab for the past three-four days.Harshad Jadhav, an employee at a private firm from Old Sangvi, was asked by his employer to get the RT-PCR report as mandated by the state government. Jadhav said he had undergone a rapid antigen test at YCMH earlier this week. But there was no clarity on whether the RAT negative report would be applicable or not then. So, his employer told him to get the RT-PCR done, he added.Prashant Girbane, director-general, Mahratta chamber of commerce, industries and agriculture (MCCIA), said, “Most industries are concerned about the unavailability of rapid antigen test facilities and overwhelmed RT-PCR facilities. The testing labs are giving delayed appointments for swab collection from homes/factories. This is a huge supply constraint and the industrial workers are anxious about their travel to/from the factory as they anticipate harassment for not having RT-PCR test done.”Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil told TOI, “Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar would chair a Covid-19 review meeting on Saturday. We shall see if the issue gets any resolution there. We shall think about the industries’ demand with a soft corner. The whole thing would take at least a week to get streamlined.”(With inputs from Shiladitya Pandit)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/private-firms-employees-throng-labs-for-covid-negative-report/articleshow/81995266.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Hyderabad||HCA row: Telangana HC bats for ex-SC judge Verma as ombudsman||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court has upheld the appointment of Justice Deepak Verma, a retired judge of the Supreme Court, as ombudsman-cum-ethics officer of Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA). Giving a categorical ruling that HCA secretary R Vijayanand had connived with Budding Star Cricket Club (BSCC), a local cricket club, to stall the appointment of ombudsman-cum-ethics officer, Justice MS Ramachandra Rao directed BSCC and Vijayanand to pay Rs 25,000 to Charminar Cricket Club (CCC) towards legal costs after the latter approached the high court with a civil revision plea. Justice Ramachandra Rao in his judgment said Vijayanand was a party to the June 6, 2020, meeting of the apex council of HCA which had decided to appoint Justice Verma as ombudsman. Later, Vijayanand tried to sabotage this decision by furnishing false information that the apex council had opposed the appointment before a civil court in Hyderabad. Setting aside the civil court order, the judge said HCA president Mohammed Azharuddin was sidelined by the secretary and other members of the apex council. Stating that continuation of the case before the civil court would further frustrate the cause of HCA and embarrass the ombudsman, Justice Rao dismissed the petition pending before the civil court. Vedula Srinivas, counsel for the CCC, alleged that the petition before the civil court was filed at the behest of the HCA secretary who did not want scrutiny of HCA accounts or actions by the ombudsman. “Vijayanand does not want the appointment of an ombudsman since he owns as many as eight cricket clubs. HCA treasurer Surender Agarwal and member Syed Moizuddin own four cricket clubs each. As per the new norms, they become ineligible to hold any posts in the HCA. They connived and set up the BSCC to challenge the appointment of Justice Verma before the civil court,” the petitioner alleged. Earlier, following a petition by the BSCC, the civil court had suspended the appointment of Justice Verma on the grounds that his appointment was made without obtaining the opinion of the annual general body meeting consisting of all the members of the HCA. Local cricket clubs are members of the HCA. Aggrieved by the suspension order which prevented Justice Verma from functioning as ombudsman, CCC moved the high court. The emergence of ombudsman was the result of recommendations made by Justice RM Lodha, who made far-reaching recommendations to rid cricket bodies across the country of many ills associated with them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hca-row-hc-bats-for-ex-sc-judge-verma-as-ombudsman/articleshow/81996918.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Online pal dupes businessman of Rs 10 lakh in pre-owned car deal||PUNE: The anti-extortion cell of the city police is investigating a complaint lodged by a businessman alleging that his friend — whom he met online — offered to sell him a used BMW car and duped him of Rs10 lakh. As per the complaint lodged by the Baramati garments trader — Tushar Lokhande (33) — the “friend” took Rs10 lakh from him for a used BMW X5 SUV on October 7. However, when he got neither the vehicle nor his money back, Lokhande submitted a complaint application with the crime branch recently. After a preliminary inquiry, the crime branch registered an FIR with the Hadapsar police, inspector Balaji Pandhare said. Further, a month-and-a-half ago, the suspect was arrested in a similar case and released on bail, police said. “The complainant, Tushar Lokhande (33), became acquainted with a man, who claimed to be in the business of selling used cars, on a social networking site three years ago. They became close friends and met each other multiple times,” Pandhare said on Friday. Last year, Lokhande was looking to purchase a used BMW car. “The suspect told him he could sell him such a vehicle for around Rs15 lakh. He showed the complainant a photo of the SUV, but not the actual vehicle,” Pandhare said. After some negotiation, the suspect agreed to sell the vehicle for Rs10 lakh. “On October 7, he collected the money but did not deliver the SUV. He also did not return the money,” he said. Despite multiple requests, police said the suspect delayed handing over the possession of the vehicle to Lokhande. “Eventually, Lokhande realised his friend had cheated him and asked for his money back. The suspect sought time to refund the money, but then switched off his number and became untraceable,” Pandhare said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/online-pal-dupes-bizman-of-rs-10l-in-pre-owned-car-deal/articleshow/81995271.cms||Asseem Shaikh

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Touts offer tickets to UP at 5 times the actual fare’||Mumbai: Munnalal Giri has been trying for a ticket on any train passing through Auraiya district in Uttar Pradesh ever since Maharashtra announced its mini-lockdown this week, with no success. With confirmed tickets already booked in advance, he had no choice but to turn to a tout. “Touts are offering train tickets to UP at almost five times the rate. The price is usually around Rs 450, but it is being sold at Rs 2,200,” said Giri. He works as a loader of wood and metal equipment at a shop in Ghatkopar’s Asalpha area. “The seth will shut the shop. Then where will I go and how will I earn?” he asks.Maharashtra’s pandemic curbs coincided with travel for harvest season in UP and the gram panchayat polls which begin mid-April. As a result, many migrants had already booked advance train tickets. Now, with shops, restaurants and markets closing, the demand for tickets from migrants desperate to return home has spiked even more. With just Rs 1,000 left in his pocket, Giri couldn’t afford the tout and plans to travel ticketless. “If I am caught, the fine will be less than the money charged by the tout,” he reasons.However, with the Central Railway barring the sale of platform tickets at key stations for out-bound trains on Friday, the chances of ticketless travel have dimmed. The railways took the step to prevent crowding. Central railway officials also said more trains do run in the summer but only those with confirmed tickets will be allowed to board.Mahboob Khan, a tailor from Jarimari in Saki Naka, said the rates being charged for tatkal tickets has also skyrocketed. “The agents are charging Rs 3,500 for a tatkal ticket on UP trains,” he said. Khan works in a garment factory and is not sure how long it will stay open. During the national lockdown in 2020, he had shelled out Rs 3,000 to get to his home-town in UP’s Basti district in a packed lorry. “I only managed to leave Mumbai in May and faced a very difficult time. I had barely any money and had to fend for myself,” he said.Those working with migrant workers say they fear a more extended lockdown or stricter curbs in future. “As the days pass, we are getting more queries from migrants wanting to leave.

People should not take it personally if the police seek some information or ask them to show documents to justify their movement during the lockdown. Police would ask for such documents only as a part of discharging their duty for people’s own good.”He advised people not to venture out on roads without reason and help the administration in containing the spread of coronavirus. He said some establishments offering emergency services would remain open, while the others would remain close.He sought support from the public at large to adhere to the guidelines and help the administration break the chain of the virus.

---||Nagpur||Covid-19 patients’ ‘dangerous’ behaviour putting others at risk: HC||Nagpur: Expressing concern over Covid-19 patients’ “reckless and dangerous” behaviour at Covid Care Centres (CCCs) like MLA Hostel, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high Court noted that it was putting others’ lives at risk. A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote said those entrusted with the duty at these centres have started contracting the deadly disease, due to irresponsible conduct by such patients. “One of the PWD engineers has contracted the virus thrice in less than a year while an executive engineer, in-charge of MLA Hostel, has caught the infection twice. Such behaviour of quarantined patients is highly deplorable and needs to be dealt with in a very stringent manner.” Quoting various reports, the bench added that at such CCCs, the quarantined patients are seen leaving their respective rooms and roaming freely in corridors and also at open spaces/lounges. “We, therefore, direct the collector to take immediate steps for keeping quarantined patients in strict isolation of degree prescribed under applicable rules/regulations/SOP. If those provisions aren’t there, we direct the ‘Nagpur Covid-19 Committee’ to frame and bring them in force immediately.” Flaying the police constables deployed at CCCs for not performing their duties diligently, the judges asked the police commissioner and superintendent of police, Nagpur (Rural) to ensure that their personnel should refrain themselves from using smart phones for entertainment and recreation while on duty and to initiate stern action if found guilty of dereliction. “These constables, deployed for preventing patients from coming out of the respective rooms and also reporting breaches of conduct committed by them to the authorities, remain engaged and engrossed all the time in their smart phones. The CP and SP should ensure that the personnel deputed at all CCCs, within and without city limits, diligently and sincerely perform their duty.” Directing the respondents to install CCTVs inside corridors or at suitable places of all institutional quarantine centres, the judges asked them to fund these expenses from the exchequer. “There’s a need to have electronic surveillance for checking patients’ movements. The proposals in this regard would be prepared by the collector, the NMC commissioner and other heads of the department looking after such centres, and send them to the state or central governments for early sanction, preferably within ten days.” The HC directed ‘Nagpur Covid-19 Committee’ to devise a method for regular inspection of all institutional quarantine centres by an appropriate team with a mandate to take action then and there. Complete recruitment process before June 30 for new Covid beds: HC to AIIMS The HC directed assistant solicitor general (ASGI) Ulhas Aurangabadkar to complete the process of sanctioning new staff and their recruitment for adding new Covid-19 beds to AIIMS before June 30. The directives came after the ASGI informed that very soon the proposal of creation of additional posts at AIIMS will be sanctioned by the Union Health Ministry and recruitment would commence soon. He also informed that the contractor, who is entrusted with the construction work at AIIMS, has assured that the entire construction work of three wards would be completed and all deficiencies would be removed latest by April 30. MADC informed that it would issue a provisional NOC and Occupancy Certificate (OC) for these wards within a week, subject to the condition that within a month’s time all the deficiencies at the site are removed and necessary clearance from MPCB is obtained. “We request the MADC to issue provisional NOC and OC within seven days subject to the condition that within 30 days, all the deficiencies are removed and necessary clearance from MPCB is obtained by AIIMS. In case of failure both NOC and OC would stand lapsed, unless the timeline is extended by HC for just and proper reasons,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-19-patients-dangerous-behaviour-putting-others-at-risk-hc/articleshow/81995283.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The daily requirement of remdesivir in Pune district has gone up to almost 11,000 vials.“In addition to the state's daily allocation of 7,500 vials, we sourced another 1,000 vials of remdesivir from the state-run district hospital in Sangli for patients undergoing treatment at the PMC-run jumbo hospital on the CoEP premises. This exercise eased out the tension to a great extent on Friday. We plan to get such unused vials from other adjoining districts too,” said S B Patil, joint commissioner (drugs), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pune. The state government allotted Pune district 14.69% (almost 15%) of the share of remdesivir vials it gets from four pharma companies. This is the primary reason for the spiralling shortage of the drug in Pune. Currently, the state has started getting 50,000 vials of the intravenous drug. Medical expert Siddharth Dhende, who runs a small hospital in Yerawada, said, “I got 20 vials. I hope there would no hindrance henceforth.” Sanjay Patil, chairman of Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India, Pune branch, said, “The shortage seemed to have eased out a bit on Friday. But it is a mixed picture.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fda-sources-unused-vials-from-other-dists-to-address-shortage/articleshow/81995278.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Complainant Mohan Dhone stated in his FIR that his friend had admitted to the crime and returned one of the stolen articles -- a silver idol worth Rs1,500. Sub-inspector Sadashiv Gaikwad of the Loni Kalbhor police said, “Both Dhone and his friend, a vegetable vendor, are from the same town in Solapur district.” Gaikwad said, “On February 7 last year, the suspect took Dhone and his wife out for dinner at a restaurant in Urali Kanchan. He told them that he would return in some time with his children. The man returned in an hour with his son. When Dhone went home after dinner, he found his house burgled.” He said, “On checking the CCTV footage, Dhone found that his friend had entered his house using duplicate keys. His friend later admitted his involvement in the crime and returned the silver idol,” Gaikwad said. “Recently, the suspect stopped responding to Dhone’s calls.

The polymerase chain reaction step of the RT-PCR test uses special chemicals and a thermal cycler, which causes a reaction to occur that makes millions of copies of a small portion of SARS-CoV-2 virus’s genetic (DNA and RNA) material.Representatives of the laboratories said they needed more thermal cyclers but there was a huge demand-supply mismatch. “There is almost a 15-20 days’ waiting period for these machines. This is impacting the testing volume,’‘ said a representative.A private laboratory chain with 40 thermal cyclers can currently conduct 12,000 tests a day and has sought 40 more machines to scale up the daily testing volume up to 25,000. “Scaling up testing 10 times than the current volume is fine in a year. But it can’t be done in a month,” representative of the laboratory said. With the state government insisting on RT-PCR tests, there is a huge stress on laboratories. “Many corporates are reaching out to private laboratories for a tie-up. But it is getting very difficult to cater to the companies' demand along with the regular testing,” the representative said. A senior state health official said efforts would be made to redress the situation. A city-based senior microbiologist said most of the thermal cyclers were imported mainly from Germany and Korea. “A few Indian players have emerged recently. But still there is a shortage,” the microbiologist said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/laboratories-say-shortage-of-thermal-cyclers-a-big-hurdle-to-step-up-testing/articleshow/81995274.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The 26-year-old was Indian Super League’s most creative player last season but injuries in the seventh edition hampered his progress as Goa were knocked out in the semifinals on penalties by eventual champions Mumbai City FC. “Playing for FC Goa has always been special ever since I arrived here four years back. I feel at home here. Together we have been able to stitch together a lot of successful chapters over the past few years and I am looking forward to continuing in the same vein in the years to come,” said Brandon. Brandon joined Goa after being selected in the 2017 ISL draft. He had previously played for Mumbai from 2015-17. Brandon went on to become one of the vital players at Goa and helped them qualify for the ISL playoffs in each of the past four seasons. “I am convinced that the best days - both for me and the club -- lies ahead of us and I intend to start working towards that. Being a Goan, it gives me great pleasure to continue to wear this shirt and represent my people for many years to come,” said Brandon. For India, the midfielder has cemented his place as well with all three goals during the latest World Cup qualification campaign coming from his assists. “We’re delighted that Brandon has agreed to commit his long-term future to the club. He has grown leaps and bounds since he first arrived here in 2017 to turn into one of the most consistent creative forces in the country,” said FC Goa’s director of football Ravi Puskur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/brandon-signs-three-year-extension/articleshow/82009876.cms||---

The meeting ended within five minutes after technical glitches arose at the virtual meeting. However, Telangana went ahead seeking 33 tmcft of water from the KRMB to meet its irrigation and drinking water purposes. Telangana based its claim on the grounds that it has 80 tmcft balance share in Krishna waters for the current year and sought 33 tmcft from the reserves. The water resources department prepared an indent, which has been submitted to the KRMB for release of water for two months. Neighbour Andhra Pradesh has reportedly sought 7 tmcft from the Krishna for both irrigation and drinking water purposes. The KRMB was supposed to give the water release order for April and May to both Telugu states at its board meeting on Friday. While the virtual meeting did not happen due to technical glitches, sources said the meeting will be held at a later date. The water year begins from June 1 every year and concludes on May 31 next year. The meeting was supposed to be held through a video conference. According to official sources, KRMB member-secretary DM Raipure was supposed to take part from Delhi. Similarly, AP irrigation officials were supposed to attend from Amaravathi. The board is likely to meet next week. A senior water resources official told TOI, “Ayacut under Nagarjuna Sagar and Srisailam Left Bank Canal requires 25 tmcft and 4 tmcft is needed to meet drinking water requirements of Hyderabad. Another 4 tmcft is required for projects and drinking water needs in erstwhile Mahbubnagar district.” Official sources said AP had almost exhausted its share of 600 tmcft of a total of 900 tmcft in the Krishna. “AP is left with only a few tmcft of water as it has drawn 125 tmcft from Pothireddypadu head regulator, 150 tmcft from Handri Neeva Sujala Sravanthi project, 40 tmcft from KC Canal and 150 tmcft from Nagarjuna Sagar Right Bank Canal,” a senior Telangana official said. Sources said the water resources department will place facts and statistics before the KRMB while finalising water release order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tech-glitch-hits-krmb-meet-t-seeks-33-tmcft-from-krishna/articleshow/81996967.cms||Koride Mahesh

The drug’s emergency use authorization also demands liver and kidney function tests be carried out before intravenous administration among at-risk patients. It may cause liver toxicity in those with chronic liver diseases and since it’s mainly cleared via the kidneys, it should not be used in patients with poor renal function too. Gynaecologist Shilpa Naik, professor at BJ Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital, said remdesivir could be used with caution in pregnancy and lactation if criteria for compassionate use were met. Patients with underlying medical conditions also need to be administered the drug very carefully.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-advise-caution-on-using-remdesivir-among-breastfeeding-pregnant-women/articleshow/81995300.cms||Umesh Isalkar

School education minister, Varsha Gaikwad, said the government will take a decision on examinations in the next couple of days. An official said the two private IT firms that were consulted by the state education department have said it will take at least two years to set up the complete infrastructure. “The option of conducting online exams for classes X and XII seems difficult and non-viable,” said the official. HSC and SSC exams are scheduled to begin on April 23 and April 29. In light of the rising Covid-19 graph, former state school education minister and BJP MLA Ashish Shelar on Friday demanded the board exams be postponed. He told Gaikwad, who had called him for suggestions, that the exams could be conducted partly online and partly offline. “The government should not waste much time and take a decision immediately so that there is no anxiety among parents and students,” he said. Gaikwad in a video message said, “I’ve been holding consultations with student representatives, elected representatives from all parties, tech giants, parents, teachers and other sector experts regarding alternatives for assessment of HSC and SSC board students. I’d like to assure all students and parents that your safety is our foremost priority. We are reviewing the situation and a decision will be taken in the next few days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-online-board-exams-not-viable-option-this-year/articleshow/81996972.cms||---

The teachers, who are conducting these tests said that most students are not showing interest in taking tests or preparing for SSC board examinations, which are scheduled to be held from May 17. “I recently conducted a maths test. I informed students in advance about the deadline and asked them to send their answer scripts by the end of the day. Out of 17 students, only one student submitted the answer script,” said M Ravinder, maths teacher, Government High School, Nallakunta. Teachers said that students are citing various reasons such as non-availability of devices, internet, electricity among others for not submitting the test. Students said that the syllabus has not been completed. “Except for English, none of the subject syllabi is completed. Even if I want to write practice tests, more than half the questions are from the syllabus which is yet to be completed. How am I supposed to prepare and appear for exams without completion of syllabus,” questioned Y Swathi, class 10 student of a government school in the city. They said that even if they appear for the board exams, they will hardly be able to attempt enough to get pass marks. Students said the state should instead pass them all like last year or postpone the exams and conduct them after completing the entire syllabus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/class-10-students-skip-practice-tests/articleshow/81995306.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The city is also likely to get light rain with thunderstorm on April 13 and 14. For the last two days, the city has been experiencing cloudy condition with warmer nights. On Thursday, the cloudy condition prevailed from the late morning hours till the evening. As a result, there was a massive drop in the maximum temperature. The city experienced cloudy conditions, mostly in the afternoon hours on Friday as well. The Shivajinagar and Lohegaon observatories recorded 37.7°C and 38.2°C, which were above normal by 0.5°C and 0.2°C, respectively. The met department has recorded an increase in minimum temperature too. Shivajinagar and Lohegaon recorded 20°C and 21.1°C, which were above normal by 1.3°C and 1.1°C, respectively. Anupam Kashyapi, head of the weather forecast division of IMD Pune, said, “There is trough line from Vidarbha region to South Tamil Nadu. There is wind discontinuity over the southern part of Maharashtra and the formation of upper air circulation, off South Tamil Nadu region. These three factors have created a massive impact on weather conditions across the state, including Pune district.” As a result, the city would mostly experience cloudy conditions for the next four to five days, he said. “From April 12 onwards, this condition would intensity further. On April 13 and 14, the chance of light rain with thunderstorms can not be ruled out over the city. The maximum temperatures would mostly remain in the 38-39°C range, while minimum temperature would remain in the 19-20°C bracket,” Kashyapi added. The present weather condition would have a massive impact on Marathwada and Vidarbha regions in the coming days, a met official said. “From April 11, Marathwada is expected to experience gusty windy conditions with speed in the range of 30 to 40km per hour, with thunderstorms and lightning. The chance of hailstorms over the Vidharbha region can’t be ruled out,” an IMD official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/overcast-conditions-to-prevail-till-april-15-imd/articleshow/81995296.cms||Sandip Dighe

---||Delhi||Covid-19 in Delhi: No shutdown, enforce preventive norms, traders plan to request govt||NEW DELHI: Fearing a lockdown in some markets or curtailing of operational hours, traders’ associations of 12 prominent bazars called a joint virtual meeting on Friday evening. The traders’ bodies argued that the government should increase enforcement, impose challans or take other strict measures to implement norms rather than shutting down the economy, and have decided to approach lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and Delhi government over the issue. Representatives of Connaught Place, Karol Bagh, Chandni Chowk, Janpath, Khan Market, South Extension Part 1 &2, Aurobindo Market, Green Park, Lajpat Nagar, and Greater Kailash were present at the meeting. Sanjiv Mehra of Khan Traders Market Association said that traders have been facing major losses for the past year. “We decided to give a presentation to the LG and Delhi government before any decision is taken,” he said. “We believe that implementing a curfew is not a good idea, as it has a direct impact on customer sentiments. Therefore, we suggest stricter enforcement of Covid protocol during the day instead of restrictions during the night,” Sanjeev Madan, president, Traders Association Lajpat Nagar. Traders also blamed squatters and hawkers of flouting the norms. “Hawkers are following no protocols with regard to wearing masks, sanitisation and social distancing. Since they sit in small spaces, customers often forget to maintain social distance and gather in groups around them, increasing chances of spreading of infection. We have pointed out the matter several times with civic bodies and the LG office, but no action is taken,” said Atul Bhargava, president, New Delhi Traders Association. Sanjay Bhargava of Chandni Chowk Vyapar Mandal also pointed out that hawkers encroach upon areas like the sides of Chandni Chowk Metro station and Sadar Bazar’s pavements. “There is a need to understand the reason for congestion rather than simply shutting markets,” he said. “Reducing the working hours or downing shutters will force people to shut their business. The retail markets will seek time from LG to present our side,” Murli Mani, president, Karol Bagh Market. “Many businesses were forced to shut last year due to major setbacks in the wake of the pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-shutdown-enforce-preventive-norms-traders-plan-to-request-govt/articleshow/81997471.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Ahmedabad||Oxygen re-fillers to function 24x7||Ahmedabad: An age-old clause that restricts oxygen re-fillers to function between “sunrise and sunset” has been withdrawn, now allowing them to function 24x7. In the Union-state Covid coordination meeting held via video conferencing on Friday, Gujarat government claimed that the rule set by Centre’s petroleum and explosives safety organisation (PESO) was a major impediment for oxygen re-fillers and on its suggestion the clause was removed for all states. Gujarat was getting desperate as in past 5 days the demand for oxygen went up from 336 metric tonnes to 472 metric tonnes a day. “Gujarat has seven major oxygen producers which have a combined capacity of 1,100 metric tonnes and we are well placed right now with 64 major oxygen re-fillers,” assured FDCA commisioner H G Koshia. While a major policy decision has been taken at the top, the re-fillers and distributors on ground are finding it tough to meet the surge in demand. Logistics issues ranging from getting transport to supply hospitals, labour to work two shifts and lack of information of the actual number empty cyclinders in circulation, are major barriers to setting up smooth supply, said a senior AMC official. In Ahmedabad, even as the municipal corporation continues to requisition mid-size hospitals and nursing homes for Covid care, a large problem awaits them in logistics — that is transporting cylinders to these locations. Most of these hospitals rely on oxygen cylinders. Almost 95% of the hospitals — that is 947 hospitals of the 985 registered within the AMC limits — have a capacity of 40 beds or less. Their total bed capacity adds up to 9,245 beds. Of these 947 hospitals, a large number, that is 688 hospitals, have below 10 beds. The total combined bed capacity of below-10 bed hospital is 4,658. One can gauge the stress. On usual days, the average requirement of the below 30-bed hospitals was 9 to 10 cylinders for 6 to 8 ICU beds. Now, as more hospitals among these mid-size hospitals sign up as Covid care centres, there is a surge in demand for oxygen cylinders — seven times higher than on usual days. On the supplier’s side, oxygen dealers have told AMC that they don’t have much labour to spare (as labourer’s don’t work beyond 10pm) for filing, loading cylinders. Dealers are also finding it tough for finding commercial vehicles for transporting them to various parts of the city. BOX 1 (MAILED) Challenges faced *In five days, oxygen demand jumps from 336 metric tonnes to 472 metric tonnes a day *In Ahmedabad a large number of below-20 bed hospitals, including nursing homes are dependent on oxygen cylinders *The demand for oxygen cylinders have increased seven times among mid -size hospitals requsitioned for Covid care *About 95% of the hospitals in Ahmedabad have a bed capacity of 40 and less BOX2 Bed stats Bed availability among private and trust-run hospitals within AMC limits Beds Number of hospitals Total bed capacity More than 100 10 2,330 50-10 15 862 40-50 12 541 30-40 9 295 20-30 71 1,628 10-20 179 2,664 Below 10 688 4,658||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/oxygen-re-fillers-to-function-24x7/articleshow/81995336.cms||---

Speaking to reporters, railway board CEO and chairman, Suneet Sharma, said all zones were ready and they could start more train services as and when there was additional demand. He said there was “no cause for alarm” and people should not believe misinformation or speculative information. Sharma also said there was no demand from the Maharashtra government to reduce the number of express and suburban trains.The railway board chief also ruled out the requirement for a Coivd-19 negative certificate to travel by trains. Responding to speculation of huge rush at railway stations in the Mumbai region, railway officials said they ran 168 trains between March 29 and April 7 in which 12.2 lakh passengers travelled, which is 90% of occupancy. The railways will run 177 trains between April 8 and 17, and the current booking of tickets is barely 8.5 lakh, which is 60% occupancy.“So, there is nothing to suggest there is extraordinary demand. Usually, more people travel by train during the summer months as they go to their native places,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/rlys-rules-out-curtailing-train-services-amid-covid-case-spike/articleshow/81996187.cms||---

Nearly 80% of the employees work on the shop floor, manufacturing ammunition for the Indian armed forces and para-military forces. “Vaccination of these employees needs to be done on priority to dispel their fears, enhance their morale and ensure that they are protected against the virus so that the production and supply lines to the armed forces and para-military forces remains uninterrupted/unaffected. Since AFK is rendering essential defence services, adequate prevention through 100% inoculation needs to be provided to the employees by way of vaccinating them on preferential basis at par with the frontline workers,” the letter states. Pune, Khadki and Dehu Road cantonments too have approached the district administration for more doses to expedite the vaccination drive in their limits. Deshmukh said, “We will discuss the AFK’s demand and take a call on the same soon. As for the demand by the cantonment boards, we are facing a shortage of vaccine for the last few days. The vaccination drive is being carried out as per government policy. Our endeavour is to provide adequate doses across the district.” According to the district administration records, 6,725, 3,574 and 1,215 people have been vaccinated across Pune, Khadki and Dehu road cantonments since January 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/afk-3-cantts-seek-extra-supply-of-vaccines/articleshow/81995341.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Pune||Drive to resume today as Pune district gets 1 lakh dose boost||PUNE: The district received one lakh Covid-19 vaccine doses on Friday, the day when all the immunisation sites in the Pimpri Chinchwad areas remained shut due to the limited stock, while most of the sites in the rural parts wrapped up the drive in the afternoon. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “The Pune district has received around 1 lakh doses on Friday evening, of which 50,000 have been allocated to Pune rural, 30,000 to Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), and 20,000 to Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC). With this, vaccination will resume at all the designated sites on Saturday and Sunday.” Deshmukh, however, said they had demanded 2.5 lakh Covishield doses, of which 1 lakh had been allotted and they were expecting to get the remaining ones by Monday. The vaccine situation turned so grim on Friday that the 80 inoculation sites across the Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits had to be shut, while the areas in rural Pune too reported early wrap up of the drive. With a meagre 2,260 Covishield doses available for over 200 sites in Pune rural, some of the inoculation sites wrapped their daily vaccination by afternoon, while others resorted to Covaxin to continue the vaccination drive. The vaccine shortage was evident with the fact that around 299 vaccination sites remained closed due to the unavailability across the district, half of which were from Pune rural alone, while only 203 sites were functional. The drive, in the Pune civic limits, was no different with many centres turning down the beneficiaries due to the unavailability of the vaccine. According to the district health office report, despite no vaccination drive in the PCMC limits on Friday, the district recorded vaccination of 23,776 people, around 90% of whom were senior citizens (above 60 years) and those above 45 years (with/without comorbidities). Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer (CEO) of the Pune zilla parishad, told TOI, “We had 2,260 Covishield doses available on Friday morning and around 19,000 Covaxin doses. So, we decided to go ahead with Covaxin at some of the centres, while we exhausted all the Covishield doses that were available with us.” Rajesh Patil, commissioner, PCMC, said with the availability of the fresh doses, they would resume the inoculation across the private and civic facilities on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/drive-to-resume-today-as-district-gets-1l-dose-boost/articleshow/81995324.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The results were received on Friday. A senior doctor said that if the three strains have penetrated the state and are responsible for the spurt in cases over the past few days, “we are in a very difficult position”. “If these strains are responsible for the exponential rise in cases in the state, we don’t know what we are fighting against,” he said. “It is double trouble, because all of us who have taken the vaccine have become complacent, and do not follow Covid-appropriate behavior.” He said that Covishield may not offer protection against the new strains. “There is sufficient grounds for us not to be complacent even if we have been vaccinated,” he said, adding that several doctors from a hospital in Maharashtra contracted Covid-19 even after they had taken both doses of the vaccine. “I would advise people to be careful, and not let down your guard until it is absolutely clear what kind of strains are in circulation,” he said. Since Goa has to rely on NIV, Pune, for testing of new strains with long waits till results are received, the government has already decided to set up the facility within the state. However, this will take time, an official said. Meanwhile, the vaccination drive picked up some steam with 6,271 doses being administered on Friday, the highest in a single day since the drive started mid-January.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/four-covid-strains-circulating-in-goa-niv-report/articleshow/81996196.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Mumbai||Don’t use loudspeakers for ‘sehri’ call: Islamic Centre||MUMBAI: Head of Islamic Centre of India and senior cleric Maulana Khalid Rasheed Firangimahli has urged mosques not to use loudspeakers to awaken community members for sehri, the pre-dawn light meal during Ramzan. Ramzan is starting next week and many mosques may announce the beginning and end of sehri on loudspeakers, creating noise in the morning hours for a month. This plea is part of a 15-point advisory the Islamic Centre of India has released. “These days everybody carries a mobile which also has an alarm clock. They should set the sehri time in the alarm and avoid using loudspeakers, which disturb people in the early hours. An announcement on the speakers is not mandated by the religion,” said Maulana Firangimahli. Anti-noise activist and founder of Awaaz Foundation Sumaira Abdulali welcomed the move. “I welcome this advisory and congratulate the Maulana Sahab for initiating this much-needed step. However, I would like all religions to stop using loudspeakers in places of worship. Use of loudspeakers for azaan is an old custom. The world has moved ahead. They should use radio frequency to inform people about namaz and sehri times,” said Abdulali. Executive council member of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) M Asif Farooqui too welcomed the advisory against using loudspeakers for sehri announcement. “These days announcements on loudspeakers for sehri are not needed. Everyone who fasts knows the time of iftar and sehri and can set it on their alarm clocks. We should try to reduce noise pollution, not add to it,” said Farooqui. Frinagimahli’s 15-point ‘Ramzan Advisory’ also calls upon the community members to abide by lockdown protocols. Places where mosques are not shut, Muslims must follow the guidelines while holding congregational prayers, he reminded. “Don’t call more than 100 people for a namaz,” he said. For the tarawih namaz, a special prayer in the night in Ramzan when a hafiz (one who has memorized the Quran) recites verses from the Quran and others stand behind him to listen to the recitations, Firangimahli said it should be kept shorter so that people can return home before the night curfew starts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dont-use-loudspeakers-for-sehri-call-islamic-centre/articleshow/81996994.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

A senior corporation official said that the public health departments of the civic bodies are analysing cremation data to rationalise resources such as PPE kits, disinfection equipment and workers so avoid any mismanagement. A bulletin released by the health ministry on Thursday stated that 11,157deaths in the city have occurred due to Covid. Nigambodh Ghat, the biggest cremation ground of the city, had also carried out the first Covid-protocol funeral of a 68-year-old woman from Janakpuri on March 14, 2020, which created controversies due to delays and confusion. The second largest facility that saw such funerals was Punjabi Bagh shamshan bhumi, while Kotla burial ground near ITO carried out maximum burials for Covid patients who died, an official said. The mayor of North Delhi Municipal Corporation, Jai Prakash, said that six sites have been dedicated for Covid funerals, in which 5,504 funerals took place between March 14, 2020 and April 5, 2021. Prakash said that 3,097 such funerals were at Nigambodh Ghat, 623 in Beri Wala Bagh, 551 in Panchkuian road, 52 in Inderpuri cremation ground and 192 in Mangolpuri cremation ground. At the Mangolpuri facility, 127 bodies of Christian patients and 113 of Muslim patients were buried as well in their respective areas. Officials say that 624 suspected cases out of 5,504 funerals were also dealt with Covid-related guidelines issued by the ministry of health and family welfare. Leader of the House in South Delhi Municipal Corporation said a total of 5,397 Covid protocol funerals took place in its facilities in 2020, while 267 cases have been processed in 2021 till April 7. Chawla said that SDMC has the capacity to handle 260 bodies with Covid-protocol every day. EDMC has earmarked 35 funeral pyre platforms for Covid funerals this year in places including Karkardooma, Ghazipur, Seemapuri and Buland masjid. EDMC offiicals informed that a total of 1,992 covid protocol funerals have taken place in 5 facilities under EDMC so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpns-study-last-years-data-on-covid-funerals-to-avoid-any-chaos/articleshow/81997520.cms||Paras Singh

---||Pune||Pune: Indigenous mRNA vax candidate’s clinical trials soon||PUNE: The clinical trials of India’s first indigenous mRNA vaccine candidate — HGCO19 — to assess its safety and immunogenicity against Covid-19 could begin in a few weeks in Pune and Kolhapur. Principal scientific adviser to the Centre K VijayRaghavan, also co-chair of the Vaccine Task Force, told TOI, “The mRNA vaccines are a new approach to vaccination. The usual route involves growing large amounts of vaccines using live cells as vehicles. This is cumbersome and slow. Messenger RNA, which encodes the viral protein, can be made in large amounts without using live cells.” The technology is like the one used for the Pfizer vaccine, said Ashish Bavdekar, one of the investigators heading the trials in Pune’s KEM Hospital Research Centre. Kolhapur’s Rajashree Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Govt Medical College would be the second site for trials. VijayRaghavan said India needed many types of vaccines. “mRNA vaccines can be manufactured rapidly and new vaccines against variant viral proteins can be more readily made. A wide portfolio of vaccine platforms is good. This effort needs appreciation as it brings a new platform to India and will be of value for other applications going ahead,” he said. The vaccine has been developed by Pune-based Gennova Biopharmaceuticals Limited in collaboration with HDT Biotech Corporation, Seattle, USA. Dr Bavdekar told TOI, “DCGI on December 12 had given a conditional approval for Phase I/ II human clinical trials. We are awaiting the final clearance. This being an mRNA vaccine, it has to undergo several clearances. This vaccine will not require stringent storage conditions and can be stored at the standard 2-8°C temperature.” Bavdekar said since the vaccine would undergo human trials for the first time, the phase-1 study would enrol a limited number of volunteers -- 120 healthy participants in the age group of 18-70 years. Dr Pradeep DCosta, one of the investigators of the trials at KEM, said, “If the vaccine comes through, the country will have one more vaccine to choose from, addressing possible shortages.” VijayRaghavan added, “Top quality science is needed to make sure that the mRNA is packed to be delivered reliably into our cells, that it does not degrade rapidly, and makes sufficient viral protein to stimulate our immune response.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/indigenous-mrna-vax-candidates-clinical-trials-soon/articleshow/81995347.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||Pune: Curbs bring down shutters of many restaurants||PUNE: The drastic drop in the number of excise licence renewals and applications for new permits tells the story of the hard time the hospitality sector is going through due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Renewals have dropped to 493 from 1,800 per year in the pre-Covid-19 times in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad (See graphic). “After retirement in October 2019, I invested in an eatery franchise last year and opened a shop in Katraj. But due to the lockdown, we were completely shut from March till October,” said a retired transport management officer, who lost a chunk of his life savings in the venture. “Business has not picked up since. I had to let my staffers go and decided to shut the business fearing another shutdown,” he said. Ganesh Shetty, president of the Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association (PRAHA), said 70 member restaurants only from Kothrud area have not renewed their licences and have shut down. “PRAHA has 850 restaurants, mostly ‘family restaurants’, veg and non-veg and grade one ventures. Of them, 10% failed to renew their licence in 2020. The restaurants were shut for the major part of last year. Though we were allowed to restart business after relaxations in the lockdown in October 2021, many started operations in November and December as they waited for their staffers to return hometowns,” Shetty said. “Following the recent curbs, another 24% restarurants decided it would be futile to renew their licences this year if the situation would be the same as 2020,” he said. About 200 fine-dine and family restaurants have not renewd their licences and have shut down due to shortfall of finances. Santosh Zagade, superintendent, state excise office, Pune, said, “During the pre-Covid times, we usually got 1,800 applications for excise licence renewals every year. But this year, there have been only 493. For 2019-2020, there were about 250 applications for new (restaurant/bar) licences. This coincided with the average number of the previous years. But for 2020-2021, we received only 150 new applications.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/curbs-bring-down-shutters-of-many-restos/articleshow/81995360.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||YS Sharmila’s new party on July 8, to undertake 3-day fast in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: Superstar Rajinikanth’s popular dialogue ‘Simham single ga vastundi’ (Lion always comes alone) from the film ‘Sivaji’ came in handy for YS Sharmila to announce her arrival in Telangana politics. She declared that she would be launching her new party on July 8 this year. July 8 is her late father, former CM YS Rajasekhara Reddy’s birth anniversary. “My party will not work under any party. I am an arrow that has been released by the people themselves,” thundered Sharmila at a public meeting ‘Sankalpa Sabha’ in Khammam on Friday evening. She also announced that she would undertake a three-day fast from April 15 in Hyderabad to pressurise chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to announce job notifications for youth. “There are 1.91 lakh vacancies. The government has to fill them. After my three-day fast, my party cadre will undertake relay fasts in the districts,” she said. She urged the youth not to take their lives as she would lead the fight to pressurise the government to issue job notifications. Sharmila said the flag of the new party, name and its ideology would be unveiled and explained on July 8. At the Sankalpa Sabha organised to coincide with the day YSR undertook a padayatra from Chevella to Ichchapuram 18 years ago on April 9, 2003, Sharmila said she would be like her father who kept his words and promises. Sharmila, who is the younger sister of AP CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, did not take his name even once during the nearly 50-minute speech. “I am committed to Telangana. I will oppose any project that goes against the interests of Telangana. I will not allow a single drop of water to be denied to Telangana as its right,” she said at the meeting, in which her mother YS Vijayamma also participated. Sharmila went in a car rally from her Lotus Pond residence in Hyderabad to Khammam. There were huge cutouts of hers and YSR at the meeting venue. “There is no comparison between YSR and KCR. My father kept his word. I was happy when Telangana was achieved, but the self-respect of the people and the state is under his feet now. There is a need to question KCR and my party will do it,” she asserted. Sharmila’s constant refrain all through her speech was that she would question KCR. “All the opposition parties have got sold out to him. My party will not be like that,” she claimed. Recalling that it was YSR who conceived the Pranahitha Chevella project, she said KCR had redesigned it and increased its cost. “Isn’t corruption involved there,” she questioned. Sharmila laced her speech with several proverbs which are common in Telangana, striking a chord with the public. “Bara bar vostham,” she said, driving home the point that she has a right to play a big role in Telangana politics. “Whether anyone agrees or not, I am a daughter of Telangana. I have a bond with the place. I have studied here, lived my life here, raised a family here,” she said. “My connection with Telangana is inseparable,” she added. Targeting KCR again, she referred to him as a ‘dora’ (landlord). She said Congress ‘supplies’ MLAs to the TRS and the BJP talks only about communal politics. “Don’t be scared of the ruling party. I am here to fight for you. If people bless me, I will serve them or else I will fight for them,” she said. “I believed KCR when he led the movement for a separate Telangana state but now he is a different person. He is not accessible and has not entered the secretariat. It is a shame that 6,000 farmers have died by suicide in Telangana, which is the second highest number in the country,” she said. Though KCR promised 12% reservations for minorities it did not happen, she pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sharmilas-new-party-on-july-8-to-undertake-3-day-fast/articleshow/81995369.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Goa||Govt to open, e-auction new mining leases in state||Panaji: The state government, through the Goa Mining Corporation, has decided to open new iron ore mines in the state other than the 88 leases pending before the Supreme Court. Speaking to TOI, chief minister Pramod Sawant said that the government would sign an MoU with the Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd (MECL), which would help the state start the process for e-auction. There are 254 valid mining leases in Goa, spread over Pernem, Sattari, Ponda, Sanguem, Bardez, Bicholim, Tiswadi and Quepem talukas. Sawant said that valid mining leases would be e-auctioned in the state. “We will not touch the 88 mining leases of which the matter is pending before the Supreme Court,” he said He also said that MECL will identify the minerals available in those virgin mining leases before the e-auction. The Goa Mining Corporation “will be functional before May 30”, Sawant said on Thursday. The deadline was fixed at a meeting held with secretaries to discuss the implementation of the budget. Mining in Goa came to a halt in March 2018, following the decision of the Supreme Court to quash the second renewal of 88 mining leases. During the Portuguese period, Goa had 806 mining concessions, and in 1987, after the concessions were abolished and converted into leases, the number had reduced to 595 leases. In 1987-88 and in 2000, 438 lease holders had applied for first renewal. Subsequently, 413 lease holders had applied in 2006 for a second renewal. Out of the 595 valid mining leases in Goa, the state government cancelled 252 leases of those holders who had not applied during the first or second renewal of mining leases in 1987 and 2007. On October 2013, 119 mining leases were cancelled and another 133 were cancelled in November 2013. Before mining came to halt in September 2012, around 110 mining leases were in operation and around 45 million tonnes of iron ore were exported from Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-to-open-e-auction-new-mining-leases-in-state/articleshow/81996182.cms||Murari Shetye

---||Kolkata||West Bengal assembly elections: Contestants peddle ‘change’ as poor infra continues to ail Howrah||HOWRAH: Howrah, which remained Kolkata’s poor cousin for years, was finally given its due when chief minister Mamata Banerjee shifted the state secretariat to Shibpur in 2013. Nabanna’s arrival at Howrah’s doorstep did bring about some development, but basic amenities, such as the quality of drinking water, road, transport, healthcare and education, still demand a lot of improvement. Candidates in Howrah Sadar parliamentary constituency, which comprise assembly segments of Howrah Central, Shibpur, Howrah South, Howrah North, Bally, Sankrail and Panchla, have been peddling hopes for better infrastructure and amenities. With Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC), which has been facing budgetary constraints for two-and-a-half years, when civic elections have not been held, everything is managed by a board of administrators. Barring some portions of Shibpur, which are in focus for being included in the Nabanna Development Zone, the rest of Howrah—chaotic and unclean. Once an industry hub, the city is seeing a migration of students and professionals. “We study in Kolkata and it’s a sea change the moment you cross the bridge. We don’t aspire to live here. Howrah will not change unless there is a huge shake-up,” said Anindya Basu, a student at Subir Bose Degree Engineering College and resident of Chunabhati in Howrah South. Sourav Sengupta, an IIEST pass-out who lives in a complex on Andul Road, said, “For over a decade, the candidates have been promising a connector between the congested Andul Road and Kona Expressway but nothing has happened.” Trinamool’s Nandita Chowdhury, a first-time candidate and late politician Ambika Banerjee’s daughter, said, “I grew up here and I am aware of the problems. I will be walking with the people.” Her rival, BJP’s Rantideb Sengupta, who had lost in the 2019 LS contest, is selling development. Howrah Central and Shibpur constituencies, which overlap with each other, share their problems. These being the oldest parts of the city, most area are unplanned, open drains line the roads, garbage pile up on the side and water supply is poor. “We were about to solve the water crisis, but Port Trust stalled the project, saying it would cause problems for vessels,” said Arup Roy, Trinamool minister and two-time MLA. He has been showcasing the revival of schools, which had almost closed, expansion of Howrah Girls’ College and the sports city around Howrah Indoor Stadium at Dumurjala. “The brightly lit Drainage Canal Road and the beautified greens around the Dumurjala helipad are not Howrah’s realities,” said BJP candidate Sanjay Singh, pointing to the slums of Belilious Road, Tikiapara and Foreshore Road. “These are Covid hotbeds. People—most of them civic conservancy workers—and pigs live in the same rooms,” he said.  Most factories at Bajrangbali near Ghushuri in the North Howrah constituency, once tagged as Asia’s biggest scrap iron and pipes market, have shut and at least 50% of the migrant population returned to their villages. Real estate boom led to haphazard growth, increasing the pressure on the infrastructure. “The HMC has been defunct though we have tried our best from outside,” said Trinamool candidate Gautam Chowdhury, who was the MMiC, conservancy. Sitting MLA Lakshmiratan Shukla resigned from Trinamool. BJP contestant, Umesh Rai, a local and an RSS fulltimer, has been promising the voters with change-induced development. This was the only segment in the 2019 LS polls, where BJP led in Howrah. In 2013, Rai’s wife defeated then Howra mayor. In Bally, young turk from the Left squad, JNU research scholar, Dipshita Dhar, has generated a lot of interest among voters, perhaps because she speaks a language which is different in rhetoric and tone from that of seasoned politicians. She talks about aspirations of the educated youth, dangers of the Bengali-non-Bengali divide and the consequent collapse of infrastructure and the de-linking of the Bally Municipality with HMC. Her rivals are Vaishali Dalmiya, who won the seat on a Trinamool ticket in 2016 but now joined the BJP, and Trinamool candidate paediatrician Rana Chatterjee. Both Dipshita and Chatterjee are projected as locals who empathize with residents’ cause. Howrah is awaiting the next spectacle, East-West Metro.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/contestants-peddle-change-as-poor-infra-continues-to-ail-howrah/articleshow/81995377.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Elgar hearing: Court asks how defence got digital forensic report||Mumbai: The special NIA court in the Elgar Parishad case on Thursday directed the defence to clarify how it got custody of the Arsenal Consulting’s report, which has been ‘purportedly’ addressed to the court. The US-based forensic lab’s report had indicated planting of evidence on the laptop of an accused. The report was earlier cited by accused Rona Wilson in the Bombay high court and now before the NIA court during academician Anand Teltumbde’s bail plea. Both Wilson and Teltumbde are in custody. “Upon perusal of the document..it appears that it is the copy of the report addressed to the court in the present proceedings. On inquiry with the sheristedar (court staff), it is reported that the court has not received such a report. Record reveals that at no point of time... Arsenal Consulting was called upon by this court to submit the report,” the court said, adding that the defence was to clarify how they procured the document. The prosecution, too, raised questions on the authenticity and source of the documents. It said that the report could not be cited in the bail proceedings. Wilson, in his plea before the HC, had cited the report which said his computer had been ‘compromised’ for 22 months. It had said Wilson’s was “one of the most serious cases involving evidence tampering” that the firm had encountered “based on various metrics that include the vast time span between the delivery of the first and last incriminating documents”. The NIA’s case is that on December 31, 2017, Elgar Parishad at Shaniwarwada in Pune, was funded by the banned CPI (M) as part of a conspiracy to create unrest and provocative speeches promoted enmity between various caste groups. This, they said, led to the January 1, 2018, clashes at Koregaon Bhima. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-elgar-hearing-court-asks-how-defence-got-digital-forensic-report/articleshow/81996996.cms||---

Zydus Hospital had become a lifeline of sorts for kin of Covid-19 patients in need of the injection.Despite assurance from the state administration, shortage of remdesivir injections was rampant across Gujarat over the past week. Earlier this week, on April 4, the group had announced the availability of remdesivir injection at Rs 899 on the hospital premises from April 5-12. Amdavadis, who were struggling due to shortage of the injection, turned to Zydus Hospital with high hopes of getting remdesivir; while many managed to get their hands on it, some left empty-handed.And even as the state made some 24,687 remdesivir injection ampoules available on Friday, obtaining favipiravir is also becoming a concern as the medicine is rapidly flying off shelves. According to data provided by FDCA Gujarat, the consumption of favipiravir has gone up by a significant 80% in the first 10 days of April.Against 17.4 lakh tablets of favipiravir prescribed to people in Gujarat in March, 31.3 lakh tablets were consumed in first nine days of April alone, suggests data by FDCA. “The demand went up significantly in March and in the first week of April, it has gone higher up. With barely any demand in February, manufacturers had slowed down manufacturing of the medicines however,the multi-fold increase in demand in March did disrupt the supply chain. Over the past two-three days, we’re compelled to turn down customers as the stock which arrives is depleted soon,” said Ankur Aggarwal, founder, Medkart.Upon randomly checking with seven medical stores in Ahmedabad, most had run out of stock for favipiravir. “We’ve been getting barely 10 strips of favipiravir for each dosage daily because the stockist from whom we procure isn’t getting enough stock,” said a chemist in Navrangpura.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/zydus-hospital-halts-remdesivir-sale-at-its-counter/articleshow/81995387.cms||Niyati Parikh

The DoE has said that instructions to conduct the exams online will only be applicable for subjects and schools where the tests have not been held already. “It is now informed that the examination of Class IX and XI should be conducted by allowing students to answer from their residence, in the same manner as for up to Class VIII. This circular is applicable for the examinations which are yet pending,” director Dilip Bhagat said in a circular. This would mean sending the students the question paper over either Whatsapp, email or the school app. The students will then write the answers and upload a photograph or scanned copy of the answer sheet online at the time the exam ends. The school then keeps a drop box at the institute, where parents submit the actual answer sheets. The teachers then compare the soft copy of the answer sheet with the actual one to ascertain that there has been no cheating by the student. As exams of the state board are set to begin later this month, schools had been instructed by DoE to complete all examinations conducted by the institution before April 24. In most schools, the Class IX exams began this week and the Class XI exams were set to begin from Monday. The exams were planned in the physical mode, as per earlier instructions of the DoE.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-covid-cases-rise-class-ix-xi-exams-move-online/articleshow/81996208.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

South Goa SP Pankaj Kumar Singh said they were tipped-off that two men would be coming on two-wheelers to “deliver” three girls to their prospective customers at a certain place at Comba, Margao.  Police personnel then laid a trap and the two persons were apprehended red-handed. Three women aged 34, 35 and 23 were rescued, Singh said. The accused have been identified as Arman Khan, 29, a resident of housing board, Davorlim, Salcete, and Tejas Marathe, 19, a resident of Madel, Margao.

---||Goa||End stir or lose permit: Govt to taxi operators||PANAJI: Following threats by taxi operators, transport minister Mauvin Godinho on Friday warned that if they resort to violence, the state government would cancel their permits and will not issue fresh permits for the next five years. Godinho said that the taxi operators have started the agitation to scrap GoaMiles mainly to divert attention, “as they do not want to install digital meters which will monitor them”. Stating that the taxi operators should sit across the table with the government to negotiate on their demands, Godinho, however, said that “if taxi operators put forth preconditions for holding a meeting, then the government will not sit for talks”. He also warned that permits of taxi operators on whose cabs digital meters are not installed would be cancelled. “As per the high court order, and as mandated by the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH), taxi operators have to fix meters to their vehicles,” he said. Speaking to reporters, Godinho said that taxi operators have no reason to resort to an agitation. “Ours is a responsible government. We will be tackling it with an iron hand and will not give in to the taxi operators’ demand to scrap GoaMiles,” he said. He also said that in the eventuality of a strike by taxi operators, KTC is ready to transport tourists to the coastal belt. “Taxi operators will be spoiling their own case by allowing GoaMiles to help tourists during a strike,” Godinho said. “Taxi operators want to charge tourists the maximum and finish tourism,” he added. The transport minister, however, pulled up GoaMiles, who he said is flouting rules by soliciting customers at the Dabolim airport. “This is not the way how a cab aggregator should operate. An app-based taxi service should not operate through counters, but should operate through phone, and I am very much clear on that,” he said. Godinho stated “that there is no need for one more taxi aggregator as it will create confusion” and suggested that the taxi operators should instead start their own app-based service, “which the government will support”. While pointing out that the Essential Service Maintenance Act (ESMA) is in force till May, Godinho said “the state government will not hesitate to take action against taxi operators as taxis come under essential services”. “We want to solve the problem, and 1,000 people cannot hold the tourism business and economy to ransom,” he added. “Taxi operators first said they want to install taxi meters, but now they have no intention of doing that. That they will install taxi meters only after GoaMiles is scrapped is just an excuse. Earlier, it was easier to tamper with digital meters and put them out of order, but now we are insisting on back-end service through NIC, which will have GPS, a panic button and automatic monitoring. The taxi operators don’t want to be monitored,” Godinho said, while adding that the government has decided to install meters free of charge, at a cost of Rs 34 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/end-stir-or-lose-permit-govt-to-taxi-operators/articleshow/81996217.cms||Murari Shetye

For the crowd that gathered at the Khammam Pavilion Grounds on Friday, the message was loud and clear. YS Sharmila had her mother Vijayamma’s unstinted support in the political path that she chose to pursue in Telangana. “Please bless my daughter,” Vijayamma said, explaining how Sharmila had told her on February 9 this year that she shares a bond with Telangana and it is here that she desired to serve the people. “I was happy when she told me this. My son has not been able to do it, but my daughter has got a strong interest to serve the people of Telangana,” she said. “She is the daughter-in-law of Telangana and she is unwavering in her love for the people who welcomed her when she undertook a padayatra after YSR’s death,” she added. Recalling all the programmes that her late husband YSR had introduced as CM, she said he did it with the hope that someone would carry them forward even if he were not to be alive. She said YSR was a ‘dhammunna nayakudu’ (courageous leader) unlike others. “My daughter has the courage just like her father. Bless her,” she told the public. She said every party had respect for YSR. “As an MLA when I met former PM Manmohan Singh, he told me that the government at the Centre was firmly in place only because of YSR. Similarly, PM Narendra Modi had once told me that it was only when YSR died that the BJP party’s flag was flown half-mast. It was not done for the leader of any other party,” she said. At the meeting, Sharmila’s close aide Konda Raghava Reddy alleged that police were stopping people from reaching the venue despite police giving permission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vijayamma-my-daughter-has-ysrs-courage-bless-her/articleshow/81995379.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Antigen or RT-PCR test allowed for work permits||Mumbai: Maharashtra on Friday relaxed the rule that mandated non-vaccinated people working across sectors to undergo a RT-PCR test. It has now allowed the less accurate, but swifter rapid antigen test as an alternative, presumably since the RT-PCR decision led to an overburdening on laboratories and crowding at swab collection centres. It had also led to people with Covid symptoms struggling to get appointments for RT-PCR. In a fresh guideline by principal secretary Aseem Gupta on Friday, rapid antigen test was allowed as an option to RT-PCR. The test requirement was brought in as part of the ‘Break the Chain’ guidelines announced by the state on April 4, which stated that from April 10 people in sectors including transport, entertainment, home delivery, wedding venues, manufacturing, vendors, and staff conducting examinations have to carry a RT-PCR negative report with a validity for 15 days. Since the rule comes into effect from April 10, the demand for RT-PCR had soared in the past few days. It also resulted in the turnaround time for labs stretching to 4-5 days. On Friday, there were serpentine queues outside the RT-PCR swab collection centre at Nesco ground, Goregaon. Krishna Kumar, who travelled from Nalasopara to Goregaon for the second day to get tested, said: “On the first day, the counter shut before my turn. So, today I stood in line since 6am, but there were people waiting before me.” Employed in a manufacturing unit, Kumar said he has already lost wages for both days. Shyamnarayan Chaudhari, a carpenter, said the decision should have been taken after increasing the number of labs and collection centres. Maharashtra has 523 labs, including 227 antigen collection centres. The decision has even affected work in industries in Vasai-Virar and Palghar. Factory owners said employees below 45 years are queuing up for testing, which is keeping them aw-ay from work. “The tests have to be done every fortnight. Without negative reports they cannot even enter the factory premises,” said Ajay Modi, president, Vasai Industrial Manufacturers Welfare Association. In the Boisar-MIDC industrial belt, several factories in drug manufacturing have not been able to meet their daily production targets as workers are lining up for the test. The district administration has ordered that those awaiting report should not step out till the report comes negative. If an employee is found positive, the factory will have to be shut for disinfection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-antigen-or-rt-pcr-test-allowed-for-work-permits/articleshow/81996228.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Delhi||No offline work in Delhi schools||NEW DELHI: Due to the surge in Covid-19 cases, Delhi government has suspended all activities in schools. While practicals of Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) are being conducted in all schools, government and aided schools have also been holding the annual and pre-board examinations. Announcing the decision, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted: “In view of the rising Covid-19 cases, all classes in schools (government, private) in Delhi will remain closed till further orders.” The government had earlier allowed schools to reopen for students of classes IX to XII for conducting practicals, clearing doubts and holding examinations. While private schools had stated the new academic session, government schools were still conducting exams. A circular issued by the government stated, “All heads of government, government-aided and unaided recognised schools are hereby informed that conduct of all academic and examination activities through physical mode shall remain suspended with immediate effect till further orders. They are further directed to ensure that no student of classes IX to XII is called in the school for any kind of academic or examination activity, like practice of practicals, mid-term and annual examination-related work (practicals, project submission and assessments).” Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School, said, “CBSE has given a window till June 11 for completion of the practicals. Many schools are almost halfway through, so once the cases reduce they can restart again.” A government school principal said that just 3-4 annual examinations for classes IX and XI and pre-boards for classes X and XII were remaining. “Exams have been completed for Class XI science stream students. The CBSE practicals were going on, but now I’m concerned whether board exams can begin from May 4,” said AK Jha, principal of Government Co-ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Sector 8, Rohini. Students have been asking for online board exams due to the rise in Covid-19 cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-offline-work-in-delhi-schools/articleshow/81997527.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Queue sera sera: Anxious lines of people are criss-crossing the state||Ahmedabad/Surat/Vadodara/Rajkot: Khalil Dhantejvi, the 82-year-old poet who penned ‘Ab main ration ki kataron mein nazar aata hoon’, died earlier this week due to old-age complications in Vadodara. In corona pandemic, his lyrics resonated with every common man as fighting the dreaded Covid-19, a person finds himself in a queue practically for everything — testing, getting reports, getting an ICU bed, buying remdesevir, refilling oxygen bottles and last but not the least, at the crematoriums too where dead and their relatives wait for their turn for hours on end.Only on Friday, at least 19 bodies were cremated at the special Covid-19 crematorium near Golden bridge in Bharuch. At least 5-6 pyres could be seen lit neatly in a row. In Surat and Vadodara, videos of bodies queued up, waiting for their turn for the final rites to be performed, have gone viral. In Surat, such is the rush at crematoriums that bodies are now being sent to Bardoli, 40 km from the city. Ever since the pandemic struck in March 2020, Gujarat learnt to queue up. First during lockdown to buy essentials, board a bus or train back home. As the infectious capability of the virus increases, the latest surge is witnessing queues of unprecedented order. In Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Surat, hundreds queue up with prescriptions to buy remdesevir injections. The situation in Rajkot, Surat and Vadodara is currently grim with people having to excruciatingly wait in blistering heat for testing, hospital admission, remdesivir and even conducting the last rites of their deceased kin.People have to stand in long queues for nearly 4-5 hours only for RT-PCR tests in government hospitals. In Vadodara, some private laboratories have begun a token system. In Ahmedabad, people queue up early in the morning till late night outside labs for their turn to get tested.For home-visits, there is a waiting of 36 hours. Also, test reports are taking nearly 48 hours as compared to 9-10 hours earlier. For patients or their relatives who are looking to get admissions in some select hospitals, they have to join a waiting list. In Ahmedabad, major hospitals reported a waiting of 30 patients for a bed! Call after call to hospitals is met with an eerily similar answer — all beds are full. “If you wish, please register your name in the wait list,” Amidst death and disease all around, one question in the minds of desperate people battling pandemic — is there a way to jump the queue please.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/queue-sera-sera-anxious-lines-of-people-are-criss-crossing-the-state/articleshow/81995398.cms||---
---||Delhi||Curbs on, crowd starts thinning at Delhi markets||NEW DELHI: The markets are feeling the impact of the rise in Covid-19 cases in the city, the restrictions on movement at night and strict vigilance by the administration. On Friday, there were visibly fewer shoppers in the usually crammed markets. The traders felt that because of the sharp rise in infection numbers, worried people were hurrying to finish their shopping and reach home before the 10pm deadline. TOI visited Lajpat Nagar and Sarojini Nagar markets on Friday evening to assess the crowd behaviour. In Central Market at Lajpat Nagar, the majority of people appeared to be wearing masks. The big showrooms were mostly empty, and the people were buying wares from the small shops. There were teams of Delhi Police and civil defence volunteers keeping tabs on and punishing any Covid-rule violations. “The administration is doing its job efficiently, but we have to be equally vigilant now. So, we have asked all shopowners here to allow only 2-3 customers into the shops at a time inside,” said Ashwini Marwah, secretary, Traders’ Association of Lajpat Nagar. “There’s thermal scanning too and insistence on masks. However, keeping physical distancing in the small Pushpa Market is difficult.” Traders said that in the summers, people started coming around 2pm and shopped till late. “But now by 8pm, the crowd starts thinning, with especially those coming from NCR areas wrapping up early,” revealed a shopkeeper. In Sarojini Nagar, there was a contrast in the lanes crowded by hawkers and disregard for masks and distancing. Things were better in the main market. “The hawkers always draw the crowds because the young buyers and local residents prefer their affordable items. But you won’t see chaos at the main or mini market,” said Ashok Randhawa, president, Mini Market Traders’ Association. Also, unlike at Lajpat Nagar, police and civic defence personnel were not prominent at the entrance or inside the market. “Both the cops and the civil volunteers usually disappear in the afternoon and come later in the evening to keep an eye on violations,” claimed Randhawa. “There is scope for improving the vigilance and perhaps there should be stricter action against violators. At the same time, the Covid testing centres near the Delhi Metro station and the police booth are working efficiently.” Traders said shoppers normally came to the market at this time for wedding purchases. “They also come to buy bedsheets, dress material, shoes and decorative items in bulk at reasonable rates,” said Ashok Kalra, member of the Sarojini Nagar Market Association. “But these days, you see people buying in limited quantities or relying on online shopping for their needs. In fact, many shops get hardly 4-5 customers in a day.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/curbs-on-crowd-starts-thinning-at-markets/articleshow/81997574.cms||Vibha Sharma

Goswami, Firoze Sheikh and Nitish Sarda have been accused of abetting the suicide of interior designer Anvay Naik in May 2018 over alleged non-payment of dues by their companies. The trio has moved the HC seeking to quash the FIR and chargesheet filed by the police . The HC had on March 5 granted the accused exemption from appearance before the court and said it would hear the petitions on April 16. Goswami’s counsel Sanjog Parab on Friday said since April 16 has been declared as a holiday by the HC, the petitions could be heard later and the interim order granting Goswami exemption may be extended as the next date before the magistrate is April 26. A division bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale agreed and said it would hear the petitions on April 23.

---||Chandigarh||Most micro containment zones exist without any safety measures in Ludh||Ludhiana: The district administration may have set up many micro-containment zones to check cases, but norms are not being followed to contain infection in majority of such zones and many of them are not even barricaded. According to the state media bulletin of Thursday, there were eight micro-containment zones in Ludhiana district — BRS Nagar, Model Gram, Rishi Nagar, Phase Two Dugri, Urban Estate Phase One Dugri, New Madhopuri areas of city and in Dhanansu and a village at Payal block. TOI checked how things were being monitored in many micro-containment zones and found that guidelines in most such zones were violated. At micro-containment zone in Model Gram area, where a two-member central team had visited on Thursday, there was a only rope at one of the entry/exit points where there was no such rope at the other end. Here there was no police presence and people were coming out and going inside the zone without being checked. Also, the rope that was tied at the entry/exit point of the street was around seven feet high so vehicles were crossing from there. At two micro-containment zones in Dugri area, TOI didn’t find any barricading and people were found roaming around in the streets. Many were spotted without masks as well. Here no cops could be seen. Local sources at New Madhopuri area, where one such zone has been made, said few days ago a rope was tied at the entry/exit point of the street but that has disappeared. They added that they didn’t find any cops stationed at the micro-containment zone. A resident of BRS Nagar where one such zone has come up said there is no barricading there and people move in the area freely. He added that no cops have been posted at such zone to control people coming out or going inside the zone. Civil surgeon Dr Sukhjeevan Kakkar didn’t respond to repeated calls, but a health department officer said district administration and police has to ensure a system so that people don’t come out or go inside such zones except in case of emergencies. He added that they will have to check why guidelines for many of such micro-containment zones are not being followed in these areas. Principal secretary, department of health and family welfare, Hussan Lal said the main purpose of containment zones is to close the area and in such areas normally physical road blocks are installed so that no one enters or goes out except in cases of emergencies, where one can call an ambulance and that can come. He added that in such zones special supplies are ensured by the district administration. Principal secretary further said round the clock police presence is a must otherwise there will be no containment. He added that regulations are same for micro containment zones. Commissioner of police (CP) Rakesh Aggarwal did not respond to repeated calls, a senior officer of Ludhiana police said that it was the administration which has to set up such barricades. However, he added that police presence will be beefed up in such zones. Deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma said he has told CP, SSPs to take immediate action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/most-micro-containment-zones-exist-without-any-safety-measures-in-ludh/articleshow/81993819.cms||Shariq Majeed

The decision was taken by the Gujarat Paan Masala Shop Owners’ Association, late on Friday, due to the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in the city. The city reported 1,296 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Friday. “To ensure that people don’t crowd near shops and establishments, we’ve decided to keep our shops shut over the weekends throughout April,” said Sanjay Joshi, president, Gujarat Paan Masala Shop Owners’ Association. Following the announcement, many shops ran out of cigarettes as citizens began buying in bulk. Crowds were seen at some paan shops in Navrangpura, Prahladnagar, Vejalpur and Satellite areas of the city. Last year, ahead of the lockdown, the state government had ordered the shutting of paan shops and imposed restrictions on the number of people at shops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/paan-shops-to-stay-shut-over-weekends/articleshow/81995404.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||This candidate from Telangana cries & falls at voters’ feet||HYDERABAD: Imagine running into a candidate contesting in a bypoll crying out loud and seeking votes? That is exactly what is first-time contestant and BJP nominee Panugothu Ravi Kumar Naik has been doing while seeking votes from the people in Nagarjuna Sagar assembly constituency. A candidate crying openly is not something voters would hardly expect but for Naik, who is a doctor, weeping comes naturally. His rivals were quick to cash in on this by depicting him as a weak candidate, but Naik has an answer for this. “I wept in my village. I touched the feet of my people. I cried and requested them to bless me. I did it and I am not ashamed of it,” the 36-year-old says. The elections are due on April 17. After filing his nomination papers, Naik went to his native village of Palugu thanda in Tripuraram mandal along with his supporters earlier this month. It was here that he burst out aloud giving vent to his emotions. “I have been given an opportunity to contest. Please bless me,” he said touching the feet of the people, clasping hands with them and pleading with them. The villagers reciprocated with some of them wiping their own tears when they saw Naik crying. Some villagers tried to console him. As Naik goes from village to village, he sticks to his unique campaign method: He would touch the feet of the people, he would cry and he would plead with them to vote for him. His campaigning style is only a spectacle for many but has also become a hot topic in the byelections. The BJP sprang a surprise by fielding the tribal doctor from the general seat. Naik was picked by the BJP despite two other serious contenders vying for the ticket. BJP rebel candidate Niveditha Reddy filed her nomination which, however, was rejected by the returning officer. Naik was associated with Congress earlier and had even worked actively with Congress candidate K Jana Reddy in the 2018 assembly elections. Jana Reddy had lost then. “It’s going to be a fight between ‘sishya’ and ‘guru’. But, we are confident,” a Naik supporter said. Jana Reddy (75), a veteran of many elections and a seven-time MLA, is in the fray again, while the TRS has fielded Nomula Bhagat, son of incumbent Nomula Narsimhaiah, who had passed away. As his voice has become hoarse because of constant shouting and crying, Naik is now showing the party symbol and urging the people to vote for the symbol. Amidst hectic campaigning, he does not forget to mention one thing to the electorate. “I am a doctor,” he tells wherever he goes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/naiks-s-weeping-formula-cry-fall-at-voters-feet/articleshow/81995409.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: CBI official nabs I-T inspector who took Rs 5L bribe after chase||Mumbai: A Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) official chased an Income-Tax (I-T) investigation wing inspector Ashish Kumar around for half a km and arrested him for accepting a Rs 5 lakh bribe from the owner of a logistic company on Thursday. CBI also arrested his colleague, inspector Dilip Kumar, that day while accepting Rs 10 lakh from the same person. CBI is investigating inspector S N Rai, who too had demanded a bribe from the complainant. It produced the two I-T inspectors in court, which remanded them to jail custody on Friday. CBI searched their homes and recovered Rs 7 lakh along with documents, including land purchase-related. The inspectors were attached to I-T investigation wing office at Ballard Pier and were part of a team that raided the logistic company recently for tax evasion. The three were calling the owner of the company separately, demanding bribes. The three were unaware about each others’ communication with the complainant, who approached the anti-corruption wing of CBI for help. CBI took the complainant into confidence and laid a trap for the two inspectors who had been caught red-handed with the bribe. Ashish Kumar had called the complainant near Oberoi Mall in Goregaon (E) on Thursday night and a CBI team laid a trap near the spot. They caught Ashish after he collected Rs 5 lakh from the complainant and kept it in his bag, but he flung the bag with money at the team and ran away. A team member chased him and nabbed him. Earlier, another team had arrested Dilip Kumar from Andheri while accepting a Rs 10 lakh bribe. CBI sources said Rai called the complainant for bribe negotiation but had not mentioned the amount.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cbi-official-nabs-i-t-inspector-who-took-rs-5l-bribe-after-chase/articleshow/81996244.cms||Vijay V Singh

He said they should exert pressure on chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to dole out unemployment allowance and also issue notifications to fill up 1.91 lakh vacancies in the government sector. The bypoll is on April 17 and counting of votes will be taken up on May 2. “The TRS government is not going to fall just because of losing one seat of Nagarjuna Sagar. It has over 100 MLAs on its side. But, a defeat will compel KCR to fulfill all his pending promises made to the people of Telangana,” said Prabhakar. Prabhakar, who is also the working president of the Congress in Telangana, took a dig at the chief minister’s decision to extend help to private teachers. “Had the CM taken this decision during lock down itself when the Congress made repeated pleas, many lives could have been saved,” he said. Stating that Biswal Commission submitted the pay revision report to the state government in December 2020 itself, the Congress leader said the report had mentioned that there are 1.91 lakh vacancies in the government sector. “CM KCR will not be able to escape from the wrath of the unemployed youth for failing to fill up all these vacancies,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ensure-defeat-of-trs-congress/articleshow/81995406.cms||---
---||Kochi||Surge in avg daily growth rate as state fails to keep vigil||Kochi: Kerala’s seven-day average daily growth rate of Covid cases that had come down to 0.17% in mid-March is now seeing an upward trend. Added with that is the high test positivity rate (TPR). The state’s seven-day average daily growth rate now is 0.27 % and seven-day average TPR is 5.9%. On Thursday, Kerala reported 4,353 new Covid cases and within a day the numbers jumped to 5,063 on Friday, that is more than double of what the state reported on April 1 (2,798 new cases), five days before the elections. Even the number of Covid deaths has increased within a span of a few days. While in the beginning of the month, the state had 11 Covid deaths, the number of Covid fatalities jumped to 18 on Thursday and 22 on Friday, raising concern among the public health experts about Kerala’s real Covid situation. “Daily cases in the last few days have been constantly increasing despite reduction in daily testing. Authorities were also indifferent to Covid-inappropriate behaviour. With the elections over, the health department is back to testing more and insisting on Covid-appropriate behaviour. But it will not really help and we can expect a bigger spike soon,” said health economist Rijo M John. “An infectious Indian variant is slowly spreading in Maharashtra and other states but it has not yet reached Kerala. But it will reach the state soon. Now, on an average, we see around 3,500 cases per day and it is expected to triple within a few weeks,” said internal medicine expert Dr Arun N M, who has been analysing the Covid death trend in Kerala. Incidentally, the advantages Kerala had in the first wave is now missing post-election. A good Covid surveillance system that was there in the state is no more existent. Majority of Covid war rooms in the districts are closed down and the health authorities have been focusing more on vaccination rather than on detection and isolation. Even random testing, especially in markets and crowded places, has come down. Unlike in the past, there are no frequent follow-ups with travellers, especially interstate travellers, to ensure whether they are following quarantine and testing norms. Also, during the election, there was blatant violation of SMS social distancing, masks and sanitisers even by politicians who insisted on the same in the past. This has also made people complacent. “The advantage we have now is the Covid vaccine. Also, Kerala has with it well-developed Covid protocols and systems in place. This needs to be activated, except that this time many people have been diverted for the vaccination drive. And that’s going to be a challenge,” said Dr Rakhal Gaitonde, professor, Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram. “We are seeing a slight increase in cases post-election but as of now we are in a good position. But how we manage ahead will depend on our surveillance. Our concern is that many people who are arriving from other states are not strictly following the quarantine norms or taking tests as mandated,” said Dr P K Jameela, former director, directorate of health services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/surge-in-avg-daily-growth-rate-as-state-fails-to-keep-vigil/articleshow/81994600.cms||Preetu Nair

---||Chandigarh||All for dedicated cluster for electroplating industry in cycle valley: PSEIC||Ludhiana: With the work of link road to cycle valley complete, the demand for setting up cluster for electroplating industry is gathering pace. Acoording to Punjab Small Industries and Export Corporation (PSEIC), it has already got memorandums from several business associations and the matter is being seriously considered. According to businessmen, if a dedicated cluster is setup for the electroplating industry it will do away with the problem of water pollution in the city and also give modern infrastructure to the electroplating units, which are unable to adapt to the modern techniques due to lack of space for expansion at their existing locations. Speaking to TOI, Gurpreet Gogi, chairman of PSIEC said, “Ever since the work of road leading to cycle valley has been completed, we have got several proposals from industry representatives for setting up cluster for different sectors or allotting land to particular industry. We are happy over the response received from the industry, but as of now we are only considering the setting up electroplating cluster at Dhanansu, as there is dire need for shifting electroplating units from Ludhiana to dedicated industrial area with all the modern facilities and Dhanansu Focal Point cum cycle valley is the perfect spot for it.” Gogi also added, “We are in touch with the industry representatives and soon a meeting will be called by PSIEC in which all the stakeholders will be called and next course of action will be taken based upon the discussions. As far as feasibility of this project is concerned, more than 500 acre of land is available at Dhanansu where industrial projects can be setup and electroplating cluster would only require about 50 to 100 acre land. The cluster would be win-win situation for industry and city as well because businessmen will be able to get access to modern infrastructure while the problem of water pollution in the city will be reduced.” According to Jagbir Singh Sokhi, president of Sewing Machine Development Club said, “Whether its sewing machine, bicycle or the auto parts industry, every industry is highly dependent on the electroplating industry. As of now majority of the units are located in congested and non designated industrial areas as a result they are facing huge problems related to infrastructure and cannot even expand or add modern technology easily. So, if a dedicated cluster for the electroplating industry is made at Dhanansu, it will solve all their problems and all sectors of industry will be benefitted due to this.” According to Kulpreet Malhotra Bunty, senior member of United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA), “Shifting of existing electroplating units and setting up of new and modern units at one place like Dhanansu which is having all infrastructure will prove to be immensely beneficial for these units, as these units will be able to get access to all the facilities like proper roads, water and labour, and at the same time their cost of doing business will also reduce. As of now, they have to incur huge expenditure on getting the treated water lifted from their factories and dispose it off scientifically, but setting up all these units in one area, they can build common disposal place and save money.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/all-for-dedicated-cluster-for-electroplating-industry-in-cycle-valley-pseic/articleshow/81993847.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Chandigarh||After protest, farmers take Rs 2.5L from Ropar mill||Patiala: Farmers blocked the Ropar-Chandigarh highway for around two hours on Friday to protest against a local private flour mill for purchasing wheat from outside Punjab. The farmers claimed they had confiscated around 44 trucks loaded with wheat on Thursday evening that were parked near a gurdwara. Farmers under Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) claimed they had staged a protest against the flour mill on Thursday evening, but police and district administration did not take action against the mill following which the farmers’ group decided to block the highway. Farmers said wheat was being purchased at cheaper prices from UP and other states where there was no MSP and those farmers were also being exploited by being made to sell produce at the lowest prices.The farmers agitating on the highway feared their wheat produce would not be procured if the private millers in Punjab will purchase wheat from outside Punjab. However, the district officials in Ropar said there would be no effect on farmers’ wheat procurement as it had no direct or indirect link with the procurement process in grain markets of Punjab or commission agents. “In the previous season, we sold our produce at lower prices after the millers refused to take more stock than their limits as they had already purchased the produce from outside Punjab. On Thursday, we confiscated these trucks near the flour mill and staged a protest but all in vain. Thus, we blocked the highway at 11.30am and lifted the protest at 1.30pm after getting an assurance from the district mandi officer over action in this regard,” said Daleep Singh, SKM leader and a member of Kulhind Kisan Sabha farmer union. Later, the agitating farmers struck a compromise with the flour mill owner who paid Rs 2.5 lakh as social fund for the farmers. The district administration acted as a negotiator to get the matter resolved. DMO Bhajan Kaur said that the trucks loaded with wheat produce were sent back, however no penalty or action could be taken against the flour mill owner as there was no illegality. She said the farmer leaders demanded fund for their morcha and the flour mill owner had agreed to pay Rs 2.5 lakh as social fund to the farmers. “The flour mill owner agreed to send the wheat-loaded trucks back to the traders outside Punjab. He also agreed to purchase wheat from the local mandis of Punjab and gave a social fund of Rs 2.5 lakh for the welfare of farmers.” SKM leader Daleep Singh said, “The flour mill owner met our demands, including payment of Rs 2.5 lakh as social fund for farmers. We will spend a major portion of this fund on purchase of necessary items like fans required at our agitation site on Delhi borders while some of the amount we may decide to meet the requirements of our union in relation with the protest.” However, SKM’s senior leaders condemned the move of taking money from the mill owner. Jagjit Singh Dallewal said such action of taking any social fund after protest would let down the farmers’ agitation. He said that farmers’ protest was justified as local arhtiyas used to take cheaper produce from traders outside Punjab via local flour millers and then show the purchase in name of Punjab farmers’ to mint money over MSP. BKU Ekta Dakaunda leader Jagmohan Singh termed the social fund move as corruption.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/after-protest-farmers-take-rs-2-5l-from-ropar-mill/articleshow/81995414.cms||---

All shops, except restaurants, hotels and dhabas, have been asked to close at 7pm till April 30. All shops must have sanitisers for the customers and mask is a must for all. But only 50% customers of the seating capacity will be allowed in restaurants, dhabas and cinema halls. All religious places will be closed for common people while mask is a must in parks and gardens. “The order to close all schools, colleges and coaching institutes in the state from April 5 to April 11 has been extended for one more week,” CM Nitish Kumar said on Friday while briefing the media about the steps his government is taking to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, pre-scheduled examinations would be held amid strict enforcement of Covid-19 guidelines like wearing of masks and maintaining social distancing, a senior official said. Health department’s principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit said 9 lakh doses of vaccines reached Patna on Friday afternoon and there was no shortage of vaccines in the state. No gathering is allowed at public places while only 50 guests in a ‘shradh’ and 200 in wedding functions are allowed. Public transport has restriction to carry only 50% passengers of the seating capacity. The CM further said the state government is reviewing the Covid-19 situation on a daily basis. If the situation deteriorates further, the government might think of imposing night curfew. However, no decision has been taken yet on enforcing night curfew in the state. Nitish also revealed that altogether 17 train passengers from Maharashtra were found positive during their screening at a local railway station on Friday. The CM further said that all train passengers returning to Bihar from Maharashtra would be tested at the railway stations for Covid-19. He said necessary arrangements had been made at railways stations for testing of passengers. The train passengers, who would be found Covid-19 positive, would be sent to the isolation centres, while those found negative would be allowed to go home but with certain instructions like to keep themselves isolated for a few days. The CM also announced that the state government would soon convene an all-party meeting to be chaired by the governor to take views of different political parties on how to tackle the pandemic. Nitish said PM Narendra Modi, during his videoconference with the CMs on Thursday, suggested that the state governments should convene all-party meetings under the chairmanship of the respective governor. “We spoke to governor Phagu Chauhan on this issue. The all-party meet will be convened in the next few days. The date will be announced soon,” the CM said. Nitish also said as per the PM’s suggestion, the state government would launch a special vaccination drive from April 11 to 14. Four lakh people per day would be vaccinated in the state during the four-day special drive, he said. “The PM said during the meeting that April 11 is the birth anniversary of social reformer Jyotirao Phule, while April 14 is the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar. We should observe “Tika Utsav” from April 11 to 14,” the CM said. Earlier in the day, Nitish held a high-level meeting with top officials to review the Covid-19 scenario in the state. Several decisions regarding the enforcement of certain restrictions were taken at the meeting. Speaking at the meeting, Nitish stressed the need of increasing the number of testing and vaccination across the state. He asked the officials to make necessary arrangements to open quarantine centres at subdivision level. Pratyaya made a detailed presentation about the latest position of Covid-19 in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/schools-colleges-to-remain-closed-till-april-18-nitish/articleshow/81994607.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Kochi||Polls, festivals trigger Covid spike in Thrissur||THRISSUR: Covid-19 cases in the Thrissur district have quadrupled since mid-March. The health authorities attribute the spike to the violation of Covid protocols during the assembly elections and the various festivals held during the period. While the number of positive cases had declined to under 100 by the middle of March, touching as low as 78 on March 15, it has been steadily rising ever since and reached 414 on Friday. District Medical Officer (DMO) Dr KJ Reena said that the test positivity rate that had gone down to 1.3% mid-March reached 7.3% on Friday. District collector S Shanavas had directed all polling agents, who were active during the assembly polls, to take the Covid-19 vaccine immediately. According to official sources, there were 3,858 polling stations in the district and at least eight activists were deployed as polling agents in each station by various candidates and political parties. Going by the numbers, almost 31,000 polling agents should have taken their vaccines in the last two days since the election. However, health authorities have confirmed that there was no indication of a large-scale flow of activists for vaccination. It is understood that Covid protocols were hardly observed during recent festivals of Uthralikkavu Pooram and Arattupuzha Pooram. The Thrissur Pooram organizers have, meanwhile, said they would adhere to the Covid protocol, though doubts have been raised from many quarters about how it can be made practical. Thrissur Pooram exhibition committee president Satheesh Menon said there will be strict monitoring of the visitors reaching the exhibition hall. "There will be facilities for thermal scanning. The number of stalls has been reduced from 300 to 114. The parasols exchanged during Kudamattam will be restricted to 25-30; it used to be 55-60 in the previous editions of the festival," Menon said. Exhibition committee secretary V Ramkumar added that facilities to provide free Covid-19 vaccination for persons above 45 will be available on the exhibition ground. The Guruvayur Devaswom has decided to restrict the Vishukkani programme this year to mere rituals given the rise in Covid cases. Devotees will not be allowed inside the Nalambalam. Meanwhile, vaccination numbers have increased in the district, with official data showing 24,000 persons were vaccinated on Thursday. The cumulative figure for vaccinations done to date is 4,35044. "We have set a target of vaccinating 36,000 people per day in the coming days so that we can complete the vaccination of all the people above 45 in Thrissur by April end,’’ the DMO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/polls-festivals-trigger-spike-in-thrissur/articleshow/81994606.cms||T Ramavarman
---||Chennai||Preserving fragile repositories of knowledge on palm leaves||From astronomy to literature, mathematics and history, ancient Indian texts were written on birch bark in north India, using the surface painting method, while in the south they were engraved on palm leaves, using a stylus. These repositories of knowledge, today have a limited number of restorers and readers. "While birch bark, because of its bitter taste, is not attacked much by insects, palm leaves are attacked by fungus, cockroaches and book worms," says P Perumal, retired conservator and librarian of the 17 th century Saraswathi Mahal Library in Thanjavur, which has 24,000 palm leaf manuscripts. "Yet, with proper handling, palm leaves will easily last for 500 years," he says. The oldest manuscript in the library is a 11th century commentary on Jaimini Sutra. "At least 30% of Sanskrit manuscripts in Tamil Nadu remain undocumented, and many of these are in private collections," says Perumal. A window to knowledge unknown to the West, manuscripts evoked interest among the British as well. The manuscript collections of Mackenzie, Leyden and C P Brown, all three employed in the East India Company, formed the nucleus of the Government Oriental Manuscripts library, established in the 19th century, in Madras. "In the past, manuscripts were stored in wooden cupboards, in rooms with thatched roofs. This protected them from contraction during summer and expansion due to moisture absorption during the monsoon, and ensured that the structure of the manuscripts was intact. Sometimes, the first and last leaves of a manuscript bundle were coated in red colour because red repels insects. For this, china grass was heated, red colour was added to the resulting gel, and the bundle was coated on both sides with this gel. Further, manuscripts were tied in red cotton or silk cloth," says Perumal. Today, publications of manuscripts are required to create awareness about the wealth of information in these palm leaves. The U Ve Sa library in Chennai, which houses U Ve Swaminatha Iyer’s manuscript collections, has to its credit many publications. "Our last publication in 2018 was from Swaminatha Iyer’s palm leaf collection. It was an 18th century work titled ‘108 Tirupati Vanna Virutham’, which has verses about the 108 important Vaishnava temples," says G Uthiradam, curator of the library. K V Sarma Research foundation in Adyar, Chennai, houses copies of palm leaf manuscripts that Sarma sourced from various parts of Kerala. Mamata Dash, secretary and managing trustee of the foundation, has just completed editing scholar Suryadeva Yajvan’s (1191-1250) commentary on ‘Laghumanasa’, a Sanskrit work on astronomy. "There are four available manuscripts of Suryadeva Yajvan’s commentary, all of them in the Malayalam script. Scholar K V Sarma copied two of the palm leaf manuscripts, and began the work of editing. I have completed the editing," says Mamata. The work will soon be published by the Tata Trust. Descriptive catalogues help when critical editions have to be brought out. A descriptive catalogue gives details like title of the work, author’s name, the name of the scribe who made the copy, the length and breadth of the manuscript, the number of leaves in the bundle, and the first and last lines of the text, and the date and year according to the Hindu almanac, which is engraved on the manuscript. But it is difficult to put together a descriptive catalogue, says R K Narayanan, a scholar in Melkote Academy of Sanskrit research. "There is a shortage of manuscriptologists. Old Sanskrit works were written mostly in grantha. Just because a person can read grantha in print, it does not mean he can read grantha in palm leaves, because the strokes differ. Moreover, the same person will not be conversant with different subjects. Sometimes it may seem that a manuscript belongs to the category of logic, but it may be a work on Vedanta. A word may be illegible in a manuscript, and we need to guess what word comes there. In all such cases, only a subject expert can help," he says. This shows the need for manuscriptology being offered as a separate subject for those majoring in Indian languages, or those who study epigraphy. Melkote academy has come out with 12 descriptive catalogues, and another six are in the pipeline. How long would it take for a descriptive catalogue to be prepared? "If there are, say, 100 manuscripts pertaining to a subject, it could easily take a year," says Narayanan. In 2003, the National Manuscripts Mission (NMM) was established by Prime Minister A B Vajpayee, to preserve India’s manuscript wealth. Manuscript resource and conservation centres were roped in as partners and manuscriptologists give monthly talks. With digitisation, one does not have to fear that manuscript contents will be lost. But the manuscripts must continue to be preserved. Abroad manuscripts are encased in containers, filled with an inert gas like helium or nitrogen, and airconditioners run throughout the day in museums. Sadly, in India, air conditioners are switched off when the museum closes, says Perumal. "We must have 24-hour air conditioning, with a thermo hygrograph, to ensure proper temperature and humidity, as we have done in Ramana ashram, Tiruvannamalai," he says.

However, AIUDF president and Badruddin Ajmal’s millionaire brother, Sirajuddin, has not joined the group. The three-phase election in Assam got over on April 6. The “mahajot’s” other major ally, the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) led by Hagrama Mohilary, has also shifted all its 11 candidates to a hotel in Kokrajhar, also fearing horse-trading. The AIUDF MLAs were accompanied by AICC secretary and co-in-charge of Assam Prithiviraj Sathe in the same flight from Guwahati to Jaipur. Meanwhile, AIUDF turncoat Aziz Khan, who contested on an AGP ticket from Karimganj South after being denied a ticket by Ajmal, on Friday visited his former party chief at his home here. Both Khan and Ajmal said the conversation was not on horse-trading but was a chat between two old friends. Congress minority leader and former minister Rakibul Hussain said, “It is certain that the NDA will not form the government. The ‘mahajot’ is winning the elections. I will not be surprised if there is a reverse flow of NDA MLAs to the mahajot.” “This is not Manipur where BJP can play foul and form government,” added Hussain, referring to Congress failing to form the government despite being the single-largest group and falling short of a simple majority by just three seats in 2017. “On May 2, we’ll form the government. Those who’ve a habit of horse-trading will do so. Till now, BJP hasn’t approached us but it certainly will. The day we form the government, BJP will contact us,” said Ajmal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/assam-polls-over-congress-packs-off-18-aiudf-candidates-to-rajasthan/articleshow/81998310.cms||Prabin Kalita
---||Dehradun||Farmers oppose minister's entry into Roorkee village||ROORKEE: Farmers' unions on Thursday waved black flags at minister Swami Yatishwaranand when he was about to attend a village function near Roorkee. Over 100 farmers - protesting against the three farm laws - held a sit-in protest at Jhabrera police station for two hours and warned the government against the entry of the minister in the village. Sources said the minister of state (independent charge) Yatishwaranand was on way to a felicitation event at Manakpur village under Jhabrera police station via Bhagwanpur route. Farmers under the banner of Sanyukt Kishan Morcha were carrying the black flags. They were stopped by police at Jhabrera. The police then managed to get the minister out from a different route in Manakpur village. "The farmers ended their sit-in after submitting a memorandum to the local administration. They were carrying black flags. But, the protest remained peaceful," said Ravindra Kumar, in-charge of Jhabrera police station.  "BJP governments, be it Centre or state, have ruined the farm sector. So, we are boycotting the minister till our fellow farmers end their protests at Delhi borders. If ministers try to enter the village, we will resist," said Gulshan Rod, head of UKM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/farmers-oppose-ministers-entry-into-roorkee-village/articleshow/81987832.cms||Tapan Susheel
---||Chandigarh||Bizmen demand lowering age limit for vaccination||Ludhiana: To support the vaccination drive of the government, business associations and factory owners are organising large number of camps in which already thousands of workers, businessmen, their families and general public has been vaccinated. But in the wake of huge rise in the cases of Covid-19, the demand for allowing the persons below the age of 45 years to get vaccinated is rising. According to businessmen, a large number of workers and entrepreneurs are below the age of 45 years and, given their work profile of meeting large number of people daily, they need to be vaccinated at the earliest. Speaking on the issue, Hemant Abbi, executive member of the Moti Nagar United Factory Association, said, “There is steep rise in the cases and fatalities too are increasing day by day. Vaccination seems to be the only solution to safeguard one against this pandemic and great work is being done by the government. But capping of the age is acting as a hindrance in the efforts of the government, as huge number of people remain uncovered because persons below the age of 45 years are still not eligible for the vaccination.” Abbi also added, “Huge number of industry’s workforce and their immediate family members are below the age of 45 years and due to this they still have not got dose of vaccine shot. Workers are at high risk of Covid-19 because they come in contact with large number of persons daily therefore they should be administered the dose of coronavirus immediately. We request the government and authorities to allow vaccination of persons below the age of 45 at the earliest as along with ensuring safety of workers it will also help in coverage of majority of the population.” According to Abhinav Sehgal, executive member of Ludhiana Business Forums, “In addition to the workers, there is huge number of entrepreneurs in the city and elsewhere who are below the age of 45 years. Moreover, the work profile of the businessmen is such that in a day they have to meet many people. So, there is high risk of contracting Covid-19, which has become more dangerous in its second wave. So vaccination for people below 45 is need of the hour and we are even willing to pay for it and we request the government to lift the restrictions on age for getting a jab.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bizmen-demand-lowering-age-limit-for-vaccination/articleshow/81993854.cms||Mohit Behl

AAP MLAs Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer and Amarjeet Singh Sandoa said both the governments were working in tandem and befooling the farmers and arhtiyas. “Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh has been making false promises to farmers for a long time, that there will be no direct payment this season. But now his ministers are denying it. It is unfortunate that during the recent meeting of three Punjab ministers with Goyal, the CM did not taken a firm stand for Punjab. Like Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Amarinder Singh is also lying at every step,” they alleged. The AAP leaders further said that Modi had claimed and promised in the Parliament that there is and will be MSP on crops, but the farmers of Punjab seized hundreds of trolleys loaded with wheat at various places, which was procured from other states at a price lower than the MSP and exposed Prime Minister’s false claims and promises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dbt-to-stay-aap-blames-ministers/articleshow/81995422.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Rs 2k, 25kg rice to teachers from Apr 20||Hyderabad: The Telangana government has decided to hand over Rs 2,000 financial assistance to teachers and staffers working with various private educational institutions from April 20. Following the decision of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to help private schools teachers, education minister P Sabitha Indra Reddy, BC welfare and civil supplies minister Gangula Kamalakar and chief advisor Rajiv Sharma held a video conference with district collectors on extending the financial help to the teachers. They asked the collectors to ensure that 25 kg fine rice and Rs 2,000 per month is distributed to teaching and non-teaching staff working in all recognised private schools. Sabitha Reddy said the collectors should utilise the database available with the education department pertaining to the private schools and take care in identifying the beneficiaries. The education department will send a link to all the districts through which the data should be uploaded between April 10 and 15. “Scrutiny and grievance redressal will be done from April 16 to 19. The amounts will be deposited directly into the beneficiaries’ bank accounts between April 20 and 24. Similarly, rice will also be distributed to the beneficiaries through fair price shops during these days,” the minister said. She said the scheme would continue till the schools reopen. Kamalakar said that sufficient stocks of rice are available at all the mandal-level stock points. “The collectors can also utilise the rice distributed to the schools two months ago,” he said. The collectors need to work out a system to provide rice to those who do not have a ration card and ensure that no genuine beneficiary is left out, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rs-2k-25kg-rice-to-teachers-from-apr-20/articleshow/81995425.cms||---
---||Mumbai||How is it that a neta is given a jab at home: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: “How is it that for political leaders the policy is different,” the Bombay high court asked on Friday when informed of news reports that a leader in Maharashtra was given Covid vaccine at home. The HC was hearing a public interest litigation filed for its intervention to allow door-to-door jabs for the very elderly, bed-ridden and physically challenged. Advocates Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal had filed it to seek improvements in facilities for those aged over 75 and home-bound people.Kapadia, without mentioning NCP chief Sharad Pawar, who got the jab at home earlier this week, said, “We have been reading in the news that home vaccination has taken place.” The bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni quickly asked the state government, which is a party to the PIL, “How is it that a political leader is given a jab at home?” The bench too did not mention Pawar’s name. The CJ orally observed, “When we had asked the BMC commissioner to turn the HC medical room into a camp for lawyers and court staff over 45, he had expressed an inability since there was no Intensive Care Unit... Is an ICU facility made available at the residence of the political leaders?” The HC said the PIL is not adversarial litigation. It told state government pleader Purnima Kantharia, “Whatever has happened has happened. Next time, if we find that any politician gets a jab at home, we will handle it. If PM and President of India can go to the hospital for the vaccine, why not leaders of Maharashtra?” ASG Anil Singh and counsel Advait Sethna for the Centre tendered an ‘internal note’ to the bench and submitted its policy doesn’t permit ‘door-to-door’ vaccinations. The reason is that a doctor’s presence at the vaccination centres is a must since each recipient needs to wait for 30 minutes at the centre to ensure no adverse effects for inoculation (AEFI) occur, and if they do, they can be managed on site.

The special court (POCSO Act) of ADJ-VI Awadhesh Kumar also imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 on the septuagenarian convict.

---||Chandigarh||Take strict action against hospitals without ETPs: DC to PPCB||Ludhiana: Deputy commissioner (DC) Varinder Kumar Sharma on Friday directed Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) to take strictest action against the hospitals operating without effluent treatment plants (ETPs) in the district. Presiding over a meeting of the district environment committee, DC Sharma said the last deadline for installing the ETP was March 31 and those hospitals that have not set up the facility will face action according to the laws. He asked the PPCB to conduct the physical inspection of the institutions and ensure proper compliance with the bio-medical waste management rules. Deputy commissioner also expressed his displeasure over the poor functioning of some department in taking action against illegal colonies, dairies, and other structures surrounding Buddha Nullah and said he would send a report to their high-ups about inaction. He said the Punjab government is committed to clean Buddha Nullah and has already launched a Rs 650-crore project for its rejuvenation and any type of laxity will not be tolerated at any cost. He said the state government has also sanctioned a project of development of a 66-kV substation for common effluent treatment plants (CETPs) to keep check the discharge of untreated domestic and partially treated domestic and industrial effluent directly into the nullah and work would start soon. The DC further asked the officers to complete the ongoing construction of new STPs in various towns of the district at the earliest. He said besides solving the sewerage problem of the concerned areas, these would also help to make the district clean and green. He also reviewed the functioning of the solid waste management programme, including door-to-door collection, waste segregation, action against plastic, and others of the municipal corporation and other councils. He also asked the officials to make a comprehensive strategy to ensure none of the farmers indulge in the stubble burning in the upcoming wheat harvesting season. He said every project needs to be completed in a time-bound manner and asked the officials to give ‘top priority to the environment so that we can give a safe future to the coming generations. He said it is the need of the hour to give a major fillip to the overall development of the areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/take-strict-action-against-hospitals-without-etps-dc-to-ppcb/articleshow/81993863.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The couple took a bus and an auto to reach the centre. “Why is the government asking everybody to get vaccinated if there are no doses left?” she said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-if-no-stock-why-ask-to-get-vax/articleshow/81996299.cms||---
---||Mumbai||No jabs at city’s pvt booths till Mon as vax shortage shuts 70% centres||MUMBAI: Covid vaccination in the city dropped by 40% on Friday as 86 of the 120 inoculation centres closed due to unavailability of doses. Thousands had to be turned away and centres that operated saw winding queues. BMC chief I S Chahal said all 71 private centres will be shut on April 10, 11 and 12. Public centres will run—normally on Sunday, but reduced hours on Saturday. “Citizens can travel to vaccination centres during the lockdown,” he clarified. The state too witnessed a dip of over a lakh in vaccination from the daily average of 4.27 lakh. The state got 4.59 lakh vaccine doses on Friday, which could run for 2-3 days at most, said officials. The city got around 99,000 doses, which civic officials said would mainly be diverted to the public vaccination centres. The vaccine shortage meant Mumbai could vaccinate only 33,551 on Friday, down from its daily average of 53,000 vaccinations since April 1 (see box). The city had started Friday’s drive with less than enough doses, and the crisis began to unfold by noon as some of the major public vaccination facilities started running out. The largest centre at the BKC jumbo facility shut its gates after it exhausted the last of its 160 doses around 11.30am. Since news of vaccine shortage was relayed a couple of days ago, crowds had been rushing to centre in panic. People continued to pour in despite notices about the stockout, and the cops had to be called in. By afternoon, the access road to the centre was barricaded. At the Nesco jumbo facility in Goregaon, the main gates had to be shut around 2 pm. Minor scuffles broke out near the gate as people still wanted to enter the premises. Similar scenes played out at VN Desai Hospital in Santacruz, where less than 300 could be vaccinated. The hospital’s cramped campus was filled with hundreds more, who had to leave disappointed. SevenHills Hospital in Marol, which vaccinates up to 3,500 in a day, had put up banners announcing the stockout. State officials said despite the crunch, Maharashtra continued to be ahead of other states having administered over 97 lakh doses on Friday. Before the start of the day’s drive, Maharashtra had around 10 lakh doses of vaccine. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said people needn’t worry as they will be vaccinated once stocks arrive. “There is no need to panic as doses will come shortly. People waiting for a second dose of Covishield can anyway take it between 6-8 weeks,” he said. Private vaccination centres have been shut for the weekend, but will resume normal operations next week as more vaccines arrive. Four workers from the BMC’s solid waste management who came to the BKC centre for their second dose said they were surprised to see no vaccines for frontliners. Laxman Bhide had brought his 80-year-old mother hoping to get her vaccinated. “I should have got her earlier. Who knew the stocks would run out?” said the Kurla resident. Reports of stockouts came from MMR too. After Vasai-Virar, Mira Bhayander officials said till Friday, they have almost exhausted their stock of 1.02 lakh vaccines. Vaccination at three private hospitals in Kalyan-Dombivli was closed due to the shortage. The remaining 19 centres have doses for only the next two days. The three centres which are closed include AIMS hospital (Dombivli), Mamta Hospital (Dombivli) and Siddhivinayak hospital (Kalyan).

Police recovered six cars and a bike from the accused, G Mahesh Nuthan Kumar. Police said the accused would submit stolen ID proofs while taking the vehicles on rent. “The accused would detach the GPS from the stolen vehicles and sell them to people he knew. He would also replace the original number plate with a fake one,” Cyberabad police commissioner VC Sajjanar said. Mahesh started committing offences in 2016 by stealing mobile phones from showrooms. He first stole a car from a car rental company in 2018. In June 2019, the accused shared a room in Panjagutta with Nagendra Prasad and stole Rs 1.60 lakh cash, besides Aadhaar card, driving licence and other items of Prasad. From Hyderabad, Mahesh went to Bengaluru where he rented a high-end bike by using the stolen ID proofs of Prasad. The accused then went to Visakhapatnam where he shared a room with two others. “Through room sharing apps, Mahesh would rent a room with others and after a few days, he would steal the roommates’ valuables, including ID proofs,” police said. Mahesh moved to places like Pune, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Kerala while committing the offences. The accused also went to Chennai where he took a car on rent with a stolen ID proof and came to Hyderabad. Suspecting that the rental companies might track him if he uses the same ID proofs, Mahesh gave an ad on an e-commerce site seeking a driver. When a driver from Yadadri district contacted Mahesh, he collected the driver’s ID proofs and stole another rental car.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/man-arrested-for-stealing-rental-vehicles/articleshow/81995471.cms||---

Chhabria is accused of taking Rs 5.7 crore from Sharma for a vanity van but not delivering it. Sharma, who had lodged a police complaint in January, told police he had paid Rs 5.3 crore to Chhabria for the van between May 2017 and May 2018. He said Chhabria demanded Rs 40 lakh more for GST, which he paid. But he did not get his van even after making all payments, he said. Chhabria reportedly asked for Rs 60 lakh more, so Sharma then approached the police. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/chargesheet-filed-in-rs-5-7cr-chhabria-case-in-mumbai/articleshow/81996379.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Emaar case: HC to hear ED’s arguments on April 16||Hyderabad: Justice G Sri Devi of the Telangana high court on Friday posted to April 16 a petition filed by Koneru Madhu, an accused in the Emaar scam money laundering case registered by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for hearing the probe agency’s argument. Madhu is urging the court to quash the ED case against him because the CBI case against him was already quashed. “CBI case is the basis for ED to launch its process. Since the basis itself has gone, the ED case has no legs to stand on its own now, it has to go,” Mukul Rohatgi, the senior counsel from Supreme Court said. The ED has made out no case against him, and the probe agencies say that two Emaar plot buyers, Parthasarathi and Challa Suresh, deposited Rs 1.05 crore and Rs 65 lakh, respectively, in Madhu’s Dubai bank account. This, according to the investigators, was done at the behest of prime accused Koneru Rajendra Prasad. Madhu is the son of Prasad. Arguing the case of Madhu, Rohatgi said that the ED never said that Madhu was part of any money laundering conspiracy. “There is no prior meeting of minds. Madhu has been in Dubai for the last 30 years and receiving money is not an offence. Moreover, even this money was later refunded to the senders on December 14, 2011, itself,” Rohatgi said, adding that there is no proof to show that the father and son had entered into a conspiracy. This case, according to observers, will be an interesting one because ED has to prove its case without the support of the CBI case. Of late, ED has been insisting in many cases that its proceedings are independent of other cases registered by the CBI, etc, and even assertively urging the trial courts that the trial in its case must begin first and the trial by CBI court in the same case should follow it. In Madhu’s case, though it is part of a larger Emaar case where the trial against the other accused is still pending before the CBI court, the case filed by CBI against him was already quashed by the high court. Now, only the case filed by ED is still there. The high court had earlier stayed the proceedings before the ED court in respect of Madhu. Upon a request from Avinash Desai, the counsel for Madhu at the high court, the judge extended it till the next date of hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/emaar-case-hc-to-hear-eds-arguments-on-april-16/articleshow/81995464.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Tempers run high at Ambala grain market as farmers, arhtiyas face off||Ambala: A group of farmers associated with BKU (Charuni) got into an argument with arhtiyas at Ambala City grain market on Friday, telling them to start filling wheat in gunny bags when the latter (arhtiyas) were on strike. Led by BKU Haryana (Charuni) Ambala block-I leader Jai Singh Jalbera, farmers had a verbal spat with Haryana State Arhtiyas Association chief patron Duni Chand over the issue. While many farmers have already brought their wheat to the grain market, the stock is not being procured. Farmers demanded that their crop be purchased and alleged that the government has failed to streamline the process. Jai Singh reached the grain market after some farmers who had been waiting for the lifting of their crop since the previous night reported the matter to him. Meanwhile, Duni Chand maintained that due to the statewide strike by arhtiyas, they cannot start lifting the crop. BKU Haryana (Charuni) Ambala district president Malkiat Singh Sahibpura said, “We support the statewide agitation of arhtiyas and demand from the government to resume the old system. Some farmers who had reached the market with crops are worried about procurement and indulged in a spat with the arhtiya leader. But there is no difference between arhtiyas and farmers.” Officials claimed to have started wheat procurement through agencies like food and civil supplies and consumer affairs department, Haryana Warehousing Corporation and Hafed. As per data released by deputy commissioners, 17,265MT wheat has been procured in Kurukshetra, 15,028MT in Yamunanagar and 27,226.3MT in Ambala till Friday afternoon. Additional chief secretary of employment, mining and housing for all T C Gupta and Yamunanagar DC Mukul Kumar also inspected the ongoing process at Jagadhri grain market on. Regarding the arhtiyas’ strike, Gupta said, “The government is holding discussions with the representatives of arhtiyas and some solution is expected soon. The government is committed to purchasing wheat from farmers... It is the Centre’s decision to deposit the amount directly into the account of farmers and the state government is extending all possible cooperation to farmers and arhtiyas.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/tempers-run-high-at-ambala-grain-market-as-farmers-arhtiyas-face-off/articleshow/81995486.cms||---

He added that, if required, the local bodies can even call junior and assistant PWD engineers to do the checking. “If there is a problem in the quality of the water, then it should be sent to the junior engineer for further testing,” Sawant said, adding that the state has set up laboratories at the places where water is sourced. “Under the Jal Jeevan mission we will provide pure water,” he said. “Goa is the first state to implement Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘har ghar nal se jal’ scheme. When we say we provide ‘har ghar nal se jal’, we have to have better testing facilities and provide good water. This is the responsibility of the state government.” Modi launched the scheme considering the shortage of drinking water across the country, Sawant said stressing on the importance of the principle of reduce, reuse and recycle. Do not waste treated water supplied to your households by using it for gardening and washing vehicles, he said. “We supply purified water which people in other states are not able to get. That water should not be used for gardening and washing vehicles,” he said, directing panchs to tell people in their villages not to waste treated water. Two vans will be dispatched to visit all the 191 panchayats to create awareness on water, Sawant said, after launching the Information, Education, Communication and Capacity Building Programme organised under the Jal Jeevan Mission.  The chief minister said that panchayats in association with local groups should shoulder the responsibility of making the Swayampurna Goa Mission a success. “If we take the responsibility on our own shoulders then only Goa can become Swayampurna,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-has-provided-panchayats-with-kits-to-test-water-sawant/articleshow/81996343.cms||---

The vessel, which ran aground in the Suez Canal and blocked traffic for six days, is currently at the Great Bitter Lake where it sailed to after it was refloated. An additional master, who is believed to be from India, joined the ship on April 4. “He joined the vessel to assist and provide support to the present master who has been supervising and coordinating crew efforts since response operations began,” a spokesperson of Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM) informed TOI in response to queries that were sent. From the Great Bitter Lake which is also part of the Suez Canal, the ship is expected to undertake a journey to Port Said in the northern end of the Suez Canal. The ship will undergo a re-inspection there. “The American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) completed its surveys on April 4 and issued a certificate of fitness to allow the vessel to move from Great Bitter Lake to Port Said. The vessel will move on from Great Bitter Lake subject to approval from the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) whose investigations are continuing for the moment,” the spokesperson said. According to sources, if a ship is involved in any mishap, the master is usually changed. There are 25 Indian crew aboard ‘Ever Given’, including the Master, who is now under investigation for the mishap in the Suez Canal. The SCA has been speaking to the Master as part of the investigation to get to understand how the ‘Ever Given’ went aground on March 23. The vessel was given a refloat with several agencies involved on March 29. Meanwhile, Abuldgani Serang, general secretary and treasurer of National Union of Seafarers of India, Abdulgani Y Serang on Friday said he had spoken to the captain of ‘Ever Given’. “Spoke with the Captain of “Ever Given” which is still under inquiry by the Suez Canal authorities. All seafarers onboard are fine and eagerly waiting to resume sailing again. Again assured him all support of the Indian fraternity,” he said. Serang, however, did not give out the name of the captain in his tweet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ever-given-gets-addl-captain-also-from-india/articleshow/81996314.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The SC had in 2015 directed that RBI can’t refuse to reveal information under the transparency law on financial health of banks under the pretext of ‘fiduciary relations’ with financial institutions and had held that the regulator was supposed to “uphold public interest and not the interest of banks”. Another round of litigation was initiated after RBI didn’t comply with the SC order and the court issued contempt notice. The proceedings were wound up in 2019 with RBI being given the last opportunity to comply to disclose its Annual Financial Inspection report of banks. With RBI asking the banks to provide information to be disclosed under the RTI Act, third round of litigations has started with all major banks filing fresh applications and petitions seeking quashing or recall of earlier direction. Banks such as SBI, PNB, HDFC, Bank of India, Bank of Baroda made a pitch for re-examining the issue. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta with advocates Harish Salve and Mukul Rohatgi contended before a bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Vineet Saran the banking industry could be affected and the SC order might be misused for corporate rivalry. They said only RBI was heard by the SC and the banks were not parties in the litigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cant-reveal-info-of-customers-recall-rti-order-banks-tell-sc/articleshow/81998313.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||Hyderabad||Prince Philip toured Hyderabad twice, once with queen||HYDERABAD: Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, who passed away in London on Friday, had visited Hyderabad twice. However, he was accompanied by his wife, Queen Elizabeth II, only once to the ‘pearl city’. The royal couple had visited India thrice – in 1959, 1983 and 1997. While the Prince was accompanied by the Queen during the 1983 visit to Hyderabad, he came alone to the city in 1997. Old-timers recall that though the Queen and the Prince were in Hyderabad in November 1983, their first-ever visit to Hyderabad, they attended most of the programmes separately. They were together only at a couple of events. City historian MA Qayyum, who served as the deputy director of state archaeology department, was present at the Qutub Shahi tombs when the Queen visited the world’s largest royal necropolis on November 9, 1983.  “The Queen came alone to the tombs. The Prince was visiting some other place in the city then. I had explained to her the significance of the Qutub Shahi regime and their tombs. The Queen had a glimpse of the Charminar using military binoculars. She also saw the Fateh Rahbar cannon and the Golconda Fort through the optical aid,” Qayyum told TOI. Qayyum, who had accompanied several dignitaries including Prince Charles and Princess Diana during their visit to Hyderabad in 1992, recalled that while Queen Elizabeth II remained quiet at the tombs, Prince Charles had enquired about the gate through which Mughal emperor Aurangzeb entered the Golconda Fort in 1687 and defeated Qutub Shahi king Tana Shah. According to INTACH city convener P Anuradha Reddy, Prince Philip had accompanied the Queen during the visit to the International Crops Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) in 1983. “The Prince attended a reception at the Jubilee Hall in 1997. He was 76 then. I remember seeing him with a pair of bullocks at the event. The Queen visited the Trinity Church,” she said. Dr P Raghu Ram, director of KIMS-Usha Lakshmi Centre for Breast Diseases, who received Officer of the Most Excellent Order of British Empire (OBE), said Prince Philip was the longest-serving consort of any British monarch. He was an outspoken ‘no nonsense’ Prince Charming and backbone to the royal family. “My prayers are with Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and the royal family at this most difficult time,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/prince-philip-toured-hyd-twice-once-with-queen/articleshow/81995503.cms||Syed Akbar

Both are in the critical care unit.” As these workers were temporary labourers, there is no provision of compensation to them in the rules. However, taking note of the issue, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who also holds the forest ministry, announced an ex-gratia of Rs5 lakh each to the next of kin of the victims. The expenses for treatment of the injured labourers will also be borne by the state government. Nilesh Gawande, general secretary of the Forest Rangers Association Maharashtra (FRAM), has also announced that FRAM will assist their families with ex-gratia of Rs1 lakh each to the kin, and Rs50,000 to the family of the injured. There were protests and kin of one of the victims, Shrirange from Kosamtondi, demanded Rs10 lakh compensation and a job to the next of kin. They refused to take possession of the body, forcing officials to announce a package. Shrirange was married on March 18, 2021. After learning about the tragedy, Thadezari villagers vent ire on forest staff and allegedly manhandled a forest guard. The mob also damaged a forest vehicle. NNTR field director & conservator of forest (CF) M Ramanujam said overall Rs10 lakh package will be given. It includes Rs5 lakh from CM’s fund and remaining Rs5 lakh will come from local MLA Manohar Chandrikapure, NNTR Foundation, NGOs, and forest unions. “We will send a proposal to offer a job in the department as a special case,” he added. The man-made fire was first noticed around 11.30am on Thursday in compartment numbers 97, 98, 99 & 100 under Nagzira and Pitezari forest ranges. Over 70 forest workers and employees were engaged in fighting the fires. “By evening the fire was mostly brought under control, but due to strong winds for 30 minutes it again spread and the labourers caught between two small hills. They were surrounded by the and couldn’t escape even as they tried hard to douse the surface fires with the help of blowers,” said Ramanujam. However, one theory by locals goes to say that the victims were dousing flames by fire-blowers when the blowers caught fire and there was a blast engulfing the victims. Ramanujam says, “This aspect will also be probed during the inquiry.” NNTR and its buffer zone has always been vulnerable to fires owing to tremendous pressure from mahua and tendu collectors. Two days ago, in a similar incident, a van majoor was injured while fighting fires on Khairi-Pitezari road. The victim is undergoing treatment at a rural hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/3-forest-labourers-burnt-to-death-in-major-nagzira-sanctuary-fire/articleshow/81995500.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The highest single-day spike for the city last year was 931, which was recorded on October 31. The city also recorded six deaths on Friday. With the number of active cases shooting up rapidly every day, hospitals are staring at an acute bed crisis. While some hospitals are ramping up beds, others are facing a challenge since most of their non-Covid beds remain occupied. Barring one, all 31 critical care beds at the state’s nodal hospital for Covid care — Infectious Diseases and Beliaghata General (ID&BG) Hospital — have been taken up. As on Friday, 135 patients are admitted, of which 50% were either critical or semi-critical. The hospital is now getting around 30 patients a day on an average. Along with the critical care beds, all beds with oxygen support remained occupied on Friday. “Efforts are on to make 25 general beds with oxygen support operational by Saturday. We are also planning to open another 25 HDU beds within the next three days so that we can tend to the maximum number of severe patients,” said pulmonologist Kausik Chaudhuri, nodal officer for Covid care at ID&BG. Belle Vue Clinic on Friday added 13 more beds to its existing pool of 93 beds. All the 20 critical care beds in the hospital are occupied. None of the three units of AMRI Hospitals had any vacant Covid bed on Friday. The hospital is ramping up its CCU beds. “All CCU beds are occupied. We will gradually increase the number of beds as and when possible,” said Belle Vue Clinic CEO Pradip Tondon. “The pressure for Covid beds is mounting. We are managing somehow but if the surge continues, it is going to be tough,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. Unlike last year, when the flow of non-Covid patients was insignificant, most hospitals already have nearly full occupancy of these patients this time. “All the 72 ICU beds in our unit is occupied while the 75 general beds too are filling up fast. And our non-Covid section also has 100% occupancy,” said Alok Roy, chairman of the Medica Group of Hospitals. Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences has already pulled up its Covid bed strength from 40 to 68 along with five isolation beds. “We have already jacked up our ICU beds from 16 to 25. We currently have 50 positive patients, including 17 in the ICU,” said R Venkatesh, zonal director (east) of Narayana Health. Hospitals on the eastern fringes — like Charnock Hospital — had all 44 ICU beds taken up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hosps-stare-at-cov-bed-shortage-as-second-wave-sweeps-state/articleshow/81994665.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

However, there were also reports of farmers refusing to sell the produce without involving their arhtiyas. Haryana Arhtiyas’ Association chairman Rajnish Choudhary said Gupta visited Karnal to hold a meeting with arhtiyas who are supporting the procurement process to request them to join the strike against the DBT. “The strike will continue till the government doesn’t agree to the system of optional payment,” he said.

---||Jaipur||Kirori Lal Meena continues protest in Jaipur as BJP leaders join him||JAIPUR: BJP Rajya Sabha MP Kirori Lal Meena continued to stage sit-in with the body of a priest at the Civil Lines on the second day on Friday. Earlier, from April 3 till April 7, Meena had been protesting with the body in Dausa. The city BJP unit has extended its support to Meena and the party’s leaders have started calling it a ‘BJP protest’ against the deteriorating law and order situation in the state. A battery of leaders including the former BJP state president Arun Chaturvedi, Jaipur MP Ramcharan Bohra, Sanganer MLA Ashok Lahoty, Jaipur Greater mayor Somya Gujjar and state BJP vice-president Mukesh Dhadich joined the protest indicating it to be making a big show in the coming days. The priest, Shambhu Sharma, died of heart attack late in the night on April 2, following encroachment of his temple land by the land mafia in Mahua near Dausa. Meena is demanding that the land should be made encroachment free and those involved in the grabbing should be booked for the death of the priest. Meena was protesting with the body since April 3 in Dausa but reached Jaipur, while dodging the police, on Thursday following directions from BJP state president Satish Poonia. “The government has again proved that they are insensitive towards the common man. They are yet to blink their eye on the issue, which shows that they are least concerned for law and order,” said Chaturvedi, who threatened that if the issue is not resolved, the entire BJP will join the protest and take the fight to district and block level. Meena reiterated the demand that until the houses on the temple land at Teekri Jafra village are demolished, talks with the government cannot take place. The Vipr Foundation and Vishwa Hindu Parishad members have also joined the dharna. They called the government ‘anti-Hindu’ for several incidents in the state against temple priests. Considering the building momentum around the protest, police beefed up security in the area to avoid any untoward incident and keeping a sharp vigil on the protesters. The local administration held one round of talks with Meena, but he refused to call off the protest until his demands are met. Meena, in his usual style of resting on a charpai in the middle of the road, can be seen having food with his supporters. He is giving full attention to those coming to see him or expressing solidarity with him. Dausa SP Anil Beniwal suspended SHO Mahua Naresh Sharma for his failure to anticipate the movement of Meena with the body from Dausa to Jaipur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/meena-continues-protest-as-bjp-leaders-join-him/articleshow/81995521.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Covid panic: Parents call up schools over offline boards||Kolkata: The written board examinations beginning May 4 amidst rising cases of Covid have put school heads in a spot. Parents of examinees have now started calling principals to inquire if the board examinations for classes X and XII are set to be pushed back due to the second wave of infections. Many parents have expressed reluctance with sending their children to examination centres during this alarming health situation. Most guardians said they were hoping the three major boards — CBSE, CISCE and the state board — will defer the examinations. “There is a possibility of the Council sending fresh instructions regarding the boards. We should know if there will be any change within 10 days. The exams for classes X and XII are scheduled to begin from May 4 and will continue for a month. The parents are panicking since there is a significant spurt in the number of infections, which is a cause for concern as more young people are being infected,” said St Augustine’s School, Ripon Street, principal Richard Gasper. What’s bothering many parents is the presence of grandparents at home and their vulnerability in case the kids return from the examination centre with the virus. “If the number of cases keep increasing, parents will be wary. Given the massive spurt in Covid cases in Maharashtra, the Council will have to take a call. The decision will be uniform for candidates across the country,” Gasper said. Some schools have received queries from parents about whether the boards will be conducted online. “A few parents visited the campus and asked if there was a possibility of holding the tests on the virtual platform. The possibility has come up because, throughout the year, students have attended classes online, unlike the 2020 board exams that had to be suspended since the infrastructure was not in place back then,” said Julien Day School, Ganganagar, principal Bobby Baxter. A parent of a Class XII science student said the Maharashtra government has considered postponing the tests for candidates taking the state board exams. “The question papers by the Council arrive at the schools at least 10 days before the tests. We are waiting for the intimation from CISCE about the delivery of the question papers,” Baxter said. Another school head said if a candidate or invigilator is detected with Covid on school premises during the board examinations, the remaining papers at that centre would have to be suspended and all those the present, including students, would have to be quarantined. “Looking at the spurt in cases, can the examination conducting bodies take chances?” he asked. “Some of the states are gradually instructing schools to close campuses, like in Delhi. We are waiting for the Council for a final communication about the board examinations, which are only 24 days away,” said the principal of St James’ School, T H Ireland. Fr Bikash Mondal, the principal of Don Bosco School, said he is trying to wrap up the practicals by April 12. CBSE has assured students and parents that all safety measures are being put in place. The staff is being sensitized and told to maintain social distancing at examination centres. Krishna Damani, spokesperson of South Point School, said similar queries have arrived from parents and guardians of board examinees. “The decision will be taken by CBSE and it won’t be a localized one. Hence, we are waiting for further instructions,” Damani said. CISCE and CBSE schools are currently completing the boards practicals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covid-panic-parents-call-up-schools-over-offline-boards/articleshow/81994694.cms||Somdatta Basu

The private companies have also resumed the 50% attendance module and will be maintained till the end of the month. Thereafter, the situation will be reviewed and the next working regime will be decided, said a senior government official. “No centralised notification was issued in this regard.

A similar order was passed on to the Jalpaiguri and Andaman Circuit bench of the high court. Several departments have issued advisories to employees on getting tested if anyone manifests any symptoms. “Our employees have been advised to work from home as much as possible and to maintain safe distance if reporting to work, keeping their masks on all the time. Employees above the age of 55 or those with co-morbidities are advised to work only from home. Entry of visitors, use of public transport and outstation travel are prohibited.

The tiger had a minor injury around its neck. The nylon wire was removed and it was found to be fit to be released into the wild on Friday. Heaving a sigh of relief that the tiger, who goes by the name, “Thunder”, was safe, deputy director, DTR, Manoj Sonkar told TOI, “Our team managed to locate it on Thursday morning, aimed a dart at it but missed. It moved towards the grassland and vanished. A search operation was launched using a dog squad and drone camera. Four hours later, the tiger was located at a water hole nearly 900 metres from the earlier spot. Immediately the rescue team rushed there on an elephant and managed to tranquilize it.” The tiger was captured in Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary, near Chalcua village, Field director Sanjay Pathak said, “The wound on the tiger’s neck was superficial on which an ointment was applied. It was also administered antibiotics and other medicines. The tiger was found fit and released on Friday morning. We will continue to track its movement for the next one month to ensure its wounds are healed. The operation was successful mainly because of continuous efforts of our staff and support from World Wide Fund for Nature-India and National Tiger Conservation Authority.” According to forest department sources, the camera traps were installed in Kataiya after a poacher who was arrested on December 17 had revealed that he was setting a trap for a wild boar but some other animal that got trapped had managed to break free. To their surprise, the foresters found a tiger with a nylon wire entangled around its neck. The matter was worrying as a tigress had starved to death in August, 2020 in Mailani range after it was unable to shake off a plastic wire of a snare that got entangled around its neck, preventing it from eating. A campaign, ‘Save Thunder’, was launched on social media by wildlife activists in January to speed up and support its rescue. Several celebrities had backed the campaign.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/over-100-days-on-dtr-foresters-rescue-tiger-with-nylon-wire-around-its-neck/articleshow/81993940.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Covid claims mom’s life, but not her motherhood||NAGPUR: Amid the daily rollcall of tragedies due to Covid, a particularly wrenching one came to fore on Thursday. A woman in her thirties, who was 32-weeks pregnant, died after fighting Covid-19 for three weeks. However, the doctors did not let her motherhood die. They performed a perimortem caesarean section and delivered a premature baby boy moments before she breathed her last. “This woman from Nagpur who used to work in Mumbai. She got admitted in a critical condition of Covid-19 in our hospital on April 7. Here, she suffered cardiac arrest and was put on ventilator. As per protocol, we decided to perform perimortem caesarean section as a last attempt to save her,” said Dr Payal Agrawal, obstetrician, at Kingsway Hospital, Nagpur. This type of C-Section is performed during imminent cardiac arrest or active cardiac arrest with the ultimate goal to resuscitate the mother and improve fetal survivability. “As it was not possible to move the patient to the operation theatre, we decided to perform a bedside C-Section. It was done in a superfast manner on ICU bed, where the woman was,” Dr Agrawal said. Dr Sushil Lohiya, laparoscopic and bariatric surgeon, assisted her. Dr Deepak Goel, senior paediatric surgeon along with Dr Manish Sonkusare, cardiac anaesthetist resuscitated the newborn with able support of paramedical and nursing staff. Dr Virendra Belekar was the critical care consultant handling the patient. He informed that the patient’s condition was serious right from the day she was diagnosed with Covid-19. “As per her reports, Covid-19 infection was detected sometime in Mid-March when she reached Nagpur at her maternal home for her first delivery. She was admitted to a private hospital where she was treated symptomatically until April 7. Her CT value was serious right from Day 1. When shifted to our hospital, she was critical,” he said. Doctors told TOI that pregnant women needed to take special care during the second wave of the Covid-19. All members in the family must wear masks at home also and the expecting mother must stay in a protected environment. Pregnancy itself is a vulnerable condition to viral infections and would-be mothers are at greater risk, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-claims-moms-life-but-not-her-motherhood/articleshow/81995531.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The crime occurred when the girl was alone at her home, which falls under the Sadar Kotwali limits in Sambhal . The girl told the police that she was also threatened by the accused if she informed anyone of the crime. But the threats failed as she lodged a complaint and soon after an FIR was filed under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Pocso Act. According to Sambhal police, the incident happened on April 1, but it was reported only on Thursday by the family. Police said the accused, who has been identified as Hashim (21), is on the run. “The family reached out to the police only on Thursday. The family has alleged that Hashim had barged into their house when their daughter was alone and raped her. The girl has been sent for a medical examination,” DSP (CO Sambhal), Arun Kumar Singh said. “Police teams have been formed and raids are being conducted to arrest the accused,” he added. SHO of Sadar Kotwali, Vikas Saxena told TOI that an FIR has been registered under sections 376 (punishment for rape), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation), 120 (concealing design to commit offence punishable with imprisonment) of the IPC and under the Pocso (prevention of children from sexual offenses) Act.

---||Hyderabad||Conduct board exams online, suggest teachers & parents||Hyderabad: With the state/boards not giving any clarity about examinations, students, parents and teachers said that children should be allowed to give board exams from their homes or respective schools/colleges. They said that schools/ intermediate colleges should be reopened at least 15 days before the examination so that students can do their last-minute preparation. “I feel the state should not postpone or pass all students. Instead, they can conduct online exams. I will be much safer appearing for exams from home or school and can perform better without worrying about contracting coronavirus,” said H Vinay, a class 10 student. He said that although the syllabus is not completed, he is trying to prepare for exams by watching video lessons. Students and their parents questioned why the exams cannot be conducted in the online mode when they have appeared for the classes virtually for the entire year. “The entire syllabus, including practicals were conducted in online mode this year. When the students are expected to adapt, why are the state or respective boards not thinking about conducting exams in online mode instead of asking students to risk their lives by appearing for exams at an exam center,” said S Krishna, a parent. Teachers said that it shouldn’t be very difficult for SSC, CBSE or other boards to conduct exams in online mode. “They already have experience of conducting computer-based competitive exams. They can tweak a little and if required, they can conduct the entire paper as multiple-choice questions. Doing so would be much better than passing all students without examinations,” said Bhavani G, a biology teacher. They said that the government should make a decision before it is too late and confirm whether or not exams are going to be conducted this year. Any changes in the examination pattern should also be announced beforehand, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/conduct-board-exams-online-suggest-teachers-parents/articleshow/81995542.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Meerut||Blast at cracker godown: earning member gone, kin of 4 dead stare at bleak future, seek compensation||BIJNOR: The family members of five workers, killed in a blast in firecracker godown in Bijnor, on Friday kept their bodies on roads and held protests demanding compensation from the government as they stared at a bleak future due to the loss of an earning member. A massive explosion and subsequent fire claimed five lives in a firecracker godown in Bijnor’s Bakshiwala village on Thursday afternoon. Four other were injured and taken to hospital. On Friday morning, as the dust settled, the mourning gave way to fear of an uncertain future. Those killed in the blast were earning members of their families with no insurance. And with no assurance of any compensation, the families held protests. Soon after the bodies were handed over after post-mortem, they were kept on the roads and protests were held. On Bijnor’s Vidurkuti road, the family of Kumar Shanu also blocked the road traffic on Friday morning. They were demanding strict action against the owner of firecracker godown and adequate compensation. The protesters said that all the deceased were poor and only earning sources for their families. Soon, Bijnor city’s sub divisional magistrate (SDM) Vikramaditya Singh, circle officer Kuldeep Gupta and MLA Suchi Chaudhary reached the spot. The officials assured that they will take the matter with higher authorities and with the government. The blockade was lifted after the assurance. Similar protests and dharna were witnessed in the villages of three other deceased. The manager of the godown has already been arrested. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had taken note of the incident and had directed Bijnor’s district magistrate (DM) Ramakant Pandey and other senior officials to probe the matter and extend help to the aggrieved families. “However, so far, there is no word on the compensation to the families from the administration or the government,” a relative said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/blast-at-cracker-godown-earning-member-gone-kin-of-4-dead-stare-at-bleak-future-seek-compensation/articleshow/81993956.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Meerut||Meerut: Three elderly women walk in for Covid vaccine, get anti-rabies shots instead||MEERUT: Between 9am and 5pm every day, the community health centre at Kandhla town in Shamli runs the Covid-19 vaccination drive. On Mondays and Thursdays, it also organises anti-rabies vaccination camps. This Thursday, three elderly women walked in along with hundreds of others to get their Covid-19 shots. They walked out with anti-rabies shots instead. Saroj Devi, 70, Anarkali, 72, and Satyavati, 62, had arrived separately but grouped together at the health centre. “The first floor of the centre is where Covid-19 vaccinations were being administered. The queue on the ground floor was for anti-rabies vaccination,” Shamli chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Agarwal said. “Instead of going to the first floor, they joined the queue on the ground floor.” It appears no questions were asked of them as they quietly, unknowingly, took the wrong vaccine and left. But before Saroj Devi could reach home, she got sick. She was taken to a private medical practitioner who saw her vaccination certificate — it said she had been inoculated against rabies. The two other women, fortunately, are doing fine. The women had either not read the vaccination certificates or not been able to decipher them. “An inquiry into what went wrong is complete and the report has arrived. All three women are fine now and the pharmacist (who was at the centre), Naresh Sharma, has been suspended for dereliction of duty. The medical superintendent of the community health centre has been issued a warning,” Shamli district magistrate Jasjeet Kaur said. Several things seem to have gone wrong. “There should have been proper signboards to avoid confusion. There was none,” Saroj Devi’s son Manish Verma said. “My mother got off the rickshaw and walked into the OPD.” At the OPD, a card is allotted to every person taking an anti-rabies vaccine shot. “Because the three women did not know otherwise, they got the OPD card, which they didn’t need in any case,” said CMO Agarwal. Next, the mandated exchange between someone administering a vaccine and someone taking it was skipped. “The pharmacist did not even check for a dog bite,” said Manish. Agarwal conceded there was a lapse: “It was a mistake on the part of the pharmacist who administered the anti-rabies vaccine without checking for a dog bite wound, which is mandatory.” DM Kaur said the pharmacist had not checked for a prescription either — it would have been attached to the OPD card had the women needed anti-rabies vaccines. Manish added, “This was gross negligence. We would not even have known had my mother not complained of symptoms which we now know were side effects of the anti-rabies vaccine.” Meerut-based senior physician Dr Harish Mohan Rastogi said these side effects are rare: “Some patients do experience dizziness, headaches, muscle pain or neuropsychiatric reactions after the anti-rabies vaccine, but it’s rare.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/3-elderly-women-walk-in-for-covid-vaccine-get-anti-rabies-shots-instead/articleshow/81993952.cms||Sandeep Rai

In a letter to the PM after a video conference with him on Thursday, Gehlot said the state has administered 86,89,770 doses from January 16 to April 7. “The present stock of vaccine in Rajasthan will finish in next two days. Therefore, it is requested that at least another 30 lakh doses of vaccine be provided to us immediately so that the momentum that we have built up can be maintained and maximum eligible beneficiaries can be vaccinated at the earliest,” he said. Gehlot wrote, “In today’s video conference you have proposed “Tika Utsav” from April 11-14 and aim for 100% vaccination of who are 45 years and above. I appreciate and assure you that Rajasthan will aim for maximum vaccination of people of this age group. We have already planned to increase the pace of vaccination to 5 lakh beneficiaries per day through collaborative approach and effective mobilisation of resources,” said Gehlot. “I want to assure you that we will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to control Covid-19,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/vaccine-stock-to-last-2-days-give-30l-doses-gehlot-to-pm/articleshow/81995538.cms||---
---||India||BASIC nations oppose EU’s plan to impose a ‘carbon border tax’||NEW DELHI: At a time when the European Union is toying with the idea of ‘carbon border tax’ as part of its green push, the BASIC nations — Brazil, South Africa, India and China — have jointly opposed the move, saying such trade barrier would not only be discriminatory but also against the principles of equity under the Paris Agreement on climate change. The BASIC nations expressed concerns over the issue while discussing climate actions during the two-day ministerial meeting which concluded on Thursday. India was the host of the 30th BASIC ministerial meeting, chaired by environment minister Prakash Javadekar. “Ministers expressed concerns regarding the proposal for introducing trade barriers, such as unilateral carbon border adjustment, that are discriminatory and against the principles of equity and CBDR-RC (common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities),” said the joint statement of the BASIC nations. The EU is mulling a ‘carbon border tax’ (carbon border adjustment) on imports in order to force emerging economies to adopt cleaner (non-fossil fuel-based) practices to manufacture goods. Several reports suggest that the Union, representing 27 nations, would come out with its formal proposal in June with a clear roadmap to discuss the issue ahead of the 26th session of the UN climate conference (COP26) to be held in Glasgow (UK) in November. The Group’s joint stand against the proposed carbon trade tax assumes significance ahead of the upcoming leaders’ summit on climate on April 22-23 where 40 world leaders, including from EU nations, UK, India, China and Australia, may express their views on such trade barriers. The US, host of the summit, is expected to clear its stand on the issue at the forum. It is believed by policy-makers in emerging economies that the ‘carbon border adjustment’ concept is being discussed in the garb of pushing developing countries to ‘net-zero’ (emission minus removal of carbon amounts to zero) goals on the basis of untested and expensive technologies for carbon removal. Besides the controversial issue of carbon trade tax, the BASIC nations also raised the issue of climate finance noting that “finance is the key enabler of enhanced ambitions and climate action, particularly at a time when developing countries are facing multiple developmental challenges and the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic”. The meeting also expressed concern over the rich nations’ failure to fulfil their pre-2020 promises under the Kyoto Protocol whose Doha amendment, incidentally, entered into force just a day before it was due to expire. “Commitments made by developed countries in the pre-2020 period must be honoured even as we have moved into the post-2020 era. The substantial gaps in mitigation, adaptation and support provided by developed countries to developing countries in the pre-2020 period must be counterbalanced by ambitious climate change action by developed countries in the post-2020 period,” said the joint statement. The ministers also urged rich nations to revisit their targets on mitigation under the UN Convention (UNFCCC) and Kyoto Protocol, and fulfil their commitments of providing support to developing countries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/basic-nations-oppose-eus-plan-to-impose-a-carbon-border-tax/articleshow/81998314.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||Delhi||Delhi: Super specialty hospital again Covid facility, other operations shut||NEW DELHI: Delhi government-run Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital (RGSSH) has been again converted into a dedicated Covid-19 facility amid a massive surge in coronavirus cases in the national capital, officials said on Friday. All non-Covid services have been suspended till further orders, they said. RGSSH is a 650-bed facility in east Delhi and had played a critical role in combating the pandemic in the city last year, when the national capital had witnessed its three waves of the virus, the last one being in November. “We have suspended all non-Covid services as the hospital is now a dedicated Covid facility. The decision was taken late on Wednesday seeing the massive surge in cases. As of now, 200 patients are admitted,” medical director, RGSSH, Dr B L Sherwal said. He said all the 200 patients have mild to severe symptoms and the same treatment protocol was being followed as was done last year. “This surge is massive and people really need to be careful and follow all Covid safety measures. We had zero patients on March 5, and now 200. That too in the last few weeks. Most of the patients are elderly,” Sherwal said. The younger population is also getting affected but many of them are in home isolation. Sherwal added that a nurse and police personnel, who were on vaccination duty at the hospital, have tested positive and are under home isolation. The 650-bed RGSSH was declared a coronavirus facility when the pandemic began last year and in early January was converted into a partially operating Covid-19 hospital. Recently, Delhi government had issued an order to reserve 500 beds at this facility for Covid-19 patients. AIIMS has also decided to restrict elective surgeries in response to the heightened need for diversion of infrastructure, manpower and material response for prevention and control of Covid-19 outbreak. In private hospitals also, doctors said, planned surgeries are being put on hold to accommodate more Covid-19 patients.

---||Nagpur||Row over mild patients in hosps, moderate to critical sent out of district||Nagpur: Even as citizens find it extremely difficult to get beds for moderate to critically-ill Covid patients, authorities have observed several mild cases occupying beds at many private hospitals beds, mainly out of fear or precaution. On Saturday, the district administration was compelled to move some serious patients outside the city. In a video clip, district collector Ravindra Thakare said 12 Covid patients were shifted to Amravati Super Speciality hospital as some beds would be made available for Nagpur patients there. On April 9, TOI had reported that fed up citizens were already moving out of the city in search of beds. Officials said the issue of ineligible patients was raised during a meeting of all stakeholders regarding the ongoing bed crisis by divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar on Friday. Kumar didn’t respond to TOI’s calls. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI that the committee led by a deputy municipal commissioner and comprising doctors from medical colleges is randomly visiting private hospitals to check if any ineligible patient is occupying Covid bed. “The committee is empowered to instruct the hospital to move out mild cases to a DCHC, CCC or home isolation. If the hospital doesn’t act, I will take action,” he said. Asked about augmenting city’s health facilities, the civic chief said, “We are continuously adding beds for Covid patients. We are trying our best.” Many patients with CT scan score of more than 10, considered as moderate patients who can turn severe or critical, were not able to get admission while several patients with CT scan of even 5 were occupying beds. Vidarbha Hospital Association (VHA), which was also part of the meeting, refuted the allegations, officials said. VHA president Dr Ashok Arbat said admission is based on clinical condition. “Each of us is receiving numerous calls for admissions in Covid wards. Why would we keep mild patients in such a situation?” he said. Dr Arbat said multiple parameters of each patient like CT scan score, temperature and other conditions are taken into account before recommending admission. “We told the administration that all these are technical aspects and must be left to experts. The rule is all serious cases are admitted in hospital,” he said. Officials said though it depends on the judgement of a doctor, it can’t be ruled out that mild cases are being admitted due to various reasons, including pressure from politicians and VIPs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/row-over-mild-patients-in-hosps-moderate-to-critical-sent-out-of-district/articleshow/81995543.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: People pour in for vax despite stockout notices, cops called||Mumbai: The vaccine shortage meant Mumbai could vaccinate only 33,551 on Friday, down from its daily average of 53,000 vaccinations since April 1 (see box). The city had started Friday’s drive with less than enough doses, and the crisis began to unfold by noon as some of the major public vaccination facilities started running out. The largest centre at the BKC jumbo facility shut its gates after it exhausted the last of its 160 doses around 11.30am. Since news of vaccine shortage was relayed a couple of days ago, crowds had been rushing to centre in panic. People continued to pour in despite notices about the stockout, and the cops had to be called in. By afternoon, the access road to the centre was barricaded. At the Nesco jumbo facility in Goregaon, the main gates had to be shut around 2 pm. Minor scuffles broke out near the gate as people still wanted to enter the premises. Similar scenes played out at VN Desai Hospital in Santacruz, where less than 300 could be vaccinated. The hospital’s cramped campus was filled with hundreds more, who had to leave disappointed. SevenHills Hospital in Marol, which vaccinates up to 3,500 in a day, had put up banners announcing the stockout. State officials said despite the crunch, Maharashtra continued to be ahead of other states having administered over 97 lakh doses on Friday. It managed to vaccinate a little over 3 lakh people on Friday, a drop from the daily average of 4.27 lakh vaccinations the state had been clocking since April 3. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said people needn’t worry as they will be vaccinated once stocks arrive. “There is no need to panic as doses will come shortly. People waiting for a second dose of Covishield can anyway take it between 6-8 weeks,” he said. Private vaccination centres have been shut for the weekend, but will resume normal operations next week as more vaccines arrive. Four workers from the BMC’s solid waste management who came to the BKC centre for their second dose said they were surprised to see no vaccines for frontliners. Laxman Bhide had brought his 80-year-old mother hoping to get her vaccinated. “I should have got her earlier. Who knew the stocks would run out?” said the Kurla resident. Reports of stockouts came from MMR too. After Vasai-Virar, Mira Bhayander officials said till Friday, they have almost exhausted their stock of 1.02 lakh vaccines. Vaccination at three private hospitals in Kalyan-Dombivli was closed due to the shortage. The remaining 19 centres have doses for only the next two days. The three centres which are closed include AIMS hospital (Dombivli), Mamta Hospital (Dombivli) and Siddhivinayak hospital (Kalyan).

---||Chandigarh||‘Govt is now breaking up mandis’||Kurukshetra: Bharatiya Kisan Union (Charuni) state president Gurnam Singh Charuni on Friday said the government had started the process “to break the mandi system by imposing the direct benefit transfer (DBT)” scheme. Charuni on Friday released different videos in which he said the government had moved ahead to break mandis and it had been made compulsory this time that the payment of every farmer would be released directly to his account only. “This should be voluntary for farmers: to select how he wants to receive the payment, whether through arhtiya (commission agent) or directly. Farmers have old ties with arhtiyas. In case of an emergency, they take money from the arhtiya. Because the situation of the farmer is so fragile, he does not have any savings. Farmers do have debt and they do not get loans from anywhere else. Only arhtiyas help farmers in emergency,” said Charuni. He said the government was going to break mandis and this was creating a rift between arhtiyas and kisans. “Step by step, it is moving forward to close mandis and an example of the same is Pundri grain market, which has been locked as the entire crop would be sent to the godown of Adani,” said Charuni. FIRs won’t stop protests: Charuni to Haryana govt Talking about cases being registered against protesters at different places in Haryana, Charuni said, “We want to give a warning to the government: it should refrain from lodging such cases as it will not break the andolan (movement). The government should tell us when and where to fill the jails, we are ready to fill their jails and bear their cases. But we will not turn back from our motive and will not let our andolan fall back. We are ready to get arrested. I request all workers to strengthen the protest, maintain peace and refrain from violence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/govt-is-now-breaking-up-mandis/articleshow/81995544.cms||---

This comes a day after the deputy collector, Bardez, rejected Carvalho's application for issuance of caste certificate. It may be recalled that Congress functionary Sudhir Kandolkar along with Arolkar, a candidate for Mapusa municipal elections from the Mapuxekaracho Ekvott panel, had alleged that North Goa BJP vice-president Franky Carvalho had fraudulently obtained a caste certificate from the secretary of the Traditional Fishermen’s Association of North Goa Peter Menon citing that he belongs to the Christian fishing community (Christian kharvi), only to contest in ward 7 which is reserved for OBC in the new notification. Carvalho had, however, refuted the allegations and had clarified that he followed the legal and correct procedure to obtain the certificate. He had castigated Arolkar, claiming that he obtained a caste certificate by mentioning his birth was registered in Raia. Carvalho had filed his nomination from ward 7 on Thursday and Arolkar had filed his papers on the previous day from the same ward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-mapusa-caste-certificates-create-confusion/articleshow/81996487.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

We are now assisting in Covid-19 vaccination work where a lot of paperwork is to be handled by us only. But look at the compensation that we are getting, compared to others at the same vaccination centre. It’s inhuman and the government must not give any more excuses,” said Meshram. Ranjana Paunikar, secretary of the union, said last year many things were promised to Asha workers, but nothing materialized. “We were roped in under the Corona Yoddha initiative last year and the municipal corporation promised us Rs200 per day for this. That amount was never given to us,” said Paunikar. She claimed that around September last year, the remuneration was revised to Rs1,000 per month. “We got paid for just three months under this revised rate and then it stopped. It seems our contribution is not being acknowledged by the government,” said Paunikar. She added that all Asha workers are putting in anywhere between 10 and 12 hours per day on the job. “Those in the night shift are going home around 10pm, but we do our job diligently. Our union president Rajendra Sathe has warned of an agitation if the demands are not met soon,” said Paunikar. While Sathe could not be reached over the phone, a written statement issued by him mentioned that the minimum wage rule should be applied to all union members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-warrior-asha-workers-seek-wage-hike/articleshow/81995549.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Locals called a meeting after JJP Barwala MLA Jogi Ram Sihag visited some villages in his segment on Tuesday. For the meeting, organised at a chaupal in Dabra, locals also summoned some persons who reported to have invited the MLA for a visit to the village. A villager who was present in the meeting said one of these persons distanced himself from MLA’s meeting. Earlier, the MLA gad shared some pictures of his visit to Dabra and other villages on his Facebook account. Kanwal Singh, a villager, informed that some persons were asked to explain why they have invited the MLA. “They denied sending any invitation to the MLA. We have warned them and they have agreed to abide by the panchayat’s decision to not allow ruling parties’ MLAs in the village,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rs-5-1k-fine-for-invitations-to-bjp-jjp-mlas-hisar-village/articleshow/81995550.cms||---
---||Ranchi||SDO’s nod mandatory before organising marriages in JSR||Jamshedpur: Steel City residents now have to seek Dhalbhum SDO’s approval before organising a marriage ceremony, officials said on Friday. Earlier this week, the state government had passed an order which allowed a maximum of 200 attendees at weddings and the SDO’s office will see to it that the rule is complied with. Sources said the organisers have to inform the SDO’s office in advance about the exact number of attendees and the location of the venue. The organisers need to make sure that the guests wear masks and follow social distancing. The district officials will reportedly conduct surprise checks of the venue and penalise the organiser and the owner of the premises if anyone is found violating the safety norms. Needless to say, the rule elicited mixed response from the people. Jyoti Roy’s son was planning to tie the knot soon and she had planned an elaborate ceremony with the guest list exceeding 750. But now she has to bring down the number of guests. “It is not easy to do such a thing since so many of my friends and relatives will feel left out,” she said. Manju Sinha, whose daughter will get married at the end of this month, said she will follow the rules to the hilt as people’s lives are more important than a function. Apart from marriages, banquet halls cannot organise other gatherings like birthday parties and anyone found doing so will be penalised under the Epidemic Diseases Act. Meanwhile, SDO Nitish Kumar Singh, along with other officials, oversaw the arrangements made at the newly set up Covid camp hospital in Professional College. Civic body officials also paid a visit to the hospital to make sure that it can cater to an emergency-like situation in case all the hospitals end up being occupied. Last year, the administration had made similar arrangements when the cases recorded a surge. Later, many of those camps were closed when the number of cases went down. On Friday, several police teams were spotted inspecting the market places to ensure that shopkeepers do not violate the safety protocols. Those not wearing masks were let off with a warning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/sdos-nod-mandatory-before-organising-marriages-in-jsr/articleshow/81994851.cms||Debasish Chatterjee

Of them, 30 have been disbanded and pressed into service as coaches of passenger or express trains,” Ranchi divisional railway manager Neeraj Ambasth told TOI. Ambasth added, “We have not received any communiqué from the state health department seeking services of isolation coaches. If there is a requirement, we can re-equip the coaches with the paraphernalia within 48 hours and press them into service.” Later in the afternoon, TOI was denied permission into the Hatia coaching yard of the division to take photographs of the existing isolation coaches. In all, Ranchi, Chakradhapur and Dhanbad divisions of South Eastern Railways and East Central Railways readied 130 isolation coaches in April last year. SER’s Chakradharpur division had set up 30 coaches while Dhanbad had built 40. Equipped with oxygen supplies, the coaches were designed to have a dedicated sitting area for medical staff. Each coach incurred a refurbishing cost between Rs 5-10 lakh. The coaches were built to ease off the load on hospitals and provide on board treatment to mildly symptomatic patients in the city and rural areas. State health minister Banna Gupta had termed the exercise of the railways an eyewash. “This initiative is nothing but an eyewash by the Centre just like beating utensils and lighting candles,” Gupta had earlier said. When contacted, senior health officials did not respond on the matter. “The decision to use isolation coaches made by the railways will be taken by the political dispensation of the state,” a senior official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/50-isolation-train-coaches-dismantled-after-lying-unused/articleshow/81994506.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||BAU medic bags patent for herbal pill for fever, body ache||Ranchi: A scientist from Birsa Agriculture University (BAU), identified as Dr Kaushal Kumar, was granted patent by the Indian Patent Office, Kolkata for his herbal medicine, BAU Birsin, which can be used for treating cough and cold, body ache and fever. With this, the medicine will be produced commercially and talks in this regard are already underway with the National Biodiversity Authority in Chennai. According to university officials, Kumar is the first person from BAU to achieve such a thing and the vice-chancellor, Dr Onkar Nath Singh, met him on Friday to congratulate him. Kumar presently heads the department of forest products and utilization at BAU. Before joining BAU, he worked as a senior scientist and headed the herbal section at Patanjali Yogpeeth in Haridwar. Kumar said the medicine’s formulation has been prepared with the leaves and bark of a tree named Vitex peduncularis (commonly known as Charigorwa), which is found in abundance in the rural areas of tribal and hilly regions of Jharkhand and other states. He added, “I decided to work on the plant after conducting an extensive field survey and drawing inferences from my experience. Even though there is a large reserve of herbal plants in Jharkhand they cannot be accessed easily. One has to search for them in the forests.” The medicine is a synergistic composition, which comprises a mixture of several natural and herbal ingredients. The product is effective up to two years when stored under the recommended conditions. “All the standard scientific parameters for herbal drug formulation have been followed in preparing the medicine,” Kumar said. “In the absence of antipyretic and analgesic herbal products in the market, the present invention has a great scope,” he said, adding, “Farmers in Jharkhand can grow the plant as a commercial crop if the demand for the medicine increases.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bau-medic-bags-patent-for-herbal-pill-for-fever-body-ache/articleshow/81994777.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Ranchi||Bangladeshi national convicted for faking citizenship 6 yrs ago||Ramgarh: A lower court in Ramgarh on Wednesday convicted a Bangladeshi national of faking Indian citizenship at Kolkata’s Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport six years ago. Sheikh Faridul Islam (30), a native of Faridpur in Dhaka district in Bangladesh, was arrested from Kolkata airport on November 6, 2014 with an Indian passport, a Bangladeshi passport and an Aadhaar Card. In the Indian passport and in the UID card, Islam had faked to be a native of Chitarpur under Rajrappa police station in Jharkhand. Additional public prosecutor S K Shukla said the court of additional district judge Rajani Kant Pathak found Islam guilty of two provisions of the Foreigners Act and three sections of the Indian Penal Code. “The court will pronounce Islam’s quantum of punishment on April 12,” Shukla said. Following his arrest, Islam’s documents were sent to Ramgarh police by Kolkata Police for verification. Upon verification, it was found that Islam’s documents were fake. Lileshwar Mahto, the officer-in-charge of Rajrappa police station, then filed an FIR against Islam. The latter was moved to Ramgarh jail in 2015. Although it is not clear where Islam was headed to from Kolkata airport at the time of his arrest, the cops later found that he had purchased a plot of land and opened an account with a PSU bank in Hazaribag district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bangladeshi-national-convicted-for-faking-citizenship-6-yrs-ago/articleshow/81994442.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Ranchi cannot be compared to Mumbai in population & size, but the covid 2nd wave in the capital is just as bad||In the last few days, telephones have been ringing off the hook at hospitals and pathological laboratories -- both private and government-run -- across Ranchi. Officials at these healthcare centres simply refuse to answer them as they know that they just cannot honour requests for hospital beds or make arrangements for quick or at-home Covid tests anymore. Such has been the surge in the number of coronavirus cases and the demand for Covid tests among people with Covid-like symptoms that healthcare officials in Ranchi have had to tie up with path labs in Patna and Mumbai just to clear the backlog. At sample collection centres across the city, people with cough and fever have stood in tight queues for as much as six hours just for their swaps to be taken. And in some cases, it takes days to get the report, triggering anxiety among those who believe that they have contracted the virus. There is no lockdown or night curfew in the city – only shops have been asked to close at 8pm and there are restriction on the number of people at gatherings and social events – but the crowds on the streets have visibly thinned compared to a couple of months ago. The conversation among locals revolve around the possibility of a new, infectious strain of the virus doing the rounds – positive samples have been sent Bhubaneswar for genome sequencing, but there is no word on the result. The scenes in the tier-2 Ranchi are similar to those in Mumbai, the metropolis that is reporting above 10,000 new Covid cases a day. When looking at absolute numbers, the outbreak in the Jharkhand capital does not seem that bad – it got 850-odd cases on Thursday and has a seven-day rolling average of daily new cases of 600 on Friday, but with a positivity rate hovering around 20%, Ranchi is rapidly emerging as the one of the worst Covid-hit regions anywhere the country. In Mumbai, with a population of over 1.25 crore people, about nine in 10,000 people are testing positive every day. For Ranchi, a densely packed city 10.7 lakh people, the corresponding figure stood at eight on Thursday when it reported 858 new cases, the second highest since the pandemic outbreak started here in March last year. The number of active cases and new cases have broken all records created in the first wave (see graphic) and this is when new infections are rising every day and there is no sign of the spread slowing down. Admitting that the situation now is worse than what it was during the first wave, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP)’s state head Dr Pravin Kumar Karn said, “We have collected positive samples from five laboratories and sent them to the Institute of Life Sciences in Bhubaneswar. We are still waiting for the gene variant to be mapped.” He added, “Going by my experience, it is clear that the present strain, if at all it is a new variant, is more infectious, spreading rapidly and putting a lot of pressure on the healthcare infrastructure available here.” In some relief, the mortality rate per new cases have not rocketed like the new infections and remains pegged at abou 0.7% in the city, compared to 0.88% in Jharkhand. But experts have cautioned that this too might change as hospitals run out of the gear needed to save people in critical condition. Dr Pradeep Bhattacharya, in-charge of the Covid centre at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences, said, “Given how fast the virus is spreading, people might be deprived of medical care.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ranchi-cannot-be-compared-to-mumbai-in-population-size-but-the-covid-2nd-wave-in-the-capital-is-just-as-bad/articleshow/81994843.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||Hemant hits 6-day campaign trail in Madhupur for Hafizul||Dumka/Ranchi: Chief minister Hemant Soren kicked-off his six-day campaign trail in Madhupur on Friday by addressing a public meeting at the Margomunda-based Thana Ground. In his maiden meeting in Madhupur, Hemant began by attacking BJP and seeking people’s support to strengthen the incumbent Mahagathbandhan government of JMM, Congress and the RJD. “BJP believes in the politics of dividing people on religious lines. You all must step forward to end this kind of politics by supporting our candidate Hafizul Hassan,” Hemant said. He is due to address at least six election meetings across different blocks of Madhupur before returning to Ranchi on April 14. Before addressing the gathering, Hemant went into a huddle with JMM’s office bearers, local functionaries and their counterparts from the Congress and RJD behind closed doors to fine tune the campaign strategy. Hemant and his father Shibu are the star campaigners for Hafizul. At Madhupur, JMM is banking on sympathy votes by fielding Hassan, who is the elder son of late JMM stalwart Haji Hussain Ansari, who died due to post-Covid complications last year. Hafizul is pitted against BJP’s Ganga Narayan Singh who joined the saffron brigade from Ajsu Party after a defeat in the 2019 assembly election. Ministers from the Congress and RJD are also campaigning for Hafizul in Madhupur. Meanwhile in Ranchi, a delegation of BJP met state chief electoral officer K Ravikumar and claimed that the Deoghar administration is working in favour of Hafizul. Led by former BJP’s Mandar MLA Gangotri Kujur, the delegation claimed Deoghar’s district’s officials were forcefully removing BJP banners, posters and flags from the entire assembly constituency. The delegation demanded an impartial probe into the conduct of the officials. “After receiving the complaints, the CEO rang up Deoghar SDO and instructed the officer to probe the allegations,” BJP said in a statement after the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hemant-hits-6-day-campaign-trail-in-madhupur-for-hafizul/articleshow/81994399.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The number of active cases in Ranchi reached an all-time high of 4,721 on Thursday night, going past the 4,425 patients the city had on September 4 in the peak of the first wave of the pandemic. The number had fallen to a low of 198 on February 5. On Friday, the active caseload in Ranchi breached the 5,000-mark and settled at 5,217. Even the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases touched 600, going past the 500-mark for the first time since the outbreak started in the state on March 31 last year. The figure was in the 20s throughout February, falling to a low of 21 in the middle of the month. In the first eight days of the month, the state has already added 4,913 fresh cases of the virus and clocked 31 deaths. If the trend continues, April might be the worst month for Jharkhand since the inception of the pandemic here on March 31 last year. Till now, September 2020 was the worst month in terms of fresh cases with 11,294 cases and October 2020 saw the maximum number of deaths at 59. Ranchi deputy commissioner Chhavi Ranjan, who paid a visit to the Khelgaon isolation centre, said, “We are working to convert a part of Khelgaon into a Covid Care Centre and will soon add at least 50 oxygen beds. Adequate number of healthcare workers will be deployed in the next couple of days. We have once again acquired Paras Hospital in Dhurwa area which will be working as a full time CCC and are also in the process of getting Mecon Hospital on board.” Ranjan further said Mecon has a capacity of 60 beds and Paras will earmark 50 beds for Covid patients which will further boost the capacity, which is currently around 1,200 beds. Meanwhile, in order to clear the backlog of samples collected for Covid-19 tests, for which the district health authority was pulled up by the high court, it was decided to send samples to private labs and at the same time, ramp up collection. An MoU has been signed with a private testing lab in this regard, officials said. Incident commanders have been asked to carry out surveys to check the status of beds at private hospitals. This comes after state health minister Banna Gupta asked private hospitals to reserve 25% of the total number of beds for Covid-19 patients. “I have directed all incident commanders to calculate the total bed capacity of each hospital and check whether 25% of that has been reserved for Covid patients. The hospitals are also being told that they have to update the bed availability online as well as on a spreadsheet provided by the administration so that we can monitor the situation,” said Ranchi SDO Sameera S.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/200-bed-makeshift-hosp-to-be-set-up-in-rims-football-ground/articleshow/81994474.cms||Gaurav Pandey

The four hospitals include Ranchi Trust Hospital, Guru Nanak Hospital, Health Point hospital and Alam Hospital and Research Centre. An official statement by the state health department said the hospitals have been asked to clarify their absence in the meeting and explain their apathy and non-cooperation towards health machinery in the fight against pandemic. Gupta on Thursday said the government will not hesitate in taking action against those private healthcare facilities which are unwilling cooperate with the state in its fight against Covid-19. Gupta’s remarks came after representatives of a few private hospitals in Ranchi did not turn up for a high-level meeting held at the Institute of Public Health in Namkum to review the Covid-19 situation in Jharkhand despite the health minister inviting them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/notice-to-4-private-hosps-for-skipping-bannas-meeting/articleshow/81994794.cms||---

---||India||SC: Paying extortion money not terror funding||NEW DELHI: In an important ruling, the Supreme Court on Friday said paying extortion money to terror groups to carry on business activities smoothly could not be termed as funding terror organisations and granted bail to a Jharkhand coal transporter who had paid huge amounts to the Tritiya Prastuti Committee (TPC), a breakaway faction of the CPI (Maoist). A bench of Justices L N Rao and and S Ravindra Bhat granted bail to businessman Sudhesh Kedia, whose coal transport company Esskay Concast and Minerals is engaged in transporting coal on behalf of GVK Power and Godavari Commodities, in a case filed by the NIA accusing him of meeting and paying huge amounts to terror organisation TPC. The NIA, in its 2018 chargesheet against 16 people, had given details of the modus operandi of collecting levy from contractors, traders and transporters. The NIA alleged that Kedia had met TPC leaders and had paid levy to TPC leader Akraman, CCL employees and village committee members from his current account. He was arrested on January 10 last year and his bail pleas were rejected by the trial court and the Jharkhand HC. Kedia's counsel C A Sundaram told the SC that the HC had rejected his bail plea saying since he had admitted to paying extortion money, it amounted to funding the terrorist organisation. After examining the evidence on record, the Justice Rao-led bench said, “We are satisfied that Kedia is entitled for bail and that the special court and the high court erred in not granting bail to him.” "A close scrutiny of the material placed before the court would clearly show that the main accusation against Kedia is that he paid levy/extortion amount to the terrorist organisation. Payment of extortion money does not amount to terror funding. It is clear from the supplementary chargesheet and the other material on record that other accused who are members of the terrorist organisation have been systematically collecting extortion amounts from businessmen in Amrapali and Magadh areas. The appellant is carrying on transport business in the area of operation of the organisation." The SC said paying extortion money and meeting members of a terrorist organisation for that purpose could not implicate a person as a conspirator for raising funds for the unlawful organisation. "Prima facie, we are not satisfied that a case of conspiracy has been made out at this stage only on the ground that Kedia had met members of the organisation," it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-paying-extortion-money-not-terror-funding/articleshow/81998316.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||Histories of regions no less important than chronicles of Delhi-based empires: Modi||NEW DELHI: The histories of regions and states are part of the national narrative and no less important than the chronicles of empires that were based in Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday while speaking on the diverse and comprehensive history of Odisha. Speaking after he released the Hindi translation of ‘Odisha Itihaas’ written by the late Harekrishna Mahtab, the state's prime minister and then first chief minister, Modi said the saga of Odisha and its rich traditions that went back several centuries should reach all people in the country. Also present were Bhartruhari Mahtab, BJD MP and son of the late leader, and oil and natural gas minister Dharmendra Pradhan. The PM said credit for the translation went to the Mahtab Trust and Shankarlal Purohit who did the translation. Mahtab, a six-term MP, recalled that Pradhan had suggested the need to translate the work into Hindi. Pradhan said Modi had brought an intense focus to infrastructure development in Odisha and the state has benefited from it. The PM said the east of India was a rich reserve of talent and resources and had once led India in its intellectual and material quest. "There has to be a balance between east and west and India will never remain backward if the north-east, Bihar, West Bengal and Odisha are developed to their true potential," he said. He referred to Mahtab as an exceptional parliamentarian who had no airs of someone who came from a political family. "When we look at how the progeny of political families are doing, we wonder. But you will not see this in Bhartruhari bhai, it shows the upbringing of the Mahtab household," he said. Modi remembered Harekrishna Mahtab’s contribution in the freedom struggle when he was often in jail and also noted that he had the rare distinction of being in prison again during the Emergency — against the party he represented as CM. The PM said history should not only be a lesson of the past but should also be a mirror to the future. He said in the Indian tradition, history was not limited to kings and palaces but had evolved with people over thousands of years. "This is a foreign thought process that has turned the stories of dynasties and palaces into history," he said. The PM emphasised that with struggles like the Paika Rebellion, Ganjam Revolt and Sambalpur Struggle, Odisha always gave new energy to the fire of revolt against British rule. He noted the contribution of Ramadevi, Malti Devi, Kokila Devi and Rani Bhagyawati. He said thousands of kilometres of national highways and coastal highways were being constructed in Odisha which would lead to improved connectivity. He said there was a need to remember the contributions of tribal leaders and societies and a museum should be planned in Odisha for this purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/histories-of-regions-no-less-important-than-chronicles-of-delhi-based-empires-modi/articleshow/81998324.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Transport staff strike illegal, no talks or pay hike: Karnataka government||BENGALURU: The Karnataka government on Friday turned the heat on striking state road transport corporation employees, declaring their three-day-old strike 'illegal' and slamming the door on negotiations or pay revision as per the 6th Pay Commission "in these times". Chief minister BS Yediyurappa said, "Is your strike justified when people are suffering due to the pandemic? Rejoin duty today." The government called the strike 'illegal' under the Industrial Disputes Act of 1947 and referred the issue to the Industrial Tribunal. This is a precursor to the government acting tough against employees, including invoking the Essential Services Maintenance Act (Esma). The CM ruled out negotiations with the employees. He said the state government has pumped in Rs 2,300 crore towards transport employees' salaries in the pandemic-hit 2020. Govt relied on reportHe said the government is not able to implement the wages as per the 6th Pay Commission now. “When you know we won’t (be able to) do it, why are you expecting it? It’s wrong. As transport employees, it is your duty to serve the people at this point of time. Listening to some unions and some people and going on strike is not right,” the CM added. The government order calling the strike illegal followed a report by the labour commissioner that said calling for strike is illegal while the employees and the employer were still holding talks. According to the report, the employees had given the strike notice on March 18. At a hearing on April 5, the employees were asked not to go on strike till the conciliation process was over. But employees went ahead. The report said BMTC, KSRTC, NEKRTC and NWKSRTC are described as ‘public utility services’ under the Industrial Disputes Act and a strike amounts to violation of the Act. “The government is ready for talks with the employees. If they fail to budge, then we will think of invoking Esma,” a senior labour officer said. Deputy CM Laxman Savadi warned employees against preventing their colleagues from returning to work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/transport-staff-strike-illegal-no-talks-or-pay-hike-karnataka-government/articleshow/81998330.cms||---

Defending one such decision, the MHA informed the HC that the move of the Indian embassy in Brussels, Belgium, asking a Belgian woman to surrender her OCI card after the dissolution of her marriage with an Indian national was taken due to such a policy. The woman has challenged in the HC the provision of the Citizenship Act — Section 7D(f) — under which a foreign spouse of an Indian national would lose OCI status on divorce. MHA said the Section under challenge makes a clear classification as it applies to foreigners who were registered as OCI cardholders on the strength of their spouse being a citizen of India or an OCI cardholder. MHA said the woman was issued a Person of Indian Origin card by the embassy of India, Brussels, on August 21, 2006 on the basis of her marriage with an Indian national. She legally divorced her husband in October 2011, and the PIO card issued to her on the strength of the marriage should have been cancelled, but it was not done at that time. An OCI card was inadvertently issued to her in 2017 even though she was not married to an Indian citizen or an OCI cardholder at that time, and now she has been requested to surrender the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/foreigners-lose-oci-tag-when-divorced-from-indians-mha-tells-hc/articleshow/81998326.cms||---

The state saw a whopping 7,955 Covid cases and 46 deaths, while the number of people admitted to ICUs touched 378. Bengaluru reported 5,576 cases - the highest since the pandemic hit the state. Prior to this, the highest number of Covid positive cases seen in a single day was 5,121 on October 8, 2020. "It is high time the pandemic is taken seriously by all. We need to break the chain of transmission," said health minister K Sudhakar, exhorting people to follow basic health protocols such as wearing masks, sanitizing hands at frequent intervals and avoiding crowded places. Hotels, eateries can’t run beyond 10pm: Top copThe situation is alarming in Bengaluru as the positivity rate (the number of people turning positive per 100 tests) touched 7.22% on Friday. The city reported 29 deaths and, 21 of these were senior citizens. Bengaluru City police commissioner Kamal Pant told TOI: “Hotels, eateries and other commercial establishments interacting with the public cannot run beyond 10pm. Firms, offices, companies operating night shifts can run the show but without appearing in the public. For instance, a software engineer on night shift should make sure he or she reaches the office before 10pm and leaves after 5am the next day. The main objective is to avoid unnecessary movement of citizens.” Asked whether his department will issue pass or coupons as was done during the 2020 lockdown, Pant replied in the negative. According to the order, the curfew will be in force from 10pm and 5am from Saturday to the morning of April 21. The government has prohibited all types of commercial activities, except medical and emergency services, in Bengaluru, Mysuru, Mangaluru, Udupi, Manipal, Bidar, Kalaburagi and Tumakuru. The government order passed by chief secretary P Ravi Kumar restrains the public from moving around during night without valid reasons. “We hope that the restrictions imposed during night will slow the spread of Covid,” a health official added.

Drivers under the banner of Maharashtra App-Based Transport Workers’ Union, Nagpur, resorted to this step after collector Ravindra Thakare, who is also chairman of regional transport authority, ignored their previous six memorandums. The agitating drivers claimed that the two top cab aggregators exploit them and deduct money citing various reasons. “Not just the drivers, these companies are also fleecing passengers by charging different fares at different timings in a day for the same distance,” said the agitators. Speaking to TOI, taxi drivers claimed both the cab aggregators currently charge 30-35% commission per ride. Initially, it used to be zero, then they charged 5 %, which rose to 10 % and now 30-35 %. This has reduced the income and most drivers are facing severe financial crisis and finding it difficult to repay their vehicle loans. The taxi drivers claimed they are paid only Rs6-7 per km, which is less than what autorickshaw drivers earn in the city. The aggregators must increase the base fare, the drivers said and vowed to continue the protests till their demand is met. The app-based taxi drivers also urged the collector to direct financial institutions to relax norms for repayment of loan for at least a year. “Due to the pandemic and Covid-19 restrictions, our business has been hit hard as most citizens nowadays prefer private vehicles,” said one of the drivers Pravin Nadelwar. In the recent past, three app-based taxi drivers have committed suicide in the city and recently another driver ended his life in Bengaluru. Citing these incidents, the drivers stressed that the fare hike must be implemented immediately as several of them are unable to pay the EMIs because of the acute financial crisis caused by the pandemic-induced curbs. Thakare later spoke to transport commissioner Avinash Dakhane over the long-pending issue. Dakhane clarified that the state government is formulating a policy in this regard. After assurance from the collector, the drivers left the collectorate. “If our demands are not met soon, we would intensify our agitation,” warned the drivers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cab-drivers-swarm-dist-collectorate-for-fare-hike/articleshow/81996657.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Most of the reporting was one-sided. When CBI starts its probe, all cabinet members will stand by Deshmukh,” the cabinet member said. Pawar had a brief discussion with senior NCP members, including Praful Patel, newly-appointed home minister Dilip Walse Patil, state NCP chief Jayant Patil and Deshmukh. “Pawar’s concern was serious. He felt that in the battle against a section of senior IPS officers, Deshmukh was fighting it alone,” the member said . He also said the state home department should examine the possibility of holding a departmental probe against ex-Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pawar-felt-ncp-mantris-failed-to-back-deshmukh/articleshow/81998357.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar
---||Nagpur||Remdesivir use in govt hospitals 32%, in pvt ones it’s 107%: FDA||Nagpur: A data shared by Maharashtra Food and Drugs administration (FDA) with the district collectors has pointed out that private hospitals were using Remdesivir injections in much larger quantities than government hospitals “under questionable circumstances”. The letter was sent to the collectors in the backdrop of the statewide crisis and shortage of Remdesivir injections vis-à-vis a spike in the Covid cases and higher number of hospitalizations as compared to last year. As per the FDA letter to collectors, government hospitals in Nagpur district are treating only 32% (490) of their Covid patients on 1,526 beds with Remdesivir as on April 7. In comparison, in private hospitals Remdesivir is being used in 2,598 cases (almost 107%) as against 2,437 Covid patients. “Remdesivir is being used strictly as per the Covid treatment protocol,” said Dr Avinash Gawande, medical superintendent, Government Medical College and Hospital. In most of the districts in Vidarbha, except Akola, Remdesivir usage in private hospitals is more than 100% for Covid patients, as per the letter. In Akola, private hospitals are using Remdesivir for 86% of their patients while government hospitals are treating only 45% of their Covid patients, it stated. The state FDA commissioner Abhimanyu Kale has urged the district collectors across the state to keep a tab on the private hospitals that are seem to be overusing Remdesivir to treat Covid-19 patients in violations of the task force guidelines prepared on the basis of the health department protocol. He has also asked the collectors to initiate action against private hospitals if their Remdesivir use is found to be in contravention of the district-level or state-level Covid task force guidelines. The FDA letter, penned by Kale, has also observed that the government hospitals are cautiously administering Remdesivir injections to Covid patients, especially the ones turning severe from moderate. The letter expressed doubt over the manner in which the private hospitals are treating patients with high usage of Remdesivir. In Amravati district, the government hospitals have been using Remdesivir for only 34% of their patients (80 out of 232 beds) while private ones are using 500 injections to treat their 493 Covid patients. In Yavatmal too, only 32% patients were treated with Remdesivir in government facilities while 350 injections were used to treat patients on 331 beds in private hospitals. According to an insider, private hospitals were using Remdesivir rampantly for instant success and also to inflate the bill and increase profit margin. “Remdesivir is available at Rs 800-1,000 to the distributor and retailers but their MRP is almost Rs4,500 and so on for the popular brands, which increases the profit margin,” said the source. Denying the allegations about malpractices by private hospitals, Dr Anup Marar, convener of Vidarbha Hospital Association, said that most of them are also having patients of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) who are also treated by Remdesivir injections with success. “A Covid negative patient may have a CT Scan report like that of a positive one, for whom Remdesivir is used. We are giving Remdesivir only when oral Favipiravir doesn’t work,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/remdesivir-use-in-govt-hospitals-32-in-pvt-ones-its-107-fda/articleshow/81995813.cms||Soumitra Bose

Vizag city and surrounding areas received good rainfall in 2020 and the temporary shutdown of many establishments in 2020 on the account of Covid-19 has eased burden on the groundwater table in Vizag region. M Nagamalleswara Rao, deputy director, groundwater department, Vizag, said the average depth to water level in March 2021 in Vizag district is 7.9 meters below the ground level (bgl) while it was 7.97 meters in March 2020. Similarly, the average depth to water level in May 2020 was 9.01 meters. The groundwater level will dip in April and May due to high temperatures and increase in the consumption of groundwater. “However, we are expecting that groundwater tables may not dip alarmingly in the coming months but people should not waste water,” he said. The data from core dashboard of the Andhra Pradesh government says that the groundwater table in coastal region (nine coastal districts) increased from 10.39 meters below the ground level (bgl) in March 2020, to 8.66 meters bgl in March 2021. Similarly, in Rayalaseema Region, the groundwater table increased from 17.55 meters bgl in March 2020, to 8.75 meters bgl in March 2021. The groundwater table level has been measured through piezometers installed in various locations of a district. The consumption of groundwater has been increasing in Vizag city’s outskirts as majority of the apartments are yet to connect to the GVMC water supply pipeline. The consumption also increased from January as construction activity has picked up and commercial units and industries reopened their business and educational institutes also reopened, said B Ganga Rao of CPI(M). The groundwater table may dip in summer, if indiscriminate consumption is not stopped during the summer season, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ample-groundwater-to-tide-through-summer/articleshow/81994279.cms||Nalla.Babu

The board has to be updated with the stock changes too. Earlier, collector had issued an order stating Remdesivir can be sold or purchased only from Covid hospitals and their attached pharmacies. On Friday, the shortage of Remdesivir had aggravated despite a consignment of around 6,000 vials reaching Nagpur depot as against demands of around 20,000-22,000 vials in Vidarbha. There was widespread discontentment among the Covid hospital managements regarding shortage of Remdesivir as many ran out of shock. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari too has alerted the civic administration and collector Ravindra Thakare regarding the black-marketing of Remdesivir asking for capping the drug’s price.Some of the hospitals had to shift their patients back to oral medications (Favipiravir) as Remdesivir injections did not arrive despite alerts sent to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and district administration control room and helpline at the collector office. Several citizens also kept on trying the collector office’s helpline (0712-2562668) for Remdesivir. According to hospital sources, inflated price was sought for some stock which had arrived. “I had placed an order for 500 vials but got 288 only,” said a doctor.Dr Anup Marar of Orange City Hospital and Research Institute said the stock dried up at his hospital after which the patients had to be shift back to oral medication. “The doctors were petrified to visit patients in the ward as they were blaming the hospital for the shortage of Remdesivir,” he said.Niranjan Joshi of Alexis Multispecialty Hospital said he had around 72 patients admitted. “We have stocks to last till Saturday 5pm. If no new stocks arrives, then we will also face a crisis,” he said. A man said his patient could not get Remdesivir even after trying for the entire day. “We ran from pillar to post but Remdesivir could not be arranged,” he said. In the meantime, collector and FDA authorities clarified consignments were reaching with stock in the Nagpur depot periodically, but nothing substantial had been demanded for April from the seven pharmaceuticals, as some media had reported. FDA sources also clarified that there was no letter sent to seven pharmaceuticals asking for 20,000 injections per day. “We have some Remdesivir stocks coming but not so much is present in the region as was reported,” said collector Ravidra Thakare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/collector-urges-pharmacies-to-display-remdesivir-stock/articleshow/81995842.cms||Soumitra Bose

Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh met Vijay Kalra, president of the Federation of Arhtiyas, but the meeting was inconclusive. Procurement of about 130 lakh metric tonnes of wheat will kick off in Punjab from Saturday. Punjab mandi board chairman Lal Singh has appealed to farmers to bring their produce in a staggered manner in view of the pandemic, for which passes are being issued through the arhtiyas. The boycott call can imperil this process. After the meeting with the CM, Kalra said, “We have decided to go ahead with our decision to go on strike. The state government did not spell out a clear system they plan to introduce... A meeting of the arhtiyas has been called on Saturday in Ludhiana.” Punjab food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu told TOI he was confident that the issue would be resolved by Saturday. “He (the CM) gave directions that such a new system should be put in place that the arhtiyas continue to be relevant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/amid-arhtiyas-strike-call-punjab-to-start-buying-wheat/articleshow/81998364.cms||Vibhor Mohan
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh govt plans PHS plants to support renewables||AMARAVATI: In what is described to be a gamechanger in stabilizing the power grid, the state government has set its focus on Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS) plants. Since supplies from solar and wind power plants are unpredictable and not completely reliable, it would result in fluctuations in the grid’s stability. In order to overcome these disadvantages, the grid needs a reliable fall back arrangement to compensate for variability of wind and solar power and to store excess or unusable energy from renewable sources, and therefore allow for better integration of these types of renewable energy into the grid. This is where PHS comes into the picture. In view of the expected growth in the share of renewable energy, the state government is setting up PHSs to bring balance to the grid. The state government has decided to promote Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS) power projects at all feasible locations both on river and off-river to generate power to balance the variable renewable energy power and to meet the peak energy demand. Energy minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy said that the state government has decided to promote renewable energy projects on multiple grounds--meeting growing energy demand, attracting investments, providing 24x7 power supply and maintaining grid balance. He said that RE power projects would help increase tax revenue by attracting huge private investment. In the normal course, the PHS work as conventional hydro power stations, but when they are not producing power, they are used as pumping stations that pump water from low level reservoir to the high level reservoir. PHS is hydel power, which is free from the effects of environmental hazards, thus curbing air and water pollution, easily adaptable to automation, remotely controllable and allows flexibility in operation schedules, said energy secretary Dr Nagulapalli Srikanth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-plans-phs-plants-to-support-renewables/articleshow/81994325.cms||Samdani MN

This is a unique agreement between a private not-for-profit organisation and a leading public sector bank to set up a guarantee fund, which is otherwise, usually set up by government bodies,” said Vinay Jaju of SwitchON Foundation. The basic aim of the fund is to help unbanked small marginal farmers without any collateral. A senior PNB Official of the Kolkata Zone said: “This novel joint initiative will provide finance for purchasing solar pumps for farming that will promote clean energy under different subsidy schemes of the government.” The foundation will be conducting farmer sensitisation, awareness drive and due diligence before finalising the disbursal of each loan. In east India, 96% of the farmers are small and marginal and “irrigation is essential to pull these farmers out of poverty, but they are overburdened with recurring diesel prices and high electricity bills,” said Surajit Chakraborty of the foundation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/loss-default-guarantee-fund-to-aid-solar-pump-buyers/articleshow/81995191.cms||---

It is improper,” he said adding a proper lockdown of around 15 days would ‘yield good results’ (of keeping Covid spike under check).“Some among the agitators could be carriers while others can get the infection from them. One never knows from where the infection may come,” he said.Sitabuldi Merchants’ Association on Friday postponed their action to open shops defying the restrictions laid down by the state government that has barred opening of non-essential shops across the state till April 30. Traders held demonstration against the Maha Vikas Aghadi government for half an hour.Parag Thakkar, executive member of SMA, said, “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in a Zoom meeting with traders had promised that he understands the issues and had said he would get back in two days with a relief plan.” All the traders of Maharashtra and Sitabuldi Merchants Association are positive about the outcome, traders told TOI.The traders were supposed to open the shops in protest today but withdrew since a positive decision was expected by them. “Our request to the authorities is to allow the traders to work full time. If that is not possible, they should fix time for essential services except medical stores and hospitals to operate from 6 am to 2 pm and non-essential businesses should be allowed to operate from 1 pm to 8 pm. This will reduce crowding and all will be able to work and not lose their livelihoods. If the decision is not in our favour, the association will decide on further action and continue with protests, traders suggested.Even senior corporator Abha Pande suggested that instead of complete lockdown for non-essential shops, the government should rethink on dividing the day into three shifts for both essential and non-essential activities. According to her, morning hours should be allotted for essential commodities and afternoon and evening reserved for trades of non-essential activities. “This way, traders can do business and administration can easily control crowds,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/collector-says-fortnight-long-lockdown-needed-to-curb-corona/articleshow/81996001.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said PM Narendra Modi should answer who took kickbacks in the deal even as his party alleged the contract caused a loss of over Rs 21,000 crore. “Dear students, the PM said answer questions without fear and nervousness. Please ask him to do the same: Who took money in the Rafale corruption scandal? Who deleted the anti-corruption clauses in the contract? Who gave middlemen access to key defence ministry documents?” Rahul tweeted. Priyanka too tweeted the same questions to the PM. Reacting to the allegations, Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad tweeted, “After failing as a part-time politician, has Rahul Gandhi switched to full-time lobbying? First he lobbied for fighter plane companies by trying to derail India’s acquisition programme. Now, he is lobbying for pharma companies by asking for arbitrary approvals for foreign vaccines.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-and-bjp-spar-over-rafale-again/articleshow/81998400.cms||---

Singh said this is a minor issue for the party and it will not give unnecessary importance to him and give him publicity. "BJP has zero faith in him. These are all small things. I don't want to take his name and make him famous," Singh added. He refused to react when asked about Yatnal's growing popularity. Recently, Yatnal hit out at Singh saying, "Singh should know he is in charge of Karnataka and not in charge of Yediyurappa and his son.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/remarks-against-karnataka-cm-basanagouda-patil-yatnal-may-be-expelled-soon-says-bjp-national-secretary-arun-singh/articleshow/81998417.cms||---

The new rules have been framed and notified after the authority found several instances where builders were transferring real estate projects to other entities without clear obligations being specified. RERA has also framed rules for its own functioning, all of which come into effect immediately, RERA chairperson S Kumaraswamy, a retired IAS officer, said. The Real Estate (Regulation & Development) Act, 2016, allows each phase of a real estate project to be considered as a stand-alone project, and the builder can obtain registration for each phase separately. However, the authority in Goa noticed that builders would take development permission for the entire plot, but register the projects phase-wise without providing details of the entire project. “In order to determine the area of the phase-wise/part development, the authority decided to regulate the same,” Kumaraswamy said. “If a developer desires to develop the plot in a phase-wise manner, for which a single composite approval from the competent authority has been taken, the promoter shall have to indicate phase-wise development with all the phases and area details, along with a rough sketch plan demarcating the different phases of the development and its plot area, duly signed by the promoter.” Kumaraswamy also said that the Goa RERA office is receiving cases of projects being transferred to other firms or entities after obtaining registration. To safeguard the interests of all stakeholders, it has decided to specify the obligations and norms to be followed by project promoters. The permissions for transfer of projects will be granted via an online application. Before transfer of any project, prior written consent of two thirds of the project allottees will be required. “The original developer of the project will have to submit details of the third party through an online prescribed format. They will also have to submit the development agreement signed between the promoter and the third party, duly registered by the competent authority, laying down the roles and responsibilities of each party,” Kumaraswamy said. A draft copy of the agreement for sale, as per the model form of agreement, will have to be submitted along with a fresh affidavit with all details.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rera-specifies-norms-for-transfer-of-real-estate-projects/articleshow/81996038.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Bengaluru||Curfew will hit business hard sans benefits: Bengaluru traders||BENGALURU: The Corona Curfew clamped from Saturday in eight cities will do harm more than curb the spread of the pandemic, said representatives of business and industries. They pointed out that this comes at a time when the sectors were just about recovering from lockdown losses. Shopping malls, supermarkets and standalone outlets may be the worst hit by the 10-day night curfew and they’re worried about missing out on Ugadi shopping over the weekend. Retailers said they’ll be forced to shut shop before 8pm to ensure employees reach home before the curfew kicks in at 10pm. “Shops will miss out on the peak business hour. While it’s an inevitable step to create awareness, I hope the curfew will not continue beyond ten days,” said Uday Garudahar, owner of Garuda Mall and BJP MLA. Experts observed that steps like night curfew will be counter-productive and asserted that extension of business hours would be more effective. “There’s a possibility of crowds before the curfew. The best thing the government can do is extend business hours late into the night with proper SOPs to restrict number of people at a time. This will ensure less crowds as well as continuity of business,” said Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO, Retailers Association of India. Stakeholders of the health sector concur. “The night curfew at best may serve as a warning against the pandemic. What we need is avoiding congregation of people and crowding at market places and other areas,” said Dr Sudarshan Ballal, chairman, Manipal Hospitals. Restaurants, pubs and cinema halls are worried about the negative impact. “The peak business for restaurants and pubs starts at 8.30pm. With this night curfew, hotels need to close before 8pm and it’s as good as shutting shop for the whole day given few footfall during the day,” said PC Rao, president, Bruhat Bengaluru Hotels Association. Industries are still confused about guidelines for night curfew, although the government has allowed them to continue with night shifts with the rider that employees must reach the workplace before the curfew kicks in. “How can employees working in the second shift reach home as work ends around 10pm? The worry is that the situation may lead to employees staying away from work and industries suffering from labour shortage,” said TR Parasurama, president, Bangalore Chamber of Industry and Commerce.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/curfew-will-hit-business-hard-sans-benefits-bengaluru-traders/articleshow/81998368.cms||B V Shiva Shankar
---||Goa||Goa: Three-day vaccination drive in villages from today||PANAJI: Health minister Vishwajit Rane on Friday announced that apart from ‘Tika Utsav’, the mass vaccination drive announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to be held from April 11 to 14, the directorate of health services will simultaneously conduct vaccination drives in villages for three days from Saturday. “In the first phase, we will conduct vaccination in villages that have the necessary infrastructure and our people are checking on it,” Rane told reporters. Goa’s daily average of doses administered has been between little over 4,000 though the directorate of health services wants to vaccinate about 5,000 people every day, so that it can cover 3 lakh people by the end of May. The state has seen a slight improvement after the vaccination was thrown open to people who are 45-year-old and above beginning this month. Rane said they have received suggestions from officials as to how to enhance the vaccination and a meeting was held during the day to work out the modalities. “We can’t lose hope because people are not coming forward to get the jab. We have to make efforts to reach out to them as some require more explanation to get convinced,” he said. He said that the PM has been reiterating that people shouldn’t stop wearing masks after getting vaccinated. The vaccination is a way forward when hit by the second wave of Covid-19. “Nobody anticipated that in the second wave, the cases would rise exponentially. People who are eligible must take the vaccine so that cases do not rise and mortalities remain under control,” Rane said. He said the vaccination drive is being conducted on Sundays and holidays as well so that maximum people can be vaccinated in the shortest possible time. The regular outpatient departments (OPDs) and functioning of non-Covid departments will not be halted due to the vaccination drive, the health minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/three-day-vax-drive-in-villages-from-today/articleshow/81996178.cms||---
---||Goa||As cases rise, schools await SOPs, struggle to keep infections at bay||Panaji: Covid-19 cases are on the rise in the state and the government has announced that new SOPs will be issued to schools with regards to permitting students of higher classes to enter the institute premises. The spread in cases has meant a struggle for schools to balance safety and academics. Students from Classes IX to XII have been attending classes physically from November 11, 2020, as per DoE instructions. While instructions have been issued on Friday to conduct ongoing Classes IX and XI exams in the online mode, Classes X and XII students are still attending physical classes after their prelims, to get their doubts cleared by teachers in the run-up to the state board exams. “We have already put a system in place where Class X students have to first schedule a meeting with the teacher over WhatsApp. This is to ensure social distancing,” said the trustee of a school in Panaji, as cases in the capital witnessed a steady increase. It is especially urban schools with high enrolment, who are finding it difficult to cope with the situation. “In village schools, where the number of students is small and teachers know the families personally, they are having no issues with students coming to schools. In schools in urban areas like ours, there are 350 students in Class X and teachers do not know the students’ background well. As cases are on the rise, there has been a delay in SOPs from the DoE. So, for our safety, we had planned the Class IX exams online even before the DoE instructions came in. When revision for Class X students is held, we call only 50% of the students to school at a time,” said the manager of an institute in Quepem taluka. A few schools have already managed to finish their Class IX exams by scheduling them earlier than usual so as to avoid any disruptions in academics due to the rise in Covid cases. In one high enrolment school in South Goa, two teachers and an equal number of students were found infected with coronavirus following practicals and revision sessions held for Class X students. “Unfortunately, this year too, the coronavirus cases have shown a rise around the same time as last year, when the final exams for the academic year are in progress. Besides worrying for their safety, teachers are also struggling with the consequences of last year’s instructions from the state to promote all Class IX and XI students, without even a supplementary exam,” said a teacher from a South Goa school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-cases-rise-schools-await-sops-struggle-to-keep-infections-at-bay/articleshow/81996204.cms||---

Rahul also sought direct income support to the poor in view of the second wave besides opening up vaccination to all. He said there was no reason why over six crore doses of vaccines were exported while opposition-governed states highlighting shortages were receiving “intemperate statements” from the Union health minister. “Was the export of vaccines also an ‘oversight’, like many other decisions of this government, or an effort to garner publicity?” he asked. “Rahul Gandhi must know that shortage in Congress-governed states is not of vaccines but of basic commitment towards healthcare,” Prasad tweeted. “He (Rahul) should write letters to his party’s governments to stop their ‘vasooli’ (extortion) ventures and concentrate on administering the lakhs of vaccines they are sitting on,” he added. Rahul claimed large sections of the poor were excluded from vaccination due to mandatory online registration. Accusing the PM of self-promotion, he wrote, “Our vaccination programme has to move beyond an individual’s picture on the vaccine certificate.” He also sought doubling of central allocation for vaccine procurement from the present Rs 35,000 crore. “Apart from vaccination, there needs to be adequate focus on testing, tracing and treating. Rahul Gandhi’s problem is that he doesn’t understand all this and his ignorance is compounded by his arrogance,” Prasad said. “Why has Rahul Gandhi not yet taken the vaccine? ... has he already taken one on many of his undisclosed trips to foreign locations,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nation-starved-of-vaccine-curb-exports-rahul-gandhi/articleshow/81998421.cms||---

The Captain of Ports (CoP) department met the salvors, the barge owner and MPT officials to take stock of the situation on Friday. CoP has also issued notices to the crew of the vessel to appear before the officer who is investigating the incident. “The crew has been called on 12 and the owner has been asked to ensure that they are present at the COP office. If they don’t turn up then action will be taken against them,” said a CoP official. He added that the owner of MV Surya and the salvage firms are expected to visit the site where the barge sank to prepare a salvage strategy. “A site visit is likely to be held on Saturday or on Monday with the salvors along with MPT to assess the wreck and decide on the way to remove the vessel. The insurance firm will finalize the salvage firm,” said the COP official. The barge, which had a valid Indian register of shipping (IRS) certification, sank while being loaded with iron ore fines. One of the eight crew members onboard succumbed to injuries in the incident. A loaded barge sank at one of MPT’s mooring dolphins on April 5, leaving one of the eight crew members dead.

Mamata questioned whether the model code only applied to her, not to PM Narendra Modi and Shah. “Prime Minister eto ulto-palta kotha bole, tatey code violation hoye na (When the PM says things he shouldn’t, then the code isn’t violated). He campaigns on an election day. We would have stopped doing it if they didn’t. Pariksha pe charcha... you do your discussions in other states, why Bengal? Elections are going on here. Then no code is violated,” she said, adding, “Amit Shah speaks nonsense daily. Then no code is violated. And when Mamata Banerjee addresses people, it violates the code.... You (the EC) have show-caused me several times before, too. Why? I was not even allowed to campaign a day before the elections. You are changing everything. Every day you are doing what BJP is asking you to do. Who is BJP to you? And what do you think of me? That three people can do whatever they think?” Mamata asked people not to listen to anyone if they “come to you in police dress and ask you not to vote”. The CM also accused the BJP of “deliberately fomenting trouble”. “If you are winning so easily, why are you attacking Trinamool candidates daily? Yesterday, my Mathabhanga candidate — a member of the Rajbonshi SC community — was beaten up. He is in hospital. Sujata Mondal, my SC candidate in Arambag, was assaulted.

Asoke Chakraborty held the rank of a police superintendent in the Directorate of Security. It is believed that Chakraborty’s removal is the result of the ongoing probe into security lapses that led to CM Banerjee — a Z-plus protectee — being injured in Nandigram on March 10. The officer had served as the CM’s PSO for 10 years and 11 months. He always accompanied her when she stepped out of Kolkata. He was a PSO to Banerjee even when she was Union railway minister. Chakraborty began his career with the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and was later promoted to security commissioner. He was on deputation in Bengal and, after retirement from the railways, continued as an OSD. The EC has sought his immediate removal. On March 15, the poll panel had ordered the removal of state director (security) Vivek Sahay and suspension of East Midnapore SP Pravin Prakash. It transferred district magistrate Vibhu Goel in connection with the incident. Gyanwant Singh was made the new director of security.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ec-removes-mamatas-pso-over-nandigram-incident/articleshow/81998450.cms||Debasis Konar

Addressing a virtual press conference on Friday, Vijayawada divisional railway manager (DRM) P Srinivas said that the major drop in revenue was due to fewer train operations during the pandemic. Passenger revenue in 2020–21 dropped by a whopping 81% to a mere Rs 219.84 crore. Interestingly, freight business served as solace accounting for 88% of the division’s overall revenue. On April 8, the division created a record by servicing 242 goods trains (122 trains dispatched and 120 received). The previous best was 222 goods trains, achieved on February 14, 2021. “In spite of challenges, the division has captured many new streams of traffic such as fly ash, soyabean oil and fish feed due to the dedicated efforts of the business development unit,” said the DRM. On the brighter side, the pandemic was an opportunity for the division to quickly finish outstanding projects. The DRM said that the division commissioned three new railway lines: third line between Kavali and Ulavapadu, double lines between Gudivada and Machilipatnam and another between Uppaluru and Moturu. The division also electrified the Vijayawada to Uppaluru and Gudivada to Machilipatnam town branch lines. The DRM said that the division lost 18 lives to Covid-19. Meanwhile, railway officials have noted an increase in migrant workers returning to their native places fearing lockdown curbs as Covid-19 cases continue to rise. Taking cognisance of the matter, the DRM said that there hasn’t been much spike within the railway division. Railway officials made it clear that train services will continue to run normally and appealed to the public to not fall prey to any lockdown-related rumours on social media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vijayawada-rly-division-sees-37-drop-in-overall-revenue/articleshow/81993963.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

A crime and forensics team also visited the spot to collect evidence. Locals have told police that at least half a dozen rounds were fired. DCP (Rohini) Pranav Tayal said that they have set up multiple teams to trace the assailants at the earliest. CCTV footage is being checked to identify the attackers. A case of murder and attempt to murder and under other relevant sections has been registered at KN Katju Marg police station,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/1-killed-1-wounded-as-man-fires-after-fight-at-cng-pump-in-delhis-rohini/articleshow/81998463.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Shot supply: Kolkata hospitals start to ration jabs as stocks dwindle||KOLKATA: Bengal vaccinated a shade less than 8 lakh people over the last three days, but several Kolkata hospitals started rationing their doses from Friday over fears that their vaccine stocks would completely run dry by Sunday. Several hospitals had to turn away vaccine-seekers, while others shut down their vaccination units earlier than usual as stocks began to run out at storehouses across the city, echoing a trend reported from several states across the country amid a surging second wave of the pandemic. Most hospitals received fewer vials than their daily requirement and feared that vaccination might grind to a halt on Saturday, since stocks were low at the state government’s distribution centres and there being no assurance of replenishments arriving anytime soon. Even as 21 lakh doses of Covishield had been allotted to the state a few days ago, health officials were informed that the consignment would arrive only between April 15 and 20. State family welfare officer Ashim Das Malakar feared stocks would run dry by Sunday. “We are trying to keep the supply chain going somehow. We have been told that arrangements are being made to bring forward the despatch schedule for 21 lakh doses of Covishield. But no confirmation has come yet,” he added. Health department officials said the limited stocks had forced them to ration the supply of vaccines, in order to ensure that no centre got shut down. The state has also written to the Centre to urgently send more stocks. Scores of hopefuls returned disappointed from Peerless Hospital, which shut down its vaccination sites at 5pm on Friday, an hour before the scheduled closing time. “Instead of 28 vials, which we had been receiving so far, we got a mere 10 vials or 100 doses,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. “Fortunately, we had some old stocks, so we could vaccinate around 200. Since there is yet no guarantee of new stocks reaching the borough 12 office, from where we source the vaccines, we may have to remain shut on Saturday.” Many who had queued up at ILS Hospital, Dum Dum, were turned away. The hospital authorities claimed that only those who insisted on Covishield were refused, since stocks had run out. “But we still have enough Covaxin and those willing to take it received the shot on Friday. But stocks are low,” said ILS Hospitals vice-president Debashis Dhar. Some recipients said they had been refused even after agreeing to Covishield shots. “Just as we were about to leave, they said one vial was available and I luckily got a shot. But it was extremely chaotic and those in charge were not sure if recipients should be asked to wait,” said 75-year-old Dum Dum resident Dipali Ghosh, who received her jab at ILS. RN Tagore International International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) received 25 vials on Friday, instead of its daily quota of 35. While many were refused, the hospital authorities feared that refusals could rise sharply over the next two days as supplies plunged further. “This weekend could see vaccination numbers drop, as stocks have not been arriving. We have been told that supplies would be low till fresh stocks arrive. But we have no idea how soon stocks could be replenished,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) clinics, too, ran out of stocks early on Friday. A majority of the KMC’s 80 clinics were absolutely dry and wouldn’t be able to vaccinate unless fresh stocks arrive on Saturday, civic officials said. In fact, the supply to all vaccination centres, cutting across private and government facilities, got reduced between 30% and 50% on Friday. The Beliaghata ID Hospital got only 20 vials of Covishield on Friday against the 30-40 vials it used to get daily till Friday. “We got just about 60% of the stock that we would get on a daily basis. So, we might be forced to reduce the intake of beneficiaries,” said a source at Medica Superspecialty Hospital. Other hospitals, too, did not sound hopeful. “We had requisitioned 35 vials of Covishield for Friday but we got an allotment of 20. We do not know what will happen from tomorrow,” said Pradip Tondon, CEO, Belle Vue Clinic. AMRI Hospital, Salt Lake, said it would put up a “no vaccine” board on Saturday, as it did not expect any new supplies soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/shot-supply-hosps-start-to-ration-jabs-as-stocks-dwindle/articleshow/81996844.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||---||Battle for West Bengal’s soul enters urban heartland||KOLKATA: When a large swathe of urban and semi-urban south Bengal — representing the Trinamool’s core support base — goes to vote on Saturday, something more than party loyalties will be tested. Also on test will be how much Bengal’s upper- and middle-class bhadralok population has warmed to a party that, till even two years ago, was considered somewhat alien in most Bengali homes. As many as seven ministers (including heavyweights like Partha Chatterjee and Aroop Biswas), assembly speaker Biman Banerjee, BJP MP Babul Supriyo, prominent Tollywood stars (like Srabonti, Payal Sarkar, Lovely Maitra and Yash Dasgupta) and even a former Trinamool heavyweight’s estranged wife, Ratna Chatterjee, are seeking election from constituencies in and around south Kolkata, making this round easily the most keenly watched in the 2021 assembly poll. Add some of the seats on the other side of the Hooghly to the mix — like Domjur (former Trinamool minister Rajib Banerjee is seeking re-election here but on a BJP ticket), Uttarpara (popular screen personality Kanchan Mallick is the Trinamool candidate), Shibpur (former India cricketer Manoj Tiwary is contesting on a Trinamool ticket) and Chinsurah (where BJP MP Locket Chatterjee is a candidate) — and you have a round with the largest share of VIP politicians and celebrities contesting the election. Not every heavyweight, however, is looking at an easy win. The BJP’s decision to field Supriyo against minister Biswas from Tollygunge has made this one of the most closely fought battles in this entire election. Kasba and, even more so, Jadavpur — with pockets of stable Left support base — are seats where the contest may end up three-way rather than two. And the southern suburbs of the city — places like Sonarpur — will test how much the BJP has been able to make a dent in the TMC’s core middle- and lower-class suburban support base. In 2019, Trinamool led in most of these south Kolkata pockets. The Trinamool in 2019 managed to get over a 40% vote share in the two Behala seats, Tollygunge, Jadavpur, Kasba and the two Sonarpur seats. But the BJP too crossed the 30% mark in several of these constituencies — Kasba, Behala and the Sonarpur seats — in 2019, showing how close Bengal’s current number two party was behind the Trinamool. What also makes this round fascinating is the fact that every slice of the state’s electorate — both the urban (upper, middle and lower) classes and the suburban electorate, both Hindu farmers and Muslim farmers, both Bengalis and other linguistic groups (Punjabis, Gujaratis, Malayalis, Tamils, Biharis and Uttar Pradesh natives) and both upper castes and Scheduled Castes — has a significant presence in many of these constituencies. These groups bring into play all the issues that have been harped on by politicians — the “idea of Bengal”, the need for industries and jobs, the fight for agricultural land, corruption in lower-level governance and even the rights of Tollywood artistes and technicians — making this round critical for all parties. Winning Bengal without winning this round will render hollow the claim that the winner is truly representative of Bengal’s electorate, however much be its majority in the assembly. This round also has one seat with the highest female gender ratio in Bengal: Jadavpur (1,068 female voters for every 1,000 male voters). Five other seats — Behala (West), Tollygunge, Behala (East) and Sonarpur (both North and south) — too have net-positive female gender ratios, making Trinamool campaign managers hopeful of reaping the “gender dividend” of the party’s “Bangla Nijer Meyekei Chay” campaign focusing on CM Mamata Banerjee. Another critical sub-plot — the defection saga — has played out in many of these seats, making net-gainer BJP optimistic about its chances. Banerjee’s key aides in the anti-land acquisition stir in Singur, Rabindranath Bhattacharya and Becharam Manna, are now pitted against each other; the BJP led the Trinamool in Singur in 2019. The Trinamool was number two in several other Hooghly seats like Serampore, Chinsurah, Balagarh, Pandua and Saptagram. Howrah follows a somewhat similar trajectory. Another prominent Trinamool rebel, Rajib Banerjee, seeks re-election from Domjur. This constituency, however, has a minority voting population of around 40%, making the former cabinet minister focus on his “development work” rather than the aggressive Hindutva line followed by the likes of Suvendu Adhikari. BJP votes surged in Howrah in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls; the Trinamool scraped through in Bally by a mere 295 votes and lost Howrah (North). The BJP approximated the 40% vote-share mark in Shibpur, Howrah (Central) and Howrah (South) as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/battle-for-bengals-soul-enters-urban-heartland/articleshow/81998865.cms||---

The incident is three days old. Based on a complaint by IGMCH administration, police have registered a case against the veterinarian. IGMCH senior medical superintendent Dr Janak Raj Pakhretia said the incident took place on April 7. He said the veterinarian himself was Covid positive, but without any symptoms and he himself had requested to be an attendant for his parents. “His parents are recovering well and are stable. We don’t know why the veterinarian tried to end his life?” he said. Sources said the veterinarian had cut his wrists with a sharp-edged object, which was noticed by doctors and staff present in the ward, and they provided him treatment. The vertinarian’s condition is stable now. His wife has also tested positive and is in home isolation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/covid-infected-veterinarian-tries-to-end-life-at-igmch-booked/articleshow/81995563.cms||---

The hospital, which is owned and operated by the Bokaro Steel Limited (BSL), is only admitting critical Covid-19 patients from the general public in a bid to prevent shortage of beds. “A team of doctors will attend calls and advice the patients on medicines and the further course of treatment round the clock. If needed, the doctors will also tell the patients whether they need hospitalisation,” a BGH official told TOI on Friday. However, the BGH is yet to make public its helpdesk number. As on Friday morning, Bokaro had 330 active cases, of which 90 were undergoing treatment in hospitals. The Bokaro administration is planning to turn a school building into a Covid care centre (CCC) and has approached the BSL management for the same. “The BSL has assured to provide us with a 40-room school building for setting up a CCC,” DC Rajesh Singh said. Besides setting up new facilities, plans are afoot to equip existing CCCs with oxygen-supported beds. “We will equip 25 beds with oxygen in the CCCs at Jaina Moad and Bermo, besides adding oxygen beds at the ANM Centre in Camp -2,” civil surgeon Dr A K Pathak said. At present, the BGH is the only hospital in Bokaro to have dedicated Covid-19 wards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bgh-to-float-helpline-for-patients-in-home-isolation/articleshow/81994969.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||EC removes Mamata’s PSO over Nandigram incident||Kolkata: The Election Commission on Friday removed an officer on special duty (OSD) from chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s security detail. Asoke Chakraborty held the rank of a police superintendent in the Directorate of Security. It is believed that Chakraborty’s removal is the result of the ongoing probe into security lapses that led to CM Banerjee — a Z-plus protectee — being injured in Nandigram on March 10. The officer had served as the CM’s personal security officer (PSO) for 10 years and 11 months since May 2011. He always accompanied her when she stepped out of Kolkata. He was a PSO to Banerjee even when she was the Union railway minister. Chakraborty had started his career with the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and was later promoted to the rank of a security commissioner. He was on deputation in Bengal and after retirement from railways, continued as an OSD. The EC has sought his immediate removal. On March 15, the poll panel had ordered the removal of state director (security) Vivek Sahay, suspension of East Midnapore SP Pravin Prakash and transferred district magistrate Vibhu Goel in connection with the incident. Gyanwant Singh was made the new director of security.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ec-removes-mamatas-pso-over-nandigram-incident/articleshow/81996003.cms||---
---||Kolkata||It seems Bengal is under prez rule, Shah is running the show: Mamata||Jamalpur/Memari: CM Mamata Banerjee on Friday said it appeared Bengal was “under Article 356”, alleging it wasn’t the Election Commission, but Union home minister Amit Shah who was running Bengal, and remaining unfazed by the second EC notice on her. “Ete amar kichhu eshe jay na (I’m not bothered),” she said, referring to the fresh notice against her, adding that she would respond that “she was with people, still remains with people and will continue to do so in the future”. She maintained that she would keep speaking against central forces as long as they “they work for BJP”, and salute them “the moment they stop working for BJP”. Banerjee questioned whether the model code only applied to her, not to PM Narendra Modi and Shah. “PM says things he shouldn’t, then the code isn’t violated. He campaigns on election day. Pariksha pe charcha... you do your discussions in other states, why Bengal? Elections are going on here. Then no code is violated,” she said. The CM said, “Amit Shah speaks nonsense daily. Then no code is violated. And when Mamata Banerjee addresses people, it violates the the code.... You (the EC) have showcaused me several times before, too. Why? I was not even allowed to campaign a day before the elections. You are changing everything. Every day you are doing what BJP is asking you to do. Who is BJP to you? And what do you think of me? That three people can do whatever they think?” “People are with Trinamool Congress. It isn’t easy to finish it,” Banerjee said, asking people not to listen to anyone if they “comes to you in police dress and asks you not to vote”. The CM also accused the BJP of “deliberately fomenting trouble”. “If you are winning so easily, why are you attacking Trinamool candidates daily? Yesterday, my Mathabhanga candidate — a member of the Rajbonshi SC community — was beaten up. He is in hospital. Sujata Mondal, my SC candidate in Arambag, was assaulted. Her security guard — a Bengal police officer — has a fractured skull. Rabin Manna, a Trinamool Congress worker in Nandigram, about whom I spoke several times before, died today in SSKM hospital. BJP has killed him. And the person responsible was grabbing votes. Police did nothing,” she said. “If I understand people, I challenge you, BJP is never going to win. They will create trouble for a day. We are going to be there 365 days. Why will you be scared?” The CM said she “respected” the central forces and state police. “But I do not support Amit Shah. He is instructing police to do all the wrong things. It isn’t the Election Commission, but Amit Shah. He says CAPF is working under EC. They are working for Amit Shah. All instructions are being issued by Amit Shah’s office. I know they may even plan to kill me. I am not bothered. I will keep fighting like a tiger. We respect the country’s jawans. I salute them but I will not salute Amit Shah, under whose instructions they are working,” she said, adding, “I would urge the Prime Minister to control his home minister. The way he is inciting trouble isn’t bringing BJP a good name. Sensing imminent defeat, they will try to manipulate... Amit Shah is planning; they will try to stir violence and riots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/it-seems-bengal-is-under-prez-rule-shah-is-running-the-show-mamata/articleshow/81996839.cms||Mohammad Asif
---||Kolkata||West Bengal assembly elections: Election Commission sends second notice to CM Mamata Banerjee for ‘restrain CAPF’ speech||KOLKATA: The Election Commission has issued a second notice to Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, this one for her comments asking voters — particularly women — to “restrain” central forces if the latter “create disturbances”. The EC found Banerjee’s comments — made during election speeches in Cooch Behar on March 28 and April 7 — “prima facie... in violation” of the model of conduct in place for the ongoing poll as well as some IPC sections. The poll panel has given Banerjee time till 11 am on Saturday to respond. The first EC notice to Banerjee came on Wednesday for her comments in Tarakeswar last weekend, asking “minority voters” to ensure their votes were not split. Banerjee has not yet responded to the first notice. But she has said in her election speeches that she will not be intimidated by these notices and will go on urging people not to vote on the basis of religion. Banerjee and her party have also questioned the EC’s neutrality and asked how many notices it has sent to PM Modi. The Trinamool has also questioned why most BJP leaders have not got EC notices despite making communal speeches. The latest EC notice is based on the state chief electoral officer’s report and authorised transcripts of a speech Banerjee delivered in Cooch Behar on April 7, where she is heard telling women voters to “restrain (gherao) CAPF (personnel) if they create disturbances”. One group should be doing this while another group should go and vote, Banerjee said. “Don’t waste your vote. They will be happy if you do not cast your vote. This is their plan. It is the BJP’s plan. Talking to them (CAPF personnel) will be tantamount to restraining them. You don’t have to gherao them literally,” she added. The EC letter accused the Bengal CM of of making “prima facie, completely false, provocative and intemperate statements... to berate and vilify central paramilitary forces during the electoral process” that caused “extreme demoralisation among these forces”. “They have made a commendable contribution, especially in ensuring area-domination and deterring anti-social hooligans, to conduct free and fair polls,” the letter added. “Far more discouraging is the fact that she has been trying to make an emotional pitch to women voters to incite them to attack central force personnel. It is extremely unfortunate that political battles are fought in this manner,” the EC wrote. The EC is also scanning a March 28 speech delivered by Banerjee. “There is no reason to be afraid of the police. Who gave so much power to them that the central police are threatening women... (and not) allowing them to cast their votes? I saw the same thing in 2019. I saw the same thing in 2016,” the EC quoted the Bengal CM as saying. “Women of Bhagabanpur (in East Midnapore) returned with tears,” Banerjee reportedly said, telling CAPF personnel to “remember that you did not let blind voters cast their votes”. “You did not let many mothers and sisters cast their votes. You targeted women. It is not the central police’s business but still they denied entry to voters for not wearing masks,” the EC notice quoted Banerjee. The EC also said she had exhorted women to “attack central forces with ladles and kitchen spuds” if they “suffered a a single stroke of the baton”. The EC also mentioned that a Trinamool delegation had, in February, accused the Border Security Force of intimidating villagers to vote in favour of a particular political party. Chief election commissioner Sunil Arora, however, had rubbished the Trinamool allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ec-sends-2nd-notice-to-cm-for-restrain-capf-speech/articleshow/81996804.cms||---
---||Ranchi||‘Migrant’ train from Mumbai to reach Ranchi tomorrow||RANCHI: The Indian Railways will be operating special trains from Maharashtra and Gujarat to meet the rush of migrant workers queuing up at the railway stations to reach their homes in Jharkhand. In a statement issued on Friday, the Ranchi railway division of the South Eastern Railways said a special train left for Ranchi railway station from Mumbai’s Lokmanya Tilak Terminus on Friday night. The train will arrive in the state capital on Sunday morning after making stops at Itarsi, Mughalsarai, Gaya and Bokaro. There are 12 general sitting coaches, five sleeper coaches and four air-conditioned coaches in the train. Though the railways announced several special trains from Mumbai to Bihar which will operate once every week, the train between Mumbai to Ranchi will be a single trip. The buzz among Ranchi division is that the train has been introduced to ferry migrant workers to Jharkhand. “With 12 general sitting coaches, it is clear that the objective is to accommodate as many passengers as possible from the low income groups,” an official in the division said on condition of anonymity. Another special train between Surat station in Gujarat and Hatia station in Ranchi will ply from the second week of April. The train will make seven trips between April 15 and May 21. However, Ranchi divisional railway manager Neeraj Ambasth said there has not been any official directive from the railways on running Shramik Special trains. “Neither has the state requested us for the same,” he added. The DRM also claimed that the division will continue to operate special and festival special express trains and passenger trains which are in operation now. “At the moment, there are 49 specials and 12 passenger trains which are being run from the division. These trains will continue. If need be, we will add more according to the rush,” he told reporters. In Jamshedpur, Chakradharpur DRM V K Sahoo said there is no plan to suspend trains on the Howrah-Mumbai route owing to the surge in Covid-19 cases in the country. The DRM said presently 45 long distance mail and express trains, including four weekly trains and 13 short distance trains, are running (originating/passing through) in the division. Separate teams of the RPF are conducting surveillance on moving trains to make commuters wear face masks.

The number of active cases in the state crossed the 10,000-mark again for the first time since October 6. About 7.5% of the 25,718 samples tested through the day returned a positive result. With eight deaths in Ranchi alone, the city recorded its highest single-day death toll and accounted for 754 new infections, about 100 lesser than Thursday. The number of active cases in the city jumped to 5,217, the first time it has been above the 5,000-mark since the outbreak started, with most hospitals running out of dedicated Covid beds. Apart from Ranchi, while East Singhbhum recorded three deaths, Dhanbad two and Sahebganj, Palamu, Gumla and Chatra reported one each. Saturday’s death toll is second highest till date in Jharkhand while Ranchi reported its highest casualty figures. Jharkhand had recorded 19 deaths on September 8 and September 11 during the peak of the first wave. A total of seven doctors, including a physiotherapist, tested positive for covid-19 at Ranchi district hospital and the OPD operations have been closed until further orders. Sources said some of these doctors have received both doses of the vaccine. Among other districts, East Singhbhum recorded 256 fresh infections, Dhanbad got 94, Dumka 70, Koderma 65, Palamu 64, and Bokaro and Khunti 61 each. All 24 districts recorded new cases for the fourth straight day on Friday.

The court also observed that the civil surgeon cannot play with the lives of people and he should tender his resignation if he cannot do his job. The division bench while hearing a petition on the poor infrastructure of Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) brought up the action of the civil surgeon before the health department secretary K K Soan. Soan was appearing through the virtual mode in the public interest litigation. The bench comprising Chief Justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad informed that samples of employees of the high court have been collected by the sadar hospital for testing of coronavirus. The samples were collected on April 5 and yet the results are awaited, the court said. Chief Justice Dr Ravi Ranjan said that it was careless on the part of the civil surgeon to sit over the samples for the past four days. The samples will decompose before the tests are done and the result will not be accurate. It is a question of life and death of an individual, the Chief Justice observed. The court sought a detailed report from the civil surgeon and will hear the matter again on April 12. The judges expressing their dismay also observed that if samples of employees of the high court are not sent for testing without showing any exigency, then the condition of the common mass can well be imagined. The court was hearing a PIL initiated suo motu on the poor condition of Rims, the largest hospital in the state. The court had taken up the issue after reports in the media exposed the fact that Rims does not have its own CT scan machine. The bench has been following up the matter on a routine basis and had queried about commissioning of additional 300 beds in the sadar hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hc-pulls-up-ranchi-civil-surgeon-for-delay-in-sending-samples-for-covid-testing/articleshow/81994963.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Owaisi lashes out at both BJP and Trinamool||Malda/ Sagardighi: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Friday trained guns on both PM Narendra Modi and CM Mamata Banerjee, saying both BJP and TMC kept Muslims at the receiving end. “There’s no difference between Modi and Mamata. They help each other and Muslims remain at the receiving end,” he said. Owaisi hit out at the Bengal CM using the same charge Banerjee has been heaping on AIMIM. “She (Mamata) has a tacit understanding with the RSS. She has made way for the BJP in the state,” he said. “A total 27% of the state population are Muslims but very few get government jobs. Even 15% of Muslim children belonging to 6-14 years age group remain out of school education. Who is responsible for such deprivation?” he asked, addressing gatherings at Malatipur in Malda and Itahar in North Dinajpur on Thursday in support of AIMIM candidates. Owaisi, speaking at an impressive gathering at Malatipur in support of Matiur Rahman, said: “Malda, Murshidabad and Dinajpur people have no work. Huge number of youths migrate to other states for jobs. Most of them are Muslims. The government has done nothing for them. Even the Left Front and the Congress did nothing.” Malatipur has a 70% minority population. Itahar, too, has 50% Muslim voters. Fielding AIMIM candidates in such constituencies will certainly affect the election scenario. The split in Muslim voters might help the BJP in these seats, Trinamool leaders said. Owaisi sharply reacted to the charge. “We were not there during the last general election. The BJP won both Malda Uttar and Balurghat among the 18 in the state. Then how could we be the B-team of BJP?” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/owaisi-lashes-out-at-both-bjp-and-trinamool/articleshow/81996137.cms||Subhro Maitra

What also makes this round fascinating is the fact that every slice of the state’s electorate — both the urban (upper, middle and lower) classes and the suburban electorate, both Hindu farmers and Muslim farmers, both Bengalis and other linguistic groups (Punjabis, Gujaratis, Malayalis, Tamils, Biharis and Uttar Pradesh natives) and both upper castes and Scheduled Castes — has a significant presence in many of these constituencies. These groups bring into play all the issues that have been harped on by politicians — the “idea of Bengal”, the need for industries and jobs, the fight for agricultural land, corruption in lower-level governance and even the rights of Tollywood artistes and technicians — making this round critical for all parties. Winning Bengal without winning this round will render hollow the claim that the winner is truly representative of Bengal’s electorate, however much be its majority in the assembly. This round also has one seat with the highest female gender ratio in Bengal: Jadavpur (1,068 female voters for every 1,000 male voters). Five other seats — Behala (West), Tollygunge, Behala (East) and Sonarpur (both North and south) — too have net-positive female gender ratios, making Trinamool campaign managers hopeful of reaping the “gender dividend” of the party’s “Bangla Nijer Meyekei Chay” campaign focusing on CM Mamata Banerjee. Another critical sub-plot — the defection saga — has played out in many of these seats, making net-gainer BJP optimistic about its chances. Banerjee’s key aides in the anti-land acquisition stir in Singur, Rabindranath Bhattacharya and Becharam Manna, are now pitted against each other; the BJP led the Trinamool in Singur in 2019. The Trinamool was number two in several other Hooghly seats like Serampore, Chinsurah, Balagarh, Pandua and Saptagram. Howrah follows a somewhat similar trajectory. Another prominent Trinamool rebel, Rajib Banerjee, seeks re-election from Domjur. This constituency, however, has a minority voting population of around 40%, making the former cabinet minister focus on his “development work” rather than the aggressive Hindutva line followed by the likes of Suvendu Adhikari. BJP votes surged in Howrah in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls; the Trinamool scraped through in Bally by a mere 295 votes and lost Howrah (North). The BJP approximated the 40% vote-share mark in Shibpur, Howrah (Central) and Howrah (South) as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/battle-for-bengals-soul-enters-urban-heartland/articleshow/81996771.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal violence spirals ahead of phase 4||TAMLUK: Spiralling violence and tension was reported from several parts of Bengal, including Howrah and Cooch Behar, that go to polls in the fourth phase on Saturday. Nandigram too remained on edge after Trinamool Congress worker Rabindranath Manna succumbed to his injuries at SSKM Hospital in Kolkata. Manna was injured on March 27; three days later, CM Mamata Banerjee had visited his home to meet his wife and children. On Thursday night, Trinamool’s Mathabhanga candidate Girindranath Barman was attacked and left injured. The FIR implicates BJP supporters. Barman was visiting the house of a supporter, who was roughed up allegedly by BJP men. While returning, the candidate’s vehicle was intercepted at Sildanga godown area and vandalized. In Cooch Behar, Trinamool leader Partha Pratim Roy staged a dharna in front of the Mathabhanga SDO office, demanding arrest of those involved in the attack. BJP co-convenor Indrajit Debnath said his party activists were not involved in the incident. In Nandigram, on Friday morning, Manna’s body was brought home to Balarampur village, where Trinamool leaders and workers rallied in large numbers. A strong posse of police force was also deployed. Manna was attacked while returning from Nandigram police station after complaining that his house had been razed by BJP supporters. Balarampur is in Boyal II panchayat, which was rocked by sporadic violence. Trinamool’s East Midnapore president Soumen Mahapatra rushed to the site. “He was killed as he openly said he would vote for Mamata Banerjee,” he said.  BJP’s Tamluk organisational vice-president Pralay Pal said: “I convey my condolences. But none from BJP is involved in his death.” Also on Thursday, BJP’s south Howrah candidate Rantideb Sengupta was reportedly attacked at Nazirgunj Hanskhali pole.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-violence-spirals-ahead-of-phase-4/articleshow/81995942.cms||---
