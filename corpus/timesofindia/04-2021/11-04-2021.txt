Scores of employees at Faisalabad Civil Hospital in central Punjab staged a protest on Friday against the Christian nurses, identified as Mariyum Lal and Newsh Arooj, while alleging that both had committed blasphemy. Among the protesters were clerics demanding strict punishment to the duo. Sources said Lal and Arooj had been directed by a senior, Rukhsana, to remove old wall hangings and stickers from the psychiatric ward. Rukhsana, according to the sources, held a grudge against Lal and allegedly provoked other Muslim staffers at the hospital by claiming that wall hangings bearing Quranic verses had been desecrated. A pharmacy worker identified as Waqas subsequently attacked Lal with a knife just as she was attending to a patient in the hospital’s medical ward. She survived the attack with minor injuries to her arm. The blasphemy allegation against the nurses soon spread to the broader community and a mob staged a protest outside the hospital. Some in the crowd demanded that Lal be arrested and hanged for blasphemy. The hospital administration called the police, who immediately took the nurse into protective custody so that she could be moved to a safer place. Scores of people tried to get hold of her but police kept her inside the van. Some of the rowdy agitators even attacked the police van parked inside the hospital. The police later registered an FIR in connection with the blasphemy allegation against the two nurses. In Pakistan, false accusations of blasphemy are common and often motivated by personal vendetta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/2-pak-christian-nurses-face-blasphemy-case-mob-bays-for-duos-blood/articleshow/82009779.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

After months of stringent rules, when cases started reducing a few months ago, people forgot that we are still in the midst of pandemic, and began flouting norms Passengers occupying middle seats on planes without wearing PPE kit, people going out without masks, violation of social distancing in markets and restaurants– these are frequently-seen sights now, despite the ongoing pandemic and the rising cases. Experts point out that as the second wave of coronavirus is on us, a new problem has emerged – COVID fatigue or COVID Avoidance Behaviour Syndrome. People have thrown caution to wind, under the false impression that the pandemic is nearing its end, which doctors say is a grave concern. Even as cases go up, the Delhi Metro – which did not need to fine even one person on Day 1 of restarting of Metro services post lockdown – is now imposing fines on hundreds of commuters daily. The Delhi Police, which was issuing 40-50 challans against violators in November, is now issuing challans to more 1,000 people every day. With people refusing to follow rules and cases going up, states have begun imposing new restrictions. We spoke to experts on behavioural issues that are causing the second wave. Doctors find the trend of ‘living life as nothing has happened’ terrifying ‘Despite rising COVID cases, people are continuing to live as if nothing has happened’Doctors find the trend of ‘living life as nothing has happened’ terrifying and say that we are in a very serious situation. Dr Arvind Kumar, Chairman, Institute of Chest Surgery, Medanta Hospital, Gurugram, stresses that people need to follow four cardinal principles: Wear masks, maintain social distancing, don’t gather in enclosed spaces and follow hand hygiene. People are not wearing masks in malls as well (picture for representational purposes only)He adds, “The present situation is self-created. The saddest part is that despite the cases rising rapidly in the last three weeks, people are continuing to live as if nothing has happened. I know so many people who started organising parties. The unfortunate thing is that when number of cases starts decreasing, the rate of transmission also starts decreasing and when it goes up, the rate of transmission also starts increasing.” Dr Kumar points out that the reason why we are facing a second wave of corona is because the decline in cases in last few months gave a false sense of normalcy to people, which led them to say goodbye to masks and social distancing. “The corona infection was always there in the community even two months back when we had started relaxing, thinking that it is gone now. The cases had started decreasing, but it had not disappeared. The reason it had started decreasing was because of the stringent measures that were taken wherein the chain of transmission was broken because of people wearing masks, maintaining social distance and following hand hygiene. And people were not gathering in large closed spaces like malls, cinema halls, gymnasiums, going for birthday parties and marriage celebrations. COVID safety measures were being followed very stringently in the months of September-December, which led to the decline in number of cases. However, that decline in number of cases led to complacency and a false sense of normalcy, which was also reflected in the behaviour of political leaders who started holding rallies, having mass congregations, which were not happening earlier. And thereby people got the message that corona toh ab chala gaya.” ‘Getting vaccine doesn’t mean the pandemic is over’Dr Vikas Maurya, Director and Head of Department, Pulmonology, Fortis Hospital Shalimar Bagh, reiterates the fact that people should not forget that we are still amid a pandemic. He says, “A lot of people think that the pandemic has ended because of the vaccine. This is not true. We still need to be vigilant; we still need to be careful. We cannot stop maintaining social distancing, wearing masks and following hand hygiene. It is imperative that we follow this. We should continue working from home for the foreseeable future. Many feel that the pandemic is nearing an end, when actually this is not true.” Dr Arvind Kumar adds, “We are now witnessing a serious second wave in the country. As far as the vaccine is concerned, one dose of it does not mean that you are protected. Second dose also does not mean you are protected.It is two weeks after the second dose that you are 70% protected, which is a huge protection. But 30% of people may still get it. It is not a 100% protection” One dose of vaccine does not mean that you are protected‘People are suffering from COVID Behavioural Fatigue Syndrome’Dr Anupam Sibal, Group Medical Director and Senior Pediatrician, Apollo Hospitals Group, points out that since it’s been over 450 days that we have been living with COVID, it is understandable that people are tired of behaving the way they are expected to behave. Dr Anupam Sibal shares that people have started forgetting that we are still amid the pandemic “I think what we have is a new condition: COVID Behavioural Fatigue Syndrome. In this syndrome, people forget that we are still in the middle of a pandemic. Masks are not worn at all or are worn improperly, social distancing is forgotten and hand washing is given a miss. A lot of young people also feel that since COVID doesn’t always produce serious manifestations, there is no need to create a fuss. They forget that while they might not have serious complications, their parents / grandparents can. Therefore, they should be extra careful,” he shares.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/covid-behavioural-fatigue-syndrome-false-sense-of-normalcy-goodbye-to-social-distancing-are-leading-to-surge-doctors/articleshow/82007411.cms||Riya Sharma

Sources who attended said it is likely that a 15-day lockdown will be implemented but a final decision will be taken after a series of meetings to be held on Sunday and Monday, in which a detailed plan will be worked out. Senior officials said it is likely that all the curbs being observed in the current weekend lockdown may be extended to weekdays. The lockdown will not be as stringent as it was last year, but only food manufacturing units along with medical diagnostics kits, pharmaceutical industries and their supply chains may be allowed to operate. “Initially, too, only industries associated with essentials were allowed to operate. A similar restriction may be imposed this time as well,” said sources. Read our coronavirus live blog for all the latest news and updatesWhile a Covid task force meeting is likely on Sunday, deputy CM Ajit Pawar will call for a meeting to plan the relief measures on Monday. It is likely that an official announcement will be made on Monday or Tuesday.

We have already increased the capacity of the six existing jumbo centres by adding regular and ICU beds,” said Sanjeev Jaiswal, BMC additional civicAll the alliance partners have supported the decision and opposition leaders have asked the government to announce a relief package for all those who will be impacted. The meeting on Saturday was held to arrive at a consensus on a lockdown in the state. Thackeray said there is no option but to go in for stricter curbs. “The number of patients is increasing so fast that if we do not decide on a lockdown today, a lockdown-like situation will automatically arise tomorrow,” said Thackeray. Read AlsoMaharashtra: Dip in Covid positive cases on day one of weekend lockdownOn the first day of the weekend lockdown on Saturday, the state not only registered a slight dip in positive Covid-19 detections but got an assurance from the Centre about additional ventilators and funds to hire additional healthcare workers to combat the second wave of the pandemic.“This is a health emergency and so priority should be given to the lives of the people. The situation is grim and we have to impose strict restrictions to slow down the spread,” said Thackeray. Senior officials said while the current restrictions will continue, unchecked daytime movement on weekdays may be restricted too. Currently, there is only a prohibitory order which does not allow assembly of more than five people during the day, though movement is unrestricted. He said the government is likely to continue with public transport such as trains, autos and buses for essential workers and for the general public for essential activities and emergencies. “There are nearly 60,000 people who head out to vaccination centres in Mumbai every day. There will be students going out for exams. Public transport will continue for all those who have a valid reason to step out,” said the official. Also, long-distance trains will continue to run so that no one is stuck and there is no panic. Opposition leaders said the government should come up with a comprehensive plan before any more restrictions are added. They also said relief measures and monetary packages for migrants, traders and daily-wage workers should be announced. Subsidised foodgrains should be made available for all those who will be impacted. “While imposing more restrictions, the government should also take into account public sentiment. Relief must be extended to small traders, retailers and salon owners whose business is also impacted,” said Devendra Fadnavis, leader of the opposition. Fadnavis further said medicines, oxygen supply and health infrastructure should be ramped up not only in the cities, but in rural areas as well. “We are all concerned about the poor and the working class. We will think about their problems too, but at the moment we need to stop the rapid spread. If we have to win this fight, we all have to go through some hardships,” said Thackeray. Senior officials said Thackeray had pointed out the infrastructure available today will prove to be inadequate in the next few days. Also, demand for oxygen too has gone up considerably and the state may soon run out. As on Friday, 960 metric tonne oxygen was used in the state as against the production of 1,200MT. “There was a debate regarding whether a seven-day lockdown suffice, but health officials were of the opinion that at least a 15-day lockdown is required to have the desired impact,” said a senior official.

Worryingly, it is these ground-level reports that the National AEFI Committee depends on to do causal assessments. "The committee has to give guidance to the health authorities at the district level what to look for. They need to be told how to conduct a pathological autopsy. This is not a post-mortem to detect a crime. You will find something only if you are told what to look for," said Dr Amar Jesani, editor of the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics. Read our coronavirus live blog for all the latest news and updates"The National Committee is depending on evidence and investigations conducted at the local level. However, we observed a strong tendency by local authorities to immediately rule out any links to vaccination, even before investigation has been conducted. In many cases, post-mortems have not been conducted — for example in at least six out of 10 cases where the National AEFI Committee has completed causality assessment, no post-mortem had been done. There is an urgent need to strengthen AEFI investigation at the local level where protocols may not be adhered to and the quality of evidence being collected is often weak and inadequate," said Malini Aisola, a public health activist who has been tracking AEFI events.

"By recognising the signs of bloods clots and low blood platelets and treating them early, healthcare professionals can help those affected in their recovery and avoid complications," stated the safety committee of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Yet in India, many who suffer serious AEFI, especially in rural areas, are left to fend for themselves, running from one hospital to another seeking medical treatment.

Many didn’t get any even after traveling long distances to the city for medical care. While the EU and the UK are reviewing AEFI cases at great speed and have concluded their investigation into the occurrence of blood clots post-vaccination, in India, the health ministry has announced that its review of 700 severe and serious AEFI in light of the findings abroad will be available by this weekend. In the meantime, EMA’s safety committee is already looking into whether yet another AEFI, capillary leak syndrome, was related to the AstraZeneca vaccine as five cases of this rare disorder characterised by leakage of blood causing tissue swelling and a drop in blood pressure were reported in the EuroVigilance database. "Unless health workers and district medical officers are trained on what constitutes AEFI and told what to look out for, how will they pick up AEFI cases or offer effective treatment for the adverse events? So many lives could be saved in Europe because they have gone into what needs to be done.

---||India||India only 2nd country to top 1.5 lakh Covid-19 cases in a day||India recorded more than 1.5 lakh fresh Covid-19 infections on Saturday, becoming the second country after the US to register the grim milestone on the back of a sharp uptick in cases from the Hindi heartland, particularly Chhattisgarh, UP and Bihar. There were 1,52,879 new cases recorded across the country, up more than 5% from Friday's count of 1.45 lakh. The 1.5 lakh count was crossed just six days after daily cases went past the 1-lakh mark, a 50% rise in less than a week. The peak count during the first wave of infections was 98,795, recorded on September 17, as per TOI’s corona database. Deaths also climbed to 839 on Saturday, the highest daily toll since October 16 last year. Although deaths have been rising steadily during the second wave, the toll continues to be low compared with the case fatality rates seen during the peak of the first wave in the country. Active cases crossed 1.1 million on Saturday with a daily addition of over 60,000 for the fourth day in a row. While Maharashtra has been the worst hit by the second Covid wave and continues to lead the count of daily cases by a wide margin, the rest of India has seen a much sharper surge in infections in the past two weeks, particularly after Holi. Maharashtra’s share in the daily national case count has dropped from the peak of 65% on March 18 to 36.4% on April 9. Maharashtra on Saturday reported 55,411 fresh cases and 309 deaths. Meanwhile, Chhattisgarh reported 14,098 new infections, up from 11,447 on the previous day, while deaths climbed to 123 from 91 on Friday. Uttar Pradesh saw a similar surge as detected infections rose to 12,787, from 9,695 on the earlier day, while 48 deaths were recorded. Bihar logged 3,469 cases, the highest since August 15. Among other states that recorded their highest ever daily counts were Gujarat (5,011) Madhya Pradesh (4,986) and Rajasthan (4,401).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-only-2nd-country-to-top-1-5l-cases-in-a-day/articleshow/82010090.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

Agreeing to hear a contempt petition, a bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Vineet Saran issued notices to the two officials seeking response on the allegation of violation of its order. Advocate Kumar Parimal, appearing for petitioner, brought to the court’s notice its earlier order when it had turned down the government’s plea to allow it to promote the officers during the pendency of the case. “It’s clear that the contemnors have deliberately, wilfully and dishonestly disobeyed the court’s order. It amounts to civil contempt and the alleged contemnors are required to be punished,” the petition said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-notice-to-dopt-secy-over-promotion-of-149-officers/articleshow/82010139.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||India||A peek into how new Rajpath buildings will look||NEW DELHI: The new office buildings that will come up and replace the existing ones along the Rajpath will get an identical and swanky look. The tenders for the first three such buildings with more facilities will be out next week as the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has received the go ahead from the Delhi Urban Art Commission (DUAC) and the Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC), sources said. The three buildings, which will be built on the plot where IGNCA is currently located, would involve an expenditure of around Rs 3,200 crore, TOI has learnt. These buildings will have big entry and exit gates, and the porches will be long and spacious enough to accommodate over a dozen cars at one time. The government has not yet finalised the names for these future buildings which will fall under Common Central Secretariat (CCS), though sources said each building would get a name. “Proper study has been carried out to assess how many people and vehicles enter and leave the existing office complexes daily. The entry and exit points in the future buildings have been planned to meet those requirements,” said a source. He added that estimates suggest the number of people commuting by Metro Rail to reach these office buildings may increase to 50% compared to the current 40%. Therefore, a robust underground transit facility for office goers has been planned, which will link all the buildings that will come up along the Rajpath. “There will be adequate security arrangements to check the identity of office goers and for frisking before they enter the buildings from the basements,” said a source. The office space will be created to meet more modern and IT requirements and there will be a uniform norm while creating the workstations. For example, all rooms of joint secretaries will be of one standard unlike the current norms, said a source. “The focus of creating such office space is to help increase the efficiency of workers by provisioning the required facilities,” said another official. TOI on January 1 had reported how these buildings in the Common Central Secretariat will have space for yoga, gymnasium, creche, pharmacy and first-aid centre. The government has also prepared a roadmap for improving the geometrics of all roundabouts and roads leading to the Rajpath and the office buildings to meet the future traffic demand. Currently, 30 ministries are housed on the Central Vista while around 27 ministries have offices outside the Vista. The plan is to bring all the 50 plus ministries at one location.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/a-peek-into-how-new-rajpath-buildings-will-look/articleshow/82010202.cms||Dipak K Dash

I don’t know the government’s plan. I’m consulting my lawyers. If the government initiates a departmental probe, I will act as per the advice of my lawyers,” Singh told TOI. Singh had written to the chief minister saying home minister Anil Deshmukh has asked API Sachin Waze to mobilise Rs 100 crore per month from hotels, restaurants and bars in Mumbai. Meanwhile, before relinquishing the charge, Deshmukh on April 1 approved a proposal for conducting a preliminary probe against Singh for breach of all-India service rules. The task of conducting the preliminary probe was entrusted to DGP Sanjay Pandey, who has been told to submit the report as early as possible. Deputy secretary (home) Kailash Gaikwad wrote a two-page letter to Pandey on the terms of reference. Pandey will have to examine if there was dereliction of duty by Singh while controlling and supervising his subordinates. It has been stated in Gaikwad’s letter that after Waze was reinstated, he was given charge of crime intelligence unit, despite opposition of the then joint commissioner (crime) and that Waze was reporting directly to the CP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/will-approach-court-if-govt-orders-dept-probe-param-bir-singh/articleshow/82010308.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||India||Sachin Waze took Rs 30 lakh from BARC in TRP scam: ED||MUMBAI: Enforcement Directorate (ED) investigations into money laundering in the Television Rating Points (TRP) manipulation scam has thrown up a Sachin Waze link. Officials found the now-suspended assistant inspector, through an inspector of the Mumbai crime branch, had extorted Rs 30 lakh from Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) for not harassing its executives. BARC officials have given statements on the bribe payment to Waze, said a source. BARC had reportedly shown in its books that it had awarded some construction-related work on its premises and then transferred the money to the account of a dummy company.

This agreement will be terminated on July 30. After BARC made the payment to the account of a dummy company, it was layered through four more shell companies. It was then transferred to a hawala operator’s bank account, showing fictitious transactions. The sum was returned in cash to BARC, which was then handed over to Waze’s associate, an inspector. The ED recorded the statement of a BARC employee and senior company executives, who reportedly confirmed it. But the ED is yet to question the crime branch inspector and Waze.

Hansa filed a police case last year, accusing its employee of manipulating TRP by paying money to households. Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh had assigned the investigation to the central intelligence unit (CIU) under Waze. Subsequently, the ED registered a money laundering case based on a Mumbai police FIR. A source stated that Waze had been calling BARC executives along with officials of other companies associated with the case for questioning at his office on the premises of Mumbai police commissionerate headquarters in South Mumbai. The source said, “Waze used to tell BARC executives to wait outside his office for hours, even late in the evening, and then telling them to come the next day. Waze also created an impression that he beats up suspects during questioning and asked BARC to pay a Rs 30 lakh bribe if they want to avoid torture.” Read AlsoAnil Deshmukh demanded Rs 2 crore; asked me to extort money from bars, restaurants: Sachin Waze in letterWaze's revelations come just days after former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh also levelled corruption allegations against Deshmukh, for which he is facing a CBI inquiry.

The ED will soon file its first chargesheet in the TRP laundering case. Recently, the ED attached properties worth Rs 32 crore of Fakt Marathi, Box Cinema and Maha Movies channels in the case for generating advertising revenue through manipulated TRP. Box Cinema and Maha Movies had generated 25 % of their TRP in Mumbai with the help of five houses where the barometers were installed. Fakt Marathi had generated 12% of its TRP from the same number of houses. Officials stated that TRP was calculated on the basis of total time spent on a channel, and not according to number of households.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/waze-took-rs-30-lakh-from-barc-in-trp-scam-ed/articleshow/82010328.cms||Vijay V Singh

Almost 66% children lack desired aerobic capacity and 33% had poor anaerobic capacity, the survey finds. Conducted in the academic year 2020, the survey covered 2,54,681 children in the age group of 7 to 17 years from 364 schools – both private and government -- across 250 cities and towns. One in six, or 16%, children didn’t have the desired upper abdominal or core strength and 50% children lacked upper body strength. Despite being young, 33% of the children were not adequately flexible. And 66% of children didn’t have enough lower body strength. The survey conducted by Sportz Village (earlier known as Edu Sports) also highlighted gender-specific trends. For example, girls fared better than boys in BMI, flexibility and upper body strength but boys scored better than girls in aerobic capacity and lower body strength. The survey further revealed that private school children scored higher than those in government schools when it came to BMI levels. Forty-six percent children in private schools had a healthy BMI as compared to 42% in government schools. But 75% of children in government schools had good anaerobic capacity, which means they were good at doing activities that need sudden burst of energy, like sprinting and jumping. Private school children did well in tests to determine upper body strength, 43% of them all were found to have adequate upper body strength. School children from north India were found to be healthier than children from the rest of the country with best numbers in the parameters of BMI and aerobic Capacity, and above average numbers in the parameters of flexibility, upper body strength, lower body strength and core strength. However, they performed very poorly in anaerobic capacity. In the south, school children showed above average performance in BMI and anaerobic capacity. Children in eastern India scored well in flexibility, core strength and anaerobic capacity but fared poorly on BMI. More than half the children in western India have good upper body strength and 80% had above average core strength. However, their BMI levels and anaerobic capacity were found to be average. This was the 11th edition of the Sportz Villages’ annual health survey. And according to its CEO and Founder Saumil Majmudar, the survey has consistently been showing poor fitness levels in children. He blames it on a number of factors, like sedentary lifestyle and lack of focus on sports in schools. “While junk food does lead to health issues, the real problem is ‘junk lifestyle’ which does not include daily activity and play. Lack of access to open and safe play spaces also impacts the fitness levels of children. Apart from lack of access, there is also a related issue of aggregation i.e. children like to play when other children like them (skill/fitness/mindset) are also coming to play. Just getting one child access to an empty playground with some sports equipment doesn’t work,” said Majmudar. He also emphasised the importance of introducing structured play at school which is inclusive and age appropriate. From their experience of introducing structured sports curriculum in schools Sportz Village found that it led to a 5% increase in school attendance and improved attention spans and peer-to-peer relationships.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/1-in-2-school-children-dont-have-healthy-bmi/articleshow/82008353.cms||Shobita Dhar
---||India||Citing Covid, Tomar asks farmers to call off their stir, come for talks||NEW DELHI: Amid uncertainty over the fate of farm laws due to stay on implementation by the Supreme Court, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Saturday cited the spurt in Covid infections and renewed his appeal to farmer unions to call off their agitation for repeal of the laws, saying the “government is ready for talks” on all contentious issues to find a solution. Tomar suggested the unions have been inconsistent in their statements, saying “Sabere kuch, sham me kuchh (something in the morning while something else in the evening)”. He also pointed to the current surge in Covid cases to ask the farmers to follow safety protocols, saying their lives were precious to the nation. The minister's remarks come in the backdrop of the unions’ plan to intensify their agitation this month despite a second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Besides holding various protest programmes in next two weeks, the farmer unions have also planned to start a week-long programme on completion of 150 days of their movement at Delhi borders on April 24, taking support of various labour and students organisations from across the country. “Now we are facing the second wave of pandemic. The entire nation and the world is following Covid-19 protocols. Even protesting farmers should follow the protocols. Their life is important for us,” said Tomar in his video message, released by his office. He also pointed out how the farmers' sit-in protest at Delhi border made the lives of ordinary citizens difficult. Referring to 11th round of talks held on January 22, Tomar said the government had made an offer to put implementation of the farm laws on hold for 18 months and constitute a committee for making suggestions on all issues including minimum support price (MSP), but the farmer unions rejected it without citing any reason. “We had told farm unions to come up with their own proposal and we were ready for discussion on that also…Ours is a democratic country, if anyone, be it farmers or citizens, has any doubt, the government believes it is its responsibility to clear those doubts and find a solution,” said the minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/citing-covid-tomar-asks-farmers-to-call-off-their-stir-come-for-talks/articleshow/82010430.cms||Vishwa Mohan

He was also fined Rs 15,000, of which Rs 10,000 will be given to the girl at the end of the appeal period. The child told the court that on February 29 last year, when she was out with her sister, the accused, who lived in her neighbourhood, winked at her and blew flying kisses at her. The child said that earlier, too, the accused had committed similar acts. In her cross-examination by the defence, she denied the suggestion that there was a bet for Rs 500 between her cousin and the accused over his pursuing her. The child’s mother, in her deposition, said that she complained to her about the accused’s behaviour, adding that she confronted him and then went to the police after which he was arrested. The defence advocate submitted that the acts described by the child and mother could not be termed as those committed with any sexual intention. The defence claimed that a proper investigation was not carried out. The court concluded that there was no evidence to show that the witnesses had any reason to falsely implicate the accused. “Moreover, there is consistent evidence that accused was confronted after the incident. If the evidence on record is perused, then the acts of the accused of winking and giving flying kisses constitute a sexual gesture, thereby causing sexual harassment to the victim,” the court said. The defence advocate submitted that the acts described by the child and mother could not be termed as those committed with any sexual intention. The defence claimed that a proper investigation was not carried out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mans-winking-flying-kisses-at-teen-get-him-ri/articleshow/82010640.cms||---

A 14-year-old boy was among several injured in the seven rounds of firing by CISF that left four villagers died. The Election Commission countermanded polling in booth number 126 of the constituency, based on a report from special observer Vivek Dube. The first victim of Saturday’s violence was 18-year-old Ananda Burman, who was shot by two bike-borne assailants just as he stepped out of a polling booth after casting the first vote of his life. Cooch Behar SP Debasish Dhar said Burman died before he could be taken to hospital. Trinamool and BJP blamed each other for the death, which occurred around 9am and seemed to set the tone for the rest of the day. Two people were arrested in connection with the attack while the EC sought a report on the incident. Trouble started 45 minutes later at Amtali Madhyamaik Shiksha Kendra, about 15km away, after 14-year-old Md Manik collapsed near a polling booth. Villagers said his mother had asked him to wait outside before stepping in to vote. Three women from the neighbourhood were trying to revive Manik when CISF personnel guarding the booth stepped out to check what the commotion was about. The CISF team offered to shift the boy to a hospital, reports reaching the EC office in Kolkata suggested. But, according to another account based on what a section of villagers said, Manik was injured in an assault by the CISF personnel. Around 350 people gathered in no time and attacked the CISF team and others, including unit head Sunil Kumar, a 32-year-old home guard, two poll officers and an Asha worker, sources said. The mob reportedly tried to snatch firearms from the CISF personnel. A quick-response team headed for the site was apparently waylaid by residents of the area and their vehicle ransacked. According to officials, the CISF personnel fired two rounds in the air at first, but that failed to disperse the crowd. They then fired seven rounds in “self-defence”, leading to the deaths. “Primary investigation revealed the force opened fire in self-defence after a few from the mob tried to snatch their firearms,” DIG (Jalpaiguri range) E Annapa said. SP Dhar corroborated what Annapa said. “They (the CISF men) were overpowered and fired in self-defence.” Reports sent to the EC, too, cited “self-defence” as the reason for the firing. But a report released by the BSF inspector-general (south Bengal) and CAPF nodal officer for Bengal A K Singh contradicted that version. This report, shared with the media, said firing took place twice — first when 50-60 people attacked a CISF patrol “taking a round of the area along with local police representatives to clear people who were resisting voters from reaching polling booths”. “One child fell in the melee and miscreants started damaging the unit vehicle and attacked personnel. The team reacted in self-defence and fired six rounds in the air to disperse the mob,” the report said. The BSF report suggested that the police, too, fired at the mob. SP Dhar denied any firing by the cops. The second incident took place around 10.30am. Around 150 people returned to attack booth number 126, assaulted poll officials and CISF personnel and tried to snatch their firearms, the report said. Security forces initially fired two rounds in the air and, after that, seven more rounds at the advancing mob. The dead were identified as Chhalmu Mia, Jobed Ali, Amzad Hossain and Nameed Mia. In Kolkata, crude bombs were hurled at a housing complex and chilli powder sprayed on polling agents in a daylong cycle of disruption, especially in the southern localities of Kasba and Jadavpur. Residents of the Rose Valley Apartments at Kustia in Tiljala said they were left pulverised by two bombs lobbed from the rear of the complex around 1.30pm, minutes before a few residents were to assemble to cast their votes at a nearby primary health centre. “Kids would be playing here on any other day. Today being an election day, we had asked them to stay inside,” said Sharad Agarwal, a resident of the complex. At a booth near Jadavpur, two elderly women polling agents needed medical attention after their eyes were sprayed with chilli powder by an alleged false voter. Both Dipti Lahiri (71), a CPM polling agent, and Sunanda Das (64), representing an Independent candidate, stood their ground in the face of the attack. BJP alleged that its agent at Shahid Smriti Colony was assaulted and barred from the booth. Similar charges of assault on two BJP workers were levelled by the party’s Jadavpur candidate Rinku Naskar in the Kendua area. At Kasba, another south Kolkata locality, BJP alleged that Trinamool workers targeted specific apartments and snatched voter ID cards. Trinamool contested the allegation. Two-time Dinhata MLA Udayan Guha was allegedly attacked by BJP supporters when he was stepping out of a booth in the Bhataguri area. In Hooghly, actor-MP and BJP candidate Locket Chatterjee’s car was attacked by a group carrying black flags. She alleged that the attack was in retaliation to her bid to stop rigging attempts at a booth. Actor and BJP’s Behala candidate Payel Sarkar’s car was vandalised allegedly by Trinamool supporters when she was visiting booths in the area. Vaishali Dalmiya, the BJP candidate from Bally, was also attacked and a car in her convoy was vandalised, allegedly by Trinamool workers, when she was visiting booths at Liluah. Trinamool pointed fingers at dissension in BJP for the violence.

---||India||EC bans entry of politicians for 72 hours in violence-hit district of Bengal||NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Saturday, in an unprecedented order, barred the entry of leaders of all political parties in the geographical limits of Cooch Behar district for the next 72 hours citing ‘law and order’ concerns and also extended the ‘silence period’ for the next phase of polling in West Bengal, due on April 17, to 72 hours from 48 hours. The EC direction, issued by invoking the commission’s plenary powers under Article 324 of the Constitution, came hours after Sitalkuchi, one of the nine assembly constituencies that constitute Cooch Behar district, witnessed firing by CISF personnel on a violent mob during polling on Saturday, which left four people dead. The EC decision seemed to have been taken to prevent political parties and leaders whipping up emotions in the area. Even though polls are over in the district, the possible repercussions for remaining phases have been kept in mind. The poll panel on Saturday asked the state chief secretary and DGP, as also district magistrate and SP of Cooch Behar, to take all steps, including making visits themselves, deputing senior officers and sending reinforcements of central/state forces to ensure compliance of EC directions “in letter as well as in spirit”. Special observers Ajay Nayak and Vivek Dube as well as West Bengal chief electoral officers have been asked to keep the EC informed about the developments in Cooch Behar over the next 72 hours. Justifying its decision to keep politicians of all national, state or other parties out of Cooch Behar district for 72 hours with immediate effect, the EC said it had learnt that last rites of those killed in the firing were not yet completed and that some political leaders were likely to visit the area with the ostensible purpose of condoling the bereaved families. This the EC said, has the “portent to cause a law and order problem of major proportions in this place as well as the adjoining places”. The EC itself will see a change of guard after the next round of polling with Sunil Arora retiring and Sushil Chandra taking over. The poll panel said since the firing happened in a confrontation with CISF, “the chances of central forces deployed in this area becoming or being made the butt of further grave provocation by groups of people cannot also be ruled out”. Campaign in constituencies going to polls in the fifth phase will end 24 hours earlier than what is mandated under Section 126 of the R P Act. The EC had similarly cut short campaigning in Bengal during the last phase of Lok Sabha poll 2019 over repeated incidents of violence. Citing the joint report of its two special observers Ajay Nayak and Vivek Dube received at 5.12pm on the Sitalkuchi incident, the EC said they had inter alia stated “that recourse to open fire by CISF personnel became absolutely necessary in order to save the lives of the voters lined up at the polling booth, those of other polling personnel and their own lives as the mob had attempted snatching their weapons”. This was further corroborated by Cooch Behar SP Debashish Dhar, who in a byte to electronic media on Saturday, stated that the firing by CISF was purely in self-defence. Sources told TOI that the reports with EC say the mob had come “fully prepared” to unleash violence in Sitalkuchi polling station and possibly attack the poll staff and central forces personnel. “A mob of nearly 150 people stormed the polling station, armed with lathis and sharp-edged weapons, etc. They beat up and heckled polling staff, ASHA workers and tried to snatch the weapons from CISF personnel on duty. The CISF personnel initially fired warning shots in the air, but after the mob refused to back off and posed an imminent threat to the polling staff and even voters, 6-7 rounds were fired in defence,” a CISF officer told TOI. The EC, based on the report of the district general and police observers, ordered adjournment of polling in the concerned polling station. The poll panel in its order barring entry of politicians in Cooch Behar, cited the SC judgement of 1984 that said the presumption of ECI as regards law and order situation in the areas going to polls should prevail over that of state government and that even the high court should not substitute its knowledge and opinion in such matters. It also said SC had held in 1978 that Article 324 of the Constitution is a reservoir of power for EC to act in such vacuous area where the enacted laws make no provisions or make ‘insufficient provisions’ to deal with the situation relating to conduct of elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ec-bans-entry-of-politicians-for-72-hours-in-violence-hit-district-of-bengal/articleshow/82010786.cms||Bharti Jain
---||India||Prashant Kishor audio clip creates social media furore||NEW DELHI: An audio snippet of Trinamool Congress strategist Prashant Kishor, where he talks about PM Narendra Modi's popularity in Bengal and of Trinamool's own surveys indicating a voter preference for BJP, among other things, created a flurry on social media on Saturday with the saffron party latching onto the comments to claim Kishor had "conceded" defeat. The snippet was part of a chat between Kishor and some senior journalists about the ongoing West Bengal elections on Club House, an invite-only social media App available on iOS. “In a public chat on Club House, Mamata Banerjee’s election strategist concedes that even in TMC’s internal surveys, BJP is winning. The vote is for Modi, polarisation is a reality, the SCs (27% of WB’s population), Matuas are all voting for the BJP! BJP has cadre on ground,” Malviya wrote in his first tweet posted around 7.15am. ‘ClubHouse’ was the top trend in India around 2pm with over 45k tweets, followed by #PrashantKishor with nearly 11k posts. Kishor replied to Malviya claiming that the snippets were taken out of context. “I am glad BJP is taking my chat more seriously than words of their own leaders! They should show courage & share the full chat instead of getting excited with selective use of parts of it. I have said this before & repeating again - BJP will not CROSS 100 in WB. Period,” he posted around 10.30 am. In the audio clips, Kishor, whose Indian Political Action Committee (IPAC) has designed TMC’s electoral campaign, explains the factors favouring BJP. “If people are voting (for BJP), they are voting because of Modi. There are other factors like religious identity, polarisation, Hindi-speakers, scheduled caste (votes),” he says, adding that even in TMC’s internal surveys, respondents generally state that BJP is forming government. Malviya further tweeted, “Another candid admission by Mamata Banerjee’s election strategist - all that the Left, Congress and TMC ecosystem have done in the last 20 years is Muslim appeasement.” Kishor is quoted as saying that "Modi is hugely popular in Bengal and there is no doubt about it. There is a cult around him across the country”. “It’s 75-25 between BJP-TMC.” He says internal surveys of the party show that, “BJP is predominantly winning the polls as 10-15%, who are Left supporters, are also saying that BJP is winning”. At one point, a journalist asks Kishor who will vote for TMC and why he is confident that TMC is winning the election. To this, Kishor replies that he has said 50-55% Hindus will vote for BJP, but the audio abruptly stops there. In another audio clip, Kishor mentions the “blatant use of minority votes” by the Left, Congress and TMC over the last 20 years. AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi responded to this over a series of five tweets, in which he tore into the concept of “minority appeasement” mentioned by Kishor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/prashant-kishor-audio-clip-creates-social-media-furore/articleshow/82010821.cms||Anam Ajmal

Ashwini Kumar (52) was the SHO of the Kishanganj model police station. The incident took place around 3.30am when the SHO along with half a dozen police personnel had gone to nab the kingpin of a motorbike lifters’ gang. Some residents of Pantapara village under Panjipara police station in West Bengal engaged in a verbal duel and tried to stop the raiding team from entering the house of the gang leader. The SHO intervened when the complainant of a stolen motorbike, who was accompanying the raiding team, was pelted with stones and thrashed by the residents. The mob then turned on the SHO and beat him mercilessly. Other members of the Kishanganj police team managed to escape. IG (Purnia range) Suresh Prasad Choudhary and Kishanganj SP Ashish Anand contacted their counterparts in West Bengal, who sent a police team to the spot. The injured SHO was rushed to Islampur sub-divisional hospital where he was declared dead. IG Choudhary said three people, including Firoz Alam, stated to be involved in motorbike thefts, were taken in custody and brought to Kishanganj for interrogation. The deceased SHO, a resident of Panchu Tola in Purnia district, was posted in Kishanganj about a year ago.

Debbarman’s fledgling outfit, which had contested the polls under the banner of Tipraland State Party, bagged the lion’s share of the spoils with 16 seats to INPT’s two. BJP got nine seats and one went to an Independent, leaving the Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura, one-time powerhouse CPM and Congress with nothing to show. Elections to the 30-seat autonomous council had been held on April 6. Two seats are for nominees of the governor, based on the state government’s advice. Polling was originally scheduled for May 17 last year, but was postponed due to the pandemic. The BJP-led state government then pronounced governor’s rule by appointing a retired IAS officer as administrator for a period of six months. His term was extended by another six months from November 17. “The indigenous people of Tripura have been suffering from maladministration and vote-based politics of the Left and other national parties for the last 70 years. In the 2018 assembly elections, the indigenous people believed in IPFT as it had signed an agreement for socio-economic, cultural and linguistic development of tribals with BJP while forming an alliance. The people voted them to office, only to be let down,” Debbarman said. He predicted that the outcome of the tribal council polls would be repeated in the urban civic polls slated for later this year. While the former state Congress chief described his alliance’s victory as the manifestation of “unity among indigenous people and a united voice against misrule by the BJP-IPFT government”, BJP said the verdict would spur it to step up development activities in Tripura. INPT general secretary Jagadish Debbarma, who is among the winning candidates, said the BJP-IPFT government was riven by internal conflict and corruption. In the 2005 elections to the tribal council, the Left Front had won 24 out of 28 seats while INPT took four.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agartala/tripura-royal-scions-new-outfit-upstages-bjp-in-tribal-council-polls/articleshow/82010825.cms||Biswendu Bhattacharjee

The couple was all set to tie the knot on April 5 as the groom and his wedding party in traditional attire reached Kusaha village under Longay panchayat in the district. The bride, Basmati Murmu, was decked-up and ready to perform the wedding rituals. But, little did they know that their wedding ritual of offering liquor to their deity would land the 'pradhan' of the tribal hamlet in jail on charges of possessing alcohol in dry Bihar. A tribal wedding, according to custom, cannot be solemnised without the presence of the 'pradhan'. A police team reached the village before the wedding could begin and arrested the village headman allegedly for stocking liquor. The village chief, Gopal Soren, told the police that the homemade liquor was for offering prayers to god, but in vain. Villagers Madan Soren, Geet Lal Besra and Dinesh Murmu said the police didn't listen to them and took the 'pradhan' away. He was produced before a court, which remanded him in judicial custody. A delegation of the community met the sub-divisional officer and the block development officer besides senior police officers requesting them to release the village pradhan so that the wedding could be solemnised. "But nobody paid any heed to our repeated requests. Finally, we returned and called a meeting of the members of the community. It was decided that the bride will go with the bridegroom Arvind Mandal without a formal wedding," the bride's elder brother Dinesh Murmu said. The wedding party stayed at the village for two consecutive days in anticipation that the pradhan would be freed. "For how long, could we have borne the cost of their food and lodging?" the bride's brother said. He added, "We had no choice but to let her go to the bridegroom's house at Shobha village in Banka district without the wedding." Since then, the couple has been living together. Dinesh revealed that the marriage can't be solemnised in the absence of the 'pradhan'. "His presence is mandatory as per our tradition," he added. The police claimed that altogether 15 litres of liquor were seized from the village. The residents, however, rubbished the police claim and said only two to three litres of homemade liquor was there for use in the wedding rituals. Banka BDO Abhinav Bharti said he received a petition seeking the headman's release earlier this week. "Since the accused has been booked for violating the prohibition law, he will be released on bail from the competent court only," Bharti added. Some members of the tribal community said, according to their custom, a bride is declared a widow if the wedding party returns without completing the rituals. "Hence, the decision was taken to allow the bride to live with the groom without marriage to avoid embarrassment to both families," a senior member of the tribal community said. Another senior member of the community seeking anonymity said they have vowed not to repeat the same offence when the wedding rituals are held after the 'pradhan' comes out of jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/prohibition-law-disrupts-tribal-couples-wedding/articleshow/82009136.cms||Ramashankar

The stadium has been a home to cricket in the state since its foundation. It has been a nurturing ground for many talents over decades. In July 2018, the Bihar Cricket Association (BCA) had mooted a plan to redevelop the stadium with financial support from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). It also signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the state government for the purpose. Rakesh Kumar, special secretary in state building construction department, said groundwork and renovation of existing structures are in progress. “Roughly, 10-15% of total work has been completed till date. The remaining work will be completed by the end of 2022,” he said. As per the blueprint, the renovated stadium will have a swimming pool, broad-beamed floodlights, electronic score board, designated parking area, media house, gym, residential quarters, turf wicket ground, pavilion and modern indoor facilities. The project is targeted to be executed with an estimated expenditure of Rs 350-400 crore. The BCA office-bearers, however, said the progress in the project has been sluggish. BCA infrastructure incharge Patwardhan Kumar said the state government has turned a blind eye towards the current situation of the stadium. “The BCA has been working on the development of pitches to maintain steady flow of fixtures at the ground, but without the support from state government,” he added. President of Bihar Players’ Association Mrityunjay Tiwari said the state government has failed to provide opportunities to sportspersons. “The reconstruction of the stadium is yet to become a reality. The state government does not care about the sportspersons,” he said. Rajnish Kumar, a member of Bihar cricket team, said, “There has not been any major progress as far as reconstruction of the stadium is concerned. While the ground staff work on the pitch before fixtures, nothing much has been done to improve infrastructure at the stadium.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-moin-ul-haq-stadium-to-get-a-rs-400crore-facelift-by-end-of-2022/articleshow/82008964.cms||---

A BSPCB communique released on Saturday said a Suvidha Kendra set up at the Board headquarters on the Patliputra Industrial Area road will facilitate the filing of applications by entrepreneurs. It will become operational from April 15. Suvidha Kendras have also come up at Muzaffarpur and Barauni. The communique said the entrepreneurs will be able to file their applications, along with scanned documents, by paying a fee of Rs 1,000. The online facility aims to remove the delays in the issuance of environmental clearance to entrepreneurs for their projects. Under the manual system, the delay was often caused by errors made in filling the forms and documents, which delayed the process of issuing clearance certificate, the communique stated. For environmental clearance from the pollution control authority, a separate set of forms would have to be filled through the online process, coupled with the submission of scanned documents for a fee of Rs 1,000 would be charged. Once the forms and documents are submitted online, the applicants would be informed about the acceptance or rejection of their application over the phone after three days. Alternatively, if any other document is required, the applicants will also be similarly intimated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/online-system-to-speed-up-green-clearance-for-entrepreneurs/articleshow/82008752.cms||Abhay Singh

Spike in Covid cases has pushed the demand for a variety of medicines, thereby increasing number of daily visitors, traders and company representatives to G M Road. BSDA secretary Pradeep Kumar Chaurasia said there are about 48,000 large or small medicine shops in the state, including 4,000 in Patna alone. “Use of technology for placing order is safe and suited to the pandemic times,” he added. Secretary of Patna Chemists and Druggists Association Rajesh Kumar Arya said there was a huge demand for medicines like Remdesivir, which is mostly used for treatment of Covid patients. The demand for drugs like Azithromycin, Paracetamol, cough syrups, vitamin C and Chyavanprash has also increased, leading to rush at medicine shops on G M Road. Arya said banners and posters have been pasted on G M Road, urging the visitors to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/drug-dealers-body-calls-for-digital-trade/articleshow/82009100.cms||---

The Mahavir Temple Trust Committee, for instance, has once again started online bookings for religious rituals and offerings. Although the temple gates are shut, shops selling Naivedyam laddoos will remain open for the devotees. Priests and religious heads will also be allowed to carry out their rituals as usual. Trust secretary Kishore Kunal told this newspaper on Saturday, “Since Ram Navami is around the corner, we have decided to restart online bookings for ‘darshan’ which will cost up to Rs 500 each. We had suffered a financial loss of Rs 1.5 crore per month last year as donations, charities and sale of laddoos were hit.” The general secretary of the Takhat Sri Harmandir Ji Patna Sahib Prabandhak Committee, M S Dillon, said arrangements were made for a 48-hour online ‘Akhand Path’ for devotees. “One has to pay Rs 8,100 for the path,” he added. Dillon recalled that during the Covid-induced lockdown in 2020, online ‘path’ and ‘darshan’ were the main sources of income of the committee. Similarly, only the ‘imam’ (leads prayers), the ‘muezzin’ (proclaims the call to prayer) and three others will be permitted inside mosques. Maulana Shibli Al Quasmi, the general secretary of Islamic religious body Imarat-e-Shariah, claimed, “We will not be able to collect donations from devotees during the holy month of Ramzan. Hence, the salaries of the ‘imam’, ‘muezzin’ and other staff may get affected.” The Patna Archdiocese, on the other hand, has decided not to pay this month’s salary to those teaching in schools that fall under its jurisdiction. “The Patna Archdiocese manages 13 English-medium and seven Hindi-medium schools in Bihar. Due to the lockdown last year, we were forced to cut down the salaries of our teachers. With the closure of schools and churches again, we will not be able to pay this month’s salary to our staff,” vicar general Fr Prem Prakash SJ said, adding that most of their funds depended on charities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/places-of-worship-go-virtual-again/articleshow/82008922.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||Bihar: 123 fined for breach of Covid-19 norms||PATNA: State transport department on Saturday fined 123 private and public vehicle drivers and passengers for violating Covid safety guidelines. The state government issued fresh guidelines on Friday, allowing public transport to function with only 50% seating capacity in the wake of an alarming increase in the number of Covid-19 positive cases. However, some auto-rickshaw drivers rued that curbing the number of passengers will result in dire economic consequences for daily wage earners, reducing their per day income by half. "What used to be 12 rounds with 60 passengers on board, will now be 12 rounds with only 30 passengers," said Sunny Kumar, an auto-rickshaw driver plying between Hanuman Nagar and Patna Junction. Another auto-rickshaw driver, Sumant echoed, "The earnings will be consumed in fuel refill and vehicle maintenance and no personal savings will be gained this way." Meanwhile, an official of the Bihar State Road Transport Corporation (BSRTC) said all bus drivers and conductors are to ferry just the permissible number of passengers. "Use of masks by drivers and passengers is compulsory, alternate seating arrangements are also being strictly adhered to," he said. Rajeev Roshan, a city-based taxi operator, said he is now allowing only two office goers to carpool instead of four. "Passengers themselves have refused to travel with someone else. I have also put up transparent curtains, barricading the front seats from the back," he told this newspaper. Residents are also avoiding the use of public transport to reduce the risk of contracting the virus. Buddha Colony resident, Saket Singh said, "No matter what the guidelines instruct, nobody wears a mask. It’s safer not to use public transport in the present scenario." Since marketing professional Mehul Singh's company has shifted to the work-from-home mode again, he no longer requires public transport to commute. "With my office closed, I don’t need to move out of my home as all essential things can be bought online these days," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/123-fined-for-breach-of-covid-19-norms/articleshow/82008898.cms||---
---||Patna||Shops, small business establishments in Patna down shutters at 7pm||PATNA: Following new guidelines issued by the government amid rise in number of Covid cases in the city, shops and small business establishments have started taking precautionary measures again. As per the new guidelines, all shops and business establishments, except hotels, dhabas and restaurants should be closed by 7pm. In addition, shops have also been asked to ensure physical distancing. Goldie Amar, owner of a grocery shop at Kankarbagh, said like last year, he has barricaded the entrance of his shop. “People have to wait at the entrance to receive items,” he added. Shopping complexes in the city are also adhering to Covid-preventive norms. “Thermal screening and hand sanitisation at the entrance and use of mask have been made mandatory,” said Aditya, manager of a shopping complex at Rajendra Nagar. However, most shops and business owners have rued early deadline for closure of shops and businesses. Primesh Raj, executive of a popular supermarket in Bandar Bagicha, said, “People usually come to shops in the evening after their office time. The early closure order will affect our businesses.” Amar Yadav, staff at a supermarket in Kankarbagh, said, “I have been allotted the evening shift. However, with the market closing early in the evening, I am worried of losing my job again.” Salons and gym owners too have expressed concern over fresh restrictions imposed by the government. “Working professionals come to the salon after their office hours. The new restrictions mean we will lose a lot of customers,” said Tashi Shanvi, supervisor of a salon at Hanuman Nagar. Aviral Kumar, fitness coach at a popular gym on Boring Road, said the footfall of customers has declined with new restrictions in place. “We sanitise our equipment and staff members twice daily and follow all the Covid protocols. However, the time limit fixed by the government is unfair to us,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/shops-small-business-establishments-in-patna-down-shutters-at-7pm/articleshow/82008887.cms||---

The Community Health Centre at Bicholim held its first community vaccination programme against Covid-19 at Ladfe and Nanoda villages in Bicholim taluka. Around 129 people in Ladfe and 91 people in Nanoda took their first jab. Besides this, another 263 people were also vaccinated at CHC Bicholim from other parts of the taluka. This took the total beneficiary numbers to 483 in Bicholim on Saturday itself. No adverse events were reported. A vaccination camp was similarly held at Loliem-Polem panchayat. It began at 10am and closed at 4pm. During this time, 307 villagers of Loliem-Polem were provided the first dose of vaccination against Covid-19 by the Canacona Community Health Centre staff under the directives of acting health officer, Dr Jose Tavares. Of the 307, 134 were senior citizens. “This camp could materialise here only because of chief minister Pramod Sawant and health minister Viswajit Rane. I thank the CM, the health minister, the health officer of CHC, Canacona, and his staff and of course the sarpanch and all the panchas,” said Canacona MLA Isidore Fernandes. The camp will be held at Poinguinim village panchayat on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/good-response-to-inoculation-drive-in-bicholim-canacona/articleshow/82009955.cms||---

---||Goa||In first two games, Champions League intensity will take FC Goa players by surprise: Juan Ferrando||Panaji: Coach Juan Ferrando is preparing FC Goa for their debut in the AFC Champions League, a first for an Indian club. Despite several departures, the Goan side did well in the Indian Super League (ISL) with a semifinal appearance, losing to eventual champions Mumbai City FC in sudden death tiebreaker. Ferrando’s team still enjoys the record of a 15-match unbeaten run, but the Spanish coach explains why the Champions League will be a different challenge. Excerpts from an interview with TOI… What does it mean for the team to be playing in the AFC Champions League? It’s a big responsibility. This is, after all, a first for an Indian club. There are strong teams, big squads, high-profile players and great coaches. For us, this is a great opportunity to learn. This is a competition where you need to have a strong mentality and work hard. If we are not focused for 90 minutes, we are asking for trouble. Are FC Goa ready for the Champions League? It’s the first time for everyone in this competition and it’s necessary for everyone to be ready. I worked for several months with this team. We are getting better. But we still need to work on some details. For example, the situation of one versus one, dribbling, concepts about intensity. We are not ready, only because the level of the league in India is not the same as ACL. But this is our problem. Sure, our players, in the first and second game, in the first 10 or 20 minutes, they will be surprised, because the intensity is different. Throw-ins, fouls, freekicks, it’s totally different. It will be high-level stuff. What are the improvements that Goa need for the Champions League? In ISL, for example, it’s fine if you control the ball, take three or four touches. But in Champions League, that’s a very easy chance for opponents to press. In attack, there should be maximum one or two touches and good dribbling. The most important detail is to keep the ball. If you lose, it’s a transition and opponents will make you pay. You left out Igor Angulo, the highest goal-scorer in ISL and Alberto Noguera, the highest assist maker… The decision was taken just an hour before I spoke with the players. Before that decision, James (Donachie) had missed training because of injury, (Mohammad) Ali was already injured and Leander (D’Cunha) was recovering from injury. Then we decided it was important to have Ivan (Gonzalez) because he can play in two positions (centre-back and right-back). Edu (Bedia) because he helps us in the build-up and (Jorge) Ortiz can play multiple roles (in attack). When Ivan was in, it was necessary to lose Igor and Alberto. Igor is a very, very good player, but he’s No. 9. Alberto is more or less 10 or 8. If Ali or Leander were not injured, and James was fine in training, the squad would have been different. This is the truth. Now that the foreign attacking players are missing, will there be a different approach? Our style remains the same. Of course, it’s very difficult to have the ball like in ISL for majority of the match, but our approach is the same. We try to build from the back, create space, use the space and in the end, cross and shoot. That’s our style. The aim is to play in the opponent’s half. We know that the opponents will have more quality, so we will be under pressure. For many moments during the game, it won’t be the same as ISL. Five of six Goa matches will kick off at 10.30pm. Does that affect preparations? Late kick offs are normal in Europe. In my point of view, it’s good. You have time to prepare. In the mornings, you can do some activation, hour by hour. For Indian players, it will be different. I spoke with them and explained that this is the Champions League. You cannot allow pressure or difficult moments to weigh you down. I look at the late kick off as a positive. It’s much better than playing at 5pm in ISL. Does playing at home give Goa any advantage? When you play the league in a home-and-away format, yes. But when you have six games in 20 days (at the same venue), everyone’s focus is different. In this case, there is no advantage. Everyone knows these are 20 difficult days. You cannot give any excuse of weather or grass (on the turf). Goa have lot of youngsters in the team, many of whom played in ISL for the first time this season. Does that make the task tougher? The players have to learn and be competitive. I don’t like to lose 6-0 and say we learned a lot. That’s not the correct approach. This is a good international competition and we have responsibilities because we are professionals. This is a professional team and we have to be competitive. It’s not normal that after 20 or 30 minutes, if you are not doing well, you get upset and give up. No, no, that’s not acceptable. The game is for 90 minutes and you have to keep fighting. Did you have enough time to study Goa’s opponents? What can you tell us about them? I know Al-Rayyan players, many of whom will be at the World Cup. Their coach is Laurent Blanc, who has been at Barcelona and coached PSG. The style of football is amazing. It’s a very good team. Persepolis have experienced players. They are so clear-minded, both in defence and attack. They have a plan, and it’s the same whether they play in the (domestic) league or ACL. Don’t forget they made it to the final last year. Al Wahda won the playoff and remain a very strong team. You have not yet started training with the match balls that will be used for the tournament. Does that put you at some sort of disadvantage? We have three-four days to check the control of the ball. To be sure about the kick, crosses. In the end, two or three days are enough. Believe me, if you don’t have control of the ball in ISL, it will be the same in ACL. Things won’t change. If you have quality, you can do well with any ball.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-first-two-games-champions-league-intensity-will-take-fc-goa-players-by-surprise-juan-ferrando/articleshow/82020604.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Private hospitals fleecing patients under lens||VIJAYAWADA: The Krishna district administration has turned its attention to regulating the exorbitant fees collected by a number of corporate hospitals for Covid-19 treatment. Authorities of the health wing have asked the public to opt for Covid-19 treatment at 14 hospitals that are permitted to treat moderate to severe cases. The number of new Covid-19 infections in the district surged from April 1. While 1,700 Covid-19 cases were registered in the district in March 2021, this number is likely to increase as 1,900 positive cases have already been registered in the first week of April. Though a majority of the cases are low risk and display mild symptoms, health wing authorities have arranged 1,500 beds in various hospitals. Officials expect the number of cases may peak by the end of the month. Meanwhile, the health wing is heading to initiate stringent action against hospitals that are found providing in-patient treatment without permission. The decision was taken in view of the fire accident at the Covid-19 care centre run by Ramesh Hospital at Swarna Palace Hotel in August last year. “We are continuously monitoring the Covid-19 situation. Many patients are complaining that corporate hospitals are looting them by charging exorbitant fees for treatment of Covid-19. A specific fee structure is fixed for clinical procedures, right from the bed at the intensive care unit to a ventilator. Any complaint received against hospitals for harassing patients in the name of additional charges will be strictly punished,” district medical and health officer (DM&HO) Dr Suhasini. District collector A Md Imtiaz said that only 12 corporate hospitals are permitted to treat Covid-19 cases. As many as 1,086 beds are available at these hospitals. The collector added that Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 wards have been arranged at Vijayawada and Machilipatnam government hospitals, while emergency services will function as usual.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/pvt-hosps-fleecing-patients-under-lens/articleshow/82009042.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat crematoriums overflow with dead amid Covid-19 surge||SURAT/AHMEDABAD: All pyres at crematoriums in four major cities of Gujarat — Surat, Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Rajkot — are burning incessantly with more bodies waiting in queue for their turn. Such is the deluge that crematoriums are expanding their boundaries to accommodate the bodies, though the state government said only 49 Covid deaths were recorded across Gujarat on Saturday, taking its overall Covid toll to 4,746. Last time 49 people had succumbed to Covid on a single day on May 5, 2020, when the first wave was at its peak. In Surat, before the pandemic, Ramnath Ghela Crematorium (RGC), Umra, and Kurukshetra Crematorium (KC), Jahangirpura, used to receive 20 bodies on average daily, but for the past two weeks, they have been receiving around 80 bodies. Ashwini Kumar Crematorium (AKC), Surat’s biggest one, used to attend to more than 30 bodies, but now it has been cremating 110 bodies on average daily. AKC has nine gas furnaces in working condition and four stands for the wooden pyre. Meanwhile, chief minister Vijay Rupani on Saturday denied reports that the state government was hiding the true Covid death data. “As per the guidelines of the ICMR, if a comorbid patient dies, then a committee of experts decides the primary and secondary causes of death. If that committee identifies the main cause of the death as heart attack, then even though the patient was infected with coronavirus, such death is not counted as Covid death. The same system is followed in the entire country,” he said in Ahmedabad. This may explain how more ‘Covid-19 dead’ bodies are reaching crematoriums through Covid-protocol but may not be labelled as Covid-19 deaths. Meanwhile, viral videos of bodies waiting in queue at AKC put the government under pressure to make alternative arrangements to reduce scrutiny. An adjoining ground of RGC has turned into a crematorium and Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) teams on Saturday afternoon set up light poles and other infrastructure for emergency use there. “Those dying natural deaths are being cremated on a wooden pyre. Light poles are being installed so that cremation can continue even at night,” said an SMC employee at the spot. Similar facility is also being created at Jahangirpura, where the authorities have set up new stands for wooden pyre on the bank of river Tapi. In Rajkot too, deaths continue in double digits across hospitals. However, according to the district collector’s office, of the 89 people who died during Covid treatment between April 6 and 8, only 14 succumbed to the coronavirus, though all the dead were cremated as per Covid protocol. Trustees of the biggest crematorium of Rajkot — Ramnathpara crematorium — maintain that they are cremating 20 bodies as per Covid protocol daily. In Ahmedabad, estimated two dozen bodies were cremated at Vadaj, Dudheshwar and Thaltej crematoriums as per Covid protocol on Saturday, though only 16 deaths due to coronavirus were reported in the district. While the state government’s health bulletin on Friday stated that there were six deaths in Vadodara, the bulletin issued locally by Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) mentioned only two.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amid-covid-surge-gujarat-crematoriums-overflow-with-dead/articleshow/82009936.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Visakhapatnam||Vaccine coverage in above 60 age group only 18% in Andhra Pradesh||VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh has so far administered the Covid-19 vaccine to about 36.79 lakh people, including 12.69 lakh people aged 60-plus. According to the projected population numbers of 2020-21, the number of elderly population stands at 70.64 lakh in Andhra Pradesh. These numbers translate into Covid-19 vaccine coverage of only some 18% in an age group that has been hit hard by the pandemic both in terms of fatalities as well as case severity. This can be corroborated by the fact that about 70% of deaths associated with the pandemic in Andhra Pradesh were among people aged 50 years and above. On the contrary, 75% of total cases reported in the state were among people below the age of 50. In fact, the 61-70 age group has been the most affected, accounting for nearly one-fourth of all deaths. The vaccine coverage among the elderly population of Andhra Pradesh is far lower than the national average of 26%. States such as Rajasthan, Sikkim, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh have given anti-coronavirus jabs to at least 40% of their elderly population. It will be recalled that Andhra Pradesh rolled out the vaccination drive for this age group on March 1. According to experts, several factors such as lack of awareness over registration on CoWin portal, limited functional ability, initial vaccine hesitancy with sporadic adverse events and deaths, presumed special risks associated with comorbidities, lack of technical knowledge to book online appointments, absence of support from family or friends and limited vaccination centres, etc. may have led to this situation. Speaking to STOI, Dr K Rambabu said that initially there was some vaccine hesitancy and fears among the elderly population. “The vaccine coverage among this age group has been gradually improving with increasing vaccination centres. Recently, the health department has started giving jabs at the secretariats to make it convenient for the public to receive the vaccine almost at their doorsteps,” said Dr Rambabu. As many as 13.21 lakh people aged between 45 and 60 years have received the vaccine in Andhra Pradesh, while 4.48 lakh people in the 25-40 age bracket have been vaccinated. Vaccine coverage in the 18-25 age group is about 1.34 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vaccine-coverage-in-above-60-age-group-only-18-in-ap/articleshow/82009089.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Stop! Check if your coconut water is pesticide-free||RAJKOT: It’s summer and the demand for tender coconut water will soar above the mercury. Many farmers, however, use poisonous monocrotophos pesticide in coconut plants to kill insect and also increase yield. While you may think of coconut water as an elixir, long term consumption of pesticide-laced coconut water can also lead to many unwanted diseases. But don’t worry, you can now check for yourself to find if the coconut water you are relishing is pesticide free or not. Researchers at chemistry department of Kutch University have claimed to have developed a chemical reagent that can identify pesticide residue in coconut water. A reagent is a substance or compound added to cause, or test a chemical reaction. The varsity is now planning to register a patent for this innovation, which is part of an MSc dissertation work. According to researchers, farmers have to wait for 45 days before harvesting coconut once they apply pesticide. But in many cases, farmers harvest earlier to earn more, thus feeding people pesticide-laced coconut water. Students Manali Goswami and Narendrasinh Ravubha Chudasama developed the reagent under the guidance of assistant professor Vijay Ram. Chudasama has a coconut orchard at his village in Mangrol taluka in Junagadh district. Here he separated the fruits into ones with pesticide and the other organic. “A person has to mix this reagent with peel or coconut water and if the colour turn red, then pesticide has been used. We conducted some tests in our chemistry laboratory to find that the results shown are correct. The reddish colour water had chemical residue, which was confirmed even by laboratory testing,” said Prof Ram, adding that the students now want to establish the quantity of chemical residue in the fruit water. “We collected both coconut water with and without chemical residue and conducted nearly 100 trials in one month to prove that our reagent works perfectly,” the student duo said. Prof Ram said that they would want to develop a testtube kit with this reagent which will be put up commercially in the market once they get the patent. “Traders may also check pesticide in the orchards using this kit before purchasing coconut which will eliminate the possibility of coconut grown with pesticide coming into the market,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/stop-check-if-your-coconut-water-is-pesticide-free/articleshow/82009946.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

This is the highest single-day case total in at least the last five-and-a-half months. The cumulative case load currently stands at 9,21,906. The toll increased to 7,291 as 12 more people succumbed to the pandemic, again a five-month high in terms of daily fatalities. The deceased are from Chittoor, Nellore, Visakhapatnam, Srikakulam, Anantapur, Guntur and Krishna districts. As many as 1,053 people were declared cured on Saturday. The state currently has 18,666 active cases with 8,95,949 cumulative recoveries and 7,291 fatalities. Four districts—Chittoor (3,486 active cases), Guntur (2,615), Visakhapatnam (2,382) and Krishna (2,161)—accounted for nearly 60% of the total active cases in the state. Chittoor reported a record 740 new infections, followed by Guntur (527), Visakhapatnam (391), Kurnool (296), Srikakulam (279) and Krishna (278). Only two districts recorded fewer than 100 cases. Andhra Pradesh tested 31,929 samples on Saturday to detect 3,309 new cases, translating to a case positivity rate of 10.4%, the highest in the last six months. The ever-increasing case positivity rate has become a major concern for the state.

The lungs have been flown for transplant to Hyderabad through a green corridor on Saturday. A spokesperson from Care Hospital, where the youth was admitted, said that ADCP (traffic) Ch Adinarayana facilitated the green corridor to the airport to transport the lungs for transplantation at a hospital in Hyderabad while his kidneys, liver and eyes have been retrieved to be harvested in various hospitals in Vizag. BBA graduate Metta Teja left home at Madhavdhara on his two-wheeler late in the evening on April 7 to meet some friends while his father was off to attend night duty. According to his family members, on being called up at around midnight, Teja told his mother that he would be returning home soon. In the early hours of April 8, Teja’s mother got a call from two passersby on Visakha Valley School Road, who used the boy’s phone to inform his parents about Teja’s accident. Meanwhile, an 108 ambulance was also called and Teja was taken to the casualty wing at King George Hospital (KGH), where the doctors said there was no hope for his survival. His parents nonetheless admitted the boy to Care Hospital, where the doctors declared him brain dead on April 9. “After our son was declared brain dead, Jeevandan coordinators counselled us about organ donation. I thought that though God has taken him back, the Almighty intends to save the lives of others through my child. So we readily agreed to the donation,” said Teja’s father Tirupathi Rao. Teja is survived by his parents and an elder sister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/brain-dead-youth-to-give-new-lease-of-life-to-6-others/articleshow/82009267.cms||---

The injured, Saroj Devi (40), was admitted to the sadar hospital at Gopalganj where her condition is stated to be critical. The deceased was identified as Badri Thakur, a retired employee of the education department. The incident took place around 10am when Thakur was walking on the road outside his shop dealing in computer parts. Two youths riding a motorcycle reached the spot and pumped two bullets into him. Saroj was also attacked when she came to the rescue of her father. She received bullet injuries on her thigh and abdomen. The assailants, however, managed to escape after the incident. Gopalganj SDPO Naresh Paswan said prima facie the incident appeared to be a fallout of land dispute. “Thakur had purchased a plot of land from a man having shady background,” he added. Thakur’s relative Jitendra Thakur said the former was about to leave for his village along with his daughter when the incident occurred. The SDPO said raids were on to arrest the culprits. The locals have, meanwhile, expressed concern over deteriorating law and order in the district. Earlier, two people were killed by a group of criminals at Rajapur Bazar. The locals have threatened to launch an agitation if the police failed to contain crime in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/man-shot-over-land-dispute-in-gopalganj-daughter-hurt/articleshow/82008721.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Shot in arm before ink on finger, it’s safety first this poll season||Kolkata: Tapan Bhattacharya, a septuagenarian from Bramhapur (Bansdroni) has never failed to cast his vote by noon — be it parliamentary, assembly or civic elections — in the past five decades. But Saturday was different for this retired private firm employee as he chose to visit a vaccination centre first, took the jab and then headed to the polling booth. “I am conscious about exercising my franchise every time I get to vote. But now I am more concerned about protecting my family and myself from the virus. If you talk about priority, vaccination comes first. Elections can wait,” Bhattacharya told TOI after taking the jab at a Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) vaccination centre in Bansdroni which has been drawing a large number of citizens over the past two weeks after a surge in Covid cases. Tapasree Chakraborty, a homemaker from Tollygunge, also visited this KMC-run centre as the civic body had to shut several others for want of vaccine doses. ‘“I had come yesterday and stood in a long queue, but had to return home empty handed as stock of vaccines had expired. I was told to turn up today. I can wait for the vaccine for longer hours. So if I fail to turn up at the polling booth on time, I don’t mind,” she said. Teacher Raja Dhar, however, was not as lucky as Bhattacharya or Chakraborty — who were among the last vaccine recipients, after whom the doors of the Bansdroni centre were closed due to non-availability of stock. Dhar had decided to visit KMC’s Atabagan vaccination centre, but found the entire building was converted into a polling booth. “I was upset to find the vaccination centre had been converted into a polling booth. How can this be possible?” Dhar asked. Similarly, Ipsita Bose, a businesswoman who turned up at the KMC-run Layelka vaccination centre, found the gates closed. “I need to return tomorrow and stand in a long queue,” she said. A TOI team also found gates of a state health department-run vaccination centre at Sulekha closed. Sikha Som from Santoshpur had come to this centre with her husband Animesh. Som, in her late sixties, expressed anguish over the closure without prior notice. “One of my friends had recommended this centre since it was close to my home and run by the government. But to my surprise, I found the gates locked,” Som said. A senior KMC health department official conceded the civic brass had decided to keep several vaccination centres shut for shortage of doses. “While a few ward health centres were handed over as makeshift polling booths, we needed to keep some centres shut because of no supply of vaccine. Some open centres had to be shut later as the stock ran dry,” the official said. The civic body was hoping to get a fresh supply by Monday, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/shot-in-arm-before-ink-on-finger-its-safety-first-this-poll-season/articleshow/82009598.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Vadodara||Treatment in lobbies, triage areas||Vadodara: As Central Gujarat’s biggest public hospital — SSG Hospital in Vadodara — is witnessing an unprecedented rush, Covid-19 patients are brimming even outside Covid wards and ICUs. Patients are now being treated even in lobbies, triage and OPD areas of the hospital where they are provided oxygen support while on wheelchairs and stretchers, waiting for their turn to get a bed. The situation is no different at GMERS Medical College and Hospital, Gotri, where like SSG, the influx of patients is more than daily discharges and deaths. On Friday, the two hospitals put together had more than 1,250 Covid patients — the highest ever and this number is continuously on the rise. The hospitals are packaged even as their capacities have been increased multiple times. Within this week, the total capacity in SSG Hospital was increased from 650 beds to 750 by converting B1 and B2 wards in the new surgical building for Covid patients. “We have opened all our reserve capacities, but the rush of patients is unabated. Originally, we had 575 beds which were increased to 750, but as of now, there is no vacancy. All our 250 ICU beds too are occupied,” SSG Hospital’s medical superintendent Dr Ranjan Aiyer told TOI. On Saturday, after another review meeting, it was decided to convert psychiatry ward into Covid ward by installing 50 oxygen concentrators to scale up the hospital’s capacity to 800 beds — which too might not be enough if the flow of patients continues with the same pace. Against an average daily discharge of about 40 patients, the hospitals are witnessing as many as 90 new admissions. Aiyer said that the hospital staff has no other option but to provide treatment to patients whether it is lobby area or triage. “We have constraints, but saving a life is our priority. Till the time, as the patient gets a bed, they are provided oxygen support as immediate relief,” he said. The sudden jump in occupancy has come in less than a week. At the beginning of this week, there were nearly 100 ICU beds that were vacant. At Gotri hospital too, patients are being treated inside Covid OPDs while they wait for beds to get vacant in wards. “At both these hospitals, patients are dropped through the 108 emergency ambulance service or through private ambulance service providers. The ambulances too have to pick up another patient. So, after they drop the patients, the staff on duty starts providing whatever support they can till the time patient gets admitted,” said an official at Gotri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/treatment-in-lobbies-triage-areas/articleshow/82008998.cms||Prashant Rupera
---||Pune||Pune, Mumbai corner half of January-March housing sales in India||PUNE: Stable prices, low interest rates and government sops helped push up sales and launches in the Pune and Mumbai housing market in the first three months of 2021, helping them corner half of the sales in India, reports by a number of real estate observers revealed. Real estate aggregator and broker PropTiger showed that the Pune housing market grew even faster than Mumbai in January to March this year over the October-December period last year, registering a 19% growth in sales. Despite the numbers being marginally lesser than those of the first three months of 2020, PropTiger said all stakeholders in the real estate market have sentiments “on the up”. “As the economy gradually marches towards recovery, the residential real estate market in the country is also seeing a positive momentum on the back of various measures taken by the Centre and state governments, the RBI and the entire banking system. This positive change is visible in the first three months of 2021 through a rise in supply numbers, an indication that developers are more comfortable now with regard to liquidity support and buyer sentiment,” Dhruv Agarwala, group CEO of PropTiger, Housing.com, and Makaan.com, said. Real estate observer Knight Frank said a significant number of new launches in the Pune market grew both in terms of quarters and year-on-year. Launches in Pune rose by around 43% in first three months of 2021, over the corresponding period in the last year. Their report said despite loans being cheaper and bumper sales, prices stayed largely stable, with a drop of around 3% over the last year. “The first three months of 2021 saw a significant rise in sales across the key markets, led by Mumbai and Pune – the two markets that received substantial backing from the state government in the form of reduced stamp duty. Other cities also recorded a rise in sales of homes due to a shift in attitude in homebuyers that has now started to prefer ownership. That coupled with home loan interest rates at multi-decade lows of sub-7%, a substantial correction in apartment prices, as well as rise in household savings, seems to have convinced homebuyers that this was an opportune time to purchase their properties,” said Shishir Baijal, chairman and managing director of Knight Frank. Anarock said the recent rise in sales in the Pune and Mumbai markets also tilted the housing market heavily towards the region. In the first three months of 2021, the Mumbai and Pune real estate markets took up around 53% of the total sales in that period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-mumbai-corner-half-of-jan-march-hsg-sales-in-india/articleshow/82009956.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: In a first, Araku pepper to line market shelves in Denmark||VISAKHAPATNAM: The tribal farmers of Araku Valley are all set to export pepper to Denmark, the first foreign country to receive this tribal produce from Araku. Pepper is currently grown on an extent of about 98,000 acres in the Agency areas of Visakhapatnam, majorly as an intercrop inside the coffee plantations in Araku, Ananthagiri, Chintapalli and Paderu. The coffee produced in these tribal pockets is already being exported to several European and other countries. Speaking to STOI, assistant director (coffee), Integrated Tribal Development Agency-Paderu, V Radhakrishna said that pepper plantations in these tribal areas will produce an average of 3,000 to 4,000 tonnes of dry pepper. “The ITDA would generally distribute 100 pepper plants per acre of coffee plantation. The pepper plants are grown as creepers on shade-giving trees in the coffee plantations such as silver oak, jackfruit, etc. In all, the coffee plantations are grown on about 1.58 lakh acres, producing nearly 11,000 metric tonnes of clean coffee. Under the direction of our ITDA project officer (PO) Venkateswar Salijamala, we want to take up more initiatives in the future,” said Radhakrishna. Manoj Kumar, CEO of the Naandi foundation, which trains and handholds Araku tribal farmers in land productivity, organic farming protocols, crop and pest management and market connections, tweeted about the order for 23 metric tonnes of pepper from Denmark, stating this “will herald Araku becoming globally acclaimed for pepper too”. Quoting Manoj Kumar’s tweet, noted industrialist Anand Mahindra tweeted; “Araku Valley is fast becoming one of the world’s best labs for a new, sustainable, value-added form of agriculture & a new community-based lifestyle. Watch this space. Araku could be the new Shangri-La. (sic),” ITDA assistant director Radhakrishna said the agency has taken up a pilot project in Chintapalli, namely the Chintapalli Tribal Organic Coffee, to make tribal farmers self-sustainable in terms of coffee processing and establishing better market linkages. “The ITDA established the infrastructure with about Rs 1.5 crore for this project in Chintapalli. About 10,000 farmers have been formed into small groups in Chintapalli for this project. Several corporate companies are vying for Araku coffee due to its quality,” said Radhakrishna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/in-a-first-araku-pepper-to-line-market-shelves-in-denmark/articleshow/82009014.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Its limited supply and spiralling demand are also causing problems at the city hospitals. “Short or delayed supply of Remdesivir is leading to problems in treatment of Covid positive patients,” said Dr Sanjeev Kumar, nodal officer of the Covid ward at All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna. Dr Satish Kumar, deputy superintendent of Nalanda Medical College and Hospital, said Remdesivir is used only in certain cases like severe problems in breathing. “Its limited supply and spiralling demand often lead to its shortage,” he said. Assistant drug controller, Patna, Bishwajeet Das Gupta also admitted the shortage of this injection. “Its demand in March had reached zero. The drug dealers had stopped stocking Remdesivir, fearing expiry. However, the demand for the drug has suddenly increased following rise in Covid cases,” he added. Gupta, however, said the drug department and dealers were trying their best to ensure uninterrupted supply of Remdesivir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/remdesivir-missing-from-hospitals-in-patna-as-covid-cases-surge/articleshow/82009110.cms||---

The kits would be procured by the Bihar Medical Services and Infrastructure Development Limited in advance for storage and distribution. The kits will help in containing the transmission of the virus, he said. The kits to be procured include RNA extraction kit, N-95 masks, PPE kits, Antigen kits, RTPCA kits, 3-Ply masks and sanitisers.

---||Patna||Bihar cop lynched during raid at Bengal village||PATNA: A police inspector posted as a station house officer (SHO) in Kishanganj district was beaten to death by a mob during a raid in the adjoining North Dinajpur district in West Bengal in the wee hours of Saturday. The deceased, Ashwini Kumar (52), was the SHO of the Kishanganj model police station. The incident took place around 3.30 am when the SHO along with half a dozen police personnel had gone to nab the kingpin of a motorbike lifters' gang. Some residents of Pantapara village under Panjipara police station in the neighbouring state engaged in a verbal duel, and tried to stop the raiding team from entering the house of the gang leader. The SHO intervened when the complainant of a stolen motorbike, who was accompanying the raiding team, was pelted with stones and thrashed by the residents. The mob then turned on the SHO, who tried to intervene, and beat him mercilessly. Other members of the Kishanganj police team managed to escape. On getting information, IG (Purnia range) Suresh Prasad Choudhary and Kishanganj SP Ashish Anand contacted their counterparts in West Bengal, who sent a police team to the spot. The injured SHO was rushed to Islampur sub-divisional hospital where he has declared dead. IG Choudhary said three people, including Firoz Alam, stated to be involved in motorbike thefts, were taken into custody and brought to Kishanganj for interrogation. "Raids are on to nab others involved in the killing of the police officer," he told this newspaper over the phone. The deceased SHO, stated to be a resident of Panchu Tola, under Janki Nagar police station in Purnia district, was posted in Kishanganj about a year ago. His body was handed over to the family after a guard of honour accorded to him at the police lines. Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Saturday inquired from the DGP SK Singhal about the killing of the Kishanganj police inspector in West Bengal. The CM instructed the DGP to give compensation and other benefits to the deceased's family at the earliest. The DGP informed the CM that three suspects have been arrested in connection with the incident. He also talked to the DGP of West Bengal who assured cooperation in the investigation. The CM later directed the authorities concerned to provide job to the victim's family on compassionate ground. Sources in the Bihar police headquarters said DGP Singhal spoke to his West Bengal counterpart and expressed displeasure over the non-cooperation of the West Bengal police during the operation. Kishanganj DSP Anwar Javed said the two mobile phones of the SHO, which were missing since the incident, have been recovered. He said the site of occurrence is hardly 12 km from the Kishanganj district headquarters. IG Choudhary, however, denied any political angle in the incident. The spot falls under the Golpokhar assembly seat, where the election will be held on April 22. This is not an isolated incident. Earlier, the SHO of Majorganj police station Dinesh Ram was killed by suspected liquor smugglers during a raid in Sitamarhi district on February 24. On Friday, Sitamarhi police arrested one of the prime accused Shivam Singh alias Tuktuk Singh from Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/kishanganj-sho-lynched-by-mob-in-bengal-village/articleshow/82009189.cms||Ramashankar

A presentation was made before the CM on the development of Darbhanga airport. Nitish said the airport would be named after the legendary Maithili poet Vidyapati and a resolution to this effect has been unanimously passed by the state assembly. The CM said the airport whose foundation was laid in 2018 has come as a boon for the Mithilanchal region and other parts of Bihar neighbouring areas. He asked officials to hold talks with the officials of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and the Indian Air Force (IAF) to develop the Darbhanga airport because it was important for the people of north Bihar and adjoining areas. Nitish also stressed the need for raising the height of the boundary wall of the airport. Among those who attended the meeting included water resources development minister Sanjay Jha, CM’s principal secretaries Dipak Kumar and Chanchal Kumar, cabinet additional chief secretary Sanjay Kumar and other officials while Patna airport director Bhupesh CH Negi and Darbhanga DM Thiyagrajan SM joined through video conferencing. Earlier in March, the ministry of civil aviation had urged the Bihar CM for his intervention in land acquisition for the development of the new and bigger civil enclave. The AAI asked the state government to provide 78-acres on the southern side of the runway, which was earmarked by them in February. Around 54 acres are required for the permanent civil enclave, including the terminal building, cargo, multi-level car parking, fire station and other auxiliary buildings, while 24-acres for the installation of Category I (CAT I) approach light for uninterrupted flight operation during bad and foggy weather conditions in wintertime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-reviews-darbhanga-airport-development-assures-more-amenities-soon/articleshow/82009114.cms||Faryal Rumi

Passing the above directive, head of the department (HoD) of CAT, Allahabad Bench, Justice Vijay Lakshmi said that after this period, the situation would be reviewed and further decisions would be taken accordingly, after consultation with office-bearers of CAT Bar Association. While taking this unprecedented decision, the HoD further said, “All of us are aware that the cases of Covid-19 are rising day by day and have already reached an alarming situation. Several lawyers have passed away in the last few days only due to Covid. More so, some employees of CAT have also been tested positive recently.” Earlier, at one stage, the CAT Bar Association, Allahabad, after an emergent meeting, under the presidentship of its president Anil Kumar Singh, had sent a proposal on Friday to close the CA, at least for one week. According to vice-president of CAT Bar, Jitendra Nayak, the proposal of CAT Bar Association was immediately forwarded by the HoD here to the Chairman, Principal Bench, Delhi, seeking suitable directions. Acting upon it, the chairman had directed that let the HoD take the decision, after discussing the matter with the CAT Bar here. In view of the above and after a discussion with members and office- bearers of CAT Bar Association, it was resolved unanimously that the CAT here and its circuit Bench at Nainital will remain closed till April 18. “The caretaker will ensure proper sanitisation of the CAT campus here before its sealing,” the order of HOD added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/cat-in-prayagraj-nainital-bench-closed-till-april-18/articleshow/82009971.cms||---

Official sources said the government is working on the option to have the talks ahead of a proposed visit by Japanese PM Yoshihide Suga later this month. Facing mounting Chinese intrusions in East China Sea, where the countries are locked in a dispute over the Japan-held uninhabited Senkaku/ Diaoyu islands, Tokyo has been keen to resume physical engagements with India. Finalisation of dates for Suga’s maiden visit could depend on the Covid situation here. A report by Japan’s NHK said on Saturday, as China continues to assert itself across the region, the Japanese government is increasingly looking to India as a partner that shares basic values and can help work toward a free and open Indo-Pacific. Suga is travelling to Washington next week for a meeting with US President Joe Biden on April 16. Suga has been speaking his mind on South China Sea, Xinjiang and Hong Kong and brought up these even in a phone conversation with PM Modi ahead of the first Quad summit earlier this year. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi was reported last week to have warned Japan against wading into US-China politics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/faced-with-chinese-threat-japan-keen-on-boosting-india-ties/articleshow/82010882.cms||---
---||Pune||PCMC to free rivers of hyacinth||Pune: The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has decided to remove hyacinth from Pavana, Mula and Indrayani rivers which pass through its limits. The plan is to clear/remove hyacinth spread over a 30 km stretch of these rivers. Currently, all three rivers are filled with hyacinth and their condition is filthy at multiple locations. This has created health issues in several localities in PCMC, particularly in housing societies situated near the rivers. The civic body has decided to complete the task in five phases even though there is no clarity on the deadline. PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil said, “Our endeavour would be to complete it before the monsoon.” However, activists described the corporation’s move as “aimless”. Maruti Bhapkar, an activist, who has been pursuing the issue for the last few years, said, “The PCMC has issued expression of interest (EoI) now. It will take another few weeks to complete the tender process. It means work would start at the end of May. By then, the monsoon will start. The hyacinth would flow with the water. The appointed agency would make money from it.” “This issue is not new in PCMC area. If the corporation really wanted to remove hyacinth, why didn’t it award the contract in January/ February,” Bhapkar added. He said the corporation has done little in this regard over the years. “Numerous housing societies release their sewage water into the rivers. Also, industrial units release effluents openly. Why can’t the health department act against them?” Additional commissioner Vikas Dhakne told TOI, “We have drawn up a comprehensive plan. The tender process would be carried out in a proper and transparent manner.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-to-free-rivers-of-hyacinth/articleshow/82009959.cms||Sandip Dighe

It irrigates around 15,000 acres of farmland from Kalingarayanpalayam to Kodumudi covering about 85km. Environment activist M Ponnaiyan said the shutters of the canal was closed about a month ago and the canal currently holds about 100 cusecs of water. The activist alleged that residents along the canal and sanitary workers were dumping garbage in the canal. “Continuous letting of effluents from the dyeing units has already spoiled the water. Now plastic items will further damage the waterbody,” he said, adding plastic items would hinder water flow besides degrading the water quality. He urged the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) look into the issue at the earliest and safeguard the canal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dumped-garbage-degrades-water-in-kalingarayan-canal/articleshow/82009629.cms||---

Commuters including merchants and IT company employees were affected because of the strike. As the dependence upon the TNSTC buses led to crowding in the buses, commuters urged the TNSTC to operate more buses. Based on the requests, the TNSTC operated additional 20 buses on Saturday.

---||Kolkata||Coronavirus, polls kill markets ahead of Poila Baisakh||KOLKATA: Hawkers and traders of Gariahat and Hatibagan, the twin shopping hubs at either ends of Kolkata that traditionally attract lakhs of customers on the final weekend before Poila Baisakh, the Bengali New Year day, did very little business on Saturday as elections and Covid played spoilsport. At the wholesale market Burrabazar, too, the situation was no different with traders counting losses as business sentiment touched a low. Gariahat’s pavements that are usually chock-a-block during Chaitra sale wore a deserted look on Saturday as elections in neighbouring Tollygunge and Kasba kept people away. “Gariahat usually attracts a few lakh people on the final weekend prior to Poila Baisakh. Most hawkers and shopkeepers are so busy that they do not get time to even have lunch. Usually, everyone survives on adrenaline and umpteen cups of tea and biscuits. But on Saturday, not even a few hundred had turned up till evening. There were hawkers dozing off in the afternoon. Others who received a few customers did paltry business. We hope the situation will improve late evening and on Sunday. Or else, everyone will be counting huge losses as there was no indication that it would be this bad when traders and hawkers stocked up a month ago,” said Indira Hawkers’ Union secretary Debraj Ghosh. The situation was not very different at Hatibagan that had done brisk business during Durga Puja and Saraswati Puja and had hoped Poila Baisakh would bring good tidings after drawing a blank last year, when lockdown was announced. “Last year, we were confined to our homes and everyone was taking guard against Covid. The situation this year is very different. The fear has gone. We should all be wearing masks. But when one sees politicians including the Prime Minister and chief minister not wear masks and addressing lakhs of people in crowded rallies, it does send a very wrong message. And while it may not hurt them, we are impacted when Covid rises,” said Hatibagan Bazaar Merchants’ Welfare Association president Ranjan Roy. Polls and pandemic has hit the wholesale hub in Burrabazar too. A week before Poila Baisakh, shops in whole sale markets like Sadasukh Katra, Raja Katra, Gandhi Katra, Bagri Market, Ezra Street, usually brim with customers. Retailers from neighbouring districts come to Burrabazar and Posta to buy things in bulk before the festival. But this year, pandemic and polls have impacted the business. “A big percentage of retailers have not come this time. Some are scared to venture into the markets due to the spike in the number of Covid cases. Other have not been able to come due to the polls and related restrictions and news of violence,” said Amit Goenka, a wholesaler of women apparels on Kali Krishna Tagore Street. Since the elections are being held in several phases, movement of vehicles and people have been impacted in the region. Several long-distance buses have been taken over by the administration to conduct polls, which has disrupted travel between districts and Kolkata. “Many people are scared of coming to Kolkata during elections because of violence,” opined Sushil Meghani, a wholesaler of cosmetics in Bagri Market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/corona-polls-kill-markets-ahead-of-poila-baisakh/articleshow/82009634.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Mumbai||2 accused of murder attempt aquitted after 36 years in Mumbai||MUMBAI: In one of longest pending cases before the sessions court, two men, accused of attempted murder of a restaurant manager, were acquitted almost 36 years after the alleged incident. The FIR was registered at Bhandup police station in August 1985. Two accused, Arjun Lokhande and Balya Kadam, died during the pendency of the case, Rohidas Kharat (58) and Mahesh Khare (60), were out on bail. Except the investigating officer, all other witnesses were untraceable. Observing that the evidence was insufficient, the court said, “No evidence has been put forth and nothing incriminating could be brought on record by the prosecution against the present accused. The prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.”  It was alleged that on August 10, 1985, the victim Jaya Shetty was sitting at the counter of the restaurant at about 10am when Lokhande came brandishing a knife and asked him to accompany him. Reportedly, when Shetty refused, three more accused arrived. The FIR said that Lokhande stabbed him on the chest with the other accused joining in the attack. After Shetty fell on the floor, the restaurant staff rushed him to Rajawadi Hospital. Shetty’s statement was recorded after he survived the attack and the accused were subsequently arrested. Kadam’s disclosure statement allegedly led to the recovery of the knife. However, the accused pleaded not guilty after the chargesheet was submitted and charges framed against them. Out on bail, Kharat absconded. He was subsequently traced after warrants were issued against them. In 2019, Kharat was arrested again and he submitted another bail plea. He claimed that due to some urgent and unavoidable circumstances, he went to his native place in Aurangabad after getting bail. He claimed that he assumed that the legal processing were over and never intended to jump bail. Granting him bail for the second time in October 2019, the sessions court said Kharat being a resident of Aurangabad cannot be grounds for refusing bail especially when the accused had already been out on bail. “It is also to be borne in mind the case is of 1986 and since the counsel has assured that the accused would attend the proceedings regularly... there is no reason to deny him bail,” said the court. Thereafter, the trial was further delayed due to the coronavirus lockdown. Witness summons were subsequently issued to the medical officer, the complainant and other witnesses. The summons could not be served at their last known addresses and the prosecution decided to proceed with the sole witness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/2-accused-of-murder-attempt-aquitted-after-36-years-in-mumbai/articleshow/82009966.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Court gives cops law lesson, dismisses 5 lockdown cases||MUMBAI: Dismissing five cases where the police had booked individuals for flouting the lockdown last year, a court has held that charges of spreading infection could not be attracted in the case as the accused had not been tested for Covid-19. “Moreover, there is no documentary evidence for showing that the accused persons had been tested positive for Covid-19. In absence of such material on the record, it can not be said that the accused persons had indulged in any act which was likely to spread infection of Covid-19,” the Vikhroli magistrate court said recently. In each case, the police had submitted a chargesheet invoking Section188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), Section 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and Section 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the IPC and provisions of the National Disaster Management Act, alleging that during the Covid-19 lockdown, the accused were found roaming about without masks and reasonable cause. The prosecution sought commencement of proceedings against the accused, but the court held that the investigating authorities acted without jurisdiction in registering the FIR based on a complaint by the police and added that the investigation conducted by the police was also without jurisdiction. “There is no sufficient grounds for proceeding against the accused persons for the offence punishable under Section 188, 269, 270, 271 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 51(b) of National Disaster Management Act,” the court said. The court further observed that an FIR cannot be registered by the police under Section 188. It said that it was obligatory that the “public servant” before whom the act is committed should file a complaint before the jurisdictional magistrate. “Hence, registration of an FIR for an offence under Section 188 ... is not permitted in law at the instance of police … ,” the court said. On the offence under the Disaster Management Act, the court said the complaint had to be made by a national, state or district authority. The court observed that in contravention of the provisions of the act, the police had not given a minimum of a month’s notice to the accused. “In absence of such statutory compliance, it is nothing but abuse of process of law,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-gives-cops-law-lesson-dismisses-5-lockdown-cases/articleshow/82010373.cms||Rebecca Samervel

He was speaking at the launch of the Information, Education and Communication (IEC) and Capacity Building Programme under the Jal Jeevan Mission at Ravindra Bhavan, Sakhali. The chief minister said Goa is the first state to achieve ‘har ghar nal se jal’ scheme and appreciated the work of PWD officials for achieving this. “Participation of the public in any government mission is very important. Mission like Swayampurna Goa cannot be accomplished without the participation of sarpanch, panchs and various other organisations,” said the chief minister . PWD minister Deepak Pauskar, speaking about the Jal Jeevan Mission, said Goa is far ahead of other states in implementing this project. The minister appealed to the public to take benefit of the ongoing OTS scheme introduced by the PWD to help water consumers to settle their dues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/curb-wastage-of-treated-water-urges-sawant/articleshow/82009960.cms||---

The government is unable to come up with test results on time which is leaving critical patients losing out on the initial ‘golden hours’ of aggressive treatment. Hospitals don’t have beds. Aren’t people being left unattended by the roadside to die,” he asked. “Instead of focussing on the needs of the medical and health department to counter the surge in infections beforehand, the ‘BJP’s star campaigner’ was busy in chest-thumping at election rallies in West Bengal about his government’s ‘bogus achievements’ based on falsehood,” Yadav said, addressing a press conference at party headquarters. “People of the state are in pain and there seems to be no way out for the common man. Those who are duty bound to provide relief to the people are campaigning for elections,” he said. Taking a jibe at the announcement of ‘Teeka Utsav’ to push vaccination, Akhilesh said the government should first streamline its vaccination paraphernalia. “The state government wants to manage ‘Teeka Utsav’ as an event but it should first come clean on what happened in Shamli where a woman went for vaccination? Which vaccine was she administered? The government should have focussed on training of paramedics and technicians in handling vaccination. Inoculation centres are shutting down as they have run out of vaccine stock,” he said. “Instead of preparing for the second wave of infection in advance, all that the government did was to pat its own back. It is another matter that they don’t want to talk about rampant corruption which happened in the purchase of medical equipment and medicines across the state since April 2020,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-leaders-focus-more-on-polls-than-curbing-corona-akhilesh/articleshow/82010361.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Chennai||No rehabilitation homes for kids in conflict with law||Chennai: For a variety of reasons, there has been no response from NGOs to the social welfare department’s call to set up rehabilitation homes for children in conflict with the law.Safety and risk of looking after these children are the main concerns that dissuade NGOs from coming forward. “The most common problem these children face is getting admission in schools once they are released from detention. As a result, they end up in wrong company again and return to observation homes accused of one crime or another,” said an official from the department.The official said that while the department has probation and child protection officers, the involvement of NGOs would ensure better follow-up of the children. “Social workers from NGOs can help address their needs better, connect them to line departments to avail facilities, strengthen their families and most importantly ensure that none of the children are out of school,” the official said.The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, mandates every state to establish special homes, either on its own or through a registered non-governmental organisation, for housing and rehabilitation of these children. The children can stay in these homes for three years, and receive reformative services such education, counselling, therapy, and psychiatric support. While the government runs two such special homes in Kancheepuram and Chennai for girls and boys, respectively, there is a need to open more.“Unlike the West, we do not have the infrastructure or professionals trained to look after these children. We don’t even have government support,” said R Vidyasagar, former child protection specialist, Unicef. He said that it requires a different skillset to work with these children. “In the observation homes, they are kept under lock and key and treated as adult criminals. The same cannot be done in a rehabilitation home. There is a dearth of professionals to handle them. Hence nobody wants to come forward,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/no-rehabilitation-homes-for-kids-in-conflict-with-law/articleshow/82010693.cms||Aditi R

The court also asked authorities to use Nirbhaya funds to help the woman who has delivered a child now. Sexually assaulted when she was 20, the woman is living alone with the child now.A public interest writ petition filed by activist-advocate A P Suryaprakasam, seeking better utilisation of unspent Nirbhaya Funds, is already pending in the Madras high court. TN has spent only Rs 6 crore on women safety projects, he had told the court.The mahila court, however, made the suggestion after special public prosecutor L Srilekha requested the judge to provide funds for the woman living in a pathetic situation. Sessions judge Rajalakshmi found it is lawful to recommend compensation for the woman and for her rehabilitation. She directed the district legal services authority to fix the quantum of compensation payable to the woman. She and her newborn live at an orphanage home for women near Tambaram. She is employed as a daily wager at present.It all started when the woman was staying at her aunt’s house near Elephant Gate. Her aunt’s friend who often visited her house, gave her a drink laced with sedatives before threatening and sexually assaulting her. After she became pregnant, the woman drank kerosene and attempted to end her life. However, she was rescued and admitted to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital.Based on her complaint, the Elephant Gate all-women police arrested the man, and booked him under Sections 376 (rape), 506 (II) (criminal intimidation) of IPC.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Foreign admissions at Osmania University witness dip||HYDERABAD: The spread of Covid-19 has severely affected admissions of foreign students at Osmania University (OU), which was once a sought after destination for international students. The university had called for applications for the academic year 2021-22 from April 6. Last year, the university had 249 foreign admissions as against 370 during pre-Covid-19 times. With the educational institutions shut and classes still continuing online due to the second wave of Covid-19, the university authorities are apprehensive of the number of applications that they will receive from international students this year. “The impact of Covid-19 has been very significant on foreign students. With the second wave setting in, we are slightly apprehensive about the number of applications. Nonetheless, we have received 168 applications from foreign students so far. We have reached to embassies seeking support and relaxations for foreign students. We are hopeful that the numbers will be better than last year,” said GB Reddy, director, foreign relations, OU.  The university has received majority of applications from Afro-Asian countries. “We have a large number of applications from Afghanistan, Tanzania, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya etc. We receive many students through Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). This year too, we are expecting large number of students to come through ICCR,” said Reddy. Following nationwide lockdown, the university had introduced online classes last year and even conducted exams and declared results online. While the university intends to continue the same initiative this year too, it has also permitted students to directly apply through the ICCR’s admission to alumni portal. “We have an advisory committee meeting soon where we will decide if any new initiative is to be introduced. Online payments, admissions and exams shall continue. While we enhance the fee by 10% every year, we have decided not to increase it this year due to the pandemic,” said Reddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/foreign-admissions-at-ou-witness-dip/articleshow/82010370.cms||Preeti Biswas
---||Chennai||Now, check in for a daycation||Chennai: The last year has been tough on Sathya Rajeev who, like many others, has had to juggle a demanding WFH routine with domestic chores and her children’s online classes. With young and old alike to care for, and no possibility of going on a vacation, the 38-year-old recently opted for something that would help her relax, even while accommodating the needs of her family — a daycation."It’s not possible for all of us to have even a staycation as my in-laws are old and don’t want to step out as the pandemic is still on. So three of us friends, who were all desperate for a break decided to pamper ourselves and took a daycation. We checked into a hotel, had a lavish breakfast, chilled, got our hair done and spent a relaxing day together," says Sathya, an HR manager. "And late in the evening, we went back home to our families. It was fun and relaxing as we were meeting up after almost a year."The pandemic has popularised many a travel trend. Once the lockdown eased and hotels opened up, workcations and staycations became the norm, as people who had been cooped up indoors for months sought some downtime outside the four walls of their homes. And now, city hotels are also offering daycations for those who need a short break and some pampering to unwind."We began offering staycations once we opened up after the lockdown. Then we realised that there are some people who just want to spend a day out and not stay the night, so we began offering a daycation package," says Vikram Cotah, CEO, GRT Hotels & Resorts.So, guests can check in, have a buffet breakfast and lunch at the restaurant, have a drink, use the pool and also have a spa treatment before leaving in the evening. "We also give them a day use room for three hours and there is a 25% to 30% offer also now on the package," says Cotah, adding that it’s also more affordable than staying overnight. "It’s popular as families or groups of friends can come relax."Taj Clubhouse has also begun offering daycations. "Lot of people want to come and work in a quiet place with some privacy or just relax without having to stay the night," says Sivaguru J, reservation manager. "So guests can check in by 9am and check out by 8pm. We offer superior and deluxe rooms, with or without breakfast. And they can enjoy any of the facilities the hotel offers."Park Hyatt Chennai reintroduced its daycation packages in early February. "Once the pool and spa became operational, we began offering it," says Meena Rewari, director sales and marketing, Park Hyatt Chennai, adding that the packages can be customised. "Some people just want to lounge by the pool and have a massage, others are more focussed on food, so we can tailor it to their requirements. Most people just want to chill."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/now-check-in-for-a-daycation/articleshow/82010694.cms||Priya Menon

We are part of India and it is our identity. The BJP in Goa is conspiring to finish off this identity. They want to make casinos our identity,” said former long-time RSS chief of Goa and now BBSM convenor Subhash Velingkar. He demanded that the state should also allow new Konkani and Marathi medium primary schools to be established. Velingkar said that the grants of Rs 400 per student announced for unaided Konkani and Marathi schools is not being paid currently by the state government. BBSM has demanded that these grants be paid with retrospective effect to such schools. “Former CM Manohar Parrikar and the current CM Pramod Sawant have admitted in the state assembly that Konkani and Marathi schools have shut down by hundreds during their term. During the BJP government’s term itself, over 400 Konkani and Marathi schools have shut down in the state,” said Velingkar. He said new Konkani and Marathi schools should be allowed to be set up by private organisations, who have applied for the same, to fill the void left by closure of government schools offering education in these languages. Velingkar said that if Konkani and Marathi schools continue to shut down at the same rate with no permission given to start new institutions in these languages, it will mean the end of regional language education in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bbsm-relaunches-protest-campaign-over-moi-issue/articleshow/82009964.cms||---

In a letter to Sawant, Khaunte has demanded that the state introduce stringent standard operating procedures (SOPs) and tighter controls, including Covid negative certificates for those entering the state. The former revenue minister said that the prioritisation of the state’s economy is taking a toll on public health. “A strategy change is required and much needs to be done on a war-footing to prevent further suffering and deaths from the second wave,” said Khaunte. “The sudden increase in fresh cases is seriously frightening. Goa cannot afford any further delays to rethink the situation, and therefore, imposition of more effective SOPs with tighter control is a must.” tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/jump-in-new-cases-scary-introduce-stringent-sops-khaunte-to-sawant/articleshow/82009968.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Pilgrims using alternate routes to dodge RT-PCR report norm?||HARIDWAR/DEHRADUN: As pilgrim turnout rises steadily in Haridwar in the run-up to the two shahi snans (scheduled on April 12 and 14), instances of pilgrims using alternate routes via villages and forests to dodge the police at border check-points are coming to light. With RT-PCR reports being checked before allowing entry, locals say that many pilgrims are taking arterial routes from within villages and even jungles to enter Haridwar from neighbouring states like Uttar Pradesh. Some of the routes being used are on Narsan border and Chhutmalpur-Bhagwanpur border. Further, locals say that there have been instances in the past few days of people without RT-PCR reports even trying to bribe police officials to let them enter. “There are some alternate routes which bypass the police check posts on the Narsan border. Despite these roads being in very bad shape, the pilgrims are taking them in order to reach Haridwar without being stopped,” said local resident Aman Singh. “Most of these routes start from the villages of Uttar Pradesh located at the Narsan and Chhutmalpur borders in Muzaffarnagar and Saharanpur districts respectively. Similarly, there is another alternate route from Chidiyapur border which is commonly called east canal route. Most of these routes are known only to local drivers and villagers,” he added. However, police said their teams have been deployed on all the alternative routes. SSP Haridwar Senthil Avoodai Krishna Raj S told TOI, “District police and Kumbh mela police have been jointly deployed on Narsan, Bhagwanpur and Chidiyapur borders as well as all the alternatives routes on all three main borders where registration papers along with Covid-19-negative reports are being checked." He added that “police and health department teams are also conducting random checking at parking places in the Kumbh mela area where pilgrims are coming to park their vehicles.” “People who are caught without negative corona reports are tested on the spot. Random checks are also being done in hotels and dharamshalas of Kumbh area,” he said. It is estimated that there are around 12,000 to 15,000 people entering Haridwar daily. Police claimed that they are returning around 3,000 people from the borders every day and have increased presence on arterial routes as well. Meanwhile, speaking to TOI, director general of police (DGP) Ashok Kumar said, “There are around 15000 police personnel, along with over 5000 volunteers, deployed in Haridwar for the Kumbh Mela. Police personnel are manning the borders diligently and helping the health department staff to check the people entering Haridwar.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kumbh-pilgrims-trying-to-dodge-rt-pcr-report-requirement-at-haridwar-borders-by-taking-alternate-routes-through-villages-and-forests/articleshow/82009151.cms||MS Nawaz

During a meeting at BRD Medical College, the CM gave instructions to ensure sufficient supply of oxygen and sanitizer and hygienic conditions at hospitals. He said half of the 108 ambulances should be reserved for Covid-19 patients. The CM was to hold janata darbar at Gorakhnath temple in the morning but it was put off due to coronavirus spread. Yogi asked the officials concerned to ensure stern action in case of any irregularity in conduct of free antigen and RT-PCR tests at district hospitals and asked them to determine the price of tests at private hospitals. “RT-PCR tests should be increased and dedicated Covid hospitals should be ensured in every district. CCTV cameras should be installed at hospitals so that a vigil can be kept on activities. Masks are a must and crowding should be stopped at public places,” he said, adding that not more than 200 people should be allowed in public gatherings in the open and not more than 100 be permitted in a closed room during day time. He asked officials to increase contact tracing with 100% Covid-19 tests. “Impose night curfew if more than 500 active cases of coronavirus are found in any district. If even a single case is found in a rural area, the entire village must be sanitised. Weddings and celebrations are allowed till 10 pm,” Yogi added. The CM said proper arrangements should be made for special vaccination drive, Teeka Utsav, scheduled to be held between April 11 and 14. Covid help desks should be set up at all government and private offices/institutions, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-ensure-testing-availability-of-beds-medicines-at-hosps/articleshow/82010365.cms||Arjumand Bano

He also said that due to the poor response to vaccination drives, around 2% of vaccines have been wasted. Salkar said states should have been given some leverage to decide that if people in the age group of 45 years failed to get themselves vaccinated, then people aged 35 and above should have been called for vaccination to avoid wastage. While praising the state government for starting vaccination drives even at the village level, Salkar said that the daily vaccination target should be around 8,000 to 10,000 instead of the current daily of around 4,500. “Quick vaccination is very important. The earlier it is completed, the better it is,” he said Reminding people that it is possible to contract Covid-19 even after getting vaccinated, he said the advantage of getting vaccinated is the severity would be less.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/higher-jab-targets-will-curb-spread/articleshow/82009969.cms||---

This is for "not discharging their duty with accountability and transparency", said an order passed by Information Commissioner S Muthuraj on March 25.Muthuraj wrote to the state chief secretary recommending action against Surjit K Chaudhary, Vibhu Nayar, Kakarla Usha, D Jagannathan, K Srinivasan, K Nandakumar, S Jayandhi, N Venkatesh and G Latha.When TOI asked chief secretary Rajeev Ranjan about the order, he said: "We will examine and take appropriate suitable action after getting the recommendations." However, officials said information commission do not have powers to recommend compulsory retirement of IAS officers. "This is a very, very weird order. It was passed without any application of mind," said Surjit Chaudhary, who was the chairman of TRB from 2011 to 2014. The board has recruited around 40,000 teachers during his tenure and he retired five years ago."The information commission can recommend disciplinary action against only the information officers designated as per the RTI act if they do not provide information. Further, they cannot prescribe the punishment as it is the prerogative of the state government. In the case of IAS officers, the disciplinary authority is the Government of India," he said."Despite holding powers, the chairmen failed to correct the wrong questions and answer keys and did not provide relief to the candidates. Due to the lack of accountability from the subject experts, professors, and higher officials of TRB, the recruitment exams are cancelled and recruitment could not be completed, thereby wasting the resources of the government," Muthuraj said in his order.Further, the commission as per the RTI act section 19 (8) (a) (ii) has added the TRB chairman as the public information officer and directed him to provide the information sought by the petitioner within 20 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/info-panel-recommends-compulsory-retirement-to-9-ias-officers/articleshow/82010697.cms||---
---||Chennai||Parkinson's Day: ‘I fought in Kargil, can battle my Parkinson’s too’||CHENNAI: It was in October 2020 that Thiruvengadam K S was diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease (PD), a brain disorder that leads to stiffness and difficulty in walking and maintaining balance. A decorated Kargil war veteran, Thiruvengadam recounts, “I developed a shiver in my jaw and once dozed off at the wheel on my drive to work.” Thiruvengadam, who manages industrial relations of a company, pegged it to increased stress on account of the spiralling labour union issues he was mediating, aggravated by the lockdown. “Discovering in the midst of the pandemic that I had PD was a blow to my mental state. I became more anxious. But my doctor counselled me through it, and today I have a renewed passion for life,” says Thiruvengadam, who has drawn up what he calls a battle plan to defeat his disease. His first line of action was creating a rooftop garden where he works for a couple of hours before going to office, and which he believes puts him in a positive frame of mind. Next, he bought some farmland, which he cultivates on Sundays. He has also begun breeding native dogs. “I am aggressive with my physiotherapy and mediation, regular with my medication and I can feel myself winning this war,” he says.  Neurologist Dr Vikash Agarwal, who worked with Thiruvengadam, says the PD prevalence is 1% in those above the age of 65. “While it can be managed with medication and exercise, we found isolation and restrictions of movement on account of Covid-19 resulted in a worsening of the condition in 30% of our patients,” says the PD specialist at Gleneagles Global Health City. “PD patients are also worried about whether they can take the vaccine. And the answer is yes.” PD is associated with several neuro-psychological issues, says Dr Agarwal. “Symptoms are anxiety, fear, depression and mood and sleep disorders. The fear of Covid-19 worsens this,” says Dr Agarwal. Early diagnosis, exercise, physiotherapy, a good support system and the right medical intervention can help manage PD, he says. Sudha Meiyappan, who founded the Chennai-based Parivarthan for Parkinson’s, says the support group was forced to move online during the lockdown. “As a result we could increase the frequency of meetings as well as size of the group. So people with PD began interacting virtually with members they had never met before because of geographical restrictions of physical meetings,” says Sudha. Speech therapy, physiotherapy and yoga sessions have also moved online. “But what I observed was that the lockdown didn’t change the lives of those with PD since they usually hesitate to venture out. Isolation unfortunately is the way of life for a majority of them, which is what we are trying to change through the group,” she says. “I’ve realised that though PD is a disease of the brain, the battle against it is in the mind,” says Thiruvengadam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/i-fought-in-kargil-can-battle-my-parkinsons-too/articleshow/82010696.cms||Kamini Mathai

He was addressing the release event of a handbook on ODR, developed by Agami and Omidyar India. “ODR has the potential to decentralise, diversify, democratise, and disentangle the justice delivery mechanism,” he said. He said Covid-19 has impacted the way courts operated — with physical hearings giving way to virtual ones. He emphasised that ODR is the need of the hour, given the string of benefits. He said the ODR handbook notes that traditional litigation in India can be time consuming. ODR can provide a helping hand by limiting kinds of disputes that often come to courts in first place. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/online-dispute-resolution-vital-says-sc-judge/articleshow/82010928.cms||---

---||Agra||UP: Man booked for forced conversion of wife after two years||AGRA: After two years of marriage, a woman, 23, has accused her husband and his two sisters of “forcefully converting” her days ago in Aligarh. In all that time, the woman said, she “never realised” he was Muslim, never met her in-laws and was able to retain her maiden name. The Muslim man, 25, and his sisters were booked on Friday night under UP’s anti-conversion law. The woman, Puja Soni, is from Chhattisgarh’s Ranva Haid Gamariya village. She said she had married a man “she believed” was called Ashok Rajput in March 2019 in Delhi, where she works at a hospital. She got to know the man, who worked as a plumber, after he “got her number” and they started talking over the phone. They met in Sikandarpur and fell in love. “We got married in a temple,” she said. And they started living in Noida. It is not clear if the man changed his identity on paper, too, and altered his way of life in the two years she said she “did not realise” he was Muslim. In her complaint to police, she said, “On February 7 this year, we had a daughter. On March 22, he took me to his home at Rait village in Aligarh. There, I found out his name was Afzal Khan. I was forced to read the namaaz and stopped from offering my prayers.” She added, “On April 8, they took my daughter away from me. Then, they converted me forcefully and renamed me ‘Alna’.” She alleged they drove her out of the house and dropped her off at Mathura. Before the FIR was registered, former BJP mayor Shakuntala Bharti got to the police station and took down answers to questions she asked — “Did he beat you up?”, “Behla fusla ke laya (Did he mislead you into marrying him)?” SHO Abhay Kumar Sharma of the Lodha police station, where the FIR was registered, said, “Ashok Rajput alias Afzal Khan has been booked under The Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance and Section 323 of the IPC (voluntarily causing hurt) along with his sisters.” The FIR said he had been booked under Section 5(3) of the anti-conversion law, which is for prosecuting second offences under the ordinance. When TOI asked why a case had been registered for a second offence, SP (city) Kuldeep Singh Gunawat said it was a typo: “They have been booked under sections 3 (prohibition of conversion of religion) and 5 (punishment for forced conversion) of the law, and not Subsection 3 of Section 5. It was a typographical error.” No arrest has been made so far. The woman is in police custody and her statement will be registered in court under Section 164 of the CrPC on Monday. UP ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar told TOI 32 FIRs have been registered under the state’s anti-conversion law since it came into effect in November last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/2-yrs-after-marriage-man-2-sisters-booked-for-forced-conversion-in-up/articleshow/82008450.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Denying that fact that some hospitals are being dedicated only for treating Covid 19 patients, he said all hospitals in the state, including district hospitals, will continue to treat non-Covid cases as well. “Hospitals will treat cases such as deliveries, trauma cases, out-patients in separate blocks apart from giving vaccines,” the minister said.

---||Dehradun||Vaccine crisis? Stocks of Covid-19 shots run out at many places in Uttarakhand||Dehradun/Mussoorie: A vaccine crisis seems to be looming large in the state, with health officials saying on Saturday that they “just had around 70,000 vaccines left in stock which will be exhausted during the day (on Saturday) and there will be no vaccination possible on Sunday.” Even though the department is expecting a fresh tranche of 1.3 lakh doses, that, too, is expected to last for only two days, as the state is vaccinating at least 60,000 people daily. According to health department data, till April 10, the state had received 13,23,830 doses of Covid-19 vaccine, of which over 12.5 lakh doses have been utilised. This includes 2.4% wastage. All the vaccines are Serum Institute’s Covishield. Meanwhile, the shortage of the vaccine left many people who were looking to get a jab, disappointed. Those who had registered themselves for the vaccine were intimated by hospitals to come later. At the Landour Community Hospital in Mussoorie, a hospital staffer said that they had “only about 25 to 30 doses left.” “We will not be able to conduct vaccination unless we get fresh stock.” In Dehradun, vaccinations were stopped at Nagar Nigam and in most of the private hospitals in the city as well. Meanwhile, Dr Saroj Naithani, director of National Health Mission, Uttarakhand said that the situation is likely to improve after the freh tranche of doses arrives. “We are expecting to get around 1.3 lakh doses of the vaccine on Sunday,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/vaccine-crisis-stocks-of-covid-19-shots-run-out-at-many-places-in-uttarakhand/articleshow/82009188.cms||Ishita Mishra

This has become possible after the district received a fresh stock of 80,000 doses of the vaccine late Saturday evening.Nodal officer of vaccines in the district, Tirath Lal, said: “The fresh stock of the vaccine landed at Varanasi airport by Saturday noon from where it was dispatched for different neighbouring districts, including Prayagraj. The vehicle carrying 80,000 doses would be arriving here by late evening and the ‘festival’ would commence in the district from Sunday at all 97 vaccination centres.”Earlier in the day, the health department conducted vaccination at five centres in the city including MLN medical college campus, Colvin hospital, Beli hospital, Duffrin hospital and Railway hospital.Earlier, stock of Covid-19 vaccine was running low in Prayagraj district adversely affecting the vaccination process. In a bid to control the use of available stock, vaccination was stopped at many rural primary health centres of the district and was being done only at community health centres (CHC).To effectively take on Covid-19 outbreak, vaccination was started at 61 PHCs of the district in March. However, on Wednesday, vaccinations at these centres were stopped till further notice and only 20 CHCs were administering the vaccine.On Saturday, the vaccination process commenced at five centres of the city and all these centres witnessed heavy rush of denizens which had turned up at the centres to get themselves vaccinated.Because of the heavy rush, the stock of vaccines was over by noon at almost all the centres, few of which continued with the second dose of the vaccine only. Because of this, many people had to return empty handed. At a few centres, people were seen arguing with the staff.At one of the centres, 75-year-old Rajkumari Devi of Alopibagh looked disheartened as she could not get vaccinated. She said she had somehow climbed down three floors of her house to get vaccinated. “Now, I am told there is no vaccine and I have to return. I will not come to get vaccinated again,” she said.Like her, Girdharlal, Sohan, Raju and Kajal were also annoyed for not being vaccinated. They were complaining that the government should have made proper arrangements for the vaccine as the government is fully aware of the situation.The nodal officer of the vaccination said, “We have done all the micro level preparations for starting the vaccination festival from Sunday and it would be our efforts to see to it that more and more eligible people are vaccinated in these four days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/situation-eases-as-city-gets-fresh-stock-of-80k-covid-vaccines/articleshow/82009976.cms||---

Pandey informed that he received a phone call from an unknown number in the evening on the day of the verdict in favour of the petitioners. The caller threatened Pandey that he would be killed. Pandey called senior police officials and intimated them about the threat verbally following which ACP Awadhesh Pandey met him and collected all the details. The ACP said that the phone number is being traced and investigation is on. The police officials have deputed two constables at Pandey’s residence for his security. Harihar Pandey, Pandit Somnath Vyas and Ramrang Sharma had filed the first petition in the case on behalf of Swayambhu Jyotirlinga Bhagwan Vishweshwar in a civil court in 1991. Pandey is now the only surviving petitioner among the three. Advocate Vijay Shankar Rastogi as the ‘next friend’ of Swayambhu Jyotirlinga Bhagwan Vishweshwar had filed an application in the court of civil judge in December 2019, requesting for the survey of the entire Gyanvapi compound by ASI. After hearing the case, the court of civil judge (senior division) Fast Track, Ashutosh Tiwari gave verdict on April 8 and directed the Director General of ASI to conduct a comprehensive archaeological physical survey of the entire settlement plot of Gyanvapi compound.

They will be selected based on their cumulative grade points average (CGPA) in the first-year exams and their parents’ annual income. The announcement comes after Dun and Bradstreet Technologies and Data Services Private Limitedgave Rs 90 lakh to the university under its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative. “Students with a CGPA above 7 and their parents’ annual income below Rs 4 lakh will get the scholarship from the second year to the final year. The amount would be useful to students whose parents have lost their livelihood due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” said S Iniyan, director of Centre for University-Industry Collaboration (CUIC), Anna University. While those in circuit branches and the mechanical branch will be eligible for the scholarship, they should not have any current arrears. “The annual tuition fees for students in Anna University’s four campuses as well as its constituent colleges are very low and students can use the remaining amount to buy gadgets to attend online classes,” said T Kalaiselvan, additional director of the centre. CUIC will ask university departments and constituent colleges to sponsor students for scholarship. If more than 100 students applied for the scholarship, the university would share the list with the company and they will select the candidates, he added.

Luckily I wasn’t injured,” said T Prithviraj, a shopkeeper and resident of the colony. Prithviraj said that he usually avoids the path and walks only during non-peak hours. “If we don’t use this turn we have to travel at least half a kilometer to take a U-turn, and the ones going to Arcot Road have to travel more than two kilometres to take a U-turn. This is the most convenient path for us,” said Raj Kumar R, a motorist.Residents said several accidents take place at the turning point due to high vehicle and pedestrian movement. “It is very narrow and vehicles pass from both sides, there have been several instances of motorcycles ramming each other. We have also asked the policemen to create one more turn along the road so vehicles can pass without hassle, and the chances of accidents can also be avoided. This is completely chaotic,” said Raj Kumar.Traffic policemen said they only allow motorcycles to take the turn and ensure that pedestrians are also able to pass by, especially in the evening rush hour. “We do not let cars and bigger vehicles take a turn here. We barricade it so that other vehicles cannot pass by,” said a policeman.Motorists said the policemen are only stationed at the spot between 6pm and 8pm, after which people tend to remove the barricades and all vehicles take over the road, inconveniencing others. “If the authorities create another turn around half a kilometre away the issues will be resolved. There will not be such traffic jam,” said S Kannan, a shopkeeper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/kodambakkam-u-turn-puts-pedestrians-at-risk/articleshow/82010727.cms||---

While senior citizens are still reluctant to receive the jab, the village-level drive offers a new hope at enhancing vaccination, officials said. “The response to the drive has been very good,” said district immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar. The new locations were in addition to the regular session sites. In every village except one, DHS managed to administer over 100 doses of the vaccine, Borkar said. Since the state began its drive, response has been slow. Only recently, when the jab was offered to all those above 45, did it pick up. Officials said that senior citizens continue to defer their plans to get the vaccine amid fears of adverse effects. For instance, a 65-year-old Siolim resident told TOI that he hasn’t gotten the jab since he’s diabetic. “What if I fall sick after vaccination?” he said. “My neighbour got a fever after she got the jab.” Doctors, however, say that a mild fever is quite common after the vaccine, and strongly recommend that diabetics (and those with other comorbidities) get the jab without delay. It is in this backdrop that the DHS decided to take the drive to the villages, as senior citizens otherwise refuse to come forward. “We expect the numbers to increase in the coming days, as people will come forward by setting aside their inhibitions,” said Borkar. While the village-level vaccination effort will be conducted on Monday, Tika Utsav, the mass vaccination drive announced by PM Narendra Modi, starts on Sunday and ends on Wednesday. Health minister Vishwajit Rane said that the village-level drive will first be held in villages that have the required infrastructure, and then move to other villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-takes-vaccine-programme-to-7-villages-administers-7741-doses/articleshow/82009980.cms||---

While the MTC terminus was already part of the mofussil bus terminus, the depot for city fleet was added later. Construction of MTC depot began four months ago, according to official sources at the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) which is building the bus terminus at Kilambakkam near Vandalur. At least 10 MTC buses can be serviced at a given time.  “The construction of depots will be completed in two months,” a CMDA source said, adding that construction of the MTC bus terminus at Kilambakkam is almost complete. The MTC bus terminus at Kilambakkam comprises 11 platforms setup in an area of 36,200sqft. According to MTC sources, the state-owned transport corporation asked the CMDA to earmark space at Kilambakkam for maintenance of their buses. Noting that the capacity of the depot allowed for maintenance of 40-50 buses, sources said some buses routes departing from Tambaram and Vandalur would be extended till Kilambakkam for convenience of passengers alighting at Kilambakkam. “When we extend these buses, a depot was necessary for their maintenance,” a senior MTC official said. The MTC has sought a similar space at Thirumazhisai mofussil terminus for the west-bound buses from the CMDA. All mofussil buses that are now departing from CMBT at Koyambedu would be shifted to Kilambakkam and Thirumazhisai after the two terminuses are open for public use. MTC does not have dedicated depots for its fleet at CMBT at Koyambedu and Madhavaram mofussil bus terminus, though it operates buses to different parts of Chennai and suburbs from the two terminuses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/kilambakkam-bus-terminus-for-mtc-too/articleshow/82010721.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss
---||Lucknow||UP Police image has improved in last four years: Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath handed over appointment letters to 66 probationers who have cleared their Provincial Civil Service (PCS) exam and will undergo training and be appointed as Deputy Superintendent of Police (DySP) in UP Police. This is the first time that candidates selected for DySP post were given their appointment letters by a chief minister. Addressing the probationers, the CM expressed happiness at the changing image of UP Police. “Before 2017, police had a poor reputation, but over the past four years the efficiency and professional commitment of the police force has been such that now when elections are held in other states, they ask for UP Police personnel,” he said. Disapproving the irregularities in police recruitment process earlier, the CM said merit was ignored till 2017, the impact of which was felt by several generations. Now, the selections by UP Public Service Commission are completely transparent and fair, he added. “Nobody can raise questions on the selection process now. The role of UP Police was praised during the Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas when 7,000 delegates had arrived from 76 countries. Voting at 1,63,000 polling booths for 80 Lok Sabha seats in 2019 was held peacefully. The Kumbh, which was attended by 25 crore people, saw extremely high standards of policing,” the CM said, adding that the government was working on police reforms. The CM told the probationers that if they work honestly, they could even rise to the post of inspector general (IG). The chief minister greeted the probationers on the commencement of their training and alerted them about the challenges ahead in their work life. “Your way of working will decide the course of your life. If you work honestly and diligently, you could even become IG by the time you reach the age of additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi. But if your work and conduct raise questions on your integrity then you will lose direction. Recently, three senior police officials were given compulsory retirement. You should maintain discipline. The government will give you opportunities to prove yourselves and you have to do it by working with diligence,” the chief minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-up-police-image-has-improved-in-last-four-years/articleshow/82010395.cms||---

On Friday, the directorate of health services received reports of four out of 15 samples sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune for genome sequencing. “Reports of 11 samples are still awaited, and we have received results of four. It means four strains may be circulating but actively for prevention and control of the virus, the strategy remains the same,” said Dr Utkarsh Betodkar, state epidemiologist. A batch of 15 samples was sent for testing in the first week of March. Four samples that were tested for genome sequencing at NIV have shown different strains – from the UK, US, double-mutant from Maharashtra, and the original one. He said they have checked on four people whose samples were tested positive. All four have been long recovered and none in their families have tested positive since then. “We don’t need to do anything on that account. The results, however, will help in surveillance,” he said. The four positive samples though indicate that those strains may be in circulation, he said the government of India has told that the vaccines used “offers protection against all mutant strains”. “The percentage might be different, but it should work,” he said, replying to a query on what could be the possible implications of new strains if at all they are circulating. He said there has been no direct study to show that the vaccines in use in the country will not offer protection against the new strains. North Goa district hospital send another batch of samples drawn from the community pool for genome sequencing to NIV next week. The Goa Medical College (GMC) has also been asked to send randomly drawn samples for testing as part of routine surveillance as instructed by the Indian Council Medical Research (ICMR), he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/despite-4-strains-no-change-in-strategy-to-manage-virus/articleshow/82009978.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

On Friday, the victim, Sayantan Dasgupta (47) from Powai, got a call from a Sachin Sharma who said he needed to rent a flat in Kolkata where he was posted to move in his family. The man told Dasgupta that he is transferring Rs 50,000 through G Pay as the deposit amount. “I had barely accepted the transaction request sent by the fraudster and money got debited instead of being credited. The second transaction was done automatically without any PIN authentication,” said Dasgupta. Two transactions of Rs49,000 were carried out from his bank account within a minute. He then blocked the account and filed a police complaint. “The scamster got the victim’s contact details from a housing portal. This is a new modus operandi of many online fraudsters who collect database of property owners and dupe them,” said a Powai police station officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-loses-rs-98k-to-e-fraudster-posing-as-potential-tenant/articleshow/82009988.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

The case was lodged on the basis of 195 criminal cases lodged against Atiq, his son Umar Ahmad and their associates. The case was lodged under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. ED officials said all benami (anonymous) properties acquired by Atiq, his aides and family members would be attached. Atiq, a former MP and MLA is lodged in Sabarmati jail since June 2019. An ED official said so far Atiq’s properties worth Rs 245 crore have been confiscated by district administration and UP Police. “We will be probing the properties acquired forcefully by the don and also the money he got through illegal means,” the official added. Sources in the ED said they have traced 16 real estate companies which are directly or indirectly related to Atiq and his son. “We have taken complete dossier of cases of Atiq Ahmad from the UP Police and will conduct a threadbare probe,” said a senior ED official. ED will also probe the money trail in the FIR registered by CBI against Atiq and his son on the charges of extortion, assault, kidnapping of businessman Mohit Jaiswal in June 2019. Mohit Jaiswal, a property dealer in Lucknow, was kidnapped by Atiq’s aides and taken to Deoria jail where the don was then lodged. Jaiswal was allegedly assaulted in jail by Atiq and later dumped him near his house in Lucknow. Later Jaiswal moved the Supreme Court which ordered a CBI probe in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ed-files-money-laundering-case-against-jailed-don-atiq/articleshow/82010401.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||IIIT-Hyderabad designs game which simulates Covid pandemic||HYDERABAD: The International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIIT-H) designed a trade game on Covid-19 with a learning objective to acquaint children with different resources used to curb the spread of the virus and efficient ways to utilise them. Following requirements of Agastya Foundation, a non-profit organization, Prof Kavita Vemuri, along with an alumni startup GoLive, developed and designed a trade-game titled ‘World beats the virus together’. “Agastya wanted to convey the complexities in real life to children via this game. When they shared the specifications with me, I started thinking about the design. I wanted children to understand the nuances and play intuitively without making it too complex to play,” said Vemuri. The game has five fictitious countries, each possessing a set number of resources such as test kits, doctors, medicines, ICU beds and ventilators. Countries are randomly assigned to teams consisting of three to four members. Over the course of 12 rounds representing 12 months of a year, the teams work together to beat the coronavirus by talking and creating allies, cooperation and empathy. “The idea behind the game was to mirror reality where there is uncertainty in virus caseload and to see not only how children make decisions but also whether they understand the concept of working together as global citizens,” Vemuri added. In the end, a winner is declared based on the maximum trade indulged in as well as the number of rounds survived and not on the profits made. For example, if a country does not trade at all – that is, share its resources, they get fewer trade points. “It was after playing the game that I realised how complicated the situation actually is. Because we don’t know much about the virus, we have to work with what we have. There are multiple stages of Covid-19. To determine who to prioritise in this kind of a situation is a very difficult process, especially for a country like India with a population of 1.3 billion,” said R Hiranmayi, a 15-year-old girl who played the game.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iiit-h-designs-game-which-simulates-covid-pandemic/articleshow/82010405.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||One of India’s richest politicians now in search of a party||Robin David tries to decipher the many sides of Konda Vishweshwar ReddyMoney begets power and power begets more money. Or at least that is what traditional logic says. But one of India’s richest politicians – Konda Vishweshwar Reddy – is now without power. More specifically, he is without a political party. He had joined TRS in 2013 and left it in 2018. He then joined Congress and left it last month. He is now hoping to create a new political party in Telangana. Reddy was the richest MP in the country between 2014 and 2019 with assets worth Rs 528 crore after he won from Chevella in Telangana. He was the second richest candidate in the 2019 elections with Rs 895 crore. He lost the election that year on a Congress ticket. He has political legacy too. He is the grandson of Konda Venkata Ranga Reddy, former deputy chief minister of united Andhra Pradesh -- the man Ranga Reddy district has been named after. Today, Reddy is living in a world of contradictions. He is in the process of bringing small regional outfits together onto one platform to create one mega regional party in Telangana. But he himself does not want to be involved in state politics. He prefers being Telangana’s representative in Lok Sabha. He does not mind being called the ‘richest MP’ and ‘richest candidate’, but cringes when called a rich businessman. Husband of Apollo Hospitals Joint Managing Director, Sangita Reddy, he says, “I would like to be known as an academic, entrepreneur and researcher instead.” But being called a rich politician was beneficial in some ways. “Initially, I was concerned (about being called rich). They would think, arey, ine paise wala hai. Ine aam admi ki samaysa jaante nai, and all that,” he says with a touch of Hyderabadi Dakhni. “But to my shock, it helped me a lot (in 2014). People started saying he is a paisewala. He does not need to take bribes and is a potential winner. And by the way, I am the richest only on paper. Almost every MP in Telangana is richer than me. These people can buy me over 20-30 times. I pay taxes, they don’t.” The man who has a number of patents and copyrights to his name, adds that even at this moment he is working on a unique rice transplanting machine. State politics is like “wrestling with the pig in the mud” for him and accepts that perhaps he is not cut out for it. “MP electoral politics is somewhat cleaner than assembly politics,” he insists. “In Parliament, no one throws chappals at each other. The level of politics is lower in assemblies. And the way Parliament conducts everything, even the budget, is very different.” According to him, in Parliament there would be a marginal difference between what the finance minister allocates for a particular section and what is actually given. “In states it is just the opposite. There will be a 90% discrepancy. Also, you need to be a bit of a street fighter in state politics. I am different. I entered politics in 2013 when I was 53. So, I am often thinking of things other than politics.” Despite his dislike for the rough and tumble of state politics, he has taken the initiative of bringing all small, regional parties in Telangana on one platform. This includes Telangana Jana Samithi, Telangana Inti Party and independents like Teenmar Mallana. He says that a unified regional outfit could take on TRS effectively and would not mind joining hands with BJP or Congress in the future. On why he wants to form a new regional outfit; he says it would be supple and effective. “In any national party, decisions have to go to the central leadership. By the time they come back, the situation has changed. For instance, Congress. By the time they understand the problem, report it to the central leadership, find a solution and discuss it democratically, someone like KCR has changed things.” Having met some of the regional party chiefs, Reddy understands the frustrations and limitations. “Some of them are frustrated because they have been trying for a while. I can see minds opening to this new idea. All of them have been thinking of joining hands for a new regional outfit. I have just taken the initiative. We will also bring together some people from Congress and TRS. They are looking for a viable alternative.” He adds that he had a great life in TRS as an MP and even had friends across all parties in Parliament. But he says he was disillusioned with chief minister, K Chandrasekhar Rao, and his son and minister, K T Rama Rao, as the state did not develop the way it was promised. On the other hand, the Congress was an effective opposition, he felt. “The state has a Rs 4 lakh crore loan and still the same problems.” “The BJP is an option I am actively exploring,” he candidly accepts. “But joining that party would be unjust to my cause if I blindly jump in. Unified regional party is my cause. In the long run we may have to join hands with the Congress or BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/one-of-indias-richest-politicians-now-in-search-of-a-party/articleshow/82010130.cms||---
---||Pune||Officials to hold parleys with traders today: Dy CM||Pune: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Saturday directed divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao, and Pune’s municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar and police commissioner Amitabh Gupta to hold parleys on Sunday with the representatives of traders of non-essential shops, protesting against the closure of establishments till April 30. “These officers will hold a meeting with the federation’s leaders. They will take them into confidence and inform them about the situation the city is facing and the need for their co-operation. I feel if you convey the seriousness of the issue, the federation will respond positively,” said Ajit Pawar at the weekly Covid-19 review meeting at the Council Hall. He said the officers would hold discussions and try to convince the traders’ representatives about how essential it was to “break the chain” of transmission. “We are hoping that the discussions will yield positive results and they (traders) will understand,” he said. Ajit Pawar said he was aware that the citizens were losing their patience with the lockdowns but giving up the fight against Covid-19 was not an option. He said the government needed support from the residents at this juncture. He also said Puneites were responding well to the weekend lockdown and other restrictions. Ajit Pawar said the infection rate was higher during the second wave of Covid-19 but the severity was lower. He said the administration was ready with the infrastructure and the Centre was supporting the state in this regard with ventilators, oxygen supply and vaccines. He said the central team under nodal officer Kunal Kumar had discussed with him the steps to ramp up infrastructure in the state and the district. The deputy chief minister expressed hope that the positivity rate of Pune district would dip as had been seen in other districts such as Akola and Amravati, where the positivity rate had touched 25%. Appreciating the district’s performance so far on the vaccination front, Ajit Pawar said Union minister Prakash Javdekar, present in the district’s weekly Covid review meeting, assured that the Centre would ensure adequate vaccine supply to the state. The deputy chief minister said the district had covered 43% population in the age group of above 45.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/officials-to-hold-parleys-with-traders-today-dy-cm/articleshow/82009995.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Internal assessment for Std IX, XI pupils; no remarks on marksheet||MUMBAI: The state education department has asked state board-affiliated schools and junior colleges to set up a committee of subject teachers to evaluate students of classes IX and XI. In a circular, the department has directed that all students be promoted and that schools not mention ‘any other remarks’ on report cards. Guidelines issued by the state on Friday mentioned that schools and junior colleges can conduct assessments that do no require students to be physically present on the premises of the educational institute. “A committee of subject teachers from the school must discuss the assessment form and other criteria. Schools and junior colleges must give marks to students based on the assessment. Report cards must not have semester-wise breakup of scores, but instead mention performance as decided by the school,” said the circular. While schools can evaluate students, they can only use scores as an indicator for student performance and all students must be promoted to the next class. This year, all students of classes I to IX and XI from state board-affiliated schools will be promoted to the next class as most schools remained shut for most part of the year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. While the state is yet to make a decision regarding the board examination for classes X and XII, which are slated to begin later this month, the demand to postpone or cancel the exams continued to grow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-internal-assessment-for-std-ix-xi-pupils-no-remarks-on-marksheet/articleshow/82010439.cms||---

The announcement came hours after the BJP and Congress supported Dalit organisations raised objections over Akhilesh calling upon his cadre to celebrate the birth anniversary of Ambedkar as ‘Dalit Diwali’. “To further the idea of equality and justice to all sections of the society that was mooted by Baba Saheb Ambedkar, Samajwadi Party pledges to float a separate frontal organisation by the name of Baba Saheb Vahini at the district, state and national level on his birth anniversary on April 14,” he said. Earlier, responding to objections over his call to celebrate Ambedkar’s birth anniversary as ‘Dalit Diwali’, Yadav said there could be reservations over the name but there could not be any dispute over celebrating Ambedkar and his birth anniversary. “One may call it ‘Samvidhan Raksha Diwas’ or ‘Ambedkar Diwali’ but no one can question the desire to celebrate Ambedkar and his birth anniversary. Socialist ideologue Ram Manohar Lohia and Ambedkar had planned to work together for the uplift of the society and the fact is a part of our history. The BJP or the Congress should not have any problem if SP wants to celebrate Ambedkar,” Yadav said in response to a media query over objections raised by the BJP and the Congress over his call to celebrate the occasion as ‘Dalit Diwali’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/after-dalit-diwali-call-sp-to-launch-baba-saheb-vahini/articleshow/82010413.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: C-60 commando-turned-assistant inspector led rescue in Wadi hospital fire||NAGPUR: Assistant police inspector Ganeshkumar Fulkawar of Wadi police station, who was a C-60 commando in Maoist-affected Gadchiroli in the past, was at the forefront of the rescue operation in the devastating Wadi hospital fire on Friday. He, along with the fire brigade personnel, managed to evacuate at least nine critically-trapped patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Fulkawar, who had participated in three encounters against Maoists in Gadchiroli between 1997 and 2011, said he was initially blinded by the smoke and was unable to enter the ICU where patients had been trapped. “We hammered down a false plywood door towards the rear of the ICU and went inside. The water hose pipes were dragged inside too for dousing the flames. I ensured the glass windows of the passage were broken to allow the billowing smoke — which becomes a reason for choking deaths many times — leave the place,” he said. “I was ably assisted by two firemen as we helped the ICU patients wade through the blazing flames,” Fulkawar said. He added that patients from the third and fourth floors too were rescued by the joint team of police and fire brigade. Recruited as a constable in Gadchiroli in 1996, Fulkawar cleared MPSC examination to become an officer in 2011. Zonal DCP Noorul Hassan lauded the efforts of Fulkawar and the firemen.“Fulkawar and the firemen took several strategic decisions in the nick of time which led to rescue of more patients than the number of casualties, which could have been higher,” he said. Head constable Dinesh Tandulkar, who was admitted in the hospital after testing positive for Covid-19, turned saviour and evacuated two nursing staffers trapped inside the hospital. Tandulkar was admitted in the hospital a couple of days ago and was responding to treatment. Later, Tandulkar was admitted at a hospital in Hingna, said his fellow cop Vijay Khalatkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/c-60-commando-turned-asst-inspector-led-rescue-in-wadi-hosp-fire/articleshow/82009213.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Islamic scholar retracts his statement on ‘azaan’||MUMBAI: A day after he created a flutter among a few sections of Muslims with the suggestion that one big mosque in an area should use outer loudspeakers for ‘azaan’ if there are multiple mosques in that area, eminent Islamic scholar and leader of All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rahmani retracted his statement on Saturday. Acting general secretary and spokesperson of AIMPLB, Maulana Rahmani’s Urdu article and a series of tweets on Friday had suggested that Muslims must fight the communal forces but also ensure that they follow moderation while they perform religious duty. Adopting a moderate approach, he had suggested use of loudspeakers for Azan in moderation. “If a mohalla has many mosques, ‘azaan’ should be given on external mike at one big mosque and care should also be taken to ensure that the volume is not too high. It should be enough to reach the people in neighbourhood. In the remaining mosques, ‘azaan’ can be given on internal speakers or outside without speakers," wrote Hyderabad-based Maulana Rahmani. He added that care should also be taken in the positioning of loudspeakers so that they are not directed towards non-Muslim localities or hospitals. This would ensure they do not cause inconvenience to others. Criticism came fast through online comments from the orthodox section of the community. So, on Saturday, Maulana Rahmani issued a statement, retract his suggestions. “These were my personal views and had not the opinion of All India Muslim Personal Law Board. I retract them and regret,” it said. Though many in the community feel that ‘azaan’ on loudspeakers from multiple mosques in an area disturbs many residents, both Hindus and Muslims, the demand against use of loudspeakers is impractical.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-islamic-scholar-retracts-his-statement-on-azaan/articleshow/82009997.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

TOI did a reality check of the city on Saturday and found scores of local residents openly flouting the Covid-19 protocol and endangering their and other lives. For instance, at Chatori Gali on La Martiniere College bandha road scores of people were found engaged in eating snacks in groups with no social distancing. Similarly, a huge crowd was found in flea market of Aminabaad not realizing the danger which can put their lives in risk. The situation was no different in Lalbagh automobile market, or the mixed market of Alambagh, Telibagh, Sadar, Hussainganj---many were found without masks in public places. In Hazratganj’s Love Lane women were found buying clothes in groups with no social distancing. Talking to TOI, Akansha Singh (26), who came along with her friends in Hazratganj to shop, said, “What’s the use of Covid-19 protocol when people are getting infected even after corona vaccination. I’m maintaining hygiene and wearing a mask, but still I believe Covid second wave has been hyped.” There were also cases of people traveling in e-rickshaws and other public transport without wearing masks. TOI observed that markets with huge crowd movements had no Covid-19 protocol enforcement agency. There was no public addressal system to create awareness for corona in the entire city. “If the people don’t want to take precautions to save themselves from the virus, how much the police or administration can do about it,” said a cop posted at one populated roundabout. According to Lucknow development authority, 396 persons were challaned for not wearing masks in public places and Rs 39,600 was recovered from them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/city-revellers-turn-a-blind-eye-risk-lives-for-street-delicacies/articleshow/82010427.cms||---
---||Goa||Soon, 151 rural houses to be powered by the Sun||PANAJI: The state government has issued a work order to Convergence Energy Services Limited for commissioning of solar PV systems at 151 households in Sanguem, Quepem, Sattari and Canacona to provide electricity with comprehensive maintenance contract for five years under the Remote Village Electrification Programme (RVE). As per the cabinet decision, the work order is issued for the tender to design, manufacture, supply, install, test and commission a 500 Wp Solar condition system at 151 households, at the rate of Rs 43,000 each and six home lighting systems at the rate of Rs 20,000 each in Goa with comprehensive maintenance contract for five years under RVE. “The work should be completed within 120 days from the date of issue of this order. The warranty/guarantee for the systems shall be five years from the date of commissioning,” Sanjeev Joglekar, member secretary, Goa Energy Development Agency (GEDA) said. He said that the special purpose vehicle (SPV) module shall be guaranteed life of 25 years from the date of commissioning. A cabinet note said the programme aims to bring electricity, through renewable energy sources, to un-electrified remote villages, hamlets and wards where grid connectivity is either not feasible or not cost-effective. “Keeping in view the role of electricity in human and socio-economic development, this scheme is formulated to ensure last-mile connectivity and electricity connections to all remaining unelectrified households in the state. This scheme is therefore formulated in order to fulfill the government’s target of 100% electrification in the state,” the note further said. Under the scheme, 100% financial assistance will be provided to households, with an upper limit of Rs 90,000 per household, for a 500 Wp solar system. Each household will be charged monthly electricity charges, as determined by the government, depending on the number of units consumed. This amount will be used to create a village-wise or hamlet-wise corpus fund which will then be used to undertake maintenance of the systems after the expiry of the AMC period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/soon-151-rural-houses-to-be-powered-by-the-sun/articleshow/82010001.cms||---

The film theatre was made to pay Rs 10,000 fine and was warned for severe penalties if proper precautions were not taken. Wanaparthy zilla parishad chairman R Lok Nath Reddy had to cough up Rs 1,000 towards fine as the local municipal authorities noticed that he had not worn a mask during a function in which agriculture minister S Niranjan Reddy had participated. Interestingly, the fact that the ZP chairman was not wearing a mask was reportedly pointed out to them by Nagarkurnool MP Pothuganti Ramulu. On Saturday, Siddipet I Town police inspector Srinivas and the police team carried out a campaign asking people to wear masks. The police also distributed masks to beggars sitting outside a temple. Police warned people that action could be taken against him if they were not wearing masks. The campaign was conducted at bus stops, Rythu Bazar and several road junctions. Local authorities at Armoor in Nizamabad imposed a fine of Rs 1,000 on traders not wearing masks during an inspection they conducted. In Metpally of Jagtial district, the revenue officials who went around the town imposed a fine of Rs 1,000 on people not wearing a mask.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cops-crack-whip-on-people-sans-masks/articleshow/82010445.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

However, the recent surge in Covid-19 cases yet again forced the closure of schools till April 30. While the parents have welcomed the decision, the school managements say that the decision has disrupted the momentum of returning to normalcy. Meanwhile, Manmohan Jaiswal, secretary of the Uttarakhand Parents' Association, told TOI, “Many schools have taken the entire fees from the parents which was meant to be charged only if the offline classes were conducted. But now, with schools being closed for offline classes, there is a question mark on whether the schools will return some amount of the fees back to the parents.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/momentum-of-returning-to-normalcy-lost-say-schools-in-doon/articleshow/82009229.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Lucknow||Only 5 persons allowed at a time at religious places in Lucknow||LUCKNOW: With Lucknow reporting staggering 4,059 fresh Covid-19 cases on Saturday, taking its tally of active cases to 16,690, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath took a review meeting on Saturday evening and prohibited the entry of more than five persons at a time into any religious place. As the city faced a massive crunch of hospital beds on Friday and Saturday, the government has decided to convert three hospitals, Era Medical College, TS Mishra Medical College and Integral medical College, to dedicated Covid facilities. The CM has said that at least 2,000 ICU beds must be made available immediately while another 2,000 Covid beds must be readied within the next week. By Sunday morning, Balrampur Hospital will be starting a 300-bed Covid facility. The CM has allocated one hospital each to the medical education minister, principal secretary (medical education) and secretary (medical education) and the Balrampur Hospital to the health minister. They will survey the hospitals and start the process for converting them to dedicated Covid facilities immediately. They will also ensure that there is sufficient trained manpower available at all four hospitals, including ventilators and high flow nasal cannula (HFNC). The district magistrate has been directed to ensure that there is no shortage of oxygen in any Covid hospital in the district.The CM said that to control the spread of Covid-19 in Lucknow, which has seen daily cases rise from 935 on April 1 to 4,059 on April 10, comprehensive contact tracing was needed. “At least 30-35 people who could have come in contact with a positive person have to be identified and tested. Ambulances should be linked with the integrated command and control centre so that patients can get ambulance services on time. There should be a nigrani committee in every village and in every block of the urban local body,” the CM said. Containment zones will be monitored strictly and nobody will be allowed to enter or leave. He also focussed on the need for carrying out a cleanliness, sanitisation and fogging drive across the district. This, he said, should especially be done at bus stations, railway stations, airports, crossings and all crowded places. Police, fire services, housing development and development authority should assist in this exercise. The CM also directed the ice commissioner to initiate a dialogue with traders and shopkeepers so that social distancing can be maintained in markets. People should be encouraged to wear masks. The government has already imposed a night curfew in the Lucknow municipal area from 9 pm to 6 am. Directions have also been issued to limit the number of staff in government and private offices to 50% of the total capacity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/only-5-persons-allowed-at-a-time-at-religious-places-in-city/articleshow/82010449.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No HC relief for man for forcible end of pregnancy||MUMBAI: Declining relief to a man charged with forcing a woman to terminate her pregnancy twice against her wish, Bombay high court observed that an amicable settlement with her is no basis to quash the first information report. A bench of Justices S Shinde and Manish Pitale rejected his petition to quash to the FIR by Ambernath police station under IPC sections 376 (punishment for sexual assault) and 313 (causing miscarriage without woman’s consent). On March 31 the judges were told the parties have amicably settled the dispute and the woman also said she has voluntarily agreed to the settlement. However, the prosecutor opposed quashing of FIR, saying that the allegations against the man are serious as he has not only committed offence under section 376 but even section 313. Regarding the allegation under section 313, the judges in their April 5 order, noted that the victim alleged that upon disclosing to the accused that she is pregnant, he took her against her wish to a doctor who prescribed pills that terminated the pregnancy. A second time he took her to a hospital where the pregnancy was terminated against her will. He promised to marry her but decided to marry another woman. “It appears from the allegations in the FIR that since inception the petitioner gave false promise of marriage to the victim and had sexual intercourse and twice forcibly terminated the pregnancy,” the judges said, adding that there is an “irresistible prima facie conclusion” of his clear involvement in the alleged offences, While the man’s advocate relied on judgments on consensual sex, the judges said facts of those cases and this are distinguishable. They said they petitioner cheated the victim since inception by giving false promise of marriage and not fulfilling it. “...the FIR cannot be quashed on the basis of amicable settlement...” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-hc-relief-for-man-for-forcible-end-of-pregnancy/articleshow/82010010.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Nagpur||Wadi hospital did not have nod to treat Covid patients, probe begins||NAGPUR: Skeletons have started tumbling out of Well Treat Hospital’s closet after four patients under treatment at the intensive care unit of the hospital in Wadi died following a massive fire on late Friday evening. The hospital, which claims to be a multispeciality facility, has no firefighting compliance or occupancy certificate (OC). More importantly, the hospital had no permission to function as a Covid care facility and yet was illegally treating patients affected by the disease, as per the district health office. The Wadi police have identified the deceased as Shivshakti Sonbhasre (35, a resident of Gondegaon in Parseoni), Tulsiram Pardhi (47, a resident of Darshan Society, Gorewada), Prakash Bode (69, a resident of Manish Nagar) and Ranjana Kadu (44, a resident of Dhapewada). Assistant fire station supervisor, Wadi municipal council, Rohit Shelare told TOI that the hospital lacked adequate firefighting arrangements. “There is not even an emergency staircase at the hospital,” he said. Some of the hospital staffers, requesting anonymity, said that they were never given basic firefighting training. “Hence, they could not douse the flames with the fire extinguisher,” said fire department officials. Sources who did not wish to be named questioned how a hospital could start operations without the mandatory clearances. They said corrupt dealings cannot not be ruled out and hoped that the guilty are identified after investigation and punished. “When the incident occurred, the 40-bed hospital located on the second, third and fourth floor of a multi-storey building had 31 patients,” said the staffers. The fire damaged many beds with ventilators and other machineries, they said. The district officials shifted the patients to other government and private hospitals across Nagpur city and tehsil places. Later, the Wadi police sealed the hospital in the wee hours of Saturday. Wadi police started investigation on Saturday. Electrical engineers from MSEDCL carried out a spot panchnama at the hospital. “They will investigate the exact cause of fire,” deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Noorul Hasan told TOI. Currently, the Wadi police have registered four accidental deaths and case of accidental fire under relevant sections of law. Forensic team of Nagpur city police too carried out panchnama. Based on their reports, the Wadi police will file an FIR and investigations will proceed accordingly, said the DCP. Senior PI from Wadi police station PB Suryawanshi said that apart from Wadi police, a medical board headed by the district civil surgeon will also conduct a probe. “The board will consider all the observations of the police, forensics team and Wadi police investigation report,” he said. TOI tried to contact the hospital’s director Dr Rahul Thawre, but his cell phone was switched off. Local residents and the Bahujan Samaj Party staged a protest outside the hospital demanding action against the hospital’s director. Residents claimed that the hospital was constructed by submitting forged no-objection certificate from the Wadi municipal council. Despite this being brought to the notice of Wadi police, and civil surgeon Dr Devendra Paturkar’s office, no action was initiated against the hospital, they said. “Had timely action been taken, the tragedy could have been averted,” said Bhaurao Revatkar, a local resident. Dr Paturkar did not respond to TOI’s call and text message. Revatkar also demanded Rs25 lakh compensation to the kin of the deceased and Rs5 lakh to other patients admitted to the hospital at the time of the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/wadi-hospital-did-not-have-nod-to-treat-covid-patients-probe-begins/articleshow/82009233.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Nagpur||3 months on, no arrests in Bhandara hospital fire case||NAGPUR: Exactly three months have elapsed since 10 babies died in the blaze at the Bhandara district general hospital in the wee hours of January 9 but till date no arrests have been made in the case. Though some administrative actions like transfers, terminations and suspensions were taken, prolonged hearing of anticipatory bail pleas of two nurses have delayed any action in the case of criminal negligence. After more than half a dozen adjournments, the Bhandara sessions court has slated the next hearing in the anticipatory bail pleas on April 15. The case would be heard before the principal district and session judge. Offence was registered at Bhandara police station against the two nurses, Smita Ambilduke and Shubhangi Sathawane, for culpable homicide and not amounting to murder after a delay of around 40 days. Prior to this, three nurses had approached the sessions court for confirmation of their anticipatory bail pleas. Apart from Ambilduke and Sathawane, a senior nurse Jyoti Balsagre (Choudhury) too had filed an anticipatory bail plea though she was not made an accused in the FIR. According to sources, the court had granted bail. Police claimed that they were not given opportunity to challenge Balsagre’s plea. According to a senior police source, the court was submitted various reports, including that of the administrative committee that conducted investigation into the incident. The CCTV footage was also presented before the court in which Sathawane and Ambilduke were not found present at their respective place of duties. The cyber data was also presented before the court in which it was underlined that the two nurses were on social media when the fire was spreading in the neo-natal intensive care unit (NICU). The time lapse of around 20-21 minutes after the fire started and spread inside the NICU too was established before the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/3-months-on-no-arrests-in-bhandara-hospital-fire-case/articleshow/82009237.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||India||Now, Andhra Pradesh CM to be appraisal authority of IAS, IPS officers||VIJAYAWADA: In a move that would put the career prospects of IAS and IPS officers directly under the control of a politician, the AP government on Saturday issued orders changing the service rules of the All-India Service Officers. With this, the CM now has the authority to accept annual performance appraisal reports. So far, the chief secretary was the accepting authority for appraisal reports of IAS and IPS officers. This is perhaps the first time in the country that a state government has come out with orders granting the power of “accepting authority” to the chief minister. Under the new orders, the chief secretary is the “reviewing authority” of annual appraisal reports of All-India Service Officers, while the heads of departments are the “reporting authority”. The final decision whether or not to accept the appraisal reports rests with the CM. Sources, however, said the validity of these orders is doubtful and the Department of Personnel and Training in the central government, which controls All India Service officers, may not accept this if anyone challenges the orders. In the orders, the state government said that the changes have been made to “ensure uniformity and control of the executive over the administration for effective public service delivery.” Former bureaucrats, however, are divided over whether the GO would stand to legal scrutiny. Some fear that the administration will weaken from inside as IAS and IPS officials may not honour the hierarchy as their appraisal would be cleared by the chief minister himself. K Prabhakar Reddy, former IAS officer, who served in the CMO, told TOI that to his knowledge, no CM in India has made such provisions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/now-andhra-pradesh-cm-to-be-appraisal-authority-of-ias-ips-officers/articleshow/82011034.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Pay 200% more for 30-minute car parking at CCS airport||LUCKNOW: From next week, you will have to shell Rs 90 for parking your private car for 30 minutes at Chaudhary Charan Singh airport. This is a sharp jump of 200% from the existing Rs 30 charged for the same duration. Representatives of private concessionaire Adani Group, which is responsible for operating the airport, said that the parking had been outsourced to a third party. Its public relations officer, Abhishek Jaiswal, however, confirmed that the hiked fee would be implemented from April 15 onwards. As per the revised rates, which have been displayed on posters put up on the airport premises, Rs 90 charge for 30 minutes would go up to Rs 150 for two-hour parking. Beyond that, additional Rs 40 would be charged for every two hours. The charge of 24-hour parking is now Rs 590, up from Rs 255. “Twice a year, I go for vacations with my family and leave our car at airport parking as it was cheap and safe. Now, we will have to think twice and go for a taxi,” said Gargi Sinha. Similarly, for two-wheelers, Rs 30 will be charged against the current rate of Rs 10 for half an hour, and Rs 80 will be charged for up to two hours. In case of bus and minibus, tourists will have to pay Rs 500 and Rs 300 for up to half an hour against the current charge of Rs 40 and Rs 30. But for 24-hour parking, these passenger vehicles will have to pay Rs 3,000 and Rs 1,875, respectively, which is almost 900% against the current charge of Rs 300.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pay-200-more-for-30-min-car-parking-at-ccs-airport/articleshow/82010460.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||Nagpur||Central govt playing vaccine politics with non-BJP ruled states: Nana Patole||NAGPUR: Taking the ‘vaccine politics’ row a notch higher, state’s Congress president Nana Patole alleged that the Central government is discriminating against non-BJP ruled states. Patole, known for his no-holds-barred style of speaking, went on to add that the “biggest sin” of the Central government was the rationing of vaccines. Speaking to reporters at the Nagpur airport, Patole said, “Do they (Central government) feel that in Maharashtra only people belonging to Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena reside. They are playing (vaccine) politics with states which are ruled by non-BJP parties by giving less vaccines. And the impact of that is now visible in Maharashtra.” Patole called out the Centre for maligning Maharashtra over the ‘mismanagement of the vaccination program’. “They blamed us for not handling things properly and even provided details on the percentage of vaccine wastage. We all are now aware that UP has a wastage rate of around 9%, much higher than ours. Maharashtra has no intention of indulging in any political one upmanship, all we want is that our state must get the required stock of vaccines to meet our target of 6 lakh vaccinations per day.” said Patole. Regarding Saturday’s all-party meet on the lockdown, Patole said, “No final decision has been taken yet, but there is a need to break the chain of the virus infection. You all are aware of the rising number of positive patients and deaths. The rate of infection needs to be checked oe else the situation will become worse. At the same time we are looking at the economic concerns of people and the Congress party will be appealing to the state government to provide some kind of financial assistance.” On the issue of relief package too, Patole did not shy away from taking a swing at the Centre saying the state should not be too hopeful for financial assistance. “Last year Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a Rs 20 lakh crore financial package. We (Maharashtra) are yet to see even a single rupee. Many are still only counting zeroes from that financial package. So we (Congress) will suggest that the state should pitch in with some kind of relief,” said Patole.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/central-govt-playing-vaccine-politics-with-non-bjp-ruled-states-patole/articleshow/82010020.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

On Friday, a major fire broke out on a 25-acre farm in Kutri Nadanna village destroying standing crop worth several lakhs. It also gutted a five-acre land where harvested crop was heaped, apart from damaging a tractor. One of the affected farmers Narayan Singh said that a short circuit in the electric motor on the field likely caused the fire. On information, fire brigade rushed to the spot and doused the flames. Meanwhile on Saturday, a fire broke out at an agricultural land in Makrandpur village of Gadarpur town destroying standing wheat crop on 15 acres. Fire officer Chandra Prakash said that three fire tenders were pressed into service to douse the flames which caused losses to the tune of over Rs 6 lakh. The tehsil administration officials visited both the spots and took stock of the situation. However, the affected farmers said that officials should release the compensation immediately as the wheat procurement season is going on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/wheat-crop-on-45-acres-gutted-in-us-nagar/articleshow/82009255.cms||Aakash Ahuja

Raut stressed on better co-ordination between the district administration headed by collector Ravindra Thakare and the civic body under Radhakrishnan B. During the meeting, Raut also instructed the district administration to keep a close watch and gather data of positive persons and update it at the control room at the Taluka level. The guardian minister also urged the tehsildar and police to hold meetings with doctors in rural areas to get information regarding symptomatic patients. In a similar manner, Raut also asked the police and civic body to co-ordinate at the zone-level in the city for collecting information and data about probable patients with symptoms. Meanwhile, city police chief Amitesh Kumar said people on roads on the first day of the weekend restrictions on Saturday were nearly 75% less compared to the earlier times and vehicular movement too was less in the afternoon. “There were agitations at some places. Places like Law College Square and Variety Square were under stricter surveillance,” he said. City police had pulled up 131 vehicle owners for violations and another 46 persons for not using masks. People were checked stringently wherever unnecessary movement was noticed,” he added. Kumar said a fresh strategy would be implemented as the state government is expected to issue some more guidelines in the next couple of days. “We are leaving no scope for any kind of misadventure.

---||Ahmedabad||Vaid ordered to compensate NRI||Ahmedabad: A consumer court has ordered an ayurveda practitioner to refund the cost of medicines and pay compensation to an NRI, who complained of deterioration in her health due to steroids and toxic metals in the medicines. The case involved Neeti Bhatiya (44) from California, who had come to Anand to meet her parents in August 2017. She consulted Vaidraj Harinath Jha and Dr Dhanvantarikumar Jha at Ayurvedic Sankul in Anand for treatment of lipoma in her arm. She was told there is no allopathic treatment for the condition, and ayurvedic treatment would be costly and time-consuming but it would be effective. As Bhatiya had to return to the US, she got various medicines from the vaid for 15 months. She and her father, O P Khurana, who lives in Anand, insisted on receipts for payment made towards purchase of the medicines. The amount paid was Rs 2.33 lakh. After her return to the US, she fell ill; started having back pains and difficulty in walking properly. She informed the vaid twice but did not get any response. Bhatiya consulted doctors as her health deteriorated further. Doctors suspected toxic metals in her body and diagnosed her as having lead poisoning and mercury poisoning due to presence of heavy metals like lead and mercury in the medicines that she had been taking for past few months. The patient sent a legal notice to the vaid and then sued him at the Anand District Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, demanding Rs 13 lakh as compensation, claiming that she could not work for a few months due to the side-effects of the medicines. In response, the vaid claimed that he treats people free of cost. When Bhatiya returned to him after 10 days of initial treatment, she was happy and told him that the medicine was effective. She called him after returning to US, but he told her that further advice could be given only after she visited India and he could examine her. This might have irked her. After hearing both sides and perusing the receipts issued for payment towards the medicines, the consumer court concluded that it was a deficiency in service on the part of the vaid and ordered him to return Rs 2.33 lakh with 9% interest. He has also been ordered to pay Rs 15,000 to the NRI extra as compensation for mental harassment and legal expenditure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vaid-ordered-to-compensate-nri/articleshow/82009680.cms||---

Urging people to come forward and get them vaccinated against the pandemic virus, additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said: “We hope to hold 6,000 – 8,000 sessions across the state in the three-day utsav. The eligible persons must make the most of it,” he said. It may be noted that on an average, 5,000 sessions are held every day. An estimated 100 persons per session are to be vaccinated each day. This translates into a hefty target of vaccinating about six lakh persons per day. Later, chief secretary RK Tewari issued a detailed order to district magistrates on the Teeka Utsav and he also directed them to ensure that Covid-19 prevention protocol is followed on vaccination sites. He directed them to undertake awareness campaigns against irresponsible behaviour responsible for spread of the pandemic infection. Meanwhile, talking about the achievement made on the vaccination front, Prasad said, “So far 84,18,531 doses of Covid vaccine have been given in the state. Of these, 12,31,322 have taken both the doses of the vaccine, while 71,87,199 have taken the first dose.” Prasad also said that health staff were trained for the Tikka Utsav on Saturday as a result of which vaccination was organised only at medical colleges and district hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-receives-addl-stock-of-vaccines-for-teeka-utsav/articleshow/82010467.cms||---

While the state election commission (SEC) received a total of 532 nominations, after scrutiny, that number came down to 451, and after withdrawals, the number dropped further to 402. The elections will be held for the Mapusa, Margao, Mormugao, Sanguem and Quepem municipal councils. Of the 402 in the fray, Mormugao tops the list with 136 candidates, while Mapusa has 95, Margao 115, Quepem 62 and Sanguem 43. BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade had said on Thursday that the party is confident of securing all five municipalities. Reacting to the decision of opposition leader Digambar Kamat, Goa Forward Party president Vijai Sardesai and Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco forming an alliance for the upcoming Margao municipal council (MMC) polls, Tanavade had said it shows that BJP is winning in Margao. The counting of votes will be taken up on April 26. As per the Supreme Court order, the SEC has to complete the municipal poll process by April 30. It may be recalled that in February, the SEC had announced civic elections to 11 municipalities on March 20, however, the date was later changed to March 21 after the Supreme Court stayed the high court order cancelling elections to five municipalities over reservation of wards. Later, on March 30, the SEC announced April 23 as the polling date for the five municipalities. With these elections, most municipality elections will be complete, except for the Ponda and Sakhali councils.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/next-weeks-municipal-polls-to-see-402-candidates-in-fray/articleshow/82010070.cms||---

We have already increased the capacity of the six existing jumbo centres by adding regular and ICU beds,” said Sanjeev Jaiswal, BMC additional civic chief (city). Jaiswal further said the Kanjurmarg plot will have 2,000 beds and 200 ICU beds. “The BMC will be the coordinating agency. This will be to prepare for a third wave.” According to Jaiswal, the BMC has already added around 150 ICU beds at its Nesco jumbo centre in Goregaon. “We now have 200 ICU beds at Nesco, which is the biggest ICU facility (for Covid) in the country. At the six existing jumbo centres, we now have 8,000 regular beds and 500 ICU beds. Also, the BMC has started planning for expansion of the BKC jumbo centre. We have done a lot of capacity enhancement,” Jaiswal said. Less than three months after dismantling its unutilised jumbo facility at Mahalaxmi Race Course, the BMC wants to build it again and wants the Royal Western India Turf Club (RWITC) to fund it; this has left the cash-starved turf club worried. On Friday, the BMC staff began its preparations for erecting tents in the parking area of the Race Course and took control of the owners’ lounge, which is situated in the members’ enclosure. “The state government is immediately taking over our parking area for building tents as a temporary hospital. We have been pleading and working relentlessly to request them to put it up somewhere else as our business is getting completely ruined,” RWITC chairman Zavaray Poonawalla told TOI on Saturday. “The BMC wants us to spend on the construction, which is nearly impossible considering our current financial condition. For me, my committee and senior officials this is just too traumatic,” Poonawalla said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-4-new-jumbo-covid-centres-to-be-ready-by-mid-may-or-june/articleshow/82010496.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The police said that the youth had morphed the picture as he wanted that the girl should not have any other friends except him. The father of the victim lodged a complaint on Friday stating that some unidentified person had morphed the photographs of his daughter with other boys and had posted them on Facebook and Instragram accounts of the girl and used to call up the girl from different phones. The accused constantly followed the girl on social media and also kept sending threat messages to her. Cybercrime cops registered an FIR and police inspector S R Muchal was handed over the investigation. After technical analysis of the posts and messages on social media by the accused, and WhatsApp calls, the police traced the location of the device of the accused to Sundarnagar in Naranpura Crossroads area. On Saturday afternoon, the cops detained Doshi, and after interrogation he confessed that he studied in the same college as the girl and he had morphed and posted the photos of the girl to isolate her from other students, so that only he could keep a relation with her. The youth had also downloaded various apps to make virtual calls to the girl and send messages to her. Police found the apps on Doshi’s mobile.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ict-student-morphs-photos-of-girl-nabbed/articleshow/82009682.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||With rush for tests, time for results doubles in Telangana||HYDERABAD: The time taken for RT-PCR test results has gone up from 24 hours to 48 hours at most testing centres across the city, with more people queuing up for testing than the capacity of the labs. At a corporate hospitals, around 300 samples are being collected each day since the last one week.  “This is compared to less than 10 samples per day just a month back. Even though our staff is experienced in handling the load, we had to press in additional staff for testing itself. On certain days, we were getting just 5 tests but now it has jumped manifold,” said an official from the hospital. Meanwhile, RT-PCR testing method is considered a sure shot way of knowing whether a person has Covid-19 or not. Individual walk-ins as well as prescriptions for RT-PCR tests as a pre-requirement for other procedures has increased too. “I had to undergo a colonoscopy for which an RT-PCR test is mandatory according to the doctor. When I went to the hospital for the test, I was told there is a waitlist and it will take more than two days to get the report. Following this, I visited three other diagnostic centres, but none had an earlier slot. When I finally stood in the queue for testing, it kept getting delayed as emergency cases and surgical patients were taken up on priority,” Suresh Rao, a resident of Manikonda, said. Meanwhile, with many smaller diagnostic centres and hospitals acting as sample collection centres and sending them to ICMR-approved testing centres, the overall load at big centres has jumped manifold. The fact that a test costs around Rs 500-Rs 700 at most places, has also given testing a push during the second wave. “Since cases began increasing, we have seen a consistent rise in numbers and are now getting up to 1,200 samples per day, from individuals, collection centres and corporate hospitals. In fact, there are a lot of walk-ins now as compared to the first wave. Many want to cross-check a report or want to self assess and walk in for tests sometimes even without a prescription. We are now running overtime to complete tests, but still the reports cannot be churned out before 36-48 hours,” said a representative of an ICMR-approved laboratory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/with-rush-for-tests-time-for-results-doubles-in-t/articleshow/82010478.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Nagpur||Kin asked for photocopies at 2am for Remdesivir||Nagpur: The news about the much-sought after Remdesivir injection being made available at major medical stores in Gandhibagh, Dhantoli and Ramdaspeth led to chaos and great inconvenience to relatives of Covid patients on the intervening night of Friday and Saturday. Many couldn’t buy the life-saving drug even after waiting till dawn as stockists refused to accept digital proof of Covid positive certificate, Aadhaar card and doctor’s prescription. In the latest measures to check misuse and black marketing, the district authorities had made submission of three documents a must for patients. As relatives had already spent most part of the day tirelessly running from pillar to post in serach of the injection, the news made them rush to stores without hard copies of the documents. “People insisted that they would submit the papers later and for the moment requested stores to accept digital copies on WhatsApp. But they refused. At 2am, how can one get a print out or photocopy away from home,” said a management consultant who joined the queue at 9.30pm on Friday. The professional questioned the district collector’s directives. “What is the actual order nobody knows. Stockists are giving only one dose at a time while a Covid patient needs six doses. This means citizens will have to go through the same harassment for every dose every day or night,” he said. The news attracted people from the outskirits who too had turned up without print outs or photocopies. The Remdesvir stock was said to be over at authorized outlets and later black marketers were on a looting spree charging relatives anything between Rs8,000 to Rs25,000 per vial. On Saturday night, the situation turned more chaotic as more relatives queued up outside a popular stockist in Ramdaspeth. At several places, a token system was introduced yet the crowd swelled. The district administration also launched a portal showing enough availabity of Remdesivir in each of the over 100 Covid hospitals in the district. But, aggrieved relatives said the hospitals were asking them to get the injection. Also, the district authorities did not clarify about patients who are moderate. Chartered accountant Bhavesh Gehani said, “I was searching for the injection for four days. The hospital assured our patient will get Remdesivir. Now, they are asking us to arrange from outside. In-house pharmacies are giving other medicines but only Remdersiver is not provided. All types of excuses are being given. I paid Rs 8,000 for one dose and got it finally.” Gagandeep Singh Vij, an NGO volunteer, said hospitals too are not sure of the next dose. Explaining the situation, Vidarbha Hospitals’ Association convener Dr Anup Marar said there are 2,769 doses as per the official data but the admitted patients are double in number. “Leave aside those in home isolation, most hospitals have been allotted 50% of the applicable quota. Till 10pm on Saturday, our pharmacy representative was waiting for the allocated 50 doses for 81 Covid and 9 SARI ward patients. Whom are we supposed to select and give? We were assured today morning of complete doses of 81 patients by evening. Now we know at 10pm that only 50 patients are to be picked and chosen. Tragic,” he said He added that private hospitals have been directed not to issue prescriptions to admitted patients and authorities will ensure that all of them get their daily doses by evening. “Almost all indoor patients who could not arrange on their own are screaming and shouting at us. What are we supposed to do? Someone should do something,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/kin-asked-for-photocopies-at-2am-for-remdesivir/articleshow/82010036.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

They added that students are forced to clean the toilets themselves as the contract of the sanitation workers who were hired by the college expired on October 31, 2020, and since then, no worker has been recruited in the college. The directorate of medical education floats tenders and recruits faculty and supporting staff for all government nursing colleges in the state. When queried on the issues, Asha Gangola, principal in-charge of the Almora Nursing College, said, “We have sent a request to the directorate of medical education to make the recruitments at the earliest possible.” The college, which started in November 11, 2019, currently has a total strength of 87 students in its two running batches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/students-of-state-run-almora-nursing-college-forced-to-clean-toilets-in-absence-of-sanitation-staff/articleshow/82009275.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Business as usual for industries, but more time sought for testing||PUNE: Industries reported a largely incident-free movement of workers and staffers to and from their shifts in the first 24 hours of the weekend lockdown on Saturday, but they have sought more time for the testing regime to be enforced due to the sheer volume. Proprietors and industry groups have reported that although police did ask for identity cards to be shown for employees moving on their own vehicles or on company hired chartered vehicles, no one was detained. Besides, there were no reports of police enforcing the testing order, where employees heading to their exempted offices and production units need to be tested negative for Covid-19 before being let through. “I received one report of some employees being detained by police a couple of days back at night, near the Balgandharva intersection, and they were travelling in a bus. However, that matter was quickly resolved and they continued their journey,” said the promoter of a MSME unit in Chinchwad. However, industries, particularly micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), have asked for at least a week more before the testing regime was enforced. The demand comes due to the tardiness in the issuance of results for existing tests done, as well as the shortage of testing infrastructure, particularly in the industry-heavy northern and western extremities of the city, industry observers said. “I had a number of RT-PCR tests done for my employees, and the reports are pending for three days now. Even though the government has allowed rapid antigen tests now, that still means lakhs of workers have to be tested. Employees are having lots of difficulties, and are moving from one laboratory to another in the hope of getting a test done. We would hope that the government allows us at least 10 days before enforcing the order, so that the tests can be done,” said Sandip Belsare, president of the Pimpri Chinchwad Small Industries Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/business-as-usual-for-industries-but-more-time-sought-for-testing/articleshow/82010040.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||CA wins protection in trademark tussle||Ahmedabad: A city sessions court has extended legal protection to a chartered accountant, whose former business partner has approached the city crime branch after their dispute over trademark already reached the court. Additional sessions judge Vinod Pramar ordered “interim protection” to chartered accountant Sunil Maloo and asked the cops not to take any action against him for seven days, after issuing a notice to him upon registration of an FIR. This was in response to an anticipatory bail application that Maloo filed after he got a call from the city crime branch upon receiving a complaint from Maloo’s former partner Vidhan Surana. They used to run a CA firm named Surana Maloo & Co, from which Maloo separated. His advocate Vishal Dave submitted before the court that Maloo was apprehending his arrest following the complaint from his former partner, who has tried to give a criminal colour to a civil dispute. After Maloo separated from the firm and established his own company under the name of Sunil Maloo & Co. He applied for trademark registration for ‘SMC’, which the former partner objected to. The dispute over trademark between the two chartered accountants is pending in the court. In response to the anticipatory bail application, the state government told the court that the crime branch had not registered any FIR against Maloo and that the anticipatory bail was premature. After hearing the case, the court disposed the anticipatory bail plea as premature, but granted interim protection to Maloo for seven days since the filing of an FIR against him by Surana, if the cops register any FIR in future. The cops would be required to issue him a notice before affecting an arrest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ca-wins-protection-in-trademark-tussle/articleshow/82009686.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Horse admirers make a beeline at Mallinath fair||Jaisalmer: The famed Mallinath cattle fair which started two days ago in Balotara’s Tilwara is attracting thousands of horse-lovers. This year, trading of horses is in full swing, compensating for the lost sheen due to non-participation of thousands of cattle owners because of the pandemic. Over 1,600 horses from Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, and Punjab have been brought here. There are horses which are worth over lakhs. A horse at the fair was quoted Rs 50 lakh and can run at a speed of 40kmph. The quality and price of the horses is judged by a race that is usually held in the evenings during the fair, said a visitor. A horse trader Mohan Singh from Gujarat, who has been taking part in the fair for the last 15 years, said, “Every year I purchase horses from here. This fair is the pride of Rajasthan.” Similarly, Roop Singh Khara, who has two horses and both have won four races till now, said, “I am not ready to sell them though I have got an offer of Rs 51 lakh.” Tejmal Singh from Magra sold his horse for Rs 8.50 lakh and has come here to purchase another horse. He said that he will witness the race and choose a horse. Owners have come with various breeds of horses like Malani, Marwari, Sindhi, Kathiawadi and Nukar Punjabi. A horse owner Roop Singh said horses should be insured as they are worth lakhs. He urged the government to help the horse herders in developing the best breeds. The cattle fair, which is also known as Chaitri Mela, kicked off on Wednesday evening with the hoisting of flag at Tilwara in Balotara subdivision of Barmer district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/horse-admirers-make-a-beeline-at-mallinath-fair/articleshow/82010054.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Party sources said that the MLA tested positive for the contagion on March 19 and was initially admitted to a hospital in Nanded before being shifted to Mumbai on March 22 after his health worsened. Antapurkar, who tested negative for Covid-19 on March 28, suffered a multi-organ failure and was put on a ventilator since April 1 before he breathed his last on Friday night. Besides Congress leadership, party workers as well as commoners have expressed profound grief over the demise of 62-year-old leader who was serving his second-term as an MLA. Local Congress activist Pradeep Mule said that Antapurkar was a down-to-earth leader who remained easily accessible. “Unlike many public representatives, he kept a low-profile and was easily availanle for anyone personally or over phone,” Mule said.

Much before the state government imposing strict curfew on weekends, Aurangabad district has been observing restrictions on weekends, apart from daily night curfew for about a fortnight. Authorities said that stricter weekend restrictions — jointly imposed by the state and district administration — will remain in place till early hours of Monday. The leading market areas wore a deserted look on Saturday while less quite a few people were seen in some areas having grocery stores and vegetable stalls. Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan said, “As per the ‘break the chain’ initiative, during the daytime there will be restrictions on gathering of four or more people while during night hours, restrictions will remain on the movement of people, except for emergency services.” He reiterated that all the essential services, including grocery, vegetable, milk, pharmacy services will continue to cater to people on weekends.

The PDS department identified these families and issued notices to recover the money for getting benefit of BPL and APL with the rate of Rs 27 per kg of wheat. Of the 1,600 employees, around 1,000 have already deposited Rs 1.37 crore, while the PDS office remained open on Saturday to collect money from rest of the employees. As per the rules, the BPL families get one kilogram of wheat for Rs 1 from ration shops, while APL families get at Rs 2 per kilogram. During lockdown, these government employees did not shy away from receiving free ration meant for poor families, even though these people were getting salaries. As per the rule, employees of the government departments cannot get ration from government shops under any scheme. The PDS department initiated investigation when it found that more than average distribution of ration was made in the last one year. It was revealed that about 1,600 government employees took benefit of free distribution of grains in the last one year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/1600-govt-staff-took-free-ration-during-lockdown-in-ajmer/articleshow/82010066.cms||---
---||Pune||Traders’ body demands extension in filing GST returns, relief from average power bill charges||Pune: The Federation of Trade Associations of Pune has approached the Goods and Services Tax council seeking an extension in filing of returns as their shops have been closed because of the ongoing Covid-19 restrictions. The Federation of Trade Associations of Pune (FTAP) has also written to the state power minister, Nitin Raut, demanding a relief from the average reading charged as their shops have been shut. In a letter to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) council on Friday, the FTAP stated that majority of the members traded in non-essential goods and their shops and offices were shut because of the civic body and state government’s orders. Majority of the traders also didn’t have the lT-related infrastructure of cloud computing, from where they could access their company data and file the GST returns. The traders would usually send the required data to the their chartered accountants or GST consultants, who would then prepare and file the GST returns for them. So, the traders won’t be able to file their returns in time, which is why they requested for an extension of all GST returns, which were due to be filed this month. The FTAP, in a letter to Raut on Friday, requested that the shops and offices not be charged as per the average reading of power units as mostly everything was shut. They said it was logical that consumption of electricity was miniscule compared to the previous period. Even the government staff would not be able to reach the establishments to get the actual metre reading. The traders too couldn’t visit their establishments to click a photo of the metre and send it, the traders’ body stated. The FTAP has urged not to charge average readings until the restrictions are lifted and correct the metre reading as acquired. Mahendra Pitaliya, the secretary of FTAP, said, “We are expecting a positive response to our demands.” Meanwhile, the FTAP members said they were firm about opening shops on Monday and were expecting a positive response from the state government about their demand to allow functioning of non-essential shops. The government authorities were likely to hold a meeting with the traders on Sunday to discuss the issue of opening shops, in wake of the ongoing restrictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/traders-body-demands-extension-in-filing-gst-returns-relief-from-average-power-bill-charges/articleshow/82010067.cms||Sarang Dastane

The fuel pumps were shut from 6am to midnight on the same day. According to petrol pump owners, due to this strike, the government will lose Rs 34 crore revenue and Rs 150 crore turnover. The petrol pump association claimed that because of the high VAT, the sale of fuel in the state has reduced considerably as compared to the neighbouring states like Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and others. Sunit Bagai, president, Rajasthan Petroleum Dealers Association, said, “The fuel pumps have just become a source of tax collection and we are asking that the VAT should be reduced so it is at par with the other states. While on Saturday, it was a one-day strike, if the government does not take some constructive action then we will be forced to go on an indefinite strike from April 25 and in that we would try to mobilise the public as well. On Saturday, around 7,000 petrol pumps across Rajasthan were shut.” The petrol pump owners are asking for a standard fuel price across the country and claimed that at present due to the difference in the prices with other states, criminal elements are indulging in smuggling of fuel. They get fuel from neighbouring states and sell it in black market Rajasthan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/7k-fuel-pumps-remain-shut-over-high-vat-rate/articleshow/82010060.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Every year, on Akshay tritiya, which is considered to be an auspicious day, many child marriages take place in the state, especially in Barmer district, despite the authorities making all possible efforts to stop them. District magistrate Vishram Meena has directed all the SDMs to set up control rooms in their offices to prevent child marriages on April 29. Meena has directed all SDMs to collect information about child marriages from patwaris and gram sevaks and also instructed them to immediately take action on getting any complaints. The SDMs have been appointed as child marriage prohibition officers under the Prohibition of Child Marriages Act, 2006 and they can take action as per the provisions of the said Act in their areas.

---||Aurangabad||State to hold spl exam for 4 nurses: HC||Aurangabad: Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has issued directives to the state health department to conduct special written exams for four staff nurses, who missed the recruitment examinations due to a text message received from the department in November 2019 informing that they were not eligible for the exams. Division bench of the HC, while granting relief to the four nurses belonging to the Latur division of health department, ruled, ‘As the special written examination scheduled on September 22, 2019 is over, let a fresh special written examination be conducted by the respondents within a period of two months from the date of receipt of copy of this order.’ Representing the four staff nurses, lawyers S S Thombre and P N Kutti sought relief on the grounds of parity. As per the Maharashtra Nurses Services Group-C recruitment rules 2015, the nurses who were appointed on executing the bond till December 2011, their services were regularized by conducting one written examination. In accordance to the regulations dated April 15, 2015, special written examination was conducted on July 17, 2016. Out of the 1,766 nurses, 1,248 appeared for the examination and their services were regularized. On June 28, 2016, the government issued a directing that nurses who were appointed between December1, 2012 and April 15, 2015 and were working in the government services on executing the bond, be given an opportunity to appear for the special written examination. Accordingly, on June 28, 2019, nurses temporarily hired during the said period were issued hall tickets for the examination scheduled on September 22, 2019. However, on the evening of September 20, 2019, several candidates received a text message informing that they are not allowed to appear for the examination scheduled in couple of days. It created confusion among the candidates who had received hall tickets. Due to this, many of them missed the examination, while the others who reached the exam centres were not allowed to appear for the exams. Soon, the candidates moved the HC, which in October 2020 granted relief to them by asking the state health department to conduct special exams for them. Those who appeared for the exams, have already been recruited and their services have been regularized.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/state-to-hold-spl-exam-for-4-nurses-hc/articleshow/82008561.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Of the total 1.13 crore people above 45 years, authorities could complete administration of vaccine among 31.63 lakh people so far. The daily administration of vaccine in the state is just 2.1 lakh. Pathanamthitta and Kasaragod stand in the first two positions in the administration of the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine among those above 45 years with 36% and 34%, respectively. Meanwhile, Thiruvananthapuram and Ernakulam with 3,93,831 doses and 3,46,416 doses stand in the first two slots in terms of total number of shots administered so far. “Limited number of Covid vaccine centres is a major impediment in expediting administration of vaccine. We have less than 150 centres in each district,” said Kerala government medical officers’ association (KGMOA) secretary Dr Vijayakrishnan. “We will have to arrange camps for administering vaccine for more people. The service of more paramedical staff and local body authorities should be ensured for conducting such camps. Shortage of vaccines is a major problem,” Vijayakrishnan added. The administration of the second dose of vaccine has touched just 9% in the state. Idukki (18%) and Kozhikode (12%) are in the first two positions. While all the polling officials in the state were given the first dose of vaccine, the second dose were administered on just 9% so far. Meanwhile, the state has achieved the target in administering the first dose of vaccine among the healthcare workers (HCW). A total of 4,91,099 HCWs were administered with the first dose. In case of administration of second dose of vaccine among the HCWs, Wayanad tops with 86% and Ernakulam and Idukki stand in second position with 82%. Of the target of 1,04,064 second shots to be administered among the HCWs, the state achieved 75% with completing 78,520 doses by April 10. “The government has asked the district administrations to adopt measures to increase the vaccination drives. The district administrations should enhance the facilities for providing vaccines to more people in their areas,” said one of the officials associated with the vaccination. Of the total 1,445 vaccination centres across the state, 1,066 are in government hospitals. Identification of venues for conducting vaccinations drive and unavailability of HCWs are other major challenges for enhancing the administration of the jab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/low-stock-a-concern-as-only-28-above-45-yrs-vaccinated/articleshow/82009325.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Aurangabad||Travel agent killed youth for money, say police||Aurangabad: The travel agent who was detained soon after the body of a youth with one of his hands missing was found in a graveyard here on Friday morning has confessed to the murder, police said on Saturday. The victim, Vikas Chavan (23), a resident of Pathardi in Ahmednagar district, had arrived in Aurangabad on Thursday evening to appear for bank entrance test. “The suspect, Shahrukh Khan, has admitted under interrogation that he attacked Vikas with a sharp weapon after a futile robbery attempt at the Chittekhana graveyard,” inspector Sambhaji Pawar of the City Chowk police station told TOI. A local court remanded Khan in four days of police custody. The suspect said that Vikas lost his hand while trying to save himself from the attack, said the officer. Police said that initially they suspected the role of more than one person, but the probe revealed that the crime was allegedly committed single handedly by the accused. “Although the suspect does not have any criminal record, the possibility of his involvement in other robbery cases cannot be ruled out,” said Pawar. Police received information from the Nayee Basti locality that a cat was seen moving on the roof with a human hand in its mouth. Soon, a team rushed to the spot seized the hand and sent it to the Government Medical College and Hospital for examination. The probe has revealed that the arrested suspect thought that the victim was from a well-off family and decided to rob him. The youth, however, had only Rs 500, which he refused to part with despite being threatened by the suspect. That resulted into a scuffle, in which even the suspect got injured. The suspect attacked the youth with the weapon as he was overpowered by him, said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/travel-agent-killed-youth-for-money-say-police/articleshow/82008570.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: BJP turns priest issue into poll plank||JAIPUR: The sit-in by Rajya Sabha MP Kirori Lal Meena along with the body of priest at the Civil Lines Phatak entered third day on Saturday. It has given BJP the much-needed ammunition to take on the ruling government on the law and order issue. A battery of BJP leaders and MLAs has swamped the protest site converting the issue into a political one in the midst of the ongoing bypoll campaign at three assembly segments—Sahara, Sujangarh and Rajsamand. Priest Shambhu Sharma had died at SMS Hospital on March 2 allegedly due to shock after his temple land was encroached by a local family in Mahua, Dausa. Meena is protesting since April 3 with the body. He brought it to Jaipur on April 8 on the direction of BJP state president Satish Poonia, who is expected to join the protest on Sunday. Former CM Vasundhara Raje had already released a statement supporting the call given by Meena and the party. "The deteriorating law and order are a major poll issue of BJP in the bypoll assembly segments. Raking up the issue would help them in convincing the voters while keeping the example of the priest alive," said a source. Known for his own style of politics, Meena is living up to people’s expectations. Earlier in the day, inspired by philosopher Karl Marx, Meena marched at the protest site holding a lantern, searching for a noble person, CM Ashok Gehlot to address his plea. Meena, without disclosing the name, told the media, "The state has offered a solution but that was rejected since they didn’t agree to the main demand," said Meena. Meanwhile, BJP has directed its Jaipur district MLAs to attend the protest in shifts until the protest continues. Former BJP president Arun Chaturvedi, Jaipur MP Ramcharan Bohra, Sanganer MLA Ashok Lahoty and Jaipur Greater Mayor Somya Gujjar have been spending hours every day at the protest site. Religious leaders have also extended their support to the movement. The issue in the times of corona has become a challenge for the police. Around 300 policemen have been keeping a guard in shifts. The protest site has been divided into two parts—the protesters on the one side and the police on the other side. Looking to Meena's nature, police has deployed four additional DCPs and ACPs along with Rapid Action Force, Vajr Vehicles and reinforcement to ensure any untoward incident can be controlled. Reacting to the BJP’s episode, transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said that BJP is playing politics over the dead body. “Holding up a dead body for more than 12 hours is a sheer disrespect of Hindu customs and traditions. This is on contrary to what BJP has done by forcibly cremated the body of Anandpal Singh by holding his family and village hostage,” said the minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-turns-priest-issue-into-poll-plank/articleshow/82009697.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Apex court to hear sand mining case on April 15||JAIPUR: After a prolonged wait of nearly three-and-half-years, people, real estate industry and stakeholders are anxiously waiting for Supreme Court’s hearing on sand mining case on April 15. On November 16, 2017, Supreme Court restrained 82 large sand mine lease holders in the state from carrying out mining of sand and bajri in the state. Since then, many infrastructure projects and private housing projects and residents are purchasing sand illegally after paying exorbitant price. Now, after the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) recommended to issue environmental clearance (EC) to valid Letter of Intent (LOI) holders, this will be the first hearing in the apex court. A source said, “The CEC was appointed by the Supreme Court to look into the issue of illegal sand mining. After the physical inspection, it recommended the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF&CC) to issue environmental clearance to valid LOI holders within three months.” The committee report recommended that the MoEF&CC will issue EC in respect of all the valid LOI holders recommended by the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) in its meeting held during 2014-2016 without insisting on submission of scientific study report as a precondition for grant of EC within a period of three months. According to sources, out of 82 large leases, the (EAC) recommended 65. “The final nod will be given by the Supreme Court,” said a source. The Supreme Court had earlier restrained large sand mine lease holders without procuring environmental clearance (EC) from (MoEF&CC). To grant the EC, the ministry later laid the condition to carry out a scientific replenishment study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/apex-court-to-hear-sand-mining-case-on-april-15/articleshow/82009694.cms||---

On Friday, the civic administration, as a part of its ongoing mega-vaccination mission, had immunized 6,785 beneficiaries. Besides the record vaccination figures, the civic administration has also intensified its testing drive with as many as 6,156 tests getting done on Friday — which is an all-time single-day high in Aurangabad. Aparna Thete, the in-charge of the mega-vaccination drive of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), said the civic administration has adequate vaccine stock. “All the zones within the municipal limits have been getting good response to the campaign. We expect smooth execution of the mission with more vaccine stocks expected within a day or two,” she said. Meanwhile, the AMC has intensified necessary screening by tracing high-risk and low-risk contacts of positive patients, besides scaling up the testing at six entry points of Aurangabad and seven major government offices. The central team, which is on an official tour of Aurangabad, has suggested that the mobile application facilitated by the AMC for Covid-related help to citizens should also highlight treatment charges at private hospitals.

The positivity has dipped by almost 10% between April 4 and 10 in Mumbai. While the positivity rate was 30.3% on April 4, it was 19.1% on Saturday morning. Experts say that the Covid wave will first peak and stabilise for a while before a decline in cases sets in. In Maharashtra, where over half a lakh patients have been testing positive for the virus daily since April 5, the dip that has been witnessed is comparatively smaller. The positivity rate of the state which was nearly 30% last weekend, which has dropped to 24% on Friday. Maharashtra had conducted over 2.4 lakh on Friday of which 58,993 cases were detected. Senior officials said that the tests in the state have gone up and nearly 70% of the test conducted by the state is using the RT-PCR method. “The state has made it mandatory for all industries, delivery personnel and so the number of tests is expected to go up in the next few days as well. The idea is to test more people so that they can be isolated and treated early,” said an official. State public health minister Rajesh Tope said that the per-million testing of Maharashtra is nearly 190 which is higher than the 140 tests/per million mandated by World Health Organisation. “The per-million testing in cities in Mumbai and Pune is much higher. We plan to keep the pace for at least the next few weeks,” said Tope. However, officials said that the ramping up of testing, laboratoriess across the state have a backlog of two to three days in processing the reports.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-slight-reprieve-on-covid-front-positivity-rate-dips/articleshow/82010504.cms||Malathy Iyer

The Centre had promised the next consignment to the state on April 20. However, the state has asked to send the next consignment this week itself. As per the reliable reports from the health department, the state has so far received 49,27,140 vaccines from the Centre. As on Saturday, the state has used 47,59,883 vaccines. Currently, Kerala has vaccine stock to run only this week. Highly-placed sources said that only two regional vaccine stores have stocks. The Thiruvananthapuram regional vaccine store has already run out of vaccines and it has been reported to the higher authorities. “There are no vaccines to supply from the vaccine store. Once the vaccines at stock with hospitals are completed, then there will be shortage here,’’ said an official from the health department. The Centre had directed all the state governments to organize ‘Tika Utsav’ (vaccine festival) between April 11 and 14. However, the state would not be able to do this if there is no adequate supply from the Centre. Based on the Centre’s directive, the state government had decided to launch massive vaccination drive from Sunday. For this, it has been decided to organize mass vaccine camps in all districts. As there is vaccine shortage in Thiruvananthapuram region, it has been decided to limit the mass vaccination drive to vaccine centres. There will be no vaccination camps for the time being until the new stock arrives. In other districts, vaccination camps will be organized depending upon the availability of vaccines there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/state-demands-50l-vaccines-from-centre/articleshow/82009341.cms||---

---||Agra||UP: Harassed by power dept officials for Rs 25,000, 17-year-old girl ends life||AGRA: Unable to bear constant harassment by power department officials, a 17-year-old girl died allegedly by suicide in Etah. Her family alleged that power department officials were seeking Rs 25,000 to settle a "fake" case of power theft registered against them. In her suicide note, the girl claimed that the officials threatened to send her parents to jail if they did not pay up. Police have now registered a case against the officials concerned. A resident of Rewari locality under City Kotwali police station of Etah, the 17-year-old girl hanged herself to death in her house on Wednesday afternoon. Her parents and two siblings were not home when she took the extreme step. Police recovered a suicide note supposedly left by the girl. The note read, “Policemen and power department officials are responsible for my death. My parents did not commit any power theft. Power department officials filed a fake FIR against my father. We are very poor people. My father is in deep trouble.” The girl’s father, Chhotey Singh (48), who works as a labourer, said, “My daughter was not able to bear the harassment by the power department officials. She ended her life by hanging herself. A power department team had conducted a raid at my house on April 5. Later, they registered an FIR against me on fake charges of power theft. I had no pending dues and never indulged in any power theft. I had been pressured to pay a Rs 25,000 bribe to avoid an arrest.” “On April 7, a vigilance team of the power department along with a few men in police uniform arrived at my home. My daughter was alone at home. They threatened her that they would send me to jail if they do not get Rs 25,000 within 24 hours. Unable to bear the pressure, my daughter took the extreme step,” he said. Additional superintendent of police OP Singh said, “On the basis of a complaint received from the girl’s father, an FIR has been registered against the vigilance team of the power department for abetment to suicide. We are trying to identify all the people who went to the house of the deceased regarding the power theft case. The girl’s father has also provided two phone numbers of the power department officials. Their names will be included in the FIR. The entire matter is being investigated in detail.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/harassed-by-power-dept-officials-for-rs-25k-17-year-old-girl-ends-life/articleshow/82008598.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Women labourers cremated after cops’ assurance to kin||JAIPUR: Two women labourers, who were buried alive in a sand mine at Mundia Kala at Todaraisingh in Tonk after it collapsed on Friday, were cremated on Saturday. The family of the deceased had been demonstrating with the bodies at the block level office since Friday evening, demanding Rs10 lakh compensation and a government job for the children. They agreed to cremate the bodies later in the day. The deceased women — Badri Devi and Santra Devi — were trapped after a side portion of the rock collapsed while they were working together. They were rescued by other labourers present in the area and rushed to the hospital in Todaraisingh. Badri was declared brought dead, while Santra was rushed to Kekri hospital, where she died after some hours. The family of the two women alleged that the mining being done was illegal and the contractor never follows the safety precautions, which has led to the death of the two. The families, joined by the villagers, gathered at the block office, demanding police complaint against the contractor, Rs10 lakh compensation and a government job. The police assured them of taking their demands to the district administration and of prompt action against the contractor, which resolved the issue. “The families agreed for the postmortem and the cremation,” said the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/women-labourers-cremated-after-cops-assurance-to-kin/articleshow/82009711.cms||---
---||Pune||Residents stay indoors, streets wear deserted look||Pune: The city roads sported a deserted look on Saturday – the first day of the weekend lockdown – as most residents remained confined to home, responding to the district administration’s appeal. “Barring emergency vehicles, others remained off roads. We are thankful that most people joined hands to contain the spread of coronavirus by staying indoors,” said the additional commissioner of police (west region), Sanjay Shinde. Joint commissioner of Pune police Ravindra Shisve said, “Saturday’s response from the citizens was very positive. Almost all shops and business establishments remained close. Very few people ventured out on roads. Only a handful of people were found on roads without valid reasons. We have 96 check-points on the city roads and people listened to the police personnel. We hope that residents will follow the lockdown norms on Sunday also.” Massive police deployment was made in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad for strictly enforcing the weekend lockdown restrictions, which came into effect from 6pm on Friday. TOI found minimal movement of people in the district on Saturday. Only essential service providers like medical stores and dairies were open. The Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad police and municipal corporations stepped up patrolling from Saturday morning. Announcements were made on the public-address system, appealing to public to co-operate with the district administration to break the chain of the coronavirus. Additional CP Shinde told TOI, “We have ensured that people travelled in emergency situations like seeking treatment, taking vaccine shots or writing exams. We have tried our best to ensure that people do not throng on roads without essential purpose. We have started three nakabandi points each at 32 police stations under the Pune police to ensure that people do not venture out without logical reasons. We have issued instructions to take action against people caught for not wearing face masks and loitering on streets without valid reasons.” Deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Zone II, Sagar Patil said, “We have detained more than 15 vehicles for travelling without valid reasons. Our enforcement is strict, but we have ensured that essential services are not disrupted.” DCP (Zone IV) Pankaj Deshmukh said, “Violation of restriction norms was less as most people kept themselves confined to home.” In Pimpri Chinchwad, two/four-wheeler riders with emergency reasons were allowed to commute. Deputy commissioner of the Pimpri Chinchwad police Sudhir Hiremath said, “Barring few incidents in which people were found travelling on roads, no major law and order problem was reported. We have fined motorists travelling on roads without valid reasons.” The highways passing through Pimpri Chinchwad and other roads wore a deserted look on Saturday, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/residents-stay-indoors-streets-wear-deserted-look/articleshow/82010095.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Dehradun||Over 2300 hectares of forests gutted in Uttarakhand since Oct||DEHRADUN: At least 2300 hectares of forest land has been gutted in 1649 wildfires in the state in the last six months, according to data available with the forest department. Over 12640 trees were charred too in the incidents. The highest losses were reported from Garhwal region where over 1,390 hectares of forests were gutted, followed by over 841 hectares in Kumaon. While the Garhwal region lost 9540 trees, Kumaon lost 2600 followed by 500 in wildlife sanctuary areas. According to the data, the highest number of trees were affected in Alaknanda (6535), followed by Badrinath and Gopeshwar forest division (3000), Almora forest division (1600), Civil Soyam Almora (1000), Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (500) and Mussoorie (5). Senior forest officials said that the major causes behind such forest fires are rising temperatures and human interference. They also pointed at the accumulation of pine needles on the forest floor this year as they could not be lifted due to the Covid-induced lockdown and associated curbs. Head of forest force Rajiv Bhartari told TOI that swift action is being taken to minimize the damage due to wildfires. “We have formed a committee to review the state forest fire management plan and the implementation of the directions given by the National Green Tribunal in 2016. Also, all divisional forest officers have been asked to present active fire data on a daily basis along with action taken to prevent such incidents." The state has so far registered five criminal cases under the Indian Forest Act, 1927 for causing fires in forests. While three were registered in Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary, another one was reported from Nainital and Terai East. Four lives, too, were lost in these fires. The Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary division has even announced a reward of Rs 1,000 for those who trace the culprits behind forest fires. To bring the raging fires under control, NDRF has already deployed three mobile battalions at three locations. Chief conservator of forests (Garhwal) Sushant Patnaik said, “We have a 21-member team stationed at Pauri while the other two are deployed at Nainital and Champawat. They are all armed with state-of-the-art equipment and safety gear. While the fires have been controlled to an extent, the operation will continue in full swing as the temperatures are rising again." Noted environmentalist Ajay Rawat from Naintial said, “It won't be wrong to point fingers at forest officials too. At times, these fires are lit purposely by the forest officials to hide their shoddy plantation work. They then claim that the saplings were gutted in the fire. The whole thing needs proper investigation."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/over-2300-hectares-of-forests-gutted-in-ukhand-since-oct/articleshow/82009347.cms||Shivani Azad

The Somnath Temple trust announced on Saturday that the temple will remain shut for visitors from April 11 for an indefinite period. The temple authorities will announce re-opening of the temple at a later stage. Devotees can participate in ‘darshan’ using online platforms, including the official website of the temple trust. Apart from the main temple, other temples under the Somnath Trust will also remain closed till further notice. All temples of Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Sanstha (BAPS) will also remain closed in Ahmedabad, said sources in BAPS Swaminarayan. Earlier this week, the famous Swaminarayan Akshardham temple at Gandhinagar was shut down. “All these BAPS Swaminarayan temples will remain closed till April 30. A decision on when to re-open them will be taken only after April 30,” said sources in BAPS. The decision to reopen them will be taken in view of prevailing circumstances, available facilities, and arrangements at the temples, according to sources. The temple authorities at Ambaji and Bahucharaji temples are yet to arrive at a decision on whether to allow visitors or close down the premise temporarily. “We will soon announce a decision on this,” said officials at the two temple shrines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/somnath-darshan-goes-online/articleshow/82009719.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad: Stung by Covid crisis, guides look for escort||AURANGABAD: Subhash Jadhav is a certified regional-level guide (RLG) with a good command of the German language and money was never a problem until the coronavirus pandemic struck. He has been forced to take up a farm labourer’s job. Jadhav, a favourite among German tourists, says he was earning six-digit monthly income before the outbreak of the pandemic last year. “With no helping hand, we are finding it difficult to make ends meet. With the situation getting grimmer, the future seems bleak,” he says, adding that he has no money left in his bank account. Jadhav is not the only one in the grip of a financial crisis. There are 40 other RLGs like him in Aurangabad who have either picked up menial jobs or are unemployed. Ram Pitambare, who has a good command of the Japanese language, says he tried to associate himself with relatives’ shops for some income, but fresh closure of commercial establishments has left him in a helpless situation. “The government authorities often refer to us as ‘cultural ambassadors of the nation’ but they are ignoring us during the current crisis. Despite repeated pleas to the Centre and state government, we have not received any relief during the lockdown,” adds Pitambare. Heritage sites and monuments have remained closed during the current pandemic for more than a year, except for around three months till March 11 this year. As per the service rules of RLG, certified tourist guides are not allowed to engage in any formal employment elsewhere, adding to the woes of these key players from the tourism industry. Shaikh Ayyasuddin, another RLG from Aurangabad, says the large geographical area of Ajant and Ellora caves should be taken into account while allowing opening of the world heritage sites during the lockdown. “The tourism industry has already faced more restrictions as compared to other sectors. The famous monuments spread over large areas should be allowed to reopen by following Covid-appropriate behaviour,” he adds. Unemployed at the moment, Shaikh is optimistic that the central and state governments will come up with some solution to end their woes. When contacted, Archaeological Survey of India authorities refused to comment while maintaining that they only abide by the government policies. Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel said the plight of tourist guides was already raised before the Centre. “They are among the voiceless who have been badly affected due to the government’s policies related to the pandemic. These guides are assets of the tourism industry and need to be supported during the current crisis,” he said. Umesh Jadhav, president of Aurangabad Tourist Guides Welfare Association, said Maharashtra has around 175 RLGs, including over 40 in Aurangabad. “The ministry of tourism has distinct guidelines for granting licence to RLGs, who also include guides with fluency in identified foreign languages. The process of selection of RLG involves an entrance examination and field training,” he said. Jadhav said these guides have had spent their valuable years of life in the field of tourism, which is worst-affected due to the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/stung-by-covid-crisis-guides-look-for-escort/articleshow/82008599.cms||Prasad Joshi

Singh, however, nabbed the accused,” said Kumar, adding that they handed over the accused to police, while Singh was admitted to a private hospital. Atrauli circle officer Sudesh Gupta said the accused, who identified himself as Nexe (53), a resident of Singh's village, told police that he had a rivalry with Singh for the past 30 years after the latter set his small hut on fire over some dispute. “Today, I got an opportunity to shoot him. I also attacked him with tongs,” the accused told police.

Officials stated that the district has a positivity rate of 7% in the wake of the steady flow of fresh cases in recent weeks. As of Saturday, the district has 1,185 active cases.Meetings were held by collector S Divyadharshini with deputy director of health services (DDHS) Dr S Ramganeh, joint director of health services (JDHS) Dr S Lakshmi, dean of Mahatma Gandhi Memorial (MGM) government hospital Dr K Vanitha and representatives of private hospitals in Trichy at the collector office before Covid-19 monitoring officer Reeta Harish Thakkar joined them in the afternoon for reviewing the preparedness.Considering the virulence in the second wave, the officials decided not to encourage home quarantine for everyone. The treating doctors at the government and private hospitals should consult with the public health department officials before allowing patients home quarantine.Private hospitals cannot allow a Covid-19 patient to be in home quarantine, but can be decided only by the health department by visiting the residence of the patient.Besides MGM where the old trauma care ward has been converted into Covid-19 treatment ward, the district has 19 private hospitals recognised to treat the Covid-19 patients. Private hospitals have been asked to increase the number of beds to tackle the sudden rise in cases. The volume of the sample testing was also increased to 4,500 in the last few days. The samples were collected in hospitals during contact tracing and fever camps in the corporation areas.

---||Jaipur||Congress to shift more Assam alliance candidates to Jaipur||JAIPUR: Three more candidates of Congress-led ‘Mahajot’ in Assam reached Jaipur late on Friday night taking the total number of alliance candidates from NE being hosted in Rajasthan to 20. One among the three is a Congress candidate while the rest belong to the alliance parties, sources said on Saturday. Two alliance leaders, who were not candidates in the Assam assembly polls, accompanied the 20 candidates. Fearing poaching and horse-trading by BJP in case of a hung verdict in Assam, the candidates were moved to the Congress-ruled state a day earlier. AICC general secretary in-charge of Assam, Bhanwar Jitendra Singh hails from Rajasthan. Party sources said the strategy to shift the alliance candidates to the desert state was planned during chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s recent visit to Assam for election campaigning. Few more candidates, including those from Congress and the Bodoland People’s Front, were expected to reach Jaipur late Saturday night or on Sunday. The candidates from Assam are being hosted in the same hotel on the Jaipur-Delhi national highway where the Congress legislators loyal to Gehlot were kept during the rebellion by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot in July-August last year. Since the Gehlot-government came to power in December 2018, the state has hosted Congress and alliance legislators from Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh during political crises in these states over government formations. Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on Saturday took a swipe at chief minister Gehlot for shifting the Assam election candidates to Rajasthan. Shekhawat likened Gehlot to a jailor. “Ashok Gehlotji has become the ‘badabandi’ (fencing) expert chief minister of Congress. The results in Assam are not out yet but Congress is beginning to fear the ghost of defeat. The party has once again resorted to ‘badabandi’ by bringing allies and its candidates from Assam to Rajasthan,” the Union minister tweeted. “By the way, this is the main job of the chief minister—creating a fencing of five-star services and capturing own leaders. This time the leaders of other parties too have been taken captive. It would be right to call Gehlotji the jailor of Congress!” Shekhawat said in another tweet. Congress state president and school education minister Govind Singh Dotasra reacted to Shekhawat’s remarks and said, "No one is a jailor and no one is ‘chowkidar’. People sent a ‘chowkidar’ to protect the country but you must have seen that a foreign company has revealed how much money was given to Indian middlemen in the Rafale deal. The question mark points to the PM. The Union minister should respond to this first."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-to-shift-more-assam-alliance-candidates-to-city/articleshow/82009717.cms||---

She also demanded that actual numbers of infections and deaths be revealed. Sonia said “mass gatherings for elections and religious events” had worsened the spread of Covid. Chairing a meeting of Congress CMs and ministers from alliance-ruled states, Sonia said, “We must focus on India’s vaccination drive first and foremost, then only export vaccines and gift them... The Modi government has mismanaged the situation.” At the meeting, the Congress chief ministers raised an alarm over the shortage of vaccines, with Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel and Punjab CM Amarinder Singh flagging that their stocks would last only three days. While Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot said shortage was a reality and urged the Centre to treat states as partners. The meet was also attended by Maharashtra minister Balasaheb Thorat and Jharkhand minister Rameshwar Oraon. Taking a dig at the Centre, Rahul Gandhi tweeted on Saturday, “What India needs? Jobs and Jabs; What BJP government gives? Jumlas and Jibes.” Crucially, Sonia also asked the party leaders to deliberate if public gatherings including election rallies should be prohibited. She urged party-ruled states to take strict measures to contain the pandemic.Touching upon the farmers’s protest, the Congress chief also noted that the party-ruled states had passed the new farm laws to undo the central Acts but had not received the Presidential assent yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sonia-modi-govt-compromising-covid-fight-for-pr/articleshow/82011087.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Frantic bid by kin of Well Treat patients to get bed in other hosp||Nagpur: Distressed relatives of the patients admitted at the Well Treat Hospital had more agony in store after Friday’s fire mishap — of shifting the patients to other hospitals. “We spent the entire night running pillar to post to find beds for Covid-19 positive patients,” was the reaction of the relatives of the patients who had a miraculous escape in the incident. The relatives of patients claimed that the administration provided no help. “They just asked us to take patients to particular hospitals without being aware of the status or the availability of beds there,” some relatives told TOI. Most spent almost the entire Friday-Saturday intervening night searching for beds for the patients and made their own transport arrangements without any help from the administration. “No ambulance facility was arranged for my uncle,” said Kunal Pathak, who rode with his Covid-19 positive uncle Hemraj Pathak (a resident of Ramtek) from Wadi to Datta Meghe Hospital in Hingna, on a motorcycle. “After failing to find a bed there, I went to Mayo hospital on Central Avenue. There too, my uncle was denied admission citing non-availability of beds,” he said. “We even met district guardian minister Nitin Raut at Mayo hospital and urged him to arrange a bed. But in vain,” Pathak added. “We made a last-ditch attempt at Hope Hospital near Automotive Square and as luck would have it, one bed with oxygen was arranged for him there,” said Pathak. Hemraj Pathak had tested positive for coronavirus almost a week ago. Due to non-availability of beds in Ramtek, he had a hard time searching for a hospital for himself. On April 7, he somehow got admitted to Well Treat Hospital. The plight is similar for almost all the patients. Relatives of Dulichand Patre, a resident of Mouda, after failing to find any vacant beds in city hospitals, shifted him to Amravati. Relatives of at least 8 Covid patients failed to find beds in hospitals and took them home. On Saturday, relatives of many patients also turned up at the Wadi hospital for refund of the money they deposited at the time of hospitalisation. “For every patient the hospital charged about Rs80,000 for the first four days of admission and care,” the relatives claimed. TOI spotted at least 6 people enquiring with Wadi police about the refund of their deposit. The police, however, expressed helplessness and advised them to contact the doctors. TOI also learnt that all the patients admitted in the hospital were Covid-19 positive and most of them hailed from rural areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/frantic-bid-by-kin-of-well-treat-patients-to-get-bed-in-other-hosp/articleshow/82010102.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The facilities are expected to be commissioned for public use after the election model code of conduct is lifted. At a cost of Rs 15 crore, the Trichy corporation, in February 2019 took up the civil work by demolishing an existing commercial complex and converting the same into a three-tier commercial complex. Situated in the 7th cross of Thillai Nagar, the demolished complex was constructed in 1972. With 8 shops and an office space rented to police and postal departments, the complex helped the civic body earn just about Rs 25,000 as rent each month. To generate more revenue in the commercial hub, the civic body included the proposal under the smart cities mission. As of April 2021, official sources said the 51,000 square feet three-tier commercial complex has only electrification and flooring work pending. The officials added that the entire complex will be handed over to a Trichy based private hospital on a rental basis. “Handing over to a single tenant makes the maintenance process easy and revenue generation is ensured without any delay. The hospital will use the facility for three years,” an official source said. The complex has a car parking space in the basement. Meanwhile, the corporation officials said the river-front development project on Uyyakondan canal banks in Puthur is also nearing its completion. A new road is now being developed for accessing the facility. The Rs 17.56 crore project commenced on March 2019 and has seen the installation of three public parks and a retaining wall on the southern portion of Uyyakondan bank along with the PWD’s aqueduct road, behind the Bharathi Nagar locality. “Civil work is nearing completion in both the riverfront development and Chathiram bus stand redevelopment projects. We can commission the infrastructure in a couple of months,” a senior official with Trichy corporation added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/three-smart-city-mission-projects-in-trichy-city-nearing-completion/articleshow/82010108.cms||Deepak Karthik

Food parcel orders increased by 40%-100% for several eateries in the city on the first day of the weekend lockdown on Saturday. Food delivery platforms Swiggy and Zomato continued to deliver after 6 pm on Saturday. A food delivery platform said that from 6pm-8pm on Saturday, food orders were up by 50% almost everywhere in Maharashtra. While Zomato was operational for the entire day for Pune, till late night in Pune, Swiggy was operational from 7am till 11pm, as per information displayed on the company’s app. Dunzo executed home deliveries of grocery, essentials and vegetable throughout Saturday. Home deliveries were also on for hypermarkets like Big Bazaar in Pune, said sources. Grocery shops and vegetable vends meanwhile were closed in Pune as part of the weekend lockdown, though citizens demanded that these shops be opened as they were functional in parts of Mumbai. Vice president of Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association (PRAHA) Vikram Shetty told TOI that food deliveries picked up for restaurants that had a tie-up with food ordering apps. “Many restaurants that do not have such a tie-up did not undertake any parcel services on Saturday as the PMC order had come late on Friday,” he said. Swanand Bhave, founder of Wadeshwar, said, “Orders through food delivery apps witnessed a 100% increase on Saturday at our outlets. People depended heavily on ordering food online as they were staying indoors. The average number of orders crossed 150 at all our branches till 12 noon on Saturday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/weekend-restrictions-drive-online-food-orders-at-many-restaurants/articleshow/82010117.cms||Neha Madaan

In an official statement, the zoo officials said the cub was injured after coming under its mother’s feet on April 6. “Tigress Bhakti had not been feeding the cubs since their birth. We had been offering the cubs goat milk. The injured cub had reduced its milk consumption and there was a decline in its health. The cub was being treated by a veterinary doctor, but died around 8 am on Saturday,” the statement reads. Sanjeev Sonar, the public relations officer of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), said the post mortem has revealed that the cub suffered internal bleeding. “The final rites were performed in the presence of the zoo and forest department officials,” he said. Sonar said the second cub was also separated from Bhakti after the first cub got injured. Both the white tiger cubs are the offspring of yellow tigress Bhakti and white tiger Veer. Honorary wildlife warden of Aurangabad Kishor Pathak said a probe is needed into the death of the newborn white tiger cub. “On the first day, the zoo authorities had said that Bhakti was not looking after her cubs and a caretaker was appointed to take care of the cubs. They claim that CCTVs are in place and the footage can be viewed to check the chain of events since the birth of cubs,” he said. In March 2016, two leopard cubs, barely a day old, had died at city zoo sparking outrage. The zoo, which has been operating in a cramped condition, had faced a closure in the past from the central authorities for glaring non-compliances including small enclosures for wild animals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/white-tiger-cub-dies-in-aurangabad-zoo/articleshow/82008607.cms||---

Nainital chief medical officer Dr Bhagirathi Joshi, said that the group, mostly on cycle, reached Bhimtal on Thursday. As a few of them complained of fever and cough, they were asked to go to BD Pandey district hospital and made to take a Covid-19 test. “While the students are under institutional quarantine, their instructor was shifted to Sushila Tiwari Medical College as he has breathing issues,” added the CMO. Meanwhile, at least six medical personnel tested positive for the virus in the state in the last week. This includes five nuns from a missionary hospital in US Nagar who were fully vaccinated.  Two more tested positive for the virus at IIT Roorkee on Saturday, taking the total number of infected at the institute’s campus to 92. Also, 11 people — including four students — tested positive for Covid-19 at the Welham Girls' School in Dehradun.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/20-students-on-pan-india-tour-test-covid-ve/articleshow/82009368.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Trichy||Trichy police launch probe into fake court warrant case||Trichy: Trichy city police have launched an investigation into the incident in which a man received a fake warrant resembling an official court order. This follows a complaint received by sessions court police from the chief clerk of judicial magistrate court VI of the district court, Venkatachalapathy. According to him, unknown people cheated a man by creating fake warrant documents using bogus seals of JM IV court. Cantonment police inspector Rajendran who investigated the case said the man, Farooq, of Trichy city received a courier on March 26 containing a letter mentioning a warrant to him in a case. This came as a shock to the man as he was not involved in any such case. Panic-stricken, Farooq took it up with his advocate who went to Venkatachalapathy. However, the employee dismissed the warrant as fake and confirmed that it was not sent by the court. Since the letter had the bogus seal of the JM IV court, the court deemed it fit to take it up with the police for investigation. Inspector Rajendran said the courier and the letter had no mention of the sender. He also confirmed that Farooq was not involved in any case, and that a case was registered against unknown people. It may be recalled that Trichy court had witnessed one such incident of fake documents being issued by a gang for sureties to bail out accused in several cases a few years ago. The police had arrested the gang already.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-police-launch-probe-into-fake-court-warrant-case/articleshow/82010104.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Dip in Covid positive cases on day one of weekend lockdown||MUMBAI: On the first day of the weekend lockdown on Saturday, the state not only registered a slight dip in positive Covid-19 detections but got an assurance from the Centre about additional ventilators and funds to hire additional healthcare workers to combat the second wave of the pandemic. Maharashtra registered 55,441 cases a 7% drop as compared to the previous day and 309 deaths. In only 11 days of this month, the state has added over 5.3 lakh fresh Covid-19 cases. Nearly the same was added in the entire month of September 2020, considered to be the peak of the first wave. Mumbai seemed grimmer in comparison as daily cases and deaths rose even as only 30 out of the 1,273 ventilators were vacant. While the state Covid update said 9,330 fresh cases and 28 deaths were registered in Mumbai on Saturday, BMC;s Covid update showed 50 deaths (the discrepancy could be due to delay in updating the ICMR website, said a senior BMC official). A senior doctor from a BMC hospital said that deaths could rise in the coming week because of the high number of hospitalizations over the last 10-15 days. “Usually, the number of Covid deaths go up a fortnight after a rise in cases,’’ said the doctor. Meanwhile, Union minister Prakash Javadekar, who was in Pune on Saturday, said the Centre would help Maharashtra procure 1,121 ventilators to meet the shortage across the state. “I have spoken with the central ministers and officers concerned about the acute ventilator shortage in Maharashtra. Within three to four days, 700 ventilators from Gujarat and 421 ventilators from Andhra Pradesh will arrive in the state,” he said. He added that the Centre would also help Maharashtra increase oxygen supply for Covid care. “Testing, tracking, tracing and treatment are the thrust areas of containing the Covid epidemic and the Centre has assured Maharashtra it will provide funds under the National Health Mission to hire additional manpower required for scaling up the operation,'' said Javadekar. He further said that 30 central teams are already in districts of Maharashtra, guiding and assisting the state health machinery in controlling the pandemic. Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who was with Javdekar, said the next 15 days were crucial for Pune as well as the state. Public health minister Rajesh Tope urged BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis to seek more vaccines for the state from the Centre. Tope said that while the Opposition has made many important suggestions and all of those will be considered seriously, they should also help the state by procuring the required amount of vaccines. He said that the irrational use of the anti-viral Remdesivir injection should be stopped in the state and a district-wise control room to monitor the availability of the injection will be created. In the meantime, the twin Kalyan-Dombivli city on Saturday recorded 1,996 fresh cases and three deaths, taking the tally to 93,773 and toll to 1,295 deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/dip-in-covid-positive-cases-on-day-one-of-weekend-lockdown-in-mumbai/articleshow/82010507.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Delhi||Delhi: Infections in educational institutes cause concern||NEW DELHI: In a worrying sign, universities and colleges are fast becoming the new Covid-19 hotspots. After a couple of positive cases, Netaji Subhas University of Technology (NSUT) has now set up a testing camp. Meanwhile, more students at Delhi University’s St Stephen’s College are learnt to have tested positive. A circular issued by NSUT stated: “(A) few cases of Covid have been detected on campus. To curb the possibility of further spread, it is imperative that Covid test be conducted for university employees and students residing on the campus. For this purpose, a camp is being organised at NSUT on Saturday. All employees, including outsourced workers and students staying on campus, are directed to undergo the test (sic).” It’s only recently that universities and colleges in the city were opened for conducting practicals. At NSUT, the BTech and bachelor of engineering exams have been deferred. The university also said that if students wished, they could vacate the hostels. “Students who stay on in the hostels are strictly prohibited from leaving the campus,” added the circular. According to an official, family members of two staffers have tested positive so far, prompting the direction by the university. At St Stephen’s college, more students have tested positive after a camp was set up. “These students had been on contact with a large number of people. So, other students are understandably worried. The college has not issued any order so far,” said a student. Over 200 students reside in the college hostels. A member of the governing body has again written to the principal, John Varghese, raising concerns over the Covid spread. Earlier, 13 students and staff members of the college had tested positive after they returned from a chapel trip to Dalhousie. “In continuation of my letters dated April 2 and 6 asking for certain information, I have the following queries. In the results of the test organised by SDM on April 7, have a number of students and employees tested positive? If so, how many? Since the second test had been made optional, should not mandatory Covid retesting of all students in the college hostel and of college employees (whether teaching or non-teaching) who have come in contact with students since March 31, be done, supervised by doctors from a government hospital or by a government facility to restore confidence in the test results?” the email stated. The principal did not respond to the query from the paper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/infections-in-educational-institutes-cause-concern/articleshow/82010120.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Goa||Former BJP corporator Menino da Cruz joins Cong||PANAJI: Congress received a boost in the state capital with three-time corporator and disgruntled BJP karyakarta Menino da Cruz joining the party on Saturday. In the coming days, Congress expects several other former corporators and prominent residents of Panaji to join its ranks. Party president Girish Chodankar said Congress plans to focus its organisational efforts on Panaji to try and rebuild the block. “I joined Congress because BJP is not the same BJP I joined in 2006,” said Cruz, a former Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) corporator. “People like us helped build the party, but now it looks like the party does not need us any more and I don’t want to demean myself by remaining in BJP.” Cruz, who is known to be close to several BJP functionaries, said many of the traditional BJP karyakartas are upset with the way the party has changed. He said he would work with Congress, particularly with Panaji block president Joel Andrade, to ensure that Congress wins the Panaji constituency in the upcoming assembly elections. Having been associated with BJP for close to 15 years, Cruz resigned after the party dropped his name from the list of candidates for the CCP elections. He was dropped at the behest of Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate, following which he openly campaigned against BJP and even supported Congress-backed candidates wherever possible. “We are focusing on Panaji as it is the state capital. Having an MLA here is a major focus for us,” said Chodankar. Monserrate was elected on a Congress ticket as the Panaji MLA, but he soon switched over to BJP and with him, a significant part of the Congress block followed suit. Monserrate’s entry and the ease with which he is calling the shots within BJP has also rankled the party’s karyakartas. “Many of my former colleagues are not happy. There is no satisfaction within BJP. For the last year or so, the party never called us or spoke to us,” said Cruz.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/former-bjp-corporator-menino-da-cruz-joins-cong/articleshow/82010113.cms||---

However, residents have opposed the move stating that they will be put to hardship as they have to travel a distance. “Instead of doing business from 6am, we have planned to start the sales as early as 3am. Since the weather is too hot, we will wind up by around 11am. Although the ground is difficult to do sales, we have no other go,” K Jaishankar, a representative said. The wholesale traders have agreed to do business in bulk while retail vendors will be given the opportunity to sell vegetables to grocery shops so that the footfall in the Gandhi market will come down. The permission to sell bulk vegetables by retail traders to grocery shops is seen as a move to appease them.As around 800 vendors are expected to establish stalls in the G Corner ground on the Trichy-Chennai national highway, the Trichy Corporation on Saturday marked the boundaries for each shop. Water tanks and mobile toilets were also placed on the ground. Officials sources clarified that other locations were not viable for accommodating the hundreds of vendors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/retail-veggie-traders-agree-to-shift-to-g-corner-ground/articleshow/82010110.cms||---
---||Trichy||Century-old Union Club to be demolished||Trichy: The district administration has planned to demolish the century-old Union Club situated near Bharathidasan road in Cantonment over the non-payment of dues to the district administration. On Saturday, the revenue department evicted the furniture and other belongings of the club to facilitate the demolition. Constructed in 1907, the club was allegedly defaulting the payment of rent to the district administration since 1971. The outstanding amount supposed to be paid to the district administration was estimated at over Rs 9 crores. Additionally, as the building is also ageing, the district administration has sealed the complex. The club sprawling for around an acre in the prime locality dotting government offices has been brought under the control of the revenue department. The physical belongings found inside the club were vacated to facilitate the demolition. The space after being completely retrieved will be put to use for other purposes by the district administration, the officials said. The union club is the second club in the city to face demolition in recent years. In 2019, Trichy Corporation had demolished the city club on West Boulevard road to facilitate the multilevel car parking facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/century-old-union-club-to-be-demolished/articleshow/82010121.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Now, IIM-Ahmedabad wants to scan Unesco-hailed restoration||AHMEDABAD: It seems IIM-A is back to square one as far as the restoration of the buildings of the main campus is concerned. More than three years after the restoration work on dormitory-15 and Vikram Sarabhai Library was completed, the institute has now come up with a tender document to ensure ‘structural safety’ of these two buildings. In 2019, the library was lauded by Unesco as a model restoration project. A recent tender notice issued by the institute proposes the selection of a structural design firm for the audit of the two restored buildings. A copy of the tender document dated March 31 has been reviewed by TOI. “The conditions for eligibility are very stringent. What is glaring is that only profit-making firms can make the cut,” said a renowned city-based architect who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “This would leave all IITs and many other government institutions out of the race,” the architect said. The tender document comes at a time when as many as 100 students are reportedly infected with Covid-19 on IIM-A campus. The last date for the submission of tender documents is April 21. “The trouble is that such a small window in such a terrible time will effectively limit the applicants to only those who are familiar with the two structures and those who are based in Ahmedabad,” said an IIM-A alumnus. He too wanted to remain anonymous. Maintenance manual The institute is renowned across the world for the architectural beauty of its heritage campus created by the legendary architect Louis Kahn, according to the tender document. Explaining the rationale for inviting structural design firms to inspect the two buildings, the document states that the ‘maintenance manual’ for restored buildings mentions it. “To ensure structural safety of the buildings, IIM-A needs to conduct inspection, non-destructive tests, and scientific analysis by an experienced structural consultancy agency,” it says. IIM-A had in December 2020 announced its plans to demolish 14 of the 18 student dormitories citing safety concerns. The board of governors (BoG) of IIM-A put the plans on hold following a massive global outcry over the decision. The board said it will re-evaluate the decision. “We engaged one of the best teams of conservation architects — SNK (Somaya & Kalappa Consultants) —and restored Dorm 15 and the library,” the BoG said in a communication to all stakeholders on January 1. The conservation architects had hired a team from IIT-Madras for seismic surveys. The view of a third-party structural engineer, whose identity remains unknown so far, is presented as the reason for the decision to demolish the dormitories. In February, the BoG said in a statement that the institute will hold further consultations with international experts regarding the feasibility, safety, and sustainability of restoration of the structures. Mahendra Raj, India’s famed structural engineer who was the advisor to the structural team involved in the creation of the IIM-A campus, has brushed aside IIM-A’s contentions about the poor quality of bricks. He has told TOI that ‘first-class bricks’ were used for IIM-A.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/now-iim-a-wants-to-scan-unesco-hailed-restoration/articleshow/82009730.cms||Maulik Pathak
---||Nashik||Weekend lockdown empties roads||Nashik: The weekend lockdown evoked a good response across the city, the district and even the neighbouring districts on Saturday, with heads of police units across north Maharashtra expressing satisfaction. The city streets were mostly empty throughout the day. The only people out on the roads were those working in the industrial units or those who had relatives admitted to medical facilities. No buses were operated as there were no passengers. There were, however, a few autorickshaws at the Nashik Road railway station. DCP (crime) Sanjay Barkund said the response was good. Even owners of grocery stores decided to keep their shutters down. While police personnel were deployed across the city and every police station had at least three checkpoints, the police did not have to struggle to appeal to people to keep their establishments closed. Nashik rural SP Sachin Patil said that the weekend lockdown was observed across the rural areas of the district. Though police had to take action at some places, the overall scenario was satisfactory. Jalgaon SP Pravin Munde too expressed satisfaction over the response to the weekend lockdown. “The police were out in full force to implement the weekend lockdown, but the overall response has been good. This would definitely break the chain of Covid transmission.” Ahmednagar SP Manoj Patil had a similar reaction. He said the cops did not have to take action against anyone. Additional SP of Dhule Prashant Bacchav said the citizens of Dhule adhered to the lockdown rules and barring medical stores, all commercial establishments were closed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/weekend-lockdown-empties-roads/articleshow/82008613.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Singh is facing multiple charges, including a “fake encounter” and arrest of 10 people following a dispute over payment at a dhaba on March 4. While framing 10 innocent people, local police had alleged that they were part of a gang and had been hatching a robbery conspiracy. Police had also claimed to have arrested the accused after an encounter and seized six illegal weapons, 80 litres of illicit liquor and 2kg contraband from their possession. Following the dhaba owner’s complaint and TOI’s report, senior police officers in the Agra zone had intervened and an FIR against three policemen was registered on March 23 based on the findings of the preliminary probe. The case was subsequently transferred to neighbouring Aligarh district. One of the accused constables Shailendra Kumar and local liquor mafia Bantu Yadav were arrested on March 26, while inspector Singh and another constable Santosh Kumar kept dodging police. Inspector Singh, meanwhile, landed in further trouble after his name cropped up in connection with the missing 1,400 cartons of illicit liquor from police strong room, as a probe found that “policemen had sold the seized liquor to gangster Yadav” — currently in the custody of police in connection with the fake dhaba encounter. Meerut additional district government counsel (ADGC) Shuchi Sharma said, “Singh surrendered in both the cases pending against him. His colleague Satish Kumar, a constable named in the fake encounter, also surrendered with him. Both policemen were sent to 14 days of judicial custody. They have applied for bail and the hearing for which is scheduled on April 13.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/etah-inspector-wanted-in-fake-encounter-missing-1-4k-liquor-cartons-cases-surrenders-before-anti-corruption-court-in-meerut/articleshow/82013524.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Trichy||Ignored in Trichy city too||Trichy: The reintroduction of Covid-19 restrictions by the state government to contain public movement amid rising cases is being widely ignored by locals in Trichy. Commercial places were crowded with people flouting distancing norms while two-wheeler riders plied without facemasks. While autorickshaws can only carry two passengers, several vehicles including share autos were seen commuting with beyond the permissible limit. “Commuting with only two people is highly impossible. How can a family with children travel in such a case,” asked K Veeramalai, an autorickshaw driver from Cantonment. Share autorickshaws were also crowded as they did not face any enforcement from the authorities. While standing travel has been banned in the buses from Saturday, city buses including private fleets had a significant number of passengers standing during peak hours. Crew members of city buses said they cannot stop passengers from boarding the bus even if the seats were filled. “We will end up in verbal altercations if we keep on telling people not to travel standing. Peak hours in the evening is difficult to enforce the restriction,” a conductor with TNSTC added. The adherence to facemask among the public did not witness any improvement either. As temples have been ordered to limit the visiting hours, the Arulmigu Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam denied entry to devotees after 7.30pm. “We are gradually penalising people venturing out without facemasks. Shops were warned to ensure social distancing or pay a heavy penalty for ignoring restrictions,” an official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/ignored-in-trichy-city-too/articleshow/82010111.cms||Deepak Karthik

The recurring traffic congestion in Trichy due to the incomplete RoB awaiting the defence land was apprised,” Thirunavukkarasar said. The MP added that the defence minister has assured to fulfil the request. Official sources in state highways department added that the ministry was keen on availing compensatory land in Hanumanthapuram village in Chengalpattu district instead of Manarpuram. Out of the six arms of the RoB, the department has completed five, all of which are in use but the major arm that connects the city’s neighbourhoods and other highways with Chennai-Trichy and Trichy-Madurai NHs is pending due to the delay in acquiring the land. Due to this, the RoB fails to decongest the city.The cost of completing the pending portion is estimated at Rs 3 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-mp-meets-defence-min-seeking-land-for-rob/articleshow/82010115.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Poll veteran, 3 first-timers tour booths, leave nothing to chance||Kolkata: O cinemai joto khushi natok koruk khoti nei, voter maidane natok na korlei holo (She can do as much drama as she wants in films, no harm, but should not do so in electoral battle), said Ratna Chatterjee, Trinamool’s Behala East candidate, taking a dig at her BJP opponent, Paayel Sarkar, who is an actress by profession. As Behala East as well as West went to the polls on Saturday, Ratna said, “I have decided to go wherever she goes. She has been creating scenes and influencing voters.” The Trinamool leader—she is the estranged wife of Sovan Chatterjee—complained to the EC, alleging Sarkar was meeting voters to influence them. But Paayel kept her cool and all she said was: “It is my job to inform the EC about any electoral malpractice, if any. I did only that. I visited places, where people had not been able to vote for the past 10 years. I am happy if my presence helped them overcome their fear.” On her way to Mullickpur, two bike-borne persons hurled bricks at Paayel’s car, shattering the rear windscreen. Apparently hardly perturbed, she merely changed her vehicle and left. For Trinamool and BJP candidates in both Behala East and West, it was a relentless run from one polling booth to another throughout the day, not taking any chance or letting complacency to set in. Each contestant kept tabs on his or her opponent and visited those spots to “boost the morale of voters”. Ratna, Paayel and Shrabanti Chatterjee—she is contesting from Behala West on BJP ticket against Trinamool minister Partha Chatterjee—were all first-time contenders but they never betrayed any sign of being a novice. War-veteran Partha, a four-time MLA, visited every booth in his constituency, where he diagnosed “least organizational weaknesses”. Shrabanti, also an actress, refused to call it a day without covering almost every booth in her constituency. “I kept lodging complaints with the EC against every little aberration. In Ward 126, some people were barred from voting as the polling agent of my opponent party drove them out. I ensured their complaints are recorded and a remedy is worked out,” said Shrabanti, who said it was immensely satisfying to fight the battle on her own. “None of the star campaigners, right from Smriti Irani to Mithun Chakraborty, was allowed to campaign for me.” As an exhausted Partha returned to his Behala Manton office after touring his constituency at the end of the day, he seemed confident about his fifth win from Behala West, which he said he had “nurtured like his daughter”. He never once said anything harsh about his opponents. On Shrabanti’s complaint about voters being debarred in Ward 126, he said, “She is a novice and is misguided by her partymen. I checked her complaint. Those voters’ names were listed in two booths. It is the EC to decide where they can vote.” The two constituencies, separated by Diamond Harbour Road, have seldom seen violence in general elections.

---||Agra||Etah inspector wanted in fake encounter & missing 1,400 liquor cartons cases surrenders before anti-corruption court in Meerut||MEERUT/AGRA: Inspector Indreshpal Singh, former SHO at Kotwali (Dehat) police station in Etah district, and constable Santosh Kumar surrendered at an anti-corruption court of special judge Narendra Pal Singh Tomar in Meerut. Singh is facing multiple charges, including a “fake encounter” and arrest of 10 people following a dispute over payment at a dhaba on March 4. While framing 10 innocent people, local police had alleged that they were part of a gang and had been hatching a robbery conspiracy. Police had also claimed to have arrested the accused after an encounter and seized six illegal weapons, 80 litres of illicit liquor and 2kg contraband from their possession. Following the dhaba owner’s complaint and TOI’s report, senior police officers in the Agra zone had intervened and an FIR against three policemen was registered on March 23 based on the findings of the preliminary probe. The case was subsequently transferred to neighbouring Aligarh district. One of the accused constables Shailendra Kumar and local liquor mafia Bantu Yadav were arrested on March 26, while inspector Singh and another constable Santosh Kumar kept dodging police. Inspector Singh, meanwhile, landed in further trouble after his name cropped up in connection with the missing 1,400 cartons of illicit liquor from police strong room, as a probe found that “policemen had sold the seized liquor to gangster Yadav” — currently in the custody of police in connection with the fake dhaba encounter. Meerut additional district government counsel (ADGC) Shuchi Sharma said, “Singh surrendered in both the cases pending against him. His colleague Satish Kumar, a constable named in the fake encounter, also surrendered with him. Both policemen were sent to 14 days of judicial custody. They have applied for bail and the hearing for which is scheduled on April 13.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/etah-inspector-wanted-in-fake-encounter-missing-1-4k-liquor-cartons-cases-surrenders-before-anti-corruption-court-in-meerut/articleshow/82008612.cms||Deepak Lavania

The agitators raised slogans against the government demanding that the drug be made immediately available for their family and friends who are undergoing Covid-19 treatment. As the people raised slogans, a police team rushed to the spot and managed to calm them down. Prashant Gawli from Niphad was one of the agitators demanding the injection for his family members. “This is my third day in Nashik city and I am still waiting to get the injections. Four of my family members are admitted to a hospital for Covid treatment and I need at least four remdesivir injections to start their treatment,” he said. Like Gawli, many others said that they have been visiting different medical shops for purchasing remdisivir drug, but in vain. “We are standing in long queues outside each medical store for nearly six hours everyday. Some of us have even formed tiny groups among ourselves wherein each one of us visits different stores for checking the availability of the drug. But, we are not getting the injections anywhere for the third consecutive day,”said Rajan Salve, a resident of Nashik city. Meanwhile, district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal said that the administration was making all efforts to make the injection available within the next few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/covid-patients-kin-agitate-for-remdesivir-injection/articleshow/82008620.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The local administration is cautiously optimistic that the curve shall begin to dip within the next 7-10 days. “Since the last week of March, the daily number of Covid cases has been hovering around the 1,100-mark despite the fact that we had ramped up our daily tests to around 10,000 — which was around 6,000-7,000 during the second and third week of March. The curve has started flattening in Jalgaon,” district collector Abhijit Raut told TOI. Raut added that for the first time since late February, there have been at least five days when the number of daily recoveries have exceeded the number of daily new cases. “We have been taking feedback from the hospitals and general physicians about the flow of patients with Covid-like symptoms at regular intervals. They have told us that flow has decreased of late,” added Raut. At present the positivity rate in Jalgaon is around 11%, which was about 13% in the second week of March. There are 11,709 active patients in the district — most of them under home isolation. As many as 515 patients are in the ICU. Raut maintained that given the highly infectious nature of the virus, the administration would not lower its guards and would continue with its aggressive testing, tracking and treatment protocol. He said the number of cases in hotspots like Chalisgaon, Chopda etc. has started dwindling. The Jalgaon city, a few pockets of Bhusawal, Erandol and Pachora continue to be the hotspots. The Jalgaon administration had undertaken a series of measures when cases started rising. The district collector ordered severe restrictions on movements of vehicles and operation of commercial establishments in the hotspots. “Like last year, the entire team of health workers, police and the civil administration have put their best foot forward to deal with the pandemic,” said Raut.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/covid-19-curve-is-beginning-to-flatten-in-jalgaon-dist-collector/articleshow/82008626.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Golu Kumar, 17, a native of Bihar, and Sattyam Kumar, 18, hailing from Uttar Pradesh, had gone for a swim along with another friend. However, both Golu and Sattyam were unable to judge the depth of the water and ventured into the deeper end of the waters and were seen struggling. The duo eventually drowned and, seeing this, the third friend, who was also struggling to swim to the banks, raised an alarm. Some passersby, hearing the call for help, rushed to the river bank and managed to save the third boy. However, it was too late to rescue Golu and Sattyam. The locals then informed the police about the incident, who the rushed to the spot and also summoned a team of fire and emergency services to the spot. By evening, personnel from the Bicholim fire station retrieved bodies of the two teenage boys. It is learnt that Golu and Sattyam were working at a bakery at Kudnem and resided in the vicinity. Over the last few years, quite a few cases of drowning have been reported on the same stretch of the river at Harvalem, as swimmers similarly venture into the water without understanding the depth of the water body. However, most of the drowning cases reported earlier had taken place during the monsoon and Friday’s case was a rare one that has occurred in the summer when the water is not in its full flow. Due to the rise in drowning cases, the tourism department now deploys police personnel during the monsoon season near waterfalls to prevent such untoward incidents from taking place. However, police personnel are not deployed during the summer as water flow is at its lowest level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/two-teenagers-meet-watery-grave-in-river-at-harvalem/articleshow/82010140.cms||---

---||Nashik||Maharashtra board exams: Fake exam postponement notice goes viral||NASHIK: The examination department of the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) has stumbled upon a fake notice, purportedly being the signatures of the dean and medical superintendent of the Solapur-based Dr. V M government medical college and hospital (GMCH), which claims that the upcoming first, second and third-year undergraduate exams for the health science courses have been postponed. The notice went viral on some social media platforms and some students contacted the controller of examinations Ajit Pathak to check the authenticity of the notice. The fake notice had made its way to the social media platforms just a couple of days after the varsity had announced the dates for these examinations on April 7. The MUHS had said that the exams would start from April 19 and continue till mid-May. In the fake notice, it was mentioned that the GMCH would not be able to conduct the exams since many in the examination department are suffering from Covid-19 and there are chances that others too may test positive. The notice went on to add that many students have been admitted to the hospital and some of them are critical. The exams scheduled in April and May are postponed and the new dates would be announced later. “I immediately got in touch with Sanjiv Thakur, the dean of the Solapur GMCH, and asked whether he had issued any such notice. He denied doing so and has now issued a circular denying that any such notice was sent out. The varsity has uploaded the circular on its official website,” said Pathak. He added that he has directed Thakur to complain about unknown persons at the local cyber police station. The varsity’s examination department had faced a similar situation last year when a fake circular on the timetable of the PG medical exams had gone viral. The officials had complained to the local police station in Nashik. “I fear that ‘misguided elements’ are behind this incident. But the exams would not be postponed. We have started our preparations,” said Pathak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/fake-exam-postponement-notice-goes-viral/articleshow/82024571.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Ahmedabad||Fugitive wanted for attempted murder held||Ahmedabad: Bapunagar police on Saturday arrested Pavan alias Kaliyo Nai, 25, a resident of Vihatnagar near Bhidbhanjan Hanuman, for his involvement in a case of attempted murder. Pavan was absconding since September. According to the Bapunagar police, the incident took place on September 8, 2020. Police said the complainant, Niraj Yadav, had gone with his son Daksh to an ice-cream shop when the accused told him not to play with his son. This led to an argument after which Pavan asked Niraj why he had taken one Poonam Datani to hospital after he was attacked. Niraj said Poonam was his friend and he hence took him for treatment. Pavan later left the area. At about 11pm, when Niraj was standing at a tea stall in Khodiyarnagar, he was approached by Ravi Nai who asked him if he had become a goon in the area. This led to more arguments after which Pavan and two others, Ravi and his friend Dipak Potaliya, attacked him. Police had arrested all the three — Ravi, Dipak and Pavan — two days after the incident, but Pavan was Covid positive and was admitted to Civil Hospital. Police said Pavan then escaped from Civil Hospital. Later, police got a tip-off about Pavan and he was arrested by Bapunagar police on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fugitive-wanted-for-attempted-murder-held/articleshow/82009739.cms||---
---||Surat||State crematoriums overflow with dead amid Covid-19 surge||Surat/Ahmedabad: All pyres in crematoriums across Diamond City of Surat are burning incessantly with more bodies waiting in queue for their turn. Such is the deluge that crematoriums are expanding their boundaries to accommodate the overflowing bodies. However, the state government on Saturday declared that only 14 people succumbed to Covid-19 in Surat. In fact, across the state, the highest 49 deaths due to Covid-19 were recorded, according to the state government bulletin. Last, 49 people had succumbed in the pandemic on May 5 when the first wave was at its peak. However, 49 appeared a small number considering there was a flood of dead people being brought to crematoriums across major cities of Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot. Let’s talk about numbers in Surat. Before the pandemic, Ramnath Ghela Crematorium (RGC), Umra and Kurukshetra Crematorium (KC) in Jahangirpura crematoriums received 20 bodies on average daily, but for the past two weeks, it has been receiving around 80 bodies. Ashwini Kumar Crematorium (AKC), Surat’s biggest one, used to attend to more than 30 bodies. But now it has been cremating 110 bodies on an average. AKC has nine gas furnaces in working condition and four stands for the wooden pyre.The three crematoriums are receiving more than threefold number of bodies daily for the past two weeks, said sources.Meanwhile, chief minister Vijay Rupani on Saturday denied reports that the state government was hiding the true data on the count of fatalities caused by the Covid-19 infection. “As per the guidelines of the ICMR, if a comorbid patient dies then a committee of experts decides the primary and secondary causes of such death. If that committee identifies the main cause of the death as heart attack then even though the patient was infected, such death is not counted caused by Covid. The same system is followed in the entire country,” he said in Ahmedabad.As per the state health government, Gujarat’s overall Covid-19 toll stood at 4,746 as on Saturday.But viral videos of bodies waiting in queue at AKC put the government under pressure to make alternate arrangements to reduce scrutiny. An adjoining ground of RGC in Umra has turned into a crematorium and SMC teams on Saturday afternoon set up light poles and other infrastructure for emergency use there. “Those dying natural death are being cremated on a wooden pyre. Light poles are also being installed there so that the cremation can continue even at night,” said an SMC employee at the spot.Similar facility is also being made at Jahangirpura where they have set up new stands for wooden pyre on the bank of river Tapi.In Rajkot too, deaths continue in double digits across hospitals but according to the district collector office’s release of 89 people who died during Covid treatment in Rajkot district, only 14 succumbed to the virus from April 6 to 8. But as per rule all 89 dead have been cremated as per Covid protocol.Meanwhile, trustees of the biggest crematorium of the Rajkot, Ramnathpara crematorium, maintain that they are cremating 20 bodies as per Covid protocol daily, and 15 other bodies of non-Covid deaths.In Ahmedabad, some 25 bodies of Covid-deceased were cremated at Vadaj, Dudheshwar and Thaltej crematoriums on Saturday. As per records, 16 Covid-19 deaths were reported in Ahmedabad district. While the state government’s health bulletin on Friday stated that there were six deaths in Vadodara, the bulletin issued locally by Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) mentioned only two.Officials, however, have defended the death toll saying that the bulletin reports numbers of persons who die primarily due to Covid-19 and as decided by the death audit committee. Also the bodies cremated in any crematorium also include suspected Covid persons as well as other non-Covid deaths, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/state-crematoriums-overflow-with-dead-amid-covid-19-surge/articleshow/82009416.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Nashik||Traffic police to check RT-PCR reports of auto drivers||Nashik: The city traffic police has decided to start checking rickshaw drivers from Sunday to ensure that they have conducted RT-PCR tests and carry reports with them. The state government has made it mandatory for non-vaccinated people from various sectors, including public and private transport workers. ACP (Traffic) Seetaram Gaikwad said that they would start checking rickshaw drivers from Sunday though the rule came into effect from Sunday. Rickshaw drivers come in contact with a large number of people everyday. Thus, if they have contracted the virus, they naturally become super-spreaders of Covid-19. Hence, the state government has issued an order to conduct their RT-PCR tests as part of precautionary measures to break the chain of virus transmission. However, on the other hand, many rickshaw drivers said that they did not have any knowledge about carrying RT-PCR reports if they have not taken the vaccine. Prakash Kadjekar, a rickshaw driver, said that they have only been instructed not to carry more than two passengers at a given time and we were not informed anything about carrying RT-PCR test reports. President of Shramik Autorickshaw and Taxi Union, Nashik, Bhagwan Pathak said, “We have also learned it through newspapers that RT-PCR tests have been made mandatory for autorickshaw drivers if they have not taken Covid vaccine. However, no one from the administration has approached us about the issue.” “Had we been told, we would have definitely spread information about the same among rickshaw drivers,” added Pathak. There are over 20,000 rickshaws plying in Nashik city. Meanwhile, a large number of rickshaws remained off road on Saturday owing to complete lockdown in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/traffic-police-to-check-rt-pcr-reports-of-auto-drivers/articleshow/82008632.cms||Santosh Sonawane

His distraught family searched for him and lodged a missing complaint at the local thana. The search expanded to as far as Bihar and Madhya Pradesh but to no avail. On Friday, Baljit Singh, his son, was informed that his father had been found in Uttar Pradesh’s Moradabad. Finally, the “lost” man, now 65 years old, was reunited with his son and family and on Saturday, the father-son duo left for home. This reunion would not have been possible without the efforts of sub-inspector Manoj Kumar who spotted an injured Moni Singh, who was rendered unconscious after an accident, lying on the Moradabad-Delhi national highway. Sub-inspector Kumar took him to the district hospital for first-aid and learnt he did not know where to go from there. A patient Kumar gradually coaxed him to say who he was and where he came from. Speaking with TOI, Manoj Kumar, posted at Mundha Pandey police station of Moradabad, said, “I managed to get some information from him. His speech was not coherent. I could only learn his name and that he was from Ahmedgarh in Punjab.” Then, he contacted the Punjab police, sharing Moni’s photograph and details. “They confirmed that a man named Moni Singh had gone missing some 13 years ago and a complaint had been registered at the Ahmedgarh police station. Punjab police helped to get in touch with Ahmedgarh police and through them, the village head.” In less than 24 hours, Moni’s son Baljit was on way to Moradabad to meet his father. “We had given up all hope of seeing him again. We lost him completely. We are very happy to have him back and want to look after him. Everyone in the family, including my mother, brother and three sisters are waiting for him. We will be celebrating this day,” said Baljit, a wage labourer, before leaving. “I just tried to help the family in the line of duty and it proved to be fruitful. I am glad,” Manoj Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/13-yrs-on-moradabad-si-helps-reunite-lost-man-with-family-in-punjab-son-arrives-to-take-him-home/articleshow/82008638.cms||Maria Khan

From providing free electricity up to 200 units to free rides in public buses for women, he said many Aam Aadmi Party’s measures in Delhi were being mentioned by BJP and Congress as poll promises in other states. “Recently, while campaigning in West Bengal, Union home minister Amit Shah promised free electricity up to 200 units should BJP be elected to power. In Kerala, the party promised free public transport for women, and in Tamil Nadu, it said it will bring in a model of governance that’s similar to what can be seen in Delhi,” Sisodia said at a press conference. “In Assam, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi has promised free electricity. Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has announced free rides for women in public buses despite the fact that there aren’t enough public buses in Punjab,” he said. Sisodia claimed that Delhi has become a paragon of governance and development in every sphere. Referring to a recent interaction of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with chief ministers on Covid management, the deputy CM said: “Even PM Modi has insisted upon the relevance of home isolation and how it’s a strong line of defence in containing Covid; he mentioned the importance of creating micro-containment zones across the country,” adding that home isolation for Covid patients first began in Delhi in the country. The lieutenant governor, who comes under the Centre, had stopped home isolation last year and made five days institutional quarantine mandatory for all positive cases. Home isolation was restored after Kejriwal took up the matter with the LG. Sisodia, however, accused BJP of putting hurdles in the path of the AAP government in Delhi. “BJP is following and adopting the Arvind Kejriwal model in other states, but when it comes to the capital, they only want to put hurdles in our path and prevent any development work,” he said. The deputy CM further said that when AAP had announced free electricity upto 200 units in Delhi, BJP had opposed the scheme. “AAP sincerely hopes there won’t be any more hurdles in our road to development,” Sisodia said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/parties-copying-kejriwal-model-says-sisodia/articleshow/82010135.cms||---

The relatives had made arrangements for the last rites at home before leaving. It’s learnt that the woman was admitted at the hospital with Covid-19 symptoms. Though hospital authorities claimed she was positive for the virus, her family members told the police that the woman’s RT-PCR test result was yet to come when the drama unfolded. The family members of the woman in question were handed a ‘death certificate’ and other documents stating she was dead. The blunder came to the fore when the family members clamoured to see her face before taking her purported body away. They were surprised after seeing the body, which was of someone else. The family members frantically rushed to the ward, where they found her alive. The enraged family members later asked the hospital authorities to discharge her so that they could take her somewhere else. The drama did not end there. Hospital sources claimed the patient’s relatives and some political workers allegedly forced hospital authorities to part with the documents and medical records of the woman, before whisking her away from the Covid ward to home in a car, after the ruckus. Hospital authorities have claimed that the patient’s relatives did not settle the bill before leaving. According to a hospital source, the mistake was by a staffer who was on night duty. “The jaded employee in the night shift by mistake attached the documents of the alive woman to the file of a dead patient, which triggered the chaos,” said a highly placed source from the hospital, which did not want to pursue any criminal charges against the woman’s kin. Senior inspector of Wadi police station S Durge said the matter was under inquiry after the woman’s kin filed a complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ready-for-last-rites-awaiting-body-family-finds-woman-alive/articleshow/82010143.cms||Soumitra Bose

Patients who experience difficulty in breathing or their oxygen level has dropped apart from other Covid symptoms are admitted to the DCHCs. These centres also have swab sample collection facilities with 1,840 samples already in the process of being testing through the RT-PCR method. Every bed in these DCHCs is equipped with oxygen supply and each of the DCHCs has two ventilators. As of date, a total of 18 patients are on ventilators in these DCHCs. There are more than 90 ventilators beds available in the DCHCs in rural areas. According to Pawar, of the 1,251 patients currently admitted to DCHCs, 18 are put on ventilators while 809 require oxygen support. The oxygen is currently available in good number in the rural areas. The rest of the patients may require oxygen and local doctors treating them are taking call as and when required.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/about-74-oxygen-beds-occupied-in-rural-areas/articleshow/82008647.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The woman was lying bleeding on the Dhamangaon stretch of the busy highway around 10.45pm on Thursday, and passersby called Wada police chowky and alerted them, he said. “Bhiwandi police rushed in and got her hospitalised. Our probe has found that her name is Ruksana Pathan and she lived with her child at her parents’ place following a fight with her husband, who slit her throat along with an accomplice,” he said. They dumped Ruksana on the highway under the cover of darkness, thinking she was dead, he said, adding that the duo was yet to be arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-throat-slit-by-hubby-woman-dumped-on-road-survives/articleshow/82010162.cms||---

The officials said that people are being asked to remain indoors and not step out without any valid reason. Since the unlock, people have returned to their normal routine and the markets too remained open till late night. Putting everybody inside before 10pm will be a challenge for the administration. On Saturday, Dehradun district magistrate Ashish Srivastava issued orders imposing the night curfew. Supply of essential supplies, petroleum and gas, people travelling to railway stations, bus stands and the airport will be exempted. Permission for travel between the restricted hours has also been extended to labourers and workers involved in public utility and construction work while people working in industrial units will be able to travel by showing their identity cards. In addition, vehicles travelling to other districts via Dehradun will be allowed to run during the curfew. And people attending weddings will be allowed upon showing invitation cards. Meanwhile, Uttarakhand director general of police (DGP) Ashok Kumar told TOI, "Police are going to enforce the order regarding night curfew in the municipal area of Dehradun from April 10. People roaming unnecessarily will be booked under relevant sections of Disaster Management Act and Epidemic Diseases Act. Essential services will be allowed to operate." "We are penalising over 5,000 people on a daily basis for the violation ofCovid-19 norms," DGP Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/imposing-night-curfew-in-doon-a-challenge-for-police-admin/articleshow/82009387.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Pune||Centre to allocate 1,121 ventilators to state, 165 for Pune: Javadekar||Pune: Union minister Prakash Javadekar on Saturday said the Centre would be sending 1,121 ventilators to the state, including 165 for Pune. “The ventilators would be distributed to the state in the next three days. A total of 700 ventilators would come from Gujarat and the remaining 421 from Andhra Pradesh,” Javdekar said after attending the weekly Covid review meeting of the district at the Council Hall, convened by deputy chief minister and Pune guardian minister Ajit Pawar. Javdekar said the Centre would help the state in procuring oxygen from various industrial units across the country. He also said funds would be allocated under the National Health Mission (NHM) to fill up the vacant posts of officials for carrying out testing and tracing in the state. The Union minister said a team under IAS officer Kunal Kumar was preparing a report based on the central team’s observations while visiting the 30 districts in the state and it would be implemented in Maharashtra. Amid reports of acute shortage of vaccine doses in the state, Javdekar said Maharashtra was next to Gujarat and Rajasthan in terms of vaccine allocation. He said, “According to the Friday’s report prepared by the Centre, the state has been allocated 1.1 crore doses so far. Of them, 95 lakh doses have been utilised till date. The remaining 15.63 lakh doses at various transit points should be distributed immediately.” Javdekar said he had spoken to the Maharashtra chief secretary, Sitaram Kunte, on the issue. The Union minister said he did not want to get involved in any blame game regarding vaccine doses. He said the focus right now was on dealing with the current situation. “When we shall have to do politics, we shall give proper answers to the allegations. There is nothing greater than the interest of the people in the current situation,” he said. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said in the current situation, the Centre should give the assured doses to the state without politicising the issue. He also said the doses Javadekar mentioned must be at different transit points and would be distributed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/centre-to-allocate-1121-ventilators-to-state-165-for-pune-javadekar/articleshow/82010148.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Mumbai||At 21,094, vaccine shots in Mumbai go down by half||MUMBAI: On Saturday, the first day of the weekend lockdown, the city witnessed a curtailed vaccination drive with only 21,094 Mumbaikars getting their shots as against more than double that number on most days. The curtailed drive was necessitated due to a shortage of vaccines across the state. In Mumbai, the BMC told private hospitals not to vaccinate till April 12 or use up their residual stock. The BMC vaccine statistics for Saturday showed that only 331 people took their shots in Mumbai’s private hospitals as against the 12,002 who did so on Thursday. So far, 16.35 lakh vaccine shots have been given in Mumbai since the vaccination drive started on January 16. It was unclear whether the state managed to breach the one crore vaccination mark on Saturday as data was still being compiled at the time of going to the press. On Friday, the state managed a little over half of its usual quota with 2.72 lakh shots, taking the total to 96 lakh. Across the country, 9.8 crore shots have been given, with Maharashtra leading other states. National Health Mission director N Ramaswami said that eight lakh vaccine doses were likely to reach the state on Sunday. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said that the state currently has nine lakh vaccine doses, which would suffice for fewer than three days. He said the Centre had been sending stock in small quantities, which has been making it difficult for the administration to plan for the week. “We have said we require 40 lakh doses per week, and if that is supplied regularly in one batch, it will be possible to plan for the week and keep the vaccination pace brisk,” said Tope. In Pune, Union minister Prakash Javadekar said Maharashtra has a stock in hand of 15.63 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccine and the same should be optimally distributed. “Boards like ‘Vaccination centre closed due to no stock’ should not be visible and I have spoken about this with state chief secretary Sitaram Kunte,” he said. The minister said the pandemic was a “national issue” and it is time now for all to work together and not engage in politicising the issues.

The accused was being tried for the alleged rape of a British woman at Palolem, Cancona in 2018. Speaking to TOI, crime branch superintendent of police (SP) Shobit Saksena said that on September 22, 2020, undertrial Yelappa escaped from the jail. Saksena said that it was for the second time the undertrial had escaped from custody, the first being in 2019 while being taken to a court in Margao. Subsequently, he was apprehended at Bangalore. “Under close monitoring, a joint team of the crime branch and the North Goa police worked on the case. Based on intensive technical surveillance and actionable ground level of human intelligence, important leads were developed for the search of accused in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.  Ultimately, between April 9 and 10, 2021, he was apprehended from Hoskote in Karnataka and placed under arrest, Saksena said. “Yelappa is uneducated and used to earn his livelihood by working as a driver and sometimes as a casual labourer,” he said. “Over the time, he became a habitual criminal and resorted to thefts and burglaries. In 2018, he committed the alleged rape of the British national. He is wanted in a burglary case in Bangalore and has involvement in five cases. He is married and has five siblings, who live in Hosur and Bangalore,” Saksena said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/undertrial-who-escaped-from-colvale-found-in-karnataka/articleshow/82010165.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||A welfare scheme that never took off||Thiruvananthapuram: Even as the outgoing LDF government has been claiming to have introduced several welfare schemes, a project for providing financial relief to the public that was launched with much ado, never took off though the order for it was issued in 2016. The government announced the Jana Santhwanam scheme immediately after it assumed power and it was touted as a counter to the former UDF government's popular Jana Samparkam programme. Records accessed by TOI shows that actions are yet to be taken on as many as 3,48,650 applications that were received in various district collectorates and the secretariat, seeking assistance under the scheme. The programme was announced originally on October 5, 2016. The announcement sparked a huge response and public started pouring into various district collectorates for applying for financial assistance under the scheme. However, the government issued the relevant order for the scheme only on January 4, 2017. As per the order issued by the then additional chief secretary (finance) K M Abraham, as government funds were insufficient for spending on the welfare of the public, especially those who are side-lined in the society, funds were being raised with the participation of the public and will be utilised for the welfare of deserving applicants under various categories like for treatment, finding means for livelihood, for those who do not have houses, those who are financially backward, and for rehabilitation of those living in poramboke land, etc. The order also said that financial aid that would be provided for each category, ranging from Rs 10,000-Rs 3.5 lakh. The government announced that the applications could be given directly to the chief minister, finance minister, chief secretary, additional chief secretary (finance) or the district collectors seeking assistance from the fund. The public response was so overwhelming that a woman even lost her life in Kattakada, after being crushed in the crowd who turned up to applying for assistance under the scheme. As per the records, the capital district received the highest number of applications (2,00,050). However, the government subsequently launched multiple schemes like the Life Mission and Ardram Mission with elements that overlapped with the objectives of the Jana Santwanam scheme, because of which it decided to modify the criteria for the scheme. “It is a classic example of bureaucratic red tape. The file that recommended modifications to the scheme began travelling from the top to the bottom of the official chain of multiple departments, with multiple queries about whom to provide the assistance and what should be the criteria,” a senior official with the finance department said. This could never be decided in the last four-and-a-half years, because of which all the applications received by the government from the public are still lying without any action being on them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/a-welfare-scheme-that-never-took-off/articleshow/82009755.cms||KP Saikiran

The country took 85 days to cross the milestone, while the US took 89 days and China 103 days. On Saturday, around 29.65 lakh doses were given till 8pm taking the total doses so far to 10.12 crore. While 8.86 crore doses were given as first dose, 1.26 crore people are now fully vaccinated. “The extension of vaccine coverage to those above 45 years along with the recent provisions for them to get vaccinated at their workplaces (govt and private) form a series of pro-active, collaborative and coordinated steps taken by the Centre and the state governments,” the health ministry said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/10-crore-doses-in-85-days-india-beats-us-in-pace/articleshow/82011117.cms||---

So far, three rhino calves have died in the past one year -- two of them this year. There are 42 rhinos located across two areas in Dudhwa at present. Manoj Sonkar, deputy director, Dudhwa, told TOI, “The staff saw a bull fighting with the mother of the calf, possibly wanting to mate with her. The calf was probably hurt as they fought and it got stuck in a swampy area. When our staff saw no movement in the calf, a rescue team was sent and it was found to be dead. There were no signs of poaching as all organs were intact. It was an accident.” He added that an autopsy conducted by a panel of experts on Saturday revealed suffocation as the cause of death possibly because the calf got stuck in a swampy area after it was hurt during the infighting by adults. "There is a high risk to juveniles because of carnivores, infection and other factors like infighting. Our staff is closely monitoring the area to secure the forests but such factors like infighting and attack by carnivores can’t be controlled,” Sonkar said. On March 14, 2020, a three-month-old calf was killed by a tiger in Sonaripur while another calf was killed on January 27, this year by a tiger in the same range. Though calves are not included in the census report till they are a year old, a calf death is a setback for the “rhino phase 2” programme as this panchyderm’s count has remained the same since 2018. Rhinos were first translocated from Assam to Dudhwa in 1984 and kept in a 27-sq-km enclosure in Kakraha in Sonaripur range. In 2018, Dudhwa successfully launched it second rhino rehabilitation programme by shifting three cows and one bull from Sonaripur to a 20-km enclosure in DTR’s Belraya range.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/dudhwa-loses-3rd-rhino-calf-in-one-year-was-injured-as-adults-fought/articleshow/82008661.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Kolkata||First time since the 1980s, Sovan absent as Behala goes to vote||Kolkata: For the first time in his political career of over three decades, former Kolkata mayor Sovan Chatterjee on Saturday chose to stay away from the polling booth at Parnasree in Behala East, where he used to hog the limelight. In past 10 years Parnasree residents never missed the sight of the former minister visiting the booth as a voter amid tight security. But on Saturday, Chatterjee, who used to live in Parnasree, stayed confined to his Golpark flat. Though his security personnel were ready to escort him to Parnasree, he finally decided “not to vote”. “We were expecting him at the booth at least as a voter. But he didn’t turn up,” said a Trinamool leader and friend of Chatterjee. The former mayor did not answer calls. After joining the BJP, Chatterjee on March 14 quit the party after being denied a ticket from his traditional Behala East assembly seat. The BJP instead fielded actor Paayel Sarkar from the seat, where Chatterjee’s estranged wife, Ratna has been fielded by Trinamool. Sovan had apparently wanted to take on Ratna at Behala East and also sought a ticket for companion Baisakhi Banerjee from Behala West. But BJP reportedly told him they could only accommodate him and, that too, from Behala West, not wanting the poll to turn into a family feud. Ratna was surprised at her estranged husband not voting on Saturday. “I can’t recollect an election when he did not vote. He used to eat, drink and breathe politics. I feel pity for him,” she said. Chatterjee had been a councillor in the KMC since 1985. From 2000 to 2005, he was the MMiC. Chatterjee won the Behala East assembly seat in 2011 and retained it in 2016. He was the KMC mayor from 2010 to 2018 and simultaneously held the charge of various portfolios, including housing, environment and fire.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/first-time-since-the-1980s-sovan-absent-as-behala-goes-to-vote/articleshow/82009756.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Nagpur||Vaccine numbers drop by 50% in division, up in district||NAGPUR: The vaccination numbers in the Nagpur division dropped by nearly 50% from what they were just a couple of days back. On Saturday, the six districts recorded 35,517 inoculations while nearly the same number of beneficiaries had taken the jab in Nagpur district alone on Monday. On April 8, just when the vaccine shortage started looming, the Nagpur division under the deputy director of health services (DDHS) had recorded over 67,000 inoculations in a day. On the other hand, vaccination in the Nagpur city limits picked up, with public centres witnessing good turnout. The drive had slowed down in the last couple of days. Yet, abysmal performance was reported from rural areas which collectively managed to inoculate just 4,183 people. Gondia, which starting running short of doses earlier this week, didn’t administer the second dose under any category of beneficiaries. The district received some supply of vaccines which helped it administer over 4,000 first doses to all types of beneficiaries. In Nagpur, though the administration claimed to have received around 15,000 doses of Covaxin, the indigenous jab was given only at the Government Medical College and Hospital. None of the private and other centres restarted Covaxin as per the district and civic data. Of the overall inocuations, 62% beneficiaries belonged to the 45+ group, which accounted for 22,099 jabs in the day. Also, 1,300 healthcare workers (HCWs) and frontline workers (FLWs) came forward to take their first doses, though they had become eligible on January 17 itself. The government had stopped vaccination for HCWs and FLWs after it came to the fore that some ineligible beneficiaries had taken the jab in violation of norms. Two days back, the curbs were lifted with the condition that these FLWs and HCWs can get the jab through on-site registration, only at public inoculation centres. They also need to give an undertaking as well as employer’s certificate. These conditions were not there initially. Health officials said there was no vaccine stock left in the division and no doses were left in any of the depot at DDHS, corporation or district depots. As per civic officials, the stocks available with centres would last till Monday. Public centres will remain closed on Sunday while the drive goes on at private centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vaccine-numbers-drop-by-50-in-division-up-in-district/articleshow/82009753.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Hyderabad||Cannot hold 25 sailors to ransom, says seafarers’ union||HYDERABAD: As investigation into the Suez Canal incident involving ‘Ever Given’ by Suez Canal Authority (SCA) in Egypt continues, National Union of Seafarers of India (NUSI) said that the 25 Indian seafarers on board cannot be held to ransom if there was a delay in settling the issue of losses with ship owners or others concerned. “We would neither like to get involved or interfere in the investigations nor do we want to prejudice the investigation. But, we will certainly react and respond to a situation if Indian seafarers need to be assisted,” NUSI general secretary-cum-treasurer Abdulgani Serang told STOI. He said this is not a piracy situation and seafarers cannot be held to ransom. “If the SCA has suffered losses, they can sort it out with those involved with the ship but that cannot haul up seafarers in any manner,” Serang said. SCA chairman Admiral Osama Rabie and advisor Sayed Sheashya, who are heading the committee to investigate the reasons for the giant container ship running aground, have estimated revenue losses at $1 billion as Ever Given was stuck in the canal for six days. SCA is in talks with the shipping company but said if the issue was not resolved amicably, it could lead to a civil dispute. Ever Given ran aground on March 23 and was refloated on March 29. The ship was then taken to the Great Bitter Lake in the Suez Canal area where an investigation is being conducted. The crew have been on board the ship since then with an additional captain, also from India, joining them aboard on April 4. Serang said he had a conversation with the master of the ship but it was only for a short while. “I assured him that we will stand by the seafarers and would extend all support required,” he said. Serang said the seafarers were relaxed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cannot-hold-25-sailors-to-ransom-says-seafarers-union/articleshow/82009899.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Mercury soars but water ATMs remain neglected||HYDERABAD: Despite weather officials hinting that temperatures in the April and May could go higher than usual, even touching 45 degree Celsius or above in Hyderabad and other areas, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has done little to revive the water ATMs that are broken or have stopped functioning. STOI visited several water ATM kiosks and found that in many of them — at NTR Marg, Karmanghat, BS Maqta, Yousufguda and Musheerabad — coin slots had been damaged, outlet pipes broken and steel tumblers, which were chained to the taps, stolen. Commuters, roadside vendors and the homeless who pass by these defunct water ATMs say they see the structures are of little use to them as they do not fulfil their intended purpose. M Narsamma, a fruit vendor near NTR Marg said, “If there is a need for these water ATMs, it is now when the summer temperatures are at their peak. This machine worked properly for around two months after it was launched and then it stopped working. The structure had been broken by some miscreants and the coin slot also doesn’t work. It is simply occupying space on the footpath.” The aim of this ambitious water ATM project of Telangana government was to provide affordable and clean drinking water to people. One glass of water cost Rs 1 and while charge for a litre was set at Rs 2, meaning Rs 20 could fetch a person 20 litres of water when the machines were first introduced. “As per the information we have, it is a policy decision taken by the government. Since drinking water is being provided through Mission Bhagiratha project, this Water ATM project has been discontinued,” a senior GHMC official told STOI. Within a year after the project started, several water ATMs, like the one near NTR Marg, have become dysfunctional. The project was intended to benefit 1.5 lakh people through 250 water ATMs. Before many of these machines went defunct, civic authorities had managed to install nearly 150 of them across the city. At the Sanathnagar bus depot, another water ATM has been defunct for over two years. “There used to be a water ATM at the bus stand. We used to get chilled water from there but it stopped working. No one even came to repair it. For several days, people who pass by used to put in coins and return disappointed,” said G Prakruthi, a college student. When the issue was raised with water board officials, they said the board is only responsible for supplying water to the ATMs. While agreeing that none of the Water ATMs in the city are functioning, Vamshi Krishna, GHMC’s Khairatabad deputy commissioner said, “I will discuss the issue with our senior officials and find out the plan of action.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mercury-soars-but-water-atms-remain-neglected/articleshow/82009840.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Surat||State crematoriums overflow with dead amid Covid-19 surge||Surat/Ahmedabad: All pyres at crematoriums in four major cities of Gujarat — Surat, Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Rajkot — are burning incessantly with more bodies waiting in queue for their turn. Such is the deluge that crematoriums are expanding their boundaries to accommodate the bodies, though the state government said only 49 Covid deaths were recorded across Gujarat on Saturday, taking its overall Covid toll to 4,746.Last time 49 people had succumbed to Covid on a single day on May 5, 2020, when the first wave was at its peak.In Surat, before the pandemic, Ramnath Ghela Crematorium (RGC), Umra, and Kurukshetra Crematorium (KC), Jahangirpura, used to receive 20 bodies on average daily, but for the past two weeks, they have been receiving around 80 bodies. Ashwini Kumar Crematorium (AKC), Surat’s biggest one, used to attend to more than 30 bodies, but now it has been cremating 110 bodies on average daily. AKC has nine gas furnaces in working condition and four stands for the wooden pyre.Meanwhile, chief minister Vijay Rupani on Saturday denied reports that the state government was hiding the true Covid death data. “As per the guidelines of the ICMR, if a comorbid patient dies, then a committee of experts decides the primary and secondary causes of death. If that committee identifies the main cause of the death as heart attack, then even though the patient was infected with coronavirus, such death is not counted as Covid death. The same system is followed in the entire country,” he said in Ahmedabad. This may explain how more ‘Covid-19 dead’ bodies are reaching crematoriums through Covid-protocol but may not be labelled as Covid-19 deaths. Meanwhile, viral videos of bodies waiting in queue at AKC put the government under pressure to make alternative arrangements to reduce scrutiny. An adjoining ground of RGC has turned into a crematorium and Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) teams on Saturday afternoon set up light poles and other infrastructure for emergency use there. “Those dying natural deaths are being cremated on a wooden pyre. Light poles are being installed so that cremation can continue even at night,” said an SMC employee at the spot.Similar facility is also being created at Jahangirpura, where the authorities have set up new stands for wooden pyre on the bank of river Tapi.In Rajkot too, deaths continue in double digits across hospitals. However, according to the district collector’s office, of the 89 people who died during Covid treatment between April 6 and 8, only 14 succumbed to the coronavirus, though all the dead were cremated as per Covid protocol.Trustees of the biggest crematorium of Rajkot — Ramnathpara crematorium — maintain that they are cremating 20 bodies as per Covid protocol daily.In Ahmedabad, estimated two dozen bodies were cremated at Vadaj, Dudheshwar and Thaltej crematoriums as per Covid protocol on Saturday, though only 16 deaths due to coronavirus were reported in the district.While the state government’s health bulletin on Friday stated that there were six deaths in Vadodara, the bulletin issued locally by Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) mentioned only two.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/state-crematoriums-overflow-with-dead-amid-covid-19-surge/articleshow/82009433.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Scramble for remdesivir unfounded, no impact on Covid-19 mortality||PUNE: The rush to get a dose of remdesivir, an antiviral drug, for the treatment of Covid-19 patients at hospitals is unfounded as it does not have an impact on mortality, said leading doctors and state task for members. The drug, which was originally developed for the treatment of hepatitis and later tried during the Ebola, MERS pandemics, does not have life-saving impact on Covid-19 patients and only helps in reducing the hospital stay by two-three days, doctors said. The Indian Council of Medical Research has given out guidelines about the use of remdesivir. Doctors said that it cannot be used in a blanket format and is beneficial only in the first 10 days of the infection. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state task force on Covid-19, said that people should not panic if they do not find the drug in the current scenario as it has not been found to have any impact on mortality. “The rush for the drug is unfounded. It has restrictions in its use and should be given only in first nine days. It is a drug that only reduces viral replication in the body. It does not have the potential to reduce mortality. None of the studies done across the world have shown its benefit in reducing mortality,” he said. He said that the use of remdesivir has shown a reduction in hospital stay for a patient by one to three days and doctors may be preferring it to make beds available for other patients in the current scenario. He added that they had advised advised doctors on the judicious use of the drug. A senior doctor, another member of the state advisory group, said that at the moment, favipiravir is the only other antiviral recommended next to remdesivir. He said that doctors often depend on their experience with any drug while prescribing medication. However, favipiravir has better impact if given in the first 5-6 days of the infection. Scientific papers state that favipiravir was first used against SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan. Then, as the pandemic spread to Europe, this drug received approval for emergency use in Italy, Japan, Russia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Moldova, and Kazakhstan. In June 2020, favipiravir received the DCGI approval in India for mild and moderate COVID-19 infections. Dr Ajay Godse, MD chest medicine from Bhaktivedanta hospital in Thane district, felt that remdesivir had worked in almost 95% administered the drug, while cautioning that it should not be considered a “miracle drug” . “Prolonged viremia, which means longer presence of the virus in the body, requires medication in the form of antivirals. We found that remdesivir worked in our patients. It is a good drug but definitely not a miracle drug. One should not pin their hopes on remdesivir alone,” he said. He added that they had used favipiravir in May last year, because it was a oral medicine and showed hope in treatment. However, they found it to be weaker compared to remdesivir and useful only within first five-six days of infection. “Considering its impact on kidney functioning and uric acid generation in the body, we have not used it hence,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-scramble-for-remdesivir-unfounded-no-impact-on-covid-19-mortality/articleshow/82010517.cms||Swatee Kher
---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Wedding raided for violating covid norms||VADODARA: The second wave of Covid-19 may have led to major panic in the entire state, but there are some who seem to ignorant of the situation. The Padra police registered an offence regarding a wedding celebration where around 400 persons had gathered and a dance and music event was being held. Officials of the Padra police were on patrolling duty to ensure implementation of Covid guidelines when they were informed about a large-scale wedding in the town at the Shri Rang Farm. The policemen reached the venue with witnesses and found that a performer was dancing to live music on a stage that could even be used to hold a concert with stars. The gathering was in violation of the notification prohibiting gatherings of more than 100 persons. The police registered an offence against Faruk Malek who had organised the event for his daughter’s wedding. A complaint regarding the incident states that when the police asked Malek about the violation, he said that he was not aware of the restrictions. The police registered an offence under provisions of the Indian Penal Code as well as the Disaster Management Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/wedding-raided-for-violating-covid-norms/articleshow/82009080.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Second wave more severe, hitting younger people badly||PANAJI: While the first wave of Covid-19 saw mostly senior citizens getting sick from the infection, the currently-underway second wave has thrown up some rude surprises for younger people. Across the state, persons in their 30s are ending up in hospital with severe illness. “Compared to the first phase, we are getting younger patients with extensive pneumonia,” said leading pulmonologist Dr Haradatt Karande. What’s worse is that the patients are presenting late, usually a week into the illness. “Patients are coming to us five to six days late, and with complications that make our task difficult,” said Goa Medical College (GMC) dean Dr S M Bandekar. It’s the same story across Goa. “We are seeing more patients who are in their 30s and 40s,” said Dr Anil Mehndiratta, part of the Covid management team at SMRC, Chicalim. “There’s been a huge upsurge in cases, and I strongly feel that vaccination should be thrown open for the younger generation at the earliest, because they are the source of infection. They will pass it on to elders in their families, and the elders are going to die. Vaccinating the younger generation will prevent the spread of the virus.” Head of GMC’s pulmonory department, Dr Durga Lawande, said that young people are more exposed to the infection because they fall in the economic productive group. “They don’t have the option of staying home,” she said. “So we are probably now seeing more young people contracting the infection.” She said that people are taking the virus lightly, and only when their fever doesn’t subside or their condition worsens do they decide to go for testing. Others still avoid getting tested, she said. “On contracting the virus, a person may get low or moderate grade fever in the first week, along with some respiratory symptoms,” she said. “He is fine for a week, but in the second week, he starts getting a fever again. That’s the time he realises that something is wrong, and he goes for testing.” “By then, he has wasted a lot of time. That’s the time complications have set in, with the patient developing pneumonia, impacting his lungs. He will require oxygen and various grades of therapy,” she said. Lawande insisted that even if one gets a fever for one day, they should immediately get tested, as delays lead to complications. “We have a 40-year-old woman who is on oxygen, and we have been trying hard to get her out of it. Maybe the virus has become more virulent,” said Mehndiratta. Karande, the pulmonologist, said that patients are showing up with symptoms not commonly seen during the first wave. “A lot of Covid patients are reporting non-specific symptoms such as no fever but cough or diarrhoea, vomiting with abdominal pain, etc,” he said. Mehndiratta said that many patients are presenting with complaints of diarrhoea or gastroenteritis. “While we saw Covid patients suffering from diarrhoea in the first wave, it wasn’t the primary symptom of the virus,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/second-wave-more-severe-hitting-younger-people-badly/articleshow/82010159.cms||Bindiya Chari

The India Meteorological Department (IMD), Hyderabad on Saturday issued thunderstorm warning for several districts from April 11 to April 14. As per IMD, districts such as Hyderabad, Rangareddy, Medchal-Malkajgiri, Adilabad, Asifabad, Mancherial, Nirmal, Jagtial, Peddapalli, Karimnagar, Sircilla, Nizamabad, Kamareddy, Sangareddy, Medak, Vikarabad, Narayanpet, Mahabubnagar, Gadwal and Wanaparthy will witness light to moderate rains over the next four days. Hailstorms are also likely to occur in many parts of the state. Overcast conditions have already led to a drop in the maximum temperature in several districts. On Saturday, Hyderabad recorded a maximum temperature of 36.8 degree Celsius. The thunderstorm activity is being attributed to a north-south trough running from the cyclonic circulation over south-west Madhya Pradesh and neighbouring areas to the cyclonic circulation over Comorin and its neighbouring areas across Marathwada, Madhya Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala. Earlier, on April 8, the Telangana State Development Planning Society had recorded light rains of up to 2.2 mm in Sangareddy. In the city, residents were seen enjoying the pleasant weather over the past couple of days. Swathi Bajaj, a resident of Gachibowli, said she hoped the good weather continued. “The heat has been blistering. I hope we get a few spells of showers. That will be a bib break from rising temperatures.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/meteorological-dept-issues-thunderstorm-warning-for-t-dists/articleshow/82009860.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Do not dispossess ryots from Kistapur village: Telangana HC to govt||HYDERABAD: Turning critical towards the revenue officials for not filing counters in a case for the last two years, the Telangana high court has directed the government and revenue officials in Siddipet not to dispossess farmer Nayini Lingam and 35 other farmers from Etigadda Kistapur village of Thoguta mandal in Siddipet district till the next date of hearing. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy was hearing the pleas of the farmers whose land and houses are sought to be acquired for construction of Mallanna Sagar reservoir. This reservoir, being built as part of the mega Kaleshwaram irrigation project, will submerge the village completely. The farmers’ counsel pleaded with the bench to direct the authorities not to dispossess them. “Another set of farmers from our village had approached the court separately and they were already given interim protection from dispossession. The same may be accorded for us too,” the counsel said. Now, the authorities have issued a declaration under section 19 of the Land Acquisition Act because of which farmers are facing the threat of dispossession, he said. The bench said the officials may pass the land acquisition award but they cannot dispossess the farmers nor can they resort to any coercive forms of dispossession. The state counsel said that they issued the declaration in 2019 and said that none of the farmers would be displaced without passing the land acquisition compensation award. “Even after passing the award, do not dispossess the farmers till we hear the matter in June,” the bench said while posting the case to June 21. The bench posted to the same day another petition filed by Gade Srilekha and 50 others from the nearby Vemulghat village. The farmers in this petition also expressed apprehensions about dispossession anytime now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/do-not-dispossess-ryots-from-kistapur-village-hc-to-govt/articleshow/82009888.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Hyderabad||Forest department may resume ops to tranquilise tiger A2||HYDERABAD: The forest department officials might soon resume ‘Operation A2’ to tranquilise the suspected man-eating tiger near Bejjur forest area in the tiger corridor of Komaram Bheem Asifabad district. After having learnt multiple ways to avoid not just the trap cages with baits set up at different locations in the forest, but also outfox the special tracking teams, forest officials said the tiger is finally following its path and they might soon re-launch the operation. “A2 is right now in Asifabad and it made a kill in Bejjur range last Friday. This is the fourth cattle killed in the same location. We are hopeful about resuming the capture operation again since it is following the same path. This we can confirm by the cattle kills that it is making in the same area,” said Komaram Bheema Asifabad district forest officer (DFO), S Shantaram. However, the DFO said that they might have to delay the operation in case forest fires continue to occur in the district. “We have had instances of wild animals move out of the forest due to these fires in the last couple of months. A2 has also changed its path a few times because of these instances. If that happens again, we might have to put the capture operation on hold,” he said. Apart from sending special teams to control the fires as soon as they get a fire alert, the forest officials in Asifabad also set up nearly 200 artificial saucer pits, percolation tanks and solar borewells. The DFO said, “The tiger has to maintain the track at least for a week for us to track movement for tranquilisation.” A2 is the suspected man-eater tiger that mauled two persons to death in Asifabad in November last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/forest-dept-may-resume-ops-to-tranquilise-tiger-a2/articleshow/82009902.cms||Moulika.KV

The man, identified as Om Prakash, is the fifth individual to be killed by a tiger in the forest in six months. Anil Patel, divisional forest officer, buffer, said villagers were warned on Wednesday not to enter the forest as camera traps had captured images of a tigress with cubs in the area. Pugmarks also confirmed the presence of an adult tiger in the vicinity. “Determined to enter, the villagers had tried to overpower our staff on Wednesday. Thereafter, we asked them to give us in writing that they will be entering at their own risk.” DFO Patel said. On Saturday, Om Prakash of Dumera Majhra village, entered the forest and was killed, possibly by the tigress, the DFO said, “The fact that the tiger did not feed upon the body suggests that it is not maneater. The attack took place in the forest, which is the tiger’s territory,” Patel added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/tiger-kills-farmer-in-dtrs-buffer-zone/articleshow/82008678.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Goa||Goa: Docs call out netas for violating protocol, setting a bad example||PANAJI: With Covid cases on the rise and medical facilities stretched to the maximum, healthcare workers have called out politicians for brazenly flouting Covid norms and setting a bad example to the public. “The government is saying gatherings should be banned but they themselves are holding official functions, programmes, launches and inaugurations which can be avoided during this time. They are not leading by example. They speak publicly without masks, cut ribbons without masks and pose without masks. We know the government cannot shut the economy but all unnecessary gatherings should be banned,” a healthcare worker said. During the recently-held civic body elections, many of them were seen violating Covid norms. Days after the maskless Panaji MLA Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate took to the streets of the capital to celebrate his panel’s victory in the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) polls, he tested positive for Covid-19. In the aftermath of his poll victory Monserrate was pictured greeting and hugging his supporters with very few wearing masks and none observing social distancing. Videos of Monserrate, his son and all the corporators celebrating together at a restaurant with no masks also went viral. The Panaji urban health centre is among those reporting the highest active positive cases. “They should be fined just like the general public and shamed for setting a bad example,” the healthcare worker said. At the zilla panchayat bypolls last month, candidate Pratima Coutinho was also seen walking into the polling booth without a mask. She stretched out her hand as the police at the entrance took her temperature with the temperature gun without a word, the booth-level officer identified her name on the electoral roll and she went on to vote in full view of the media. When asked about voting without a mask she said she had developed antibodies (as she had tested positive in the past). The bad examples don’t stop there. Dayanand Sopte’s birthday party at Mandrem recently also had large number of political members and people celebrating, including the chief minister and several BJP functionaries.. “I feel the bureaucracy and leaders who don’t wear masks and follow social distancing are portraying a bad image to the people. Not everyone has the capacity to read intellectual articles. The common man sees what his higher-ups are doing. Healthcare workers in higher posts also need to follow all Covid SOPs and act like leaders,” another healthcare worker said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/docs-call-out-netas-for-violating-protocol-setting-a-bad-example/articleshow/82010166.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Now, hotels and clubs can set up microbreweries||JAIPUR: For the lovers of freshly brewed beer in the city, here is a reason to celebrate. In a bid to encourage light alcoholic beverages, the excise department has framed new rules to install microbreweries in the premises of hotels and clubs. Excise commissioner Joga Ram has issued the notification of the Rajasthan Brewery (Amendments) Rules, 2021. As provisioned in the new Excise Policy 2021-22, for the first time in the history, the excise department will grant licences for the working of microbrewery. The order reads, “Any person having hotel bar/club bar licence issued under the Rajasthan Excise (Grant of hotel bar/club bar licences) Rules 1973 or having restaurant bar licence issued under Rajasthan Excise (Grant of Restaurant Bar licences) Rules, 2004 and desirous of obtaining a licence for microbrewery shall apply to excise commissioner.” The licences will be allowed to manufacture and serve the draught beer in the hotels and clubs as the case may be to serve the same to their customers/members for consumption within the premises. The licensee should arrange to check the quality of raw materials used to produce in the microbrewery by a chemist holding a degree in science with chemistry as one of the subject preferably organic chemistry or bio-chemistry or specialisation in alcohol technology. “The beer shall be released for sale only after the certification of the chemist that it is fit for human consumption on daily basis.” The manufacturers should draw the beer samples at least once in a week and forward the same to the laboratory authorised by the excise commissioner. The rules further read, “The alcohol content of the draught beer supplied to customer should not exceed 8% V/V.” Excise department officials claimed that there is a huge demand for freshly brewed beer because of which the state had brought this policy. Other states including Uttar-Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka have had provisions for microbreweries for some time now and this will encourage both tourism and employment generation in the state. Sources said, “The excise department has fixed the licence fee of Rs 5 lakh to establish the setup. The excise duty imposed will be Rs 60 per litre. The manufactures will be allowed to produce 1,000 litre beer per day.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/now-hotels-and-clubs-can-set-up-microbreweries/articleshow/82009760.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Stock to last for 3 more days only: Telangana vax SOS to Centre||HYDERABAD: Telangana, on Saturday, became the ninth state to report an acute vaccine shortage prompting state chief secretary Somesh Kumar to write to the Centre seeking fresh supplies. This comes exactly two days after Telangana ramped up its Covid vaccination drive, administering over one lakh doses per day. On April 9, 1.15 lakh beneficiaries received jab while the count on April 8 stood at 1.02 lakh, as per government records. “As you are aware, Telangana State is left with only 5.66 lakh doses of vaccine which would last for three days at maximum,” wrote Somesh Kumar in his letter addressed to Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, while underlining the fact that in the coming days the vaccination numbers in Telangana will be “enhanced to over two lakh per day”. “Therefore, I would like to request you to urgently provide at least 30 lakh doses of vaccine to Telangana for the next 15 days,” he added. While initially the vaccination programme in Telangana was sluggish, owing to apprehensions among people about its side-effects, health officials say that the numbers have improved substantially now. “The response from the elderly population (over 60 years of age) that started from March 1 was good, but with those aged 45 years and more being allowed to take the shot from April 1, it has improved further. At this pace, if we have sufficient supply of vaccines, the state can meet its target – of one crore vaccinations -- by the end of July,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director public health, Telangana state. Health officials reiterated that the state has stocks only for another three-four days. Over the last few days, multiple states including Maharashtra, Odisha, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan and Delhi have reported similar shortages, with the governments there urging the Centre to dispatch more doses at the earliest. This, even as the Centre has maintained that vaccines are not in short supply. TOI had reported on Saturday that India’s vaccine production is expected to be limited for a few more weeks with both Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech looking to ramp up production facilities. Serum Institute, with a monthly capacity to produce 60-70 million doses will increase production to nearly 100 million next month. Similarly, Bharat Biotech is looking to more than double production – from current 200,000 doses a day to 500,000 a day by next month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-vax-sos-to-centre-stock-to-last-for-3-more-days-only/articleshow/82010176.cms||Amrita Didyala

Once inaugurated, the flyovers at Jahota, Sitapura and Bambala Puliya will ease vehicular movement. A Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) official said, “The chief minister will inaugurate and lay the foundation stone virtually at 4 pm. Following this, projects will be thrown open for public.” It was informed, the length of the Sitapura RoB is approximately 9.90 metre. Once the traffic is open, it would serve as an alternate route for Mahatama Gandhi Hospital patients, Jagatpura residents and RIICO area commuters. Similarly, residents of many colonies, including Swapna Lok, Kaladera industrial area, Rampura, Dabdi, Jalsu, can use swift passage once Jahota flyover is inaugurated, which is completed after spending Rs 54.60 crore. The Rs 21 crore road widening project of Bambala puliya situated on NH-11 (Jaipur- Tonk) which was constructed recently will also be a big relief for people. The CM will also lay the foundation stone for Rs 70 crore civil lines RoB project and Ramniwas Bagh parking project, proposed to ease congestion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gehlot-to-inaugurate-three-robs-today/articleshow/82009758.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Med, pharma sectors to be given priority in oxygen supply||MUMBAI: The state government has conveyed to the industry department that medical and pharmaceutical sectors will get priority in oxygen supply for the next few weeks. “Last Sunday, nearly 800 metric tonne was being utilised daily for medical purpose in the state. The total production is 1,250 MT a day and by the month-end, all of this will be needed for patients,” said a senior bureaucrat. The government, in its April 4 notification, had stated industries that require oxygen for industrial processes will have to shut by default from April 10 as oxygen will be diverted for medical and pharmaceutical purposes. “We are receiving representations daily from various industries that require oxygen. We are trying to procure it from other states,” said the bureaucrat. The government has appointed the district collector as the special licensing authority to grant licences to those industries that urgently require oxygen. Sandeep Parikh, vice-president, Confederation of Small Scale Industries Association, said they had received a format from the industries commissioner seeking information on oxygen requirements and suppliers. “Vendors procure the cylinders from the oxygen manufacturing units. If the government does not know the intermediaries, how will it ensure the cylinders are provided to those permitted to take them?” he asked. Sandeep Belsare, president, Pimpri-Chinchwad Small Scale Industries Association, said the time limit for seeking special permission to procure oxygen must be extended to April 21. “We had asked for a 100MT/day oxygen plant in Chinchwad but this has so far not materialised.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-med-pharma-sectors-to-be-given-priority-in-oxygen-supply/articleshow/82009778.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Mumbai||Mumbai University plans to offer popular courses in distance, online modes||MUMBAI: Mumbai University’s sought-after self-financed courses such as BMS, BMM or even BAF (B Com accounting and finance) may soon be available in the distance mode. The university’s Institute of Distance and Open Learning (IDOL) is not only planning to start new programmes in the distance mode, but it is also looking at offering these courses online. The plan has been floated at a time when the University Grants Commission (UGC) has started recognising online degrees on account of the pandemic and also to liberalise higher education. Most of the courses currently offered by IDOL are traditional programmes. At the undergraduate level, the institute offers BA, BCom, BSc and B Sc-IT and at postgraduate level MA, M Com, MCA, MSc-IT and MSc-Mathematics. Among the undergraduate courses, BAF and BMS find maximum takers in colleges affiliated to the university with applications received usually over 10 times the number of seats available. With IDOL planning to take these courses to the online mode, students from across the country can benefit, said IDOL director, Prakash Mhanwar. It will also allow students to pursue these courses if they do not make it to the merit list of affiliated colleges, he said. A major overhaul is in the pipeline, with courses shifting from annual to semester-based pattern. At postgraduate level too, IDOL is likely to offer a slew of courses (see box) in collaboration with the university departments once the UGC gives a nod, said Mhanwar. While these specialised programmes will give more students an opportunity to pursue them at a lower cost, there’s a flip side, said a principal. “Classroom teaching and projects are important in these programmes. It will be a challenging proposition for IDOL,” he said, adding these self-financed programmes are also revenue generators for many colleges and their cash flow may take a hit. Apart from the degree courses, IDOL is also planning to offer 8-10 certificate programmes, including a few courses in collaboration with the Bombay Stock Exchange and MU’s department of journalism. For a certificate course in radio jockeying, IDOL is in the process of reviving the university’s campus radio channel, MUST, which had gone off air a few years ago. UGC is currently giving permission to new programmes in distance mode or even in the online format only after universities fulfil all requirements. “IDOL will have to seek approval from the university and the UGC to launch these programmes,” said the director, adding they have already initiated the process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-university-plans-to-offer-popular-courses-in-distance-online-modes/articleshow/82010175.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Ashok Gehlot confident of arresting Covid surge, but complains of vaccine shortage||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot apprised the Congress central leadership on the corona situation in the state while expressing confidence that the state is fully prepared to handle the situation. After the meeting, Gehlot tweeted, “In the meeting told CP (Congress president) Sonia ji that the state is completely prepared to handle the latest surge of Covid & we are fully confident of managing the crisis successfully like we did before. Cases are monitored on a daily basis. Based on this research & analysis, the roadmap is prepared accordingly.” However, the chief minister complained of vaccine shortage. The Congress leadership held the government responsible for the shortage as it exports vaccines at the expense of the people, it alleged. The chief minister said the Prime Minister called for a ‘Tika Utsav’ from April 11-14, but without availability of vaccine how could the vaccination drive be carried out, he asked. He said the Union minister’s statement of sufficient quantities of vaccines are available to the state is against facts. He said till April 6, the Centre had given 1,07,40,860 vaccine doses for people over 60 years of which 2,15,180 doses were given to the armed forces. He said the state got 91,55,370 doses till April 8, and 4,34,888 got wasted which is less than half of the 10% wastage estimated by the Centre. He claimed that daily an average of 5.18 lakh vaccinations were being done in the state. But he said the state was left with only 5 lakh doses of vaccine on Friday night and the next slot of 3.83 lakh doses were expected to arrive on April 12. So he said the government was forced to curtail the target of vaccination from Saturday. Same is the situation in various other states. He said no one should play politics on vaccination, but the central government had to accept the fact that there is real shortage of vaccines instead of blaming the states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gehlot-confident-of-arresting-covid-surge-but-complains-of-vax-shortage/articleshow/82009774.cms||---

On Saturday, the Selaulim reservoir, which provides raw water for treatment and drinking water supply to most of South Goa, recorded water levels of 48%. The Anjunem dam, which helps meet drinking water requirement in Sattari and parts of Bicholim, saw its water level at 39%. Although these levels are sufficient to get the state through the summer, they are marginally lower than what was recorded during the corresponding period in 2020. The water level in Selaulim was around 60% in the second week of April 2020. At Anjunem, the water level stood at 41% during the corresponding period last year. The source of raw water for Bicholim and Bardez, however, are at higher levels. The level in the Tillari reservoir in Dodamarg, Maharashtra, was recorded at 61% on Saturday. Raw water from Tillari is pumped to the Assonora water treatment plant, which serves Bardez and parts of Bicholim. Water levels in the Amthane reservoir in Bicholim stood at 91%. However, supply of treated water to Bardez and Bicholim, despite sufficient raw water availability, is often marred due to other factors like repairs required in the Tillari canals or water supply pipelines coming from Assonora. The Chapoli reservoir, which meets the water requirement of Canacona taluka, is 60% full at present, which is more than sufficient, but lower than last year’s level of over 70% recorded during the corresponding period. Although Goa receives a copious amount of rainfall and despite a good monsoon last year, the state’s topography means lower retention. The capacity of reservoirs in the state to hold water has also reduced over the years, as desilting needs to be taken up. Meanwhile, the water level at the Panchwadi reservoir stood at 39%, lower by close to ten percent from levels recorded during the same period in 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-summer-sizzles-water-levels-at-anjunem-selaulim-under-50/articleshow/82010179.cms||---

The police have seized over 500 sim cards, mostly purchased from other states on false documents with the purpose of calling and texting messages posing as a bank official or from an online wallet company and cheating random people by debiting the money from their debit and credit cards. All arrested accused were from different states except one is a local from Alwar. Three arrested accused were from UP— Pawan Kumar (27), Rachit Verma (21), Sani Sharma (26), Ankit Sharma (27), Manoj Mahapatra (Odisha) and Akhil Kumar (23). The racket comes to light following a complaint filed by one Rakesh Choudhary who had filed a complaint of losing Rs 7.5 lakh from his petrol pump bank account in several transactions taken place between 2 am and 6 am on February 6. He had received OTPs which was not disclosed to anyone followed by a message of the amount debited from his account. “Choudhary’s email id was hacked by the frauds and they were using OTP notified through email. Some bank accounts of business establishments were traced where the money was transferred from Choudhary’s account based in Uttar Pradesh. It turned out that those business establishments had nothing to do with those bank accounts. Further technical details, taken us to mobile shops in Agra and Lakhimpur Khiri. Our first breakthrough was the arrest of a dealer who sold sim cards of fraudulent documents,” said Sardeep Saraswat, deputy SP, Govindgarh Circle. The second breakthrough was an engineer from Alwar, Akhil Kumar who is a web developer and involved in several cyber fraud cases. “Akhil was used as bait to arrest other accused who are related to the particular case. Then, racket however is a very huge spread in several states like Odisha, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh,” said Saraswat. The dealers in UP were selling SIM cards without proper KYC in a price range of Rs 2500-3000 per SIM. Divulging the modus Operandi, Saraswat says that these arrested accused and their counterparts are taking the advantage of a bug in the mobile company app given to the dealers. “By typing the first four numbers you get a list of numbers starting from those numbers. These frauds lift those numbers and checked those which were deactivated. Thereafter they check if the deactivated numbers have Paytm and other online valets attached. The re-activate those numbers while presenting the PAN card similar to the name of the SIM card holder to start taking out money from their bank accounts and online wallets,” said Saraswat. Shankar Dutt Sharma, SP Jaipur Rural told TOI that it is one of the biggest cyber fraud expose which they will uncover layer by layer in the coming days. All these arrests were made in the last few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cyber-fraud-cops-nab-6-seize-over-500-sim-cards/articleshow/82009765.cms||---

Raut and collector Ravindra Thakare also urged hospitals to conduct a ‘fire audit’ of their premises at the earliest through the NMC’s fire department or any other authorized agency. Hospitals, which have more beds and Covid facilities, must also get their electrical equipment checked and upgraded, they added. The spike in Covid cases resulted in an acute shortage of oxygen which had to be tackled on a war-footing with a stock of 90-95 metric tonnes. Apart from stopping of the industrial use of the gas, Thakare also had to arrange additional liquid oxygen from Bhilai in Chhattisgarh. In the review meeting, an oxygen-producing technique through PSA was presented to the district officials, members of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) Nagpur chapter and Dr Anup Marar, convener of Vidarbha Hospitals’ Association (VHA). The WHO-recommended air-separation technology was lauded as a one-time investment to become self-reliant in oxygen generation at the hospitals. Marar said oxygen through PSA was an innovative plan with an one-time investment of up to Rs five crore for 100-bedded hospitals but later there would be no additional refilling costs. “PSA is a futuristic process which can be adopted to stop becoming dependent upon external oxygen sources and suppliers,” he said. In the meeting, Raut also urged private hospitals to maintain transparency in billing apart from seeking help from auditors and the police in case of will-full default and defiance to settle dues. The minister also insisted that hospitals must ensure that billing is done as per the protocol and guidelines issued by the NMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dist-admin-introduces-psa-oxygen-concept-for-hosps-for-self-sufficiency/articleshow/82009442.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Pune||NCDC seeks more samples from state districts with high caseloads||Pune: The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has asked for more Covid-positive samples from the state to determine why there has been a huge surge in cases. The NCDC called for samples mainly from Pune, Mumbai, Nagpur and Thane. Over 1,000 samples were sent earlier, but NCDC director Dr Sujit Singh said the state has to send more details. "We have requested samples from high-incidence districts along with details of the patient, area and time-frame of treatment. Samples of those hospitalised have also been sought," Dr Singh said. He said genomic surveillance of these samples can help determine if there are virus variants in play that can increase transmissibility or disease severity. “We have now demanded samples from clusters in the districts that are seeing surges. We need the details within a specific time-frame to understand whether the surge in cases are because of a particular variant,“ he said. Earlier, 15-20% of the 1,600 samples sent from Maharashtra for sequencing were found with double mutations; another 56 had the UK variant. At the time, Dr Singh had maintained there was no link between the variants and the surge. But he added that more genomic surveillance - using samples sent at the right time from districts with high caseloads - is needed to investigate the link.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ncdc-seeks-more-samples-from-state-districts-with-high-caseloads/articleshow/82010173.cms||Nisha Nambiar

In 2016 while discouraging transactions in cash and urging digital payments, the union government did not realise it was opening new avenues for matka to make payments online. Plenty of matka bookies have now started displaying QR codes boldly on their tables to facilitate payments. Once a customer or gambler places his bets on numbers, he just scans the displayed QR code on his cell-phone to make the payment directly into the account of an agent. Matka gambling is popular business in Goa. The gambling is based on number selection and betting, from 00 to 99. For every rupee, the gambler picks up Rs 90 if a correct bet is made. Matka got its name because numbers were earlier written on pieces of paper and put into a large earthen pot. Cards are now used to select numbers. In Goa, matka bookies can be found everywhere – from nondescript locations and taverns to fish markets. The digital mode of payments for betting, sources say, is convenient for the bookies as the money is directly transferred to his agent’s bank account. If the customer makes a correct bet, he has to visit the bookie the next day to collect his winnings in cash. “There are many advantages,” said one bookie from South Goa. “Everyone uses a smart phone nowadays and the connectivity is good too. It’s convenient for our customers. It helps us too in case of police raids. Police seize the cash in hand, so in case there is trouble, the cash in hand is less. We can minimise our losses during raids.” Raids on matka bookies are few and far between. Even if there are police raids and they are caught, apart from the seizure of cash in hand, there is not much to lose. “Digital payment is the way forward,” said a bookie. QR or Quick Response can be used on various cell-phone device operating systems. A quick response code is a two-dimensional code made up of black and white squares that can be read by smart-phone cameras, point of sale (POS) terminals or other devices. Creation of the QR code is also easy. One just needs an android phone, a bank account, free download of an app called QR code generator and data connection to accept payments. “There two main bazaars (markets) for matka and full numbers are out late evening (around 6pm) and midnight. In the evening, winning payment is not instant like the digital mode. They have to collect the money in cash. The agent has to deliver the money to us to make the payment. This business has never faltered on payment,” said the bookie. The next time police raid a bookie and finds so little cash in his hand, don’t be fooled into believing matka business is dying. It’s in fact booming, thanks to the digital route.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/matka-bookies-go-digital-in-goa-with-qr-codes/articleshow/82010171.cms||Nisser Dias

A slang for the business opportunity of supplying tiffins to home quarantined positive patients, the service has restarted cashflow for micro and small caterers or self-help groups. TOI spoke to a few such tiffin suppliers but none wished to be identified. “We operate from our homes. Someone in the neighbourhood might raise objection over us coming in contact with Covid patients twice a day and end the meagre earning,” said a cook who lives near Jaripatka. These people, who spoke to TOI, used to supply tiffins to college students and even cook midday meals in schools. Now with their core business finished, they branched out to supply meals to home quarantined patients. “Such people have stopped their maids from coming and are too busy in doing all the household chores. Hence, preparing three meals a day becomes too much of a task. So, they opt for lunch and dinner tiffins, with a very small percentage asking for breakfast supply too,” said the cook. Another woman, who used to prepare midday meals as part of a self-help group, said the business has grown in the last two weeks. “As cases rose, orders are coming in steadily. We don’t have money to advertise, so it’s only through word of mouth. Last month, I was preparing six tiffins daily. Today, the number has increased to 24,” she said. A former waiter, who lost his job due to the pandemic, said since March, he as been making a profit of Rs3,000 per week. “The numbers are increasing and I offer them disposable containers too, depending on how much they are ready to pay. Though demand is likely to increase, I don’t think we will be able to cope because my mother cooks and I am the only person who can deliver. So, going beyond 30 customers per day will become a logistical challenge,” said the waiter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-tiffins-a-shot-at-decent-earning-biz-revival/articleshow/82009785.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

At least 1,182 were fined in Bareilly alone, while Rs 1.61 lakh were collected from 489 people in Budaun. Caught unaware, locals were upset with the police drive and the penalty “without a prior warning”. Satish Shukla, a Shahjahanpur resident, told TOI, “If Covid-19 cases are increasing, then the panchayat elections should be postponed. Most of the policemen themselves don’t wear masks or follow the guidelines. Instead of issuing fines, police should have given a warning for a day.” Locals in Bareilly, meanwhile, rued police action, criticising that police didn’t take action against people gathered in large numbers at a school ground while protesting against Waseem Rizvi and Narsinghanand Saraswati. Bareilly SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan told TOI, “Wearing masks at public places is mandatory, but most of the people are not following the guidelines. Wearing masks and maintaining social distancing will save them from getting infected.” “We are aware that hundreds of people gathered together for a protest on Friday in Bareilly. We are checking CCTV footages to identify people defying the guidelines and action would be taken against them, soon,” added the SSP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/in-a-massive-police-crackdown-2100-people-fined-rs-4-74-lakh-in-a-day-for-not-wearing-mask-in-ups-bareilly-division/articleshow/82008707.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Delhi||Covid-19 positivity rate enters double digits in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Delhi recorded 7,897 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, while 39 more people died due to the infection, taking the death toll to 11,235. The positivity rate was recorded at 10.21%, going over 10% for the first time this year. It shows how widespread the infection has become, doctors said. With over seven lakh Covid cases, Delhi is the sixth most affected among states and UTs in the country. Maharashtra tops the list with over 32 lakh cases, followed by Kerala (11.6 lakh), Karnataka (10.6 lakh), Andhra Pradesh (9.2 lakh) and Tamil Nadu (9.3 lakh) In terms of fatalities reported, Delhi stands fourth in the country with 11,235 deaths. Maharashtra has reported over 57,000 deaths, followed by Tamil Nadu (12,886) and Karnataka (12,849). Till March second week, the positivity rate of Covid-19 tests in the capital was less than 1%. However, it started increasing exponentially from March 22. On March 23, the daily tally crossed the 1,000 mark. On April 1, the city reported 2,790 cases. Since then, the tally has been increasing by nearly a thousand daily. On Friday, the number of cases in a day was recorded at 8,521, second highest till date, with more than 1 lakh samples being tested. Saturday’s drop in number of cases could be a result of reduced tests. According to the state health bulletin released by the Delhi government, a total of 77,374 tests, including 43,473 RT-PCR tests and 33,901 rapid antigen tests, were conducted a day ago, of which 10.21% came positive. The number of active cases rose to 28,773 from 26,631. The number of people under home isolation increased to 15,266 from 13,188 on Friday, while the number of containment zones went up to 5,236 from 4,768 a day before, the health bulletin said. Health minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday had warned that the number of new cases “could cross” the last single-day spike record registered in November, given the pace of the spread ofthe infection. During the surge in Covid cases, swiftness of the process is a must. In view of the same, in addition to CDMOs, all medical superintendents and directors of Delhi government hospitals dedicated for Covid are now authorised to issue oxygen concentrators to discharged patients, Jain tweeted. The health minister also shared a copy of the government order issued to all state-run hospitals stating that the tenure of presently working senior resident and junior residents will be extended for six months. In addition, candidates will be hired for vacant posts, he added. The Delhi government has also directed its hospitals to engage fourth- and fifth-year MBBS students, interns and BDS doctors to meet the increased demand for manpower. “We hope to fight this surge soon,” Jain added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/positivity-rate-enters-double-digits/articleshow/82009769.cms||---

The snake got its name from curved teeth shaped weapon (kukri). Snake rescuer Sharad Dabhade said a person, Chand Shaha, from Brijwadi area called him on Thursday night when he spotted the snake inside his chicken coop. “No sooner did we receive the call, a rescue team comprising Anand Jadhav, Bapu Mudgal and I reached the location. The nocturnal specie of snake, banded kukri snake are less agile as compared to other snakes. With minimum effort the snake was taken out of chicken coop,” he said. The rescued snake, measured over 2.5 feet, is a female “A large banded kukri snakes are spotted occasionally, not very common. The rescued snake will be released into the natural habitat with the help of the forest department officials soon,” Dabhade said. The snakes are non-venomous. “While public at large have little knowledge about snakes with all such reptiles considered venomous, banded kukri is often misconstrued as venomous common karit snake and hence are killed. Like every other snake, banded kukri snake has an important role in the food-chain of the nature and should be protected,” Dabhade said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/banded-kukri-snake-rescued/articleshow/82031805.cms||---

They are deploying one vehicle with two staff members in each zone to collect waste from the identified houses every third day. Residents, however, are not happy with the speed of the work. They claim that the civic bodies are taking at least 4-5 days to act on a complaint.A senior North Delhi Municipal Corporation official said that the staff engaged in collection of hazardous waste were taking all precautions, including lifting of garbage in covered vehicles. “We act as soon as we get information from the district office on a daily basis. Our staff visit the house after three-four days and hand over the hazardous waste to two agencies appointed by Delhi government for handling such waste. However, it is the responsibility of the households to keep the waste of infected patients separately,” the official added.“We have been doing our work diligently but if anyone, including RWAs, have any issue, they can call at our zonal offices’ numbers to get timely help,” said a civic official.Chitra Jain, a resident of New Friends Colony, said that in their colony, information about infected people was being made available very late. Even the civic body concerned was not making efforts to collect the hazardous waste separately, probably because it had no information about the infected persons, she added. “Such delays will automatically risk the life of the waste collectors, who collect waste from other households and mix them with the rest of the garbage collected from the neighbourhood,” Jain said.Sanjay Rana, president of GK-II RWA, said that many times, they themselves have asked the department concerned to act diligently after getting information about infected persons in the colony. “We are arranging for regular vaccination of senior citizens, and for ambulances to help those who can’t commute on their own. But we need support from all departments,” Rana added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-hazardous-waste-piles-up-residents-seek-quicker-action/articleshow/82009789.cms||Vibha Sharma

The state reported an all-time high Covid-19 tests on Saturday when 56,020 samples were tested for Covid-19. The health department’s teams are collecting samples from railway stations, bus stops, airports and from the areas where the Covid-19 cases have been detected. Testing is an effective way of surveillance for Covid-19 as it helps in identifying areas where clusters of infections are prevalent. “We have increased the number of RT-PCR test done daily. On Friday too, we had collected nearly 55,000 samples for Covid-19 test,” said Siddharth Mahajan, secretary (health). The average tests done daily in April has more than doubled than the average number of tests done daily in March. In April, the state government has done an average of 43,266 testing daily, while in March it was 19,497. In February, it was just 16,169 average number of daily testing as the daily Covid-19 cases were fewer than in March and April. When the first wave of Covid-19 was at its peak in November, the average number of daily testing was 22,620 and in December it increased to 27,539 when the first wave continued to take toll on the health of the people. According to the health department officials, for preventing spread of the second wave, the health department is focusing more on conducting test as part of its intensifying surveillance measures. Currently the state has capacity of testing 70,000 samples daily and soon we will be able to test 1 lakh sample daily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-ramps-up-testing-hits-single-day-record-of-56k/articleshow/82009787.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Schools being approached for Covid-19 care centres||NAGPUR: Some schools are being approached by local politicians to hand over their campus for Covid Care Centre (CCC) facilities, something which academics say is impossible considering that board exams are scheduled to start in two weeks. Not wishing to be identified, a group of state board school principals told TOI that they have been separately approached by politicians. “I was called by a leader on Thursday who said that since schools are closed for physical classes, he wants to use it for a CCC. I told him that though schools are closed for students, everyday our staff is on campus to carry out academic work,” said the principal. Another principal, whose family is also the school’s trustee, said, “Our staff comes to school not only for online teaching work, but also for clerical duties. Board exams are starting soon and there is lot of paperwork to be done.” This year, the Maharashtra government has modified its rules for the board exams to accommodate challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Now every school is an exam centre because students will appear in their alma mater only rather than an external centre. So our workload has that way increased and a lot of coordination needs to be done,” said another principal. “We told the politicians that board exams are starting from April 23 and so, there is no way schools can be handed over to function as CCCs. In fact we advised them to take control of engineering colleges which are not functioning at all in physical mode. Their exams too are happening online,” said the principal. As the number of cases rise, political party workers and leaders are also gearing up to rope in social and private infrastructure for assistance. “But rather than schools, they must look for hostels. In our schools there’s just one common washroom, so using it as a CCC facility will be a bad idea,” said a principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/schools-being-approached-for-covid-19-care-centres/articleshow/82009466.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Goa||Policy moots 30% sops to buy e-bikes||Panaji: Buying electric two-wheelers would be nearly 30% cheaper in Goa compared to buying two-wheelers running on petrol, as the draft Goa Electric Vehicle Promotion Policy has proposed huge subsidies for promoting eco-friendly electric two-wheelers. Two-wheelers constitute more than 50% of the total vehicles bought every year in the state. A senior officer said that there are over eight lakh two-wheelers registered in the state. The officer said that the policy would be finalised within the next two months. He also said that the policy, which was drafted earlier, did not have this new proposal of providing subsidies. “The modified policy would be placed before the cabinet for approval,” he said. The objective of the policy is to encourage startups and investments in the field of electric mobility and associated sectors such as mobility as a service (MaaS), autonomous vehicles, data analytics and information technology, to promote service units which would include electric vehicles (EV) and battery repair and maintenance stations and to promote R&D, innovation and skill development within the EV sector. The government plans to have charging stations every 25km on highways and every 3km within city limits. Battery swapping and fast charges are also included in the ambit of this policy. All EV charging stations, both private and public, will adhere to the protocol approved by the Centre, as updated on October 1, 2019, that is Bharat EV charger AC-001 and Bharat EV charger DC-001, and any other protocols as and when notified. In keeping with the government’s green initiative, solar-powered stations will be given priority and encouraged in the case of both private and public charging stations. “Adoption of EVs for daily commute is essential for a wide range of goals, including better air quality, reduced noise pollution, enhanced energy security along with lowered carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions. With vehicular pollution being a persistent source of reduced air quality within the state, rapid adoption of zero emission vehicles is of great importance,” the policy states. If the state approves the policy, it will be applicable for four years, following the notification after which it may be revised or extended. The policy will be applicable to all classes of EV, including two-wheelers, three-wheelers, passenger cars and commercial light/heavy vehicles that are operated in the state with a Goa-based RTO registration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/policy-moots-30-sops-to-buy-e-bikes/articleshow/82010188.cms||Murari Shetye

---||Pune||16 more Covid care centres soon in PMC limits||Pune: The civic body has decided to start 16 more Covid care centres in various parts of Pune for institutional isolation of patients with mild symptoms. The capacity of these centres would be around 6,000. The commencement of these Covid care centres (CCCs) would help reduce overburdening in hospitals treating serious patients, said officials. The administration has already appointed medical staff and doctors at five CCCs and initiated steps to appoint similar number of staffers at the remaining 11CCCs. About 9 CCCs are already in operation. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) said patients can walk-in at these facilities with a Covid-19 positive report to get admitted. The centres will also have oxygen facilities as a precautionary measure. An official from the administration said, “The CCCs were operational even during the earlier outbreak and played a vital role in institutional isolation of asymptomatic patients. We have been putting efforts since last month to create more institutional facilities as the number of patients with mild symptoms is on the rise. Not all patients have isolation facilities at home. Such patients can prefer staying at these centres. If asymptomatic patients avoid going to the hospitals for stay, the beds there can be made available for serious patients.” The civic administration is in the process of completing the required formalities to commence the CCCs. It has identified hostels, buildings of educational institutes to set up the CCCs. Rajendra Muthe, deputy commissioner, PMC, said, “We are already operating 9CCCs.

---||Nagpur||Remdesivir allotment and availability data now on collector’s website||Nagpur: The district administration is now trying to ensure that updates on allotment and availability of Remdesivir injections in Covid hospitals and such facilities are made available on its website nagpur.gov.in. The move is aimed at keeping citizens updated in the backdrop of massive shortage and spiralling demands for the drug in the city, leading to other issues like rumour-mongering and black marketing. As per the website data on the first day, city Covid hospitals were allotted 2,769 Remdesivir injections, while rural ones were provided 933 doses. During a review meeting under energy and guardian minister Nitin Raut on Saturday, the issue of Remdesivir and bed shortage were discussed on priority. The guardian minister asked the district administration and police machineries to come down heavily on any instances of black marketing and overpricing. Raut also asked the district and city civic administration to work in close coordination to address the shortage of beds and Remdesivir injections in both the rural and urban set-ups. District collector Ravindra Thakare issued an order on Friday allowing the distributors and stockists of Remdesivir injections to sell the crucial drug, adding that priority should be given to Covid hospitals and their attached pharmacies before selling them to others, including citizens with prescriptions. In an earlier order on April 6, Thakare had asked the pharmaceutical companies to supply Remdesivir directly to the Covid hospitals and their pharmacies. Reversing his order within four days, Thakare has now changed his strategy with the view that the high demand of the injections cannot be met without the involvement of the pharmacists and chemists. Sources said substantial stocks of the pharmacists and chemists too had got stuck with the previous order. According to Hetal Thakkar, secretary of the Nagpur district Chemists and Druggists Association, the latest order of the collector would help them channelise the Remdesivir injections in proper manner to the needy patients. “We are finalizing some names of retailers before submitting them to the collector for allowing them too,” he said. As per an unconfirmed source, it’s learnt that around 10,000 vials of doses from a pharmaceutical company arrived in the city following the intervention of Union minister Nitin Gadkari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/remdesivir-allotment-and-availability-data-now-on-collectors-website/articleshow/82009805.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Mumbai||Centre will send 1,121 ventilators to Maharashtra, help with oxygen: Prakash Javadekar||PUNE: Union minister Prakash Javadekar on Saturday said that the Centre would be sending 1,121 ventilators to the state. “The ventilators would be distributed to the state in the next three days. A total of 700 ventilators would come from Gujarat and the remaining 421 from Andhra Pradesh,” Javdekar said after attending the weekly Covid-19 review meeting of the district at the Council Hall that was convened by deputy chief minister and Pune guardian minister Ajit Pawar. Javdekar said the Centre would help the state in procuring medical oxygen from various industrial units across the country. He said all efforts would be made to ensure the state would not lack for oxygen for Covid-19 patients. He said funds would be allocated under the National Health Mission (NHM) to fill up vacant posts of officials for carrying out testing and tracing in the state. The minister said that a team under IAS officer Kunal Kumar was preparing a report based on the observations of the various central delegations that visited 30 districts in the state. He said the report would be implemented in the state. Amid reports of acute shortage of vaccine doses in the state, Javdekar said that Maharashtra was next to Gujarat and Rajasthan in terms of allocation of vaccine doses by the Centre. “According to the Friday’s report prepared by the Centre, the state has been allocated 1.1 crore doses so far,” Javadekar said. “Of these, 95 lakh doses have been utilised till date. The remaining 15.63 lakh doses at various transit points should be distributed immediately.” The Union minister said he had spoken to the chief secretary, Sitaram Kunte, on the issue. Javadekar said that he did not want to get involved in any blame game regarding vaccine doses. He said the focus right now was on dealing with the current situation. “When we shall have to do politics, we shall give proper answers to the allegations. There is nothing greater than the interest of the people in the current situation,” the minister said.  Pawar said that in the current situation, the Centre should give the assured doses to the state without politicising the issue. He said that the doses Javadekar mentioned must be at different transit points and would be distributed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/centre-will-send-1121-ventilators-to-maharashtra-state-help-with-oxygen-javadekar/articleshow/82010560.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Hyderabad||Now, AP IAS, IPS officers on CM watch||Vijayawada: In a major move that would put the career prospects of IAS and IPS officers directly under the control of a politician, the AP government on Saturday issued orders changing the service rules of the All-India Service Officers. With this, the chief minister now has the authority to accept annual performance appraisal reports. So far, the chief secretary was the accepting authority for appraisal reports of IAS and IPS officers. This is perhaps the first time in the country that a state government has come out with orders granting the power of “accepting authority” to the chief minister. Under the new orders, the chief secretary is the “reviewing authority” of annual appraisal reports of All-India Service Officers, while the heads of department are the “reporting authority”. The final decision whether or not to accept the appraisal reports rests with the chief minister. Sources, however, said the validity of these orders is doubtful and the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) in the central government, which controls All India Service officers, may not accept this if anyone challenges the orders. In the orders (GO RT No 726 dated April 10), the state government said that the changes have been made to “ensure uniformity and control of the executive over the administration for effective public service delivery.” The GO further said the “government hereby prescribes the reporting, reviewing and accepting authorities for writing of performance appraisal reports of all the All India Service Officers of AP cadre”. It then described which cadre official should report to whom. In all these cases the accepting authority, however, is the chief minister. As per the GO, heads of departments and the chief secretary will review the performance reports while the chief minister will have the accepting power. However, the secretary to the governor is exempted from the reporting and reviewing authority. The appraisal of the secretary to the governor will be accepted by the governor. District collectors are now put under the chief commissioner of land administration (CCLA), while the others, including heads of department are kept under the control of the respective department secretary. Former bureaucrats, however, are divided over whether the GO would stand to legal scrutiny. Some fear that the administration will weaken from inside as IAS and IPS officials may not honour the hierarchy as their appraisal would be cleared by the chief minister himself. K Prabhakar Reddy, former IAS officer, who served in the CMO, told TOI that to his knowledge, no chief minister in the country has made such provisions. “AP is the first or perhaps only state where the All India Service officers are kept under the chief minister as accepting authority,” he said. Mohd Shafiquzzaman, a former special chief secretary, said the chief minister has always been part of the exercise. Mostly in respect of senior IAS officers. But the previous chief ministers used to depend on the feedback of their secretaries and sign the reports. “There is a note of caution here”, Shafiquzzaman said adding that if the chief minister wants to be the final authority, it would mean that the importance of middle-level reporting officers will disappear. “Now, junior officers will not care for their immediate reporting officers. The chief minister may gain a stranglehold over the bureaucracy, but that will weaken the administrative mechanism from inside,” he said. However, BR Meena, former president of Telangana IAS officers’ association, said that there was nothing unusual in the orders as the chief ministers were anyway accepting authorities in the past as well. “If a chief minister wants to take over this task then he has to follow all the rules related to annual performance reports. This includes notifying affected officers in advance if the accepting authority decides to give or change the grade to an officer,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/now-ap-ias-ips-officers-on-cm-watch/articleshow/82010196.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Delhi||Shaheen Bagh teacher abducted by his former student over Rs 20 lakh||NEW DELHI: Four days after a maulana had been abducted from southeast Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh for a Rs 25-lakh ransom, Delhi Police’s Crime Branch has rescued him and arrested five kidnappers. Sadaqat (23), the mastermind, was a former student of the maulana, said DCP (crime) Bhisham Singh. The victim, associated with a madrassa in Shaheen Bagh, allegedly had Sadaqat’s Rs 20 lakh with him but was not returning it, prompting the accused to hatch the plot, police said. The cops were informed about the abduction on April 6 when a man reported that his brother, Maulana Mohammad Muntazir Alam, a resident of Shaheen Bagh, had been missing since April 5. An FIR was registered and the investigation taken up. The victim’s family subsequently received a ransom call from his number and was asked to pay Rs 25 lakh. “The incident had created panic in the family of the victim and in the society. Hence, several teams were formed to solve the case and rescue the victim,” DCP Singh said. The teams developed intelligence about possible suspects and mounted technical surveillance. Footage from CCTV cameras were collected and analysed, and the victim was visible in one of them accompanied by a youth, later identified as Sadaqat. Sadaqat’s mobile phone was found switched off, but sub-inspector Arun Sindhu and his team used technical help and arrested him following a raid at Harol in Noida. On the basis of his information, the cops reached N Block, Abul Fazal Enclave in Shaheen Bagh. There was high drama when police went to conduct a raid at N Block. They broke open the doors of a flat and found the victim shackled with iron chains. The other accused, all in their early 20s, were also arrested. They have been identified as Shamim, Nabi Hasan, Firdaus and Manzar Alam. During interrogation, Sadaqat disclosed that he was a student of the maulana in 2008. Sadaqat was running a food stall in Okhla and used to deposit his savings with Alam for five years. He had kept Rs 20 lakh with the maulana that he had earned from the stall and by betting on cricket matches. But when Sadaqat asked Alam to return the money, he refused to return it. This prompted Sadaqat to hatch the plot to teach Alam a lesson and get his money back. As per the plan, Sadaqa had rented a house in Shaheen Bagh with his associates and contacted the maulana to visit the house and perform rituals there. But when Alam came to the house, he was chained and kept in a room.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ex-student-abducts-teacher-over-rs-20l/articleshow/82009798.cms||---

ED officials said Rs 3 crore of unaccounted cash, Rs 1crore worth jewellery, blank cheques, property documents, lockers etc were seized during the day-long raids. A few of the suspects were reportedly shifted to the ED office for further questioning. Till last reports came in, ED officials were continuing their searches at various places in the city. Apart from Srinivas Reddy and Mukunda Reddy, ED personnel conducted searches at the residence of former IMS director Dr Devika Rani, the prime accused in IMS fraud, which is being probed by ACB, her husband P Gurumurthy, Srihari Babu of Omni Medi group, M Vinay Reddy, brother-in-law of Mukunda Reddy, B Pramod Reddy and premises of Omni Medi. “During the course of searches, unaccounted cash of Rs 1.50 crore, Rs 1.15 crore, Rs 45 lakh was seized from the residential premises of V Srinivas Reddy, Burra Pramod Reddy and M. Vinay Reddy respectively,’’ ED officials said. Former IMS chief Devika Rani had allowed shell companies to supply indents of medicines at higher prices to ESI hospitals by creating false records. ED initiated money laundering investigation against Devika Rani, her husband and several others on the basis of eight first information reports (FIRs) registered by ACB on the allegations of financial irregularities committed by the accused during the purchase and supply of medicines, surgical kits and others. They were also accused of inflating the cost in violation of ESIC norms, creation of fake indents, fake bills and falsification of records. “The scam has generated proceeds of crime (POC) approximately between Rs 100 crore and Rs 200 crore,” ED officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ims-fraud-ed-raids-nayanis-kin-pa-seize-rs-3cr-cash-jewellery/articleshow/82009790.cms||---

The UT forest and wildlife department was to carry out the second census in April 2020, but the same was postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Consequent to the outbreak, a lockdown was imposed and the ideal season to perform a census elapsed. UT’s chief conservator of forests (CCF) Debendra Dalai said the department has again written a letter to the Dehradun-based institute for providing expertise in carrying out the wildlife census in the sanctuary. He said officials of the institute had agreed to provide technical support to the department for carrying out the census, but they were yet to receive official confirmation. He said March and April are the best time to carry out the wildlife census. The first wildlife census was carried out at the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary in 2010. Being a season specific, the second wildlife census could not be carried out in 2020 as the best period to spot the animals had passed due to the lockdown, said Dalai, adding that it was difficult to locate animals in other seasons. A team of experts from the WII, environmentalists, and representatives of NGOs and biology and zoology students of Panjab University took part in the first census. The team took three days to count nine species of mammals and 65 species of birds by using direct evidence, including animals and birds spotted in the area, and indirect evidence like foot-prints and animal faeces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-reminds-doon-institute-to-conduct-2nd-wildlife-census/articleshow/82009469.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||India||‘Shots limited, easing eligibility criteria now will be dangerous’||NEW DELHI: India is operating amid a raging pandemic with finite supplies of vaccines and the primary role of vaccination is to reduce deaths and hospitalisation and opening the shots for the general population will be a gamble with lives, says Dr N K Arora, member of the National Committee on Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI). Current estimates show that till July-August, there will be just sufficient vaccines for the 40-crore people above the age of 45 years in the country, accounting for about a third of the population. “This means, every jab that goes to a younger adult will be at the expense of an older adult who is at a higher risk of severe disease and death. With finite resources, focusing on the goal to save lives and reduce hospitalisations is absolutely essential. Mixing up goals of vaccination at this time could mean gambling with lives... we cannot afford infinite experimentation, and definitely not infinite errors,” Dr Arora, who also heads Operations Research Group at the Indian Council of Medical Research, said. “If we immunise younger adults at present, our main goal becomes to relieve that age group of symptomatic infection, which is what the current vaccines are known to be doing. But a large share of the population in that age group is fortunately, already asymptomatic or shows mild symptoms when infected,” he said. Arora countered the argument that youths being mobile could significantly spread infection. “Prioritising them for vaccination based on that assumption will be giving into another gamble — mainly because vaccines are not yet known to interrupt chain of transmission,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/shots-limited-easing-eligibility-criteria-now-will-be-dangerous/articleshow/82011121.cms||---

---||Delhi||‘CBSE to decide about boards, coaching centres to go online’||NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia clarified on Saturday that even colleges and coaching centres would have to shift classes online in the wake of the ongoing Covid-19 surge. On the board examinations, which are to begin next month, the education minister left the decision to Central Board of Secondary Education. On Friday, Delhi government announced suspension of the offline activities in all city schools. It had earlier allowed the students of classes IX to XII to come to school. The annual and pre-board examinations were going on for these classes at the government schools, while CBSE’s practical exams for Class XII students were being held at all schools. During live chats with students and teachers, Sisodia, who is also the education minister, said, “CBSE is conducting the practicals, so they will have to take a decision. However, we have advised the schools to consult the examiners. For a few students, the practicals still remain. Schools should keep it after the 20th of the month. We will then review the situation.” The decision of calling teachers to school has been left to the institutions, the minister said. “It is not necessary for teachers to be present in school. The principal and the staff should together decide if all of them need to come or it can be done in rotation. There is no order from our side.” Sisodia also said, “There is a scare of Covid spreading from educational institutions. If 40-50 students are in one class, a library, there is a risk. So the colleges will also remain closed.” Delhi government school students of classes IX and XI will be informed about their new exam dates. “If you all come to give exams and get infected with Covid, it will not be good for any of us,” Sisodia said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cbse-to-decide-about-boards-coaching-centres-to-go-online/articleshow/82009806.cms||---

With no space left for morning walkers, foul smell also emanated from the accumulated water in the park. The entrance of the park was submerged and water flowed to the road as well. Karanvir Singh, a local resident, said, “When I came for my morning run, one side of the park was submerged. Foul smell too emanated from the dirty water.” Not only the morning walkers were affected, but people living in the nearby houses too complained of foul smell in the area. “Despite living closer to the green belt, we still have to face such a condition. The authorities concerned should make sure that such incident never takes place again,” stated a woman requesting anonymity. When gathered, residents alleged that it is not the first time that water has accumulated as it is a common sight in this park as well as in the park in front of it, which is situated on the opposite side of the road at Sector 44D. “We have submitted complaints at the municipal corporation office multiple times regarding the matter, but nothing has been done to solve the issue,” said Sudarshan Joshi, president of the resident welfare association of Sector 44. Local residents said the authorities must come up with a permanent solution for this issue. Chief engineer Shailender Singh said, “There was a leakage from the tertiary water supply. We have stopped the water connection for now and the repair work will start on Sunday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/water-pipe-bursts-sec-44-park-flooded/articleshow/82009474.cms||---

The managements must also take up proactive measures to educate, alert and help their customers to travel safely back home by arranging alternative transportation facilities,” Cyberabad police said in a press note. All establishments must display educational messages prominently in their premises and play audio and video messages frequently to alert their customers, the police told the owners. The managements were asked to contact Dial-100 in case a customer creates nuisance for stopping him/her from driving in an inebriated state. They were also directed to ensure that masks are worn by all in the premises of their establishments. “It is hereby reiterated that wearing of masks in all public places, workspaces and public means of transport shall be mandatory across the state under the Disaster Management Act, 2005.

---||Hyderabad||Bagan make Indian football history, pay Rs 1 crore for Hyderabad player||PANAJI: ATK Mohun Bagan have agreed to pay the highest ever transfer fee for a domestic player in Indian football history to Hyderabad FC to get the young winger Liston Colaco. The talented 22-year-old will be acquired for around Rs 1 crore, a little more than the Rs 90 lakh ATK paid to fulfil Michael Soosairaj’s buy-out clause and get him released from Jamshedpur FC in 2019. Calaco had a year left on his existing contract with Hyderabad. Immediately after conclusion of the Indian Super League, ATK Mohun Bagan chased Colaco relentlessly, but Hyderabad stood firm. Two big offers were first rejected. The club decided to release the youngster only when they were assured of a record transfer fee. “With a focus on long-term sustainability, Hyderabad FC agreed for Liston’s move in a deal that fetches the highest-ever transfer fee received for an Indian player,” the club said on Saturday. While Colaco plays many positions upfront, his preferred role is on the left wing from where he loves cutting in. It’s the same position Soosairaj is most comfortable and both are now left to possibly fight for that spot. Should Colaco move to the right, he’ll have to compete with Manvir Singh, one of the club’s success stories this season. Ever since his days with Salgaocar FC in the Goa Professional League, where he finished as the top scorer at 19, Colaco has been billed as the best young player in recent times. FC Goa spent Rs 10 lakh as transfer fee in 2017 to sign Colaco from Salgaocar, but the youngster did not get enough playing time. Before the end of his three-year contract, he was then allowed to join Hyderabad on a free transfer during the January window. Colaco got a few games during the club’s debut season (2019-20) in ISL when they finished last. It was only under Manuel Marquez that he showed his true potential at Hyderabad this year with two goals and three assists. His best show was against East Bengal at the Tilak Maidan in Vasco. The most noteworthy moment was when he sent East Bengal’s experienced full back Scott Neville the wrong way, before releasing a diagonal ball for Halicharan Narzary to score. The winger made his international debut last month against the United Arab Emirates (UAE) at the Zabeel Stadium in Dubai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bagan-make-indian-football-history-pay-rs-1cr-for-hyd-player/articleshow/82010200.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Delhi||Delhi: A peek into how new Rajpath buildings will look||NEW DELHI: The new office buildings that will come up and replace the existing ones along the Rajpath will get an identical and swanky look. The tenders for the first three such buildings with more facilities will be out next week as the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has received the go ahead from the Delhi Urban Art Commission (DUAC) and the Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC), sources said. The three buildings, which will be built on the plot where IGNCA is currently located, would involve an expenditure of around Rs 3,200 crore, TOI has learnt. These buildings will have big entry and exit gates, and the porches will be long and spacious to accommodate over a dozen cars at one time. The government has not yet finalised the names for these future buildings which will fall under Common Central Secretariat (CCS), though sources said each building would get a name. “Proper study has been carried out to assess how many people and vehicles enter and leave the existing office complexes daily. The entry and exit points in the future buildings have been planned to meet those requirements,” said a source. He added that estimates suggest the number of people commuting by Metro to reach these office buildings may increase to 50% compared with 40% currently. Therefore, a robust underground transit facility for office goers has been planned, which will link the buildings that will come up along the Rajpath. “There will be adequate security arrangements to check the identity of office goers and for frisking before they enter the buildings from the basements,” said a source. The office space will be created to meet more modern and IT requirements and there will be a uniform norm while creating the workstations. For example, all rooms of joint secretaries will be of one standard unlike the current norms, said a source. “The focus of creating such office space is to help increase the efficiency of workers by provisioning the required facilities,” said another official. TOI on January 1 had reported how these buildings in the Common Central Secretariat will have space for yoga, gymnasium, creche, pharmacy and first-aid centre. The government has also prepared a roadmap for improving the geometrics of all roundabouts and roads leading to the Rajpath and the office buildings to meet the future traffic demand. Currently, 30 ministries are housed on the Central Vista, while around 27 ministries have offices outside the Vista. The plan is to bring all the 50 plus ministries at one location.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-peek-into-how-new-rajpath-bldgs-will-look/articleshow/82010211.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Delhi||BJP protests outside Delhi CM’s house for ‘bonus’ to farmers||NEW DELHI: Leader of the Opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Bidhuri and other BJP MLAs protested outside chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence on Saturday and called the AAP government anti-farmer. They demanded that the government should fulfill its promise of paying 50% bonus over and above the minimum support price in Delhi. AAP and BJP have locked horns over wheat procurement with AAP claiming that it has not been started by FCI yet and BJP denying the claim. The BJP functionaries, who were accompanied by some farmers and members of BJP farmers’ cell, claimed that “the agriculture department of the AAP government has failed to issue certificates to the farmers due to which they are selling wheat at far lower prices than the MSP.” “Due to lack of documents, farmers are being forced to sell their produce at Rs 1,600 per quintal, which was below the MSP,” Bidhuri said. “CM had claimed that his government implemented the Swaminathan Commission recommendations in Delhi and the farmers were being provided 50% bonus over and above the MSP. At present, the MSP declared by the central government is Rs 1,975 per quintal and the 50% bonus comes to Rs 987.5 per quintal. This should be paid to the farmers immediately,” Bidhuri said. The BJP functionaries could not meet the CM but submitted a memorandum addressed to him. The memorandum stated that FCI had started the procurement of wheat at Rs 1,975 per quintal in Delhi from April 6. Till now, around 158 quintals of wheat have been procured by FCI for which the farmers were paid the MSP. “This procurement was done based on the verified documents of the farmers. However, from April 7, the agriculture department stopped issuing certificates to the farmers so FCI could not make any further procurement, which was unfortunate,” Bidhuri said. MLA Vijendra Gupta demanded the CM immediately issue strict instructions to the agriculture department to commence the verification of documents of the farmers. No reaction was available from Delhi government on the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-protests-outside-cms-house-for-bonus-to-farmers/articleshow/82009822.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Three arrested in Bengaluru for online investment fraud||HYDERABAD: A manager of a prominent bank and two others have been arrested at Bengaluru for allegedly cheating a city woman. The three are said to have been working for a Hong Kong-based person, who had set up businesses, collected money from gullible individuals through app-based financial plans and later duped them. One of the arrested persons along with the Hong Kong resident were associated with an instant online loan platform in the past. The accused — Ashok Kumar, K Sanjeev Kumar, and Asim Akhtar — were arrested by Rachakonda police’s cyber crime wing after the woman lodged a complaint stating that she had been duped through the investment app. The complainant said that she had invested Rs 20 lakh and had been promised a return of over Rs 54 lakh. “In March, the victim had received a WhatsApp message from a Hong Kong-based number, explaining about an investment and online trading app which will help her get huge profits on a daily basis. They made her download an app by sending a link,’’ Rachakonda police said. Later, on the pretext of recharge through the app, the accused collected Rs 500 and made her a member of Strategy Team group on WhatsApp. The group admins’ mobile phones were found to be Hong Kong-based. Initially, she spent Rs 50,000 by showing interest in trading business. “The accused provoked and lured the victim to invest more money to earn huge returns. With a hope to get higher returns, the victim invested Rs 20 lakh by making several transactions through the app which, over a period of time, showed she had a total balance of Rs 54.39 lakh,’’ police said. When she attempted to withdraw the money, the woman realised that she had been duped. During investigation, police found out that of the different bank accounts into which the money had been transferred, one account was Bengaluru-based. A police team reached the city and arrested three. During investigation, police came to know that Ashok had joined an instant online loan company, run by one Scott Wang of Hong Kong. Wang had made Ashok in charge of his local office. They then recruited employees to recover loans from borrowers. The arrested had joined Wang as freelancers, helping him get newly-acquired companies registered with the Registrar of Companies (RoC) and other agencies besides setting up bank accounts. The accused allegedly opened 15 fake companies, banking of credentials of which were shared with Wang, who in turn would receive the money invested by victims of the scam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/three-arrested-in-bluru-for-online-investment-fraud/articleshow/82009830.cms||---

All India Hotel Management Association, an informal group based out of Nagpur, requested Modi to consider their degree at par with other professional courses such as architecture, law and medical. The letter said unskilled and non-degree holders have flooded the human resource-heavy industry, making it difficult for their members to find jobs. “We have spent lakhs of rupees on our degrees and in return the starting jobs are available at low monthly salaries of Rs 12,000,” said Manish Kudbe, a member of the association. Similar letters were also sent to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and other heavy weight politicians in Maharashtra. “It is no surprise that our graduates are forced to look for job opportunities abroad. There’s virtually nothing available in most cities here as positions are getting filled up through unskilled workforce,” said Zafar Ali, a graduate from a hotel management institute. The group wants that government must make it mandatory for all those working in the hospitality industry to hold professional degrees. “Just like doctors need MBBS, lawyers need LLB and architects need B.Arch, similarly everyone in the hospitality industry must have sector-related qualifications certified by a competent authority,” said Harvinder Singh, a hotel management graduate. The letter to PM Modi also said that even entrepreneurs wishing to invest in the industry must have a hotel management diploma/degree. “Without such a certification, government must not give them permission to start a restaurant or hotel. If such people have already opened their businesses, then they must be asked to acquire the requisite qualification to continue,” the letter said. “And, it must be made mandatory all such restaurants and hotels to employ only hotel management students so that skilled labour gets its rightful due,” said Rahul Thakur, also a member of the association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/only-degree-holders-should-enter-hospitality-industry-hotel-mgmt-students-write-to-pm/articleshow/82009821.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 30 shifted after oxygen shortage||There was a sudden shortage of oxygen supply to nearly 30 critical patients at the newly-inaugurated parking plaza field hospital in Thane on Saturday evening, forcing the civic body to relocate them to Global hospital at Saket. The facility has an oxygen tank of 13 tonnes to handle most of the 350-plus beds there. Patients were shifted in special ambulances with oxygen facilities. “We had to immediately classify patients and prioritise critical ones to be shifted. There were few ambulances to handle the emergency. The shifting was slow but we ensured the condition of patients was not affected,” an official said. Additional civic chief Ganesh Deshmukh said there was a delay in arrival of oxygen supply from the plant. “We were assured of supply by late night but we did not want to take any chance, so we shifted the patients. The situation will be normal by Sunday morning after which we will resume admitting oxygen patients there,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-30-shifted-after-oxygen-shortage/articleshow/82010576.cms||Manoj Badgeri

Hotel owners across various towns and cities in Maharashtra are protesting by displaying placards and seeking either financial assistance from government or permission to reopen for dine-ins. Piyush Rathi, a hotel owner from Buldhana district, said in smaller towns the speed of business recovery is extremely slow, hence their condition is worse when compared to bigger places like Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur. “The industry had lost all its business after the lockdown came into effect. Even last year for almost seven months we had a near zero business type of scenario. But the obligations of the establishments, including rental and salary expenses, servicing of debts and statutory payments continued all through this period,” said Rathi. He added that government must refund money charged for various licences, which runs into lakhs, because “it’s the state which has forced us to close down”. Tejinder Singh Renu, president of Nagpur Residential Hotels’ Association (NRHA), agrees that smaller towns are indeed struggling. “In cities we get a mix of government officials coming to town and some medical tourism too. But for smaller towns, chances of these two types of guests coming is almost nil,” said Renu. The city businessman said that government must provide relief in the amount collected for bar licences as their establishment is completely closed||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hotel-owners-from-small-towns-hit-hardest-seek-relief/articleshow/82018854.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Mumbai||As Maharashtra orders dept probe, ex-CP to seek legal recourse||MUMBAI: If the Uddhav Thackeray-led government decides to initiate a departmental probe against former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, he is preparing for a long-drawn legal battle with the government. “I have a fundamental right to approach the high court. I do not know the plan of the government. I am consulting my lawyers. If the government initiates a departmental probe, I will act as per the advice of my lawyers,’’ Singh told TOI on Saturday. Days after an unceremonious exit as Mumbai police commissioner, Singh wrote a strongly-worded letter to the chief minister, saying, home minister Anil Deshmukh has asked assistant police inspector Sachin Waze to mobilize Rs 100 crore per month from hotels, restaurants and bars in Mumbai. Then he filed a writ petition before the high court, which asked Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe the allegations and submit a report within 15 days. The state government approached the Supreme Court, but there was no relief. Meanwhile, before relinquishing the charge, Deshmukh on April 1 approved a proposal for conducting a preliminary probe against Singh for breach of all-India service rules. The task of conducting the preliminary probe was entrusted to director-general of police (DGP) Sanjay Pandey, who has been told to submit the report as early as possible. Deputy secretary (home) Kailash Gaikwad wrote a two-page letter to Pandey on the terms of reference. Pandey will have to examine if there was dereliction of duty by Singh while controlling and supervising his subordinates. It was stated in Gaikwad’s letter that after Waze was reinstated, he was given charge of crime intelligence unit, despite opposition of then joint commissioner (crime), and Waze was reporting directly to the police commissioner. Initially, Waze was the investigating officer in the bomb-planting case but was arrested by National Investigation Agency (NIA), leading one to conclude that officials from the police chief’s office were involved in the conspiracy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-as-state-orders-dept-probe-ex-cp-to-seek-legal-recourse/articleshow/82010238.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Ahmedabad||Rajkot-based startup’s software audits accounts in seconds||RAJKOT: In what could disrupt the accounting world, a Rajkot-based tech startup has come out with a software called iAudit that can complete a three-month account audit in just 30 seconds. Founded by three partners — two chartered accounts and a techie from IIT Roorkee — the firm Infylitics has been ranked among the top 10 startups in South Asia in a startup competition organized by Innopreneurs, which is a platform for startup founders, entrepreneurs, and aspirants to showcase their ideas. The startup’s software, iAudit, is a web-based application which automates Internal audit processes and helps organizations manage their risks in an accurate, comprehensive, and time-bound manner. The founders of this startup strongly believe that their tool has the capacity to change the entire audit system, which currently works manually. “Audit is a crucial task, but even multinational companies do sample audits because the auditing process takes much time. I had been working to develop a software since the last three years and finally I have succeeded in developing one that allows any company to audit all the transactions and that too in a very short period,” said Infylitics founder and CEO Palak Vasa, a chartered accountant who audited several group companies during his stint with the multinational conglomerate ITC. Vasa along with his two partners founded the startup in August 2020. The other two co-founders are Smit Parsania and Mansi Jain. Parsania, Vasa’s school friend, completed his MTech from IIT Roorkee and worked for e-commerce major Flipkart as a senior software developer. Mansi, who studied chartered accountancy with Vasa, worked with two big companies and also handled the accounts of telecom companies. These young entrepreneurs are of the view that early warning signals during an internal audit are the key to avoiding the large number of bank frauds, and their application can help detect frauds in early stages because of its speed. When launched, the company had only two clients, Balaji Wafers and Rajkot Nagrik Co-operative Bank. Currently, the startup’s clientele has grown to seven. The startup, which clocked a turnover of Rs 11 lakh in one year, aims to take its turnover to Rs 5 crore by March 2022. At present, Infylitics employs 15 people. “Infylitics received a prize of US$ 11,000 (about Rs 8 lakh) when it won the startup contest by Innopreneurs. In addition, the state government has also approved a grant of Rs 20 lakh considering the need and importance of the product developed by the iAudit team,” added Smit Parsania. “India is heading to become a 5 trillion dollar economy, and for that to happen, the compliance ecosystem needs to be strong. Our compliance ecosystem will become strong by the combined efforts of all finance professionals. The iAudit tool empowers all professionals to reduce compliance burden and promote ease of doing business,” added Vasa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rajkot-based-startups-software-audits-accounts-in-seconds/articleshow/82009851.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Delhi||FCI counters to be set up in Narela Mandi from tomorrow: Gopal Rai||NEW DELHI: Amid farmers’ demands, Food Corporation of India counters will be set up in Narela Mandi from Monday for wheat procurement at MSP rates, Delhi agriculture minister Gopal Rai said. The announcement came on Saturday after a meeting of the Delhi agriculture department, Food Corporation of India and mandi officials. The registrations will be open from 10 am to 5 pm, and coupons will be given to farmers from there itself. The coupons will have a date mentioned on them on which the farmers can bring their crops to the godown for sale. Farmers at the mandi were facing problems because of the absence of FCI counters there, said Rai. “The setting up of counters will save farmers’ time. Now, they will neither have to follow a long and tedious process of registration nor be forced to run from pillar to post to sell their crops,” Rai said in a statement, adding that he himself had visited the mandi on Friday and found no FCI counter there to buy foodgrains at MSP. Rai further said, “BJP functionary Ramvir Singh Bidhuri had falsely claimed that counters have already been set up in Narela Mandi and demanded my resignation. Bidhuri must make proper investigations into the matter and then make statements, and not rely on half-baked knowledge to do so.” “The counters were set up in godowns, and not mandis, however, the latter was the demand of farmers,” he added. “Within Delhi, FCI counters were set up in three areas — Mayapuri, Najafgarh Mandi and Narela Godown of FCI. However, farmers demanded that the counters must be installed in the mandi as well. Hence, this decision has been taken. Officials of the agriculture department, mandis, and FCI will be present at the counters,” the agriculture minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fci-counters-to-be-set-up-in-narela-mandi-from-tomorrow-rai/articleshow/82009836.cms||---
---||Kochi||Systemic failure if woman sans man’s support feels worthless: HC||KOCHI: If a woman feels she is nothing without the support of a man, it is the failure of the system, the high court said while suggesting that the government should introduce a support scheme for single mothers. A division bench comprising justices A Muhamed Mustaque and Kauser Edappagath made the observation in a case in which a single mother (named as ‘Anitha’ by the court to protect privacy) had to give up her child for adoption out of anxiety about her status as a single mother and considering her child’s future. This was after her live-in partner was estranged for a few years. In a country where people worship Goddess, in the land where people have been taught about woman, in the state where we boast cent percent literacy, our attitude to woman is despising; a single mother has no financial or social support, the court said while quoting from Manusmriti. Single mothers who chose to carry their child to full term and give birth face emotional challenges and is forced to believe she is destined to be isolated as a result of guilt, the court noted while stressing that it is time for the government to evolve a scheme to support the single mother. Referring to chat messages between the single mother and the social worker, the court said they show how vulnerable it is for a woman becoming a mother outside a legally-wedded relation. Anitha was willing to bear the child but was not allowed by circumstances in the society, the court said. “She thought without the support of man, she cannot survive. If a woman feels she is nothing without the support of the man that is the failure of the system,” the court said. Asking the government to evolve a scheme to support single mothers, the court said, “It is for the state to make her realize that her struggle with the forces undermining her existence can be validated with the support of rule of law. That self belief must be her identity and respect due to her.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/systemic-failure-if-woman-sans-mans-support-feels-worthless-hc/articleshow/82009855.cms||---
---||Delhi||A 3rd of N corpn med staff yet to take jab||New Delhi: At a time when the national capital is witnessing the fourth wave of novel coronavirus, vaccination data of North Delhi Municipal Corporation shows that around one-third of the civic body’s healthcare workers have still not been inoculated. The report also shows that zones in outer Delhi, like Narela, are way behind the target, while some departments also need to catch up. While the north civic body had targeted to cover 4,808 healthcare staff from hospitals like Hindu Rao, Kasturba, Rajan Babu, Girdhari Lal, Maharishi Valmiki infectious diseases, medical college and mother and child welfare centres, it was only able to inoculate 68.5% of the personnel till last week. The rate is even lower in Ayush facilities, the alternative medicine department. They have achieved a cumulative vaccination rate of only 46.9%. While homeopathy units have given jabs to 66% staffers, Ayurveda has vaccinated 48% and the Unani department 14.6%. Out of 231 Ayurveda health staffers, 111 have taken the shots. The figure is 37 out of 56 homeopathy personnel and six out of 41 Unani practitioners. In other departments, 26,900 out of 33,534 beneficiaries have taken the vaccine. The coverage stands at 84.6% in the sanitation department where 18,145 employees have been inoculated. Around 67% of the 6,865 education staff members and teachers in primary schools have been covered, while the horticulture department has covered 75% workers. Some sections still remain way behind the target, like house tax department at 25.4% and community services at just 12%. The data also throws interesting patterns in geographical coverage. Urban centres like Karol Bagh (99%) and Keshavpuram (94.7%) lead in the vaccine drive, while rural belts like Narela zone have vaccinated just 43.7% of the beneficiaries. In Old Delhi’s City Sadar-Paharganj zone, 85% of the workers have been vaccinated, while the coverage stands at 65% in Rohini and 68% in Civil Lines zones. To encourage more people to get vaccinated, mayor Jai Prakash recently announced that if all eligible members of a family got vaccinated, they could avail a 5% rebate in property tax returns. The total number of vaccine beneficiaries in north corporation-run vaccine centres crossed 1 lakh on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-3rd-of-n-corpn-med-staff-yet-to-take-jab/articleshow/82021970.cms||Paras Singh
---||Delhi||NW Delhi village becoming new hub of illegal units; DPCC notice to 80||New Delhi: With over 80 factories being served show-cause notices by Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) for causing air and water pollution, Libaspur village in northwest Delhi has become a hub of illegal industrial units.Officials said these units directly discharge effluents into drains or emit noxious particles in the air. Even National Green Tribunal (NGT) had directed chief secretary of Delhi last month to look into a plea alleging industrial pollution in Libaspur. According to a DPCC official, these 80 units are involved in different activities like dying textiles, rolling and pickling units, metal, packaging units and manufacturing of plastic. Most do not have a license to operate, while others flout the norms under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. These units do not have proper mechanism in place to control emissions and have no effluent treatment plants, and discharge waste directly into the drains causing water pollution. “These factories pop up overnight and if they are shut down, they again become functional at another place. There are some villages where many such illegal units are operational. We are conducting a drive against such unauthorised units operational in some city villages,” said a DPCC official. The official added that that some parts of Libaspur come under non-conforming areas. “We are conducting a drive here along with the coordination of municipal corporations and other agencies. We have served show-cause notices to 80 units and we will take stringent action, including closing them down, with the help of corporations. We will also impose environmental damage compensation on defaulting units.” A plea filed in the NGT against illegal industrial units in Libaspur village alleged that industries in the area are conducting hazardous, dangerous and polluting activities, affecting the health of locals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nw-delhi-village-becoming-new-hub-of-illegal-units-dpcc-notice-to-80/articleshow/82009856.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Delhi||Delhi: RWAs approach LG over sealing of borewells in parks||NEW DELHI: In a joint letter, 44 residents’ welfare associations of south Delhi have appealed to lieutenant governor to look into the issue of borewell closure in parks. Borewells in most of the parks have either been sealed, or are going to be sealed soon by municipality on the instructions of National Green Tribunal. The tribunal had issued an order in 2019 for sealing of borewells to improve groundwater level. The RWAs claim that as the parks are drying up, sealing of borewells would discourage residents from maintaining them in the future. They have urged the LG to call a joint meeting with the agencies concerned, and have also suggested measures for improving groundwater level in their areas. “While all of us are in agreement about the necessity of not using the fast-depleting groundwater for watering public parks, closure of borewells like this seems to be abrupt and has left us in a bind. Given the current polluted and environmentally degraded state of the city, parks are perhaps the only refreshing green spaces for citizens and we need a solution to conserve these. It would be unfair to let these parks dry without finding an immediate solution,” said Ruby Makhija, secretary of the Navjiwan Vihar RWA. Many RWAs in south Delhi have taken over the maintenance of parks from the local civic body on public-private partnership basis. They irrigate the parks from borewells installed by the municipality. As per the order, supply of water was supposed to be done through tankers (as a short-term measure) in parks within five-kilometre radius of the sewer treatment plant and later through supply lines. “But the process of supplying water through tankers is not feasible as there are limited tankers with corporations and supplying water through pipelines is a long-term project. Also, even after sealing of borewells, no concrete relief was provided by South Delhi Municipal Corporation or Delhi Jal Board. Therefore, we raised concerns with the civic body, which had filed a petition in NGT some time back,” said Vani Aggrawal, general secretary of New RWA, Chattarpur Enclave Phase-II. The green court had disposed of the petition on April 2 while directing chief secretary to resolve the dispute between SDMC and DJB over supply of water through tankers. “We requested the LG to call a joint meeting with different agencies to find an immediate solution to this problem. We also suggested a rainwater harvesting system, implementation of a dual network of pipes for sewage and non-sewage water for their reuse after treatment and making reservoirs for storage purpose,” said GL Verma, president of Ekta Apartments RWA in Saket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rwas-approach-lg-over-sealing-of-borewells-in-parks/articleshow/82009848.cms||Vibha Sharma

The norm will be followed while filling up 127 posts — of assistants and typists — at the two universities. “We have received the government order and guidelines, apart from the roster points, for implementation of the EWS quota only two days ago. Just like other reservations — SC/ST/OBC or for physically handicapped — some vacancies from the posts notified will be reserved for candidates who meet the EWS quota eligibility,” said A Vani Prasad, secretary, TSPSC. In February this year, the Telangana government issued orders implementing a 10% quota for EWS candidates in educational institutions and initial appointments in state government posts. Subsequently, the TSPSC issued notification for various vacancies in the two universities on March 31. “The commission will implement (the GO) for TSPSC direct recruitment notifications (including notification no 03/2021) for senior assistant/junior assistant-cum-typist in P V Narasimha Rao Telangana Veterinary University and junior assistant-cum-typist in Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agriculture University in the state of Telangana,” read the notification. Of the 127 posts, 102 have been notified for junior assistant-cum-typist at the agriculture university while 15 and 10 posts have been earmarked for senior assistant and junior assistant-cum-typist respectively, at veterinary university.

---||Nagpur||Larger dhole packs in low tiger density areas: Study||Nagpur: Researchers with Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, have found out an inverse relationship between density of tigers and pack size of dholes while accounting for variability in resources and habitat heterogeneity. The latest study by WII scientists and researchers Aishwarya Bhandari, Pallavi Ghaskadbi, Parag Nigam and Bilal Habib observed a larger dhole pack size (16.8 ± 3.1) at the site where tiger density was low (0.46/100sqkm), whereas a smaller pack size (6.4 ± 1.3) in the site with higher tiger density (5.36/100sqkm). The study was also published in the March 23 issue of Wiley Online Library. The researchers have identified seven packs from Tadoba-Andhari National Park (TATR) and five from Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (NNTR). The number of individuals in a dhole pack ranged from 7 to 12 for TATR and 10 to 28 in NNTR. The reported average pack size was 6.4 and 16.8 for TATR and NNTR, respectively. A significant difference was found between the pack size of TATR and NNTR. Tigers are the apex predators followed by dhole and leopard. In this study, the researchers attempted to understand the variation in the pack size of social carnivores — dholes — at TATR in Chandrapur, and NNTR in Gondia-Bhandara districts. TATR has an area of 625sqkm core and 1,127.17sqkm buffer, and NNTR has 656sqkm core and 1,241.24sqkm buffer area. “Our results for the distribution‐wide assessment were concordant with local‐scale results, showing a negative association of pack size with tiger densities and a positive association with the prey abundance. It advances our understanding to answer the age‐old question of “what drives the pack size of social predators in a multi-predator system?” says one of the lead authors and researcher Bilal Habib. There is a significant variation in the pack size of dholes at the two neighbouring protected areas (PAs) having similar ecological settings. To understand this intra-specific variation, the researchers investigated underlying factors that potentially govern group size variation in social carnivores. “We further elucidate our site‐specific patterns at a larger scale by doing a distribution‐wide assessment of pack size across dhole range countries. We found that dhole packs would be smaller in higher tiger density areas,” said another lead researcher Ghaskadbi. She adds, “The pack size would be positively correlated to higher prey density, whereas it would be physiologically beneficial to be in smaller groups when prey resources are scarce. It hypothesizes that larger dhole packs would positively correlate to contiguous undisturbed habitat patches, whereas small packs, would be associated with small and disturbed habitat patches.” Dhole packs have been observed to be smaller in hilly terrains in comparison to flat terrains as an adaptation to the spatial distribution of prey and its availability. Therefore, the researchers also investigated if pack size is influenced by terrain type. According to International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), India has the largest dhole population across the dhole range countries. Within India, there is an apparent variation in dhole pack sizes — the smallest dhole packs of 2–3 individuals are reported from the evergreen forest and rugged terrain of the northeast, whereas the average pack size of around 12-14 individuals is reported from dry deciduous forest of central and southern India. With the total sampling effort of 9,144 trap nights in TATR and 13,440 trap nights in NNTR, the teams obtained 452 and 211 photo captures on tigers in TATR and NNTR, respectively. A total of 58 tigers (32 males & 26 females) in TATR and 8 tigers (4 males & 4 females) in NNTR were identified through camera trap images. The high tiger density in TATR indicates small packs of dholes and high packs in NNTR due to low tiger density. The study found that the dhole pack size in NNTR was 2.62 times bigger than the pack size in TATR. The smaller pack size of dholes in the higher tiger density scenario could be because of two reasons. Firstly, intense intra-guild competition and associated risk of fatal injuries negatively affect dholes in TATR. Secondly, larger groups can successfully defend their kills and also consume the prey quickly, leaving minimal chances to attract other competitors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/larger-dhole-packs-in-low-tiger-density-areas-study/articleshow/82010234.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Surat||Surat: BJP distributes 1,000 remdesivir injections obtained from ‘friends’||SURAT: Amid massive shortage of remdesivir injections across the state, the city unit of Surat BJP on Saturday was seen distributing 1,000 vials of the much-needed Covid-19 treatment drug for free to citizens when the state-run New Civil Hospital and SMIMER Hospital had a day earlier declared they had run out of stock. The free distribution raised eyebrows over how the party could procure such a large stock of injection as the entire state is facing a shortage. While the party sources claim they had placed an order for 5,000 injections and was only trying to help needy people, chief minister Vijay Rupani stated that the government had not supplied the life-saving drug to the party unit.“You need to ask CR (Paatil) how he managed the injections. But he had done this was he is concerned about Surat’s people,” CM told media person when asked where did the BJP chief got the remdesivir injections for free distribution. Long queue was witnessed outside the BJP office at Udhna where patients’ kin were given the injection on the basis of doctor’s prescription. Questions were also raised as to how could BJP distribute a schedule-H drug from its party premises without a license even if people were bringing doctors’ prescriptions. “They may have tied up with a chemist for distributing the drug,” said Patel. Surat collector Dhaval Patel too said that the CM has already clarified. But opposition parties criticized the gesture stating that it was a photo-op. Several doctors too questioned the move on their social media profiles. Meanwhile, when asked by media persons about the distribution of remdesivir in Surat, BJP MP and state party president CR Paatil said that the injections had been procured by some friends in the city and distributed at market rate by the party. He said that the party was committed to distribute 5,000 injections. Paatil, who was in Morva Hadaf in Panchmahal district for the assembly bypolls, said that the party was only supplementing the efforts of the government. “The injection is available free for patients in government hospitals. There was a shortage of the injections in private hospitals and for patients in home quarantine,” he claimed. Commenting on BJP’s move, Gujarat Congress president Amit Chavda, who too was in Morva Hadaf on Saturday said that the chief minister should investigate Paatil’s source of injections. “At a time when people were feeling helpless and running around for injections, CM should explain whether these had been stolen or robbed,” alleged Chavda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/bjp-distributes-1000-remdesivir-injections-got-from-friends/articleshow/82008775.cms||---

Police said they have identified the accused and various teams were carrying out raids to nab him. Meanwhile, 22-year-old Arjun, who sustained bullet injuries, was operated upon, and is currently in the ICU. Postmortem of his cousin Yash, a law student who was shot, was carried out and the body was handed over to his family on Saturday. The incident took place around 2.30pm when both of them were returning from Arjun’s college after paying his fees. The CCTV footage was analysed and the accused identified. Police said on their way back from the college, the victims had stopped at a CNG pump. In the clip, the victims, Arjun and Yash, can be seen behind the accused’s car. “On seeing a wide gap between the accused’s car and the vehicle ahead, Arjun steps out and asks him to move. This leads to an argument between the two,” said a senior police officer. “Arjun and Yash first thrashed the accused, following which he whipped out a country-made pistol and fired at them,”the officer added. While one bullet hit Yash, Arjun was shot twice. The injured were rushed to a hospital where Yash was declared brought dead.

But some hospitals were prescribing it randomly. We have been discussing with private hospitals about revisiting the protocols while prescribing the injection,” he said, adding that the district administration would monitor the demand and supply closely.Rao, the Pune divisional commissioner, said there was no shortage of remdesivir supply to Pune. He said the district had 14.5% of the total active cases in the state and the drug’s allocation was made accordingly. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh late on Saturday evening issued detailed directives to ease the trouble of relatives of Covid-19 patients while procuring remdesivir and prevent its black-marketing. He directed the hospitals to procure remdesivir from wholesalers and distributors directly in accordance with the requirement. The hospitals were directed not to make the relatives of patients procure the injections and charge government rates for the drug. According to the directives, the hospitals would have to register themselves as Covid hospitals and fill information about bed availability on the divisional commissioner’s dashboard. Ensuring supply of the drug for three days to the patients admitted and genuine need for the injection are part of the district collector’s order, effective from April 11.Violation of the order is punishable under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and the Indian Epidemic Disease Control Act, 1897, as well as Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), besides other acts and rules.City Congress leader Aba Bagul, meanwhile, said the administration should cap the export of remdesivir.

---||Pune||Pimpri Chinchwad police arrest four for illegally selling injections||PUNE: The social security cell of the Pimpri Chinchwad police arrested four men on the night intervening Friday and Saturday for black-marketing remdesivir vials. Three injections were seized from them. The probe revealed that the vials were illegally taken out of Covid care centres. Acting on a tip-off, a team comprising senior inspector Vitthal Kubde, sub-inspector Pradeepsingh Sisode and officials of the Food and Drug Administration swung into action to arrest the suspects — Aditya Digambar Maidargi (24) of Chinchwad, Pratap Sunil Jadhavwar (24) of Talegaon Dabhade, Ajay Gurudev Morale (24) of Aundh and Muralidhar Subhash Marutkar (24) of Sangvi. The Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash said, “Remdesivir is used for treatment of Covid-19 patients. There is a scarcity of the injection.” He said the four men were employed in different hospitals as “brothers” on temporary basis. “All these hospitals are designated as Covid centres by the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic corporations,” he said. The police got Maidargi’s contact. He said he would provide a remdesivir vial for Rs11,000 and asked for Rs22,000 for two injections,” Prakash said. On Thursday, the state government capped the price of remdesivir injections between Rs1,100 and Rs1,400 per vial. The police laid a trap in Sangvi, nabbed Maidargi and recovered two remdesivir vials from his possession. He revealed Jadhavwar’s identity, following which the police nabbed him and seized a vial from him. Roles of the other two suspects surfaced after his arrest.

---||Delhi||Court takes stern view, no bail for rioting||New Delhi: A man accused in a case of rioting during the violence in northeast Delhi in February 2020 has been denied bail after a city court observed that he was a part of an unlawful assembly that fired shots, leading to a person’s death.Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat in his order observed, “The applicant was part of an unlawful assembly that rioted and fired shots, leading to the death of one Mudassir.”The court order further observed, “Every person involved in the said riots will be held equally liable for all the actions committed or knew were likely to be committed as a result thereof in prosecution of common object and in the pursuance of the conspiracy.”The accused, Mohd Bilal, sought bail on the ground that he had nothing to do with the alleged offence and had been implicated by police on the disclosure statement of the co-accused. His counsel argued that there was no legally admissible evidence against the accused and he had cooperated with police, joining the investigation whenever he was directed.Besides, it was also submitted that Bilal made no attempt to evade police, proving his innocence. “The mobile phone of accused was seized during the investigation, but its CDR was not filed along with the chargesheet, whereas accused has been consistently contending that on the date and time of incident i.e., February 25, 2020, he was not there at the alleged place of occurrence,” the counsel added.Opposing his bail, the state’s prosecutor argued that during interrogation, Bilal had confessed to his involvement in the firing during on February 25, 2020 and disclosed that he was firing towards the police party, but received a push from the mob and deceased Muddasar came into the firing line and was shot.It was also pointed out by the prosecutor that Bilal was allegedly one of the main conspirators of the riots near Shamshan Ghat, Kabir Nagar and he, along with other accused persons, damaged all CCTV cameras in these areas. “He is clearly identified in a CCTV footage in which he is seen damaging the cameras near Shamshan Ghat, Kabir Nagar,” it was submitted.The court, while dismissing the bail plea, also noted that Bilal was previously involved in an attempt to murder case registered with Bhajanpura police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-takes-stern-view-no-bail-for-rioting/articleshow/82009857.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Gold jewellery sector at all-time low||AHMEDABAD: The skyrocketing price of gold, weakened consumer confidence and purchasing power, fewer weddings being organized due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and increased scrap sale of gold took the sheen off gold jewellery purchases in Gujarat in 2020-21. With jewellery demand taking a hit and imports remaining abysmally low in the first half of the fiscal, gold imports plunged to an all-time low level of 29.1 metric tonnes (MT) for the full year. Explaining the annual trend, Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA), said, “Rising price of gold was the biggest deterrent for demand, especially for jewellery. Gold prices touched a record-high level of Rs 58,000 per 10 grams, after which has remained on the lower side. Due to businesses getting impacted in times of the pandemic, wealth on hand reduced and as a result, spending was affected at large. Jewellery being a luxury commodity, it fell last on the priority list of people and therefore, demand was adversely affected.” Very few weddings took place throughout the pandemic year. This was also one of the key reasons for dwindling demand for gold, suggest industry players. “Marriages which were planned, either got postponed or else were called off. Those which took place were low-key. Besides, shrinking incomes and budgets of people for marriage ceremonies also dented jewellery purchases, as people came in with pre-meditated budgets,” said Acharya. Jewellers also lost out on a huge chunk of NRI customers who typically account for high-value gold purchases. With dwindling demand, several jewellery stores and micro and small-scale jewellery manufacturing units shut down amid no business. Employment in the gems and jewellery sector was impacted as well. Increased scrap sales dent import volumesAccording to a report by Care Ratings on the gold market outlook for 2020-21, after the lockdown restrictions eased, there was a rise in scrap sales of gold which built pressure on prices. “Most people who came to buy gold exchanged it against previously bought gold and did not make fresh purchases. This lowered the demand for fresh gold significantly and sales volumes went down,” said a jeweller based in Manek Chowk area of Ahmedabad. Estimates by Jewellers’ Association of Ahmedabad (JAA) suggest that at least 40% of gold jewellery purchases were made through exchanges in full or in part. Little boost from weddings, festive muhuratsWith jewellery demand taking a hit amid rising gold prices and weakening consumer sentiment, overall demand for gold went down and festive muhurats as well as weddings did little to revive sales. Manoj Soni, an Ahmedabad-based jeweller, said, “During the festive season, jewellery demand was mainly driven by wedding purchases, which were pre-meditated and people came in with fixed budgets. Restrictions imposed on public gatherings including those on marriage ceremonies reduced them to a subdued affair, thus denting sales” “On festive muhurats like Akha Trij/ Akshaya Tritiya, Dhanteras, Bestu Varsh, Dussehra and Diwali, when gold purchase is often considered auspicious, the demand remained low. Most people just timed their planned purchases for occasions to coincide with these dates,” said Nanalal Soni, an Ahmedabad-based jeweller. Employment suffersWith a decline in demand, employment in the gems and jewellery sector suffered dearly. While the state saw small-time jewellery stores downing shutters, many artisans who make a living by making jewellery lost their jobs. “Many who migrated to their home states never returned after the lockdown because of lack of work. The decline in demand after the easing of the lockdown left many artisans either without jobs or without adequate wages. These small traders were often dependent on sales from rural areas of Gujarat and job-work from jewellery showrooms. However, as demand declined, revenues began to get affected,” said Haresh Acharya, director, IBJA. Industry estimates indicate that as of date, Gujarat is home to at least 10,000-12,000 jewellery manufacturing units and the industry employs some 80,000 artisans. “At least 30% of artisans and workmen employed at jewellery making units have lost jobs across the state,” said Chinubhai Choksi, president, Manek Chowk Choksi Mahajan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pandemic-takes-the-sheen-off-gold-jewellery-purchases/articleshow/82009872.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Delhi||Delhi: To settle down with girlfriend, engineer kidnaps infant||NEW DELHI: A seven-month-old boy, who had been kidnapped for a ransom of Rs 40 lakh from outer Delhi’s Mohan Garden area on Friday, was rescued within seven hours. Delhi Police has arrested the kidnapper, a computer engineer. He had demanded the ransom to settle down with his girlfriend. A woman had earlier approached Ranhola police station after her child went missing around 12.30 pm on Friday. Shivi Kaushik, the complainant, told the cops that their 24-year-old tenant Priyanshu Kumar came to their house on the pretext of playing with the child and fled with him when she went to another room for some work. The child’s father told police that while he was returning home, he got a call from Kumar who told him that the infant had been kidnapped and that they must pay him Rs 40 lakh if they wanted him back safe. Kumar also called and informed his own father about the kidnapping and asked him to tell the child’s parents to cooperate and arrange for the money immediately. Police then registered a case of kidnapping and started investigation. Deputy commissioner of police (outer) Parvinder Singh said CCTV footage and local questioning about the route taken by the suspect while fleeing with the child established that he had escaped towards Uttam Nagar. “We found that for four kilometres, he walked and then booked a taxi using a mobile phone application. He took the taxi to Ghaziabad. Teams were sent to Ghaziabad to search for him. Meanwhile, information from Anand Vihar was received that a man with an infant has been spotted boarding a taxi towards Vasundhara,” he said. “After more than four hours of chase, our team was able to intercept the taxi near Pankha Road. The kidnapped child was recovered safely. The accused then managed to escape, but he was caught from Uttam Nagar after two hours,” the DCP said. During interrogation, Kumar told the cops that he was a BTech graduate and was currently doing apprenticeship at a company in Sahibabad, Noida. He said that he was in a relationship with a girl from Kanpur where he had studied and that he regularly needed to arrange for money to meet his girlfriend’s demands. “He said he had no job but wanted to settle down finally with the girl and therefore, planned the kidnapping to demand a hefty ransom,” Singh said. A police team has been sent to Kanpur to find out if his girlfriend was also a part of the kidnapping plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/to-settle-down-with-girlfriend-engineer-kidnaps-infant/articleshow/82010246.cms||---
---||Kochi||Tourism sector in Ernakulam stares at yet another crisis||Kochi: The tourism sector in Kochi which had been expecting an almost full vacation season this April-May has got a jolt due to the recent spurt in Covid cases. In the absence of international tourists, those in the industry had been pinning their hopes on domestic tourism, especially on those from north India. The ever increasing number of Covid-19 cases has prompted many of the tourists from other states to cancel their plans to visit Kerala. “The bookings by the tourists from other states in the hotels in Kochi are very low. Normally, there would be a flow of tourists from other states to Kerala and Kochi during summer vacation. But, this time, there is very low footfall. There is hardly any booking in the hotels in Kochi,” an official with the district tourism promotion council (DTPC) said. “Similarly, there would be a flow of tourists from north India during Pooja holidays. This time, there is no chance for the flow during Pooja holidays as well. The Union government as well as the state governments are putting restrictions on the movement of people as the Covid-19 cases are going up day by day,” the official said. The tourism operations which were resumed in November last year has started to gain momentum to a certain extent. “It is the domestic tourists we are depending on now. Footfall is there only on weekends and holidays. Still, the operations had started to pick up momentum,” the official said. The tourism department had started various packages, including trips to various locations in Ernakulam district, to lure the tourists. One-day tour packages to the locations like Thattekkad-Boothathankettu, Kochi City tour, Alappuzha-Fort Kochi, Kochi-Athirappilly, Munnar and Thekkadi had been prepared.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tourism-sector-in-ernakulam-stares-at-yet-another-crisis/articleshow/82009883.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Amid soaring temperatures, Ramzan fasts to last over 14 hours this year||HYDERABAD: It’s going to be hot and long fast this Ramzan, for people in the Telugu states. The minimum duration of fast this Ramzan, scheduled to begin on April 14 or 15 depending on the sighting of the new moon, will be 14 hours in Hyderabad, and a few minutes short of 14 hours in Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam. The maximum duration of fasting will last for 14 hours and 29 minutes in Hyderabad. With the mercury rising by the day and India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicting increase in average day temperatures in the next one month, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has recommended measures for keeping the body hydrated during the non-fasting hours. The temperature in Hyderabad will hover between 35 degrees C and 43 degrees C during the Muslim month of fasting that will last till May 13 or 14. Weather charts show that in Vijayawada the maximum day temperature will be between 37 degrees C and 39 degrees C. In Visakhapatnam the maximum temperature will range from 32 degrees C to 36 degrees C. While the two coastal cities are likely to be relatively cooler than Hyderabad during Ramzan, the high humidity in Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam may cause inconvenience to those on fast, if they venture out during the hot sun, warn health experts. The duration of fasting in Vijayawada will range from 13 hours and 43 minutes to 14 hours and 11 minutes while in Visakhapatnam it will be between 13 hours and 46 minutes and 14 hours and 15 minutes. Luckily, this year Ramzan will not coincide the Rohini Karthe, traditionally the hottest fortnight of the year in these parts. According to a health advisory issued by the WHO for Ramzan, people, who undertake fast, should drink lot of water and consume foods that contain a high-water content like watermelon and cucumber. The WHO advisory recommended that one should drink at least 10 glasses of water between the Iftar (breaking of the fast in the evening) and Sahar (beginning of the fast at dawn). Since high temperature would result in loss of sweat, one should replenish the loss of fluids once the fast is completed. It also recommended consumption of green salad including cucumber and tomato at Sahar and Iftar. "Avoid caffeinated drinks such as coffee, tea and cola, because caffeine can make some people urinate more often, which may lead to dehydration. Also remember that fizzy drinks with sugar will add calories to your diet. Foods rich in water may be served, such as soup or fresh vegetable salad. During the noon hours, when temperatures are high, it is important to remain in a cool and shaded place, and avoid the sun," the WHO advisory said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/amid-soaring-temps-ramzan-fasts-to-last-over-14-hrs-this-year/articleshow/82009868.cms||Syed Akbar

Environment minister Gopal Rai said the government had set a target of reducing air pollution by one-third in the next five years. Based on suggestions from experts and organisations at the conference, the government will formulate a long-term action plan. “Delhi government under the leadership of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has been working for six years to reduce air pollution. The work done in this period has helped but is not enough. To solve the crisis, the CM has guaranteed to bring down air pollution level by a third in the next five years,” Rai said. After “World Air Quality Report, 2020” ranked Delhi as the 10th most polluted city and the top polluted capital city in the world, TOI, in March, had reported that the environment department would conduct a conference with experts from academic institutes, environment-related organisations and NGOs to discuss steps that could be taken to reduce air pollution.

---||Pune||Covid-19: At 0.6%, Pune district’s fatality rate stays stable||PUNE: The Pune district’s weekly case fatality rate (CFR) has remained constant at 0.6% despite an exponential rise in Covid-19 cases in the last one-and-a-half month, indicating that the pandemic continues to remain less virulent. During February 18-24 this year, the district had 7,229 active cases, which increased to 48,149 during March 25-31. However, despite this rapid rise, the district’s weekly CFR has remained between 0.4% and 0.6%. In comparison, the weekly CFR was between 2.2% and 2.5% in the district during the peak month of September last year when the active case count was above 42,000, almost half of the present tally of over 81,500. Medical experts said severe cases requiring ventilator support were much less than the last year’s peak, the prime reason behind lower mortality. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “Though the number of deaths is increasing, the rate is much lower than that of the increase in the number of cases in the district. The weekly CFR is currently much lower than the September last year peak. In fact, latest CFR data for the district indicates that it is not rising at all but has remained constant. In September, as Covid cases began increasing, the CFR rose too. It had remained above 2% till about third week of November 2020 in the district.” During September 10-16 last year, Pune’s CFR was 2.2%, followed by 2.5% and 2.2% during the following weeks. Cut to this year, Pune’s CFR was 0.5% from February 25-March 3 and March 4-10, after which it ranged from 0.4% to 0.6% during the weeks till March 31. Though the district weekly CFR for April 1 to April 7 is under compilation, daily CFR has ranged from 0.6% to 0.7%. Dr Kapil Zirpe, member of the Pune Covid-19 task force and head of the neurotrauma unit of Ruby Hall Clinic, said the government was undertaking aggressive testing and patients were coming to hospitals in a very early phase. “These are the main reasons that have kept mortality low. Besides, the infection has remained more transmissible but less virulent since cases began rising.” He said there were more patients who were moderately ill but requiring oxygen, resulting in a crunch of oxygen supported beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/at-0-6-pune-districts-fatality-rate-stays-stable/articleshow/82009866.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||SPPU conducts first semester papers quite smoothly on day-1||Pune: Day-one of the first semester online examinations, conducted by Savitribai Phule Pune University, on Saturday was relatively smooth as compared to the previous online semester examination that was marred by various complaints from students.The examination department conducted exams for 74 subjects. A total of 28,131 students had registered for the examination while 25,356 appeared on Saturday.Mahesh Kakade, director of the examination and evaluation department, said the robust work done before the examination, such as carefully mapping each student with the subjects s/he is eligible for along with a helpdesk and an exam war room that monitors the entire process, are why there were fewer student complaints this time.“We had decided that we will not entertain any student data that comes after March 28 for this examination. So, unlike last year, we had plenty of time to go through the entire data and ensure every student had filled the exam form correctly. A team of 27 coordinators from various faculties were appointed to scrutinise the forms. Once the data was cleaned up, we were able to give it to the agency on time and they also could work on it by ensuring correct question papers were uploaded, verification of the questions, quality of question papers, etc. Hence, pre-examination work could be done well,” said Kakade.During the examinations, the exam department claims to have resolved 1,500 students’ queries via chatbox. “There were still some complaints regarding user ID, password, etc, but we had a 35-member helpdesk to put out fires whenever needed. Students too are now aware of the entire process. Lastly, we have given the option of re-examination for students, if there was a huge problem causing them to be unable to write the exam, or whenever the cases are genuine as long as the students register their complaint in 48 hours online through the students’ portal,” added Kakade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sppu-conducts-first-semester-papers-quite-smoothly-on-day-1/articleshow/82009879.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Pune||Postponement of exam divides MPSC aspirants||Pune: Students have divided into two groups over the decision of the Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) to postpone the Maharashtra subordinate services non-gazetted group B preliminary combined examination, scheduled to be held this Sunday. One group of students supports the postponement, considering the increasing Covid-19 cases even among candidates preparing for the examination. Another group is worried about the financial pressure the postponement will bring upon them. Not knowing when the examination would be scheduled next is also leading to anxiousness among students. Mahesh Bade, a member of MPSC Students’ Rights Group, said, “These are tough times and students are extremely stressed. Some students had tested positive for Covid-19 but were keeping it under wraps, had close contact with positive people, or had symptoms but were not getting tested for fear of getting a positive result and missing the exam. There were also students, who had tested positive and would have had to miss out on the exam because they were in hospital or isolation rooms. Some students were scared of being at an exam room where all the above category of students could be present and contract the virus. Hence, they were asking for a postponement. The other group was opposed to it because uncertainty over exam dates means they would have to continue to stay in Pune, which is a financial burden for many.” Anup Deshmukh, an MPSC aspirant, said they should be ready to face disasters as this and work under pressure as civil service aspirants. “If civil service candidates are afraid to give tests, then how will they work when pandemic strikes? There are many students, including myself, who have spent many years preparing for the exams. The state services examination was held recently. Many were planning to appear for the exam and leave for their hometowns. A student spends at least Rs 10,000, per month, to live in a city and study. “This is the exam scheduled for March 2020. It got postponed to October and then April. The exam has again been postponed. Another delay means the state will not advertise for the year 2021 due to which many students’ last attempt for a possible 2021 exam is all but gone.

---||Delhi||IIIT-Delhi on mission to ward off threats from space debris||NEW DELHI: Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi ((IIIT-Delhi) has received research funding from National Super Computing Mission (NSM) to develop a method to predict collision threats from space debris. The project, Orbit computation of Resident Space Objects for Space Situational Awareness, has to be completed in two years. “There are more than 20,000 man-made objects of more than 10cm in size floating around in near-earth space that pose collision threats to functional satellites. Predicting collision probability from these space objects is crucial from the national security perspective and for the protection of public and private space assets of Indian origin,” said IIIT-Delhi faculty Sanat K Biswas, who is leading the project along with a colleague, Arun Balaji Buduru. Biswas said the “outcome of this project will directly support the Indian space sector, valued at $7 billion (Rs 51,334 crore), by providing an operationally flexible, scalable, transparent and indigenous collision probability solution”. Space debris poses a global threat to the continued use of space-based technologies that support critical functions like communication, transport, remote sensing, and weather and climate monitoring. Academia, industries and space agencies around the world are working to address this issue. Through this project, IIIT-Delhi will contribute to the global effort towards space sustainability, the institute stated. NSM is being implemented by the central department of science and technology in collaboration with the Union ministry of electronics and information technology to ensure the country’s leadership in supercomputing. The real amount of space debris is said to be between 500,000 and one million pieces as current sensor technology cannot detect smaller objects. They travel at speeds up to 28,162kmph, fast enough for a relatively small piece of orbital debris to damage a satellite or a spacecraft. India has over 50 functional satellites in space. It’s also planning to launch its own space station in the coming years. Last December, Indian Space Research Organisation set up a dedicated Space Situational Awareness (SSA) Control Centre, Netra, in Bengaluru to monitor, track and protect the national space assets and function as a hub of all SSA activities. Only the US, Russia and Europe have similar facilities to track space objects and share collision warnings. Once Netra is fully functional, India won’t be dependent on North American Aerospace Defence Command for tracking space objects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/iiit-on-mission-to-ward-off-threats-from-space-debris/articleshow/82010273.cms||---

The deceased, Puneet Gupta, was a resident of Pandav Nagar in east Delhi, police said. Gupta was issuing challans along with the transport department personnel and had flagged down a truck. The driver allegedly tried to escape, but when Gupta did not give way, he accelerated and fled after mowing him down. Gupta got dragged with the vehicle for several meters. The transport department personnel raised an alarm and alerted the police control room at 1.12am, which sent a team to the spot. The accused driver, Devinder Singh, was chased and caught by the PCR van patrolling the area. He was arrested and the vehicle impounded. Gupta was rushed to Venkateswara Hospital, where he was declared brought dead and the body was later handed over to the family after postmortem. An FIR under section 304A (causing death due to negligence) of IPC and 279 (rash driving) has been registered. As the offences are bailable, Singh, who is a resident of Najafgarh, has been released on bail. He told the cops that he could not stop the vehicle as Gupta came in front suddenly. As the cops and others chased him, he got scared and fled, he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/civil-defence-staff-mowed-by-truck/articleshow/82022074.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||NCLAT stays CoC formation for Oyo subsidiary||Ahmedabad: Oyo Hotels and Homes Pvt Ltd (OHHPL) got some reprieve after the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) ordered the interim resolution professional (IRP) to not constitute a committee of creditors (CoC) till the next hearing on April 15. But the bankruptcy proceedings will continue according to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) as the appellate tribunal has not stayed the corporate insolvency resolution process in its two-page order that was put on its website late on Thursday. OHHPL is faced with legal action after an operational creditor Rakesh Yadav filed bankruptcy proceedings against it over non-payment of dues of Rs 16 lakh. The Ahmedabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) recently ordered bankruptcy proceedings against OHHPL. Oravel Stays Pvt Limited, the parent company of Softbank-backed OYO Rooms, challenged the NCLT order earlier this week and said that the disputed amount has already been paid to the claimant. “The NCLAT has ordered a stay on formation of CoC for Oyo Hotels and Homes Pvt Ltd. The tribunal has however allowed the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) to continue,” said advocate Noopur K Dalal who appeared on behalf of the IRP in NCLAT. The board of directors remains suspended for now with the appointment of Yadav as the IRP. In a statement on Thursday, Oyo said, “The NCLAT provided a stay for the formation of COC in IBC proceedings against OHHPL, a subsidiary of Oyo. OHHPL appealed the order in front of NCLAT and explained that a demand draft of Rs 16 lakh was issued to the claimant under protest and the claimant has willingly banked the DD.” “The IRP may not constitute Committee of Creditors till the next date. In the meantime, the ‘Interim Resolution Professional’ will ensure that the company remains going concern and will take assistance of the (suspended) Board of Directors,” states the NCLAT order. The counsel for Oyo told NCLAT that there was a confusion as the dues were payable by ‘My Preferred Transformation and Hospitality Pvt Ltd’ and not OHHPL. Oyo would be making efforts to settle so that the operational creditor can withdraw the application filed under Section 12A of IBC, the company told NCLAT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/nclat-stays-coc-formation-for-oyo-subsidiary/articleshow/82006078.cms||Maulik Pathak

Vinod Mishra (BJP) said their reinstatement must be scrapped immediately as it was not as per rules. “This seems to be a clear-cut attempt to bring back tainted engineers in the name of Covid. These are the Sachin Wazes of BMC,” Mishra said. TOI had reported that BMC reinstated assistant engineer M G Shelar and junior engineer Dharmaraj Shinde, who were charged with criminal negligence, dereliction of duty, connivance with mala fide intention and failure to take action. “Reinstating people responsible for the death of 14 innocent people, and putting them back in charge two years later is a big blow to the spirit of Mumbai. This has to be recalled,” said Samajwadi Party MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-scrap-recall-of-2-tainted-engineers/articleshow/82010278.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The district collector Dhaval Patel issued a notification on Friday declaring the night curfew from 8pm to 6am. The night curfew was imposed from Saturday night and will be in effect till April 30. Officials said that lately during the Holi festivities people used to crowd in public places despite the appeal for maintaining social distancing. In market areas and eateries too, people gather in large numbers due to which the night curfew had to be imposed. The number of people allowed at a wedding has also been brought down to 100 while in other gatherings only 50 people will be allowed. All social and political gatherings have been suspended till April 30. However, all essential and emergency services will be allowed during the curfew hours. Earlier this week, the state government had imposed night curfew in 16 towns and cities apart from the four major municipal corporation areas in the wake of high court’s observations on the pandemic situation in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/night-curfew-in-surat-district-areas-too/articleshow/82008847.cms||---

The hottest station was Sports Complex at 39.4 degrees Celsius, followed by Najafgarh at 39.2 degrees Celsius. The minimum at Safdarjung settled at 17.1 degrees Celsius— three degrees below normal. The maximum may touch 38 degrees on Sunday and is likely to reach 39 degrees Celsius on Tuesday. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist, IMD and head, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, said, “The day temperature may rise from Sunday and is likely to remain four notches above normal in the next few days. As another western disturbance is likely to impact the region, the temperature may dip slightly again.” Delhi’s air quality, meanwhile, remained in the “moderate” category with an AQI of 181.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mercury-to-rise-but-no-heatwave/articleshow/82010280.cms||---
---||Delhi||Ruckus on campus: AUD student told to pay Rs 40k||New Delhi: The proctor’s office of Ambedkar University Delhi (AUD) has disallowed its student Priyansh Maurya from attending his final semester until he pays a fine of nearly Rs 40,000, gets an apology letter from his parents and goes through anger management sessions. The order was issued on April 9, a month after students had assembled at the Kashmere Gate and Karampura campuses of the varsity demanding reopening them and restarting physical classes. Some students had even made graffiti on the campus walls. Irked at this, the AUD administration passed an order debarring Maurya from the Kashmere Gate campus. Questioning the order, SFI, the students’ group to which Maurya belongs, stated that the punishment showed the “authoritarian attitude” of the vice-chancellor and the administration. “Priyansh has been heavily penalised for his actions to try and save the democratic ethos of the university. Apart from a hefty fine of Rs 40,000 and an apology letter from his parents, he is being sent to AUD’s Ehsaas Clinic for anger management. He has been de-enrolled from the winter semester 2021, which will stop him from graduating by one year,” SFI said in a statement. The student body further claimed, “No student has ever been asked to repeat an entire year for making graffiti on the campus walls. The administration is setting a dangerous precedent and trying to curb the voices of the student community.” Maurya said, “I’m in utter shock to see the proctor’s order for protesting for reopening the campus and making graffiti on walls, which has been AUD’s culture. Imposing such a heavy penalty on me shows how much the administration is scared of students’ voices. I deny that I made graffiti in uncontrollable anger for which I’m being referred to Ehsaas Clinic for anger management. I made graffiti because I wanted to reclaim AUD’s walls after the whitewash. However, the administration is mentally torturing me by releasing arbitrary orders.” Responding to TOI, the AUD administration said the defacement came to the notice of the proctorial board, which constituted a committee to inquire into the alleged incident. The student was fined 50% of the cost of repairing the defaced property. The university said graffiti was allowed on the Wall of Democracy in the Kashmere Gate campus, which could be used by students to express themselves. The campus was recently renovated because of the scheduled visit of an NAAC peer team.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ruckus-on-campus-aud-student-told-to-pay-rs-40k/articleshow/82022114.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Indulging in mangoes becomes expensive affair||COIMBATORE: It’s the season of juicy and sweet mangoes, which have found prominent slots in fruit stalls, where they are displayed in a manner to tickle your fancy. But the mango lovers have to spend more this time to satisfy their taste buds. Wholesalers and retailers say the price has gone up by 30% to 100%, depending on the variety, because of shortage of supply this year. According to them, the unexpected rain in January and increase in pest attack have hit the mango production. Large fruit retailers across the city have a number of mango varieties - right from Banganapalli and Alphonso to Senthuram and Imam Pasand – on offer. However, it is an expensive affair to indulge in them. While 1kg of good quality Banganapalli costs around Rs 90 per kg, Imam Pasandh is priced at Rs 180 per kg. “We are seeing huge increase in wholesale prices itself,” says A Faisal, joint secretary, Coimbatore Corporation Fruits and Vegetables Commission Agents Association. The wholesale price of Banganapalli was only Rs 25 to Rs 50 per kg based on quality. Now, it is priced at Rs 40 to Rs 80. The price of Imam Pasandh has also gone up to Rs 150 per kg from Rs 100 to Rs 110. Senthuram has seen the wholesale price doubling to Rs 40 to Rs 80 from Rs 20 to Rs 40, he said. The increase in price is attributed to a shortage of supply across the country. Dorairaj Chinnasamy, of Pazhamudhir Nilayam, said, “The unseasonal rain in January clashed with the mango flowering season and it has resulted in fall in production. Because of this, many traders from North India and other parts of the country such as Calcutta, Nagpur, Mumbai and New Delhi are buying mangoes from the district.” While mangoes are yet to arrive from Anamalai in a full-fledged manner, large quantities are unlikely to arrive from the region. “We are likely to see extremely low yield this year, because of continuous pest attacks during the flowering season. It has affected both the yield and quality,” says K Veeramani, who had cultivated mangoes on 20 acres, from Marappangoundanpudur. “While I usually make a profit of Rs 1 lakh per acre, this year I may incur a loss.” Another mango farmer from the region, Arul Mohan Prabhakar, said constant drizzling through the northeast monsoon had also hit the fruit production. It is to be noted that the production has fallen this year, despite the area under mango cultivation in the district going up by 13%. “The price may come down in May once arrivals increase in North India and traders from there stop buying the fruit from here,” says Durai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/indulging-in-mangoes-becomes-expensive-affair/articleshow/82009540.cms||---
---||Pune||Remdesivir has no impact on Covid mortality, don't panic-buy: Doctors||PUNE: The rush to secure doses of the antiviral remdesivir is unfounded as it has little or no impact on survival in those hospitalised with Covid-19, leading doctors and members of the state task force have said. The drug, first developed to treat hepatitis C and later tested against Ebola and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), does not hold life-saving benefits for Covid-19 patients and can only help reduce hospital stay by two or three days, doctors said. In guidelines issued last year, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said the intravenous drug cannot be used as standard care and remains beneficial only if used during the first 10 days of infection. Read AlsoProcure anti-viral drug &amp; give to patients: Admin to hospsPune: Barring chemists from selling remdesivir directly to residents over-the-counter, divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao on Saturday said hospitals would be responsible for keeping the required stock and allocate the drug the according to the prescription of patients. “As of now, we have noDr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state Covid task force, said people should stop panic-buying the drug. “The rush for the drug is unfounded. It has restrictions on use and should be given only during the first nine days. It's a drug that only reduces viral replication in the body. It does not have the potential to reduce mortality. No study of the drug, worldwide, has shown an ability to reduce mortality,” Dr Joshi said. He added doctors may be prescribing the drug, which cuts hospital stay, to make more beds immediately available for more Covid patients. A senior doctor, another member of the state Covid advisory group, said favipiravir is the only other antiviral being recommended besides remdesivir. However, favipiravir has better impact if administered during the first five to six days of Covid onset. Research shows favipiravir was first used against SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan. Then, as the pandemic spread through Europe, the drug was given emergency use approvals in Italy, Japan, Russia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Moldova and Kazakhstan. In June last year, the Drugs Controller General of India okayed favipiravir use in those with mild to moderate Covid-19. Dr Ajay Godse, a chest specialist with the Bhaktivedanta Hospital in Thane said remdesivir worked in almost 95% of patients. But he said it should not be considered a “miracle drug” . “Prolonged viremia, which means longer presence of the virus in the body, requires medication in the form of antivirals. We found that remdesivir worked in our patients. It's a good drug, but people should not pin their hopes on it,” Dr Godse said. He added that they had used favipiravir in May last year, because it was an oral medicine and showed early promise. However, they found it to be weaker compared to remdesivir and useful only if used within the first five to six days of infection. “And considering its impact on kidney functioning and uric acid generation in the body, we have not used it since,” Dr Godse said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/remdesivir-has-no-impact-on-covid-mortality-dont-panic-buy-doctors/articleshow/82009893.cms||Swatee Kher

The IMD has issued a ‘yellow alert’ for Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara and Solapur districts for five days till April 14. Isolated places in the region started witnessing rainfall, thunderstorm and lightning from Friday night. At some places in the ghat sections of Kolhapur and Satara districts, the wind speed was almost 30 km per hour. This led to damage to the kutcha houses and some crops. There was a hailstorm in some places in Sangli district for some time. Most parts of Sangli district witnessed power cuts mainly due to uprooting of the poles and damage to the overhead wires. No major crop damage was reported here. However, in Sangli district, the grape growing farmers are worried. The grape harvesting season is ending and the traders are quoting very low prices for their produce. Shubhangi Bhute, a scientist at the regional Met department in Mumbai, said, “The change in weather is visible. It is mainly due to the north-south low pressure air trough developed across Maharashtra. Some places may witness high speed winds, reaching upto 40 km per hour. Those working outside, especially farmers, must take care.” The untimely rainfall has bought relief to citizens reeling under scorching heat. While people remained indoors on Saturday, the first day of weekend lockdown, the citizens felt at ease due to the dip in temperature. The maximum temperature across the region came down to 34-36 degrees celsius while the minimum temperature was 19-17 degrees celsius.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/rain-likely-in-south-maha-till-april-14/articleshow/82010279.cms||---

According to a report by the state groundwater department, 80% of the monitoring wells showed a falling trend in November 2020 compared to the previous year. The report points out that 81 % of observation dug wells, 84 % of bore wells and 72% of tube wells recorded a falling trend compared to the previous year which had recorded a slight rise in levels. The report is based on the monthly recordings of selected wells in the state. The main recordings were conducted during the pre-monsoon period in April and the post-monsoon period in November. While on paper, the state did not record high monsoon deficiency, it did not see the trend of heavy rains in June and July. Moreover, the rains tapered off off in August and September. In 2020, several locations recorded deficient rainfall in June till mid-July. Cyclonic storms in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea disturbed the track of the monsoon causing extreme rainfall events. The southwest monsoon extended as late into October and Northeast monsoon continued into November. There was intense rainfall in some days and no rainfall in many other days. The report said that most of the observation wells in the state showed a decline in water level during November 2020 compared to the previous year due to the deficiency in rainfall during northeast monsoon season. During NE monsoon season 2020, the rainfall in the state was deficient by 26%. Comparison of groundwater level in November 2020 with respect to the 10-year mean also revealed that 52 % of observation dug wells, 62 % of bore wells and 45% of tube wells recorded a falling trend. Majority of the observation dug wells and tube wells show decline in water level less than 0.5m. Apart from the state groundwater department, the central groundwater board also has been monitoring wells to record its status in the state. Every year, the CGWB also submits a report to the state government alerting it on the status of water levels as a preparation for summer scarcity. According to a reply given minister of state Rattan Lal Kataria in Rajya Sabha in March this year, of the total number of 1,334 wells monitored by the central groundwater board, 767 wells recorded a decline in water level while 567 registered a rise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/groundwater-level-shows-falling-trend/articleshow/82009911.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

If the state gets the approval, TN will add 1,650 seats to the undergraduate seat matrix, taking the tally to 5,200 seats in government medical colleges. On Saturday, director of medical education Dr R Narayanababu said that the state is expecting an inspection committee from NMC, the apex medical body regulating medical education, to visit these colleges in the next few weeks. As part of the mission to increase the number of medical colleges across the country, the Centre had granted permission to Tamil Nadu to launch 11 new medical colleges in the districts of Ramanathapuram, Virudhunagar, Dindigul, The Nilgiris, Ariyalur, Nagapattinam, Kallakurichi, Tiruvallur, Tirupur, Namakkal and Krishnagiri. “We are confident of getting its nod for all colleges because we have fulfilled all requirements,” Narayanababu said.The construction of the academic blocks has been nearly completed. “Though the NMC demands only a 350-bed hospital, we have a functioning 700-750 bed hospital in each of these colleges. Deans, doctors and faculty have joined duty. We now have the Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University affiliation for all colleges,” Narayanababu said. The anatomy, physiology and biochemistry labs, library, hostels — required for first year students — have been completed. “Some minor civil work such as electrical lines and plumbing is being carried out now. It will be completed soon,” he said. Tamil Nadu has allotted Rs 2,470.93 crore in the 2021 interim budget for these colleges. With this, most districts in the state will have at least one government medical college. Besides increasing the number of seats, these colleges would help expand tertiary care to districts. “By establishing medical colleges, we will now be able to provide quality medical training at affordable cost and offer speciality and super speciality care to people living in these areas free of cost,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/1-1-new-tn-med-colleges-await-nmc-inspection/articleshow/82009898.cms||---

A day after a similar assurance to Nepal, the government conveyed to Sri Lanka that India’s vaccine manufacturing capacity – already the largest in the world – is being enhanced to meet the emergency global demand of duly approved Covid-19 vaccines. “Their ongoing supply is calibrated in view of several factors, which include production and domestic requirement,” said the Indian high commission in Sri Lanka in a statement. The Lankan vaccination programme had to be stopped earlier after a delay in fresh supplies from India. “India will continue to be in the forefront of the global fight against the Covid-19 pandemic and will also continue its valuable cooperation with relevant stakeholders,” added the Indian mission in its statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-assures-neighbours-on-vax-supplies/articleshow/82011217.cms||---

A senior south corporation official said the move came after Delhi High Court upheld the civic body’s termination notice issued to the old contractor. “After facing issues with the old contractor regarding default in payment, we terminated the contract. The contractor then pursued the court, but on Friday the court dismissed the application. Later, we signed a handing over letter in which the old concessionaire has permitted transferring of toll tax collection rights to the new one,” said the official. “In compliance with letter of award dated April 9, the possession of 124 toll plazas along with land/site/equipment/asset have been handed over to Sahakar Global Ltd-JV by MEP Infrastructure Developer Ltd. for collection of toll tax and environment compensation charges from specified commercial vehicles entering Delhi with effect from April 10 (6am),” stated the letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-brings-in-new-pvt-contractor-to-collect-toll/articleshow/82010284.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Powerless but not helpless, street kids shine in exams||NEW DELHI: Despite braving odds, Anju, a 12-year-old girl living in the narrow lanes of Anand Vihar basti, scored the first position in her class of 61 children this year. She stays in a single-room rented shanty with six siblings and her parents, who keep asking her to quit studies. “My father beats me up and asks me to work as a full-time household help with my mother, but I refuse to listen to him. I don’t want to live a life in shanties. Everything is tough here. My mother supports me sometimes, but there’s not much she can do to convince my father. I had never scored the first rank, but when I got my report card this time, my father was the first person I showed it to. For the first time, he smiled looking at my grades and said that I should keep it up. That made me very happy,” said Anju. Recalling how the last year was especially tough for her, the 12-year-old girl said, “Earlier, I used to go to school, so things were not as hard till the lockdown was announced. My father lost his job and stayed at home for six months. While he was at home, he wouldn’t let me open any books. This made me lag behind in my studies. I didn’t even have a phone to attend online classes.” Beating all odds, she and her friend, who stays in the same JJ cluster, grabbed the first and second positions in their respective classes. Her friend, Isha (11), has always been a bright student. Proudly showing her report card, her mother said, “My daughter scored the second position, even while helping me make money to sustain the family.” “We don’t have a smartphone. I missed out on a lot during online classes. The teachers knew our problem, so didn’t say anything. But I didn’t let this hamper my spirit and kept studying. This helped me earn the second position in my class,” said a beaming Isha. Kishan, who also bagged the first position in his class of 55 students, said there was no electricity at his house. “When we stopped going to school, I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to do well like the previous years. I wasn’t expecting this result, but am glad I could score well without attending online classes,” he added. “I want to become a teacher and educate those who are poor like me and cannot attend classes. It’s unfortunate that the poor are neglected and get no help. My relatives who have smartphones didn’t help me when I needed it the most. My result is a slap on their faces,” said Umesh Kumar, a street kid who works part time at a shop earning Rs 6,000 per month. Sanjay Gupta, director of NGO Chetna, said, “We admitted more than 700 street children in government schools with the help of Toybox charity. The source of income of their families ranged from being daily wagers, contractual labourers, ragpicking, begging, domestic workers or street vendors. Children from these communities have been the worst affected by the pandemic. Despite this, many have scored the highest marks in their classes.” “I used to get worksheets while attending classes, but my parents took me to our village in Bihar when the lockdown was announced. I couldn’t do anything there and lost a lot of my academic year. I insisted on coming back so that I could at least fill the worksheets. I studied hard for two months and scored the highest marks in my class,” said Bhavya, another topper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/powerless-but-not-helpless-street-kids-shine-in-exams/articleshow/82022151.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

After staging dharna for over an hour, the doctors resumed work after police assured security at the state-run hospital campus. The doctors gathered outside the medical superintendent’s office after an alleged argument between a patient's relative and a resident doctor at the Covid-19 hospital where a patient had died on Saturday. A few relatives of the deceased entered the hospital building and soon entered into a heated argument and a tense situation was created, said sources in NCH. “The relatives were angry and some of them even tried to attack the doctor. We have been demanding security at the Covid-19 hospital but no arrangements have been done till now,” said one of the protesting doctors. “Following the incident we sat on dharna after which police assured us security. They told the doctors that two cops will be placed at each of the two gates,” said a doctor.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Covid +ve patients roam hospitals, labs freely||HYDERABAD: With absolutely no enforcement of the mandatory quarantine rule, many Covid positive patients are roaming about freely, walking into hospitals and diagnostic centres despite knowing their Covid positive status. In the process, they are exposing many others to the virus. In one incident, a Covid positive patient, who had recently visited a diagnostic centre, waited for nearly two hours to get a HR-CT test done to find out how badly his lungs were affected. Worse, many of these patients take cabs and autos to visit the hospital, clinic or diagnostic centre exposing drivers to the virus as well. “We had this walk-in patient a few days ago who came for an RT-PCR test. The next day he came to collect his report and when he was told he was positive, he said he already knew it and he was repeating the test here just for confirmation. He had stood in the queue for nearly an hour to give his sample,” said an official at a diagnostic chain in the city. In another case, a husband took his wife’s Covid report to show it to the doctor, even though he was positive himself and asymptomatic. Experts say the spread is going to be very difficult to tame as monitoring of many patients in home isolation is not possible. “While it is advisable for an asymptomatic positive patient to be in home isolation, it is not possible for any department to keep tab on so many patients. If the patient needs any diagnostic tests, they should be taken in an ambulance equipped for transferring Covid patients. The best way is to keep them in a hospital and get the tests done, as labs will have a lot of other patients who will be exposed to the virus if a Covid positive patient goes,” said Dr Sanjeev Singh Yadav, national secretary for Indian Medical Association’s Academy of Medical Specialities. “The dread of the virus is largely over among people, and with it, the seriousness of following the quarantine rule. The government now has to focus on healthcare infrastructure,” said professor Subodh Kandamuthan, Director, Centre for Healthcare Management, ASCI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-ve-patients-roam-hosps-labs-freely/articleshow/82010283.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Chennai||Chennai students enrolled in courses abroad stuck due to travel ban||CHENNAI: City students with offer letters from universities in Australia are unable to travel because of the Covid-triggered ban on foreign students. Similar is the situation for those admitted to institutions in Japan and China. Many have been appealing on social media and have signed online petitions under the hashtag justiceforinternationalstudents urging governments to speed up opening of borders. Students across the country have been affected. While a few in Delhi have protested, those in Chennai are looking for options in universities in the UK and Canada. The universities concerned are offering online classes, but few prefer them because of the cost and because they don’t offer the on-campus experience. Most of the affected are those planning masters’ courses in computer science, IT, electronics and architecture. M Aquib, an architecture student who will have to defer his plans to join a masters’ course in Australia for the fourth time, said he had been waiting for more than a year and planned to switch to the UK if he misses a chance again. “Online classes are not preferred because they offer a discount of only $3,000 to $4,000, which is not much when compared to the total fees,” he said, adding that few would want to spend and miss the experience of campus life. Still, at least 30 TN students have opted for online education in Australia. R Suresh Kumar of Trumatics, an overseas education consultant, said most students from Chennai opt for Australia. “These students are now trying to look at other countries because they have been waiting for more than a year. Many ask for the UK and Canada because the cost of education is not expensive like in Australia. They have also started to allow students to do internships and work.” Bala Ramlingam of BEC Global said students are waiting for the border to open by year-end. “They are appealing but the government has to decide on opening the border. Australia may open for existing students but the new students may have to study online.” “We do not encourage our students to travel. It is tough to go there,” he said. The condition of students studying medicine in China is worse. “I am an internship student. I do not have online classes so I have lost 13 months. Losing two more years is stressful. Some seniors who just have only four months left are also stuck,” said a student who did not wish to be named.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/students-enrolled-in-courses-abroad-stuck-due-to-travel-ban/articleshow/82009931.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Why didn’t central forces on poll duty carry non-lethal weapons, ask experts||Kolkata: Experts have questioned the absence of adequate non-lethal weapons with the central forces who are now tasked to do law-and-order duty in Bengal. Former IPS officer Barun Mullick questioned why the central force, when deployed on poll duty, didn’t carry non-lethal weapons, for if they resort to firing it will hurt people. A senior CISF official in Kolkata said every CISF personnel undergoes stringent law-and-order training before being inducted into the force. “Unlike other central forces, CISF is specifically trained to handle law-and-order situations as they are posted in places that have a high civilian flow. CISF personnel can shoot for self-defence. Even action or motion by someone that may be intended to hurt a CISF personnel can allow him to act under self-defence. But the burden of proof would be on the man with the gun. He needs to prove the veracity of the attack under which he was forced to shoot,” said the official. The official, however, added that even in self-defence, shooting a person is the last option. “During mob control, the personnel should first burst smoke bombs and tear gas shells, water cannons and resort to lathi-charge. In case they need to open fire, they should first shoot in air before shooting at someone,” he said. A senior IPS officer pointed out that the CISF staff normally carry SLR, and the inspectors carry revolvers. The officer also questioned why the state police, which reached to their help, didn’t resort to non-lethal means. Debasish Dhar, the Cooch Behar SP, has been a commanding officer with the state armed police. Before that, he worked for the CBI. Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra also raised the issue of not using non-lethal weapons. She said: “Does CAPF need to shoot to kill during a democratic election? Why not use rubber bullets like the rest of the civilised world? The Election Commission needs to answer.” Former IPS officer Nazrul Islam said: “CISF personnel, despite their training, are not often exposed to crowd-control duties and may feel threatened seeing a crowd approaching them. This may have prompted them to open fire quickly.” Islam argued that lathi-charge – in such cases – should always have been the first option. “If policemen use lathis crowd can be easily dispersed. Normally, an order from the magistrate or superior officers are needed for firing. But if it is in self-defence then no such order is required,” he explained. Another ex-IPS officer Pankaj Dutta felt it was not ideal to comment on central forces before the actual sequence of events is known.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/why-didnt-central-forces-on-poll-duty-carry-non-lethal-weapons-ask-experts/articleshow/82009558.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Of the remaining 553 children, 419 (76%) started working after the lockdown. Most of them are working for more than eight hours and some for 12 hours,” he said. “Their wages are between Rs 100 and Rs 400 per day. Most of them started working because of the financial distressed caused by the lockdown. The survey showed that child labour has increased by three-fold in the state following the pandemic. It is important to identify and put the children back in schools,” Karuppusamy added.The organization urged the government to create more employment opportunities in the state and to increase wages under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) apart from ensuring that the benefits of the social welfare schemes reach them. It also urged the government to strictly implement labour and child-labour laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/bring-child-labourers-back-to-school-ngo-tells-govt/articleshow/82009557.cms||Nivedha Selvam

Before they could normalise operations, price of raw materials started to increase. In this situation, if the government asks us to subject our employees to RT-PCR test once in 15 days, how will we survive?” asked J James, coordinator of Federation of Coimbatore Industrial Association (Focia).“RT-PCR test costs Rs 1,500 per person. Think about the industries that are employing 10 to 15 people. How could they afford to shell out such a huge amount every month? Even attempting it would put our livelihood at stake,” he told TOI.Steel price has gone up from Rs 68 to Rs 75 in a month, said R Surendran, an industrialist. “With GST, it comes around Rs 92. We are struggling because of this. We are also staring at labour shortage, which is bringing down productivity. We would be further burdened if we sponsor Covid test for employees.”The district administration should conduct free camps in industrial areas to test workers, industrialist said and expressed willingness to follow government guidelines to contain virus spread.

The traders in Kolhapur city, defying the day-time prohibitory orders, had kept their businesses open on the first day of the ‘Break the Chain’ initiative (April 5). However, the next day, they had downed their shutters, hoping that the government will allow the shops to function on all days — barring the weekends — till April 30. The KCCI representatives said the traders’ associations had held talks even at the chief ministerial level, but had not got a favourable response. KCCI president Sanjay Shete said: “Since the meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray two days ago, we have heard of no development in this regard. Our associations want the traders to be allowed to operate by following all Covid-related rules. We have now decided to keep the shops open in Kolhapur city from Monday. However, we will ensure that the customers wear masks and maintain physical distance. Also, our eligible staff will get the vaccines.” Shete said the shops will be open from 7 am to 8 pm every weekday. He warned that if the authorities tried to shut the shops, then all shops — including the shops dealing in essentials items such as medicines, milk, which were exempted from the restriction — will be shut in protest. “All our associations across the state have arrived at the conclusion that there should be no further talks with the government until the government accepts their demands. During the weekend lockdown, we will cooperate with the authorities by keeping the shops closed. But we will defy the authorities on other days,” said Shete.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-traders-to-open-all-shops-from-monday/articleshow/82010287.cms||---

City crematoriums equipped with gas furnaces are being used for cremation round the clock. As a result, the iron frames on which the bodies are placed inside the gas furnace has started melting at all crematoriums. Gas furnaces at all three crematoriums of Diamond City are facing the melting issue. A similar issue has also come up in neighbouring Bardoli town.Along with the melting of frames, the burners also require frequent maintenance as they are being used round the clock. “Earlier we used to cremate 20 bodies in a day of which few were cremated on a wood pyre while others were cremated in gas furnaces. The load was limited and each furnace got enough time to cool down. But now, we are handling over 80 bodies daily and each furnace is in use round the clock. Hence the iron frames have started melting and breaking,” said an official at Ramnath Ghela Crematorium (RGC). At Ashwini Kumar Crematorium (AKC) too currently two furnaces are not working. “The frames are melting and gas burners get clogged. As the furnaces are in constant use, we are facing this difficulty,” said an official at AKC. Kurukshetra Crematorium (KC) has employed a team of technicians for frequent maintenance of the gas furnaces. “We have employed a team which is available round the clock to repair the furnace. Due to 24 hours use the furnaces break down many times,” said an official at KC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/gas-furnaces-grills-melt-as-cremations-continue-24x7/articleshow/82008914.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

While BJP’s Babul Supriyo chose to hit the turf — challenging “fake women voters” and even “punishing’ one of them by asking her to apologize in front of a dozen cameras — Trinamool’s Aroop Biswas mostly stayed put with his close aides, rarely answering to calls and appearing in public, choosing to marshal his troops from his residence at New Alipore and his office. Babul, who set out early in the morning from The Tollygunge Club in his SUV, chose to stay close to Golf Green and Bijoygarh before moving towards Garia. It was a call from a polling agent at the Niva Ananda Vidyalaya close to Battala Bazar in Bansdroni that made him rush there around 10.15am. “I was told that an elderly woman was trying to cast a fake vote. When my agent objected, Trinamool polling agents and supporters brought him out of the room and threatened to kidnap his son. I have come here to pacify him,” he said. The drama, though, had just begun. Once inside, Babul claimed he came across an elderly female voter who was carrying a dubious ID card. “The ID card bore the name of the mother of a local syndicate member and an extortionist who has close links with Trinamool. His mother had passed away some time ago. It was clear the woman was a bogus voter. At this point, the woman fell on my knees and said she was to be forgiven. I realized that while the woman knew what she was doing was wrong, she had been coerced into it. I brought her out of the booth when three female Trinamool supporters surrounded me and claimed I was trying to influence voters. They tried snatching away the ID card. But I held on to it. As the media surrounded them, they ran away. I made her say sorry,” he said. The local Trinamool leadership challenged Babul’s version. “If things were as Babul claims, why did he not lodge a complaint?”asked a former councillor. With the matter at Battala taken care of, Babul chose to stick to areas where Trinamool is known to take leads — Sonali Park, Dinesh Nagar and Boral. A little after noon, Babul was ready to congratulate the EC and central forces for holding peaceful elections. That was before he had rushed to St Clare’s School, Ananda Pally Unnayan Samity and Sanskrit Manch in ward 114 after claims of ruling party rigging. When reminded of the Cooch Behar deaths, he said, “Any death is unfortunate. But I will not comment till I get all the details,” he said. Is he confident of a win? “Of course, yes,” he smiled. Biswas, his aides insisted, is not unduly worried. “Dada need not be out on a single day. He is in contact with his voters all 365 days,” said one of them. At his residence at New Alipore, there was an uncanny silence. Not many were even found lingering outside. The Pallisree party office — otherwise bubbling with activity — remained deserted for most of the day. “You will get all your answers on May 2, “ his aide stated. CPM candidate Debdut Ghosh said he was happy with how the day progressed. “Tollygunge could celebrate democracy and at least we have not found any major issues. The youth — who matter a lot in this election — came out and voted in large numbers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/minister-vs-minister-babul-visits-polling-booths-aroop-marshals-troops-from-home/articleshow/82009569.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

With this, the tally has touched 62,575.The number of active Covid cases shot up to 3,677 on the day, forcing the district administration to open Covid care centres at Codissia trade fair complex and Bharathiar University.While 217 patients were discharged from treatment centres in the district, the health bulletin didn’t report any Covid death on the day.The district has increased the daily testing of samples to 6,500. Hence, the positivity rate now stands at around 6.5%.The health department has, meanwhile, allowed all frontline workers to get vaccinated, after repeated requests from the revenue, police and healthcare workers younger than 45. A week ago, the state government had announced that only people aged above 45 years could get vaccinated. Now, all the healthcare and frontline workers younger than 45 could get vaccinated after signing a self-declaration form and an employment proof form.On April 1, when the Union government announced vaccination for people above 45, the state government had instructed all districts to vaccinate only that specific age group, as there was an acute shortage of vaccine. An official said, “The rule applied for all the healthcare and frontline workers too. The government felt that the time window for them was over by February-end. During the election, we prioritized all government officials on election duty, but compliance was low.”He said in the wake of the second wave they were getting repeated requests from certain government departments to get all their staff vaccinated. “So, the government has relented.”The district had received 1,23,000 vaccine doses - 1,06,000 does of Covishield and 17,000 doses of Covaxin - on Thursday. After distributing to all the government hospitals, primary health centres and private hospitals, the district has a stock of 32,000 doses. “This should last for around 10 days. Private hospitals can show us their seven-day performance to get their stocks replenished,” another official said.Media people across all ages could get vaccinated under the category of “others”. Meanwhile, collector S Nagarajan got his second shot of Covaxin at the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital on the day.Police have formed 15 flying squad action teams to check if people are following Covid-19 precautions like wearing masks and maintaining social distancing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/501-fresh-covid-19-cases-in-district-take-tally-to-62575/articleshow/82009566.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Candidates allege attacks in fourth phase||Kolkata: Violence on the poll day continued unabated even during the fourth phase of the elections in the state. Candidates across the state alleged attacks on them amid claims and counter-claims over the violence. Two-time Dinhata MLA Udayan Guha was allegedly attacked by BJP supporters on Saturday. “I was attacked in the presence of the central force and none of them came to my help. They had seen me entering the booth and talking to the presiding officer,” Guha said. He was allegedly mobbed while he was coming out of a booth (no 230) in the Bhataguri area. Some men chanting “Jay Shree Ram’’ chased his car and pelted stones. The windscreen of his car was smashed by a wooden pole. A media vehicle following the leader was also attacked. Guha later stopped a police car, sought help and demanded immediate action. In Hooghly, BJP leader Locket Chatterjee’s car was attacked by some locals. Men carrying black flags mobbed her black sedan. Visuals captured by the media and later shared on social media showed something coming from inside the car and smashing the right window. A brick piece was also seen on the seat. “I want people to see this and take steps to make Bengal violence free,” she said. Locket alleged that the rage was a result of her trying to stop rigging attempts at booth 66. Some of the media cars were also damaged. “We don’t want to comment on the attack as the video clearly shows that the window was broken from inside,” Trinamool leader Dola Sen said. BJP candidate from Behala Payel Sarkar’s car was vandalised allegedly by Trinamool supporters while she was visiting booths in the area. She alleged that a group of bikers chased her car near the Mandirbazar area and smashed the rear window. While she did not name any one specifically, Sarkar pointed fingers at Trinamool supporters. Vaishali Dalmiya, the BJP candidate from Bally, was also attacked and a car in her convoy was vandalized, allegedly by Trinamool workers. While she was visiting booths at Lilua, a group of men followed her convoy and smashed windows of the last car in the convoy. The driver of the vehicle was hurt. Local Trinamool leaders pointed fingers at the inner clash of BJP. At Bandel, Trinamool and BJP workers had a heated exchange of words. Central force and police reached the spot and managed to disperse the crowd.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/candidates-allege-attacks-in-fourth-phase/articleshow/82009564.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Hyderabad||Don’t fleece Covid patients, Telangana tells hospitals||HYDERABAD: Telangana health minister Eatala Rajender has warned private super speciality hospitals and other health facilities of stern action if they charge more than the fees prescribed by the state government or deny treatment and insist on payment. The warning came after allegations that some private hospitals were charging exorbitant fees from Covid-19 patients, just like they did in the first wave of the pandemic. “We have asked hospital managements to treat patients on humanitarian grounds and not look into the commercial side. These hospitals have a responsibility in this pandemic and they should not shirk from it,” Rajender said on Saturday after holding a meeting with corporate hospitals, medical colleges, private nursing homes and National Accreditation for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH) hospital managements. He said people can complain to the government or the task force committee, which was constituted earlier to look into such complaints and action would be taken, although hospital managements have assured to cooperate with the government. The minister blamed the surge in Covid cases to Telangana sharing a long border with Maharashtra, Karnataka and Chhattisgarh, where there has been a substantial jump in cases and many from neighbouring states are coming to Hyderabad for treatment. Though cases are on the rise, the Telangana government has no intention of imposing another lockdown or curfew in the state, the minister added. “Self- regulation is more important and people should wear masks and follow guidelines of the Centre and state government,” he said. “Earlier Covid-19 patients had severe complications, but in the second wave though the number of cases is increasing rapidly, complications are less. Now, 97% patients do not have symptoms and the mortality rate is also about 0.56%,” he said. He also asked people not to panic and said all government hospitals were ready to provide treatment free of cost. “About 14,000 beds are available in private medical colleges and hospitals where government is providing medicines, test kits and other material. They have to provide only manpower for treating the patients,” he said. “Prices of RT-PCR test and medicines such as Remdisivir have come down. While testing is free at government hospitals, 60 private hospitals have been given permission for conducting tests,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dont-fleece-covid-patients-t-tells-hospitals/articleshow/82010306.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Kolkata||Modi ‘whisperer’ in viral photo just wanted a selfie||KOLKATA: A photograph of a man in a skull cap whispering something into Narendra Modi’s ears recently went viral, triggering a flurry of memes on social media over the past week and even prompting AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi to mock the PM at a public meeting. Who was this mystery man and what had he said? TOI tracked down 38-year-old BJP worker Zulfiqar Ali, a Garden Reach resident, busy with “booth duties” at Metiabruz on Saturday. “I had only asked for Modiji’s permission for a selfie with him. He had gladly agreed. He rested his arm around my shoulder and asked a photographer accompanying him to click. I will cherish those 40 seconds spent with him forever,” said Ali, visibly basking in the glory the viral photograph had offered him. Speaking to TOI outside Metiabruz police station, Ali said he had been associated with the BJP since 2014 and was currently president of the party’s minority morcha in south Kolkata. On Saturday, the fourth phase of polling in Bengal, he was busy monitoring volunteers outside multiple booths in Behala, Tollygunge and Kasba. Ali said the photograph was clicked on April 2 at Sonarpur helipad after Modi finished his public meeting. “I was among six persons selected to see him off at the helipad. I was the last among the six to bid adieu and when Modiji came near me, I whispered into his ears that I wished to click a picture with him. He did ask a photographer, but a selfie was never taken. Over the next few hours, I received several calls and realised my photo with the PM had gone viral.” The BJP worker said when curious friends and family members ask him what he had whispered into the PM’s ears, he feels he had missed an opportunity. “I always wanted to serve the nation by joining the Army. I wish I had told Modiji that,” said the Class X dropout. Once an active Congress worker, Ali claims he was the target of the 2013 attack outside Harimohan Ghosh College in Kidderpore, allegedly by TMC goons, when he was saved by Kolkata Police officer Tapas Chowdhury, who took the bullet. “I left Congress in disgust and joined BJP the next year,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/modi-whisperer-in-viral-photo-just-wanted-a-selfie/articleshow/82009576.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: ‘How can we be specialists if we’re on Covid-19 duty ’||Resident doctors had withdrawn their services in Nair Medical College, Mumbai. They also gave an ultimatum at IGGMCH Nagpur. Protests like these in the middle of the pandemic made people panicky and angry as well. However, Dr Dnyaneshwar Dhobale Patil, president of the central committee of the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD), says problems faced by his fraternity are genuine. Hailing from a small town in Washim district, the alumnus of GMCH, Nagpur, spoke to TOI about various issues.Excerpts from an interview... Q. Why did resident doctors threaten to withdraw their services in the middle of pandemic? A. Resident doctors are medical postgraduate trainees. Technically, we are MBBS doctors, but we are here in medical colleges as PG students. Residents in Maharashtra under the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) have been working tirelessly since the past one year in the war against Covid-19. Since it is a pandemic, we worked hard during its peak in September 2020 and dedicated nearly half of our training period towards this cause. These were extenuating circumstances. We have tried to fulfil our responsibilities as doctors to the best of our abilities but it should not be forgotten that we are students. We had threatened to withdraw our services because we are facing severe academic losses. Q. As PG doctors, you are getting on-the-job training in the Covid-19 period too. So, what exactly do you need? A. All resident doctors irrespective of their specialties have been working in Covid wards instead of their own departments. We are here to be trained as specialist doctors in various fields. This training is now being irreversibly hampered due to repeated shifts in Covid-19 wards. We have a training period of 3 years to become a competent specialist doctor. More than one third of that time has been spent working in Covid wards. If this continues then we won’t have the necessary skills and competency needed by the end of our training period. We are supposed to be here to be trained in our respective fields but we are being shunted to fill the gaps in our public health system. Q. How will it affect services and the healthcare system at large? A. Resident doctors are being used as a stopgap solution and have been shouldering the burden of Covid-19 by doing every minute thing related to patient care. This work is supposed to be done by doctors employed by the public health department and not by students. This is a tremendous waste of human resources and is a ticking time bomb as this decision will lead to a generation of inadequately trained ‘specialist doctors’ and will leave our healthcare system in a far worse state than it is at present. Q. But why did you raise issues in the middle of the second wave? A. After almost a year into the pandemic, we hope our government is better equipped to handle the challenges. Instead of turning GMCs into dedicated Covid hospitals, government hospitals should have been developed in a year. Our GMCs which are tertiary care centers, should be used for patients that actually need specialist care. Resident doctors are being forced to work as general practitioners which is detrimental to all parties involved — trainee doctors, patients and the limited healthcare facilities that we have. This was the best time to raise issues or we would have lost everything. Q. What is the way out if residents are spared? A. Doctors employed by the public health department could take over day-to-day patient care, while resident doctors can be given supervisory roles. The administration has comfortably and conveniently ignored the well-being of resident doctors. Initially, only resident doctors were recruited for Covid services. Only when the patient load increased, medical officers were appointed. As soon as the situation was brought under control, medical officers were relieved of Covid duty instead of relieving residents so that they could continue with their academics. We are facing bureaucratic hurdles too as we are not getting any relief at the academic level. Q. What kind of relaxations are you expecting from the government? A. Resident doctors who have been at the frontline against in the pandemic have received no exemption with regard to the fees to be paid for the academic year. This was the year in which our academics suffered at the cost of Covid duties. No exemption has been provided for thesis submission too which is grossly unfair. Our tertiary care centre was converted into a dedicated Covid care centre which further reduced the flow of patients. The patient who comes here for treatment also suffers. Most of the resources are diverted to Covid wards leaving general wards without bare necessities and medication. Q. What are your demands and are they being fulfilled? A. As of now, we have only received assurances. Residents in IGGMCH Nagpur have received assurance from the guardian minister. GMCH Nagpur and Akola residents have also got the same assurance from their respective authorities. Most of them have agreed not to use GMCs as dedicated Covid hospitals once this second wave recedes. Discussions pertaining to Latur GMCH and some other colleges are under way. Ultimately, we don’t want patients to suffer. Even when we had threatened to withdraw services, we had assured that we would serve in both Covid and non-Covid ICUs. We don’t want to trouble patients. But this is a question of our life-and-death, our careers, future of doctors and eventually future of patients. We appeal to the state government to resolve issues of resident doctors and take favourable decisions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/how-can-we-be-specialists-if-were-on-covid-19-duty-/articleshow/82008955.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Meerut||'If a chaiwala can be PM, then why can't chaiwali be pradhan'||Muzaffarnagar: Largely inspired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's political journey, a 35-year-old woman tea-seller in Uttar Pradesh has decided to take the plunge and contest for the village pradhan's post in this month's state panchayat elections. Meenakshi Devi, who has been selling tea for three years at Morna block under Bhopa police station area of Muzaffarnagar district, filed her nomination papers on Saturday. She is a graduate from Meerut University and her husband, Gyan Singh, is a local labourer. Using her profession as a poll plank, the mother of three young children said, "PM Modi used to sell tea as well. If a 'chaiwala' can become a PM, then why can't a 'chaiwali' become a pradhan?" Meenakshi was provided a tea stall under the National Rural Livelihood Mission scheme. And she now plans to contest from her village, Chorawala, a reserved SC seat with around 7,000 voters. Her husband claims that following "widespread support from villagers", she decided to file her nomination. She has not been propped up by any political party, he quickly added. "In 2015, villagers elected my wife as a gram panchayat member. Now, villagers told my wife that if Modi ji, who used to sell tea, can become a PM, then she can at least contest for the village pradhan's post," Gyan Singh said. Confident of a win on May 2, the Chorawala 'chaiwali' said that she will "bring fast-paced development in her village".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/if-a-chaiwala-can-be-pm-then-why-cant-chaiwali-be-pradhan/articleshow/82008963.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Nagpur||Schools allege harassment for payment of ‘non-agricultural’ tax||Nagpur: Schools in some parts of Maharashtra have expressed shocked over being asked to cough up “non-agricultural tax” by local authorities. Their cause is being taken up by Unaided Schools Forum (USF), an association of over thousand private unaided schools, which says demand for such a tax is illegal. In a letter to Maharashtra’s revenue minister, USF has asked that a letter be sent to all district officials making them aware that schools are not liable to pay non-agricultural tax. Subhash Chandra Kedia, honorary secretary of USF said, “Non-agricultural tax is not payable by educational institutions due to exemption u/s 117 of The Maharashtra Land Revenue Code. That section clearly exempts ‘lands used for an educational or a charitable purpose the benefit of which is open to all citizens without distinction of religion, race, caste, place of birth or any of them’.” Kedia added that even the courts had held a similar view. “The Bombay High Court, in writ petition No.376 of 1984 also held that educational institutions are exempted from the payment of non-agricultural tax u/s 117 of The Maharashtra Land Revenue Code 1966. Our schools have brought these facts to the notice of the collectors, tehsildars and talathis but they are not considering the same and asking the schools to produce the exemption letter from collector. They are threatening that they will attach the property of the school if non-agricultural tax is not paid,” said Kedia. In its letter to state revenue minister, USF alleged that local officials are blackmailing schools for this. “We regret to bring to your kind notice that we have never seen such rampant corruption in the revenue department and never heard that these corrupt officers will harass the educational institutions which are the pillars of growth to our nation” the letter stated.  Kedia said if the government fails to take action against local officials, then their association will initial legal action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/schools-allege-harassment-for-payment-of-non-agricultural-tax/articleshow/82018943.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Ahmedabad||New peak: 5,000 daily cases in Gujarat, 1,400 in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: It was tenth consecutive peak for the state as Gujarat for the first time recorded over 5,000 daily cases of Covid-19 positive patients at 5,011 in 24 hours ending 5pm on Saturday. It was 78% rise in daily cases in a matter of seven days and 10% daily surge. Ahmedabad with 1,409 cases accounted for 28% of the state’s total daily cases and also recorded yet another daily high. The state had test positivity rate (TPR) of 3.4% whereas for Ahmedabad it was 5.2%. On May 5 last year, the state had recorded its highest ever daily death toll of 49. On Saturday, the figure returned to haunt the state again after 11 months. Analysis of the two dates however show the stark difference. On May 5, the deaths included 39 from Ahmedabad district, three from Vadodara and two from Surat. On Saturday, Ahmedabad and Surat districts accounted for 16 deaths each, followed by eight in Rajkot and four in Vadodara, showing more diverse mortality in the state. “This wave of the pandemic is crucial in terms of patient management and resource management – due to surge, the active cases in the state have for the first time crossed 25,000 mark. Even when we consider 50% of the patients requiring medical attention and 25% hospitalization, it still accounts to 12,500 and 6,250 respectively. Thus, we are witnessing shortage of everything ranging from testing kits to medicines and beds to oxygen,” said a city-based hospital administrator. On Saturday, the number of beds available in private hospitals in Ahmedabad crossed 5,000 mark at 5,048. Out of total, 4,307 were occupied, giving 85% occupancy. The occupancy of ventilators and ICU beds was 93% and 89% respectively. At Civil Hospital, 1,177 beds out of 1200 beds were occupied, whereas overall Medicity had 1,856 patients under treatment. Officials at Sola Civil Hospital were not available for comment. The state government on Saturday urged the communities and smaller nursing homes to make Covid Health Centres (CHC) and Covid Care Centres (CCC) with keeping requirements such as fire safety and parking in mind. While CHCs have oxygen supply and availability of a critical care specialist, at CCC, those with mild symptoms can be managed in isolation facilities to prevent spread.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/new-peak-5k-daily-cases-in-state-1400-in-city/articleshow/82010674.cms||---

In what initially looked liked a double murder turned out to be a murder-cum-suicide during police investigation. According to the police, a suicide note was also recovered from the youth, a B-Pharma graduate who was allegedly in an illicit relationship with the woman - married and mother of a 14-year-old boy. The duo lived in the same locality. During investigation, police claimed to have recovered a suicide note from the youth's trouser pocket and a voice note from his mobile was sent to his brother on WhatsApp alerting him about the extreme step he was taking. Elaborating, Meerut SP (Rural) Keshav Kumar said, "The YouTube and browser search history on the youth's phone showed that he was looking online for information on death by Sulphas poisoning." Interestingly, the pistol used by him in killing his paramour and later ending his life was recovered from his father who, according to police, had panicked and removed it from the crime scene. Though, prima facie, police claimed bullet injury was most likely the cause of death, it is yet to be ascertained through the findings of the postmortem report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/murder-cum-suicide-two-bodies-recovered-in-meerut/articleshow/82008989.cms||---
---||Delhi||Two women stabbed in separate incidents in Delhi||NEW DELHI: A 40-year-old woman was publicly stabbed to death in Rohini on Saturday by her husband who had suspected her of having an extramarital affair.  The same day, a 24-year-old man allegedly stabbed to death his stepmother in Rohini after she had refused to give him money. Both accused have been arrested. In the afternoon, police got a call from Budh Vihar that a man had attacked his wife with a knife and threatened locals when they tried to help her. When a police team reached the spot, Harish Mehta, who runs a marriage bureau, tried to flee but was caught. The woman, Neelu, was declared dead on arrival at a hospital. “As per CCTV footage, she was stabbed at least a dozen times,” police said. “Mehta told police that he recently got married and didn’t want his wife to continue with her job at Safdarjung Hospital. But she did not quit and he suspected her of having an extramarital affair, which often led to heated arguments between them,” police said. Neelu had been living with her parents for some time. “Around 2pm, Mehta took a knife and approached his wife,” police added. In the other incident in Sector 26, a 45-year-old woman was found dead in her house. Preliminary probe revealed Shakeela used to live with her two stepsons and her husband, Mohammad Murtaza, who runs a tyre repair shop, stayed with her three other step children in Bahadurgarh. Murtaza’s second wife lives in Bihar. Mohammad Mustafa (24) had reportedly demanded money from Shakeela, but she refused. In a fit of rage, Mustafa took a sharp object and stabbed her, said an officer. Deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Pranav Tayal said both cases were being probed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/two-women-stabbed-in-separate-incidents/articleshow/82009930.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Get you own remdesivir, say hospitals||AHMEDABAD: Scarcity of remdesivir which has been plaguing Covid-19 treatment for past few days got more acute on Saturday. It was reported that wary of the shortage, many hospitals were admitting patients with a precondition — if hospital is not able to manage remdesivir, patients’ relatives will have to manage the same! Sanket Shah, a Satellite resident, said that he had arranged four shots for himself and his father in past four days. “A private hospital admitted my father on the condition that if he needs remdesivir, they would not be able to arrange it, it would have to be procured by us,” he said. “Moreover, when I started my home quarantine with moderate symptoms as I could not secure a bed, I had approached a hospital for homecare package. The first condition they had was to get remdesivir – or else they would not be able to help.” Shah’s four family members are either hospitalized or home quarantined with Covid-19 infection. Meanwhile, the drying up of stocks left many in lurch. Vadodara resident Nirmit Gosai’s father-in-law is hospitalized with Covid-19 and prescribed remdesivir for lung infection. “I had all my hopes pinned on the Zydus Hospital’s medicine counter in Ahmedabad and came all the way from Vadodara on Saturday but learnt the hospital has shut distribution,” Gosai said. Zydus Hospital Group announced the non-availability of remdesivir injections at its Ahmedabad hospital late on Friday night. Several people hunting for remdesivir did not know about Zydus Hospital’s late-night announcement. They learnt of it only after reaching the hospital. Many like Gosai had come from other cities. “I came from Kalol because I needed four injections for my grandmother,” said Pragnesh Suthar, who too had reached Zydus Hospital on Saturday morning. “I called several stockists who asked for Rs 36,000 for six vials,” Suthar said. “How will I get so much money?”  Stockists said that with such erratic and inadequate supply, they cannot meet the growing demand for the drug. The majority of the stockists across Ahmedabad and Vadodara ran out of remdesivir by Saturday afternoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/get-you-own-remdesivir-hospitals/articleshow/82010672.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Kolkata||In a corner of Kolkata, polling gets a Chinese touch||KOLKATA: Bhagaban Chandra Narada Bala Khatik School in Tangra is an ordinary government school like thousand others in the state. But come elections and this modest school with five classrooms on Matheswartala Road acquires a special status. This is the only polling station which has over 500 Chinese voters on the electoral rolls which is the highest anywhere in the country, according to members of the Chinese community in Tangra’s Chinatown. The TMC even set up a polling camp 200 meters from the school, which had an all-Chinese team to guide the Chinese voters who do not comprehend Bengali clearly. Majority of the portion of Chinatown is a part of the Kasba assembly constituency which went to polls on Saturday. Though there are several polling stations but almost all Chinese voters vote in this Bhagaban Chandra School. “Most of the Chinese, who are residents of Tangra, are voters of the Kasba assembly constituency. A very small part is in the Entally constituency. However, there are very few Chinese voters now,” said Joseph Chen, a local businessman who was sitting in the camp of one of the political parties and guiding the voters in Chinese. “Many of them do not understand Bengali properly. So, we have thought of setting up a camp to help them in Chinese language,” said Chen. Political parties have even started writing wall graffiti and printing posters in Chinese too. According to Chen, there were more than 2,000 voters in the polling station till 2004. However, only 523 Chinese voters are eligible to exercise their franchise in this election. Almost 80 per cent cast their vote on Saturday. “Most youngsters have migrated to other places in the last two decades. Many senior members of the community have expired. Earlier, Chinese families would go in groups to cast their vote. It would be a beautiful sight,” said Chen. A steady exodus of Chinese in the past few decades has shrunk the community from close to 1,00,000 to 1,20,000 in the1950s to a meagre 2,000 to 2,500. Community members say discrimination, lack of opportunities and neglect from the governments are the reasons why the integration of the Indian Chinese into the rest of the population remains a distant dream. “The way population of the Chinese is declining in Kolkata we are not sue how many will remain to vote in the next assembly elections,” said Elizabeth Chu, a stylist who stays in Tangra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/500-odd-chinese-cast-vote-amid-fears-of-shrinking-population/articleshow/82009933.cms||Zeeshan Javed

While there was no assurance yet of fresh stock arriving soon, hospitals kept their fingers crossed and hoped that the residual supply of Covaxin would last till fresh supplies of Covishield reached the city. AMRI Hospitals Salt Lake put up a ‘No Vaccine’ board at its gate and scores returned disappointed. It mentioned that vaccination will remain suspended ‘till further availability’. A large number of people still queued up, claiming they had registered and had slots booked. “However, they have been asked to contact the hospital helpline number to find out when vaccination will start again. Hospital functionaries have been asked to get in touch — after April 15 — with the government store that supplies all CVCs at Salt Lake with vaccine vials every morning,” said a statement issued by AMRI. The other two units of the hospital, at Mukundapur and Dhakuria, vaccinated 543 people. At AMRI Dhakuria, 290 people were vaccinated on Saturday, which included 155 Covishield recipients and 134 Covaxin recipients. While 37 senior citizens took Covishield, 48 senior citizens opted for Covaxin, including 19 who got their second dose. While 118 from the 45-59 age group chose Covishield, 86 opted for Covaxin, including one receiving the second dose. At AMRI Mukundapur, 253 people were vaccinated on Saturday, including 69 senior citizens and 171 from the 45-59 age group, besides five each from both groups getting their second dose of Covishield. Belle Vue Clinic has suspended vaccination on Sunday after it was told that there would be no supply. “We got just 10 vials on Saturday though we had sought 35. We will keep the drive suspended tomorrow,” said CEO P Tondon. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) suspended vaccination for the day due to the elections and non-availability of vaccines. “Due to the elections, the turnout would have been low. Also, had we run out of stock, many would have had to turn back from the gates which we didn’t want. We will resume on Sunday and the health department has assured us that there will be enough supply of Covaxin,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. Peerless Hospital turned out to be an exception. It received 40 vials, or 400 doses, of Covaxin though the number of recipients was low. Only 120 took the jab at the hospital on Saturday. “We have got enough stock for the next two days, but all vials are of Covaxin. There is as yet no clarity if fresh stock will arrive within the next 48 hours,” said CEO Sudipta Mitra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-stocks-run-low-in-city-many-go-home-as-hosps-suspend-drive/articleshow/82009599.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Singh is facing multiple charges, including a “fake encounter” and arrest of 10 people following a dispute over payment at a dhaba on March 4. While framing 10 innocent people, local police had alleged that they were part of a gang and had been hatching a robbery conspiracy. Police had also claimed to have arrested the accused after an encounter and seized six illegal weapons, 80 litres of illicit liquor and 2kg contraband from their possession. Following the dhaba owner’s complaint and TOI’s report, senior police officers in the Agra zone had intervened and an FIR against three policemen was registered on March 23 based on the findings of the preliminary probe. The case was subsequently transferred to neighbouring Aligarh district. One of the accused constables Shailendra Kumar and local liquor mafia Bantu Yadav were arrested on March 26, while inspector Singh and another constable Santosh Kumar kept dodging police. Inspector Singh, meanwhile, landed in further trouble after his name cropped up in connection with the missing 1,400 cartons of illicit liquor from police strong room, as a probe found that “policemen had sold the seized liquor to gangster Yadav” — currently in the custody of police in connection with the fake dhaba encounter. Meerut additional district government counsel (ADGC) Shuchi Sharma said, “Singh surrendered in both the cases pending against him. His colleague Satish Kumar, a constable named in the fake encounter, also surrendered with him. Both policemen were sent to 14 days of judicial custody. They have applied for bail and the hearing for which is scheduled on April 13.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/etah-inspector-wanted-in-fake-encounter-missing-1-4k-liquor-cartons-cases-surrenders-before-anti-corruption-court-in-meerut/articleshow/82009023.cms||Deepak Lavania

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Couple in feud over Rs 2cr flat, civil judge sends them to family court||MUMBAI: In a significant order, the city civil court has clarified that a property dispute arising between a married couple is to be decided by the family court. A city man had filed a suit against his estranged wife to take possession of their Parel flat worth around Rs 2 crore. The civil court said that considering provisions of the Family Courts Act, it did not have jurisdiction to “entertain, try and decide” proceedings between a married couple with respect to their property since a family court is established in the city. “Considering that there is a forum (the family court) available to the plaintiff (husband) that he can approach, instead of rejection of the plaint it is desirable to return the plaint to the plaintiff for its presentation to the proper court,” the civil court said. The woman had moved the court through her lawyer, Mohit Bhardwaj, seeking rejection of her husband’s plea. In his plea submitted earlier this year, the husband had said that he had purchased the flat. It was further claimed that while the loan application was filed jointly by his wife and him, all transactions including the down payment and all EMIs were borne by him. The woman had contributed only Rs 2.5 lakh, he said. He further said that he was the only working member of his family as the woman had quit working 12 years ago. The man’s plea also said that the wife’s name was mentioned in the title deed solely for tax purposes. He claimed to be the “real owner” of the property. He further submitted that their marriage had fallen apart since the beginning as he wanted to reside with his parents. The man said that the wife even wanted to discuss divorce with him. He said that on February 13 when he returned home, he could not unlock the door and enter the house. The man alleged that his wife did not let him in, hence, he moved the court. His plea mentioned that he wanted to invite his parents to the flat due to the pandemic and this had resulted in disputes. The woman, however, said that she was in exclusive possession of the flat since 2004. She further alleged that since the man had claimed that their marriage had broken down from the beginning, it cannot be believed that he purchased the flat in her name.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-couple-in-feud-over-rs-2cr-flat-civil-judge-sends-them-to-family-court/articleshow/82009954.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Chandigarh||‘Courts can order re-evaluation of MCQ answer keys’||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has made it clear that it can permit for re-evaluation of answer keys of objective type or multiple choice competitive examinations even when it is not permitted under the statute, rules or regulations. However, the high court has also held that in case of subjective type answers, the courts are required to adopt a “hands-off” approach regarding re-evaluation. “For an objective type, multiple-choice questions, even if there is a specific bar on re-evaluation of answer sheets, there cannot be a complete ‘hands-off’ approach by the writ courts. However, it is in rarest of the rare cases, where it is shown without any doubt and without resorting to the process of inferential reasoning or rationalization that the question/answer is incorrect and the court would interfere,” the high court held. On the subjective-type examination, the HC clarified, “For a subjective type answer, in which the marking has been uniformly done, the courts are required to adopt a ‘hands off' approach while entertaining a prayer for re-evaluation, as it is best left for the examiner/expert body to analyse the answer and award marks. Further, if there is a categoric bar or no provision at all for re-evaluation, then the courts cannot even permit re-evaluation.” A division bench comprising Justice Jaswant Singh and Justice Sant Parkash passed these orders while hearing a petition filed by Nishant Dutta, who had applied under the general category in the Punjab Civil Services (Judicial Branch) Examination-2019. He had filed the plea for correcting alleged mistakes committed by the paper checker while evaluating English language. His grievance was that in the English language answer sheet, marks have not been granted to him correctly for Question No. 4(1), 4(5), 5(1), 5(5) and 5(6) despite the fact that the answers he had written are correct in nature and genesis. After hearing all the parties, the HC dismissed the petition observing, “We find that each answer carried two marks and the examiner expected the answer to be given in a manner that behoves the post for which they are to be selected i.e. civil judge (junior division) in Punjab. Consequently, it seems that merely knowing the correct answer was not important for the examiner but answering it correctly with usage of correct grammar was paramount”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/courts-can-order-re-evaluation-of-mcq-answer-keys/articleshow/82009940.cms||Ajay Sura

As the specially created paediatric ward is the only Covid-19 ward where a person is allowed with a patient, it’s the doting fathers and mothers here who look after their kids down with infection. Rambir Rajput, a scrap dealer, is staying with his son Saurav for the past 10 days at the Civil Hospital. Saurav, 3, had started developing symptoms such as cough and fever, after which he was taken to a private hospital and referred to Civil Hospital. “I wear a PPE kit and take care of him. Doctors say that his condition is improving,” Rajput told TOI, adding that other members of his family have not got infected. On a nearby bed is Dulani Miriya, a resident of Noblenagar area, who got admitted to Civil Hospital on Saturday with his 14-month-old daughter Mayesha. “I tested positive two days back. But as I had milder symptoms, I was advised home quarantine. Meanwhile, my daughter started developing fever and severe irritation. Thus, we did not waste time. While her report (on Covid-19) is yet to arrive, we have got her admitted to prevent further complications,” she said. Dr Rakesh Joshi, additional medical superintendent of Civil Hospital, said that the hospital has 12 minor patients out of which two are kids and others are adolescents. “The symptoms are milder in children compared to adults, but we are seeing rise in patients with severe symptoms in this wave of the pandemic,” he said.

---||Kolkata||In times of poll disorder, Kasba pink stations turn oases of peace||Kolkata: In the political race of red, green and saffron, pink walked away with the prize for discipline and harmony. Kasba assembly constituency turned a political battle ground soon after voting started on Saturday with reports of clashes, intimidation and malpractices pouring in from different pockets of the area. But a neighbourhood behind Acropolis Mall in Rajdanga was a picture in contrast where voters did not face any trouble or intimidation, exercising their franchise without fear. Two pink polling stations in the DPS Ruby Park and Garden High International School set an example on how polling could be done peacefully. Pink polling booths are electoral booths managed entirely by women. From security personnel to presiding officer to polling agents, every function is performed by women. There are special arrangements for pregnant women and persons with disabilities (PwD), among others. Incidentally none of the mainstream parties has fielded women candidates from Kasba assembly constituency. “There are more than 8,000 voters in both the polling stations in DPS and Garden High schools. For most part of the day, there were long queues of voters in both the polling stations. But there was no report of anyone even talking in a raised voice in these polling stations,” said an election commission officer in charge of the cluster in Rajdanga. A huge number of males too cast their votes in these pink booths. But women outnumbered men there. “The atmosphere has been very reassuring with women constable checking our cards at the entry point. Other women constables guided voters to stand in queue maintaining safe distance,” said Ankita Bhatia, a resident of the Rajdanga Main Road. When some people complained of long queues, women officials patiently listened to their grievances and explained the reason behind the delay. “People immediately calmed down after we spoke to them and explained that due to Covid-19 we are following several guidelines, thereby delaying the process. Nobody complained after that,” said a Kolkata police personnel posted in the polling station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/in-times-of-poll-disorder-kasba-pink-stations-turn-oases-of-peace/articleshow/82009948.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Shimla||Drought-like conditions ruin 10% water schemes in hilly Himachal||SHIMLA: The drought-like conditions prevailing in Himachal Pradesh have hit around 900 water schemes — 10% of the total 9,000 — to the extent of 5% to 30%. According to officials of Jal Shakti department, if the dry weather spell, the situation is likely to get worse. This is not the first time that the state has seen such a dry spell. In 2013 and 2018, too, the state had received less rain and snow during winter, leading to similar conditions. Weather department officials said this year the state has reported 70% less rainfall in January and February and much rainfall is not expected in April and May, but pre-monsoon showers in mid-June are likely to bring some respite. In Shimla zone, over 400 water supply schemes have been hit by the drought-like situation, in Mandi zone over 220 schemes have been impacted, while in Hamirpur and Dharamshala zones 12 and over 73 drinking water schemes have been affected. Jal Shakti department engineer-in-chief Naveen Puri said that Himachal Pradesh has around 9,000 water supply schemes, of which 10% have been affected by 5% to 30%. Emphasising that a master plan has been prepared to deal with the situation, Puri urged people not to panic. He said there will be cause for alarm only if the state does not receive rainfall till June. To avoid any wastage, water leakages are being plugged by launching special drives across the state from April 1-20, and this had helped save around 12 lakh litres of water per day by April 6. Apart from this, different water schemes and sources are also being interlinked to divert water from sources having excess to those areas where it is needed the most. Shimla Meteorological Centre director Manmohan Singh said that there is nothing unusual in the ongoing situation as it depends on the amount of rain and snowfall received in a year. He said that in January-February this year, the state had 70% deficit rainfall compared to 30% less rainfall last year and 45% excess rainfall in 2019. Similarly, the state had recorded 72% less rainfall in 2018, 4% excess rainfall in 2017 and 71% deficiency in 2016. Officials of Jal Shakti department had on Friday made a presentation before the Cabinet on the prevailing situation in the state and it was decided to hold a review meeting under the chairmanship of the HP chief minister Jai Ram Thakur with all stakeholder departments. Later, the CM had held a virtual meeting with the top functionaries of districts and asked deputy commissioners to keep a tab on the situation in their respective districts. He also asked them to monitor the fodder situation regularly so that the farmers do not face any inconvenience. The deputy commissioners have been asked to provide a detailed and consolidated report regarding the agriculture and horticulture crop losses the district has suffered due to the prevailing dry conditions and to identify land for building rainwater harvesting structures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/drought-like-conditions-ruin-10-water-schemes-in-hilly-himachal/articleshow/82009935.cms||---

Police said the accused, Kumar from the same locality, has been stealing bicycles for the past five years. According to police, there have been multiple complaints of missing bicycles over the past few weeks in Pallavaram, following which a special team was formed to look into it.

Police identified him to be Kumar, a coolie in a scrap metal shop in the area, and picked him up for inquiry. “Whenever he spotted a more expensive cycle, he would drop his previous steal and take the pricier one,” an officer said. He had an agent to whom he sold the cycles and used the money to drink. He has been remanded in judicial custody.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/man-32-who-stole-over-50-bicycles-held/articleshow/82009943.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Vaccinations rise as more Covishield doses arrive||PUNE: Covid-19 vaccination coverage in Pune district stabilised on Saturday, after days of widespread vaccine shortages. As many as 530 sites were operational across the region, a huge increase from Friday’s 203 live centres. On Saturday, the total coverage — 79,220 beneficiaries given at least one dose of the vaccine — was the highest in five days. It was also the district’s second-highest count since April 1. The highest single-day coverage was on April 5, when 85,146 beneficiaries were vaccinated. On Saturday, over 48,000 citizens between the ages of 45 and 59 were given their jabs of the vaccine. There were another 25,000-odd recipients in the above-60 category. Friday’s low number of only 203 operational vaccination sites was due to a shortage of vaccines. Officials said numbers improved on Saturday with the arrival of 1 lakh new doses on Friday night. But 29 sites were still not able to hold their sessions. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle said, “Almost all vaccine sites were operating on Saturday. Another 1.1 lakh Covishield doses were sent to Pune district on Saturday. But the existing stock will be enough only for the next three to four days, considering Pune district’s average daily usage of 65,000 doses. The state has started getting fresh stock from the Centre, but the quantity is not enough.” Dr Deshmukh said districts would need reserves that can last at least 10 days. “Such reserves will help us plan drives better,” he said.  Pune zilla parishad CEO Ayush Prasad, said, “The number vaccinated on Saturday crossed 1,000 at five sites in Pune rural. Overall, coverage surpassed 50,000 beneficiaries during the day.” Officials at hospital sites said they were fast running out of doses. Jitendra Oswal, the deputy medical director of Bharati hospital, said, “Of the 290 doses we had on Saturday, we could administer only 270 shots as there were fewer beneficiaries due to the weekend lockdown. But doses are finishing fast and we would need more quantities for Monday’s drive.” City-based Noble Hospital has been unable to conduct its drive for the last three days because of a shortage. HK Sale, executive director of the hospital, said, “We received 200 doses of the Covishield vaccine late on Saturday afternoon. But that supply will be just about enough for a single day’s vaccine drive. We couldn’t launch a session on Saturday because the doses arrived late. We will restart on Monday. Meanwhile, senior Shiv Sena member from the city, Sham Deshpande, said the party has written to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan with a warning that vaccine transport would not be allowed out of Pune city if the Centre does not increase supply to the state. “If you do not increase supplies to Maharashtra in the next eight days, we will not allow vaccines to go out of Pune,” the letter stated. The Covishield vaccine is being manufactured by the city-based Serum Institute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vaccinations-rise-as-more-covishield-doses-arrive/articleshow/82010323.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Lucknow||UP: Minister, MLC, 3 Congress ex-MPs to contest Shia Board polls||AYODHYA: Three former MPs of the Congress –Begum Noor Bano, Akhtar Hussain Rizvi and Syed Sibte Razi – minority affairs minister Mohsin Raza and BJP MLC Bukkal Nawab will be in the fray for the membership of UP Shia Waqf Board from MP/MLA quota. As there is no sitting MP from Uttar Pradesh from Shia sect, former parliamentarians will become eligible to be the members of the Board from MP quota. Likewise, as there is no Shia MLA in Uttar Pradesh, sitting MLCs will fill up the MLA/MLC quota. Both Mohsin Raza and Bukkal Nawab are BJP MLCs. The election of Shia Central Waqf Board will be held on April 20. Assistant election officer Anil Kumar Singh on Saturday issued the list of 38 mutawallis of Shia Waqfs of Uttar Pradesh having income of Rs 1 lakh and above. The name of controversial former chairman of Shia Waqf Board, Waseem Rizvi, is also on the voter list of mutawallis. The voter list has the names of Begum Noor Bano, Akhtar Hussain Rizvi, Syed Sibte Razi, Mohsin Raza and Bukkal Nawab. Talking to TOI, minorities affairs minister Mohsin Raza said, “We will give a clean and non-controversial Waqf Board. Shia Waqf Board has not made any income for the last 15 years. We will try to find sources of income for the Board by using its prime properties.” “Those occupying posts in the past did nothing for the Board and the community. They only filled their pockets. We will give a corruption-free waqf board to the community,” said Raza. “UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has increased the allocation for the welfare of minorities by Rs 68,000 crore,” he added. Chief executive officer of Shia Waqf Board Syed Naseer said, “The state government will nominate three more members – a religious scholar, social worker and a special secretary level government official – to the Board. All of them will be Shias.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/min-mlc-3-cong-ex-mps-to-contest-shia-board-polls/articleshow/82010324.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

A city that scarcely sleeps even by night sank into a daytime stupor. Commonly buzzing precincts such as CSMT, J J flyover, Western and Eastern Express Highways, Mahim Causeway, Bandra Reclamation, Andheri, and Vasai and Virar fell silent. Domestic help, drivers, cooks and garbage collectors stayed away in some areas. Despite the state order permitting domestic help, they were not allowed at Balaji Symphony, a society of New Panvel. “The local gram panchayat has also stopped them and, to make it worse, police are discouraging them too,” said one resident. There were at least four nakabandis from Borivli to Andheri. In Andheri, relatives visiting Ambani Hospital were unable to source tender coconut for patients. Wine shops were open. An order issued by municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal on Saturday stated wine shops can sell liquor via home delivery between 7am and 8pm. Pali Hill corporator Swapna Mhatre said of Khar: “Liquor shops were allowed only home delivery but continued to operate with half shutters.” BEST plied 3,321 buses, or around 1,000 vehicles fewer than on a normal day. April’s weekday ridership had already fallen to 20 lakh from 25 lakh in March, and Saturday’s number depleted further. Factory workers in Mumbai Metropolitan Region, though, faced a harrowing time reaching their place of work. R Srinivasan, chief executive officer, TTC-MIDC Industries Association, said workers at Kalyan, Dombivli, Thane and Navi Mumbai were not allowed to board buses and the association had to request MIDC CEO P Anbalagan to intervene.

By midnight, each expected Saturday’s ridership to be 4-4.25 lakh. Before Covid struck, CR carried 45 lakh passengers and WR 35 lakh every day. Residents of Parel, though, said that unlike the previous lockdown, Ambedkar Road was noisier this time. In Evershine Nagar, Malad, by noon, most essential shops reopened after initial confusion about lockdown rules.

On Satu-rday, pile foundation work was started from City Centre II. In February-end, the construction major started the ground work or barricading stretches of the main arterial road of New Town after Afcons emerged as lowest bidder for the Rs 532.6 crore project last December. “At 4pm on Saturday, we started foundation work. The piling should be completed in eight months,” a senior Afcons engineer said. Afcons is contracted to complete the 3.5km viaduct, two stations — at Chinar Park and VIP Road (named Rabindra Tirtha and Haldiram respectively) — and the 950m underground stretch till the airport by January 2024. As many as 100 piers will be built along the way. “The underground section, through cut-and-cover and box pushing methods, will start in August or September,” the engineer said. The 3.5km from City Centre II station to the airport, where the Noapara-Airport Metro will merge with it, was originally planned to be underground. But land acquisition issues prompted implementing agency Rail Vikas Nigam Limited to amend the design.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pile-foundation-work-starts-for-metros-city-centre-ii-airport-leg/articleshow/82009614.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

Timber Club's decision to bowl first after winning the toss didn't prove good as Sound Images' batsmen dominated the first innings to post a huge total of 261 runs in 40 overs. Almas Shaukat made 66 runs off just 53 balls. Timber Club had a terrible start to their run-chase as their opener departed without bothering the scorers. After this, the club kept losing wickets at regular intervals which restricted them to a score of 211 runs, falling short of the target by 50 runs. Ali Murtaza claimed 4 wickets. Vipraj Nigam was declared the man of the tournament while Abhishek Kaushal and Sourabh Dubey won the award for best batsman and bowler, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/almas-ali-help-sound-images-win-lift-trophy/articleshow/82010332.cms||---

This is what the courts in India, including the Hon’ble Supreme Court have repeatedly held,” the court added. A division bench of Justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan and Justice Chander Bhusan Barowalia, in a judgment on April 5, observed that the case was a glaring example of the respondents “flagrantly and in a most brazen manner” denying the petitioner part of his retiral benefits, constraining him to file the petition. The court also maintained that the action of the respondents in not paying entire retiral dues to the petitioner is unjustified and “clearly illegal.” The court pointed out that the petitioner, on the date of his retirement, did not have a criminal case or any departmental inquiry contemplated or pending against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-restores-forest-range-officers-pension/articleshow/82009947.cms||---

---||Delhi||Covid gives learning on job new meaning||NEW DELHI: For yet another year, university students will be missing hands-on training during internships, with the whole process to be conducted online again. However, this also means more students will be hired, particularly in infotech, finance and management. The majority will work from home and do mostly research work. Jamia Millia Islamia’s placement cell confirmed that placement opportunities coming the way of their students were mostly for remote internships. “Firms are hiring students only for work for home,” said Rehan Suri of the university’s placement cell. “There are very few companies that want a physical presence of interns.” Suri added, however, that the number of internship opportunities had gone up from the number offered last year — with “most hiring happening in the education technology and financial services sectors”. He said many students had been hired for content generation and digital marketing and in the development sector where students need not leave their homes, but hardly any in the manufacturing sector. Saanchi Agarwal, chief secretary of the placement cell at Shri Ram College of Commerce too said the number of internships had increased. “The type of internship offered is totally different now. It is more of a research project from home. Client presentations and face-to-face meetings are, therefore, missing,” said Agarwal, who is a final year economics student. “Earlier, students had to go on trips, visit construction sites and talk to employees. This hands-on experience will be missing.” Kumar Ashutosh, head of the tourism department at Delhi University’s College of Vocational Studies, added, “We always had 100% placement in our department, but this dropped to around 20% last year. The tourism industry is badly hit and the students are facing the brunt. They are not getting internships, so we have opted for projects instead.” Third-year student of tourism Shivam Agarwal had to be content with a project. “Just two or three students managed internships. Only some start-ups are hiring freshers,” he said. Jamia media coordinator Ahmed Azeem was apologetic that the institution was “limited in our scope” in contacting firms for internships. “Jamia has been engaging with the alumni, with companies it has collaborated with earlier and also using available platforms for internships,” Azeem said. A journalism student there rued, “The only opportunity I got was for content writing, but that is not what I want to do.” At Ramjas College, placement cell head Hardeep Kaur also pointed out, “The college’s placement cell is run by students. One drawback for internship drives is that earlier placement cells of several colleges would collaborate on a placement fair. That is not possible now.” To assist students with the placement and internship drive, IIT-Delhi’s Office of Career Services (OCS) has come up with Yukti—Building Relations, a scheme to help students secure full-time roles and summer internships. On April 10 and 11, an event focused on the theme of ‘Careers in the Age of Covid-19’ will also have a job and internship fair, guest panels, workshops, competitions and virtual industrial visits. “Except for the job and internship fair, all other activities are open to non-IIT-D students,” said Anishya Obhrai Madan, OCS head. Madan explained that the scheme was meant to help students to comprehend and compare recruiters and also help them understand and build up their own capabilities via competitions and workshops. “The summer internships and placements have been going well for our students this year. We decided this year also to educate not only IIT students, but also others.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-gives-learning-on-job-new-meaning/articleshow/82009951.cms||Shradha Chettri

Also, six Covid-19 deaths were recorded over the last 24 hours, adding up to a total of 1,752 deaths so far in the state. Telangana has so far recorded 3.24 lakh cases of Covid-19 and a total of 3.04lakh patients in the state have recovered from the infection.

---||Chennai||Lack of internal democracy in political parties riles HC||Chennai: The Constitution envisages governments to be run by collective authority or collective wisdom, but in certain cases it is not even followed in letter, far less in spirit, the Madras high court saidon Saturday.“The Constitution is silent on the nature and qualification of the political parties which put up candidates for election to legislative bodies. It may not have been in the contemplation of the Constitution-makers that though the form of government both at the Centre and in the states was fashioned after the Westminster style. In fact, some of them would be run on the presidential basis as in the United States with a single person or a few persons exercising real authority,” the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy added.The court made the observations while disposing of a public interest writ petition moved by S Surya Moorthi seeking to ensure that all the recognised political parties in the state completed their respective internal organisational elections prior to facing the 2021 assembly election.When the plea came up for hearing, the bench said there was some basis to the PIL and, if nothing else, the sentiment expressed by the petitioner needed to be respected.“The petitioner insinuates that a democratic process of election as envisaged by the Constitution cannot be meaningful without the political parties participating there at embracing the democratic ethos and completing their internal elections in the first place,” the court added.“However, the prayer is to arrest the 2021 general elections to the state assembly until the political parties in the fray, or at least the more prominent parties, conduct their internal elections. Since the assembly elections have already been concluded, the prayer has become infructuous and the relief can no longer be granted,” the judges said.The bench added that the petitioner's sentiment must be respected as it revealed the highest regard for democratic principles.The court then disposed of the plea without going into the matters canvassed by the petitioner and by leaving the petitioner free to press the grounds at a more appropriate stage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/lack-of-internal-democracy-in-political-parties-riles-hc/articleshow/82010682.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Command centre fails to respond timely, leaves many patients hapless||Lucknow: Lack of prompt response from the Integrated Covid Command Centre (ICCC) managed by the district administration even after being informed by cops about a Covid-19 case triggered chaos in Hazratganj on Saturday. The victim was a homeless 40-year-old auto mechanic. “The mechanic stays at the garage on the compound of a petrol pump and got himself tested on April 6. The report came positive on Friday. His co-workers informed the police outpost incharge of SPM Civil Hospital. The cop with the help of an LMC team isolated the patient in the garage and called ICCC twice and requested for the patient’s hospitalisation,” said SHO, Hazratganj, Shyam Babu Shukla. However, when no help came till Saturday morning, some mediapersons highlighted the plight of the man following which DM Abhishek Prakash took cognisance and got the mechanic hospitalised at RSM hospital. ADM, east, KP Singh, said, “As soon as we got to know about the patient, an ambulance was dispatched to take him to the hospital. “ However, some more residents complained about not getting adequate response from the ICCC. Niranjan Prasad’s mother tested positive on Saturday. “The attendant at the ICCC asked me to text the test report on a WhatsApp number, but thereafter the helpline was constantly engaged when I called several times for follow up. Finally, with the help of some contacts, got a referral for hospitalisation of my mother to a private hospital,” he said. Shubham Singh of Balaganj tested positive on March 31 and opted for home isolation. He called ICCC when his condition deteriorated on April 6. “I was assured assistance but when no help came even after five hours, I called a doctor who arranged for my hospitalisation,” he said. Likewise, Anup Narayan Singh from Gomtinagar, who tested positive on April 7, said he called ICCC at 10am on April 8 and requested for hospitalisation as his oxygen level was dropping. After several follow up calls, the help came around 3pm. However, district administration officers denied allegations. On Saturday alone, they said, ICCC callers contacted 6,707 patients in home isolation or who have tested positive recently on the phone to enquire about their health. The officers also said that 158 patients called at Hello doctor service for help. The numbers of ICCC are 0522-4523000, 0522-2610145 and Hello Doctor 0522-3515700. Meanwhile, in a late night development, chief development officer, Lucknow, Prabhas Kumar and LDA secretary Pawan Kumar Gangwar were made in charge of the ICCC for better coordination and management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/command-centre-fails-to-respond-timely-leaves-many-patients-hapless/articleshow/82010334.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Covid task force meet today, relief steps tomorrow||MUMBAI: While a Covid task force meeting is likely on Sunday, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar will call for a meeting to plan the relief measures on Monday. It is likely that an official announcement will be made on Monday or Tuesday. All the alliance partners have supported the decision for a lockdown and opposition leaders have asked the government to announce a relief package for all those who will be impacted. The meeting on Saturday was held to arrive at a consensus on a lockdown in the state. Thackeray said there is no option but to go in for stricter curbs. “The number of patients is increasing so fast that if we do not decide on a lockdown today, a lockdown-like situation will automatically arise tomorrow,” said Thackeray. “This is a health emergency and so priority should be given to the lives of the people. The situation is grim and we have to impose strict restrictions to slow down the spread,” said Thackeray. Senior officials said while current restrictions will continue, unchecked day-time movement on weekdays may be restricted too. He said the government is likely to continue with public transport such as trains, autos and buses for essential workers and for the general public for essential activities and emergencies. “There are nearly 60,000 people who head out to vaccination centres in Mumbai every day. There will be students going out for exams. Public transport will continue for all those who have a valid reason to step out,” said the official. Also, long-distance trains will continue to run so that no one is stuck and there is no panic. Opposition leaders said the government should come up with a comprehensive plan before any more restrictions are added. They also said relief measures and monetary packages for migrants, traders and daily wage workers should be announced. Subsidised foodgrains should be made available for all those who will be impacted. “While imposing more restrictions, the government should take into account the public’s sentiments. Relief must be extended to small traders, retailers and salon owners whose business is also impacted,” said Devendra Fadnavis, leader of the opposition. He said medicines, oxygen supply and health infrastructure should be ramped up in both cities and rural areas. “We are all concerned about the poor and working class. We will think about their problems too, but at the moment we need to stop the rapid spread. If we have to win this fight, we all have to go through some hardship,” said Thackeray. “There was a debate whether a seven-day lockdown would suffice, but health officials said at least 15 days are needed,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-covid-task-force-meet-today-relief-steps-tomorrow/articleshow/82010354.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Kolkata||Brace for worst, say doctors as Kolkata records year’s highest single-day spike with 997 new Covid cases||KOLKATA: The number of fresh Covid-19 positive cases in Kolkata on Saturday touched an all-time high with the city recording 997 cases. While this has been the highest single-day spike in the second wave, it also surpassed the maximum the city had recorded on a single day during the first wave last year, which was 931 cases on October 31. Healthcare experts had been apprehensive of an exponential rise in the city, especially during the elections. A part of the city, in the southern fringes went to polls on Saturday, along with adjacent Howrah and South 24 Parganas. Doctors warned that the city should brace for the worst in the next two-three weeks. “Even in western countries, the second wave have been worst than the first. In Bengal with the polls adding to the situation, the scenario looks very bleak,” said microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri. The number of fresh cases in the city had dipped as low as 33 in the beginning of March. Even when the numbers has started rising, the pace was slow. The explosion begun around March end. From 513 fresh cases on April 2, it swelled to 987 on Friday and then to 997 on Saturday. “The situation seems to be spiralling out of control. With several rounds of polls yet to be conducted over the next fortnight, it is going to get much worse. People should realize that we need to go back to all Covid-19 appropriate behaviour that most of us had adhered to during the previous wave,” said Sumon Poddar associate professor at Institute of Child Health Kolkata. The medical fraternity had been reiterating the need to stick by the Covid-19 protocols during electioneering process. But the rules have been widely violated. Out of the 21,366 s active cases across the state at present Kolkata’s share is 6513. Along with Kolkata, North 24 Parganas, too, is galloping with massive upsurge in positive cases. “The healthcare system is already under much pressure with critical care beds running short in most Covid facilities. Going by the continuous onslaught by the rapidly rising numbers this is going to be a bigger acid test for the health administration that what we had faced during the first wave,” said a senior health department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/brace-for-worst-say-docs-as-city-records-years-highest-single-day-spike-with-997-new-cov-cases/articleshow/82009625.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The elections have been postponed for an indefinite period following a request made by political parties including the BJP, the Congress, and the AAP, as well as several social groups. “Taking in view the grave situation caused by the pandemic, to maintain public health and ensure that voting is done in a free and fair environment, the State Election Commission has decided to postpone this election till further orders,” the SEC said. As per the earlier programme, the elections were scheduled to be held on April 18. Last year, the civic body polls were delayed by the SEC with permission from the Supreme Court for three months. The term for elected bodies in municipal corporations and taluka as well as district panchayats were to end in December 2020, but because of Covid-19 pandemic, the SEC decided to delay the polls for three months and accordingly sought permission from the apex court for the delay. After the schedule was announced for the GMC elections, members of the Congress party even made a request to the Gujarat high court seeking postponement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gandhinagar-civic-elections-deferred/articleshow/82010688.cms||---

On Saturday, crime branch sleuths caught a 24-year-old biotechnology graduate for impersonating an IPS officer to avoid the queues in the state-run Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay (PDU) Hospital and to get privileges during treatment for his relatives. The arrested person, Sanket Mehta, works as a nutrition officer for a multinational company engaged in the food and beverages business. His relatives were admitted in the civil hospital. “Mehta searched on Google for the symbol of the national academy that trains IPS officers and copied it. He then made a fake identity card of an IPS officer. He used to identify himself as an IPS officer in the Covid control room of the hospital and get privileged treatment from the staff on duty,” said V K Gadhvi, police inspector, crime branch. The uncle of Mehta’s brother-in-law is admitted at the hospital’s Covid ward. “There is a heavy rush in Covid hospitals because of the surge in cases and he had to stand in long queues for his relative. Hence he hit upon his idea of impersonation for easy entry and treatment,” said Gadhvi. The case came to light when the crime branch sleuths received information about some IPS officer’s relative who was hospitalized and they went to check at the control room set up on the ground floor of Chaudhari High School. When the cops reached there, Mehta continued behaving as an IPS officer and produced his ID card. However, he could not give proper replies to the questions of the real cops and finally broke down and confessed. He was arrested and booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and his mobile phone was seized.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/mnc-worker-impersonates-ips-officer-to-avoid-queues/articleshow/82009122.cms||---

Teams of AMC’s solid waste management department shut several paan shops in the city on Saturday evening in areas including Prahladnagar, Odhav, Vastral, Sindhu Bhavan Road and Navrangpura. People as well as shop owners were in a state of frenzy as AMC officials shut the shops without any official directive. The civic body officials did not cite the number of shops or the reason why they were being shut. “Though shop owners had voluntarily decided to keep shops shut, the civic body officials forced many to down shutters. Even as shop owners are being considerate towards public health at the cost of their business, the civic authorities are exerting force for no reason.

"People with dusky skin rarely find off-the-shelf beauty products that work for them," says the city-based entrepreneur.However recently, the 47-year-old received an offer from a friend she couldn’t refuse; to pick a shade of lipstick from the colour wheel that went with her skin, along with a texture and aroma that she liked.Beauty is personal and you should be able to decide what goes on your skin. That’s why, a new tribe of beauty entrepreneurs are customising products that cater to various needs of clients — from cruelty-free, DIY lipsticks and foundations, to shampoos with formulas and products that can be put together by a user as per their fancy.Sabrina Suhail, a Bengaluru-based make-up entrepreneur and founder of Tinge, was one of the first in the country to make handcrafted lipsticks in 2017."To cater to my clients’ needs, I often had to mix lipstick shades to arrive at one desirable shade," she says. And so, she created the brand to provide make-up wearers the exact shade they want."They can even name the shade, which makes each lipstick special," she says. Most clients name their products based on a certain time in their life or a story that brings back memories. "The process of making your shade and naming it, recreates that memory," adds Suhail. "The one that is close to my heart is ‘Sasha’, an orange liquid lipstick, the colour of which reminds me of my first cat," she says.The make-up expert sits with her customers in her studio to choose the colours, and blend them by hand with aromatic essence and glitters. The customer then tries on the shade and makes adjustments to arrive at the their choice.Suhail, who has done a course in organic formulation and chemistry, believes that the chemical composition is crucial. Her lip products and foundations are vegan, cruelty-free and paraben-free.Hyderabad-based Avni Sricharan and Dyuti Waghray are founders of Lip Hue, which was started in 2019 and offers personalised lip shades that suit diverse Indian skin tones. Lip Hue has a unique AR-enabled website as well as a studio with a ‘smart mirror’ in Banjara Hills. "The shades you see on the package may look just right, but on the lip, they may look completely different," says Sricharan. Which is where their AR-enabled website allows customers to try on the shade through their phone camera. "The reds and nudes available in the market are very similar. Therefore, there is a growing demand for customisation. No two nudes we have sold are the same. Every lipstick has a unique hue," says Sricharan. "Understanding the undertone of one’s skin is important. There are three types of undertones — cool, warm and neutral. You can determine your undertone with the colour of your veins in the hand," says the 31-year-old.Lip Hue, which uses a centrifugal blending machine to get seamless results, offers 10 fragrances, including bubble gum, mango and citrus mist. "Café mocha is very popular among nude shades," she says.In haircare too, personalised products are becoming a hit, as they cater to specific maintenance problems.Four months ago, Arbaz Ali Khan, a 22-year-old financial advisor who recently moved from Chennai to Hyderabad, filled out a questionnaire for Bare Anatomy, a Gurugram-based hair care brand started by Rohit Chawla. It featured questions about the scalp, hair texture, and the user’s lifestyle. Arbaz, who was looking for a shampoo and conditioner to make his hair thicker, says the products have worked well. "I have always wanted to grow my hair and it is now possible. Yes, they are expensive, but they offer a focused solution to the problem," he says."The formula changes for each hair type and goal. We have machines that detect the algorithm of each client and dispense the right weight of each chemical," says Chawla. "One of our founding members is a scientist, who takes care of the chemical composition of the products," says Chawla who also founded The Man Company, a men’s grooming products company in 2015, which is now defunct.According to Mumbai-based celebrity cosmetic dermatologist, Dr Jaishree Sharad, personalised products look at several aspects, such as the user’s exposure and sensitivity to heat or cold, the pores on their skin, and even their profession. "While just filling out a form should not be the basis to decide a product, we must admit that the industry is still at a nascent stage in India. Any personalised product should be well-planned; it is important to listen to your skin each day as it changes frequently," she says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/want-a-new-lipstick-make-it/articleshow/82010686.cms||Harshitha Kumayaa
---||Lucknow||Four more LU teachers in Covid grip, teaching affected in 9 departments||LUCKNOW: The Covid-19 outbreak in Lucknow University infected four more teachers on Saturday, taking the total number of infections to 19, hampering online teaching in nine departments. With two faculty members each in physics and engineering departments getting infected, as many as 13 professors have contracted the virus in the last 10 days. According to students, the number of lectures per day has already gone down after they shifted from offline to online classes and now with teachers getting infected, they have not had a single class of a particular paper in the last one week. The university had shifted from offline to online teaching mode from April 1 after a retired professor of zoology department, Prof AK Sharma, passed away due to Covid 19 and at least six faculty members were tested positive. The departments where teaching is the most affected are Sanskrit, physics, engineering and English with three faculty members each having coronavirus infection. Commerce and fine arts have two Covid-19 cases each while chemistry, philosophy and public administration departments have recorded one case each. “We had just four online lectures of two papers each in last 10 days. A majority of our teachers have tested Covid positive. The biggest fear of all students is that we are running five months behind the schedule and if our lectures are not held, syllabus will not be completed timely. We will have to appear for the examination by studying on our own,” said BA (second year) student Saurabh Pandey.“When classes were held offline we had three lectures daily but since teaching has shifted to online mode there is only one lecture. There are days when there is no class.  Our only professor who was regular with the classes has tested Covid positive,” said BCom (first semester) student Ankit Singh. In physics department, two more professors were infected with the virus on Saturday after which officiating head, Prof NK Pandey, allocated papers of the respective teachers to another faculty member. LU spokesperson Durgesh Srivastava said, “We have asked the head of the departments to make a temporary arrangement by allotting the subjects of the faculty who have tested positive to another teacher.” Meanwhile, several non-teaching employees and three girls have tested positive. The dean (Arts) and head of the department of Jyotir Vigyan and director of Abhinavagupt Institute of Aesthetics and Shaiva Philosophy, Padma Shri Prof Brijesh Shukla (58) died battling the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/four-more-lu-teachers-in-covid-grip-teaching-affected-in-9-depts/articleshow/82010339.cms||---

This branch will work to meet the demand of remote areas up to the Chinese border even when the road is closed in winter. The Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) that markets Amul brand has opened its 70th branch at Leh. The branch is fully equipped with ambient, cool and frozen warehousing and logistics infra, GCMMF officials said. The road connecting Srinagar, where Amul already has a branch, to Leh remains closed for nearly six months. “We have three distributors who stock up supplies for the months of winter but yet they cannot continue providing their supplies in remote areas bordering China,” said R S Sodhi, managing director of GCMMF. During the winter months, the logistic movement continues within the Leh-Ladakh region. “We have opened our full-ledged office with warehouse facility so that we can keep stock when the roads are open and keep serving all the remote areas, distributors from Leh among others for 365 days,” he said. Leh-Ladakh region has proven to be a good market for Amul products like butter, tetrapak milk and mithai mate. Butter is amongst the top-selling product because of butter tea or gur gur chai which is a popular drink amongst locals in the Leh-Ladakh region. “But so far, the variety available to consumers was limited. Now, a wide range of dairy products from ice-creams, chocolates, frozen products and cheese to butter, milk among others will be available to them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/taste-of-india-to-serve-remote-areas-on-indo-china-border/articleshow/82008970.cms||Prashant Rupera
---||Ranchi||‘Uptick in Cov figures not linked to election’||RANCHI: Even before the Election Commission of India had announced the April 17-Madhupur bypoll, all political parties had started routine election processes like cadre movement, campaigning and others. Along with the poll fever, the number of fresh cases also started rising in Deoghar district, which houses the assembly constituency, but experts believe the rise in cases is not related to the high-pitched election battle. This is the third bypoll in the state during the pandemic. The earlier two — Dumka and Bermo — were held in November. Although constituency-specific number of Covid infections is not available, going by the figures of Deoghar district, it is evident that the caseload increased substantially in March to reach 82 as against 44 cases recorded in February and 40 in January. In the first six days of April, the district has already recorded 120 fresh cases. During the same period, test figures have registered a regular dip. Against 22,091 tests conducted in January, only 16,536 tests were carried out in February while it marginally increased to 18,325 in March. Despite official confirmation of a second wave in April, only 3,197 tests have been carried out in the first week of April. Medical experts link this surge to the statewide uptick. “Infections are increasing since March-end in almost the entire state and we have started increasing the number of tests. When infections were lower, number of samples coming for tests had also reduced,” said state head of the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) Dr Praveen Kumar Karn. President, Jharkhand unit of Indian Medical Association, Dr A K Singh admitted that there is no scientific explanation available for this. “The way mass gatherings are happening in West Bengal, Covid-19 cases should have surpassed that of Maharashtra’s count, but somehow there is no outbreak,” he said Public health expert Dr Devesh also believes that more study needs to be conducted. “The virus has impacted the urban pockets mostly which is evident from the figures of Ranchi and East Singhbhum and why it has not impacted the rural sides, particularly the places where elections in Jharkhand were held, is not yet clear,” he said. No substantial outbreak of the infection was noticed even during the Bermo and Dumka bypolls. Both the seats went for polling on November 3 and there were a series of political meetings, rallies and congregations at these places. Bermo comes under Bokaro district while Dumka comes under Dumka district and at both the districts recorded only a few cases in November and December compared to their counts in October 2020. While Bokaro had 1,427 Covid cases in October, Dumka had 198. In November 2020, after the election, the cases dipped to 681 in Bokaro and 78 in Dumka. It further decreased to 417 in Bokaro and 45 in Dumka in December. During the same period, the number of tests also came down in the districts. While Bokaro conducted 70,000 tests in October, only 36,000 were performed in December. Similarly, as against 43,000 tests in Dumka in October, only 25,000 were conducted in December.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/uptick-in-cov-figures-not-linked-to-election/articleshow/82009928.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

He added, “CM Hemant Soren, who is otherwise a novice in politics, donned the leader’s hat in JMM solely because he is the son of party president Shibu Soren. Likewise, Hafizul Hassan was made the JMM candidate for being the son of late Hazi Hussain Ansari. By inducting him into the state cabinet, the ruling dispensation has made Hassan into a minister even before he won the election. But his induction is not going to guarantee a win for JMM as a majority of the voters have made it a point to teach the party a lesson.” The former chief minister went on to say JMM would met with the same fate it did in the Tamar by-election when the then CM Shibu Soren had to step down from his post after losing the bypoll. He further said that the ruling alliance is a conglomerate of parties that have reservations regarding changting ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ and ‘Vande Mataram’ because they want to appease a particular community. On the other hand, CM Hemant Soren, who addressed an election meeting at Lakhangadiya in Deoghar block of the constituency, accused the erstwhile BJP government of doing away with welfare schemes introduced by JMM. “Whether it is snatching ration cards from lakhs of families or doing away with the distribution of dhotis and sarees at a subsidised rate, the Raghubar Das-led government had scrapped all the schemes introduced by my government for the welfare of the downtrodden people. Our government, however, regularised them all soon after coming back to the power,” Hemant said. He also listed the steps taken by the mahagathbandhan government last year to bring back stranded migrant workers during the lockdown last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jmm-flag-bearer-of-dynasty-politics-babulal/articleshow/82009934.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

SDPO (Hazaribag sadar) Vidya Bhushan Kumar said the FIRs were lodged under sections 188 and 234 of the Disaster Management Act and different sections of the IPC at the Hazaribag sadar and Korrah police stations. Among the arrested teachers, two have been identified as Rajesh Prasad and Mahesh Mandal. Kumar further said police had used drones and cameras to identify the men who allegedly instigated the students on Friday. The students were protesting against the government's April 6 order to shut all educational institutes until further orders at the behest of the teachers and other people. They raised slogans like "Padhne do ya marne do". Following the protests, several vehicles and commuters along the NH-100 which connects Hazaribag with Dhanbad, Giridih, Bishnugarh, Bagodar and Bokaro were stranded According to the protesters, the government should relax its order since prolonged closure of the coaching institutes will affect their preparations for the board and competitive examinations and harm their prospects. The SDPO, however, said it was too dangerous to reopen the institutes given the surge in Covid cases in the district. He said, "Under no circumstances can the coaching centers be allowed to reopen when the prohibitory orders are in effect across the district till April 30.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/nh-100-blockade-4-teachers-arrested-firs-filed-against-29/articleshow/82009949.cms||Abhijit Sen

The surveys will be held in Hazaribag and Koderma districts. Forest department officials said that a meeting in this regard was held in Hazaribag on Friday. AIIMS representative Dr Ram Kishore Sao said his organisation plans to carry out research on the use of local herbal plant Kutchnar (Bauhinia Variegata) on the health and immunity of people living around forests. He requested the forest department officials to provide the list of villages where Kutchnar trees are found and are a part of the diet of the locals. Sao said a 24 –member team would be involved in the survey and people found ill will also be treated. The forest department assured that the list of villages under Hazaribag west, Hazaribag east and the Koderma forest divisions will be provided to the team. Sao added AIIMS also plans to conduct a detailed survey on the adverse impact of use of wood as fuel on the health of rural women. The regional conservator of forest (RCCF), Hazaribag, Sanjiv Kumar suggested that the primitive Birhor tribe be included in both the surveys. Divisional forest officer, Hazaribagh west, R N Mishra stressed on the inclusion of all medicinal plants in the survey. The participants also discussed infrastructure for a control room, store room and accommodation during the survey, which is expected to begin in the next 10 days. A coordination committee has also been formed to carry out the surveys. Kumar said, “This survey will be a first-of-its-kind in Jharkhand. Our main objective is to scientifically validate the traditional knowledge possessed by village dwellers, including those from the tribal communities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/aiims-survey-on-impact-of-herbal-plants-in-2-dists-soon/articleshow/82009924.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Goa||Sakhali no-confidence: HC orders meeting on April 16||Panaji: The high court of Bombay at Goa has directed the director of municipal administration to take all steps to see that the meeting for consideration of the no-confidence motion against the chairperson of the Sankhali Municipal Council, Yeshwant Shrikant Madkar, is held on April 16. “If for this purpose the director has to issue notices to the councillors, he should ensure that the same are issued at the earliest so that there are no complaints on this issue. The deputy collector, who has been deputed to preside over the meeting, should also ensure that such a meeting is held on April 16, 2021. The notice for holding the meeting on April 30, 2021 is consequently modified to that extent,” stated the division bench comprising justices Mahesh Sonak and M S Jawalkar. The court found that the director of municipal administration acted “quite unreasonably” in fixing the meeting for consideration of motion of no-confidence almost six weeks after the receipt of the requisition. “As noted earlier, the removal of an elected office bearer on the loss of confidence is an essential feature of democracy. Such a feature cannot be defeated by the director by simply delaying holding of a meeting to even consider such a motion,” the court stated. “According to us, therefore, the director was required to display utmost urgency upon the receipt of the requisition of no less than six councillors out of the 13 for holding a motion of no-confidence against the chairperson, Yeshwant Shrikant Madkar,” the court stated. The court added that the director was also required to take into consideration the circumstance that a vacancy had arisen on November 21, 2020 and the petitioners had even petitioned the high court for holding by-elections at the earliest. “No doubt, Section 56(3) of the said Act gives the director 10 days to convene a meeting for considering a motion of no-confidence. However, that is the maximum period. Further, there is indeed no time limit prescribed for holding the meeting for considering a motion of no-confidence. That does not mean that such holding can be delayed unreasonably or without any valid reasons,” the court held. The Sankhali Municipal Council comprises 13 councillors of which six had petitioned the High Court seeking directions to the director of municipal administration to fix an early date for considering the no-confidence motion which they moved against the chairperson. One out of the 13 councillors, Damodar Ghadi expired on November 21, 2020 and soon after some petitioners moved the court seeking directions to hold by-elections to fill the vacancy. The by-elections were ultimately held on March 20 and the results declared on March 22. But even before the elections, on March 18, the petitioners requested the director of municipal administration to hold a special meeting to consider the no-confidence motion against the chairperson, based on which the director issued a notice dated March 26 for holding a meeting on April 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sakhali-no-confidence-hc-orders-meeting-on-april-16/articleshow/82010368.cms||---

The court found that the “criminal process has been abused” by the police “by registering the FIR based upon a vague complaint”. “According to us, this is a case where the complaint or the FIR does not disclose the commission of any offense. The basic ingredients necessary to invoke the provisions of section 295-B of the IPC are totally missing,” the high court stated. The members of Dastaan Live were “unnecessarily arrested, possibly because they refused to tender any apology at the police station” and some were forced to seek anticipatory bail the court stated, adding that “police authorities, without even examining the complaint or for that matter the provisions of Section 295-A, hurriedly registered the FIR and then proceeded to even arrest some of the petitioners.” “This is certainly not how the police machinery should act in a matter of this nature,” the court remarked. The court agreed with counsel Shivan Desai, representing the petitioners, who stated that the FIR was registered hurriedly and possibly without even perusing the complaint. “Mr Desai is quite right in his submission that this was an unwarranted assault on creativity and freedom of speech and expression itself,” the division bench comprising justices Mahesh Sonak and M S Jawalkar stated. The court found that the police “has precisely chosen to take a sentence here and a sentence there or rather, a word here and a word there and on such basis filed a vague complaint which does not even spell out the basic ingredients of Section 295-A. Besides, the police authorities have completely ignored the dictum of the Supreme Court which provides that the effect of the words must be judged from the standards of reasonable, strong-minded, firm, and courageous men and not those of weak and vacillating minds nor of those who scent danger in every hostile point of view”. “There are no allegations of insult or attempts to insult the religion or the religious beliefs of that class. To simply allege that “Om” which is a symbol of the complainant's faith “in negative narrative” or “abusing people chanting the Om and followers to Hindu stream as Ullu ke Patta” is by no means sufficient to spell out the ingredients of Section 295-A. Further, to allege “blasphemy of my religion and sentiment of hundred crores of India and few million abroad” also does not spell out the ingredients of Section 295-A.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fir-against-dastaan-live-based-on-vague-complaint/articleshow/82010442.cms||---

Otherwise, we will remove them,” he said while launching a desilting project, in Calangute, on Friday.

The state reported 3,339 new cases in the last 24 hours, after 2,765 cases on April 9, and 2,558 cases on April 8. With the case numbers growing by the day, the government has intensified its vaccination drive. Though vaccines are now being administered in village and ward secretariats, besides government and private hospitals, and primary health centres, the surge continues. The chief minister again wrote an open letter to voters of Tirupati, informing them of his decision to cancel the tour. “The health of every single citizen matters to me. Out of wanting to show affection and love, thousands of citizens could turn up at my public meeting if I decide to go ahead with it. All these are ‘My People’. Their health and happiness is of utmost importance to me. Therefore, being a responsible CM, I have decided to cancel my trip to the poll-bound constituency,” Jagan wrote. He further said that despite the government’s best efforts, the positivity rate continues to grow and now stands at 8.67 per cent. “Chittoor district has reported the maximum number of 496 cases in the state. Nellore has also reported 292 cases in the last 24 hours. Out of the 11 deaths reported in the state in the last 24 hours, four are from the districts of Chittoor and Nellore,” the CM wrote. He urged voters to once again support YSRC and its candidate Dr M Gurumurthy in the ensuing Tirupati Lok Sabha by-election and promised to continue the welfare initiatives of his government in the days to come.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cm-cancels-election-meeting-in-tirupati/articleshow/82009285.cms||Gopi Dara

District SP Kaginelli Fakeerappa said a 27-year-old auto driver from Bengaluru, identified as BA Chetan Kumar, became friends with one Arun, a resident of Chennai, a few days ago and managed to become his confidant. On March 28, Arun sent Chetan to Raigarh in Chattisgarh. During his 10-day stay in Raigarh, several persons met the auto driver and gave him the cash. On April 8, he reached Hyderabad carrying over Rs 3 crore in cash when he was intercepted by SEB sleuths at Panchalingala check-post. In the other incident, police seized gold jewellery weighing 1,012 grams worth Rs 56 lakh. The seized gold belongs to a Hyderabad-based jeweller, cops said, adding that the executives of the jewellery store were moving the metal without proper bills.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cops-seize-rs-3cr-cash-1-kg-gold/articleshow/82009295.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

These edible sachets would neither generate plastic waste nor require to be thrown in the trash. Scientists in Visakhapatnam are currently working on this very paradigm of food packaging, which could potentially make the food industry zero-waste and ecologically sustainable in the long run. The Central Institute of Fisheries Technology (ICAR-CIFT) in Visakhapatnam is carrying out research on seaweed or macroalgae and has recently developed edible, biodegradable films and sachets from seaweed. After fine-tuning the technology, CIFT plans to partner with firms for commercial production of edible biopolymers for use in the food industry. Speaking to TOI, Jesmi Debbarma, researcher on seaweed at CIFT, said, “We used dried, powdered seaweed and added sodium alginate or polysaccharide extracted from seaweed along with minute quantity of natural plasticizer to prepare the edible and functional seaweed film. Red seaweed (Kappaphycus alvarezii) and local green seaweed (Ulva sp) have been used.” “Seaweed based edible and functional film has good sealing, antioxidant properties and can be used as novel eco-friendly packaging material in the food industry as sachet, pouch or bag for seasoning powder for instant noodles, instant coffee and tea and can replace the aluminium foil and plastic packaging that is currently being used,” added scientist Debbarma. CIFT-Vizag principal scientist and scientist-in-charge R Raghu Prakash said,“Since seaweeds are not a popular item for direct consumption in India, we at ICAR-CIFT, we have developed alternatives such as fortification in fish seaweed sausage, seaweed cookies and seaweed-based health drinks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/going-green-scientists-come-up-with-sachets-you-can-eat/articleshow/82009315.cms||Sulogna Mehta

---||Delhi||50% capacity cap put on Delhi bars, eateries, Metro, buses||NEW DELHI: The Delhi government on Saturday prohibited all social, entertainment, cultural and other gatherings, capped the number of people at funerals at 20 and at weddings at 50. The restrictions announced in the Delhi Disaster Management Authority order include a 50% cap on the seating capacity in restaurants, bars, Delhi Metro coaches and buses. The DDMA also barred spectators in stadia and capped at 50% the seating capacity in cinemas, multiplexes and theatres. All these restrictions are with immediate effect and will remain till April 30. A negative RT-PCR report (not older than 72 hours) has been made compulsory for anyone flying in from Maharashtra. Passengers without a negative report will have to remain quarantined for 14 days. Constitutional and government functionaries and their staff members are, however, exempted if they are not symptomatic. CM Arvind Kejriwal ruled out another lockdown. Working to revert to November level of preparedness, says KejriwalA night curfew from 10pm to 5am has already been imposed in the capital till April 30. All private organisations located in the capital have been advised to stagger office timings and also stagger the presence and quantum of staff with the objective to reduce the number of employees attending office at the same time. They have been further advised to follow the practice of work from home as far as possible. "It has become necessary to take certain emergency measures to prevent and contain the spread of the virus in the interest of public health," the order by DDMA stated. All Delhi government offices will function with officers of the level of grade one and above to the extent of 100% strength while the remaining staff will attend upto 50% as per requirement to be assessed by head of the department while the remaining 50% will work from home. However, in health & family welfare and all related medical establishments, police, prisons, home guards, and all other essential services shall function without any restrictions. There is no restriction on inter-state and intra-state movement of people and goods, including those for crossland border trade under treaties with neighbouring countries. No separate permission is required for such movements. All schools, colleges and educational institutions will remain closed. Online/distance learning shall continue to be permitted and shall be encouraged. However, students of Classes 9 to 12 may be called to school only for providing academic guidance and support to students for various examinations after following the prescribed standard operating procedure for Covid safety issued by the directorate of education and with the consent of parents. The use of all swimming pools, except being used for training of sportspersons for participation in national and international events, are prohibited. The CM also underlined the laxity which crept into the system and agencies after the third wave of Covid, which hit the capital in November last year, passed and daily cases dropped significantly. "We are currently in a comfortable position with reference to beds and ventilators. We will ensure that the people of Delhi stay safe to the best of our abilities. Lockdown is not an option. We will announce the restrictions in the coming few days. Covid centres are being rebuilt and some have already started functioning," Kejriwal said. He announced that the Delhi government will do preparations like it did during the third Covid wave in November last year to tackle the fourth wave. The CM said that Delhi has 7-10 days’ stock of Covid vaccines and again appealed to the Centre to remove the age restriction for taking the jab because inoculating everyone will help. He said the Delhi government is ready to vaccinate all within 2-3 months if the restrictions are removed. "Lok Nayak Hospital has 2,000 beds. During the last wave, all 2,000 were declared as Covid beds. Right now, we have declared 1,500 as Covid beds, 500 beds are still non-Covid. Slowly, the OPD will also be shut down at the hospital and, if the situation demands, all 2,000 will be made available for Covid patients," the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/50-capacity-cap-put-on-delhi-bars-eateries-metro-buses/articleshow/82011728.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Chandigarh||Farmers block eways, urge Dalits to oppose Hry govt||Bathinda: Acting on the call given by the Sanyukta Kisan Morcha, farmers blocked the two peripheral expressways around Delhi on Saturday morning. Kundali-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) and Kundli-Ghaziabad-Palwal (KGP) expressways will stay unavailable to commuters till 8am on Sunday. A large number of youth and women had arrived from Punjab and Haryana to block the highway. Farmer leaders termed the blockade a “warning” and said if the Union government did not accept their demand, more pressure would be put on the government. The farm activists also managed langar and drinking water on the highway. Farmers protesting at the Tikri border also blocked the KMP while farmers holding protest at Singhu border blocked the KMP at three sites. During the protest, the Haryana Police picked up the farmers protesting in Rewasan, Mewat but released them later. The kisan morcha claimed, “Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar is organising an event near the Singhu border on April 14, while deputy CM is to attend a programme at Kaithal. Farmers of Haryana are constantly boycotting the BJP-JJP government. The Khattar government can present it in such a way that the farmers are not allowing the programmes of Dalits whereas reality is that none of the acts by the farmer is against Dalits.” “While since the last few years, the BJP government in Haryana has treated the Dalits indifferently. Now Khattar government is trying to create a fight between the Dalits and farmers. BJP can also provoke and spread violence in these programmes,” it alleged. The morcha urged all Dalit organisations in Haryana to peacefully oppose the Khattar government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-block-eways-urge-dalits-to-oppose-hry-govt/articleshow/82011795.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Guest column: Dealing with gladiator syndrome in Khaki||The current month has been disastrous for the reputation of police forces, with the ongoing sordid drama of Mumbai police, followed by Bijapur ambush. It is more painful as I had the privilege of ample opportunities to not only work with the police but also serve on deputation with AR, the only PMF. In the process, naturally, there is a fair degree of appreciation, understanding and sympathy for the conditions in which our Khaki Yodhas serve. Unlike Army, police establishments - lines, posts, messes, are all well below acceptable standards, mandating urgent upgrade. Equipment and transportation is another sorry tale, despite release of considerable funds. I was deputed to attend DGPs’ conference during my Corps Commander tenure in 2013. Over two days, I realised that DGPs carry a fair amount of wisdom but also frustration due to extensive political interference. First the wisdom; in the discussion on mass exodus of NE workforce triggered by a tsunami of WhatsApp messages, Joy Kumar, DGP Manipur and now deputy CM, remarked, “painful but its aftermath of employers recalling their workers was more defining. Mainland needs NE as much as vice versa, this requires amplification.” It reminded me of my experience in 2002, when during Nagaland for Nagas crisis, there were calls to throw outsiders, dubbed as Miyas and Biharis, out. Late DGP Hesse Mao simply said, “last time, we did this, we had famine. It is a question of skill deficit. Till our youth grow out of rentier mindset and agree to toil in cutting edge, sinews of economy, we have no choice.” It administered a life long lesson - there are no migrants, but only guest workers, with mutual dependencies. Back to the DGPs’ conclave, the most prophetic remark was by West Bengal DGP, although off the cuff, “It is only a matter of time, when police will outsmart all other cadres, in all domains, due to growing reliance of politicians on compliant cops. Both will become partners in crime.” I witnessed it in effortless transition of syndicates in Bengal. It seems to be happening post- haste. Prakash Singh Committee has flagged systemic aberrations along with elaborate prescriptive road map. There is rare, but completely predictable, all party consensus to stall the reforms process even before it is started. An India aspiring to be a global power, driven by visions of being ‘Vishwa Guru’ with world class infrastructure, simply can’t deny itself the fundamental necessity of a fair and functional police system. After all, without basic rule of law, how can we even aspire for smart cities? The key driver in this emerging nexus is the comfort that politicians draw in building coteries. The main players, starting as fixers, become master manipulators, few becoming “shooters” operating in the grey zone. Singham-like characters naturally resonate with masses, so we have films on them and Robinhood DGP type of videos in Bhojpuri. My focus is to extend this debate to this dangerous trend of gladiators proliferating into conflict prone areas. Like Vaze, we have had Salwinder (of Pathankot fame) and Devinder (Srinagar airport) and many more. Dubious activities and clairvoyant streak of each of these characters is flagged early in their careers. Notwithstanding this, systems elevates them into key assignments. Even more unfortunate is that in most such cases, the investigation loop never really closes despite prolonged NIA investigations. There is practically no disclosure of findings. Consequently, collaborators and these shadowy characters like David Headley are open to be coerced and redeployed in the dirty, grey-black zone. My first brush with self-appointed gladiator was as Colonel with BSF DIG, who, buoyed by manipulated intelligence, led his troops into killing fields of Sajik Tampak in Manipur. The tendency has only multiplied over the years. In 2015, PS, near Samba was attacked early morning. Army had SF troops in the vicinity, who reacted and localised them. They were best trained to limit casualties but turf centricity and gladiator syndrome kicked in, DIG was taking charge from Jammu. By the time he was on the ground and the operation concluded, it was evening. While he returned in celebratory mode, luckily, Army had braced itself for the long haul. In the morning, four pairs of boots had been spotted at the infiltration site and only two terrorists were eliminated. The next day, the remaining two met their fate, thanks to Naik ‘Tango’ justifiably earning SM. The second was even worse in the same year, when another PS was attacked. The complexity was heightened as unlike Kathua, Dinanagar is not notified as disturbed area. This time, not only was a cordon in place but Hav ‘Sierra with his machine gun had set up the dominating post, knocking down one and injuring another terrorist, out of three ultras. He not only earned the well-deserved SM but the Police also recruited his brother. The twist in the tale was ‘super gladiator’ taking charge. He drove all the way from Chandigarh, once again creating risk of avoidable night operations. Visuals of SWAT, dressed in sports gear were flashed, whereas real heroes were bombers (drill instructors) and brave Home Guards, besides Hav ‘Sierra’. Once again, caution had to be exercised before premature closure of operations to defuse unexploded devices by Army Bomb Disposal teams the next day. The requirements, specially in conflict-prone environment, is to reduce reliance on gladiators and build competence across the board with enough specially trained reaction and special operation teams. It applies equally to all forces. It will only be fair if such teams follow well-defined SOPs under strict over watch protocols and of course, learn to operate in complete anonymity.

---||Amritsar||In Barnala, locals make fire tenders to douse field flames||BATHINDA: In view of incidents of field fires during harvesting, residents of a number of villages in Barnala district have prepared mini fire tenders to douse fire without having to wait for fire tenders. Most of the fire incidents are caused by short circuit, especially near transformers, electric poles or electric wires passing above the fields, farmers said. Gurjit Singh, a fire officer from Barnala taught village residents how to use fire tenders in cases of emergency. The fire tenders are tractor driven, with an iron body having the capacity to store a large quantity of water, about 5,000 to 6,000 litres, as per the size of the tanks. The 150-feet long pipe is fitted to the tank. The water tanker is attached to an engine to pull water with pressure. Nearly Rs 3 lakh has been spent on preparing one tanker. “The mini fire tenders have been prepared by residents of Dhaula, Rureke, Kahneke and Pakho villages, among others. The fire tenders were made due to the many fire incidents reported in these villages in the last wheat harvesting season, when many farmers had to face losses as fire tenders took time reaching fields,” said Khushwinder Singh, a farmer from Dhaula village. Fire officer Gurjit Singh said the mini fire tenders are expected to be highly useful in case of an emergency. Villagers have been told about the technique to effectively use the firer tenders, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/tractors-for-fire-tenders-diy-in-punjabs-barnala-district-villagers-save-wheat-by-innovating/articleshow/82011936.cms||Neel Kamal

With another death, the toll in the state capital reached 645 ever since the virus claimed its first casualty. Till now, 57334 have been diagnosed with the infection and 51601 have recovered in the city. “Public health infrastructure can handle the surge the case. Contingencies are in place. For instance, there are more than 1000 ICU beds in Bhopal. Nearly 25% of ICU beds are unoccupied. As for oxygen supported beds, the supply can easily meet the demand,” said Bhopal chief medical and health officer (CMHO) Dr Padmakar Tripathi. District administration is looking at expansion of Covid-19 care beds in two private hospitals. Around 1000 beds can be added to enhance their capacity. It would place Bhopal with more than 10,000 beds to cater to Covid-19 patients. According to sources, district administration is mooting creating a portal with a dashboard that shows availability of ICU and Covid-19 beds. A similar feature was functional last year, but has since gone offline. Observers also point to the lack of transparency on the part of some hospitals on availability of ICU beds. Instances of people being refused treatment as a result have been cited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-75-icu-beds-occupied-more-to-be-added-officials/articleshow/82011796.cms||Jamal Ayub

Trolleys with provisions for fans, air coolers and even air conditioners were already being sent to the borders. Most recently, 50 cots were been prepared at Longowal in Sangrur, and then sent to Tikri border on April 4. By pooling money, two villages have also provided refrigerators and another a washing machine. Women from Longowal prepared the cots in two days. “In high temperature, sleeping on the road is not easy, so we decided to send the cots for protesters and have prepared 50 so far. Women from the village contributed by knitting the cots. Each cot cost nearly Rs 1,400. These were sent in a truck,” said farm organisation BKU (Ekta Ugrahgan) Longowal unit president Buta Singh. He said though they had initially decided to prepare folding cots, which take less space, they found these were not as durable as flat cots, which are also more comfortable. Earlier, during winter, pinnis and gajrela were sent in large quantities from various villages to keep protesters warm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ground-at-protest-too-got-women-from-punjab-village-send-50-cots-to-tikri-life-farmers-up/articleshow/82011950.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Noida||Bhangel elevated rd to have exits on Vishwakarma Marg||Noida: In a major development that will benefit lakhs of Noida residents, it has been decided that the Bhangel elevated road will have direct access from Vishwakarma Marg, which has now become one of the city’s busiest traffic arteries. The Noida Authority has started work on finalising the cost estimates for building two loops at the intersection. The six-lane elevated road is being built between Aghapur and NSEZ turn in Sector 82. Due to the presence of busy markets in Aghapur, Chhalera, Barola, Salapur and Bhangel, it currently takes 45-60 minutes to reach the NSEZ turn from Noida Golf Course. So, in June 2020, the Authority started work on building a Rs 468 crore worth 4.5km-long elevated road to bring down the commute time to half between the two ends. As the work progressed, residents of 7X and 100-107 sectors started raising demands of linking Vishwakarma Marg with the elevated road keeping in mind the rapid vehicular population growth in the city. The Authority subsequently hired a consultant to study the traffic pattern at the intersection. However, constructing direct ramps was not possible there due to the presence of markets around the intersection. The consultant was asked to check the feasibility of exit and entry loops. Authority CEO Ritu Maheshwari said the project is progressing as per the timeline. “The elevated road will be connected to Vishwakarma Marg. The decision has been taken and the contractor executing the work will be asked to build the extended portion,” she said. The two loops will extend up to a 300-metre distance from the elevated road. While in 7X sectors, the loop will touch base at Vishwakarma Marg near the Hanuman Murti, in 100-107 sectors it will land near Sunworld Vanalika apartment. According to officials involved in preparing the latest design, an additional amount of Rs 22-25 crore will be required to construct two entry and two exit loops on both sides of Vishwakarma Marg. The connectivity was sought by the residents since Vishwakarma Marg is an arterial route that connects Noida-Greater Noida Expressway on one end with the Delhi-Meerut Expressway on the other side close to the Model Town underpass in Ghaziabad. Moreover, at least three dozen highrises have come up in 7X and 100-107 sectors and lakhs of people staying in these complexes use the route to reach Greater Noida, Ghaziabad, Delhi and other parts of NCR via the DND Flyway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/bhangel-elevated-rd-to-have-exits-on-vishwakarma-marg/articleshow/82010338.cms||Shalabh

The lockdown from 6 pm on April 9 to 6 am on April 19 has been imposed in the two areas where nearly 40% of the total active Covid-19 patients belong to, official sources said. As a preventive measure, district administration has imposed the lockdown in these areas for 10 days. Lockdown has also been imposed in other areas of the city but it is only effective till 6 am on April 11 i.e. till Monday but in these two areas, it will remain effective till 6 am on April 19. “The main objective of lockdown in these areas was to restrict the movement of the people to put a break on spread of infection. And intensive vaccination will also be carried out in these areas, all possible measures like identifying beneficiaries calling them, etc will be adopted in these areas”, chief medical and health officer, Bhopal, Dr Prabhakar Tiwari told TOI. “Door to door thermal scanning of the entire area will not be done but it will be carried out in identified pockets. Several other measures will also be taken as and when required”, said Dr Tiwari. Vaccination of the people aged above 45 years — including elderly aged above 60 years and also those with co-morbidities — is going on in the state. A special vaccination campaign is also being conducted by district administration between April 11 and April 14, wherein camps will be organised in the residential colonies of the city, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/door-to-door-screening-in-some-pockets-of-covid-hotspots-shahpura-kolar/articleshow/82011948.cms||Amarjeet Singh

Just a handful of the 1.2 lakh depositors have received their money while the remaining, who had more than Rs 10,000 saved up in their bank accounts are yet to receive the funds, said Joseph Carneiro, a depositor. On February 1, the DICGC had granted an in-principle approval to the liquidator, former finance secretary Daulat Hawaldar, to release Rs 7 crore to traceable depositors having a claim amount of less than Rs 10,000. Subsequently, on March 2, DICGC permitted Mapusa Urban Cooperative Bank officials to release Rs 149.3 crore to single account holders who had more than Rs 10,000 in their accounts. The final tranche of Rs 72.2 crore was cleared for disbursal to 5,687 account holders later in March but till date, these funds have not reached their accounts sparking concerns among the depositors who have been distraught ever since the bank license was cancelled on April 16, 2020. Carneiro also said that those who received their money back were not paid interest for the last five years. Chartered accountants and auditors appointed by DICGC had scrutinised the claims filed by all the depositors before giving the all clear for funds to be disbursed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/most-mapusa-urban-account-holders-still-awaiting-money/articleshow/82010358.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||‘People took the virus casually’||With the active caseload crossing the 5,000-mark in Ranchi and count continues to surge, public health expert and professor of community medicine at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences Dr Dewesh Kumar speaks to TOI’s Gaurav Pandey over the steep surge and the probable reasons behind it. Excerpts: What is the reason behind the sudden rise in cases? Our collective negligence as a community has contributed to the surge. People took the virus casually and lowered their guard despite warnings from the government and doctors. Ranchi alone has 49% of the total active cases of state. Why is this city affected badly? It is not only about Ranchi. In any large urban settlement you will see the situation is worsening. This is because of two things. Firstly, it is the population density and the presence of mutant strains, which can reach cities easily than rural areas. How can one be sure that there is a mutant strain at work in Jharkhand? There is no question that it is the same Wuhan virus which the whole world experienced. We have come a long way from there. Already there are 733 different kinds of mutant strains identified in India. Don’t you think with so much of movement the strains have landed here long back? What do you have to say about the high positivity rate and how infectious is the virus now? There is no doubt that the virus is highly infectious as it has undergone several changes in the last one year. It is understood that the second wave will be for a shorter time, but it will bring more mortality and more severity as the virus adapts and changes its behaviour. How helpful is the vaccination drive amid the second wave? Vaccination is a real boon for us and it is helping us reduce mortality among the vulnerable population as healthcare workers, frontline workers and senior citizens have been prioritised. Things would have been worse if we wouldn’t have inoculated them first. Even if they fall prey to the virus, the severity will be way less than what we experienced when the pandemic had started. When can we expect the peak of the second wave and what will be your word of caution? We will be hitting peak around the third week of April. People shouldn’t take the virus casually and appropriate Covid behaviour and vaccination is the way ahead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/people-took-the-virus-casually/articleshow/82009630.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Kolkata||4 die in CISF firing on bloodiest day of polling||Cooch Behar/Kolkata: Five persons died in Cooch Behar’s Sitalkuchi in poll violence — four of them after a CISF unit fired on a mob — making Saturday’s fourth phase of polling the bloodiest so far in Bengal’s ongoing eight-phase assembly election. Several others, including a 14-year-old boy, were injured in the incident in which the four villagers died. The Election Commission has countermanded the vote at booth number 126 after a report from special observer Vivek Dube. The first victim of Saturday’s violence was 18-year-old Ananda Burman, who was shot by two bike-borne miscreants as he stepped out of a polling booth after casting the first vote of his life. Cooch Behar superintendent of police Debasish Dhar said Burman died before he could be taken to hospital. The Trinamool and the BJP blamed each other for the death. Two persons were arrested and the EC sought a report on the incident. Burman’s death occurred around 9am and seemed to set the tone for the rest of the day. Trouble started 45 minutes later at Amtali Madhyamik Shiksha Kendra, about 15 kilometres away, after 14-year-old Md Manik collapsed near the polling booth. Villagers said his mother asked him to wait outside before stepping in to vote. Three neighbourhood women tried to revive Manik when CISF personnel guarding the booth stepped out to check what the commotion was about. The CISF personnel apparently asked about the boy’s health and offered to shift him to a hospital, reports reaching the EC office in Kolkata suggested. But, according to another account, a section of villagers alleged that the boy was injured after being assaulted by CISF personnel. Around 350 people gathered in no time and the mob attacked CISF personnel, including unit head Sunil Kumar, a 32-year-old home guard, two poll officers and an ASHA worker. The mob reportedly tried to snatch firearms from the CISF personnel, prompting the latter to call for reinforcements. A quick response team tried to reach the spot but was reportedly stopped by locals and their vehicle was ransacked. Reports reaching Kolkata said the CISF personnel fired two rounds in the air but — as it failed to disperse the crowd — they fired seven rounds in “self-defence”, leading to the deaths. “Primary investigations revealed the force opened fire in self-defence after a few from the mob tried to snatch their firearms,” deputy inspector-general (Jalpaiguri range) E Annapa said. Dhar corroborated this. “They were overpowered and fired in self-defence,” he said. Reports sent to the EC, too, cited “self-defence” as the reason for firing. But a report released by Border Security Force South Bengal inspector-general and CAPF nodal officer for Bengal A K Singh differed in some details. This report, shared with the media, said firing took place twice. The first happened when 50-60 people attacked a CISF patrol team when “they were taking a round of the area along with local police representative to clear people who were resisting voters from reaching polling booths”. “One child fell in the melee and miscreants started damaging the unit vehicle and attacked personnel. The team reacted in self-defence and fired six rounds in the air to disperse the mob,” this report said. The second incident, this report said, took place around 10.30am. Around 150 people returned to attack booth number 126, assaulted poll officials and CISF personnel and tried to snatch away their firearms. Security forces initially fired two rounds in the air and, after that, seven more rounds at the advancing mob. The dead were identified as Chhalmu Mia, Jobed Ali, Amzad Hossain and Nameed Mia. The injured were identified as Binoy Barman (bullet injury), Alomgir Alom, Monirul Haque, home guard Debabrata Das, polling officials Dilip Majumder and Avijit Barman and ASHA worker Minati Roy Barman. The BSF report suggested the police, too, fired at the mob though superintendent of police Dhar denied any firing by state police personnel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/4-die-in-cisf-firing-on-bloodiest-day-of-polling/articleshow/82010497.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya

Jitendra Prasad, who owns Kamal Catering and Tent House, said, “After almost no work for the most part of last year, the new year had brought some hope and just when things were looking good on the work front, Covid cases started recording a spike and now customers are calling to either postpone their weddings or curtail their work orders. A few families have postponed their marriage to November, citing that it would be difficult to invite only 200 people. They opined that even if they invite only their close friends and relatives, the total number of guests would exceed 200. ” Those that have decided to go ahead with the wedding with a curtailed guest list have pruned their decorations and decided to go for a low-key ceremony minus the opulence. “This will naturally affect the hundreds of labourers who spend days erecting lavish pandals adorned with flowers, lights, etc.,” Sambhu Gupta of Sai Decorators said. A florist named Pradeep Sarkar said that he had already paid an advance to his labourers in Kolkata based on the initial bookings. “However, now the clients are approaching me with reduced budget for decorations. We will face losses if we go ahead with the bookings but the advance given in this regard will not be returned,” he added. Subhendu Kumar of Kanha Tent House said, “After almost no work last year, we were expecting a turnaround this time. The rise in Covid cases has, however, dashed our hopes. With smaller functions, the orders for tents, catering and decoration will be less, which would directly affect our earnings.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/caterers-florists-stare-at-losses-as-customers-curtail-spending-postpone-weddings/articleshow/82009645.cms||Sanjay Sahay

The move, the district health machinery said, is aimed at keeping a record of the Covid-19 deaths. “Private hospitals have to share timely data so that the daily Covid-19 bulletin contains the latest update,” district additional chief medical officer Dr Sahir Pall said. The move comes after a city-based private hospital allegedly did not report two Covid deaths on time to the district health department on Thursday. As a result, the deaths did not feature in the daily Covid-19 bulletin on that particular day. IMA Jamshedpur general secretary Dr Mrityunjay Singh said, “Shortage of manpower in some hospitals is also a reason for the delay in compilation of data.” Singh said transparency in data was important to keep a track of the second wave of the pandemic. A junior official in the district health department on condition of anonymity said the issue of shortage of manpower is there in the department as well. “Although data from private hospitals arrive on time, it takes a while for compilation,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/e-sbhum-admin-asks-pvt-hosps-to-report-cov-deaths-on-time/articleshow/82009639.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Mamata blames Shah for deaths, demands resignation||Siliguri/Kolkata: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday demanded the resignation of Union home minister Amit Shah, accusing him of a conspiracy in the Sitalkuchi CISF firing that caused four deaths, and said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had “justified” the violence by giving the central forces a clean chit. Banerjee also ordered a CID probe into the incident. “The police may be under the Election Commission, but I am still the chief minister,” she said, adding voters being killed was “the murder of democracy itself”. Banerjee also questioned the “self-defence” justification by police and central forces. “Has anyone (among the central forces) been injured? Why isn’t there any video footage?” she asked, adding, “I have repeatedly said that the central forces are working under political instructions from Delhi.” She said she did not blame the central forces for the incident. “They are working under the Union home minister’s instructions. There is an undeclared presidents’ rule in Bengal,” the CM said, adding, “The Election Commission has changed the top officers responsible for law and order — the DGP and ADG (law and order). Even the Cooch Behar SP was replaced. No panel was sought from the state.” Questioning the role of special police observer Vivek Dube, who has reported to the EC that the firing was in self-defence, Banerjee said: “Why is this retired officer sent to Bengal during every election? Yesterday, they (the EC) removed an officer from my CMO because he had retired two months back. Why is the rule different for him (Dube)? Is the country bereft of efficient officers?” Earlier, at public meetings in North 24 Parganas, she directly blamed Shah for being a “conspirator” in the deaths. “Voters ke guli kore marchhe, ki onnay korechhilo era? (They are shooting voters dead; what wrong had they done?) Even after killing, they say self defence,” she said, adding, “Amit Shah, you must resign. As the home minister, you are a conspirator. I have repeatedly been saying that I am not against the CRPF, but they are torturing women in the villages. And today you open fire on voters standing in a queue. Where do they get this audacity? So many people didn’t die even in the panchayat elections (in Bengal). Will you vote for people who shoot and kill people? BJP has lost completely (in Bengal). They know they are not winning. So, their only weapon is to open fire and scare people.” The CM said the BJP was killing people using self-defence as an excuse. “They have no shame,” she said. “In this conspiracy, the home minister is using the EC to make the CRPF commit crimes. I would urge you not to be scared and avenge this by voting for Trinamool Congress,” she added. “Amar panch-ta bhai ke mere bolchhe, grambasi ra naki bonduk karte eschilo, lojja kore na? (After killing five brothers of mine you say the villagers were trying to snatch your guns, have you no shame?)” the CM said, responding to initial claims by the EC and Cooch Behar police — also cited by BJP — that villagers had attacked the CISF unit, prompting them to fire in “self-defence”. “These deaths need to be avenged with votes, else their souls will never get peace,” she said. “Vivek Dube who are you? I am asking the EC, you can send me notice, but I am not violating any code of conduct; I am just asking about my democratic rights. Twelve Trinamool Congress workers have been killed (since polls were announced in Bengal).” Mocking the BJP’s “achhe din” slogan, Banerjee said, “BJP’r achhe din mane guli kore mere din (BJP’s good days means shoot and kill). The more people they kill, the more people are going to vote against them to avenge the deaths. I appeal to you to avenge this attempt to murder democracy by your votes. BJP is shameless. Their PM has no shame either. He is saying that the firing was right. He gives a clean chit (to the security forces who fired). Can they be forgiven? BJP should have a little shame.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mamata-blames-shah-for-deaths-demands-resignation/articleshow/82010499.cms||Roshan Gupta
---||Kolkata||Have highest regard for CAPF, Didi replies to EC show-cause notice||Kolkata: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, while replying on Saturday to the Election Commission’s sho-w-cause notice over her alleged remarks against central forces, said she had the “highest regard” for CAPF. Banerjee praised the contribution of central forces towards the safety of the nation, but in the same breath explained her stand. “An incident shocked me when in the early hours of April 6, 2021, at Ramnagar in Tarakeswar, a little girl was molested by an unidentified CRPF man. It was reported to police.” A complaint was also lodged with the chief electoral officer of Bengal. “Unfortunately, till date, no tangible action has been taken or at least an advisory or instruction issued by the EC to CAPF... Further, during the first, second and third phase of polls in Bengal, there have been serious allegations that CAPF is resorting to intimidation of voters by exerting force, influencing them to cast votes for a particular political party,” she wrote. According to Banerjee, during the first, second and third phases, Trinamool lodged six, 18 and 134 complaints, “but only a few were redressed”. No tangible steps have been taken by the EC against such CAPF personnel and/or their hierarchy, the CM wrote. “On the contrary, on frivolous complaints by BJP, the DGP, director of security of Bengal, ADG (law and order), ADG West Zone and numerous SPs, DCs, DSPs and inspectors of Midnapore, Alipurduar, Diamond Harbour, Howrah Rural, Cooch Behar were removed by the EC.” Referring to her comments in Cooch Behar on April 7, she quoted herself: “Ladies, a group of you go and restrain (gherao) men while another group will go for casting their votes... This is their plan. It is the plan of the BJP. Your plan will be that you will not be scared if they try to intimidate you... You will talk to them... Talking to them will be tantamount to restraining them. You don’t have to gherao them literally.” Banerjee explained that in her speech, she had only called upon women voters to protest democratically. “If and when somebody (including CAPF) created any obstruction to their right to vote, gherao is one of the accepted democratic ways of registering public protest and there is no reason why gherao should be considered illegal.” The CM further wrote: “Be it noted that the multi-dimensional word ‘gherao’ has been a legitimate entry in the political lexicon of West Bengal since late 1960s, and in recent years, more frequently than not. The word has been used to connote peaceful Satyagraha against authorities by silent victims of a situation. I have only emphasised that voters should exercise their franchise in a free and fair manner and that intimidation of the electorate by any external force whatsoever, including CAPF, will not be tolerated.” Banerjee reiterated that she “emphatically suggested” that the gherao shall be “by way of verbal engagement” and not a literal gherao. “The above is evidence that there has been no attempt to threaten, incite and/or influence the electorate against the CAPF and any allegation to the contrary is unfounded and thus denied. My intentions have all along been to uphold the sanctity of democracy and the spirit of the Constitution. It is clear that I have not violated either the model code of conduct or the Indian Penal Code, 1860, in any manner whatsoever, and thus you will kindly rescind the notice,” she summed up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/have-highest-regard-for-capf-didi-replies-to-ec-show-cause-notice/articleshow/82010100.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Poll panel bars neta entry in district after CM plans visit||Kolkata: The Election Commission late on Saturday barred political “leaders” from visiting the nine assembly segments of Cooch Behar, including Sitalkuchi, for 72 hours. The late-evening order came a few hours after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee announced that she would visit Sitalkuchi’s bereaved families on Sunday. The EC order, which bars political leaders from Cooch Behar till Tuesday evening, will force Banerjee to cancel her plans. No senior Bengal politician except Banerjee had announced plans to visit Cooch Behar till Saturday evening. The EC asked the state chief secretary, the DGP and the Cooch Behar DM and superintendent of police to either go to Sitalkuchi themselves or assign senior officers to ensure its order was not violated. The TMC questioned the fairness of the EC decision banning political leaders from Cooch Behar for 72 hours. Former Union minister Yashwant Sinha said: “The EC has covered itself with mud by stopping the CM from going to Cooch Behar. After all, she is still the CM of Bengal and it is her duty and responsibility to visit the venue of this tragedy. We now know for certain that the EC is not fair.” The EC also issued another order on Saturday, specifying that campaigning for the next (fifth) phase of polling — slated for next Saturday (April 17) — would have to stop 72 hours before polling. The usual campaign-end deadline is 48 hours before polling. As many as 45 assembly seats go to vote on April 17; they include important seats like Jalpaiguri, Kalimpong, Darjeeling, Kurseong, Siliguri in north Bengal and Kamarhati, Baranagar, Dum Dum, Rajarhat New Town, Bidhannagar, Rajarhat Gopalpur, Madhyamgram and Barasat on Kolkata’s northern and eastern fringes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/poll-panel-bars-neta-entry-in-district-after-cm-plans-visit/articleshow/82010505.cms||---

Nanda Naskar was found in a noose in the balcony of his house at Shyamsunder Chak in Bauria, Howrah, in the morning. His family said he had been busy putting up BJP flags till late on Friday. Uluberia police have sent the body for post-mortem. BJP’s Uluberia East candidate Protyush Mondal visited the bereaved family and said Naskar was an active party worker who had been threatened by the Trinamool Congress. The latter has denied the allegation. BJP worker Amar Das, who went missing on Friday evening, was found hanging in a bamboo grove in Cooch Behar’s Patlakhawa in the afternoon. The saffron party blamed the Trinamool for the alleged murder. The TMC denied any involvement, stating the BJP had levelled the same allegation when its worker died by suicide recently in Dinhata.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-workers-found-hanging-in-howrah-cooch-behar/articleshow/82010177.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya

---||Ranchi||Cov virus highly infectious in 2nd wave, many test +ve after 2nd vax dose||RANCHI: Some healthcare and frontline workers, who had taken both shots of the Covid-19 vaccine, have tested positive for the virus in the city recently even as health experts said inoculation is the best way to fight the deadly virus and to reduce the severity of the infection. A few workers, who tested positive after taking completing the vaccination cycle, told TOI that several reasons could be behind their infection but the most probable one is their higher exposure to the virus as they deal with infected patients and the mutation of the virus since the outbreak. A 38-year-old Rims physician, who is now in home isolation, said, “I had taken my second dose of vaccine on March 8 and tested positive on April 4, almost after a month I had completed the inoculation. I have been experiencing high fever and headache for the last four days and will shift to the hospital if the symptoms persist." Similarly, a senior faculty member of Rims, who too has been infected, said he took his final dose about a month ago and got infected three days back. He said, "The infectivity of the virus is way higher than what we had experienced during the first wave as I used to treat Covid-19 patients daily. The severity of the virus this time is less but is highly infectious.” A senior IAS officer from the city, who had worked extensively during the lockdown, was also infected recently. He said, “I along with my wife have tested positive for Covid-19. My oxygen levels are fine but high fever and constant headache are making things worse." Meanwhile, experts said the high infection rate might be due to the mutation of the virus and people need to be very careful. Talking to TOI, professor of pulmonary medicine at Rims, Dr Brajesh Mishra, said, “We get a new vaccine for influenza every year because of the same reason and the vaccines which are being used to inoculate people from Covid-19 are for emergency and restricted use. Having said that, people should get themselves vaccinated as it reduces the severity of a future infection.” On being asked about the reasons the healthcare workers getting infected after completing the inoculation, Mishra said, "The kind of exposure a healthcare or frontline worker experiences is way more than the common public. You never know whether a patient visiting the OPDs are infected or not and you cannot deny treating them. So the chances of getting are very high. Apart from that, we are also noticing that the virus is highly infectious this time as people are getting infected in large numbers. I know a few families where everyone is infected soon after one develops the symptom which was not the situation during the last wave.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cov-virus-highly-infectious-in-2nd-wave-many-test-ve-after-2nd-vax-dose/articleshow/82009617.cms||Gaurav Pandey

There was no exchange of barbs between rivals Becharam Manna of Trinamool Congress and his former mentor Rabindranath Bhattacharya, who switched to the BJP weeks before the elections. Both expressed confidence of winning the coveted seat. Singur witnessed queues outside booths since early morning, with voters exchanging pleasantries regardless of what party they supported. “I didn’t want to miss this crucial vote and decided to join early with other women,” said Urmila Das of Beraberi Purbapara who was in line by 7am. While a posse of central paramilitary and police personnel patrolled the narrow lanes, villagers weren’t the least perturbed. There was no animosity towards the men in uniform. “They are doing their job. We are enjoying our right to vote,” said Malati Ruidas of Beraberi Ruisaspara. Youths turned up in large numbers later in the morning. On Singur Mahamaya School premises, a group of young boys and girls were busy taking selfies as they waited to exercise their franchise around 11am. Ananya Banerjee, a second-year student at Singur Government College, said: “I never thought I would get to study in a college in Singur. But now, we have one and it is all thanks to the government that was voted to power in an election that pivoted around the farmland agitation in Singur.” While assembly polls in 2011 — and to some extent in 2016 — were about farmland, the demand for industry is a key factor in this election. “We had in 2006 given up land hoping our children would get jobs. My son is a graduate who is sitting at home without work. We have cast our vote for industrialisation of Singur,” said Joymolla resident Sk Rashid. Both BJP and the Left have promised an industrial revolution here. Singur, which has 2,46,732 voters on the rolls, recorded a turnout of 78.4% by 5pm. There was no allegation of rigging or intimidation from any of the 236 polling booths in the constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/singur-forgets-animosity-votes-in-peace-for-industry-and-jobs/articleshow/82010154.cms||Falguni Banerjee

Share it in full, Kishor dares party||Kolkata: A few audio clips, purportedly from a chat of poll strategist Prashant Kishor with several journalists on a social media app, erupted controversy on a day Bengal went to the fourth phase of its assembly polls. Kishor, who was heard saying that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is “as popular as” chief minister Mamata Banerjee in Bengal, later dared the BJP to publish the entire chat instead of giving out selected portions. The clips, the content of which TOI couldn’t verify independently, were shared by Bengal BJP co-in charge Amit Malviya through his Twitter handle. “Modi is hugely popular in Bengal, and there is no doubt about it. He is equally popular like Mamata Banerjee,” Kishor was heard saying. Malviya , who tweeted the clips, added: “He went on record on a public platform and conceded that the BJP is winning this election.” The clips said: “The vote is for Modi; polarisation is a reality, the SCs (27% of WB's population), Matuas are all voting for the BJP! BJP has cadre on the ground.” Later, Malviya told mediapersons that such a statement from Banerjee’s advisor after three phases of polling was significant. “What he said there actually sums up what the BJP has been saying all these months,” he said. Malviya also referred to a statement of Sujata Mandal, which PM Modi referred to in his rally. Kishor took a dig at the tweets. “I am glad BJP is taking my chats more seriously than the words of their leaders! They should show courage & share the full chat instead of getting excited with selective use of parts of it. I have said this before & repeating — BJP will not cross 100 in WB.” TMC accused BJP of playing “mind games” and creating a wave for BJP while polling was on. TMC leader Dola Sen said, “He himself answered everything through his tweet. He reiterated that BJP will not get 100 seats in Bengal. BJP understood that Mamata Banerjee will again be chief minister of Bengal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-tweets-chats-share-it-in-full-kishor-dares-party/articleshow/82010124.cms||Rohit Khanna

Officials said the lab was caught "red-handed" while conducting CT scans and chest X-rays of patients even after it was asked to close for three days after one of its staff tested positive for the virus. Talking to TOI about the sealing of the lab, deputy commissioner Uma Shankar Singh said, "We received information that some radiology labs were conducting CT scans and chest X-rays to on patients and were not sharing details of their tests with the IDSP cell. We asked the labs to share the information and details of such persons so that they do not infect others. Later, we directed three labs, including Clinilab, to shut their operations for three days to get their premises sanitized and get their staff tested." He further said after a meeting with the labs on Friday, the administration created a Whatsapp group to share the details but it was found Clinilab was flouting the rules after which senior officials of the district raided it. During the raid, the officials found the lab operating with full staff strength and dozens of reports of scans and X-rays conducted were recovered. Singh added that the officials also requested the patients present at the lab to get themselves tested. Meanwhile, the administration continued with its checking drive on Saturday and detained 52 people for not wearing masks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/pvt-lab-sealed-for-violating-cov-rules-in-dhanbad/articleshow/82009621.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Mamata Banerjee’s ‘instigation’ led to mob-CISF face-off: PM Modi||SILIGURI: PM Narendra Modi on Saturday put the entire blame for the Sitalkuchi deaths on Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and accused her of instigating the TMC’s “chhappa vote” gang to confront security forces. “What happened was very sad. My condolences to the bereaved families. Didi and her goondas are stooping so low because they are perturbed by the increasing support for the BJP,” Modi said a couple of hours after the CISF firing. The PM appealed to the Election Commission to take “strong action” against the culprits. “I would like to tell Didi that this violence cannot save you. Didi has started training her chhappa vote gang in open rallies on how to confront security forces, beat them and disturb the poll process,” he said at the Siliguri rally, 140km from the scene of the deaths. “Didi is angry with security forces but has nothing against extortionists and terrorists. Didi is angry because her goons are not being able to cast chhappa like they did during the 2018 panchayat polls,” Modi said. He then referred to the “threats” by state tourism minister Gautam Deb to voters in Dabgram-Fulbari (without naming Deb), adjacent to Siliguri, as an example of “Trinamool arrogance”. “A video has gone viral showing a minister threatening eviction if people vote for the BJP. Do you approve of this arrogance? Can I as PM say this to people?” the PM asked. He referred to another video showing a Trinamool leader “insulting” Scheduled Castes. “The video shows a Trinamool leader saying the SC community is behaving like beggars. It shows how they despise SC people. The party is upset with this community because the latter support the BJP,” he added. “Didi says you all came to this rally after being paid. This is an insult to your self-respect,” Modi said. “You can defeat the BJP but how will you beat people?” he asked Banerjee. Modi asked what people had got from the Trinamool government. “Did Didi give you land deeds. Did she implement forest rights for forest dwellers? Did she help revise wages of tea garden workers? She could not provide you piped drinking water and irrigation for farmlands but handed over rivers to the sand mafia,” Modi said. The PM assured women that the BJP, after assuming office, would transfer all benefits without “cut money”. “Didi asks what’s the big deal if someone takes Rs 100-Rs 200 from people. It’s time for Didi to go and, along with her, all the extortionists and syndicates. The next government will remove all these negative forces that have got a boost during the Trinamool regime. A BJP government will protect your rights and identity,” he promised. Modi, at another rally in Krishnanagar later on Saturday, said even the minority community that the Bengal CM had wooed was in “distress”. “That is why she needs to appeal to them continuously,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/didis-instigation-led-to-mob-cisf-face-off-modi/articleshow/82010502.cms||Roshan Gupta

While on a raid, the Bihar police team was gheraoed by villagers and assaulted at Pantapara under Goalpokhor police station.  Inspector-in-charge of Kishanganj police station, Ashwini Kumar (50), died in the scuffle. On Friday night, the Kishanganj police came to Panjipara police outpost in connection with a raid to recover stolen motorcycles, it was learnt. However, Panjipara outpost was unable to provide manpower at the time and the Bihar cops conducted the raid at Pantapara by themselves. They were in three vehicles, the first of which was a civilian one. As the cars entered the village at midnight, scared residents raised a cry, mistaking them for miscreants. The policemen tried to convince them, but were surrounded and assaulted. Kumar lost consciousness in the clash. Later, a huge force from Islampore along with officers raided the village. Kumar was taken to Islampore Hospital, where he was declared dead. A postmortem is being conducted and North Dinajpur district magistrate Arabinda Kumar Meena has ordered a magisterial probe. Bihar police officers went to Islampore on Saturday morning. Suresh Prasad Choudhury, IG of Purnia Range Bihar Police, said: “Kishanganj police had specific information regarding a motorcycle-lifter ga-ng and they came to arrest them. But the inspector was lynched by villagers.” Sachin Makkar, police superintendent of Islampore, said: “Kishangunj police raided the village Pantapara and they were gheraoed by the mob. Prima facie, it appeared that there was a scuffle and the inspector died. However, the cause of death will be known once we get the postmortem report.” Makkar added: “Three persons were arrested and they will be produced in court tomorrow (Sunday).” The arrested include Firoz Alam, whose house was going to be raided, his brother Abuzar Alam and his mother Shahinur Khatun. The SP said: “On the basis of their interrogation, more people may be arrested.” Watch Bihar cop lynching: Three accused arrested, seven police officers suspended||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bihar-cop-lynched-during-raid-at-bengal-village/articleshow/82010142.cms||Subhro Maitra

On Saturday, several milk parlours that also sell items like eggs and breads others have exhausted them and on Sunday, except milk, citizens may not get other products. Vendors would be able to resume selling of such products from Monday. On day one of the lockdown, much problem was not witnessed in getting basic items like breads and biscuits. Shopkeepers said citizens had bought items in large numbers due to which they exhausted several items. “I had brought bread and eggs almost double in strength compared to other days at my shop. Most of the items were exhausted even in the morning. I will not be able to supply such products on Sunday. This is the problem with almost every milk parlour,” said a shopkeeper in MP Nagar area. Same problem was witnessed in other parts of the state capital also. “I was not expecting such a quick sale on day one of the lockdown. Now, I will be able to sell milk only. For other products citizens will have to wait till Monday,” said another shopkeeper Ghanshyam in BHEL area.

Government has procured the injections directly from the manufacturer and around 35000 more are being tendered, they said. The announcement comes on the backdrop of reports of shortage of the combinatory treatment of Covid-19 treatment with Remdesivir. Officials said that an estimated 10% of the patients who are critically ill are administered the infection. They have formed teams at the district level to monitor illegal hoarding or improper and unadvised used of the antiviral medication. On Saturday morning, Bhopal chemist association representative, Lalit Jain said that an estimated 10,000 injections are needed and supply is less than 10% of requirement from Indore depot. The rate of one injection is pegged at Rs 1200 to Rs 1600. The drug has a potential therapeutic strategy to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection success and to limit deleterious Covid-19 outcomes. However, the translation of in-vitro results into the clinics remains a major challenge. Although pharmacokinetic and safety profiles for these drugs are available, combined medications bear the risk of drug–drug interactions which may lead to reduced therapeutic benefit or even severe adverse effects, according to recent studies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-to-get-50000-vials-of-remdesivir/articleshow/82012030.cms||---

But the little boy was not disheartened, instead, he went over to a neighbour and offered to work as a domestic help to fund his schooling. Since then, he has been juggling odd jobs to stay on course. The journey ended on a high note on Saturday when Niyaz, now 29, was awarded PhD in commerce for his paper, Role of cooperative banking in socio-economic development of rural Muslim communities — A study in DK district of Karnataka), at the 39th convocation of Mangalore University. His father, despite ailments, worked as a daily wage labourer while his mother Zubaida rolled beedis to look after the couple’s eight children — four girls and four boys. “I am the youngest and always wanted to become a teacher. I knew poverty would stand in my way, so I was ready to work for a living from childhood itself,” said Niyaz, a resident of Panakaje, Belthangady. From selling fish to working as a mason and an auto driver, he has done many jobs. “In class one, I was a domestic help in a neighbour’s house, then took up work related to building rings for wells,” he recalled. In high school and PU, Niyaz worked in paddy fields and delivered newspapers. Niyaz completed his M.Com at St Agnes College. He enrolled for PhD in 2016 under Abbokar Siddiq, associate professor and coordinator at the department of PG studies in commerce, University College, Mangaluru. “I was entitled to a scholarship of Rs 25,000 but it was never credited on time. Hence, for the first two years of my PhD, I sold fish in Madanthyar and transported to Kerala. I also worked as a mason,” he said. The odd jobs never affected Niyaz’s college time. He was regular to his Phd studies and completed it in five years. In college, he worked as an auto driver from 7 to 9 in the morning and 4-8 in the evening. During his MCom days, Niyaz was a receptionist in two lodges. Niyaz has presented over 25 research papers so far and is an assistant professor of commerce at Srinivas University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/karnataka-he-sold-fish-worked-as-mason-to-earn-phd/articleshow/82012039.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

---||Bhopal||Active cases may rise to 1 lakh, but we’ll stop it, says Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan||BHOPAL: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Saturday said that the number of active Covid-19 cases in the state might reach one lakh April end. “The way there is a spike in coronavirus infection cases, the number of active cases in MP may reach one lakh by the end of this month. We will try to stop this in the middle as we have started adopting some measures, including lockdowns,” he said. Active cases in Madhya Pradesh are high at 30,486 while the number of deaths due to the virus are at 4136, as per the government figures. Chouhan said the state government has decided to open Covid care centres in all the districts due to the rise in cases. In Bhopal and in Indore, a team is looking for government buildings which could be converted into Covid care centres. The supply of oxygen for medical purposes has been maintained in the state, he said. Three days ago, 60 metric tonne oxygen was being made available. On Friday 180 metric tonne was supplied. On shortage of Remdesivir injection that is used in the treatment of coronavirus patients, he said one lakh Remdesivir injections will be made available in the state every month. Orders for 50000 Remdesivir injections have been issued for patients and the supply has also started. One lakh beds are being arranged in the state. CT scan will be arranged in all district hospitals, he said. “We mainly get the supply of oxygen from Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and a small amount from Maharashtra. We have also started getting it from Bhilai (Chhattisgarh) steel plant,” Chouhan said. Oxygen should be used judiciously and as per requirement, the chief minister said. Chouhan said the state government is also making arrangements for ventilators. Chouhan appealed to the people to stay at home and avoid venturing out unnecessarily to help stop the spread of the virus. A day earlier, Chouhan had said strict action will be taken against the black marketing of oxygen, hospitals charging above the prescribed rate for screening and treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/active-cases-may-rise-to-1-lakh-but-well-stop-it-says-madhya-pradesh-cm-shivraj-singh-chouhan/articleshow/82012043.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka cracks whip on transport employees, detains their leader||BENGALURU: The Karnataka government cracked down on the RTC employees’ strike on Saturday, the fourth day of the stir, by arresting Kodihalli Chandrashekar and dismissing some trainees who refused to report to work.  The move comes a day after the government invoked provisions of the Karnataka Industrial Disputes Act against the ongoing agitation. Police detained Kodihalli Chandrashekar, who is leading the stir, soon after he landed in Belagavi as part of his tour to meet employees and motivate them to continue their protest without fear. He was detained when he was about to address a press conference, prior to addressing a group of employees. The government also transferred around 656 staff including drivers, conductors, controllers, depot managers and technical staff from one division to another besides dismissing 32 trainee staff for refusing to report to duty. The action was to instil fear among the staff to return to work. While the tough stand of the government has forced the staff to resolve to intensify their strike, a section of employees started to report to duty. Transport minister Laxman Savadi said around 1,400 RTC buses hit the roads by Saturday afternoon. Though the number is not even 5% of RTC’s total fleet, it signifies some improvement in situation. Employees of all the four RTCs are participating in the strike. Chandrashekar was elected as the honorary president last year to lead the agitation of RTC employees and negotiate with the government for the implementation of the Sixth Pay Commission. He had also led a four-day strike in December last year, in which he had succeeded in getting a written assurance from the Yediyurappa government stating that it will “look positively into implementation of Sixth Pay Commission recommendation to transport staff”. The assurance included a deadline too. Police in Belagavi said that Chandrashekar was detained as he had not taken permission to hold rallies there or take part in protests. Labour dept intervenes, prohibits indefinite strike by employeesChandrashekar, however, termed his detention as illegal. “The government is trying to suppress the strike by using force. But the protest will continue till the demand made by the employees is met,” he added. Citing the inconvenience caused to commuters across the state, the state labour department intervened and prohibited the indefinite strike by employees of the road transport corporations with immediate effect and also referred the wage dispute to the Karnataka Wage Dispute Tribunal. Wage demand turned downThe government has also turned down the demand for higher wages citing financial stress, besides refusing to even hold talks with the striking employees. “When we have said the demand cannot be met, what is the point in holding talks,” chief minister B S Yeddyurappa had said while appealing the staff to end their strike. HDK asks BSY to step inJD(S) legislature party chief and former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy warned that Yediyurappa would pay a heavy price for neglecting transport employees. “It’s been four days since the protest started but the CM has made no efforts to bring the staff to the negotiation table. This stand has aggravated the situation besides putting people into hardship. I request the CM to immediately invite protesting staff and resolve their issues,” he said. Meanwhile, deputy CM Laxman Savadi objected to Congress support for the strike and sought to know why the party did not implement the 6th Pay Commission recommendations when it was in power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-cracks-whip-on-transport-employees-detains-their-leader/articleshow/82012051.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Covid-positive youth rushed to 3 hospitals for ventilator, dies||BENGALURU: A 31-year-old, Covid-positive man died in the wee hours of Saturday in Bengaluru after he was rushed to three hospitals in search of a ventilator. While the BBMP has initiated a probe, the death is a pointer to the shortage of beds for seriously ill patients. The patient, a resident of Padmanabhanagar, tested positive on April 9 and was in home isolation. He developed acute hypoxia (oxygen deprivation) on Friday evening and was taken to Bhagwan Mahaveer Jain Hospital in Vasanthnagar around 8.30pm in a private ambulance. Mercy Mission, an NGO working on the Covid front, helped the family book an ICU bed through the 108 Arogya Kavacha ambulance service. By the time, he reached the hospital, there was no ICU bed available and the family sought a bed in the Girinagar branch of the hospital. The booking was again done through 108. BBMP issues showcause notice to hospWhen he reached there, his oxygen saturation level was 40% as against the normal 95%. He was treated at a high dependency unit and put on oxygen support. “While his oxygen saturation level initially improved, it fell to single digits despite giving 12 litres of oxygen. He was required to be on a ventilator, but we didn’t have a ventilator bed vacant. His condition was worsening,” said Dr Reshma S, unit head, Bhagwan Mahaveer Jain hospital, Girinagar branch. Around 1am Saturday, he was moved to a private hospital near Koramangala but died around 4am. While the patient’s family was not available for comment, Dr (Wing Commander) MD Marker, medical director, Bhagwan Mahaveer Jain Hospital (Vasanthnagar) said by the time the patient came, the ventilator beds were full. “On Friday evening, we had two sick patients brought in requiring ICU treatment. This patient came around 9pm. We could not have removed the life support system of one patient to accommodate the patient referred by BBMP,” he said. BBMP Chief Health Officer Dr BK Vijendra said: “We have sought details and inquiring into the case.” Authorities at 108 ambulance service said they only did bed blocking for the patient and he was not ferried in a ventilator-fitted ambulance. BBMP issued a showcause notice to Bhagwan Mahaveer Jain Hospital, Vasanthnagar, asking why the patient was denied a bed even though the booking was done through the centralised hospital bed management system .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-covid-positive-youth-rushed-to-3-hospitals-for-ventilator-dies/articleshow/82012078.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Bengaluru||Two health staffers caught faking swab collection in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: At a time when the central government has called for a stronger Covid-19 testing effort, civic officials in Bengaluru are contending with a fraud.  Two swab collectors were dismissed on Saturday after they were seen in a video packing swabs into labbound containers without taking actual samples. A medical officer was also suspended over the incident. “They were sending these swabs to laboratories for testing without collecting throat or nasal samples of people, mainly those who come to hospitals with symptoms. This casts doubts on the claims made by BBMP that more tests are being conducted in the city every day,” said a senior government official. The case of fake sample collection took place at the Kodigehalli primary health centre (PHC) near Yelahanka. The two swab collectors, Nagaraj and Mohan, were working on contract. In a 54-second video that went viral, Nagaraj is seen asking another person to turn on the camera, record everything and share it with senior officials and on Facebook. He says he is not scared and knows how to handle the situation. The clip shows Nagaraj and Mohan putting swab sticks back into tiny containers without taking actual samples. Other staff members at the PHC laugh. “We cannot justify such action. We have taken action against them and ordered an inquiry,” said BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta. Senior civic officials sought to assure the public that this was an isolated case. The incident came to light two days ago and an initial inquiry found that the two men were sending bottles without real samples to the National Centre For Biological Sciences for testing. At the lab, 12 Covid-19 test reports were termed inconclusive, i.e. not positive or negative. Earlier, Nagaraj worked as a helper at a private hospital. He lost that job last year. Six months ago, he and Mohan underwent training to collect swab samples for the civic body. BBMP health officer (Yelahanka) Dr Bhagyalakshmi said that the entire zone had a target of conducting 6,500 tests every day and there were 10 PHCs there. The Kodigehall PHC is required to conduct 650 tests every day. She said that police were investigating how the two men generated specimen referral form ID and whose phone numbers they wrote while sending the samples to the laboratory. Police have registered a case under sections 177 (fur nishing false infor mation) and 408 (criminal breach of trust by clerk or servant) of the Indian Penal Code. The two men have not been arrested yet. Some BBMP employees say that there is tremendous pressure on them to increase testing in the wake of the second wave. To date, BBMP says it has conducted 95,37,287 tests. On average, 60,000 tests are carried out daily after infections started to spike again in March this year. As of Friday, Yelahanka zone has 17 containment zones, which includes apartment complexes. Of the 2,058 positive cases reported in seven days, 333 were shifted to hospitals or Covid care centres and 1,717 are in home isolation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/two-health-staffers-caught-faking-swab-collection-in-bengaluru/articleshow/82012109.cms||Kiran Parashar

From April 1 to 8, the civic body has received Rs 3.02 crore as property tax, the payment for which has come from almost all modes like e-Sampark centres, banks, and online. A majority of the taxpayers have preferred e-Sampark centres to make the payment. Residential properties are ahead of commercial properties in the initial phase. According to the records of the MC, a total of 7,145 taxpayers of residential properties have made the payment of over Rs 2 crore. Around Rs 1 crore has come from 1,460 commercial properties. “Till April 8,we received Rs 48 lakh from banks, while the remaining amount came through e-Sampark centres. They are getting a good rush of taxpayers. The number of residential properties is quite high as compared to commercial properties and the tax amount is also high,” an official said. The civic body has decided to give first two months of the financial year (till May 31) to the public to avail a rebate facility. The rebate is 20% and 10% on residential and commercial properties. After the rebate period, the authority will impose a hefty penalty of 25% on the amount and 12%interest on those who failed to pay the tax till the stipulated rebate period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/civic-body-receives-rs-3-crore-property-tax-in-just-8-days/articleshow/82012140.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Chandigarh||Mining department asks DC to demarcate Ghaggar riverbed||PANCHKULA: The officials of the mining department have written a letter to the Panchkula deputy commissioner (DC), Mukesh Kumar Ahuja, to ask the officials of the Haryana Urban Development Authority (Huda) to conduct demarcation of the land falling in the Ghaggar riverbed and passing through the Panchkula-Derabassi border area. The move has been taken to get clarity on the jurisdiction of the two districts. The mining officials stated that a dispute took place three days ago over the jurisdiction of the area. The Panchkula enforcement team caught a poclain machine and a tipper for conducting illegal mining in the Ghaggar riverbed. Upon information, the mining and police officials of Punjab as well as Panchkula reached on the spot. After the officials disagreed over jurisdiction both the teams decided to demarcate the land. The poclain machine and the tipper truck were kept under the supervision of the sarpanch of Peer Muchhalla. The officials have also requested to demarcate the land in front of the revenue officers of both the districts using GPS. Both the officials also decided to not allow anyone to enter the area till the jurisdiction issue was not solved. According to the data of the mines and mineral department, from March 15, 2020 to till date, as many as 123 vehicles have been seized for carrying out illegal mining and 35 FIRs have been registered. Rs 3 crore fine has also been collected from the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mining-department-asks-dc-to-demarcate-ghaggar-riverbed/articleshow/82012158.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab has only five days of Covid-19 vaccine left: CM Amarinder Singh||CHANDIGARH: With Punjab left with only five days of supply (5.7 lakh Covid-19 vaccine doses) at the current levels of vaccinating 85,000-90,000 persons a day, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh has urged the Centre to share the schedule for supply of vaccines with the states over the next quarter based on their confirmed supply orders. Hoping that the Centre would send fresh batches of vaccine supply soon, the chief minister said if the state was able to meet its target of 2 lakh vaccines a day, then its current supplies would last only three days. He added that he had written to the Prime Minister and the Union health minister to give confirmed supply schedules. Despite being a slow-starter in vaccination, Punjab has vaccinated more than 16 lakh persons, at an average of around 850,00-90,000 per day, he said during a video conference convened by Congress president Sonia Gandhi to discuss the Covid-19 situation. The meeting was attended by chief ministers of the Congress-ruled states as well as senior party leaders, including Rahul Gandhi. Captain Amarinder Singh said people in Punjab were still not coming out in large numbers for vaccination due to massive anger prevailing against the Government of India on the issue of farm laws. Since Punjab has majority population among the agriculture community, even the common man is affected by the farmers’ agitation, he said, adding, “This anger is impacting the vaccination drive.” The CM said his government was undertaking an extensive media campaign to address the misinformation regarding Covid-19 and vaccination hesitancy. Ranking 18th in the country at present in terms of cases reported, Punjab is showing around 8% positivity with an average of around 3,000 cases per day for the past 15 days, the CM apprised Sonia Gandhi. “The number of cases is slightly stable,” he pointed out, adding, “This shows that steps taken in the last three weeks are in the right direction.” Even in the graphs put up by the health ministry in Prime Minister’s review meeting on Friday, the “curve appears to be flattened over the past fortnight,” he said, disclosing that the state currently had around 27,200 active cases with recovery rate of 87.1%. The chief minister, however, said deaths were a concern for Punjab, with around 50-60 daily deaths with a little under 2% case fatality rate (CFR) in the second surge. Overall, CFR is 2.77% for all reported cases since March 2020, he added. Pointing out that on April 9, 2021, a total of 3,459 persons tested positive out of 41,347 samples tested and 56 deaths were reported, he said the high death rate had been on account of late reporting to hospitals, high co-morbidity (non-communicable diseases). Noting that high positivity is being seen in the younger population and as per reports received from National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), more than 80% samples have been found to be positive for the more contagious and virulent UK variant, Amarinder shared with the Congress president various measures taken by his government to combat the spread. These, he said, included complete ban on political gatherings till April 30, imposition of night curfew across all districts from 9pm to 5am, restrictions on numbers in outdoor and indoor social gatherings and in cinema halls and malls, and closure of all educational institutions and anganwadi centres, with school exams being postponed. He said his government had to impose ban on political gatherings as opposition leaders like Arvind Kejriwal and Sukhbir Badal were holding rallies in the state in violation of Covid-19 norms. Persons not wearing masks are compulsorily taken for RT-PCR testing, he said, adding that two lakh such people have so far been taken by police for testing. Further, Covid monitors have been appointed in all hotels, restaurants and marriage palaces to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour. All health care workers, who have not been vaccinated, are being tested weekly for general safety, he revealed. Amarinder also gave details of testing and contact tracing, revealing that more than 40,000 tests were being conducted per day of which more than 90% were RT-PCR, with Punjab’s testing per million is higher than national average. Testing average is 1,350 per million (over last seven days) against all-India average of 824 per million. “Testing is being increased to 50,000 per day,” he added. “On contact tracing, we are slightly lower than desired number of 25-30. Currently we are at 13.4 contacts for every case, but we plan to increase it to 20 by within a fortnight,” said the CM. Underlining the importance of tracing and testing, he said a total of 20.8 lakh, who had been in contact with Covid-19 patients, had been identified of whom 8.36 lakh had been tested and 90,000 had tested positive. The state is ramping up tracing, he said, adding that he had asked the deputy commissioners to use available staff in all departments to increase testing. Amarinder also apprised Sonia of his communication with the Union government on Covid-19 and vaccine management, including the two letters he has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, seeking flexibility for states to devise their local vaccination strategies. He added that he had requested the Centre for inclusion of patients with liver and kidney disease below age of 45 and to focus on immunizing all adults in high-risk areas, besides covering all teachers & staff in all educational institutions and occupation-based immunization for judges & judicial officers, bus drivers & conductors and elected representatives at all levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-has-only-five-days-of-covid-19-vaccine-left-cm/articleshow/82009982.cms||---
---||Lucknow||On its worst Covid day, Lucknow records 23 deaths, 4k cases||LUCKNOW: The deadliest surge of Covid-19 recorded in the city on Saturday left 23 dead and over 4,000 infected. Both the figures were the highest single-day spikes — catapulting Lucknow’s tally to over one lakh and death toll to over 1,300 in the 13 months of the pandemic. For those who still brush aside these figures as “just a few numbers” and continue to take the pandemic casually, here is something to ponder: April’s exponential surge daily infected an average 1,700 people and killed nine patients. TimesViewSelf-discipline is multiple times better than the restrictions imposed by a government. We have already witnessed the devastating impact of lockdown on the economy and lives of one and all. Just little effort to take precautions can prevent millions from facing the miseries caused by such a drastic measure. It's time for us to show how much we love India by protecting ourselves and fellow citizens.Even now if the safety protocols are ignored, warned doctors, then the city will have to bear the brunt of 10,000 cases and 15 deaths daily within two weeks because every patient infects at least five persons, and 14 out of every 1,000 patients succumb to the virus. The second wave that started on March 11 is several times stronger than the first. It has largely been driven by a section of people who show utter disregard to precautions and inadequate enforcement of protocols by the administration, doctors said. Those who are still skeptical about the gravity of the situation, following date will give some idea of how contagious and deadly the second wave is: it took five months to record the first 10,000 cases, but the last 10,000 cases came in just five days. Such callousness by a section of public and belowexpectation administrative efforts have made Lucknow a Covid hotspot in the state. In the past 24 hours, every third infection and second death that took place in UP was from the state capital. The situation did not turn grave in a day. In just 25 days of the second wave (from March 15 till April 10), the city recorded 20,818 infections, almost equal to 23,711 cases recorded in six months between from October 15 to March 14. The 4,059 cases and 23 deaths on Saturday took the city’s caseload to 1.03 lakh. Of these 84,972 (82.5%) patients including 825 on Saturday have recovered so far, but 1,301 (1.3%) died and 16,690 (16%) are battling with the virus at present. The impact of such a situation is that Covid-19 hospitalisations soared to nearly 1,800. Of these, 600 are serious and 500 critical. Even testing labs, both government and private, are struggling to keep up with the pressure. As a result, Covid hospitals are almost full and labs take 3-4 days to give results. Non-Covid patients, too, are left with little treatment options and facing difficulties in getting Covid tests done, a must to visit a non-Covid hospital. As administration continued to keep details of the deaths and areawise cases within the city under wraps, doctors said, “You can catch people’s attention to instil responsible behaviour by informing cases and casualties in their localities.” “One lakh cases and 1,300 deaths means that almost every family in the city has been affected by the pandemic, hence every individual needs to rise to the occasion. I am hopeful that people will pass the test,” said Ajay Awasthi, a social activist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/on-its-worst-covid-day-lucknow-records-23-deaths-4k-cases/articleshow/82012198.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Beds filling up, but fewer Covid patients turning critical in Gurugram||GURUGRAM: Covid cases are rising in the city and so is occupancy of ICU and ventilator beds. But the severity of cases has come down in the past one month. Data sourced from the health department suggests there were 343 active cases in Gurugram district on March 1. Of them, 15 Covid patients or 4.3% were in the ICU and four persons or 1.1% were on ventilator support. Although the bed occupancy by Covid patients in the critical category has increased multiple times since March 1, the severity of the cases is lower when compared to the number of active cases. As of Saturday, Gurugram had 5,013 active cases. Of them, 92 patients or 1.8% were in the ICU and 30 patients or 0.6% were on ventilator support. This suggests that fewer patients are turning critical now. However, when viewed in absolute terms, the ICU bed occupancy in city hospitals has increased six-fold and that of ventilator beds seven times in the past one month. The rise in the number of Covid patients has become a cause for concern for health officials, who fear non-emergency services will again get affected. “What comes as a respite is that patients are less critical this time and we have sufficient beds as of now. This severity of cases is also reflected in the fatality rate, which is 0.5% at present,” said Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer. The health department’s data also suggests that the occupancy of general beds meant for Covid patients has also gone up from 106 on March 1 to 432 on Saturday. “Last year, the number of patients coming to us was gradual. But this time, the numbers are rising exponentially. However, we have patients with less severity and beds are also available at the moment,” said Dr Anjali Kaul, medical superintendent at Artemis Hospitals. However, doctors fear that if cases continue to rise by leaps and bounds, the city’s health infrastructure would be overburdened. “The graph of Covid cases is going up quickly, which means that health infrastructure has to be strengthened. But more and more people are also getting admitted for routine surgeries, heart ailments and other illnesses. Along with them, Covid beds are also getting filled fast. So, it is going to be a testing time for hospitals. If people don’t get beds, it would lead to chaos,” said Dr Sushila Kataria, director and head of internal medicine at Medanta — The Medicity. Dr Kataria said that of the 92 ICU beds occupied at city hospitals, 60% were at Medanta. “We had 30 Covid patients in the beginning of March. Now, we have around 190 patients in the Covid ward. We are getting at least 70 to 80 requests every day for Covid beds,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/beds-filling-up-but-fewer-covid-patients-turning-critical-in-gurgaon/articleshow/82010000.cms||Vishakha Chaman
---||Chandigarh||16 deaths in 10 days, 13% weekly positivity rate leave Chandigarh gasping||CHANDIGARH: Sixteen deaths in 10 days. A weekly positivity rate of 13% that is higher than of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana. A total of 3,085 cases since April. And, 398 new infections and three fatalities on Saturday. Covid-19 situation is turning grimmer by the day in the city. “There have been some cases of reinfection. We are also getting severe cases this time, as most of the mild-to-moderate patients are isolated at home. But the number of deaths is increasing, which is alarming,” said a public health expert. Health experts believe the virus would mostly affect those unexposed in the previous wave. “We do not see many cases from Bapu Dham Colony, Sector 26, a hotspot during the start of the pandemic. Those who were not affected are more vulnerable. The more the virus spreads, the greater is the rate of mutation. This mutation can either make the virus more dangerous or dilute it totally,” said an epidemiologist. Chandigarh is among seven states/UTs having a weekly daily average growth of more than 1%. The others are Punjab, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand. Chandigarh had been flagged as a city of grave concern due to its high positivity rate since March 17 by the ministry of health and family welfare. “Samples were sent for genome sequencing to NIV, Pune, from PGI from January. But it is still not known which mutant strains are in the city,” said a faculty member in PGI. Although public health experts have predicted that by mid-April cases would continue to rise, it is uncertain if this second surge would behave the same way as the first wave or not. “The growth in the cases is rapid. We are seeing reinfection as well. So, it is difficult to say when the peak will flatten,” said a public health expert. On the other hand, tests per million per day have risen from 2,212 on April 8 to 2,860 on April 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/16-deaths-in-10-days-13-weekly-positivity-rate-leave-chandigarh-gasping/articleshow/82012180.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu on Saturday said the health department received the dispatch intimation of Covid-19 Vaccine from the central government which would be delivered through air cargo at Chandigarh airport. He said a total of 40,000 vials would reach, against the 1 lakhs vials demanded by the Punjab government. Each vial has 10 doses of vaccine. Pointing out the need for rationalisation of vaccines as per demand and supply policy, he directed the civil surgeons to personally check the stock of vaccines in their respective areas and stock of vaccines to be supplied by maintaining the cold chain whereever demand rose. No laxity would be tolerated in case of unjustified wastage, he said. In a bid to ensure hassle-free Covid-19 vaccination drive and treatment services at Covid care hospitals, conducted the surprise checking of four government hospitals at Kharar, Morinda, Chamkaur Sahib and Ropar. On the directives of Capt Amarinder, the health department was conducting the massive vaccination drive at more than 2,500 centres in Punjab where adequate arrangements had been made.

---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Hospitality industry seeks tax waiver||CHANDIGARH: Fearing more losses, retrenchment of employees and closure of outlets, the hospitality industry has sought support from the UT administration and urged it to allow them to operate in night hours as well. “At a time when the hospitality industry is still reeling under the pressure of recovery from the losses due to the first lockdown in 2020, second wave and restrictions imposed by the administration have come as another blow to our industry,” said Ankit Gupta, president, Chandigarh Hospitality Association. “The industry has already suffered a lot. We are ready to follow Covid protocols and the administration should give us some relaxations. It should also find some way to give financial assistance in form of waiver of taxes, licensing fee, power and water charges. The industry need handholding support from the administration,” he added. Anuj, who works in a city based restaurant, said the industry provides employment to many people and is connected with many other businesses like musical events and florists. They also have families to look after during this pandemic and the administration should consider their genuine demands, he added. Recently, the administration had turned down the demand of the industry for extension of deadline of paying annual licence fee for 2021-22 financial year by at least a month. The administration had fixed March 31 as the deadline. Meanwhile, the administration issued fresh instructions to police department and sub-divisional magistrates (SDMs) to check violations by hotels, restaurants and clubs in their jurisdic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-hospitality-industry-seeks-tax-waiver/articleshow/82012226.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Residents of the housing society raised safety concerns saying that the road remains poorly lit and is difficult to navigate. They alleged that several complaints have been sent to the municipal corporation but no action has been taken so far. DD Sharma, RWA President of Rail Vihar said, “There are security concerns because of the lack of visibility as there are 7-8 streetlights, which have not been functioning for the last three months. We have also raised complaints with the local councillor and even on the CM window but they have fallen on deaf ears. Moreover, streetlights that are functional along this stretch are also covered by overgrown trees, which need pruning.” Rakesh Sethi, a member of the managing committee said, “The traffic has increased as there are barricades on the main sector road. Also, many incidents of chain snatching have been reported in the area.” Meanwhile, Hariom Atri, joint commissioner of MCG, said: “The matter is not in my knowledge. However, I will get it checked on Monday and the problem will be rectified soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/streetlights-not-working-residents-say-safety-at-stake/articleshow/82010468.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Friday prayers stop at 1 site as outfit keeps up ‘campaign’||Gurgaon: Right-wing group Bharat Mata Vahini tried to disrupt Friday prayers yet again in Gurgaon — this time, at three more locations in sectors 29, 43 and 44 — reiterating its demand for a city-wide ban on offering namaz in public places. This development came after similar disruptions by the group in Sector 40 for the past few weeks. Meanwhile, Friday prayers in Sector 40 have been suspended for the time being. Around noon on Friday, members of Bharat Mata Vahini, led by Dinesh Bharti, appeared in Sector 44 and told the Imam and others that they would not be allowed to offer Friday prayers at the site. “The group asked me if we had permission to offer prayers at the spot. I told them the site is in the list approved by the administration and the police have been regularly coming here for safety purposes,” said Junaid, the imam. Junaid said Bharti kept arguing with him and said they wanted to chant Hanuman chalisa at the same spot. “I told him we could offer namaz and they could chant Hanuman chalisa alongside, which would send a message of unity between the two communities. But Bharti was not convinced and said that the administration or the police had no role in giving permissions for Friday prayers,” he said. Later Junaid went to the Sushant Lok-1 police station and submitted a complaint in the matter. However, no FIR has been registered as yet. “We are taking action as per the law,” the SHO told TOI. Gurgaon police’s DCP (east) Maqsood Ahmed could not be reached for a comment. Meanwhile, the Friday prayers at the Sector 40 site have been suspended for the time being. “The district administration has clarified that this site was actually not on the list. We had chalked out an arrangement with the administration to let prayers happen here after we reduced the number of namaz sites from 100 to 40 in 2018,” said local imam Absul Hasif. “We have spoken to the SHO of the Sector 40 police station for safety arrangements next week when Ramzan starts,” Hasif added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/friday-prayers-stop-at-1-site-as-outfit-keeps-up-campaign/articleshow/82010479.cms||Shubhra Pant

They had also threatened to kill her, police said. The complainant, a 24-year-old woman from Tamil Nadu who is five months pregnant, has been living in Chakkarpur for the last one year and works as a domestic staffer in nearby societies. Last year, she got in touch with Pawan Tripathi, a native of Allahabad in UP, who works as a driver. They started living together. When she discovered she was pregnant, she insisted on getting married, which led to frequent arguments between the two as Pawan wanted her to terminate the pregnancy. On Thursday, Pawan and his friend Nitin started beating her when she again refused to abort the fetus, repeatedly kicking her in the stomach. The woman later delivered a dead fetus at home, which Pawan and Nitin allegedly disposed of. As the condition of the woman deteriorated, the duo took her to Civil hospital the next day, where she shared her ordeal with doctors. The doctors in turn informed police. “Pawan forced me into a physical relationship. After I became pregnant, he killed my child,” the woman said in her police complaint. An FIR case was registered at Sector 29 police station on Saturday. “Both men have been arrested,” said police spokesperson Subhash Boken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/pregnant-woman-thrashed-suffers-miscarriage-2-held/articleshow/82010022.cms||---

Around 20,000 doses of the vaccine would be given to Ghaziabad, which is expected to get its own stock of 80,000 doses on Sunday morning. With only a few thousand doses left, it was touch-and-go whether the health departments of Noida and Ghaziabad would be able to carry out vaccinations for long. “We will give 20,000 doses to Ghaziabad as loan so that inoculations aren’t hampered there on Sunday,” said Neeraj Tyagi, the district immunisation officer in Noida. Vaccines would be administered at 95 centres in Noida on Sunday, 40 of which would be government facilities. Officials insisted that all these centres would have enough stock of vaccines by the morning. Not just those who have registered, these centres will also allow walk-in inoculations to anyone aged over 45 years. According to the target set by the UP government for the four-day tika utsav, Noida is expected to vaccinate 18,500 people on Sunday and 35,000 each on Monday and Tuesday. Following this, the district is expecting another batch of vaccines from Lucknow. Officials told TOI the fresh batch of vaccines received on Saturday would last the next four days. “We have sufficient doses for now. Vaccination will be done at all authorised centres. We just hope everyone who is eligible comes forward to get the shot,” said Noida district magistrate Suhas LY. On Saturday evening, Ghaziabad was left with only 4,000 doses. The district, which is expecting 80,000 doses from Lucknow on Sunday morning, is aiming at vaccinating about 1 lakh people during the tika utsav. “The tika utsav is aimed at boosting the vaccination drive. In Ghaziabad, we are targeting about 1 lakh people over the next four days,” said NK Gupta, the chief medical office. “On Sunday, we plan to vaccinate 18,000 recipients. On Monday and Tuesday, we have set a target of 35,000 vaccinations each. The remaining will be covered on Wednesday,” he added. Gupta asserted that unlike the past few days, there would be no dearth of vaccines in the district till Wednesday. “There will be no shortage whatsoever. We have 4,000 doses with us. In addition, we will get 80,000 doses from Lucknow by Sunday morning. We have also asked for 25,000 doses from Noida, which we hope to get by Sunday morning,” said Gupta. The CMO also informed that a van to bring the vaccines had been sent to Lucknow and the vehicle was expected to be back in Ghaziabad by Sunday morning. While there are no corporate requests yet, officials in both the districts are planning to set up camps in offices and institutions. “We will be organising vaccination camps in offices as well. But they have to request us first,” said Tyagi, the Noida immunisation officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/a-day-before-tika-utsav-noida-gets-fresh-stock-of-80k-covishield-doses/articleshow/82010033.cms||Snehil Sinha

Cans of paint, packets of brushes and lots of skill will be employed to change the drab back walls of houses. The murals will come up under the ‘Swachh Bharat Mission’, an idea that the municipal corporation (MC) came up with after successfully giving a new and colourful look to some public places. MC commissioner R K Singh said they received a good response on the art work at done at bus queue shelters and flyovers across the city. Taking the initiative a step further, he said the MC decided to start painting murals related to sanitation and cleanliness on the back walls of houses on the dividing roads. A team of Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) has already told house owners about the plan. People have been asked to submit objections, if any, to the SBM at the MC office in Sector 14. “We have not received any objections from residents so far. If any do come, we will discuss and try to resolve them,” Singh said. The first murals will cover the Sector 10-11 diving road at the entry of Panchkula from the housing board light point. Officials will take feedback from local residents. If they are impressed, work will start in phases. The dividing roads of sectors 7-18, 8-17, 9-16, 10-15 and 11-4 will be covered first. The MC has already taken out a tender, receiving a few responses as well. Mayor Kulbhushan Goyal said, “The work will be under the city beautification project. It will be completed within five months. The city will wear a new look.” MC officials without spending a single penny had got art design done at 30 bus queue shelters and under the flyover at Majri chowk. The MC carried out the work under corporate social responsibility by tying up with Haryana Navyuvak Kala.

There are 213 private hospitals on board for the Covid-19 treatment in the state and the government has provided 230 ventilators to private hospitals. Lal expressed his concerns about the critical care specialists of private hospitals not attending sessions being organised by Dr KK Talwar and advised the hospitals to ensure that their critical care specialists must attend these webinars. Talking about the rising number of fatalities, especially while shifting the patients from level II to level III facilities, he said referral should be made in time and more than 20,000 doses of Remdisivir had been provided to the government and private hospitals and these were available free of cost. He further exhorted the hospitals to treat the patient at the level of which they have the facilities available and the patient should be referred to the appropriate level well in time, if they feel that the patient requires higher level of hospitalization. He also urged private hospitals to set-up Covid-19 vaccination centres to facilitate vaccination. Lal further reiterated that oxygen demand and supply must be communicated to the civil surgeon of the district so that in case of any additional requirement, the same could be made available from the appropriate source well in time. Principal secretary (medical education & research) DK Tiwari stressed the need to increase the vaccination of the appropriate levels of eligible beneficiaries. President of the Punjab Medical Council Dr AS Sekhon assured the health department that PMC shall work in close coordination with the private hospitals to ensure that they all follow the protocols and attend the webinars as well, and for this purpose districts shall be allocated to each medical council member, who shall coordinate Covid-19 management and vaccination in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/as-covid-19-rages-pvt-hosps-in-pb-told-to-defer-elective-surgeries-till-april-30/articleshow/82010087.cms||---

Police said Delhi residents Naveen and Puneet Singh Tomar had earlier worked in a call centre that dealt with insurance companies and had access to data of thousands of users. Before they left the job, they stole the data and used it to commit the fraud. The police are now finding out if more people were involved in the racket. The accused would call up those who had defaulted on payments and promise to help them get back their policy amount for a fee. Since they had details of the policy holders, it made their job much easier. “We were tipped off by Mumbai police. The gang had committed cyber fraud in which a man from Maharashtra had lost around Rs 60 lakh,” said Nipun Agarwal, SP (city). The man had lodged a complaint in Maharashtra’s Chandarpur district, alleging that the gang posed as IRDA officials and assured him he would get back his insurance amount despite defaulting on paying the premium. The gang allegedly sent him notices printed on forged IRDA letterheads and made him deposit Rs 60 lakh in six different bank accounts in Ghaziabad. “Since the gang shared with the victims the nature of their default and other details of their policies, they believed in them,” Agarwal said. The police have recovered 10 mobile phones, forged documents and stamps from the duo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/two-steal-data-pose-as-officials-to-cheat-many/articleshow/82010088.cms||Abhijay Jha

The route was shut in 2019 due to the construction of an underpass at the sector 51, 52, 71 and 72 intersection. As a result, people heading towards Indirapuram in Ghaziabad via Captain Shashi Kant Marg were unable to take the stretch and instead had to take a detour via the Gijhore turn. However, the underpass work is almost in its final stage. Officials involved in the project said the barricades at the Gijhore turn will be removed within the next 10 days. The work on the underpass had commenced in July 2019 and by October that year barricades had been put up to block the traffic merging at the intersection from all four sides. “During a review of priority infrastructure projects that was held on Thursday, it was found that 90 per cent of the underpass work is complete. The remaining work is expected to get over by May 31,” said the chief executive officer of the Noida Authority, Ritu Maheshwari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/city-centre-sec-62-route-to-reopen-soon/articleshow/82010092.cms||Shalabh

This comes as a relief for the farmers waiting to sell their crops for the last two days. Haryana promises to take up DBT issue with Centre The decision to end the strike was taken by the Haryana arhityas association president Ashok Gupta and other members after a meeting with the government officials, including principal secretary of CM Umma Sankar and additional chief secretary, food, civil supplies, and consumer affairs department Anurag Rastogi in Chandigarh the previous night. Gupta said, "The statewide strike of the arhtiyas has been called off after the state government promised to take up the issue with the central government. Till then, the concerned commission agent will be intimated one day prior to the disbursal of payment to the bank account of the farmer." The farmers were caught in a bind due to the standoff between the government and the arhtiyas over the last 2 days. “I brought my produce to Assandh mandi on April 8, but due to the arhtiyas' strike, I had been waiting to sell my produce...Finally, I sold my crop on MSP on Saturday,” said Dharambir Singh, a farmer from Ardana village, Karnal.

Active cases jumped to 37,673 as just 1,952 patients were discharged. For the second consecutive day, the state reported more than one lakh vaccinations. By 7pm, 1.27 lakh had taken the jab. The state has a target of 2 lakh vaccinations a day. “We have used only about 36.5 lakh doses of the 54.8 lakh doses we received. We will have adequate stock,” said the director of public health Dr T S Selvavinayagam. Health authorities were inspecting hostels, unoccupied housing board complexes and large community halls to be converted into Covid care centres. All medical college hospitals in Chennai have cut down on elective surgeries so resources can be diverted to management and treatment of Covid patients. Health secretary J Radhakrishnan inspected the 500-bed centre set up by the Greater Chennai Corporation at the Victoria Boy’s hostel, which will be attached to the Government Multi Super Speciality Hospital at Omandurar. “Such centers worked well during the pandemic last year as they prevent crowding at tertiary care centers. We’ll use them this year too for patients with mild or no symptoms,” the health secretary said. Chennai has 13 Covid care centres, not including hospitals, with 11,775 beds. By Saturday afternoon, active cases in the city touched 14,382, with 1,977 new cases added. Most Chennai hospitals were admitting patients from Chengalpet, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur. On Saturday, cases in Chengalpet shot up to 615 compared to 465 on Friday. While Tiruvallur reported 212 new cases, Kancheepuram added 181, which pushed the day’s tally in Chennai region to 2985 – nearly 50% of the total cases reported in the state. “The state will set up screening centres to triage patients to hospitals, health centres and covid care centres based on their medical condition,” Radhakrishnan said. “Now, patients are crowding Kings Institute and Omandurar hospital. We don’t want healthy patients occupying oxygen beds meant to treat sick patients,” he said. After Chennai, thirteen districts reported new cases in three digits. After Chennai and Chengalpet, Coimbatore with 501 had the highest number of new cases. While Madurai(194), Trichy (187), Tiruppur (154), Nagapattinam (145), Salem(136), Cuddalore (127), Tirunelveli (117), Thanjavur(116) and Tuticorin (102) crossed the 100 mark, Krishnagiri (97), Kanyakumari (96), Ranipet (92) and Thiruvarur (92) were inching towards it. The directorate of public health said that the case count and positivity rate have been increasing rapidly in Ranipet, Theni, Tiruvannamalai and Salem, besides Chennai, Chengalpet and Coimbatore. “The positivity rate in these districts is higher than national average. Our aim is to bring it below 5% and the only way to do it is by increasing testing,” said Dr Selvavinayagam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/tamil-nadu-records-23-more-covid-deaths/articleshow/82012276.cms||---

The state has a target of 2 lakh vaccinations a day. “We have used only about 36.5 lakh doses of the 54.8 lakh doses we received. We will have adequate stock,” said the director of public health Dr T S Selvavinayagam. Health authorities were inspecting hostels, unoccupied housing board complexes and large community halls to be converted into Covid care centres. All medical college hospitals in Chennai have cut down on elective surgeries so resources can be diverted to management and treatment of Covid patients. Health secretary J Radhakrishnan inspected the 500-bed centre set up by the Greater Chennai Corporation at the Victoria Boy’s hostel, which will be attached to the Government Multi Super Speciality Hospital at Omandurar. “Such centers worked well during the pandemic last year as they prevent crowding at tertiary care centers. We’ll use them this year too for patients with mild or no symptoms,” the health secretary said. Chennai has 13 Covid care centres, not including hospitals, with 11,775 beds. By Saturday afternoon, active cases in the city touched 14,382, with 1,977 new cases added. Most Chennai hospitals were admitting patients from Chengalpet, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur. On Saturday, cases in Chengalpet shot up to 615 compared to 465 on Friday. While Tiruvallur reported 212 new cases, Kancheepuram added 181, which pushed the day’s tally in Chennai region to 2985 – nearly 50% of the total cases reported in the state. “The state will set up screening centres to triage patients to hospitals, health centres and covid care centres based on their medical condition,” Radhakrishnan said. “Now, patients are crowding Kings Institute and Omandurar hospital. We don’t want healthy patients occupying oxygen beds meant to treat sick patients,” he said. After Chennai, thirteen districts reported new cases in three digits. After Chennai and Chengalpet, Coimbatore with 501 had the highest number of new cases. While Madurai(194), Trichy (187), Tiruppur (154), Nagapattinam (145), Salem(136), Cuddalore (127), Tirunelveli (117), Thanjavur(116) and Tuticorin (102) crossed the 100 mark, Krishnagiri (97), Kanyakumari (96), Ranipet (92) and Thiruvarur (92) were inching towards it. The directorate of public health said that the case count and positivity rate have been increasing rapidly in Ranipet, Theni, Tiruvannamalai and Salem, besides Chennai, Chengalpet and Coimbatore. “The positivity rate in these districts is higher than national average. Our aim is to bring it below 5% and the only way to do it is by increasing testing,” said Dr Selvavinayagam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tamil-nadu-records-23-more-covid-deaths/articleshow/82012273.cms||---
