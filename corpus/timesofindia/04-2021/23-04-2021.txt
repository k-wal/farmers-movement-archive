He also said predicting the second wave was a real problem for researchers across the globe. "I do think given the predictions that are being made by many epidemiological researchers that the pandemic (peak) should not extend beyond May, based on that we have done some internal assessments. I think that the impact actually may not be very large (on the economy)," he said. Speaking at a webinar organised by the Financial Times and The Indian Express, he said "all of us economists actually have to say all these things with enormous dose of humility, because not only in India but in every other country, predicting the pandemic has been extremely difficult." As far as second wave is concerned, he said there is a lot more knowledge about how to handle it and it is unlikely that India will go into a national lockdown as there have been a lot of learnings from the past. On the long-term prospects for the Indian economy, he said, growth should go back to 7 per cent-plus in a couple of years. This year actually will be an exceptional year because of the low base, he added. He also said public sector banks are in a much better shape compared to the past couple of years. "There will be stress that is coming because when the real sector will get impacted because of the first wave and the second wave, but our banks are in a much better shape to handle it and the government remains actually committed behind them as well," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/covid-second-waves-impact-on-economy-may-not-be-very-large-cea/articleshow/82202938.cms||---

The GFA executive committee which met on Thursday decided to impose a six-month ban on match referee Mario Pereira, assistant referee Melwin D’Costa and match commissioner Egidio Da Costa. When they return to officiating after six months, the trio will be kept out of Pro League matches for another six months. The officials are being punished for the drama that happened in the 73rd minute of the clash between Calangute Association and Salgaocar. Calangute won a penalty after Melvin Lobo’s shot was handled by Salgaocar defender Linbert Rebello. Kouame Junior converted the penalty, but referee Pereira overruled the goal and called for a retake as one Calangute player had his foot inside the box when the penalty was taken. Title-contenders Salgaocar objected and the referee then consulted with his assistant and changed his earlier decision of a retake. Instead, Salgaocar were awarded a free-kick and the teams did not continue with the match. GFA admitted there was a blunder with president Churchill Alemao saying the “referees were in a confused state of mind.” He also requested the teams to complete the game in “sporting spirit” in his letter on Friday. GFA planned to schedule the game on Monday, but Salgaocar delayed in their response as their offices were closed on weekends. Salgaocar have now agreed to continue the game from the 73rd minute with Calangute taking the penalty at 5.40pm on April 30. Sporting Clube de Goa who are currently at the top of the standings will also play their final game on the same day against Guardian Angel SC. Salgaocar have a game in hand and will play Sesa FA in a rescheduled fixture on Monday. Meanwhile, Sesa FA have been docked six points for fielding an ineligible player who tested positive and took the field without undergoing the mandatory 14-day quarantine period. The player was fielded against Youth Club of Manora and Panjim Footballers. Manora and Panjim had lodged their protest and have now been awarded three points each. Manora had lost 2-3 while Panjim suffered a solitary goal defeat. Dempo SC have also been awarded three points after Velsao SCC reported without the mandatory Covid-19 negative certificates of their players and officials for their game on Tuesday. “I am not the spokesperson of the GFA and cannot speak anything,” GFA general secretary Jovito Lopes told TOI when contacted to confirm the decisions of the executive committee on Thursday. There was no response from competitions committee chairman Dominic Pereira either.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfa-bans-erring-match-officials-for-six-months/articleshow/82203989.cms||FLAVIO LOPES
---||Ghaziabad||Covid-19: With oxygen running out, Delhi-NCR hospitals asking patients to leave||NEW DELHI: Hospitals in Delhi-NCR had to issue appeals all through Thursday for their oxygen stock to be replenished with the lives of their Covid patients hanging in the balance. Top private hospitals like Apollo, Fortis, Max and Ganga Ram issued open appeals to the authorities to ensure timely delivery of the critical supply, citing the number of Covid patients who were dependent on it for their survival. However, smaller hospitals — with lesser influence but equally worried about the Covid patients in their care — were jittery and reaching a breaking point. Some of them began asking their patients to look for beds in other hospitals while stopping new admissions. Read AlsoOxygen running out in Delhi, CM Arvind Kejriwal turns to CentreIt is Delhi's worst nightmare. While Covid patients are running around for beds, the city is literally gasping. It is facing an acute shortage of oxygen, and by Wednesday morning, the situation may turn grave."We are supposed to give life. If we cannot give even oxygen, our patients will die," said Sunil Kumar Saggar, CEO of Shanti Mukand Hospital in Karkardooma, in a choked voice around 2.43pm on Thursday with his hospital left with just two hours of oxygen. He was anxious about the 110 Covid patients in their care. The crisis had started brewing at this 200-bed hospital around 3am. Out of the 110 Covid patients, 12 were on ventilator with one consuming 18 litres of oxygen per minute. Saggar, along with a couple of doctors, reviewed the situation and hoped to survive for some more hours, relying on the 1.7 metric tonnes of oxygen received from their vendor a day earlier. By 5am, more doctors had arrived. However, as the day progressed, the hospital realised it would soon run out of oxygen. The management reached out to ministers and several other people but to no avail. They then put new admissions on hold and started telling their patients to either arrange for a cylinder or shift them out. Even as Saggar’s video went viral, panic was setting in among the patients. "We discharged five of them but told them we were trying to arrange supplies and if they felt unwell, they could come back later. Two other patients refused to leave and said they would wait and watch. The oxygen tanker finally arrived at 7.20pm. We had one patient who had crashed but we managed to save him. The supply we have received will keep us going for another 20 hours," said Saggar. He added that Delhi Police provided a green corridor for the tanker. Meanwhile, in Najafgarh, Rathi Hospital, which had 65 Covid patients, was also nervously watching its oxygen stock getting depleted. While Delhi Police officials had managed to arrange some for them on Wednesday, it wasn’t enough. On Thursday morning, around 8am, the hospital sent out an SOS, asking for help. They also put out a tweet informing people that they would soon run out of oxygen. Speaking to TOI, hospital owner Dr Ankur Rathi, said: "Almost 60-70% of our patients needed oxygen. We first thought we would start telling our patients to leave but realised there were no ambulances available and no oxygen cylinders to go with them. We realised it was a helpless situation either way, so we put out a tweet." The hospital spoke to the cops. "It was a team effort and even our patients started looking out for vendors. By evening, we somehow managed to sail through but this is going to last only for seven to eight hours," said Rathi, indicating how nerve-wracking the entire exercise had become. Metro Hospital in Preet Vihar, which was taking care of 100 Covid patients, started shifting them out around 9.18pm after it ran out of oxygen. Dr Kousar A Shah, chief operating officer of Akash Hospital in Dwarka, said they have 233 Covid patients, of whom 75% were able to breath only because of oxygen support. "We have only an hour of oxygen left. All my officials are running around begging for oxygen cylinders so that patients don’t suffer," he said in an appeal to the government on Thursday afternoon. After being asked to look for admission elsewhere by Ishan Hospital in Rohini, family members of a patient summed up their predicament. "It is like leaving a patient to die. There are no beds available anywhere else. We managed to get one here after pleading with the doctors and running around for four days. We cannot go anywhere and we can’t be here either knowing that the oxygen supply is limited." "A patient who is on ventilator support will die within minutes if oxygen supply stops. Someone who is on high-flow oxygen may pull through for a while longer but not much. That is why there can be no delay due to any reason in the supply of oxygen," said Dr Sumit Ray, head of critical care at Holy Family Hospital in south Delhi. The hospital has more than 380 Covid patients on oxygen support. "The situation is unprecedented and horrific. At one of our hospitals, the critical care specialists had to reduce the amount of oxygen being given to patients while they waited for the supply. There was no other way to keep the system running, but at the same time it posed a serious threat to the life of the patients. Our nurses and doctors are crying seeing the patients struggle to breathe due to a problem that can be easily solved through proper coordination," said an anguished doctor, who did not wish to be identified, at a top private hospital. Meanwhile, in Ghaziabad, Shanti Gopal Hospital in Indirapuram and Chandra Lakshmi Hospital in Vaishali were getting ready to discharge patients. At Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Delhi, doctors said, as of 8pm on Thursday, they had only five hours of oxygen left. "At present, 510 Covid patients are admitted and 142 of them are on high-flow oxygen support. If we don’t get timely replenishment of oxygen, there will be mayhem," said an official.

No country had so far added these many cases for two consecutive days. If cases continue to grow at this rate then India could add about a million cases in three days -- another dubious global record the country could have done without.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Thursday also marked the 17th consecutive day that more than a lakh new cases have been added, and the impact is evident on the healthcare system and the surge in daily fatalities. For the 10th consecutive day, India witnessed over 1,000 daily deaths, of which the last three days saw over 2,000 daily deaths. In the past 10 days alone, over 15,000 people have died because of Covid or related complications.

As the surge of the pandemic laid bare the chinks in the country’s health infrastructure with many patients’ kin unable to find scarce hospital beds, a bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices L N Rao and S Ravindra Bhat decided to step in and seek an action plan from the Centre by Friday. Noticing that as many as six high courts had taken up proceedings on treatment of Covid-19 patients and passed orders that could affect distribution of precious resources like oxygen and medicines, the bench asked the Centre to respond on three issues — setting up a national body for equitable distribution of these resources, considering important medicines and medical equipment along with oxygen as essential commodities under ESMA, and logistics for seamless inter-state distribution of medicines and oxygen. The CJI-led bench said, “Prima facie, we are inclined to take the view that distribution of these essential services and supplies must be done in an even-handed manner according to the advice of health authorities which undoubtedly takes into account relevant factors like severity, susceptibility, the number of people affected and the local availability of resources. Read AlsoSC terms Covid-19 situation 'national emergency', agrees to hear Vedanta plea of free oxygen supplyThe Supreme Court Thursday termed the Covid-19 situation as almost a "national emergency" while agreeing to hear Vedanta's plea for opening of its Sterlite copper unit at Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu on the ground that it would produce thousand tonnes of oxygen and give it free of cost to treat patients.“We expect the central government to place before this court a national plan for dealing with the above services and supplies during the pandemic. In these circumstances, we direct that notices be issued to the Union government, state governments/Union Territories and the parties who appeared to have approached the high courts to show cause why uniform orders be not passed by this court in relation to supply of oxygen and essential drugs, method and manner of vaccination, and declaration of lockdown." The hearing also saw the bench cajoling the Tamil Nadu government to allow reopening of Vedanta’s Sterlite copper plant in Tuticorin specifically for producing 1,000 tonnes of medical oxygen. The plant was shut down because of violation of pollution norms.

The Delhi HC had on Wednesday told the Centre to “beg, borrow or steal” oxygen for supplying to Delhi hospitals. A few days ago, Allahabad HC had ordered the UP government to enforce complete lockdown in five major cities — Lucknow, Prayagraj, Kanpur, Varanasi and Gorakhpur — to contain the spread of Covid-19. The SC had stayed the order on April 20. The apex court bench asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta to submit a national action plan by Friday morning. Mehta said the Centre was working round the clock to augment the supply of oxygen and mentioned an application by Vedanta seeking to restart its copper plant in Tuticorin only for the purpose of producing medical oxygen. Read AlsoSuprem Court takes suo moto cognisance of Covid-19 situation, issues notice to CentreSC says hearing by six different HCs on COVID-19 related issues may create some kind of confusion. A bench headed by Chief S A Bobde said it would also consider the issue pertaining to method and manner of Covid-19 vaccination in the country.Appearing for Vedanta, senior advocate Harish Salve said the plant could produce 1,000 tonnes of oxygen every day and Vedanta was ready to supply it to the government free of cost. "If permitted, we can start production in five or six days," he said. But the Tamil Nadu government, through senior advocate K V Vishwanathan, said the plant was closed because of noxious discharge damaging the environment and it was not sure about the consequences on the environment by permitting reopening of the plant. He said the SC had earlier rejected Vedanta's plea for reopening of the plant, which was closed in 2018. Mehta said the country urgently needed medical oxygen supply. "If there was a choice between saving the environment and human lives, the government would go for saving lives," he said. The bench cajoled the TN government and said it should not put a spoke in the production of oxygen and assured that it would judicially ensure that the plant operated only for producing oxygen. Vedanta’s application will also be heard on Friday. The SC appointed Salve and advocate Anuradha Dutt as amici curiae in the proceedings on the national plan for Covid management.

The measure is intended to encourage better use of vaccinations as the demand will need to be more carefully managed once 50% of vaccine production in India becomes available for states and private hospitals from May 1. At present, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Bihar and Rajasthan are among big states with an over 6% wastage, whereas Assam has the highest of 9.6% with Manipur recording 8.4%. Others like Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi also have over 5% wastage of vaccines, official data show. Among the better performing states are Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Mizoram and Goa with zero wastage.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); As per the new policy, vaccine manufacturers would supply 50% of their monthly doses to the Centre and would be free to supply the remaining doses to state governments and in the open market at a pre-declared price. The Centre, from its share, will allocate vaccines to states and UTs based on extent and curve of infection (number of active Covid cases) and performance (speed of administration). Apart from these, wastage of vaccine will also be weighed, the government has said.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Given that supply of vaccines will be limited, at least initially, states would need maximum stocks – through their own procurement as well as from the Centre – to cater to their requirement. With more than 30 lakh vaccine doses given till 8 pm on Thursday, India has administered a total of more than 13.53 crore doses so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-vaccine-wastage-will-negatively-impact-allocation-of-stocks-from-centres-kitty-to-states-from-may-1/articleshow/82205185.cms||Sushmi Dey

On Thursday, the cheapest one-way fare from Mumbai or Delhi to New York for travel this weekend (April 23) started at just over Rs 1.4 lakh on an Air India flight. For travel next week, say on April 29, the cheapest was Rs 1.5 lakh for travel from Mumbai on a non-stop flight, while it was Rs 60,000 for a 20-hour flight with a transit halt. Advance purchase ticket, say for one-way travel from Mumbai to Newark, on, say May 15, started at Rs 60,000. But with uncertainty over whether flights from India will be banned by US by then, it’s not a viable option now. The cheapest one-way fare to San Francisco began at over Rs 1 lakh for travel next week, on long duration transit flights. Read Also'High fares' may hit re-run of passenger train serviceThe decision of the Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) to resume passenger train service on a regular basis for the first time since last year’s lockdown may ease inter and intra-state passenger movement but will certainly pinch the pockets of travellers because of a near three-fold hike in passengerA travel agent said, “Airfares on flights to the US and the UK have more than tripled with the second Covid wave hitting India hard. Add to that uncertainty over whether these countries will ban flights from India in the coming days, and that leaves passengers with no choice but to book 24-48 hour advance purchase tickets.” That is the problem facing students who have booked to fly to the UK in May. UK will add India to its ‘red list’ of countries on Friday. A note sent by Virgin Atlantic to travel agents said, “Entry to the UK is banned to all but British and Irish nationals and residents, who must undertake 10-day hotel quarantine upon arrival.” The airline added that it was reviewing its schedule of India operations from April 23 and recommended that customers booked to travel to or from India with them check their flight status.

The problem is they have to pay a hefty fare difference, apart from change fee.’’ The cheapest one-way Mumbai-London ticket for non-stop travel on Friday started at Rs 99,000 on Virgin Atlantic on a flight that beat the deadline. But for travel on Saturday, there were no practical options. The cheapest fare was on Vistara for Rs 1.1 lakh for a 24-hour flight with a transit in Delhi. Meanwhile on Thursday, Seychelles announced that only vaccinated visitors from India who have completed two weeks after their second dose can enter the archipelago. “All visitors irrespective of vaccination status will have to present a negative PCR test report taken maximum 72 hours prior to departure,” said a Seychelles tourism spokesperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/as-countries-close-borders-airfares-to-us-uk-up-3-times/articleshow/82205332.cms||Manju V

That is, though 425.06 crore is available under the funds, Tamil Nadu has utilised only 45.86 crore since 2018. A submission to this effect was made by the state government when a public interest writ petition of activist-advocate A P Suryaprakasam alleging that Nirbhaya Funds are not being properly utilised by the state, resulting in rise in crime against women in the state. According to the affidavit, 18.54 crore was utilised by Chennai police towards women police patrol facilities and creating housing for command centres. The Greater Chennai Corporation has utilised 26.04 crore for real-time monitoring. Similarly, the social welfare department has utilised 30 lakh for providing vehicular support for 181 – women help line, 21 lakh as mobilisation advance of the project and 98 lakh is being utilised against first milestone, the report said. When the plea came up for hearing on Thursday, the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy observed the matter could wait till summer vacation of the court, more so under the present pandemic situation. The hearing was then adjourned to a week after the vacation. According to the petitioner, to prevent atrocities on women the Nirbhaya fund was announced by the Union government in its 2013 budget. While over 3,100 crore is still available in the fund, the Union government has once again allotted 2,919 crore to the fund. Eight cities, including Chennai, have been identified to give special focus on women safety in public places and to create a quick response system as a deterrence against crime in these cities, the petitioner said. During the course of hearing, the court made it clear that providing counselling or conducting investigation was not sufficient. State must provide details about how many FIRs were registered in such cases, the status of investigation and the measures taken to prevent such incidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/used-a-mere-10-7-of-nirbhaya-funds-tn-admits-in-high-court/articleshow/82205486.cms||---

---||India||Covid surge: Election Commission slaps ban on poll rallies in West Bengal||NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Thursday barred roadshows, bike rallies and padyatras for the remaining part of West Bengal poll campaign, besides capping attendance at public meetings to 500 persons subject to availability of adequate space with social distancing. EC said any permission for roadshow, cycle/bike/vehicle rally, if already granted, stands withdrawn, while the clearance for public meetings will stand modified in line with the new instructions issued by the Commission by invoking its powers under Article 324 of the Constitution of India. As for nukkad sabhas and street plays, where the gathering is usually very limited, they will continue to be barred only between 7 pm and 10 am. The further curbs – effective from Thursday 7 pm till the closing of campaign at 6.30 pm on April 26 -- were imposed in view of several instances of election meetings and campaigns wherein norms relating to social distancing and wearing of masks were flouted “in blatant disregard” of the Commission’s guidelines for Covid-safe campaign. On Thursday, the Calcutta High Court had rapped EC for not doing enough to enforce its circulars outlining protocols for a Covid-safe campaign. “We are unable to reconcile the fact that the Election Commission of India is not able to update us as to what action by way of enforcement of the circulars has been obtained,” said the two-judge Bench. In its order issued later in the day, EC said it “has noted with anguish that many political parties/candidates are still not adhering to the prescribed safety norms during the public gatherings and this is making difficult for the state/district election machineries to enforce the aforesaid directions fully”. A senior EC functionary told TOI that the ceiling of 500 persons at public meetings would depend on the capacity of the ground to be assessed by the district election officer (DEO) concerned. This upper limit of 500 will apply to both physical rallies addressed by the political leaders/star campaigners/candidates as well as virtual rallies where their address/speech will be played to the gathering in a public space, using multimedia aids. Sources said the limit of 500 participants was seen as reasonable as it would facilitate enforcement of social distancing norms while also ensuring that parties and candidates are not denied their democratic right to campaign. EC on Thursday directed the West Bengal chief electoral officer, DEOs and returning officers to ensure compliance of its latest directions “without fail”. Covid-safe campaign guidelines were first issued by EC on August 21, 2020 ahead of Bihar polls and reiterated for the benefit of five poll-bound states including West Bengal on February 26 and April 9, 2021. On April 9, the commission also gave a strict warning that in case of breach it will not hesitate in banning public meetings, rallies, etc. On April 16, the EC invoked its plenary powers under Article 324 of the Constitution of India to bar rallies, public meetings, nukkad sabhas etc between 7 pm and 10 am. It also extended the silence period for Phase 6, 7 and 8 to 72 hours from 48 hours. On April 21, EC ordered that in case parties/candidates don’t abide by the laid-down Covid protocols during campaign, necessary action under Disaster Management Act 2005 and Epidemic Diseases Act 1897 etc would be initiated immediately by the district authorities and their permission for further campaigns revoked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-surge-ec-slaps-ban-on-election-rallies-in-bengal/articleshow/82205808.cms||Bharti Jain

The division bench of Chief Justice Thottathil B. Radhakrishnan and Justice Arijit Banerjee said it was “unable to reconcile (with) the fact” that the EC was unable to give any “update on action... (and) enforcement” of its own circulars. Read AlsoThe high court bench directed the commission to respond “with a very short affidavit” on Friday morning, stating that the poll panel could not just frame rules and ask people to adhere to them while its officers sat “in their chambers”. “We are sure that the circulars are not merely advisories to be wrapped up by political parties or those involved in political propaganda or even the public at large,” the court added. Bengal’s chief electoral officer Aariz Aftab had earlier this week submitted a detailed response to the HC on the Covid-safety measures the EC had taken, including a ban on campaigning between 7pm and 10am. The affidavit also mentioned the guidelines given to parties and their star campaigners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/west-bengal-elections-2021-you-act-like-seshan-or-we-will-calcutta-hc-tells-election-commission/articleshow/82206003.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

Lenders said, unlike last year when they got additional credit lines and relief in the form of a moratorium, small businesses do not have enough cash to see them through a prolonged shutdown. “While it is too early to comment on the extent of the impact on the asset quality of retail loans due to the rising Covid cases, there is reason to be cautious. After the nationwide lockdown last year, we had witnessed a severe drop in collections for most asset classes though the availability of a moratorium provided a breather from an NPA-recognition perspective,” said Abhishek Dafria, VP and head (structured finance) at Icra. Coronavirus: Live updatesDafria added that while the current restrictions are localised and less harsh, the severity has been gradually increasing as the surge in Covid cases is yet to be brought under control. Pointing out that last year it was microfinance and unsecured SME loans that had the highest delinquencies after the lockdown period, he said that the risk categorisation would remain similar for areas that see stronger government restrictions. According to lenders, they would be helpless if the loans slip into non-performing asset (NPA) category as then no further relief can be given and they would have to initiate recovery proceedings. Last year, in addition to the moratorium and emergency credit line, a SC order had prevented banks from classifying delinquencies after the Covid outbreak as NPAs. Since default by small businesses could result in credit freeze to this segment, the RBI might be forced to look at a moratorium if the lockdown restrictions get extended geographically and extend for a longer period.The Finance Industry Development Council, which represents NBFCs, has written to the RBI seeking an extension of the one-time restructuring of MSME advances till March 2022, as the companies are yet to revive their businesses due to the surge in Covid cases. “Due to the severe second wave of COVID-19, the MSMEs as also the retail and wholesale trader industry have not been able to revive their economic activities and therefore are in urgent need of support from the lenders. Various surveys and reports are forewarning that the operating environment for banks will most likely remain challenging, as the second wave could dent the sluggish recovery in consumer and corporate confidence, and further, suppress banks’ prospects for new business,” the council said in its letter to the RBI governor. According to bankers, the combination of moratorium and emergency credit line guarantee scheme in the previous year helped to protect banks, NBFCs and small businesses. “Last year, the additional line of credit enabled some of the small business to clear expensive loans to NBFCs and the moratorium provided relief until business started. This time around, many small businesses will not have the capacity to remain afloat if the lockdown is extended,” said a senior banker.

Several Kolkatans whose relatives have been affected with the virus and in dire need of either oxygen, anti-viral or plasma have started turning to social media to seek help. They are posting on specific pages on FB, tagging certain Twitter handles or writing in WhatsApp groups to seek help from fellow citizens. Many of them have even full or partial help that has played a crucial role in the treatment of their kin. Arnab Das, a resident of Action Area 1 in New Town, posted on the official page of their forum last week when a close relative required oxygen and hospitalisation. “After being turned down from several places, I sought help on the New Town Resident’s Welfare Forum’s WhatsApp group and FB page. Several fellow residents came forward to help and with their guidance, I managed to get oxygen for my relative and get him hospitalized,” said Das. Doctors told Priyanka Kumari that her father who was admitted in a CIT Road nursing home with Covid infection will need four units of plasma. When they did not get plasma from anywhere, husband Kaushal Kishore sent out a desperate tweet pleading for plasma. “We got help instantly and at least one unit of plasma has been arranged. But we need three more,”said Priyanka Kumari. Several people are calling up on numbers posted by desperate relatives on social media and enquiring if they had received what they needed. Others are collating contact details of medicine shop owners and those who can provide oxygen cylinders and posting them Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp groups so that others can get in touch with them if needed. “My Twitter timeline and WhatsApp are filled with requests and pleas from people in distress and desperately searching for hospital beds, oxygen or plasma. I am also taking help of social media to reach out to people who can help and then connect the two,” said Ajaay Mittal of Project Life Force. People sending SOS on social media also indicates how the administration has failed in ramping up the healthcare infrastructure even almost 15 months of the pandemic. “Even after one-and-a-half years, we do not have proper testing facilities for Covid-19 even when WHO has been saying testing is the only solution. My brother-in-law had high fever, but the labs refused home collection saying they were over-burdened. I then tweeted and posted on FB when somebody from Salt Lake put me through to a laboratory who were willing to come home and collect the sample,” said Prateek Singh, a resident of Vivekananda Road in north Kolkata.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/strangers-turn-saviours-as-distressed-kin-of-cov-patients-take-to-social-media-for-help/articleshow/82202925.cms||Zeeshan Javed

At a time when the second wave of Covid has left facilities and supplies heavily stressed across the nation, the Gorakhpur administration is confident of ensuring sufficient oxygen supply to all the covid hospitals in the district. Divisional commissioner Jayant Narlikar told TOI on Thursday, “All the Covid hospitals in Gorakhpur have a 36-hour back-up of oxygen and since cases are still rising we are trying to ensure 48-hour back-up in all the dedicated facilities.” District magistrate K. Vijyendra Pandian said, “We are making an oxygen cylinder bank at Kuchchuhry Club to ensure sufficient supply and back-up.” “NE Railway gave 500 oxygen cylinders and Hindustan Urvarak Rasayan Limited has provided 100 cylinders to the bank. We also took 300 cylinders from a non-functional unit at Gorakhpur Industrial Development Authority (GIDA) and arranged 155 cylinders from other sources. The cylinders would be filled and supplied to hospitals as per requirements,” he added. “There are three manufacturing units in Gorakhpur which are producing 2,600 oxygen cylinders per day. Besides, these we are trying to restart a non-functional manufacturing unit to augment supply,” he said. Two plants of Modi Chemical Private Limited are producing 1,600 medical oxygen cylinders per day and RK Oxygen plant at GIDA is making 1,000 cylinders daily. The district magistrate has also given instructions for making Annapurna Gas Plant at GIDA also functional which will produce 1,000 cylinders daily further boosting the supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/gorakhpur-creates-o2-cylinderbank-ensures-sufficient-supply/articleshow/82203984.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Business||Surge in Covid cases biggest recovery hurdle, says RBI governor||MUMBAI: Rapid rise in Covid cases is the single biggest challenge to the ongoing recovery in the Indian economy, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das has said, asserting that previous year’s learnings should, however, help in managing the crisis as it unfolds. “The need of the hour is to effectively secure the economic recovery underway so that it becomes broad-based and durable. The renewed jump in Covid infections in several parts of the country and the associated localised and regional lockdowns add uncertainty to the growth outlook,” the governor said in the minutes of the MPC (monetary policy committee) meeting, which was released by the RBI on Thursday. Coronavirus: Live updates“In such an environment, monetary policy should remain accommodative to support, nurture and consolidate the recovery. We need to continue to sustain the impulses of growth in the new financial year 2021-22. I vote to keep the policy rate unchanged and to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to sustain growth on a durable basis, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward,” Das had said. While the RBI expectedly kept rates on hold, it had surprised markets by announcing a Rs 1-lakh-crore government bond purchase programme, which helped bring down interest rates. While the RBI did reiterate its accommodative stance while announcing the MPC decision, a reading of the minutes emphasises the dovish stance. “Going forward, The RBI would continue to ensure ample surplus systemic liquidity and the system would remain in surplus even after meeting the requirements of all financial market segments and the productive sectors of the economy,” Das had said in the MPC meeting. He had said that indicators suggest that the real GDP was evolving on the lines of the February MPC resolution. “Improving demand conditions, investment enhancing measures by the government and improving external demand impart an upside to growth prospects. The recent jump in Covid infections and its impact on economic activity, however, needs to be watched carefully,” Das had cautioned. Deputy governor Michael Patra had also expressed concern over recovery. “Monetary policy has to remain supportive of the economy until the recovery is more sure-footed and its sustainability assured,” he said. He pointed out that risks to the recovery have become accentuated since the MPC’s February meeting with new waves of infections and the inexorably slow pace of vaccinations, moderation in several high-frequency sentiment indicators, global risks and spillovers. “The economic recovery can come under risk if this new wave of infections is not flattened soon,” said Mridul Saggar, executive director, RBI and a member of the MPC. “This is especially so as monetary and fiscal policies have already used most of their space to considerably limit the loss of economic capital, though expansion of policy toolkits can still afford additional comfort,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/surge-biggest-recovery-hurdle-says-rbi-guv/articleshow/82203946.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Mask is the best weapon to fight pandemic: Study||KOLKATA: Regulatory bodies must focus on use of mask and an extensive vaccination drive against Covid-19. A study on these lines by doctors of School of Tropical Medicine, published in the ‘Journal of Indian Medical Association (JIMA)’ is being sent to various agencies, like Kolkata Police and Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC), so they can step up the awareness drive. The research paper, titled “Mask for all; physical and immunological barrier of Covid-19”, by Shambo S Samajdar, Srijita Ghosh, Shreyashi Dasgupta and Jyotirmoy Pal, uses evidence to support the use of masks as a protective barrier to limit virus entry. “Masks and vaccination should be the focus of regulatory bodies. Our paper has shown how face mask is the best weapon to fight the pandemic,” Samajdar, clinical pharmacologist, STM, told TOI. Senior clinical pharmacologist Santanu K Tripathi and dean of Indian College of Physicians Padmashree Shashank R Joshi have contributed to the research that shows how masks indirectly help stimulate protective immune responses and provides a comparative glimpse on the characteristics of various masks. The introduction of the research, published in JIMA, reads, “Even with the emergency use authorization of vaccines, we are yet to bring the pandemic to its knees. The present scenario highlights the importance of face masks in controlling transmission of the SARS CoV2 virus.” Samajdar and his team have deduced that while a vaccine stimulates the immune system in the form of an antigen, a face mask, “shows an immense preventive role in the pandemic”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mask-is-the-best-weapon-to-fight-pandemic-study/articleshow/82202916.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Patna||Bihar: Teachers, staff scared of visiting institutions||PATNA: Even as all the schools and colleges of the state have been closed by the government in the wake of rising cases of Covid-19, teachers and non-teaching staff are supposed to report to their duties on alternate days or as directed by the authorities concerned, thereby exposing them to the deadly virus. Several teachers and staff of colleges and schools have to commute from distant places on autorickshaws or other public transport to reach their respective institutions and this increases the chances of getting infected with the virus. They hardly see any rationale behind their regular attendance in schools when there is practically no work to do. Students stay at their homes as they are being taught in online mode. Even teachers can engage their classes from home when the same are to be taken online, they say. Treasurer of Bihar Non-Gazetted Elementary Teachers’ Association Ashutosh Kumar Rakesh said the association has already requested the state education department to revise its order and prevent even one-third teachers and other staff from coming to their schools. He pointed out that those coming to their schools are in constant fear of getting infected. “At least three teachers working in schools in and around Patna have died due to Covid-19 and dozens of them have been infected. Headmasters of some schools have also got infected quite recently,” he said. Teachers and non-teaching staff of universities and colleges have also resented the government’s order for calling them at their workplaces on alternate days without any productive work. President of Patna University Teachers’ Association Shefali Roy, however, admitted that not all the teachers are coming to their respective institutions regularly as they are engaging all the assigned classes online. “There is nothing to do in the departments and even the examinations of the university have been postponed for an indefinite period,” Roy said, adding, the teachers do not want to risk their lives by visiting the colleges which are not being sanitized and kept clean. Patna University Employees’ Association president Subodh Kumar said more than two dozen staff and teachers have already been affected and the head of a postgraduate department has died of Covid-19 infection. “In such an environment, teachers and staff are quite scared of visiting their workplaces regularly,” Kumar said and demanded that the university should be completely closed till May 15 as per the government order. Working president of Bihar’s Federation of University Teachers’ Associations, Kanhaiya Bahadur Sinha, ridiculed the idea of calling teachers and non-teaching staff to their respective departments regularly when classroom teaching and university examinations have been suspended. “Heaven will not fall if the educational institutions are closed completely for a fortnight or even a month and the university staff are exempted from making attendance at their workplaces,” Sinha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/teachers-staff-scared-of-visiting-institutions/articleshow/82202548.cms||B K Mishra

---||Patna||Now, junior doctors start guiding people over phone for free||PATNA: After the Indian Medical Association, the Junior Doctors’ Association-Bihar has also released the list of 32 of its members who will provide medical assistance over phone to Covid and non-Covid patients. On the first day of the launch of tele-consultation facility on Thursday, around 480 people made calls, mostly enquiring about vaccination and precautions to be taken to keep Covid at bay. According to health experts in JDA-Bihar, 99% calls were about Covid medication, safety measures, dos and don’ts if tested positive and diet plan. Dr Harendra Kumar, JDA president of Patna Medical College and Hospital, said he received 14 calls. “We have started this facility to provide free medical advice to non-Covid patients as well. People are afraid of leaving their homes due to the pandemic. We, therefore, provide free consultation to them,” he said. Dr Kumar said the third-year PG students from different medical colleges would provide free tele-consultation from 4pm to 6pm. “Those on the list include junior doctors who are specialising in different areas,” he added. Dr Rakesh Kumar from surgery department at Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital, said people were in panic due to surge in Covid cases. “People mostly call to know what medicines they should take if they have mild to moderate symptoms,” he said. Jyotsna Singh, a resident of Kumhrar, who made a desperate call to JDA-Bihar, said her daughter had tested Covid positive on April 11 although she had no Covid symptoms. “She again tested positive on April 21, which is quiet worrisome. I have talked to the doctors and they have given some important suggestions,” she said. Uma Kant Singh (47) said as the number of Covid cases is rising in Bihar, he was now planning to get vaccine shots. “I have read about the vaccines and their efficacy. However, taking advice from health experts was important. The doctor told me to take the jab as it reduces the severity of infection,” he said. Earlier, IMA-Bihar had issued the list of 40 doctors for telemedicine services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/now-junior-doctors-start-guiding-people-over-phone-for-free/articleshow/82202578.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||Vaccines 100% safe, reduce severity of illness: Doctors||PATNA: Two Covid vaccines in use in the country – Covaxin and Covishield – have provided 100% protection against the fatal viral disease in Bihar till date. There is no report from any leading hospital of the city on hospitalisation of any person with serious complications who had taken both the vaccine doses. Though several doctors and health workers of hospitals like All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P), Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) and Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) have tested positive even after receiving two vaccine doses, their hospitalisation was not required. “Both the vaccines are 100% safe against the Covid-19 infection,” AIIMS-P director Dr P K Singh said. “There is a certain period of 42 to 45 days after the first dose when the antibodies fully develop in human body and protect people from the deadly effects of the virus. The development of antibodies begins soon after the first dose. The effective level of protection, however, comes after completion of the medically proven period,” Dr Singh added. “The common problems diagnosed with repeat infection after both doses are headache, body aches, loose motion and fever. One can overcome the complications by remaining in home isolation,” Dr Singh said, adding the institute was collecting data to find out how many health workers tested positive after receiving two vaccine doses. Dr Singh, however, expressed concern over some different symptoms being noticed in people with severe infection in the second wave. “Apprehending some new strains hitting the state in the second wave, we have sent some samples for test in a lab at Bhubaneswar,” he added. PMCH superintendent Dr I S Thakur described vaccination as the best solution to Covid problem. “Those who have received two vaccine shots are fine despite contracting the virus. They just have mild complaints like fever and headache,” he added. Dr Anil Kumar, head of the community outreach programme at AIIMS-P, said though many vaccinated people have contracted the virus, they have recovered with simple medication and isolation. “The level of antibodies formation after vaccination varies from man to man. Those with strong immunity level get higher value of antibodies developed within the fixed period,” he said, adding nutritious food and sufficient vitamins help in maintaining the immunity level. NMCH deputy superintendent Dr Satish Kumar said both the vaccines have proved safe and effective.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vaccines-100-safe-reduce-severity-of-illness-doctors/articleshow/82202587.cms||VK Tripathi

The allocations made for Bihar are for the period from April 21 to April 30. As per a letter shared by Modi on his Twitter handle, the order sent to the state government has been signed by Dr Mandeep K Bhandari, joint secretary in the Union ministry of health and family welfare and Navdeep Rinwa, joint secretary in the department of pharmaceuticals. The 24,500 Remdesivir vials allocated to Bihar include 14,000 manufactured by Zydus Cadila, 6,500 by Hetero, 1,000 by Myian, 2,000 by Cipla and 1,000 by Jubilant. The Centre has asked states to appoint a nodal officer who will be responsible for unrestricted and timely movement of Remdesivir within their states. “The Centre will also create a WhatsApp group of all the state nodal officers to facilitate proper coordination among them,” he said.

Defending CM Nitish Kumar’s decision to impose night curfew as a precautionary measure, JD(U) MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lallan Singh said whenever the CM feels the need to impose lockdown, he will do it. The Munger MP, who is considered close to Nitish, said the CM was reviewing the situation arising out of resurgence of Covid-19 pandemic on a regular basis. “Whatever is required, he will do at an appropriate time,” he added. Without mentioning the name of state BJP chief Sanjay Jaiswal, the JD(U) leader said leaders who want to hog the limelight issue unnecessary statements. Apparently not satisfied with the government’s decision to impose night curfew, Jaiswal had demanded two-day weekend lockdown in the state to check the spread of the virus. Jaiswal’s remarks came soon after the night curfew was imposed from 9pm to 5am on April 18. The BJP MP from Bettiah had turned to social media to express his reactions to the government’s decision. “Sanjay Jaiswal Ji, abhi rajnitik vyanbaji ka waqt nahi hai (It’s not time to make political statements),” newly-inducted JD(U) member Upendra Kushwaha had tweeted. On Wednesday, BJP leader and state panchayati raj department minister Samrat Choudhary had defended Jaiswal on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-bjp-war-of-words-over-curbs-continues/articleshow/82202661.cms||Ramashankar

The district authorities have created 478 micro-containment zones in Patna under 49 police station areas. Kankerbagh has emerged as the biggest hotspot with 479 active cases. The number of micro-containment areas has nearly quadrupled in two weeks from 103 to 478 as of Thursday. According to data shared by the district administration, there are 301 reported active cases in Shastri Nagar, closely followed by 284 in Rupaspur, Kadamkuan (272), Phulwarisharif (266), Rajeev Nagar (229), Jakanpur (216), 214 each in Gardanibagh and Rajeev Nagar, Danapur (205), Agamkuan (202), Buddha Colony (194) and SK Puri (193). Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal told this newspaper that frequent sanitization of the containment areas was being done.

---||Kolkata||Job doesn’t end with issuing circulars, Calcutta HC tears into Election Commission||KOLKATA: The Calcutta High Court told the Election Commission on Thursday that its responsibility did not end with merely “issuing circulars” and “holding meetings”. It would step in and “act like TN Seshan”, the HC said, if the EC failed to enforce Covid-safety protocols during electioneering in Bengal. Seshan, the tough Chief Election Commissioner between 1990 and 1996, had strictly enforced the model code of conduct and ushered in a host of electoral reforms. “Issuing circulars and holding meetings by themselves do not discharge the onerous responsibility of the EC,” a division bench of Chief Justice Thottathil B. Radhakrishnan and Justice Arijit Banerjee said, adding that it was “unable to reconcile (with) the fact” that the EC was unable to give any “update on action... (and) enforcement” of its own circulars. The bench then directed the EC to respond “with a very short affidavit” on Friday morning and observed that the poll panel could not just frame rules and ask people to adhere to them while its officers sat “in their chambers”. It was not “satisfied” with the steps taken by the EC, the HC said in its order. “We are sure that the circulars are not merely advisories to be wrapped up by political parties or those involved in political propaganda or even the public at large,” the court added. Bengal chief electoral officer Aariz Aftab earlier this week submitted a detailed response to the high court on the Covid-safety measures the EC had taken, which included a ban on campaigning between 7pm and 10am. The affidavit also mentioned the guidelines given to parties and their star campaigners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/job-doesnt-end-with-issuing-circulars-hc-tears-into-ec/articleshow/82204635.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Business||Housing demand recovery surprisingly strong: Deepak Parekh||MUMBAI: Demand for housing has surprised on the upside, however, it is structural and here to stay, said HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh. He said demand for larger homes in alternate locations due to the shift to work-from-home and the PM Awas Yojana, under which over 1 crore homes have been bought, are among major drivers. “In my 44 years of working in the housing sector, I must say the strong demand that one has seen for housing in the recent period has certainly surprised on the upside. Growth in home loans has been aided by low-interest rates, softer or stable property prices and continued fiscal benefits on home loans,” the head of the country’s largest mortgage lender said, speaking at the One World One Realty Global PropTech Summit 2021. Parekh added that the housing demand structural, not pent-up, and it is here to stay. On the global economy, Parekh said the massive liquidity infusion to deal with the impact of the pandemic has pushed up prices of financial assets. “Governments across the world are conscious that they have to safeguard against any build-up of asset bubbles. That is why governments in several countries are focusing on increasing investments in real assets. Building infrastructure is one way to ensure a sustained recovery, without spiralling inflation. Building infrastructure also creates a massive number of jobs and has multiplier effects on the economy,” said Parekh. “India’s latest Budget bets big on growth. India sees the benefits of construction-led recovery, which is why the infrastructure outlay in the Budget is at an all-time high. The National Infrastructure Pipeline envisages over 6,500 infrastructure projects with investments of over Rs 111 lakh crore over five years. Resources for this of course will need to be a combination of public and private investment. So clearly, construction and real estate development is going to play a key role in all major global economies,” said Parekh. According to Parekh, the use of technology in the real estate sector will improve governance by enabling real-time data, including the progress of a project on digital dashboards. “Funding for projects based on achieving construction milestones can be better monitored online. This will bring in much-needed transparency and accountability, and improve cost efficiencies in the sector,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/housing-demand-recovery-surprisingly-strong-parekh/articleshow/82203882.cms||---

While it is usual for insurers to inquire about pre-existing diseases before selling a health cover, Covid has made insurers turn cautious as they its long-term impact on organs is not known. While rising incidents makes it a stronger case for people to buy health insurance before infection strikes, insurers say that often it is hospitalisation that makes people realise the need for a medical policy. Coronavirus: Live updatesThe quotes that health insurers provide for various ages are for “standard proposals” or those without pre-existing conditions. In the case of Covid, insurers treat it as a pre-existing condition and acceptance of the proposal depends on each company’s underwriting criteria. While the underwriting criteria are not made public, industry sources say that these range from requiring Covid negative certificate to asking applicants to wait between two-to-six months before onboarding them. If the patient is hospitalised and suffered damage to lungs, they could face exclusions. “Considering the rapid spread of new variant of Covid, it is hard to say anything about the long-term effects of it. Most insurers are a bit iffy about on-boarding customers who have just recovered from Covid, as a result insurer put a cooling off period of 3-6 months after Covid detection,” said Amit Chhabra, head of health insurance at Policybazaar.com. According to Rashmi Nandargi, head of retail health insurance underwriting at Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, for 80% of Covid survivors, it should not be a problem because they have mild symptoms, and they are under home quarantine. “For those who are hospitalised, the acceptance will depend on how severe the infection has been, whether any organs were impacted, whether the person has been on the ventilator,” said Nandargi. Chhabra points out that given the rate at which Covid is spreading, it is advisable for all to invest in health insurance and not wait as it may become difficult to get cover immediately after recovering from Covid. “Even after a person is discharged, medical protocol says that they must be tested and get a Covid negative report to be declared Covid-free. That itself takes a few weeks. After the report, the proposal is assessed based on whether there have been any other conditions and severity of the infection,” said Nandargi, adding that all should buy health insurance as a risk-mitigation tool.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/covid-survivors-buying-health-cover-for-1st-time-face-scrutiny/articleshow/82203847.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Muzaffarpur-based senior paediatrician Dr Arun Shah said since youths venture out of homes for work, they are unknowingly getting infected with the virus and becoming its carrier. “Vaccine might not protect the youths fully, but help them in escaping the severity of the infection. Young people will face less vaccine side effects as they have strong immune system,” Dr Shah added. Aditi Prakash (25), an IT professional and resident of Gardanibagh, said, “The government has done the right thing by making Covid vaccines available for the young people.” Shianjany Pradhan (21), an undergraduate student, said, “I will take the jab as I have read the reviews of effectiveness of vaccines. They are very effective and reduce the severity of the infection.” Sanya Shekhar (20), another undergraduate student, said, “The vaccines will help us fight the disease and boost immunity. Youths must get vaccinated and avoid being a carrier of the virus.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/youths-keen-to-get-vaccine-shots/articleshow/82202531.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar: Several universities being run by officiating VCs||PATNA: Is Bihar facing acute dearth of academic administrators? Prima facie it seems so as one academic has been asked to serve as the vice-chancellor of as many as three universities simultaneously. When Maulana Mazharul Haq Arabic and Persian University (MMHAPU)’s vice-chancellor Khalid Mirza completed his three-year-tenure on Friday, L N Mithila University (LNMU) VC Surendra Pratap Singh was appointed the acting VC of this university. Prof Singh has already been officiating as the Patliputra University VC ever since Gulab Chand Ram Jaiswal resigned in January this year. At least seven universities of the state are being managed by ‘officiating’ VCs and, in many cases, one person is managing two universities simultaneously. When Ranjit Kumar Verma completed his three-year-term as Munger University VC on March 19 this year, Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University VC Neelima Gupta was handed over its additional charge. Purnea University’s pro-VC R N Yadav has been officiating as its VC since Rajesh Singh resigned from the post in September last year. Nalanda Open University is also being managed by B R A Bihar University VC Hanuman Prasad Pandey since H N Prasad resigned in November last year. Aryabhatta Knowledge University (AKU), which was established with much fanfare in 2010 with a view to imparting quality education in all the professional courses of the state, does not have a regular VC after Dr A K Agrawal completed his three-year-tenure on September 20 last year. Its pro-VC S M Karim has been officiating as its VC since then. And, Karim will also be completing his tenure in June this year. Bihar Agricultural University (BAU), Sabour, has also no regular VC. BAU’s director (extension) R K Sohana has been officiating as its VC since the resignation of Ajoy Kumar Singh early this year. Raj Bhavan sources said the chancellor’s secretariat has already initiated necessary steps for making regular appointments against the vacant posts, but the things are getting somewhat delayed owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. More than a couple of months back, the chancellor’s secretariat has invited applications for the appointment of VCs of Munger, Patliputra and Maulana Mazharul Haq Arabic and Persian universities and the pro-VCs of Munger, Nalanda Open and Veer Kunwar Singh universities. Earlier, the post of Nalanda Open University’s VC was advertised by the chancellor’s Secretariat in January itself. And, the post of Aryabhatta Knowledge University (AKU)’s VC was re-advertised in January this year. The process of constituting search committees and scrutinizing applications and holding interviews of the short-listed candidates would be taken up shortly, sources added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/several-varsities-being-run-by-officiating-vcs/articleshow/82202362.cms||B K Mishra

Raushan Ram, (35), a resident of Bhavdeopur Ambedkar Nagar, was spotted in an unconscious state near the factory godown under Riga police station around 10 pm on Wednesday. He was rushed to a hospital where the doctors declared him dead. The victim's father, Harishchandra Ram, said Raushan worked at the leather godown as a daily wager for the past several years. He had left home early in the morning but was found dead late in the evening. He alleged that his son had been killed. The deceased's father, who earlier worked at the leather godown, told the police that marks of external injuries were found on his son's body, which suggested that he had been murdered. He demanded a thorough investigation. As the news about Raushan's death spread in the area on Thursday morning, several people from Ambedkar Colony assembled on the road near the go-down, ransacked the shops and business establishment. They also indulged in arson and set several vehicles on fire. On getting information, Sitamarhi SP Hari Kishore Rai rushed to the spot with reinforcements. He pacified the crowd by giving assurance that justice would be done to the family. The body was removed from the spot and sent to the Sadar hospital for post mortem on the SP's assurance. Rai later told reporters in Sitamarhi that action would be taken in the case based on the autopsy report, which is awaited. “Those involved in causing damage to the property will also be booked,” he said, adding that nobody can be allowed to take the law into their hands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/fatory-workers-death-sparks-protest-in-sitamarhi/articleshow/82202305.cms||Ramashankar

During a meeting of the TRIPS Council, which is discussing India and South Africa’s joint proposal for flexibility in the patent regime to facilitate access to vaccines in poorer countries, especially Africa, the Indian delegation made it clear that the existing approach of voluntary licences could only deliver vaccines to 4% of the global population, sources familiar with the deliberations told TOI. “Could members who claim that voluntary licences are working explain how and from where the current requirements will be met?” the Indian delegation is learnt to have said, while drawing attention to the untapped production potential in the developing world. “Getting the intellectual property and technology transfer dimension right is critical to unlocking this potential, along with a range of other practical logistical, financial, and regulatory challenges,” it said. Sources said, South Africa slammed developed countries for purchasing vaccine supplies at a level sufficient to vaccinate their whole population several times over. “Most of these countries have vaccinated between 10% and 50% of their populations with at least one dose, and as of today many of these countries are in the process of purchasing additional doses for 2022, even as most developing countries are struggling to vaccinate even 5% of their population,” sources said. The outburst came after the EU, the UK and Switzerland said moves aimed at “undermining or upending IPRs is a no-go” area. Developed countries have blocked any move to dilute the current patent regime to help boost supply of vaccines to the poor countries, although India and South Africa’s joint proposal has the support of some 120 WTO members. At the meeting, South Africa indicated the joint proposal may be updated in the coming days, with consultations underway with other countries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/trips-meet-india-s-africa-to-rework-patent-proposal/articleshow/82203832.cms||---

The pharma company, owned by Mahendra Kshirsagar, is expected to start the market release of the drug in another two to three weeks with an optimum production of around 30,000 vials per day. US-based Gilead Sciences had licensing agreement with seven Indian pharmaceutical companies including Hetero Labs to produce Remdesivir. Genetek, which already produces several life-saving drugs, was granted FDA permission following the initiative of Union minister Nitin Gadkari. The proposal of Genetek to manufacture the anti-viral drug was also cleared by the drugs controller general of India earlier. Chetan Marwah, principal correspondent of Genetek, said, “We have started procurement of raw materials, active and inactive ingredients from parent company.” “The vials, the printing of the packages and labels too has started,” said Marwah claiming that the entire machinery was geared up for the production. “It will take around a fortnight or so to launch the product in the market. In mock runs, the production capacity may fluctuate but in the long run it would 30,000 per day. The drug would be released in the market through proper channel,” he said. Marwah also said there would be no compromise on quality though some of the lengthier processes are likely to be shortened for a quicker release of the drugs needed to fight the pandemic. “The drug would be put through all necessary and mandatory tests and trials before release,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/wardha-cos-remdesivir-to-be-in-market-in-two-weeks/articleshow/82203955.cms||Soumitra Bose

This is American investor Tiger Global’s first investment in an Indian cryptocurrency firm and the round helps the four-year old startup grow its valuation by 5x in just three months. In January 2021, CoinSwitch Kuber raised $15 million in Series A funding from fintech and crypto investor Ribbit Capital, San-Francisco based crypto focused investment firm Paradigm and Sequoia Capital India, and was valued at around $100 million then. The startup -that aims to make crypto investment “as smooth as ordering food online” — plans to use the funds to ramp up the product and its security capabilities. It also has plans to invest in brand building and increasing awareness around cryptocurrencies as an emerging asset class and enter into new asset classes. Ashish Singhal, co-founder and CEO CoinSwitch Kuber, said that the financing from Tiger Global happened despite the regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency in India and the investment brings them ‘at par’ with global cryptocurrency companies. “We are looking to hire top talent across technology, operations, marketing, product and compliance teams. We plan to increase headcount from around 135 to 250-300 by end of the year,” he said.“As they build India’s leading cryptocurrency platform, CoinSwitch is well positioned to capture the tremendous growing interest in crypto among retail investors,” Scott Shleifer, Partner, Tiger Global, said.Three out of the four investors of CoinSwitch have also backed global crypto major Coinbase, which saw a bumper Nasdaq listing last week. Founded in 2017 by Ashish Singhal, Govind Soni and Vimal Sagar Tiwari as a global aggregator of cryptocurrency exchanges, the company pivoted to a crypto investment platform for retail investors in India called CoinSwitch Kuber in June 2020.The platform claims a 350% growth in user base since January and counts over 4.5 million users in India. It crossed $5 billion in transaction volume in March and targets to onboard 10 million users this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/coinswitch-kuber-raises-25-m-from-tiger-global/articleshow/82203844.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

Regular social media users have swung into action to help out those in need by crowdsourcing information about critical Covid-19 resources, such as ventilator beds, ambulance, oxygen cylinders, plasma donors and drugs like Ramdesivir. In many cases, these information have saved lives. Abhinav Vats, an IT professional, said he succeeded in sourcing an oxygen cylinder from a contact via social media. “I contacted a supplier whose number I got from a social media thread and collected oxygen cylinder from him for my uncle,” he said. Abhimanyu Singh, a bank employee, said he was contacted for plasma donation through social media. “A follower reached out to me and sought help to get plasma. I had helped him out through my contacts,” he said. Users are amplifying SOS messages and connecting people to leads. “I post leads and verified contacts for supply of Covid resources. It’s the least I can do to help people in this dire situation,” said Priyanshi Singh, a student of Patna Women’s College. Mehul Singh, manager of an education technology company, believes that social media is the best way to reach out to masses. “At a time when our health system is failing us and people are in critical condition, social media is helping people who do not have influences and have run out of options,” he said. Some people, however, have also opined that hoaxes and fake messages are disheartening hopeful people looking for help through social media. Arun Kumar, a resident of Buddha Colony, said, “Not even 2% of contacts mentioned on social media platforms are real or helpful. The hoaxes acting as suppliers extract money from people.” Priyanka, a resident of Kankarbagh, said filtering information on social media is a challenge. “Out of a sea of information that’s available, sorting out the relevant ones is a task which requires time,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/social-media-platforms-come-to-rescue-of-many-in-distress/articleshow/82202503.cms||---

Duplicate sanitizers worth over Rs 10 lakh were seized from a shop on Vasna Road and another in Raopura area. The accused Nitin Kotwani, who was arrested on Tuesday, had sold this stock to the shops. Kotwani earned a profit of about Rs 10 crores in last 10 months by selling duplicate sanitizers across the state, said police.  “We are now focussing on the traders to whom Kotwani had sold the duplicate sanitizers. We will seize all the stock as the sanitizers made in Kotwani’s unit are dangerous for human health,” said Shamsher Singh, city police commissioner. The sanitizers made at Kotwani’s manufacturing unit had a big quantity of methanol that is a hazardous chemical.  Police are also trying to track down the suppliers who gave him methanol in such large quantity. Methanol is an industrial solvent and one can’t acquire it without proper permissions. “Kotwani revealed the name of one Ashok Patel, owner of Maruti Chem Product and claimed that the latter supplied him methanol. Our team reached the address given by Kotwani but Patel wasn’t found there. In fact, Patel wasn’t staying there for a year. It is possible that Kotwani is misleading the cops,” Singh added.  Investigating officials are also scanning the bank account number of Kotwani’s firm to find out how much money he made and where has he diverted it. “Efforts are on to check if the license that Kotwani has to make sanitiser is authentic. We will also track down the other persons involved in the racket,” Singh said.  The PCB had on Tuesday raided Kotwani’s manufacturing unit in Gorwa BIDC and seized duplicate sanitiser stock worth Rs 45 lakh. Samples of the sanitizers were sent for FSL tests and results revealed that it had methanol ranging from 20 to 70 per cent. Kotwani told the police that he replaced ethanol with methanol that is much cheaper in price.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/duplicate-sanitizer-maker-earned-rs-10cr-in-10-months/articleshow/82202437.cms||---

The Zee chairman emeritus issued a statement following rumours that Goel could lose grip over Dish TV on possible loan defaults by Chandra. Chandra’s office claimed that loans have been repaid and expects the pledge over Dish TV shares to be released. Goel owns 7.3% of Dish TV, a leading direct-to-home (D2H) company in India, and had offered a substantial portion of that as security for loans raised by Chandra. A rice trader-turned-media magnate, Chandra ran into financial difficulties due to bets on the infrastructure sector. While thanking Goel for his support, Chandra said he is fully committed to return the Dish TV security to his younger brother. “Goel has no financial stress whatsoever in his personal capacity,” Chandra said. In 2009, the younger Goel gained control over Dish TV following a business restructuring between the brothers. Chandra also said that he has resolved majority of the financial issues and is on “a steady path to iron out the limited pending issues”. In 2019, he sold most of his holdings in Zee, India’s largest publicly traded TV network, to lower debt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/dish-tv-shares-pledged-to-rescue-zees-chandra/articleshow/82203789.cms||---

The seizure was made in an operation which began on Wednesday late night and continued through the early hours of Thursday. According to police, follow-up investigation by Udayamperoor police into the seizure of fake currency amounting to Rs 1.74 lakh on March 27 led the police to the Coimbatore gang. City police commissioner Nagaraju Chakilam said that the inputs from DIG Anup Kuruvila John who heads the ATS of the state police was instrumental in the operation. The arrested have been identified as Rasheed from Thrissur, Syed Sultan and Ashraf Ali from Coimbatore and two others who were arrested in the early hours of Thursday. With this, the total number of arrested persons in the Udayamperoor fake currency case has risen to nine. Police have also seized scanners and printers from the accused. The seized fake currencies were in the denomination of Rs 2,000. Senior officers said that the accused had circulated about 90 currencies of Rs 2,000 denomination at various places and the sleuths tracked and seized each one of those bills. The core members of the racket used to provide two Rs 2,000 fake notes to the secondary links for a single original currency note of the same denomination. The case pertains to Udayamperoor police arresting two persons with fake currency worth Rs 1.74 lakh in March. The seized currencies were also in the denomination of Rs 2,000. Two people Priyankumar K K, 36, of Irumbanam in Tripunithura and Dhanya, 38, of Karunagappilly were arrested then. Priyankumar had then given a statement to police that he got the fake currency from Coimbatore. Police said that after the arrest of the first two accused, a follow-up probe led them to two more accused then itself. Later on, a Thrissur native was arrested the other day, which led the police to four more in Coimbatore. Police said there were 9,000 notes in the denomination of Rs 2,000 and the notes were kept in 90 bundles of 100 notes each. Even as there is a possibility of a national security angle arising considering the huge quantity of the seizure and the participation of the ATS, sources, however, said that prima facie the rackets seem to be driven by financial interests. Police will probe if the accused have any other connections as the investigation progresses, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/police-seize-fake-currency-worth-rs-1-8-crore-5-arrested/articleshow/82202238.cms||---

A large number of vehicles that were stuck in Lahaul since April 4 due to snowfall were sent towards Leh on Tuesday early morning. While Border Roads Organisation (BRO), Lahaul-Spiti police and administration helped in crossing of the many vehicles across snow-bound Baralacha pass, others got stuck on both sides of Baralacha due to sudden snowfall, slipping on road and breakdown. All attempts to evacuate vehicles failed due to fresh snowfall and low visibility. Even the vehicle of superintendent of police (SP) got stuck which was taken down to Zingzingbar after many efforts. The rescue team could rescue only 147 passengers on Tuesday. As snowfall did not stop and over 100cm of fresh snow had accumulated on existing 150cm to 400cm thick layer of snow, moving the remaining passengers to safety at low altitude camp at several kilometres away seemed to be almost impossible. Even worse was that the area was struck by many avalanches. There was snowfall forecast till Friday, so BRO officials and jawans had to make a difficult decision to continue the rescue operation on Wednesday evening and then all night amid deadly snow storms and bone-chilling cold. BRO’s 38 Border Road Task Force (BRTF) commander Col Uma Shankar said, “The stranded people included truck drivers, migrant labourers, women and children. 17 people had been rescued from Baralacha top on Tuesday. Blizzards, snowfall and poor visibility delayed our rescue operations. After two failed attempts, the rescue team finally succeeded in reaching the stranded people at about 4pm on Wednesday. The operation continued throughout the night and remaining 87 people were rescued at 5am on Thursday.” He added that the whole rescue operation continued for more than 30 hours amid one of the heaviest snowfall spells of the season. “The whole area was struck with avalanches. Not caring for their own lives, our men walked for many kilometres from Sarchu and Zingzingbar camps to Baralacha in the night. The 87 rescued people include two women and four children. They were moved to Zingzingbar camp of BRO where they were provided with food and shelter. Two persons have suffered chilblains and are being given treatment. All of them have now been shifted to Jispa village,” he added. Lahaul-Spiti deputy commissioner Pankaj Rai said as many as 244 people have been rescued from Baralacha in the last three days. “Ten truck drivers who have stuck between Baralacha and Sarchu have refused to come and have decided to stay in the trucks. We are taking care of food for at least 1,000 people for last 20 days. As the area is isolated and has no telephone connectivity, we were in contact with help of satellite phone,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/234-stuck-in-snow-storm-rescued-after-30-hr-baralacha-operation/articleshow/82203961.cms||Suresh Sharma

Though a high number of patients recovered, the tally decreased to 6,314 after posting a promising 7,266 within a day. This was the second-highest number of recoveries seen so far and within a span of one day. For the second time this week, Covid deaths crossed the 100-mark with Nagpur rural recording perhaps its highest ever toll of 45 out of the 110 fatalities in the district. The city saw 58 deaths. Seven were from out of the district and passed away here. At 75, the city had recorded its highest toll ever on April 19. The surge in Covid deaths took April’s toll to 1,587. Last year, September held the record for the highest deaths at 1,465. The 22 days of April have accounted for 1,24,895 cases which is the highest ever seen in any month since the pandemic started. The district’s active caseload increased to an all-time high of 72,477, with more than 9,000 patients admitted in hospitals and CCCs. As compared to a day earlier, the city saw a dip in daily cases. According to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) data, 4,619 cases were reported on Thursday as against 4,787 on Wednesday. A sharp jump of over 300 cases shot up the rural day’s tally to 2718, which also ultimately took the district figures to a new high. The 2,718 fresh cases in rural parts were detected from 5,309 tests, making up for a 51.19 positivity rate. This comes at a time when the health infrastructure is badly stressed with patient load in periphery areas. The rural toll is also an indication of many patients not getting timely hospital admission, oxygen or necessary medication, officials said. The city’s new cases were detected from 16,276 samples, for a positivity rate of 28.37%, which is much lower than the rural. The district has also crossed 20 lakh tests but it officials feel it can’t be assumed that half the population has now been tested. Healthcare workers and frontline workers have to prefer repeated testing which are part of the tally as on date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/recoveries-remain-high-despite-dip-as-cases-surge-again/articleshow/82203965.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The court, which had completed the trial in the case months ago, had to postpone the pronouncement of verdict multiple times following the failure of the accused to turn up on judgment day. Kasaba police arrested her from the house of her relative at Kattakada early in the morning and produced her in court which remanded her in custody till April 27, when the verdict in the case against her will be pronounced. Though Saritha pleaded before the court to grant her bail on medical grounds, JFCM court III judge Nimmi K K turned it down and remanded her in custody and directed that she be provided medical aid, if needed. She has been remanded to Kannur Central prison. Public prosecutor Geoffrey George Joseph opposed the bail plea saying that Saritha had repeatedly disregarded the directives of the court and had warrants against her in six courts, including in Ranni and Thiruvalla. In February, the court had cancelled her bail and issued a non-bailable arrest warrant after she failed to appear before it when the court was to pronounce its verdict in a case on Feb 11. With Saritha repeatedly failing to appear in court, it had to subsequently postpone the date of pronouncement of its verdict thrice. On April 16, the court had postponed the case to April 27 and had asked district police chief A V George to arrest Saritha and produce her in court. The case pertains to the complaint filed by Abdul Majeed, the owner of Associated Steels Yard, who alleged that Saritha, along with first accused Biju Radhakrishnan, took a payment of Rs 42.7 lakh after promising him a franchise of Team Solar company to distribute solar panels, lighting equipment and water heaters, besides installing solar panels in his house and office.  The third accused B Manimon was charged for forging documents to dupe the businessman. The chargesheet was filed in Dec 2013 and the trial began in Jan 2016. It is learnt that Radhakrishnan had earlier secured bail in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/saritha-held-for-failure-to-appear-before-court/articleshow/82202250.cms||---

Altogether 15 lakh plus doses will be procured at a cost of over Rs 60 crore. The vaccines will be administered free of cost to people between the 18-45 age group,” CM Pramod Sawant tweeted on Thursday The cost of vaccine will be Rs 400 per dose. He said that the government will not provide vaccines to private hospitals. “We are committed towards the welfare and good health of all Goans,” Sawant said in the tweet. The chief minister said that he took his second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at the Sakhali community health centre (CHC) on Thurday. “Once again I urge all eligible citizens to get vaccinated and strengthen the fight against this pandemic,” he said. The state government is focusing on completing Covid-19 vaccination drive at the earliest. As there was poor response to the vaccination drive for citizens above the age of 45, the state government organised Tika Utsav across Goa after Prime Minister Narendra Modi advised the states to speed up vaccination for those in the age group. Even as the state is witnessing a spike in Covid-19, as of now over 2.1 lakh people above the age of 45 have been administered the first dose of the vaccine. In the same age group, over 54,000 people have taken second dose of the vaccine. The state presently has an over 15 lakh population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/free-vaccines-for-those-in-18-45-yrs-age-group-cm/articleshow/82205201.cms||---

The council that discussed the 2018 UGC regulations on Wednesday has concluded that the new norms failed to give due weightage to the academic merit of the candidates as it used to as per the 2010 UGC regulations. The committees concerned and the state government should bring the new procedure under scrutiny and take steps to make appropriate changes in the selection criteria, the council meeting chaired by KU vice-chancellor M Mahadevan Pillai said. According to the 2018 UGC regulations, the academic merit, publications, additional qualifications and teaching experience of candidates would be considered only for shortlisting candidates. The final selection of a candidate to the post of assistant professor is entirely based on the score a candidate earns in the interview. This has led to several controversies in the recent years as universities were accused of giving higher marks to the kith and kin of political leaders of influence. “By focusing only on the performance of candidate in the interview, the academic eligibility of the candidate gets a backseat. The selection process gives the appointing authorities more freedom. But such freedom could equally invite criticism,” said Pillai. Meanwhile, save education campaign committee (SECC) chairman R S Sasikumar who levelled charge of nepotism in the assistant professor selection in a few state universities said he was fully in agreement with the concerns expressed by the academic council. “In fact, it is the misuse of the provisions in the 2018 UGC regulation that led to the appointment of the spouses of several CPM leaders in assistant professor posts in various universities. Under the influence of political leadership, universities can lower cut off marks to shortlist a candidate of political choice and then grant him/her the highest mark in the interview,” Sasikumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ku-council-worried-over-new-ugc-norms/articleshow/82207430.cms||B S Anilkumar

A division bench of Justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi passed the order while hearing a public interest litigation filed by V Rajan, president of Silayaneri revenue village water resource conservation field. According to the petitioner, when the 100-acre Silayaneri tank reaches full capacity, the excess water will flow through a channel to Silayaneri oorani. Under the kudimaramath scheme, the channel was desilted and several saplings planted on the bunds of the oorani. However, he said the excess water is now being diverted by a few people to the adjacent drain. Due to this, water doesn’t reach Silayaneri oorani and the saplings planted started to wither. He stated that though he had submitted several representations to the authorities, no steps were taken in this regard. Hence, he moved HC Madurai bench seeking to ensure water flow from the tank to Silayaneri oorani in order to safeguard the saplings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-in-hc-to-ensure-water-flow-to-oorani/articleshow/82203966.cms||---

---||India||Election Commission seeks report on two cases of ‘firing’ by forces||BAGDAH/ASHOKENAGAR: The Election Commission has sought reports into two incidents of firing in North 24 Parganas during polls on Thursday: the first by the state police, in which two people were injured, and the other an allegation of firing by central forces. The former incident, at Bagdah, was confirmed by the cops, while the district administration denied the latter, at Ashokenagar, as “a rumour”. According to a district police officer, a police patrol came under attack by a 150-strong mob, injuring three policemen when they tried to break up a clash. In the latter incident, the EC has sought a report on how two people received bullet injuries as the administration said the reports were a rumour. The Bagdah incident happened when the police responded to a clash at Ranoghat. “A 150-strong mob, armed with iron rods, bamboo sticks and sharp weapons attacked the sector office,” said a police officer. “A police team tried to disperse the mob when it started pelting stones, leaving three cops injured. The cops had to open fire in the air to disperse the mob,” he added. Two people were injured. At Ashokenagar, trouble broke out over the ransack of a BJP camp office. TMC and BJP supporters clashed. Two people were injured, and allegations began to fly that it was CISF men that had opened fire, a charge denied by the district administration. “Both groups hurled bombs at each other near the booth,” said a resident, adding, “A police vehicle and a bus ferrying polling officers were also severely damaged during the clash. After being alerted, the central forces jawans rushed to the spot to disperse the mob, failing which they opened fire, in which two persons were injured .” The injured persons identified as Khabirul Hossain and Sheikh Sujauddin, both with bullet injuries in their legs. Ashokenagar TMC candidate Narayan Goswami claimed both the injured persons were his party supporters. “The central forces deliberately opened fire at our supporters, leaving injured two of them. They have been admitted to a nursing home in Barasat. I have lodged a complaint with the Election Commission against the firing,” Goswami said. Sumit Gupta, DM, North 24 Parganas, denied allegations of firing. “We have already looked into the matter and spoken to officials manning the booth. Nothing firing has happened. We suspect that it was just a rumour,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/election-commission-seeks-report-on-two-cases-of-firing-by-forces/articleshow/82206129.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

The firemen plugged the leakage in the oxygen pipeline and saved 40 patients on oxygen support at the hospital. A senior official from the NMC’s fire department said the incident took place around 4pm. NMC’s superintending engineer Manoj Talekwar said a nasal release valve had developed snag and it interrupted the supply of oxygen to a few patients. “The oxygen supply was regulated after carrying out necessary repairs,” he said. Following a spike in coronavirus cases in the city, the civic body had converted Ayush Hospital into a 40 oxygen bed unit and started admitting Covid-19 patients. Hariharsinh Gaherwar, an eyewitness, told TOI he received a call from his brother Maheshsinh, who was admitted in the hospital about sudden dip in oxygen supply. Without wasting time, he rushed to the hospital and witnessed a panic among patients and their relatives due to leakage in oxygen pipeline. Gaherwar then called fireman from NMC’s fire and emergency services department Jagdish Bais, whose relative too was admitted at the same hospital. Bais and doctors found the pipeline with one valve leaking in the hospital backyard. Bais summoned Sudhakar Gavai, a technician from the fire department, who too reached within 10 minutes. He stopped the cylinder supply. Bais and other relatives moved at least 15 jumbo oxygen cylinders to the Covid ward situated on the first floor of the two-storey building. “We ensured not a single life was lost due to non-supply of oxygen,” he said adding the ward boys and nurses at the hospital helped connecting the oxygen cylinders to resume supply. Though the fire department made temporary arrangements, the work to repair the damaged nozzle was on. Meanwhile, superintending engineer Manoj Talewar said the damaged parts will be replaced. Patients’ relatives wondered why no technician was there to monitor the oxygen supply when the incident took place. They also raised the question over the quality of work. Additional municipal commissioners Ram Joshi, Sanjay Nipane, Talewar and chief fire officer Rajendra Uchake visited the hospital. All Safe and Sound * 4 pm Covid-patients sensed dip in oxygen supply * Informed relatives * NMC’s fire department called * Doctors, nursing staff, fireman swung into action * Firemen with technician reached and plugged the leakage * Oxygen cylinders shifted to Covid floor and supply resumed * All 42 patients safe||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/firemen-plug-o2-pipe-leak-in-nmc-hosp-save-42-covid-19-patients/articleshow/82203970.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

After a lockdown, when the city’s transport lifeline resumed services on September 14, last year, only 21,336 commuters used Metro, which ran 110 services. On Wednesday, 258 services were operational—the highest in the pandemic—and 1,79,524 people travelled in the north-south corridor. The carrier had clocked 2,81,482 footfalls on March 19 with 252 services. But ridership has fallen steadily over the past few weeks as Covid cases started rising. In pre-Covid era, around 6.5lakh people took the Metro when its daily fleet of 288 was operational. As Covid cases started dipping a few months ago, Metro authorities had planned to return to the pre-pandemic services and had even announced that tokens would be reintroduced. With the 4km Dakshineswar stretch being added to the country’s oldest Metro corridor, daily commuter count was likely to go up and the carrier seemed veered towards a 3-lakh ridership. At that time, around 2.7lakh people travelled by Metro on a week day by 252 services. The Metro had even announced that it would start issuing tokens from March 15. Since tokens would mean more commuters, Metro added services from 244 to 252 and also extended operation hours. From April 12, six more services were added on the north-south line. But around that time, the second Covid-19 wave started hitting other states, such as Maharashtra, and the daily infection graph in Bengal also saw a steady rise. On March 31, Metro deferred its decision to issue tokens and continued to allow only smartcard-users on board. By this time, Bengal had started registering around 700 Covid cases a day. As a precaution, it also announced that anyone entering a station or boarding a train without a mask would be fined Rs 200 under the Disaster Management Act. By April 16, ridership dropped to 2,45,688 people. The East-West Metro, which had breached 1,000-mark in March, had a reduced passenger count of 719. When Metro resumed services on September 14, Kolkata’s Line 2, which then ran along a truncated Sector V-Salt Lake Stadium stretch, only clocked 83 footfalls. On Wednesday, 534 people took the East-West Metro.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/metro-rider-count-drops-from-2-8l-to-1-8l-in-a-month/articleshow/82203996.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

The images show badly damaged beds with the sponge exposed, no bed spreads and an unclean toilet with a damaged door.“I was made to wait for an hour before being admitted and taken to the Covid ward on Wednesday morning. We were asked to sit on beds that were torn and did not have bedspreads. Despite requests we were not given bed spreads till 2 pm. No doctor attended to us and the nurse was unmindful if we complained about the condition,” he said.He said they were served rice made of grains sold at PDS outlets, accompanied by plain sambar and a spoonful of greens. “Under these circumstances they are also not allowing us to opt for home quarantine,” he complained. He said the ward with 40 beds had a lone woman who had to share the toilet with the men.Hospital superintendent A Kamalavasan told TOI that the faults were rectified on Wednesday night. “We have the required stock of bed spreads and other essentials but they could not be supplied as the hospital’s chief pharmacist in-charge of the supplies tested positive a couple of days ago,” he said.“We are not authorised to allow a patient who has been admitted to be sent for home quarantine.

A leopard cub that was lounging in a desolate godown in Powai was initially feared abandoned. It turns out that its mother had dropped the young one off there for safekeeping. The cub sat there all day while its mother went out hunting, and returned to nurse it, shows footage from cameras set up to keep tabs on the cub. Over a week ago, the cub was found sitting pretty at the godown on the campus of NITIE. A wildlife team set out to ‘rescue the abandoned’ one. “But, after a distant assessment, we figured that the cub was healthy and well-tended to,” said wildlife warden Pawan Sharma. The theory of abandonment was quickly abandoned. Watch: A leopard cub that was lounging in a desolate godown in Powai was initially feared abandoned. It turns out t… https://t.co/qXGhuQvop8— TOI Mumbai (@TOIMumbai) 1619151366000A rescue team then set up cameras at the spot to keep tabs on the young spotted cat. Footage showed that its mother was visiting the cub regularly. “We were mighty relieved...” said range forest officer Santosh Kank. “The mother leopard entered the godown by clambering onto a tree abutting the Vihar lake-end of the national park. A few hours later, she was back with another cub. She left the two at the safe house.” This is in keeping with typical feline behaviour. A mother moves her litter from one place to another for safekeeping, camping at each spot for a few days, before moving on to the next. The cub was spotted by labourers working on the NITIE campus, said an official. They heard feeble roars of an animal initially mistaken for a kitten. Pictures taken from afar were sent to forest officials who confirmed it was a young leopard. A team of forest officials with volunteers from Wildlife Welfare Association, Resqink Association for Wildlife Welfare and wildlife researchers monitored the cubs who were bonding playfully with their mother, like in a natural habitat. Two days ago, she checked out of the godown with her cubs, said Sharma. “This case of wildlife taking recourse in a concrete place is unusual. Thankfully, no human intervention was needed at all.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-feared-abandoned-two-leopard-cubs-found-bonding-with-mom-in-godown/articleshow/82203992.cms||Alex Fernandes

According to the police, Anirudhsinh Zala, 52, a resident of Sidsar village in Muli taluka, Mehulsinh Masani, 30, a resident of Thoriyali village of Wadhwan taluka, and Ramji Aal, 40, a resident of Rajpara village in Wadhwan taluka, were arrested from Targhadi village on Kuvadava road. “We have seized four country-made weapons — two pistols and two ‘tamanchas’ — and six live cartridges from the accused. They came to Rajkot to sell the weapons. During the questioning, Anirudhsinh Zala, the main accused, confessed to have purchased the weapons from Balwant Singh alias Ballu from Madhya Pradesh's Munawar village,” a police official said.

---||Nagpur||Govt officials shirking from their responsibilities in pandemic: HC||Nagpur: Irked over contradictory affidavits filed by the collector and Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) joint commissioner over their failure to supply 10,000 Remdesvir as per its orders, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court censured the authorities for shirking responsibilities rather than saving the lives of Covid-19 patients who are dying in the absence of beds, essential medicines and oxygen in Vidarbha. The judges have summoned the Central Drug Controller to attend Friday's hearing to explain steps taken to ensure proper and continuous supply of Remdesvir across India. “We direct him to remain personally present, either physically or virtually, and apprise on the steps taken in exercise of his powers under the Drugs Control Act, 1950, to prevent hoarding, undue stocking and black-marketing of this drug,” the judges said. “On April 19, we had issued directives to the government to release Remdesvir vials for the city immediately. But, has been complied with only partially. Several reasons are given for non-compliance. We find that these officers have now started to shirk their responsibilities in giving succour and relief to Covid-19 patients,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Shreeram Modak said. After facing the HC’s ire in afternoon, divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar informed the judges in a hearing — held late in the evening for only the second time in Nagpur bench’s history — in the same suo motu PIL based on TOI reports, that from April 19 to 21, about 5,245 vials were distributed that amounts to half the compliance of HC directives. Kumar informed that Nagpur would receive 6,752 vials of Remdesivir drug. “As soon as they’re received, they would be fairly and equitably distributed among the government and private hospitals by the nodal agency,” he told the bench said. The FDA joint commissioner earlier informed that there are seven pharmaceutical companies actively involved in Remdesvir’s production and all, barring Ghaziabad-based Jubilant, have assured supply of specific quantities. These companies send their stock to depots located in the city from where the product is distributed all over Vidarbha region. “The FDA informed that the problem has arisen owing to shortage in Remdesvir supply by the companies. Therefore, there is also scarcity in providing it to the patients. We had an extensive hearing of this matter. However, so far no concrete solution could be found regarding deficiency in Remdesvir supply and also oxygen to Vidarbha’s Covid hospitals,” the judges said. Apart from amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar who was assisted by Sejal Lakhani, the hearing was attended by collector collector Ravindra Thakare, NMC commissioner B Radhakrishnan, Vidarbha Hospitals’ Association (VHA) Dr Anup Marar and Dr Anil Laddhad. Earlier, assistant solicitor general (ASGI) Ulhas Aurangabadkar informed that Remdesvir’s total capacity is 88 lakh vials through seven manufacturers. The expert doctors informed HC that this capacity is quite sufficient to cater to the needs of serious Covid patients in the country. They said if manufacturers are directed to streamline their supply process to all the states, there would be no shortage and eventually eliminate the malpractice of its sale in black-market. “We accept the experts’ opinion and request ASGI to obtain instructions from the drug controller to ensure Remdesvir’s fair and equal supply by all seven companies, not only to Maharashtra or Vidarbha, but to the entire nation,” they said.

---||Madurai||The king of fruits has arrived, but beware of artificial ripening||Madurai: The scent of mangoes on display at fruit shops is causing heads to turn while crossing fruit shops. The season for the king of fruits has only just begun as the supply right now is scant and will take a week or so for the harvest to gain momentum. Traders say that only limited stock is hitting the market and only natural that the price will be on the higher side. Madurai receives mangoes from various areas like Periyakulam, Cumbum and Bodinayakkanur in Theni district, Natham and its surrounding areas in Dindigul district and Alanganallur and Palamedu in Madurai district. Mangoes from Madurai are dispatched as far as Maharashtra and Gujarat until the season begins there. During peak season, Madurai fruit market handles 100-150 tonnes of mangoes daily. At present it deals only a fraction of it, say commission agents. Imam Pasand, Sappattai, Sendhuram, Ottukaai, Neelam and Kalapadi are the most sought-after mango varieties in southern districts. Traders say that Imam Pasand, which was sold at Rs 120 last year is being sold at Rs 160 right now. Sappattai and Kalapadi are being sold at Rs 120, while it was Rs 60 last year, retailers say. R Shanthanam, a commission agent from Madurai, said that with decent rain this year they expect a normal season this year. “There would not be much difference when it comes to pricing this year. Although the price is high so far, it will come down to normal price within a week or 10 days.” Food safety officials in Madurai have warned people to be cautious of mangoes ripened using banned methods. They asked consumers to wait for a few days before making purchases as mostly premature mangoes, ripened using illegal means, will hit the market in the initial days of the season. They will conduct frequent checks against illegal ripening methods in a few days, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/the-king-of-fruits-has-arrived-but-beware-of-artificial-ripening/articleshow/82203990.cms||V Devanathan

The house was locked and VB sleuths had to wait for sometime till Virdee’s wife and father-in-law reached and opened the house. Virdee was placed under suspension after a case under Prevention of Corruption Act was registered against him and others at VB police station Mohali in August last year. While Vigilance Bureau officials remained inaccessible all day, sources said the team reached Virdee’s house early in the morning but found it locked. The raid was conducted to arrest Virdee, who, officials thought, was inside, sources said. The team waited outside the house in a neighbouring plot. Later, the suspended official’s father-in-law and wife arrived and engaged in an argument with Vigilance Bureau officials, who searched the house after opening it but did not find Virdee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/vb-raids-suspended-gst-officials-residence/articleshow/82203987.cms||---
---||Goa||To reduce backlog, Goa gives samples to private lab||PANAJI: The directorate of health services on Thursday outsourced samples for Covid testing to a private lab to reduce the government’s backlog. Health secretary Ravi Dhawan said that it was decided to outsource the samples already collected to Thyrocare Labs which has the capacity of giving results within 36 hours. “We have already sent samples from the North Goa district hospital so that the pending reports are expedited,” Dhawan said. Health services director Dr Jose D’Sa said that samples from labs in Mapusa, Margao, Chicalim and Ponda which have a backlog, will be sent to ICMR approved labs that can give reports within 36 hours. “This is a measure that the government has taken to cut down the time,” he said. Goa Medical College dean and Covid hospitals in charge, Dr S Bandekar said that the government has already booked machines and a vehicle with two machines to increase testing. “The van has a capacity of testing 300 tests every six to eight hours. We are sending the van to Asilo hospital because it has a lot of backlog,” he said, adding that more steps are being taken to increase testing. Chief minister Pramod Sawant had recently appealed to the people to self-isolate after they’ve given their samples for testing and before they receive their results so that they don’t spread the infection to others. TOI had reported on Wednesday that people have been waiting for results for four to five days, while some don’t receive their results at all and their health starts deteriorating and even leads to hospitalisation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/to-reduce-backlog-state-gives-samples-to-pvt-lab/articleshow/82205155.cms||---
---||Madurai||Building a museum of everyday objects||Do you remember ironsmiths using hand-held blowers to stoke the fire or farmers using an iron pot with holes to irrigate fields? With technology making work easier and faster, the familiar tools that made each region unique are gradually losing their utlity. To hold on to that memory of how life was before the machines, the Madurai Kamaraj University will be setting up the Tamil Culture and Heritage Centre. The brain behind the centre, with a collection of more than 200 items of daily use that are now considered artefacts, B Sathiyamoorthi, head of the department of Tamilology, School of Tamil Studies, says, "The aim of the centre is to create awareness about things that were used by the Tamil community, life and occupation." As agriculture was the main occupation in the state, Sathiyamoorthi first got his hands on wooden ploughs, known as ‘kalapai’, followed by a couple of ‘salpanais’ huge vessels with a capacity to store more than 50 litres. "These vessels, made of iron sheets moulded to form a vessel with its bottom fitted with leather that stretched when water was filled in it, were used to draw water from wells for irrigation. They were fitted to pulleys, which in turn were operated by bullocks," says Sathiyamoorthy who identified these tools with the help of his father Ramasamy Bose, a farmer. The granaries of yore used mud vessels, known as ‘kulumais’ and were of different shapes and sizes depending on the type of paddy stored. While some of these items like bullock carts and wooden ploughs are still used by small farmers in remote villages, finding items like leather blowers or ‘tholthurukki’ used by iron smithies was a challenge. "I made 250 trips to different villages till I found a pair in a village near Senthurai in Dindigul district, but the ironsmiths were not willing to part with the blowers which had been in their family for seven generations,’’ said Sathiyamoorthy. Since fishing was another occupation or hobby, some of the less-used tools like bamboo basket ‘ootha’ to catch fish in summer from shallow waters or the ‘pathakattai’, a wooden plank with small holes installed in a flowing river to catch small fish like the ‘ayirai’ was collected to be displayed at the centre. Tools like the potters’ wheel which have undergone many changes over time from the wooden wheel to stone, cement wheel and now power-operated wheel have also been collected to show their evolution over time. "It is important for the future generation to know how we were an environment-friendly community,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/building-a-museum-of-everyday-objects/articleshow/82203997.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Deserted roads of Prayagraj, a witness to Covid-19’s devastating second wave||Prayagraj: Sangam city is presently struggling on two fronts. On one hand are the roads of busy markets and colonies which are witnessing a lull of gloomy silence due to the second wave of Covid-19 and on the other hand are the cremation ghats which are buzzing with hectic activities round the clock. The count of bodies for cremation only keeps going up with every passing day, something which the locals claim they had never seen before. The traffic on various roads of Sangam City had always been fairly smooth-flowing because of the broad roads and dividers at almost all the important roads of the city. However, there were several crossings and roads which witnessed a heavy flow of traffic including Mahatma Gandhi road, Stanley road, Motilal Nehru Road, Balson crossing, Lok Seva Aayog crossing, Dhobi Ghat crossing etc. But, for the last one week or so there has been a drastic fall in the number of vehicles and commuters coming out on the road. According to traffic police sources, the roads which witnessed an average of around 40-50 vehicles in a minute are today witnessing just around 10 vehicles per minute. TOI too visited some of the important crossings and locations of the city to witness the fall in the number of people on the roads. The roads indeed wore a deserted look due to the Covid fear that has gripped the city. The busy crossing of Meerapur, an important intersection of moving towards SS Khanna Girls Degree College, Kareli, Meerapur, Atarsuiya, Rani Mandi and Chowk was otherwise considered the busiest area of the city but nowadays it hardly sees any traffic congestion as only a few vehicles are coming out on the road. Another location of Civil Lines, which witnessed hectic activities throughout the day is today almost deserted. Coffee House which was one place in the city where one could see people sitting in large numbers and discussing socio-political issues is today witnessing thin attendance. Likewise, the entire parking area for the long MG road is witnessing hardly any traffic. People are surprised to see just around 10 per cent of vehicles in the parking area. The Noorullaha road of the old city area, which was otherwise full of people and commuters and roadside vendors especially during the ongoing holy month of Ramzan, is today deserted. Although few people are coming out on the roads to buy the essentials, more or less there is hardly any traffic for roadside vendors in this area. According to the traffic police department, the traffic load at MG road has reduced by 50- 60 per cent, at Roshanbagh it has reduced around 50 per cent, at Talierganj around 70 per cent, at Meerapur around 55-60 per cent and at Johnstonganj (one of the busiest intersection of the city) the traffic load has come down to around 55 per cent. “I am now 94 years old and living in the city for the past 65 years but I have never witnessed anything like this before. People are frightened to come out on the roads and rightly so. This sense of gloom, combined with the threat of getting infected is what will protect them. But still, the silence on the roads and the pal of gloom in every locality is something that I had not wished to see or remember” said LK Dikshit, an elderly of Mahenduari locality of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/deserted-roads-of-prayagraj-a-witness-to-covid-19s-devastating-second-wave/articleshow/82204120.cms||---
---||Varanasi||“We will remember this unbearable pain for our entire life”||Prayagraj: The banks of river Ganga and Yamuna, which were echoing with the chimes of aarti and clapping of devotees till last month, are now dominated by the pall of gloom and smoke of the woods of the pyre at the cremation ghats. At the two-prominent cremation ghats of the city, including Rasoolabad ghat and Daraganj located at the banks of Ganga, there are queues of relatives and ambulances that reach the ghats throughout the day. The waiting starts at the wee hours of each day and the cremation starts around 7am and goes till 8 or 9 in the night. The pyres are lighted one after the other as far as space beside the river allows. “This ghat used to receive around 15-20 bodies each day but, today we are receiving around 70 to 80 bodies. The entire road leading, to the ghat is jammed with vehicles and parked ambulances. People are coming to the ghat not only from the city but from the other neighbouring districts as well,” said Abhimanyu Tripathi whose family has been cremating the dead for several generations at Rasoolabad ghat. The situation is no different at Daraganj ghat. Chandan Mishra, one of the priests conducting the last rites at the ghat, said, “It is an unbearable pain and we all will remember this for our entire life. Bodies of young, ageing 25-30 years old are also there, along with the elderly who are falling prey to the virus.” At Karelaghat and the ghat located at Phaphamau side of river Ganga, the situation is more or less the same. The priests and those performing the last rites are receiving many more bodies as they were receiving in normal days. The scene at the graveyard, used for burying the bodies of the Muslim community, is no different. The present coronavirus has resulted into record number of deaths in Muslim community too. The pain and agony of those performing the last rites and among those driving the vehicle for bringing the bodies at the cremation ghats is no less than those who have lost their family members. Raju, driver of one of the vehicles of Nagar Nigam, says he is not been able to concentrate on the nine days of Puja at his house. He is not able to sleep and often dream of the cremation ghats and pray to god that the crisis gets over soon. Likewise, Mohammed Moin, who drives a bus for bringing bodies from the neighbouring Pratapgarh district also prays to almighty that things get normal in the coming days. He is in the business of bringing bodies for several years. Inspite of keeping Roza, he is not letting the fast come in his duty for being human. Situation is so grim that there is shortage of vehicles for transporting the bodies to the cremation ghats. Till last month, around 45 buses, in the neighbouring Pratapgarh district which were used to bring the dead bodies to Prayagraj, were without business but nowadays same buses ply twice a day to bring the dead bodies. The bus owners have not increased the fair for bringing the bodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/we-will-remember-this-unbearable-pain-for-our-entire-life/articleshow/82204106.cms||---

District magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said there will be a stressful situation of oxygen availability for the next two days and appealed to hospitals to admit patients only as per their allotted oxygen quota and refer the rest to higher centres. Sharma and MLC AK Sharma met BHU officials and asked them to increase 40 beds for Covid patients. BHU has been given 15 more ventilators. As the number of patients in adjoining districts has also started increasing, they have also started procuring oxygen from Chandauli. Divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said the number of beds with oxygen facility has increased to 650, while ventilators and beds with high flow nasal cannula had been increased to 400 in Varanasi till Thursday night. “The process to set up an oxygen plant in DDU district hospital has started and it will be ready by May 5. The demand for additional manpower, including doctors and paramedics, is also being fulfilled,” Agarwal added. Two more RNA extraction machines would be installed and become operational in 10 days and will reduce the time of Covid tests, he added. He said BHU has been asked to outsource staff for lab operations and the Kashi Vishwanath temple would give funds to pay them. The 1,000 bed Covid-19 facility being set up by DRDO in German Hangars at BHU stadium will also be completed in the next 10 days. All these additional arrangements will be in place in the next 10 days after which there will be some respite, the commissioner added. Meanwhile, officials are appealing to people to consult doctors soon on noticing Covid symptoms and take medicines so that severity and complications are avoided and they can get cured at home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/scarcity-of-beds-oxygen-inkashi-to-be-over-in-10-days/articleshow/82203999.cms||---

With active Covid cases rising above 6,000 and with only three private oxygen plants, the district administration had been working hard to strike a balance between the steep increase in the demand from government and private hospitals and supply. DM Andra Vamsi has deployed police force at all the oxygen units and has assigned to the SDM and City Magistrate the responsibility of ensuring judicious distribution of oxygen to government hospitals and private nursing homes as per their specific needs. Talking to TOI, Dr R R Singh, president, Private Nursing Homes’ Association, said, “There has been a huge surge in oxygen demand because all government and private hospitals are full as we are getting Covid patients from all parts of Bundelkhand. Under such circumstances, streamlining the supply is a challenging job and we all are on our toes. I am thankful to the district administration and the manufacturers who are working round the clock for ensuring smooth supply”. Singh said his hospital received supply at 2.30am. “Till now there has been no shortage of oxygen in any private hospital, though the situation is alarming because of the growing number of patients,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/new-oxygen-plant-to-come-up-in-jhansi-dm/articleshow/82204064.cms||---

Soon after receiving the result, a Covid-positive patient will immediately shift to the nearest Covid facility or hospital. So far, the text message facility was available only within the limits of Aurangabad city.ZP CEO Mangesh Gondawle told TOI: “We have decided to implement the auto-messaging system enabling people who underwent tests to instantly receive the reports through text messages on their registered cellphone numbers.” He added the implementation should be completed in another two days.He said instructions have already been issued for putting home-quarantine stamps on the people undergoing tests and awaiting reports.As per the SOP followed in Aurangabad rural, all samples taken at about 100 centres, are collected and sent every day at 5 pm. The samples collected after 5 pm, are sent the next day.As on date, all the samples collected from across rural Aurangabad are being tested at Paul Hebert Centre for DNA Barcoding and Biodiversity Studies at the Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University. Though the centre, which has two testing machines, has a capacity to test 2,000 samples in 24 hours, the authorities, with the help of technical staff, have optimized their use and are testing 2,500-3,000 samples in 24 hours.All the collected samples reach the testing facility between 9 pm and 10 pm and testing on these samples is completed in about 24 hours before the results are sent to the centres concerned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/patients-in-aurangabad-rural-to-get-test-reports-via-text-message/articleshow/82201716.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The family rushed the octogenarian, a Noida resident, to Sharda Hospital, a designated Covid facility, in Knowledge Park III after finding an ambulance. “We got confirmation from the Gautam Budh Nagar administration and official sources of a bed at Sharda hospital. The information was also passed on to the integrated control room in Noida, facilitating admission. Since he was a Noida resident, we thought it will not be difficult to access health services in Noida,” a close aide of Maliwal said. However, on reaching the hospital, the family alleged they were made to wait outside for over an hour during which Swaroop collapsed. Maliwal later tweeted, “My nana died waiting for emergency support in front of Sharda Hospital Greater Noida. I kept standing there for half hour and pleading for admission and nothing happened. Shame! Pathetic!” The DCW chief told TOI, “My grandparents live in Noida and since my grandfather was down with Covid, I spoke to someone at a Noida hospital where I was promised a bed too. We couldn't even find an ambulance initially. However, when we reached the hospital, I was made to run around for an hour after which they denied giving us a bed. By that time, his condition was deteriorating and we eventually lost him.” The hospital told TOI it did not have a ventilator or ICU bed that it could allot to Swaroop immediately. Ajeet Kumar, spokesperson for Sharda hospital, said, “We kept trying to arrange for a bed for Janardhan ji when he reached our hospital. Since we were not informed about his need and condition in advance, we could not offer a ventilator or ICU bed to him on an immediate basis. We have a lot of critical patients. Ventilator beds and ICU wards are packed to capacity.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/maliwals-grandad-dies-waiting-for-a-bed/articleshow/82204021.cms||---

According to the ragpickers and scrap traders, their daily collection of articles has dropped by almost 80%.Vijaya Kamble, a 30-year-old ragpicker, said she used to earn about Rs 150 each day by picking scrap and rags from different areas in the city and selling them by the evening. With the current restrictions, she said she is able to make only about Rs 30-40 a day, making it almost impossible for her to sustain her family.The city has about 3000 woman ragpickers of all ages and they are all struggling. They said they are neither on the politicians’ nor on the administration’s priority list.The other reason contributing to the fall in income is the restrictions on all businesses (except emergency services). The restrictions have led to a drop in the volume waste — polythene, paper boxes, glass and used bottles, plastic, metal scrap and other articles.Anita Bhalerao said the scrap traders are not part of the emergency service category. “I and many like me live on money made through ragpicking. Some scrap traders have been generous and they have been purchasing the collected scrap and paying us the standard rate,” she said.The ragpickers maintained that irrespective of the amount of scrap collected during these four hours, they have to rush to the scrap trader, before the shop closes for the day at 11 am. “Failing to reach the scrap shop on time means we will have to go hungry for the day,” said Lata Belsure.Scrap trader Shaikh Ismail, who has a godown in the Naregaon area, said, “Hundreds of families sustain themselves on ragpicking . If we stop purchasing from them, things will become extremely difficult for them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/covid-related-daily-time-restrictions-put-strain-on-ragpickers-income-in-aurangabad/articleshow/82201730.cms||Mohammed Akhef

At 37 degrees celsius, the maximum temperature in the city was below normal by two units, as per the data with the India Meteorological Department (IMD).While partly cloudy conditions are likely to stay for at least a few days, the Met department has issued a forecast of unseasonal or thunderstorm in the middle of next week. Weather expert Kirankumar Johare said the low-pressure areas formed over parts of the state, including Aurangabad, were resulting in overcast conditions. “The weather systems over Bay of Bengal or the Arabian Sea are normal at present. The formation of low-pressure areas can be attributed to local phenomena generating due to the instability in atmospheric conditions,” he said. Among other Marathwada cities, Nanded recorded a maximum temperature of 39 degree celsius, which was below normal by two units, whereas the mercury level in Parbhani was also below normal by one unit, hovering at 40 degree celsius. While the drop in the temperature level can offer some relief to citizens amid summer, it is likely to harm mangoes which are at the ripening stage. “The summer heat is essential for natural ripening of mangoes, before harvesting the fruits. While the recent instances of unseasonal showers and gusty winds have led to mangoes falling off trees, the current weather changes may further affect the overall yield as per desired quality,” said Kishor Lande, a farmer from Beed district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/partly-cloudy-sky-brings-down-temperature-in-aurangabad/articleshow/82201733.cms||---

An official said there should be some guidelines on how to cover all the age groups at one time “A phased-out programme will be easy for us, rather than to try cover all categories at a go,” said a health officials managing the vaccination programme.With a population of around 12.8 crore, Maharashtra till Wednesday has vaccinated 1.33 crore people. As many as 15.88 lakh people have so far got their second doses. With 6 % of its population aged over 18 years, Maharashtra has a target to immunise 8.5 crore people in the third phase of the vaccination drivefrom May 1. For this, the state needs 17 crore doses.Pune Platform for Covid response member Pradeep Bhargava said the vaccination programme has to be opened up sequentially, first for the people aged between 30 years and 45 years and then those in the 18-30 year category.“The state can decide on the phasing out of the programme as per the capacity to vaccinate and ability to organise the doses. One has to keep in mind the limited stock of vaccines,” Bhargava said. Resident Arun Nair said, “I was at a hospital in Yerawada at 1pm and the vaccination started around 3.30pm.” Health activist Ravindra Sinha said the state should consider prioritising the vaccination drive in hotspots, housing societies and for people with comorbidities and those in the essential work category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-favour-sequential-inoculation-from-may-1-to-tide-over-vax-shortage/articleshow/82204042.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Panchayat polls were held there on April 19. Umesh Mishra, Amroha district magistrate, said, “The repoll will be held at Burawali for village head’s post and for block development council (BDC) member’s post at Baikheda.” According to officials, Burawali was witness to violence when a group snatched some ballot papers and fled. More than 50 villagers were booked for allegedly creating ruckus and snatching ballot papers. Some seven people were detained in this connection. At Baikheda, the name of one candidate for BDC’s post was missing from the ballot paper, the officials said.

---||Nagpur||Cases, recoveries and deaths in Vidarbha constant for last 5 days||Nagpur: On Thursday, Vidarbha reported 15,597 new cases, 13,352 recoveries and 265 deaths. While cases and recoveries increased as compared to Wednesday, there were fewer deaths. In the last five days, the average daily cases, recoveries and deaths have been almost constant, which is an indicator that the curve of Vidarbha’s Covid-19 cases is moving towards plateau. The number of tests in the 11 districts of Vidarbha has been more or less around 60,000 per day for the last three days. Number of new cases is still under 16,000 while the number of recoveries is increasing slowly but steadily for the last six days. Increasing recoveries and constant number of new cases can be an indicator of the wave reaching its peak. Now the graph can be expected to gradually move towards a plateau. Deaths, however, are still a major concern. Of the total deaths reported on Thursday, 110 were from Nagpur district alone. These include 58 from Nagpur city and 45 from Nagpur rural, which means cases are incresing in the rural parts. Nine out of 11 districts reported more than 10 deaths on Thursday, with Yavatmal registering 37 deaths, which is highest after Nagpur. Yavatmal is the only district after Nagpur to report more than 1,000 deaths due to Covid-19. This is when the population of entire Yavatmal district is less than the Nagpur city alone. Chandrapur reported 28 deaths, Gadchiroli 19, Wardha 16, and Gondia 11. With this, cumulative toll of Nagpur division has nearly doubled than that of Amravati division. The number of under-treatment patients is still high. On Thursday, 1,42,407 patients were under-treatment in Vidarbha. TOI has reported earlier that at this pace, the number may increase up to 2 lakh by May 1. Increased number of under-treatment patients is adding into the crisis of beds, oxygen and medicines in Vidarbha. Chandrapur: Yet another sharp rise of 1537 cases was recorded, while 28 patients succumbed on Thursday. There were 922 recoveries during the day, which left 13,760 patients under treatment. The toll has reached to 699. The caseload has mounted to 47,983, while recoveries reached 33,524. Amravati: The day saw 16 Covid deaths for the second time this month, taking the district’s toll to 829 while a spike of 739 cases took the caseload to 59,124. With 470 recoveries, the total reached 52,153. Now, 6,142 patients are under treatment. Yavatmal: Of the 6,733 reports received on Thursday, 1,220 came positive. There were 1,112 recoveries and 37 deaths, including one from outside Yavatmal. Wardha: The district recorded 16 deaths, 755 new cases and 424 recoveries on Thursday. The caseload increased to 28,993, recoveries 23,506 while 4,871 patients are under treatment. According to district administration, five deaths had occurred on April 15. The toll reached 616. Bhandara: Out of the 1,816 tests done in the last 24 hours, 949 came positive, which means the sample positivity rate is about more than 50%. Bhandara’s caseload has reached 41,461. On the other hand, 1,568 patients were discharged, taking the recoveries to 29,365. With 14 deaths in last 24 hours, the total toll has reached 642. Now, 11,454 patients are under treatment. Gondia: The district reported 11 deaths, 662 new cases and 581 recoveries. Gondia has so far seen 412 deaths, 28,375 cases, 21,237 recoveries. Now, 6,726 patients are under treatment. Gadchiroli: The toll reached 280 after death of 19 patients on Thursday. With 417 new cases on Thursday, total reached 16,936. The district has 3883 patients under treatment. Washim: The district reported 387 new cases, 296 recoveries and a death on Thursday. With total cases reaching 23,758, Washim now has 4,045 patients under treatment. Buldhana: Out of 5,840 tests done in 24 hours, Buldhana reported 879 new cases, while 1,184 patients recovered. Three deaths were reported. Now, with 356 deaths and 55,700 cases, Buldhana has 48,298 recoveries and 7,046 patients under treatment. Akola: The district reported 10 deaths on Thursday, taking toll to 602. Cases also increased despite of fewer tests. Akola reported 708 new cases out of 3,976 tests. Only 127 patients recovered. Now, out of 36,145 cases, 29,373 have recovered. Now, 6,170 patients are under treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cases-recoveries-and-deaths-in-vidarbha-constant-for-last-5-days/articleshow/82204081.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Pune||Men account for 53% of 19L beneficiaries in district till April 21, says gender report||Pune: A gender vaccination report released by the district health office (DHO) revealed that of 19 lakh vaccine beneficiaries, inoculated till April 21 in Pune district, around 10 lakhs, or 53%, are men, while 9 lakh beneficiaries are women. Around 199 persons, who identify as ‘others’, have also been inoculated in the district. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI that the vaccination has received a good response from both genders. In the early part of the vaccination drive, when healthcare workers and frontline workers were vaccinated, the participation of men was comparatively higher. The number improved when vaccination for general citizens started from March 1. Meanwhile, Pune district received around 50,000 Covishield doses on Thursday from the state government. According to the health department officials, the doses are good to hold vaccination until Saturday. Had fresh stock not arrived on Thursday, the response would have been affected on Friday, Deshmukh said. Most of the available stock was exhausted on Thursday, when the district recorded vaccination of a little over 50,000 beneficiaries, he added. With the fresh stock, Pune rural now has 36,207 Covishield doses available, while Pune Municipal Corporation(PMC) has only 9,091 doses of Covishield remaining. The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has 7,230 doses of Covishield available as of Thursday evening. The DHO report on Thursday stated that as many as 50,030 people were vaccinated, including citizens aged above 45 years, healthcare and frontline workers in Pune district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/men-account-for-53-of-19l-beneficiaries-in-district-till-april-21-says-gender-report/articleshow/82204068.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The traders from other states are also hesitant to place orders here due to the increasing number of Covid cases in Maharashtra.Satish Koshti, the president of the district power loom association, said that Ichalkarani has a large number of migrant workers working in around 13,000 small and big power loom factories. “The textile industry here was recovering after the huge set back last year. But the fear of lockdown and rise in Covid cases is driving migrant workers back. The industries, which stay largely dependent on migrant workers, have been badly affected again,” he said.The strict lockdown last year and reduction in orders had severely hit the textile hub. Currently, only the looms with export orders are functioning up to 50%, while the domestic supply is stopped.Ashutosh Hupare, a textile loom owner, said, “If the migrant workers leave they won’t return soon and without them, the mills can’t function. So I have decided to provide food and shelter along with some advance payment to the migrant workers in my factory. But still few are insisting on returning home in fear of lockdown.”Harsh Shah, a textile trader said, “With the yarn cost fluctuating, the owners are hesitant to place an order as after purchase if the yarn cost goes further down it will be difficult to recover the amount.” He added that due to this the dealers from other textile producing cities like Surat, Mumbai, Bhiwandi, Delhi, Meerut and Kanpur are not placing any new orders. A few of them have cancelled their orders due to rise in Covid cases.Last year’s traumatic experience still haunts the workers. Maan Singh, a migrant worker said, “Last year, we faced several difficulties to reach our home towns and hence we are returning to avoid the same. The market is slow and the Covid cases are continuously rising. So, it is better for us to return home and stay with our families.Ichalkaranji is famous for its grey cloth production after which the unprocessed cloth is sent to Surat, Mumbai, Bhiwandi and Delhi for further processing. The city with the presence of powerloom, air-jet, knitting and handloom also exports fabric across the world.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/textile-mills-in-ichalkarani-go-silent-as-workers-leave/articleshow/82201753.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

On Wednesday night, Vastrapur police stopped Krishna Bariya, 27, a resident of Shahpur. When he told cops that he had gone to play cricket in Sanand and got late, the cops arrested him under Section 188 of the IPC for disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant. Gujarat government has announced night curfew from 8pm to 6am in 20 cities from April 7 till April 30 amid a surge in Covid-19 cases. In another incident, Ajay Bhavsar, 42, when stopped by the Vastrapur police stated that he had gone to deliver tiffin to his workers at Shivranjani and there was delay in making tiffins as a result he got delayed. In the third incident, Durgesh Joshi, 25, was caught while moving during curfew hours. When asked, he said that he had come for the night walk. A case was registered against him. In the fourth incident, a case was registered against three youths, about 22 years of age. The trio was stopped in a car on SG Highway by Vastrapur police. Two youths — Vidit Jinduwadia, a resident of Vejalpur, and Harshil Chawda, a resident of Manav Mandir, told the police that they had come to meet their friend Rishi Patel who was the third person in the car. Rishi is a resident of Bodakdev area. In two other incidents, the accused against whom complaint were filed stated that they got delayed while working in their offices. One Swagat Das, 21, a resident of Naranpura, stated that he got delayed while working at his office on SG Highway and in another incident Vinay Solanki, 21, informed the cops that he too got late at his office situated in Prahladnagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cricket-tiffin-walk-excuses-galore-during-night-curfew/articleshow/82204071.cms||---

After contracting the infection recently, Govind was initially taking treatment at Parli in Beed district but was later shifted to Latur after his health deteriorated. A day before his untimely death, Pankaja, in a social media post on Wednesday, requested her followers to pray for Govind’s recovery after doctors declared him critical. “I got a call today morning. I hoped that some miracle must have happened and Govind has regained his consciousness. However, I already came to know on June 3 (2014) that such miracles never happen,” she said recalling untimely demise of her father and BJP leader Gopinath Munde. Recalling her 14-year association with Govind, Pankaja said she always felt safe and secure in public due to him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/pankaja-mourns-covid-death-of-40-yr-old-body-guard/articleshow/82201740.cms||---
---||Delhi||Saving lives to last rites, Delhi cops take care of all||NEW DELHI: When Sonu Kumar died of Covid-19, his family members, even his mother and wife, deserted him fearing infection. But assistant sub-inspector Sushil Sharma made sure that all protocols were followed and he was cremated properly. Sharma, who is posted at Gokulpuri police station of northeast Delhi, had gone to attend to a PCR call when he found Kumar lying dead at home. “His family members, including mother and wife, were present but no one was ready to touch the body in fear of coronavirus,” said DCP Sanjay Sain. Sharma went to GTB Hospital, arranged a private ambulance and shifted the body to Dr Hedgewar Arogya Hospital around 5.20am. After the autopsy, he took the body to a crematorium in Ashok Nagar where the last rites were performed. In north Delhi, Covid patients Gurudutt Bhola (67), his wife Gauri (57) and son Karan (25) called up the station house officer of Mukherjee Nagar police station as the last resort when they were gasping for breath at home on Wednesday night. The cops rushed to a Mayapuri plant and got the family three cylinders on that very night. Senior citizen Neena Sinha at Dwarka Sector 9 also urgently needed a cylinder as her husband’s oxygen saturation fell to a critical level. The beat officer went to her home, collected an empty cylinder, got it refilled in Mundka and delivered it to her flat at 1am. Earlier, nobody in the neighbourhood could help her. The cops also procured Fabiflu strips for a patient late at night. Another senior citizen, Gurmeet Singh (66) from Kohay Enclave, was sinking when two beat cops arranged a cylinder. In North West district, sub-inspector Naveen & head constable Vijay managed to get oxygen for a patient in Tri Nagar. Around 1,500 of its own personnel have been infected and Delhi Police has set up three Covid Care Centres for them and their infected family members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/saving-lives-to-last-rites-cops-take-care-of-all/articleshow/82204090.cms||---
---||Pune||No walk-in registration for 18-45 category: Centre||Pune: Registrations for the next phase of the Covid vaccination programme — for those above 18 — will open from April 28, the government said via its Twitter handle, @MyGovIndia, on Thursday. Appointments will start from May 1. The tweet added there will be no walk-in registration for this beneficiary group. Besides CoWIN, registration via Aarogya Setu app will also start from April 28. Senior government officials said the CoWIN system is being revamped ahead of the expanded coverage. “In two days (by April 24), our software will be ready for the third phase,” Ram Sewak Sharma, chairman of the empowered group on vaccine administration, told TOI on Thursday. CoWIN will have to be revamped as the government will allow private hospitals and state governments to directly procure vaccines from manufacturers. Officials said while states can plan their own sessions, the vaccination certificates will continue to be issued by the Centre. Data shows more than 60,500 private vaccination sites have been integrated with CoWIN. Upgrades to the system will allow more hospitals to be included to ensure better and faster access to vaccines, officials said. As for back end changes, officials said the app would switch the age of registration from 45 to 18, but a major task will be integrating CoWIN APIs (application programming interface, which allows two programmes to communicate) with the hospitals. Senior government officials said it would be left to hospitals to decide whether to use the CoWIN app for registration or have a separate process as the aim is to ensure vaccine recipients are on a central database. State health officials said they may also have hospitals, who do not wish to integrate with the regular CoWIN registration process, use these APIs. Central officials said they are confident the upgraded CoWIN will be able to handle load. On Wednesday, 10,57,349 people registered for jabs on the application. Once upgrades are complete, prices of Covid vaccines will also be available on the mobile application, along with the slots. The app also provides the option of taking the second dose in a different state or city, if a person is travelling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-walk-in-registration-for-18-45-category-centre/articleshow/82204086.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Aurangabad||Test report delays blamed for Covid spread in rural Aurangabad||Aurangabad: The delay in getting the test reports of suspected Covid patients is being suspected as one of the crucial reasons for the fast spread of Covid-19 in rural areas of Aurangabad district. Local residents claim that they are getting reports two to three days after undergoing the tests, and during this period, the asymptomatic patients are freely moving around and working in farms. In the process, they are infecting people they come in contact with. The issue came to fore after the number of cases being reported from the rural areas started surpassing the number of cases being reported from Aurangabad city. Officials confided that though the issue has been there for a long time, it came to notice only after the daily Covid-count started rising. On checking with the rural authorities, it was found that in the rural areas, all the RT-PCR samples collected till 5 pm are dispatched to the Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University-based lab in the Aurangabad city. The authorities acknowledge that all the samples reach the lab sometime between 9 pm and 10 pm, following which testing process starts. Every day, 2,500-3,000 samples are tested on the two testing machines, including a manual one, with total capacity to test 2,000 samples in 24 hours. When contacted, Zilla Parishad CEO Mangesh Gondawle said, “The turnaround time of receiving a sample and dispatching the result is less than 24 hours. For the samples received by 9 pm on any given day, the results are sent out by 9 pm the next day.” Confirming the issue about people (whose test reports are awaited) moving around in villages and rural areas and inadvertently becoming super-spreaders, Gondawle said, “We have taken note of this issue and have now asked the health workers to ensure that people whose samples have been collected should be stamped for home quarantine.” Medical sources said the test reports are often received at night. If a person, who has tested positive, is at his/her home or a far-off location, it becomes difficult to contact him/her. The person get to know of the result only on the next day, which is the third day from the day of testing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/test-report-delays-blamed-for-covid-spread-in-rural-aurangabad/articleshow/82201751.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Pranav Raol, a 42-year-old resident of Gurukul who owns the shop in Shali Complex, told police that the incident occurred around 6pm on Tuesday evening.  “Three youths aged about 25 to 30 years were standing outside the showroom, abusing each other. My employee Yatish Thakar went out to check what was happening when the three men turned on him. They asked him why he was watching them and began abusing him,” said Pranav, who intervened and tried to calm the youths. He took Yatish back into the showroom but the youths barged in and began abusing the staff. The three allegedly told Raol that they were associated with some Mahesh Desai and threatened him of dire consequences. They also allegedly threatened that they would force him to wind down his business from the area. Raol said that he immediately called the control room following which the three youths ran out of the showroom. The Vastrapur police have registered a case and are now scanning the CCTV footage to get details of the three unidentified men.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/three-men-ransack-sari-showroom/articleshow/82204087.cms||---
---||Pune||Dist has over 52L people in 18-plus bracket: Voter data||Pune: Electoral data has shown that 52.1 lakh citizens in Pune district will become eligible for Covid-19 vaccination when the drive starts for 18 and 45 age category from May 1.The data spans the district’s 21 assembly constituencies. The highest number of beneficiaries are in the 30 to 39 age bracket — an estimated 20.3 lakh people. Chinchwad, with 3.9 lakh people in this age bracket, has the highest number of eligible citizens; Hadapsar in Pune city follows with 3.7 lakh people. The Kasba Peth constituency has the lowest number of beneficiaries — 1.6 lakh citizens.Experts said the voter data could be used to plan the vaccination programmes. Deputy district electoral officer, Mrunalini Nimbalkar, said the data is based on the updated electoral list. “It can help our local administrations,” she told TOI on Thursday.The 18-19 age bracket has a little less than one lakh eligible beneficiaries in the district. Among the 21 constituencies, Chinchwad has the most number of citizens in the 30-39 age bracket, with 1.7 lakh people. Kasba Peth has the lowest number in this group (60,114).The Shivajinagar constituency has the lowest number of beneficiaries in the 18 to 19 group, with just 1,731 enrolled citizens.Electoral data has been used by local administrations for targeted vaccine drives. When Covid inoculations started for those above 45, Pune zilla parishad, for instance, used its electoral list to reach out to beneficiaries directly. ASHAs contacted eligible citizens in every taluka to ensure they had been covered. Ayush Prasad, the CEO of the zilla parishad, said, “The electoral list gave us a clear idea of eligibility and location of citizens. We have been able to use this method very effectively. Our ASHAs are working round-the-clock to reach out to those who’re eligible.”In January this year the Election Commission said it would extend “full assistance” to the government in identifying targeted beneficiaries at the polling station level for the Covid-19 vaccination drive. It had one condition: that this voter data be deleted once the vaccination programme is over.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dist-has-over-52l-people-in-18-plus-bracket-voter-data/articleshow/82204073.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Nagpur||Chandrapur patients suffer for want of correct bed info||Chandrapur: At a time when Covid-19 patients are dying for want of treatment and availability of beds, misleading information given through different administrative sources over beds is adding to confusion among the patients and their relatives. Officials sources like administration website, press communiqué and the information given by the Covid helpline centre about availability of beds make contradictory claims. The official communiqué signed by the district health officer claims that there are 1,371 beds in government and private dedicated Covid hospitals (DCH - 939 beds) and dedicated Covid health centres (DCHC - 432 beds). In reality, none of these facilities currently has beds for serious patients. The press communicque shows the availability of 136 beds at DCHC and 228 beds at DCH on Thursday evening. However, there is no differentiation of general beds, oxygen beds, ICU and ventilator beds mentioned in the press release. The official website of the administration district, Chanda.nic.in, shows that there are 1,253 beds in DCHC and DCH hospitals under government and private players. They include 357 general beds, 706 oxygen beds, 190 ICU beds and 88 ventilator beds. Presently, it shows the availability of 53 vacant beds, 48 of them general beds, 4 ICU beds and one oxygen beds. However, those at helpline desk claim that there are no oxygen or ICU beds available in district. At the Covid facility at women’s hospital, the press communiqué says there are 296 beds and all of them vacant. However, as per the helpline there are just 51 beds operational at the hospital which include 12 general, 18 oxygen and 21 ICU. All of them have been occupied, as per the helpline. There is no mention of Covid facility at women’s hospital on the administration’s website. An affidavit filed by district collector Ajay Gulhane with the high court in reply to a PIL filed by political leader Naresh Puglia over lack of Covid facility in Chandrapur, has claimed that 450 beds have been made available at the women’s hospital and as on date (on January 12, 2021, when the affidavit was filed) 132 beds, including 62 ICU and 70 oxygen beds, are available here.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/chandrapur-patients-suffer-for-want-of-correct-bed-info/articleshow/82204100.cms||---

NMC standing committee chairman Ganesh Gite has decided to form a committee of corporators to ensure that auditors are working in all the private hospitals and patients are not overcharged.As per state government guidelines, it is mandatory for the private Covid hospitals to bill Covid patients as per the government-fixed rates. The private hospitals must also have boards displaying the rates for Covid treatment. NMC had appointed auditors at almost all the private hospitals. The auditors have been entrusted with the responsibility of checking the bills and preventing overcharging. The private hospitals must mandatorily get the bills checked and approved by the NMC-appointed auditors.But according to the corporators, some auditors are not doing their duties and are often not at the assigned hospital. The issue came up for discussion during the standing committee meeting on Wednesday.“At private Covid hospitals, the bills have to be checked by the NMC-appointed auditors. But some auditors are not going to the private hospitals assigned to them. As a result, some private hospitals are looting the Covid patients,” said Salim Shaikh, a standing committee member. Other panel members also reiterated the same. Gite said a committee of few corporators will be formed to ensure that auditors are seriously doing their jobs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-corporators-unhappy-with-auditors-at-pvt-hospitals/articleshow/82201776.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Covid claims Bollywood composer Shravan Rathod||From Husnlal-Bhagatram to Shankar-Jaikishan, from Kalyanji-Anandji to Laxmikant Pyarelal, Hindi film industry has a rich tradition of musical partnerships. Nadeem-Shravan forged an illustrious link to this abiding chain composing a staggering bunch of chartbusters in the 1990s. On Thursday evening, the alliance was snapped forever as Covid-19 claimed the life of Shravan Rathod at a Mumbai hospital. He was 66. Speaking to Bombay Times, Nadeem said, “My Shanu is no more. We have seen an entire life together. We saw our highs, we saw our lows. We’ve grown up with each other in many ways. We never lost touch and no physical distance could ever separate the two of us. I am in deep pain as I say this but my friend and my companion, my partner of so many years is no more. It has left such a vacuum.” The pair started off with ‘Dangal’ (1977), the first Bhojpuri film made in colour. ‘Kashi hile Patna hile’, a reworked version of the popular folk track, ‘Aarah hile Chhapra hile’, became a sensation. The two graduated to Hindi cinema in the 1980s. Tuneful melodies for films such as ‘Maine Jeena Seekh Liya Hai’ (1982) got them work but major success eluded them. The duo hit the jackpot with Mahesh Bhatt-directed ‘Aashiqui’ (1990). Every song in this intense romantic drama, from ‘Dheere dheere se meri zindagi mein ana’ to ‘Bas ik sanam chahiye’—rose to the charts. The film also vaulted Kumar Sanu, who sang a majority of the tracks, to the top. Nadeem-Shravan became a hot property. The 1990s belonged to them. ‘Saajan’, ‘Deewana’, ‘Dil Hai ke Manta Nahi’, ‘Phool aur Kaante’, ‘Hum Hain Rahi Pyar Ke’, ‘Raja Hindustani’ and ‘Pardes’—they lorded over the decade blending old school melody with modern instrumentation. Songs such as ‘Mera dil bhi kitna pagal hai’ (Saajan) to ‘Pardesi pardesi jaana nahi’ (Raja Hindustani) to ‘Do dil mil rahe hain’ (Pardes) were as popular among the college crowd as the truck drivers on the highway. The pair won the Filmfare award three years in a row, 1991-93, for ‘Aashiqui’, ‘Saajan’ and ‘Deewana’ and again in 1997 for ‘Raja Hindustani’. It seemed that the two would rule over Bollywood for another decade or two. But things were never the same after Nadeem’s name cropped up in the killing of a music baron and he fled to London. The duo still kept providing scores together in films such as ‘Kasoor’ and ‘Dhadkan’. The two split once, then reunited. This time, sadly, the separation is final.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-covid-claims-bollywood-composer-shravan-rathod/articleshow/82204101.cms||---

The corporators of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) have demanded that the civic administration start the facilities at the earliest. Though the NMC started the facilities last week, they had to be stopped within a few days. According to NMC medical superintendent Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the MRI and CT scan machines could not start due to non-availability of the films required. “But we are in the process of getting the films by Thursday evening and both the facilities will be started from Friday,” said Nagargoje. He said that the work order had been given to the company for procurement of the machines. Though the machines were procured, they sat idle due to lack of the technicians. “We have appointed technicians and they have been given training. We will start both the MRI and the CT scan facilities once we get the films,” added Nagargoje. Earlier, senior Shiv Sena corporator Sudhakar Badgujar said that though funds amounting to Rs 26 crore were approved for the facilities during Kumbh Mela around five years back, the NMC administration has failed to start the units. Chairperson of NMC standing committee Ganesh Gite has directed the civic administration to start the facilities at the Bytco by Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/mri-ct-scan-units-at-bytco-hosp-yet-to-start/articleshow/82201765.cms||Tushar Pawar

While the majority of hospitals have hired vehicles just to ferry oxygen from refill plants continuously, doctors have also devised methods to help each other. Dr Sunil Popat, director of Nidhi Hospital, said that hospitals often come to each other’s aid. “We have run out of oxygen a few times in the past month, whereas we have also reached out to our colleagues in distress,” he said. On the supply side, compared to 75 metric tonnes (MT) that Gujarat used exactly a month ago, the number has shot up to 1,000 MT, a 13-times increase. “While production has been pushed up by another 100-200 MT, demand remains largely the same, leaving little surplus or elbow room,” said a senior state government official. To put the figure in perspective, Ahmedabad city alone added 4,143 new cases in 24 hours. The city for the first time crossed 5,000 daily cases at 5,142, against which the number of discharged and dead patients was 999. “Even with a conservative estimate of 25% patients needing oxygen beds, over 1,000 will be out today scurrying for a bed,” said a city-based hospital owner. “Half of our energy is invested in managing resources alone.” Dr Rohit Joshi, chairman of Aarna Hospital, said, “The scarcity of oxygen is why we often have to turn down patients even when beds are vacant.” Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), said oxygen has become a life-and-death issue for several private hospitals. “Streamlining oxygen supply is today more important for patients than even remdesivir,” he said, adding that over 85% of hospitals treating Covid patients are entirely dependent on oxygen cylinders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/oxygen-use-in-state-up-13-times-in-30-days/articleshow/82203233.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC notice to NHAI over land acquisition||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Thursday issued notice to the National Highway Authority of India Ltd (NHAI) and the Centre over petitions filed by tribals from Jhalod taluka of Dahod district challenging land acquisition process for the highway project under Bharatmala Pariyojna. The landowners have challenged the acquisition process for Delhi-Mumbai Expressway on the ground that the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 2013 have not been properly followed. Moreover, there was no prior consultation with the local civic bodies in the tribal area, which is a requirement under the Panchayat (Extension of Scheduled Areas) Act. Petitioners’ advocate Anand Yagnik submitted that the petitioners are tribals and area is predominantly a tribal area and is governed by the the PESA Act. The law mandates a consultation with gram sabha or panchayat before acquisition of land before resettling and rehabilitating project affected people. This did not happen before the authority issued final notification in December 2020. It was also submitted that the 2013 land acquisition laws require the authority to take consent of gram sabha or panchayat or autonomous district councils in scheduled areas before starting the land acquisition process before issuance of notification under the Land Acquisition Act or any other central law, which is the National Highways Act in this case. The petitioners claimed that the acquiring body itself is required to conduct the Social Impact Assessment Study and the Resettlement Action Plan, which has not been done in this case by the acquiring body. This makes issuance of notification for land acquisition bad in law, the petition submitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-notice-to-nhai-over-land-acquisition/articleshow/82204099.cms||---

The victim, Sheetal Chaudhary, a resident of Pune, had gone to meet her mother on the occasion of Gudi Padwa, said the Kej police. The alleged murder was witnessed by her 10-year-old daughter and based on her account, police have booked the victim’s brother and his friend, both of whom are at large, said police. Sheetal’s husband died a couple of years ago and she was staying in Pune with her daughter. She worked for a private firm to support her family. Inspector Pradeep Tribhuvan said the victim, along with her daughter, were sleeping when the suspects allegedly attacked her, killing her on the spot. A spot panchanama has revealed that apart from strangulation, the woman was also attacked on the head with a sharp-edged weapon. Citing some family members, police said that the victim’s brother suspected that she was in a relationship with a man from Osmanabad district. The suspicion had resulted into differences between the two. Based on the complaint lodged by the deceased’s cousin, Nanasaheb Gavhane, police have registered a case of murder against the suspects and have formed teams to nab them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/widow-murdered-brother-among-2-booked/articleshow/82201782.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Industrial units forced shut sans oxygen supply||AHMEDABAD: A number of industrial units have been forced to shut down after the supply of industrial oxygen was diverted for medical requirements following the steep surge in Covid cases. Oxygen is widely used in steel-cutting and engineering units. It is also utilised in industries involving HVAC (Heat Ventilation and Air Conditioning) processes. In the current scenario, most units are unable to continue with their business operations. A unit based in Matoda industrial area, which manufactures compressors for air conditioners, has been rendered inoperative for five days due to zero supply of oxygen. “We manufacture compressors for air conditioners but oxygen supply to our plant has been shut since last 10-15 days. Initially, we managed with buffer stock. Four days ago, we exhausted even that and were compelled to shut our manufacturing operations completely. The situation is critical for our business because we have export obligations to fulfil. With complete halt in production, we are not sure how that will be handled,” said a supply-chain management professional at the factory. Similar is the situation at engineering units as well. Niraj Shah, who owns an engineering goods unit in the Sanand Industrial Estate, said, “Our unit has been completely shut for the past five days now. With no supply of oxygen for industries, metal-cutting and welding processes cannot be undertaken. As a consequence, we have no choice but to shut operations. Our plant has been shut for past six days.” Shah also mentioned that the situation worsened because majority of their labourers, who are also migrants, and some are in a confusion on whether to leave for their home state given the uncertainty of the situation. Oxygen manufacturers too on the other hand are helpless due to the mandate of the state government. “In Alang ship breaking yard, most units are shut or are operating at one-fourth of their staff; thanks to limited supply of oxygen. Some are operating with help of bottling plants which operate on the oxygen separation method,” said Chetan Patel of Shree Ram Group of Companies, which owns a ship-breaking facility in Alang.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/industrial-units-forced-shut-sans-oxygen-supply/articleshow/82203190.cms||Niyati Parikh

Karan Vaghela, 21, from Kheda was arrested on charges of helping one Manish Solanki in abducting and raping a girl, who was not even 15 years of age. Aslali police registered an offence against Solanki and arrested him under IPC charges as well as for violation of provisions under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. Vaghela, too, was accused of being an accomplice in this offence that had allegedly taken place on February 15. He also came to be arrested after Solanki. During the hearing of his bail application, Vaghela’s advocate submitted that Vaghela did not even know the main accused, Solanki, who had allegedly eloped with the teen. “He had no connection either with the accused or with the victim in this case. He was driving his auto and dropped off the couple where the main accused had instructed him to He had treated them as passengers only. For this, he cannot be booked and detained,” the lawyer submitted. He also submitted that the main accused in the case was granted bail 15 days ago, so it was not proper to keep the auto driver behind bars. He requested to grant the benefit of the parity. The prosecution, on the other hand, opposed the bail plea and asserted that Vaghela was an accomplice and he may tamper with evidence, if released on bail.After the hearing, additional sessions judge M P Purohit said that Vaghela should be given the benefit of parity and ordered to release him on conditional bail after furnishing bond of Rs 15,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/auto-driver-gets-bail-in-pocso-case/articleshow/82204110.cms||---
---||Meerut||Meerut: Technician posts video days before he dies of Covid-19||MEERUT: As a lab technician, Anshul Upadhyay, 38, had been working through days and nights collecting samples for Covid-19 tests, especially since the second wave began. On Friday, he tested positive. On Tuesday night, he died. But not before posting a video. “My name is Anshul. I have been admitted here since the day before yesterday,” he is heard saying in the video that he posted on Sunday, which later went viral. “I am not being given proper treatment here. Since morning, I have been finding it difficult to breathe. Whoever comes here, checks my pulse and leaves. I keep asking for an injection but no one listens. The staff is on strike. If this sort of treatment is meted out to a health worker, can you imagine what must be happening to ordinary people?” It was not clear which "strike" he was talking about. Anshul, who worked at the Abdullahpur Primary Health Centre (PHC), had been admitted to the Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial (LLRM) Medical College on Friday. “He was a lab technician who doubled up as a sample collector for Covid-19 tests. He had been working without taking a day off. We had been under immense pressure to meet targets (of taking samples),” his senior at the PHC, Dr Rubal Bakshi, who has also tested positive for Covid-19, said. “When he was admitted … he used to call me incessantly, asking for help. It was only when his video went viral that he was provided with oxygen.” His family said he was not given food for two days, after which he escaped. He got home on Tuesday afternoon. “He had come home and was very hungry. He had not been provided food,” his father Ved Prakash Upadhyay said. Later that day, they got a call from the hospital authorities threatening to lodge an FIR — as a likely Covid-19 patient, his movement would be in violation of The Epidemic Diseases Act. His family took him back to the hospital, where he died on Tuesday night. Principal of LLRM Medical College Dr Gyanender Singh said, “We monitor patients closely round the clock. We have received (Anshul’s) video. Its authenticity is being verified. If any discrepancy (in Covid care) is found, the culprit will be penalised.” This came against the backdrop of contractual medical staff and anganwadi workers of the PHC, his colleagues, demanding better working conditions. On Thursday, they sought compensation for Anshul’s family and a job for his wife. “We are working in adverse conditions, constantly exposing ourselves to the virus,” Pinky Yadav, a staff nurse at the Abdullahpur PHC, said. “The least we deserve are decent medical facilities when one of us is infected.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/lab-technician-posts-video-of-bad-hosp-state-days-before-he-dies-of-covid/articleshow/82202381.cms||Sandeep Rai

The decision was taken at the special general body meeting held through video conferencing on Thursday. Mayor Rakhi Kancharlawar proposed that the hospital will come up at the newly-built shelter home for homeless people. The hospital will cost Rs 2.25 crore and CMC have plans to increase the number of beds in a phased manner. It will be the first Covid hospital of CMC. CMC has been running vaccination and Covid test centres and providing institutional quarantine facility at its Covid care centre. Commissioner Rajesh Mohite claimed that the hospital will be equipped with all the facilities. “It will oxygen supply and ventilator beds,” he said. Mohite claimed that CMC has inspected Barrister Rajabhau Khobragade hall in Babupeth to start yet another Covid hospital. Civic body is also planning to utilize the Rs1 crore fund given by MLA Kishor Jorgewar for building a Covid treatment facility. The civic chief said that relatives of deceased patients will not be permitted near the body at the time of funeral.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/chandrapur-civic-body-to-start-45-bed-covid-hospital/articleshow/82204107.cms||---
---||India||PM Narendra Modi, Amit Shah, JP Nadda, Mamata Banerjee cancel poll rallies in West Bengal||NEW DELHI: In the wake of the surge in Covid cases, PM Narendra Modi and senior BJP leaders, including home minister Amit Shah and party president J P Nadda, will not hold any physical rallies in West Bengal for the remaining two phases and address voters virtually from Friday onwards. As Modi will have a busy day with meetings on Friday, he decided to skip the West Bengal visit and will address one rally virtually. “Tomorrow, I will be chairing high-level meetings to review the prevailing Covid-19 situation. Due to that, I will not be going to West Bengal,” the PM tweeted on Thursday. BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said the PM had to cancel his visit to Bengal on April 23, during which he was scheduled to address four rallies across four districts. Times ViewThe Left, Congress and TMC have already called off public meetings from the ongoing state election campaign. PM Modi’s decision is a right step in the same direction. However, with two phases of the poll still left, it would be more prudent that BJP calls off all public rallies.“BJP Bengal unit and the voters of West Bengal were looking forward to his visit but we realise the gravity of the situation and the rationale for him not being able to make it in person,” Ghosh said. “Accordingly, the PM will address voters of West Bengal, particularly voters of Malda, Murshidabad, Birbhum and Kolkata, through a virtual medium at 5 pm on Friday,” he added. Shah had three rallies scheduled on Thursday, but he addressed just one and cancelled the others. Defence minister Rajnath Singh's office said he has cancelled his visits to the state scheduled on April 23 and 26. However, the party has made extensive plans for a hybrid model of campaigning for the remaining two phases. There will be at least 65 locations across four poll-bound districts where the PM’s speech will be relayed live. Similar format is being planned for other leaders, including Shah and Nadda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-narendra-modi-amit-shah-jp-nadda-mamata-banerjee-cancel-poll-rallies-in-west-bengal/articleshow/82206373.cms||Akhilesh Singh
---||Mumbai||Just a quarter of 3.9 crore aged 45+ in Maharashtra have taken 1st jab||MUMBAI: Merely 25% of the estimated population of 3.9 crore aged above 45 years in the state has taken the first dose of the Covid vaccine since the category became eligible for it on March 1. Numbers further show the ratio of vaccination varies widely between districts; ranging from 9% in Hingoli and Nandurbar to 51% in Kolhapur, which officials say was largely due to vaccine stockouts. After Kolhapur, districts including Bhandara, Nagpur, Pune and Sangli occupy the top five spots when it comes to the percentage of coverage. In absolute numbers, though, Mumbai appears on the top with 14.6 lakh (38%) from the age group having received one dose, followed by Pune that has given the first jab to 14.2 lakh covering more than 40%. In all, only 95 lakh from this age group have taken the first dose, which many districts have blamed on factors such as shortage of vaccine stocks, surge in cases to hesitancy. Maharashtra that has administered the highest vaccine doses in the country at 1.3 crore, including 1.2 crore first doses and 15.8 lakh second doses, has lagged behind in giving second doses. Compared to the state, UP, Rajasthan and MP are leading the chart, having completed vaccination for 18 lakh, 16.9 lakh and 16.8 lakh people, respectively. Despite several attempts, Maharashtra’s immunisation in-charge Dr D Patil couldn’t be reached for a comment. In certain districts, officials said there was no lack of enthusiasm, but shortage broke the momentum. Kolhapur that tops the coverage chart started with awareness campaigns from the beginning and even saw panchayats building them pandals to carry out drives. Dr Yogesh Sale, district health officer, said they started with 232 vaccination centres, nearly double of Mumbai’s numbers, and saw good participation from people. “People came in hordes till doses thinned,” he said. In Chandrapur, officials said they have managed to cover 21% of the target population via 165 centres. “A few days ago, we received 14,000 doses which got over in two days. With the surge, all are looking for protection, but we don’t have doses,” said Dr Raj Gahlot, district health officer. In Mumbai, daily turnout jumped to 48,152. But doses are in short supply and the city has just 50,000 that will last a day, said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer. On Thursday, 49 private centres couldn’t carry out the drive. People haven’t been able to get appointment on Co-Win. On the weekend, BMC centres will stay open.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/just-a-quarter-of-3-9-crore-aged-45-in-maharashtra-have-taken-1st-jab/articleshow/82204121.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Constable Yogender Singh who was posted in Seohara police station did not return to duty even after the conclusion of the sanctioned leave. According to police sources, Yogender was using his position as police personnel to influence voters in favour of his kin. Giving the details, Bijnor SP Dharamveer Singh said, "Yogendra Singh from Jaskauli village of Sambhal district was posted here in Bijnor. He went on leave for six days on April 5. He was supposed to return to duty on April 11, but he did not join work." "There has been a complaint against him that he was using his position to influence the voters in favour of his wife and sister in-law. He was allegedly intimidating the people by misusing his uniform." "The constable's relatives contested in the panchayat poll for the post of village head. They were candidates from different villages. We had set up an inquiry and found the allegations to be true. So, I have suspended the head constable with immediate effect on Wednesday for dereliction of duty and indiscipline," the Bijnor SP added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/cop-suspended-for-influencing-voters-in-favour-of-sister-in-law/articleshow/82202384.cms||Harveer Dabas

---||Delhi||Delhi: How this doorstep delivery is saving lives||NEW DELHI: With the number of Covid-positive cases spiralling to unheard of heights, families and medical institutions have been struggling with hospital beds and oxygen cylinders. But unknown to most, cooked meals have also become a huge problem for many people.  Fortunately, in the era of Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, citizens have stepped forward to prepare and deliver food to Covid-hit families or those affected by the weeklong lockdown. Some households are unable to prepare meals due to Covid isolation. Class XII student Avantika was deeply moved by such problems. Two weeks ago, she asked her parents if they could start distributing food to quarantined Covid patients. “My parents agreed immediately and we started a week ago,” said Avantika. “My parents are both great cooks and since their work was suspended due to the lockdown, it was a great opportunity to assist others. We get around 50 requests a day but are able to respond to only around 30.” Puja Bahri knows what about the challenges of fighting the coronavirus infection, having been a patient herself last year. So, she decided to prepare and deliver home food to people in southeast Delhi’s New Friends Colony who are unable to cook at home. Pitampura resident Abha too has been feeding such families. “There are so many Covid cases around us,” she said. “I cook every day for my family so I might as well cook extra food for people who need meals. I am doing it free of cost.” In east Delhi, Bonku Roy and her family are involved in this good work. “In a WhatsApp group, the members started discussing voluntary cooking for Covid patients. I promptly volunteered and my family backed the idea,” said Roy. “We get around 100 requests every day, but regrettably, we are able to respond to around 80 and serve them meals twice daily.” The Halduniya family of south Delhi, whose many members were infected by the coronavirus last year, swore to make things easier for those who had contracted the disease this year. “This is the least that we can do,” said Priyanka Halduniya, who serves home-cooked meals to people in and around Safdarjang. “My elderly mother-in-law and father-in-law also contribute in the meal preparation for around 35 families.” After giving meals to the migrant labourers last year, Dr Ruchi Mittal continued with the commercial kitchen she had started. “With Covid rising, we began getting requests for home-cooked food,” said Mittal. “Since most of my staff of 10 aren’t coming to work due to the lockdown, we are unable to cater to every request.” Families that cannot afford to pay get free food from Navneet, who runs MCKS Food for the Hungry. He charges only those who can. Ashwini Shroff too does the same. “I started the service on April 14 April and get around 600 calls every day,” said Shroff. “We distribute around 200 food packages in the day and around 200 at night.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-this-doorstep-delivery-is-saving-lives/articleshow/82204115.cms||Pankhuri Yadav
---||Ahmedabad||Cylinder makers in Kutch halt exports to meet demand||AHMEDABAD: Top manufacturers of seamless cylinders — namely Everest Kanto Cylinder and Rama Cylinders — have stopped exporting oxygen cylinders from their plants in Kutch to serve the domestic market only. The move to cater to the domestic requirement has come in due to the spike in demand for oxygen cylinders following a massive surge in the use of the lifesaving gas at hospitals across the country. Both Everest Kanto and Rama Cylinders operate seamless cylinder manufacturing plants in Kandla Special Economic Zone (KASEZ). Rama Cylinders also runs a plant at Bhimsar in Anjar. “Both Everest Kanto Cylinder and Rama Cylinders have agreed to stop the exports of oxygen cylinders from their plants in the Kandla SEZ and supply the cylinders to the domestic market only. Even plants outside the SEZ area have also agreed to halt exports to meet domestic demand,” said Dr Amiya Chandra, Zonal Development Commissioner, Kandla Special Economic Zone (KASEZ). When contacted, the sources in these companies confirmed that the exports have been halted to serve the local markets. Industry players further stated that the demand for oxygen cylinders has jumped 200-300% over the past 15 days and the cylinder manufacturers are flooded with orders and inquiries from across the state. To raise the production of oxygen cylinders, these manufacturers have also stopped making cylinders for CNG and they are currently focusing on manufacturing only oxygen cylinders, said sources privy to the information. According to sources, these two companies’ plants in Kutch have cumulatively made 27,000 cylinders since the Monday last week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cylinder-makers-in-kutch-halt-exports-to-meet-demand/articleshow/82203184.cms||Kalpesh Damor
---||Nagpur||Pvt bus operators to stop service after state’s Q order||Nagpur: Peeved by the order by the state government to ‘break the chain’, most private bus operators in the state have decided to stop services from Friday. On April 21, the state issued an order that private buses can ply between inter-district and inter-city only for emergency or essential services or valid reasons with 50% capacity. Essential services have been defined as medical emergencies or people attending funerals. Violations would invite a fine of Rs 10,000. Secondly, the buses will have only two stoppages in cities and operator will have to put a stamp on the hand of alighting passengers for 14 days’ quarantine. Besides, local disaster management authority (DMA) may decide on a rapid antigen test (RAT) with the help of private labs and cost will have to be borne by the passenger. “The order is ambiguous. How will you verify the emergency? Though it directly ban operation of buses, the order amounts to that. When there will be no passengers, why operate the buses and sustain losses? The operators are yet to come out of the shock of the first lockdown,” said Prasanna Patwardhan, president, Maharashtra Rajya Truck, Tempo, Tanker, Bus Vahatuk Mahasangh. “The association has left the decision about running buses to the individual operator as the order doesn’t stop it completely,” Patwardhan added. Mahendra Luley, president, Bus & Car Operators Confederation of India (BOCI), Maharashtra, said, “The order is such that you cannot choose between the two. There are at least 250 private buses operating to various destinations from Nagpur. Buses to MP and Chhattisgarh have already stopped last month. Some operations in Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh were on but those too will be shut now.” Even the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) officials are confused about following the stamping condition. Like specific direction to private operators to stamp passengers, the order is not clear whether a similar procedure has to be followed by the MSRTC. “We have been told the job of stamping for 14-day quarantine will be done by the health and revenue department staff at check-posts and bus stops. They will also do thermal scanning and RAT, if needed. Those found positive will be sent to nearest quarantine centres for 14 days,” said divisional controller Nilesh Belsare. “The state’s idea is to prevent unnecessary travel by people. With home quarantine threat, we don’t expect many people travelling. We are also going to cross-check whether the passengers are travelling for a genuine reason,” said Belsare. Meanwhile, NMC has started screening railway passengers arriving from Goa, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Kerala, Uttarakhand, and Delhi. “On Wednesday, RAT was done on four passengers but they tested negative. On Thursday, two passengers tested negative. At least 1,400 passengers arrive via 17 trains from these six states that are being screened,” said railway officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pvt-bus-operators-to-stop-service-after-states-q-order/articleshow/82204129.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Hyderabad||Telangana high court comes to rescue of ex-NSG commando||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Thursday directed the state government to immediately sanction financial assistance to a crippled NSG commando so that he can construct a house. The government assured in October 2018 that it would construct a house for the commando, Kanagala Sriramulu, free of cost after allotting a 300 square yard plot on the outskirts of Hyderabad. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy on Thursday directed the finance secretary to either sanction the money or appear before the court. Last month when the case was heard, the judges had asked the state government to inform the court whether any decision was taken. Sriramulu defused three live bombs during a terror attack on Indian Air Force base at Pathankot in Punjab on January 2, 2016, and saved several lives but was rendered severely crippled when the fourth one exploded on him in the process. When Radhive Reddy, counsel for the state, said the matter was pending with the finance secretary, the judges said it was summoning him to the court. The state counsel then pleaded with them not to summon the official. “The district collector has recommended some financial assistance. The finance secretary is exploring ways to help,” he said. At this, the judges said: “Let him sanction the fund in the mean time. He need not come. But, he has to appear before the court if he fails to sanction the fund.” The case was posted to first week of June. The PIL was taken up by the court four years ago after learning about the plight of Sriramulu through media reports. He was found in a crippled state in his Hyderabad residence and it was becoming difficult for his family to meet the huge medical expenses. The Centre in 2017 said its medical board would soon meet to declare him physically unfit to remain in service and would, thereafter, hand over terminal benefits to the commando.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-comes-to-rescue-of-ex-nsg-commando/articleshow/82205213.cms||---

---||Patna||Bihar set to procure Covishield from SII||PATNA: In the wake of the Centre allowing the states to buy Covid vaccines directly from the manufacturers, the Bihar government has decided to procure Covishield from Serum Institute of India (SII), Pune, for vaccinating people above the age of 18 from May 1. CM Nitish Kumar has already announced that free Covid vaccines for everyone above 18. Pratyaya Amrit, the health department principal secretary, said the procurement order is likely to be placed by late evening on Thursday. "Altogether 5.46crore people in the 18-44 age group have been identified for vaccination in the next phase starting May 1. As SII has announced its rates for procurement by states, we have decided to place our first order ahead of the commencement of vaccination of people above the age of 18," Pratyaya told reporters in an online briefing on Thursday evening. “The strategy for vaccinating people above 18 years of age will ready by Friday. The state government will place more orders for vaccines, so that inoculation can be carried out on a war- footing,” Pratyaya further said. Earlier on Monday, the Centre announced its strategy for phase-3 of vaccination against Covid, which included inoculation of everyone above 18. It stated that vaccine manufacturers would supply 50% of their monthly production to the central government and they would be free to supply the remaining 50% to the state governments and in the open market (private hospitals). Manufacturers have also been asked to declare their prices for the supply to state governments and open markets. SII announced that it will charge Rs400 per dose for Covishield from the state and Rs600 per dose from private hospitals from May 1, when open for all adults. Apart from SII, the Centre has also authorised the emergency use of Covaxin, an indigenously manufactured Covid vaccine by Bharat Biotech International Limited in association with ICMR and Russian vaccine Sputnik, which is to be manufactured soon in India as well. "The rates of Covaxin and Sputnik are yet to be announced. Hence, a decision by the Bihar government for procuring those vaccines will be taken accordingly," Pratyaya said on Thursday. Meanwhile, the ministry of health and family welfare stated on Thursday that state governments are free to procure Covid vaccine doses from the vaccine manufacturers as per the liberalised pricing and accelerated vaccination strategy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-set-to-procure-covishield-from-sii/articleshow/82202716.cms||Piyush Tripathi
---||Chandigarh||Hry shops to shut at 6pm from today||Chandigarh: The Haryana government has decided to close shops dealing in non-essential items in crowded markets from 6 pm as a precautionary measure in view of the rapid increase in the Covid-19 cases. The decision would come into force from Friday. Standalone stores located in less crowded areas would be exempted from the revised timings, said chief minister but added that deputy commissioner of each district would take a final decision on this. Haryana had recently capped the number of attendees in indoor events to 50 and in open spaces to 200 and imposed night curfew from 10 pm to 5 am. The state also decided to ban all non-essential gatherings. “All shops will remain closed from 6 pm onward in Haryana from tomorrow, all non-essential gatherings are banned, anybody holding any function within the prescribed limit will have to seek permission from concerned SDM (sub-divisional magistrate),” state home and health minister Anil Vij said in a tweet. The state government has also instructed private hospitals to reserve 50% beds for Covid-19 patients, said Khattar during an informal interaction with journalists after the cabinet meeting. Khattar said 170 metric tonnes of oxygen is being supplied to Delhi between 10 pm and 6 am from the Panipat plant. Furthermore, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal had also expressed satisfaction over the supply of oxygen from the plant, asserted Khattar. On a question regarding the current status of availability of beds with ventilators for Covid-19 patients in the hospitals across Haryana, the CM said the information about the availability of beds had been uploaded online in Gurgaon and Faridabad districts. Besides this, around 500 beds have been arranged at Sgt Medical College, Gurgaon, 150 beds are being arranged in the industrial area and 50 more beds have been arranged from Thursday. The CM also said that the Indian Army has also taken the initiative of helping the state. DRDO is also making arrangements for 500 beds each in Panipat and Hisar for Covid-19 patients. Regarding the wastage of vaccine doses, CM said that in Haryana, the wastage of Covid-19 vaccine is only 1.5%, which is within the prescribed limit. Charges for ventilator beds fixed The CM said that as per infrastructure facilities offered in private hospitals, the charges of ventilator beds are fixed from Rs 8,000 to Rs 18,000. If a hospital charges more than this, then strict action will be taken against such hospital, provided if any complaint in this regard is received, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hry-shops-to-shut-at-6pm-from-today/articleshow/82204113.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Patna||Bihar: Kin of Covid victims struggle to find hearse for their dear ones in Bettiah||BETTIAH: Giving a morbid competition to the Manhattans on the IPL score sheet graphs, the Covid figures are surging menacingly across the state. West Champaran recorded a whopping 1,002 Covid positive cases on Thursday. “The total number of active cases in the district has risen to 2,007 till last evening,” civil surgeon Arun K Sinha said on Thursday, adding, “Of the 163 active containment zones in the district, 99 are in rural areas. Urban clusters account for 64 containment zones,” he said. While the majority of Covid-positive patients are being advised home isolation, the stream of serious patients to the Government Medical College, though seeing some discharges on recovery to the satisfaction of the stressed medical teams on duty, is also resulting in mortalities. With the death of five patients on Thursday, the reported death toll in West Champaran has risen to 23. This excludes cases like that of Irshad Ali Rizvi, a Bettiah civil court clerk who succumbed while quarantined at his home in Muzaffarpur. The Bettiah Civil Court was closed when a large number of employees tested positive and the court premises was feared to have become a super spreader. Since then, two lawyers and an advocate-clerk have succumbed to the virus. The descent of hapless concern into grief amongst the kin of the Covid patients was heart-wrenching outside the dedicated Covid ward at the GMC on Thursday that saw five deaths within hours. Eyewitnesses said the relatives of the deceased were running from pillar to post in search of a hearse. As Sushil Mahto(45) was lying wrapped in a body bag, Mani Bhushan Mahto-the deceased’s son in law- was seen frantically making phone calls. “He had just returned from Delhi. I admitted him on Tuesday. Now I am unable to find an ambulance to carry his body for last rites,” the kin told reporters outside the hospital. Similar tales unfolded for the next of kin of Saraswati Devi (50) and Baby Kumari Chauhan (35). Baby Kumari’s wailing husband, Amit Singh, held on to Arnav, his four-year-old son. Reporters helped him with official phone numbers but phones were difficult to reach. “DM sahib ka phone laga par hamari baat sun kar koi jawab nahin diye,” he cried. “We arranged for an ambulance for his wife’s funeral as soon as DM informed me,” hospital superintendent Pramod K Tiwary told this reporter. “Dead bodies are being kept in body bags at the hospital mortuary till hearse and officials are available to accompany the family for the funeral as per Covid protocol,” Tiwary said, adding, the hospital has just one mortuary van. “We have to arrange ambulances if there are more bodies as it is today,” he said. When this reporter repeatedly tried the hospital manager’s number, a poignant Bollywood number played out in an ironically macabre twist: “Barbaadiyon ka sog manana fizul tha, barbadiyon ka jashn manata chala gaya...” (It was useless to rue one’s ruin, so kept on celebrating ruination). A WHO Block-level worker, Sachin Agarwal, admitted his 62-year-old mother Chandar Devi to a private hospital five days ago. “But the ventilator there began failing and I rushed to admit Ma in GMC yesterday,” he said over the phone adding that his mother’s oxygen level hovered around 80. “A doctor came and started the ventilator yesterday. Today another doctor came on the round in the morning but no doctor has visited since then,” he rued, claiming that he was able to get his mother’s treatment going only after reaching out to the local MLA and Bihar’s deputy CM Renu Devi. On Thursday evening, just before filing this report, Sachin again took this reporter’s call. “Sir, Ma died around 1 pm. I am waiting for an ambulance to perform her last rites,” his voice was choked. Late on Thursday afternoon, school teacher Samuel Ghimire (46) became the day’s fifth casualty at the Bettiah hospital. His wife, Eda (42), was left alone in her own battle for survival in the Covid ward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/kin-of-covid-victims-struggle-to-find-hearse-for-their-dear-ones-in-bettiah/articleshow/82202766.cms||Abhay Mohan Jha

---||Nagpur||Pedestrians at core of Sitabuldi main road makeover plan||Nagpur: Sitabuldi, the city’s most bustling commercial pocket, promises to become pedestrian-friendly. The redevelopment of the 1km long Variety Square-Loha Pul Square Sitabuldi main road envisages earmarking 84% of the road space for pedestrians. Currently, a major portion of the Sitabuldi main road is gobbled up by hawkers, moving and parked vehicles, roadside venders leaving a mere 5% for the pedestrians. This are findings of a study carried out under ‘Reimagining Sitabuldi Market’ proposal prepared by Sumit Asia Architects, Nagpur (SAA) and The Blank Slate (TBS), Mumbai. As winners of the Street for People Challenge (an initiative by Smart Cities Mission, MoHUA, Government of India), architects and urban designers from SAA and TBS aim to transform the bustling Sitabuldi market into a vibrant public space for Nagpurians to grow, pause, reflect and express. The main challenge in this competition rolled out by Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL) was to expand the potential of the street by proposing new activities while placing maximum focus on enhancing the shopping experience. The overflowing pedestrian movement, increased vehicular traffic and on-street parking leads to a chaos on the road for almost the entire day. Sagarika Nambiar, an architect at TBS, said that the ‘Vision Sitabuldi district’ untangles the existing chaotic system to create a dynamic, vibrant, secure, and inclusive shopping street that encourages walking and gathering. The 30-metre wide road has been divided into eight lanes with a major portion dedicated for pedestrians, followed by hawkers and a smaller patch for eco-friendly motor vehicles. “Fortunately, the immediate neighbourhood is well-equipped with secondary roads, vacant grounds (within 5-minute walking distance), and shared parking opportunities in the nearby malls,” the study mentions. Applying a low-cost high-impact design strategy, as a salient feature of ‘tactical urbanism’, the distinct features were not only designed to allow better use of the street but also to provide a pleasant experience for the shoppers coming here. The safe and accessible crosswalks, a non-motorised vehicle (NMV) lane, e-rickshaw drop-off points, and pedestrian promenades are some features that figure in the proposed design. Also, there are provisions for an amenity plaza, dynamic linear park, pop-up events plaza, a hawkers’ plaza, and a food bazaar dispersed throughout the length of the street that offer new opportunities to expand the street’s potential to make it one of the most happening marketplaces of the city. The locally-sourced design materials (plastic crates, khadi fabrics used as shading devices, reusable tyre planters, etc, street patterns (concentric circles and morse codes), and repeated modules provide visual cohesion along the entire length of the street. “Running in tandem with our design proposal and timeline, a mobile application is also proposed which is a one-stop solution for all things one might want to know about Sitabuldi Street. Along with this, the application will also aid in collecting valuable feedback and opinions from the public over a social interface, rather than manually doing so on-site, decreasing the risk factor,” said Nambiar. The proposal is to create a public space that transforms from an outdoor fitness zone in the early morning hours to a crowded market street offering a dual-natured shopping experience all through the day and finally offering food street or a cultural fiesta at night. “In this transformation, we find a spark that ignites growth of a sustainable city and a city that is human-centric and nature-based,” she said. Safety in times of CovidIn response to the pandemic, the design has plans for measures such as a morse code pattern and circles spaced out by 6ft on the pedestrian walkway to ensure physical distancing, sanitization booths, and public toilets to ensure health and safety, acrylic screens on vendor carts for a safe shopping experience etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pedestrians-at-core-of-sitabuldi-main-road-makeover-plan/articleshow/82204170.cms||---

It comes days after a similar video, showing a patient drinking water from a washroom tap of Covid hospital, had surfaced. As the video went viral, the administration of Shamli immediately took cognizance of the matter and formed a panel of the doctors to visit the ward of the Covid-19 hospital. In the video clip, the man can be heard as saying that the patients are being looked after by untrained medical staff. “I am speaking from L-2 ward in Corona hospital of Shamli. There is sheer mismanagement here. No one is present here to manage these facilities.” He also can be seen showing the oxygen cylinders, which he said were leaking. On Wednesday, after taking cognizance of the viral video, district magistrate of Shamli, Jasjeet Kaur, directed the chief medical superintendent (CMS) to take action into the matter. “After taking cognizance of the viral video, CMS of the Covid-19 hospital was instructed that after every two hours doctors will visit Covid-19 ward to know the condition of the patients. And instruction has been given to form a medical team which will monitor the patients and will send me reports on the daily basis. I would like to tell you that we have doctors and enough oxygen and corona patients are being treated very well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/patient-alleges-defective-oxygen-cylinders-untrained-staff-at-covid-19-hospital-probe-on/articleshow/82202411.cms||Mohd Dilshad

During Ramzan, the dargah usually sees a massive crowd gathering during the iftar to break their fast with the food provided from its langar, functional for over 800 years. Hundreds of men, women and children turn up around the mausoleum every day during this period. The dargah was also shut during the last Ramzan due to the pandemic, and this year, too, the Nizamuddin Dargah Committee decided on April 16 to close it till April 30. Stating that the “decision was taken in respect of the current pandemic situation and the Delhi Disaster Management Authority guidelines”, Altamash Nizami, joint secretary of the committee, added that while the dargah would remain closed for public and devotees, they would continue to serve langar and iftar by making food boxes and distributing them in Nizamuddin Basti. Since the shutdown of the dargah, over 1,000 packets have been distributed. “We make sure that there is no crowd. We prepare boxes from the afternoon and deliver it well before the sunset to the homes of the Nizamuddin basti neighbourhood,” Nizami told TOI. Many homeless people who live on the footpath and under the Nizamuddin flyover also get their share, he added. “We have vegetarian food with vegetarian biryani and for iftar, we give pakoda, biscuit, juice and other items. The committee members pay for the food and people also donate for charity,” Nizami said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dargah-shut-but-its-iftari-feeds-scores-every-day/articleshow/82204148.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

He was upset over the Centre allocating just 5% of the four lakh vials the state needed to fight the surging Covid-19 cases in the second wave. He also said it was wrong of the Centre to take control of allocation instead of leaving it to the states to buy directly from manufacturers. Talking to reporters, he said the state government had ordered four lakh vials of remdesivir from Hyderabad-based manufactures, but the Centre sent a letter that vial allocation would be controlled by them henceforth. “It is unfortunate that after we negotiated with the manufacturers, the Centre sent a letter allocating us just 21,551 vials for the period between April 21 and 30,” he said. “During the same time, the Centre had allocated two lakh injections to Maharashtra, 1.62 lakh to Gujarat and 61,000 to Delhi .” He said that if the Centre was allocating the key anti-viral drug on the number of cases in a state, then it would be injustice to Telangana as patients from Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra are flooding hospitals in Hyderabad. “We are protesting the allocation,” he said. “We will write to the Union government against this. Hetero and other companies started manufacturing remdesivir in Hyderabad only after the state government negotiated with them to buy their stock.” He also said that he was ready to share the drug with other states. “This is the time to join hands. Remdesivir is locally manufactured but we are not saying ‘don’t send to other states’. We are saying give us our requirement. This is not a time for prejudices. Many patients from other states are coming here. We cannot say no to them as this is a national calamity, but if a shortage leads to problems, the Centre will have to take the blame.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-slams-centre-on-remdesivir-rationing/articleshow/82205215.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Manufacturers fight supply issues as O2 demand soars||Ahmedabad: The surge in Covid-19 cases in Gujarat has led to a massive increase in consumption of oxygen, leaving manufacturers and suppliers struggling to meet the growing demand. With more people requiring oxygen and the supply of oxygen cylinders being diverted to homes, manufacturers are attending to hundreds of calls every single day.Chetan Patel, founder, Shree Ram Oxy Gas said, “Against a daily supply of some 6 tonnes to a given hospital last week, demand has increased to 23 tonnes. We’re constantly coordinating with the district and municipal corporation authorities to ensure that adequate supply is made available to all those who require.”Yet another manufacturer and distributor of oxygen, said, “As the number of Covid-19 positive continues to grow, the demand for oxygen has jumped tenfold. Many people have started using oxygen at their homes as it is tough to find beds with oxygen at hospitals. This has further spiked the demand.”Oxygen distributors also complained that they are finding it very difficult to procure new cylinders for oxygen. “We are not getting new cylinders. If we get cylinders, we don't get oxygen flow meters, which are also a critical requirement,” the distributor added. While there has been some improvement in availability of liquid oxygen, the same gets used quickly as the demand far exceeds the supply, said oxygen suppliers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/manufacturers-fight-supply-issues-as-o2-demand-soars/articleshow/82203287.cms||Niyati Parikh

And more often than not, these warriors who are tagged on Twitter and Facebook posts with SOS posts are helping desperate patients and relatives. Some even get tagged for feeding stray animals left hungry amid the lockdown. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) functionary Ruben Mascarenhas wakes up to over a 100 posts and tags daily. “We’ve set up a helpline. We get hundreds of calls a day. Most requests are for Remdesivir followed by ICU beds. Once I am tagged, I get details and call the patient or relatives. Then we call the ward war room and follow up with them. We also call hospitals to get beds, based on local intelligence. For Remdesivir, we contact suppliers and connect them,” said Mascarenhas. Congress MLA Zeeshan Siddique gets a request almost every hour from relatives looking for Remdesivir or an ICU. “We get the most calls for ICU beds between 12 am and 6 am. In the day we get requests for oxygen beds and life-saving drugs. We’ve relaunched our helpline as not all are on social media. We get five calls a minute even in the middle of the night,” says Siddique who recovered from Covid last week. “Hi @zeeshan_iyc Sir Urgently need 5 doses of Remdisivir injection-100mg for friends Mother in Malad (E) please help. She's in very critical condition,” a user @RealHistoryPic tweeted on April 15 tagging Zeeshan. The next day, the vials were delivered. Yuva Sena functionary Rahul Kanal too gets tagged on Twitter many times a day. “We’ve been feeding stray animals for months. As there is a lockdown, many strays don’t get food. In the second wave we’re feeding stray animals across Mumbai for 24 days now. We distribute dog and cat food to NGOs that distribute in their areas,” Kanal says. “We even give packed food to cops on duty. We give them packed food through a truck that is always on the move.

---||Business||Hospitals can’t deny cashless Covid claims, rules Irdai||HYDERABAD: The insurance regulator on Thursday directed insurance companies to take ‘appropriate action’ against network hospitals denying cashless facility to Covid-19 patients. The advisory came at a time when companies say they are seeing higher Covid-related claims because private hospitals are denying the cashless facility and are overusing antibiotics. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman too tweeted about this on Thursday evening saying: “Reports are being received of some hospitals denying cashless insurance. Spoken to chairman, Irdai SC Khuntia to act immediately. In March’20 Covid included as a part of comprehensive health insurance. Cashless available at networked or even temporary hospitals.” Coronavirus: Live updatesShe also said that as on April 20, nearly 9 lakh Covid-related claims have been settled by insurance companies for Rs 8,642 crore. “Even tele-consultations can be covered. Irdai shall direct companies to prioritise authorisations and settlements of Covid cases,” her tweet read. Reports are being received of some hospitals denying cashless insurance. Spoken to Chairman, IRDAI Shri SC Khuntia… https://t.co/yJLYfoiNvF— Nirmala Sitharaman (@nsitharaman) 1619098989000The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) circular reads: “Insurers shall ensure that where the policyholder is notified about availability of cashless facility at the empanelled network provider, the cashless facility at such network provider shall be made available to the policyholders in accordance with the terms and conditions of the policy contract and as per the terms agreed in SLA.” Companies have also been told to ensure smooth availability of cashless facility. A major grouse of the insurers is that hospitals charge different rates for Covid treatment across the country. Bhabtosh Mishra, director underwriting, products & claims at Max Bupa Health Insurance, pointed out that during the first wave, the average length of a Covid patient’s stay in hospital was around 10 days. It dropped to seven days by the end of December 2020. “The average claims (in the first wave) used to be around Rs 1.3 lakh. However, in the second wave, while the average number of days of hospitalisation is still hovering around seven days, the claim size has increased to over Rs 1.4 lakh,” he added. “For instance, unlike last year, we are seeing use of high-end antibiotics, like injection Meropenem and Targocid, without providing much justification of its use. This has led to an increase in the overall size of claims,” he said. An official of an insurance company, who did not wish to be identified, said fraud claims management has also become a major issue as they have begun to see instances of false positive reports and cases of false hospitalisations. “In times of Covid, it becomes very difficult to physically visit hospitals and verify cases where we have doubts,” the official said. S Prakash, MD, Star Health and Allied Insurance said the lack of adherence to standardised treatment protocols is a major concern and this is not only burdening insurance players but patients as well. The head of a general insurance player also pointed out that there is a lot of panic among people as a result of which many are occupying beds when they do not need to. Another health insurance player’s official pointed out that they have come across cases where customers, despite sharing their single occupancy rooms with other patients due to lack of beds, were being charged single occupancy room rent, resulting in higher claims. Even Sanjay Datta, chief-underwriting, claims and reinsurance, ICICI Lombard General Insurance, added that it is not only about high Covid claims. He said overall health insurance claims are rising because many who had postponed health procedures last year have started going for it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hosps-cant-deny-cashless-covid-claims-rules-irdai/articleshow/82205221.cms||Swati Rathor
---||Jaipur||Covid-19: As active cases breach 1-lakh mark, Rajasthan grapples with oxygen shortage||JAIPUR: The health department’s projection on oxygen requirement for Covid patients failed drastically because of the unprecedented rise in active cases. The state government is now requesting the Centre to increase supply as active cases are rising sharply over the past seven days. While the state had anticipated 1 lakh active cases on April 25, the grim figure was breached on April 22, three days before the health department’s projection. A week ago, the health department had forecast 86,532 active cases on April 22, but it missed the prediction by more than 20,000. As on Thursday, active cases stood at 1,07,157, riding on a sharp increase in daily new infections. While the health department had anticipated that oxygen requirement would be between 165 and 170 metric tonnes (MT) on April 22, the demand rose to 260-270 MT due to sudden increase in active cases. Here too, the health department failed to gauge the oxygen requirement as it had predicted 250 MT around April 30. Now, the state government is making fresh projections on the basis of rising active cases and said it might need around 315 MT by April 30. Private hospitals are also facing a massive oxygen crisis. An attendant of a private facility was asked to arrange oxygen cylinder for its patient as the hospital had run short of the life-saving gas. The hospital owner told TOI that he had only three Covid patients on oxygen support, while the rest of them were mild cases. “We are not receiving oxygen supply. Since we are a small hospital, we asked the attendant to shift the patient to some other facility. Luckily, he managed to get a cylinder,” he said. Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Society (PHNHS) secretary Dr Vijay Kapoor informed Jaipur collector about the shortage of oxygen in private hospitals. “In most of the private hospitals, availability of oxygen is a major concern. Some do not have oxygen for even 24 hours,” said Kapoor. ESI Hospital, which was declared a dedicated Covid facility, started functioning from Thursday. The hospital did not admit patients on Wednesday since it did not receive oxygen. “Now, 25 patients have been admitted in the 126-bed hospital,” said Dr Narrottam Sharma, chief medical health officer, Jaipur-I.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/as-active-cases-breach-1-lakh-markstate-grapples-with-oxygen-shortage/articleshow/82204156.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

Previously, the city has witnessed intense crowding at inoculation centres each time a new group was allowed vaccination. With daily cases and deaths rising, there is fear psychosis among public, and hospitals are anticipating huge turn out from next month. Pediatrician Dr Satish Deopujari said people are absolutely anxious about the upcoming drive. “We will have to open up plenty of centres. Planning must be such that crowding is avoided. Odd and even hours can be adopted for the new group. We will have to create slots in time and space. It could be for women and men, and age-wise. Every area must have its multiple centres where residents can get vaccinated there only and need not travel outside. As a country, we are experts in handling masses. If we really organize it well, I don’t think it will a challenge,” he said. Niranjan S Joshi, senior manager, Marketing & Corporate Communication, Alexis Multispeciality Hospital, too said government should increase the centres. “Vaccination should be done by prior appointments and with time slots. More slots should be given to elderly than youngsters as they are more vulnerable. Each centre should have limited numbers every day. Like polio vaccines, NMC and the govt should form squads which can visit particular areas and vaccinate people at home,” he said. Critical care specialist Dr Imran Noor Mohammad said multiple big vaccination centres on open spaces must be set up. “To avoid crowding, cops can be deployed and at a time only one beneficiary must be allowed to go inside the vaccination room,” he said. However, KRIMS director Dr Ashok Arbat said he doesn’t feel there would be problem of crowding. “People will come with appointment as the new group is more tech savy. So naturally the rush will be less. It may be a different scene when the vaccine will be sold over the counter. Those working may have to adjust timing but between the 18 to 25 group can take the jab any time,” he said. Dr Arbat added that people are not coming for vaccination because of the lockdown. They may venture out for silly reasons but will not go for vaccination. They should be motivated to take the jab,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/multiple-big-centres-odd-even-slots-crowd-mgmt-needed-for-18-vax-drive/articleshow/82204161.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

According to the brother of one Harish Kumar (52), they had admitted him at a private hospital on Pilibhit bypass road as he had Covid-like symptoms. He died late on Wednesday night. The family was handed over the body on Thursday after they cleared the bills. But they found they were given someone else’s body. The hospital staff initially denied any mistake but after the deceased’s family members created a ruckus, they admitted that the body was mistakenly swapped with another. By that time, family members of one Rakesh Kumar discovered the “wrong” body at the crematorium and rushed back to the hospital. They staged a protest outside the hospital. Police were summoned and the matter was resolved with each family getting the body of their loved one.

---||India||ONGC kidnap probe reveals Ulfa-I hand: Cops||GUWAHATI: Investigation into the kidnapping of three ONGC employees at Lakuwa in Charaideo district in upper Assam in the wee hours of Tuesday has revealed the involvement of banned militant outfit, the United Liberation Front of Assam-Independent (Ulfa-I), said special director general of police, GP Singh, on Thursday. “Ulfa-I’s involvement has come to light in the abduction case. We have already identified the cadres involved. Moreover, the involvement of overground members of the group has also been found. We have already arrested one overground member,” said Singh. He also informed that police have picked up at least 30 people for allegedly conspiring to kidnap the worker. “All of them are being interrogated now,” the officer added. Talking about the motive behind the kidnapping, he said, “The kidnapping was either for ransom or an attempt to create instability in the state. Investigation and search operations are on.” The district superintendent of police, S Mishra, said all efforts are on to rescue the trio. Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Wednesday directed chief secretary Jishnu Baruah and director general of police Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta to take all steps to rescue the victims. Thereafter, Singh visited Lakuwa on Thursday. The employees -- Mohini Mohan Gogoi, Alakesh Saikia and Ritul Saikia -- were abducted by a group of five armed men, suspected to be Ulfa-I cadres, around 1.30am on Wednesday from a rig site at the Lakuwa oil field. The armed men took the employees in the company’s ambulance towards the Assam-Nagaland border. However, no rebel outfits have claimed responsibility for the abduction yet. The family members of the abducted employees have requested the outfit members to release them immediately. “I request them to release my son. My son has not done anything. Why did they kidnap the three, please release them,” they said. The incident happened just after four months of the last kidnapping incident. On December 21 last year, Ulfa (I) had abducted two employees of Quippo Oil, drilling superintendent Pranab Kumar Gogoi and radio operator Ram Kumar from Arunachal Pradesh. They were released on April 3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ongc-kidnap-probe-reveals-ulfa-i-hand-cops/articleshow/82206457.cms||Mukut Das
---||Ahmedabad||Use remdesivir only in severe cases: AMC||AHMEDABAD: In an appeal on Thursday, senior members of Indian Medical Association, Gujarat chapter, and Ahmedabad Medical Association appealed to the fraternity and members of public not to use Remdesivir indiscriminately. The appeal has come after a major spike in demand for the antiviral used for Covid-19 treatment. With 1.63 lakh injections, Gujarat was second only to Maharashtra (2.69 lakh) in state-wise allocation of remdesivir from April 21 to 30 in India. The signees of the appeal include neurologist Sudhir Shah, cardiologist Tejas Patel, AMA president Kirit Gadhvi, former AMA president Mona Desai, Indian Medical Association (Gujarat) president Devendra Patel and infectious diseases specialist Atul Patel. The appeal mentioned there are no studies that the drug can reduce mortality. It must be taken only if the patient has low oxygen saturation, breathlessness and medical condition for which they are kept on ventilator, sepsis or ECMO. The appeal was echoed by members of the state Covid taskforce who interacted with media in Gandhinagar on Thursday afternoon. The doctors appealed that its indiscriminate use can be harmful. Dr V N Shah, a member, said that the current pandemic situation would improve only through herd immunity. “This is the third World War. We are fighting against coronavirus. We can defeat this virus only by joining hands and understanding this disease properly,” he said. “The Centre has now allowed people above the age of 18 to get vaccinated (from May 1). It is important to bring in herd immunity.” During the press briefing, principal secretary (health) Jayanti Ravi informed about the change in treatment protocol for coronavirus patients with mild symptoms after studying AIIMS and other states’ protocols. The state has added ivermectin and favipiravir in the treatment protocol. Other suggestions included reverse quarantine of elderly, wearing face mask even while indoors, prone positioning to improve lung capacity and proper ventilation at home and workplaces as some ways to prevent infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/use-remdesivir-only-in-severe-cases-ama/articleshow/82203310.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Param Bir now faces inquiry for corruption on allegations made by cop||MUMBAI: The home department has ordered an inquiry against former police commissioner Param Bir Singh in connection with the allegations of corruption levelled against him by an inspector, said sources on Thursday. DGP Sanjay Pandey has been asked to investigate the allegations against Singh, said the sources. The allegations were levelled by police inspector Anup Dange, who was suspended from the force last year and reinstated recently. Dange claims Singh had demanded Rs 2 crore from him to revoke his suspension. The inspector had written a letter to the additional chief secretary (home) about Singh’s demand. Singh had denied the allegations. DGP Pandey was not available for comment. The inquiry would be the second one ordered by the state government against Singh. The home department had previously asked the DGP to conduct an inquiry against Singh for alleged dereliction of duty in connection with the investigation into the recovery of a vehicle with explosives near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, Antilia in south Mumbai, on February 25. Singh had been transferred from the post of police chief on March 17 after criticism of his handling of the Ambani case. On March 20, Singh wrote a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray alleging that the home minister at the time, Anil Deshmukh, had resorted to malpractices and asked police officer Sachin Waze to collect Rs 100 crore every month from bars and hotels. Deshmukh resigned from the state cabinet after the Bombay high court ordered a CBI inquiry into the allegations made by Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-param-bir-now-faces-inquiry-for-corruption-on-allegations-made-by-cop/articleshow/82205234.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Getting married? Register online first||AHMEDABAD: For those wanting to hold a wedding ceremony, a registration on the government website is essential, or else it would lead to action under the disaster management act and even for violating orders of police. The online registration also does away with the need to obtain written permissions for holding wedding ceremonies. Director general of police (DGP) Ashish Bhatia said on Thursday that the orders in this respect were issued by the government four months ago. The department has now made it mandatory to register online on the government website to hold wedding ceremonies. Bhatia said that once the information is provided on the website, cops from concerned police station can visit the venue and check the number of people present. He said that in case of any violation a case can be registered. Police said that so far it was mandatory for everyone to inform the local police station, but people rarely followed it. But now with online registration the information will reach the concerned police station. The police station too can be held liable if guest numbers at the venue exceed those permitted, as it falls within their duty to check the venue and guest numbers. Police said that recently chief minister Vijay Rupani had said that police officers will face action, if the Covid-19 restriction of not exceeding 50 guests at weddings was violated. The government had recently capped the number of guests at marriage venues to 50 and made online registration compulsory. A large number of weddings are lined up across the state on April 25, 26 and 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/getting-married-register-online-first/articleshow/82203354.cms||---

Two others were injured in the accident which took place on Delhi-Lucknow national highway. The gates of the crossing were open when the train passed through, taking everyone by surprise. According to sources, the Chandigarh-Lucknow special train (05012) was given signal while the railway crossing was open for vehicles which led to collision. The engine of the train was also damaged. A senior railway official said that a major accident was averted as the train was carrying hundreds of passengers. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has announced a compensation of Rs 2lakh for the kin of the deceased. The victims were identified as Sadaqat (42), his wife Gulafshan (35), son Hamza (2), Satendra Singh (38) and Prempal (60). Sadaqat, a local, was going to attend the funeral of his brother-in-law. He was riding a motorcycle with his wife and son on the pillion when the tragedy struck. Satendra was the driver of the truck which was blown into two pieces due to the impact of the speeding train. While Prempal, also a local, was answering nature’s call near the track when he was hit by some damaged parts of the truck. All of them died on the spot at 5:30am at Hulasnagla railway crossing. After getting the information, additional director general of police (ADG) Avinash Chandra, Shahjahanpur’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) S Anand and district magistrate Indra Vikram Singh rushed to the spot. The entire rail traffic between Shahjahanpur and Delhi was affected for nearly five hours. The DM said, “Lucknow-Chandigarh Express coming from the direction of Bareilly hit two trucks and a bike at a crossing in Katra. Five persons have died while one is critically injured. The crossing was open when the train passed and railway officials are finding if the signal failure was a reason behind the accident.” A senior railway official said that a team of officials are investigating the accident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/5-killed-as-express-train-hits-truck-bike-signal-failure-suspected-in-ups-shahjahanpur/articleshow/82202431.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Regional passport officer, Wren Mishra, in a statement said that in the last 20 days, 24 staffers and members of their families have tested positive. An assistant passport officer, Vijay Karat, died of Covid. “Considering the scale of cases, daily appointments at all Passport Seva Kendras and Post Office Passport Seva Kendras have been reduced by half. This will ensure social distancing by reducing number of applicants at centres.” He said that these are temporary measures and things will go back to normal once the situation improves. Mishra said that considering the possibility of infection, it is expected that applicants visit the main office and PSKs only when absolutely necessary. “If there is no urgency, the applicant can wait for some time. Applicants may reschedule appointments to other dates without any limitation,” said Mishra.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Dog parents find a solution to pet peeve in Covid times||NEW DELHI: Achal Gupta has been getting at least five calls daily for the past two weeks from people who are inquiring about dog boarding.  As Covid-19 cases hit the population of Delhi with unprecedented intensity, Covid-positive dog parents found themselves in a dilemma, not being able to cater to their dog’s daily needs or take the pet out for walks. Gupta and his wife are doing such distressed families a good turn. They currently take care of 17 dogs from beleaguered households. Boarding stations, like Gupta’s, provide a safe home to the animals, feed and groom them and care for them even for weeks if their owners are unable to. Gupta’s Jeffury’s Pet Store Spa and Resort in Mundka has the resources and infrastructure for 50 canines. “We have been getting enquiries not only from Delhi, but also from other cities. There have been times when relatives of isolated dog parents have informed us of their predicament,” said Gupta, some of whose family members themselves are infected by the coronavirus. “There were three occasions when we had to break into a house to get to the dogs.” Many owners, Gupta explained, don’t realise their pets need daily care until they are incapacitated. At Kuldeep Chauhan’s Pet Lover’s Hut in Junapur village in south Delhi, guest dogs have an ample 18,000 sq feet of space to romp around in. “Relatives of Covid patients drop the dogs at the gate and we bathe the dog and give them new leashes before bringing them inside,” said Chauhan. “There is enough space here for them to run around and for us to accommodate their daily home routines.” Arun Shivakumar, a TCS employee, and his wife run Asha Arun’s Pet Home as a passion project from a three-acre farm where they live with their seven dogs and two horses. Shivakumar said, “We currently have 32 dogs for boarding. We get daily calls from families in which a member is Covid-positive. Initially, we refused such requests for boarding, but realised the pets needed to be cared for. So, we take all precautions and board the dogs.” At MSF Abode, recent graduate Ananya Kashyap said, “I get a lot of calls from dog parents, so I keep the dogs here for the period till they recover from Covid.” Since she does not have a lot of space, she takes one or two dogs at a time and tries to feed them food they are used to at their homes. “I have one that is here now for two months because her parents are not in town,” said Kashyap, who makes sure of her own safety by giving every dog a proper bath before admitting it to her small boarding station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dog-parents-find-a-solution-to-pet-peeve-in-covid-times/articleshow/82204221.cms||Mohammad Ibrar
---||Nagpur||Steroids saved you from Covid? Now save yourself from side effects||Nagpur: Many Covid-19 patients are recovering from moderate and severe level of the disease with the use of steroids. While there could be different views among doctors about prescribing steroids, many of them are giving these drugs to some patients who continue to be ill even in the second week of Covid-19 infection. Presently, steroids are proving life savers for many who have defeated the virus on the basis of these drugs. But, while celebrating victory over Covid-19, one must remember the known side-effects of steroids and also techniques to safeguard from those side-effects. Doctors told TOI that patients who recovered from Covid-19 with the help of steroids may suffer from avascular necrosis, some six months to 2 years down the line. Secondly fungal infections like Mucormycosis are aggressively spreading in such patients. “It’s a known fact that use of high-dose corticosteroids is a common cause of avascular necrosis. This necrosis occurs when blood flow to a bone is interrupted or reduced,” said orthopedic surgeon Dr Aashay Kekatpure. “Early diagnosis needs detailed clinical evaluation. The early changes in hip are seldom picked on X-ray, so MRI is considered the investigation modality of choice. Patients having history of diabetes, alcohol intake are more at risk of necrosis,” he said. According to him, recovered patients of Covid treated with steroids needs to be attentive to joint pains and aches. They should not avoid any symptoms like pain in center on the groin, thigh or buttocks. If neglected, it may cost a hip joint replacement surgery. Another ill-effect of the Covid-19 steroids is fungal infection of sinuses leading to Fungal Sinusitis caused by Mucormycosis which can be grave. “With headache, nose blockage, black discharge from nose, tooth pain, loose teeth, facial pain, heaviness and facial swelling being chief and initial symptoms of the sinusitis, one must not ignore this at any point of time in this colossal Covid crisis,” said Dr (Major) Vaibhav A Chandankhede, from ENT Department of IGGMCH. “It’s necessary to report early for an early diagnosis and evaluation to minimise and control the disease of this opportunistic co-infection. As it just can’t be delayed as neurological ailment or neglected for a usual headache. Treatment is both medical and surgical,” he added. TOI had reported on April 3 that mucormycosis cases are increasing in Nagpur since couple of months. They are accounting to 20 cases per 1,000 patients approximately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/steroids-saved-you-from-covid-now-save-yourself-from-side-effects/articleshow/82204210.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Kolkata||Housing complexes in Kolkata join hands with hospitals to run isolation units||KOLKATA: The bed crisis in hospitals has led to many fully-equipped isolation units being set up in common facilities like clubs, community halls and guest houses in housing complexes. Equipped with oxygen support and other basic medical facilities, the complexes are also tying up with hospitals for medical advice and support to run these units efficiently. Siddha Pines, a housing complex in Rajarhat, has tied up with Charnock hospital to put things in order after a Covid patient from the complex had a trying time getting a hospital bed. Though the patient was finally admitted to a government facility in Naihati, the experience served as a wakeup call and led to the decision to turn the complex guest house into a Covid isolation centre. “We have tied up with Charnock Hospital for medical support and advice. Trained nurses and attendants are being arranged,” said the housing association secretary Manav Mehera. At Greenwood Sonata, a complex in New Town, 400 families have contributed Rs 10,000-Rs 15,000 each to set up a five-bed facility with attendants, oxygen cylinders, PPE kits, a washing machine, refrigerator, TV and AC, said the complex president, Sudipta Mukherjee. At Udita off the EM Bypass, the residents’ association has stocked up on oxygen cylinders for use by residents if the need arises. “Last year, we were planning to make an isolation centre but had shelved the idea as the infection curve dropped. We are reviving it. A hospital tie-up is not a problem,” said D Nath, president of Udita. At South City, where oxygen cylinders have also been stocked, the complex club is likely to get converted into a Covid facility, said its association president, Manoj Gupta. Utalika, where 200 families live, has identified space and is taking advice from Medica Superspeciality Hospital to set up the facility. Neighbouring Urbana is also doing the same with empty apartments being utilised with owners’ permission. “I was unable to arrange a bed for my friend’s father as two hospitals told me that there are 12 and 10 patients waiting in ambulances and trolley,” said Snehendu Koner, a Covid research facilitator of a clinical research company that is into vaccine making.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/housing-complexes-join-hands-with-hosps-to-run-isolation-units/articleshow/82203362.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The decision to shut the tourist place, where many people flock to get a panoramic view of the Kanchenjunga was taken by the members of Charkhole Tourist Welfare Association. The decision came after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the country would be tackling then pandemic situation without hindering the livelihood of people. Khagen Tamang, a member of the association said: “Charkhole has been popular among tourists but we are worried over the safety of our villagers. That is why, we closed the place indefinitely to contain the spread of the virus.” However, other tourist destinations and hotels will stay open but a slew of safety measures will be followed. The district magistrate, R Vimala, said that the guidelines for hoteliers and drivers have already been circulated, laying a stress on three basic things like wearing masks, using hand sanitisers and maintaining physical distancing. “The areas where guests are received must have wash basins and a logbook will have to be maintained so that the visitors can be traced in case any one of them tests positive for Covid-19. The drivers have been asked to sanitise their vehicles properly,” said the DM. In hotels across Kalimpong, the occupancy of tourists has come down to 20% while there is no fresh booking as of now. Sanjay Pradhan, president of the Hotels and Restaurant Association of Kalimpong (HORAK) said the hotels are open and maintaining Covid protocols. “We have been advised by the DM to maintain the SOP as per the government norms. At present, there is no fresh booking from any tourist,” Pradhan added. Some popular tourist lodges had advance bookings for April-May, but later, the tourists cancelled the bookings, according to sources. “The tourists are cancelling their bookings themselves, so we don’t have to shut the hotels this time,” said a member of Delo tourist lodge. Locals are likely to take precautionary measures as they more conscious this time. “The situation is such that the government will take some time to decide on what should be done. But we think people will shut their areas, instead of the government imposing a lockdown,” said a Hills resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kalimpong-tourist-site-shuts-doors-to-visitors/articleshow/82203386.cms||---

While some are from grieving relatives trying to come to terms with their loss, many others could be seen looking for bodies of their loved ones. On Thursday, a woman was found crying in the hospital’s parking lot as her relatives consoled her. Her husband Pramod Sharma tested positive recently and was admitted to the hospital on Wednesday.

He added that they rushed to the hospital after the call. “But when we reached, we saw there was another patient in that bed. We got anxious and started looking for him. Later, we found his body on a stretcher in the corridor. A staffer told us, he passed away sometime back,” he added. Till late in the afternoon, the family members were found trying to complete the formalities at the hospital. A few families alleged that doctors and nurses are not checking on patients regularly. Sanjay Singh, whose mother Rajendri Devi was admitted on Wednesday, said no doctor or nurse has checked on her since then. “They are not looking after the patients. When a patient dies, they immediately remove the body to make space for another patient. Sometimes, the families are not getting information on time,” he said. A senior official at the hospital said that given the rush, they hardly have any other option. “Beds are limited and several people are in the queue. Every second counts. We have to remove bodies almost immediately to free up the beds. We have no other option,” he said. Meanwhile, a hospital staff could be overheard saying “we have two beds reserved for VIPs, so you can come and get your relative admitted”. The hospital has 118 Covid beds and according to officials all are occupied. “All beds are full here,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/family-finds-man-dead-on-stretcher-in-hosp-corridor/articleshow/82205241.cms||Abhijay Jha
---||Kolkata||New twist to auto death case: Driver killed man||Kolkata: An investigation by cops from Parnasree police station has revealed that the death of a 66-year-old man, which seemed to have been caused by an accident, was actually homicide. Cops have slapped charges of culpable homicide (Section 304 of IPC) on the accused, an autorickshaw driver. Ten days ago, on April 12, cops had recovered the body of Santi Ranjan Poddar, a garments supplier, around 60m from his Banamali Naskar Road home in Behala. He had left for Chittaranjan National Medical College the previous evening to get a catheter changed but had not returned thereafter. His wife Annapurna (54) had identified the body. The post-mortem report revealed the injuries on his body were consistent with accident trauma. After an unnatural death case was registered, cops began to scan CCTV footage to hunt for the offending vehicle. A breakthrough came in the probe when a rickshaw puller said that he had seen the victim argue with an autorickshaw driver that night. The auto was traced and the driver, Sanjay Manna, was brought in for questioning. During interrogation, Manna confessed that he was responsible for Poddar’s death. After alighting from the auto around 1.30am that night, Poddar had paid Rs 20, leading to an altercation over fare. Manna attempted to snatch the wallet containing Rs 400. When Poddar was trying to grab it back, Manna accelerated. Poddar managed to grab the iron bar next to the driver and hung on as Manna drove recklessly in a bid to throw him off. He then grazed past an electric pole which hit Poddar’s body and killed him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-twist-to-auto-death-case-driver-killed-man/articleshow/82203400.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Chandigarh||Let CIA probe drug cartel busted in Canada: Lalpura||Chandigarh: Former IPS officer and BJP’s national spokesperson Iqbal Singh Lalpura has said that the central intelligence agency (CIA) of the United States should probe the internation drug smuggling cartel busted in Canada which has 25 smugglers of Punjab origin and as huge supply of drugs is being routed through Punjab. “It is unfortunate that Punjab has turned into a state where drugs are peddled and a business of drug smuggling and trafficking is being run to supply heroine, opium and cocaine,” said Lalpura. He added that chief minister Amarinder Singh had taken an oath that when he becomes the chief minister, he would finish the drug trade in four weeks. He reminded Amarinder that it has been over four years since he took over the reigns in the state and the drug trade has only grown larger and flourished. The BJP leader said that on Wednesday, heroine worth Rs 31 crore was caught by Ferozepur police and suggested that the central government hand over the investigation of drug mafia in the state to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Lalpura said the nexus involved powerful people and needed to be investigated by an agency which could not be coerced or intimidated by the state players. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/let-cia-probe-drug-cartel-busted-in-canada-lalpura/articleshow/82204224.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

But for Mumbai’s policewomen, taking a break in the cool comforts of a vanity van after work was unthinkable until now. Six vanity vans have been provided by a vehicle dealer for police personnel deployed on bandobast duty in the sweltering heat. Each of the vans has separate sections for men and women and is fully air-conditioned. “We have put up nine check-points on Western Express Highway, between Dahisar and Goregaon, since the state government issued restrictions on movement to combat Covid. At each point, there are two officers and about 15 constables who work in shifts. As it gets too hot during the day, we have instructed our staff not to stand on the road for over 90 minutes at a stretch. They can take a break in the vanity van,” said additional police commissioner Dilip Sawant. The biggest problem for personnel on bandobast is the lack of washrooms. For women, it’s even tougher when they are menstruating. With malls and big retail stores shut, the police have nowhere to go if they want to use the washroom. There aren’t enough public toilets and the nearest police station is a kilometre or two away from the check-point. “In my interaction with women personnel, they admitted to drinking less water so they wouldn’t have to use the washroom. At that point, I decided to offer my vans for the police department,” said Ketan Rawal of Mumbadevi Vehicles that has provided all six vanity vans. Some of these vanity vans were diverted from film sets since shootings have been reduced in the wake of the pandemic. Each van has three sections with washrooms, a bed and dressing table. Police personnel can change or take a short nap between shifts. “Constables shouldn’t feel that their superiors are seated in air-conditioned offices while they slum it out on the road,” said a senior police officer. A young woman constable told TOI that she felt taken care of. Ordinarily, using the van would cost Rs 6,000 for 12 hours. For a big celebrity, the cost could escalate between Rs 8,000 and Rs 10,000. Rawal, on his part, said he does not intend to charge the police even if his business takes a slight hit.

---||Mumbai||Pfizer offers Covid-19 vaccine to govt at ‘not-for-profit’ price||Mumbai: US drug major Pfizer said it will offer its Covid-19 vaccine at a ‘not-for-profit’ price for the Indian government’s immunization programme. The company said it “continues to be in discussions” with the government, and remains “committed” to making the vaccine available for deployment in the country’s vaccination programme. The company is yet to reapply to the government for emergency authorisation for its vaccine, after withdrawing its application in February. Recently, the government decided to fast track approvals for foreign-produced Covid-19 vaccines authorised by global regulators, by doing away with bridging trial studies prior to regulatory approval. Vaccines approved by Western regulators including the USFDA, UK’s MHRA and WHO will be granted emergency authorisation here, with the company now conducting post-approval parallel bridging studies in place of local clinical trials. The company did not provide specific details about pricing for India. A company spokesperson said “In all our agreements, Pfizer has adopted a distinct pricing structure for high, middle, and low/lower-middle-income countries consistent with our commitment to work towards equitable and affordable access for our Covid-19 vaccine for people around the world’’. During the current pandemic, Pfizer says its priority would be to exclusively support governments through supply of its vaccine only to governments for their immunization programmes. “This would be our approach in India as well,” the statement said. The company did not respond to a query on whether it will enter into agreements with hospitals that are keen to import the vaccine. Media reports say Pfizer has priced the messenger RNA vaccine around $10 in South Africa. Globally, as per contracts, the minimum price for the vaccine is $6.75 per dose, while the maximum is understood to be $23.50 per dose, according to the Global Health Centre. It costs about $20 (around Rs 1,500) per jab in the US. “Pricing-information and terms and conditions of the agreement (e.g., timelines for delivery, liability arrangements) are not available for the vast majority of confirmed vaccine purchases. Not all agreements are being publicly reported in a timely fashion, and of those that are reported, they often lack basic information, such as the total number of vaccines being provided and their prices. This lack of transparency makes it challenging to draw firm conclusions about global access to Covid-19 vaccines,” the Global Health Centre says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pfizer-offers-covid-19-vaccine-to-govt-at-not-for-profit-price/articleshow/82205326.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

---||Kozhikode||Kerala: Private hospitals seek clarity on vaccine procurement||KOCHI: Kerala, which has been leading amongst populous states in its Covid vaccination drive with almost 16% of its population receiving at least one dose, may suffer a setback from May 1, as private hospital managements have no clarity on vaccine supplies or prices right now. Under the Centre’s new policy, private hospitals will have to buy vaccines directly from the manufacturers but at a price the companies choose to set. Till now, the vaccines were routed through the Centre which it had been procuring at a mandated price of Rs 150 per dose. Hence, private hospital management associations have sought more clarity from the state government on what should be done to ensure vaccine supply and continuing the public immunization drive without any hitches. With CM Pinarayi Vijayan reiterating that the state would provide Covid-19 vaccines free to all, the question they raise is whether the government will procure vaccines for private hospitals as well or they need to procure them directly from the manufacturers. “We are waiting for more clarity from the state government. Already, we are facing a shortage of vaccines. At present, we don't know whether the state government will procure the vaccines for us or we need to procure them directly from the companies. The government needs to immediately call a meeting of all stakeholders to bring in clarity," said Dr M I Sahadulla, chairman and managing director, KIMS Healthcare Group and president, Association of Healthcare Providers India (Kerala chapter). Incidentally, in the initial days of the vaccination drive, not many were going to private hospitals. But as Covid cases started to surge and the government increased its awareness campaign, even private hospitals began to see a rush. "We have taken a wait-and-watch approach since we don't know about the state government’s plans. We don't want a situation where different hospitals charge different rates for the jab," said Kerala Private Hospital Association (KPHA) secretary Dr Benevan Joseph. What is clear is that from May 1, as per the Central government's order, the private hospitals, which were charging Rs 250 per dose (Rs 150 for the vaccine and Rs 100 as administration charge), will not be able to do so any longer. “The present dispensation where private Covid vaccination centres receive doses from the government and can charge up to Rs 250 per dose will cease to exist,” said the policy document for phase 3 inoculation drive issued by the Centre. Under the new policy, half the output of domestic manufacturers will go to the Centre while the rest will be sold to state governments and private hospitals at a pre-declared price. Indian Medical Association (Kerala), said the state government has the option of allowing private hospitals to continue serving as its free-vaccination centres. "This will ensure a faster vaccination drive as people can choose for free vaccination provided by the government at a private hospital or pay for the jab. The state government must immediately call a state-level meeting of distributors and manufacturers and give necessary directions," said Dr Jayakrishnan AV, chairman, Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) committee for vaccination promotion and coordination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/pvt-hospitals-seek-clarity-on-vaccine-procurement/articleshow/82207013.cms||Preetu Nair

According to medical superintendent of Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the infectivity has come down owing to which the positivity rate has reduced.“The state government has introduced severe restrictions that are being implemented strictly by the civic, district and police administration. As a result, crowding of people in market and public places have completely reduced,” Nagargoje said. “This has helped curb the rate at which people are getting infected. This is the reason the positivity rate has reduced to 25% during the last few days. Although the positivity rate has reduced, we are conducting the same number of tests that were being conducted earlier. Around 9,000 Covid tests are being conducted per day in civic and private hospitals across the city,” he added.Out of the 9,000 tests, 5,500 are being conducted by the civic body while the remaining is being done by the private hospitals. In September last year, the city had witnessed a spike in new Covid-19 cases, registering an average of 867 new cases every day. At this time, the positivity rate was around 40%.However, by the first week of February this year, the average per day cases were reduced to 99 and the positivity rate was also reduced to 10%.The cases once again started increasing from the second week of February and by March an average of 1,087 cases were being reported daily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-city-reports-10-dip-in-covid-19-positivity-rate/articleshow/82296560.cms||Tushar Pawar

Holding a review meeting with the officials at his Tadepalli camp office, the chief minister wanted the senior officials to review the progress of the survey on weekly-basis. He wanted the officials to ensure the presence of the farmers or the owners of the lands when the survey is done. He also directed them to take up jungle clearance to help the farmers and finally install the survey stones, fixing boundaries. The chief minister also cautioned the officials against resorting to any sort of corruption in the entire process of survey and issuance of the YSR Jagananna Saswatha Bhoomi Hakku-Bhoomi Rakshana card to the farmers. He said there should be no delay in the supply of stones as the land survey will be completed soon and added that no money should be collected from farmers for setting up boundary stones. He said one hoarding should be placed in every village and ward secretariat with details of government schemes and programmes and permanent hoardings be set up in important junctions. The chief minister directed the officials to open sub-registrar offices at the village and ward secretariats, where the land transactions are to be done henceforth. The officials informed the chief minister that SOP (Standard Ownership Policy) has been prepared for comprehensive land survey of 17,460 villages and 47,861 habitations in an area of 1.26 lakh km across the state. They said the survey is being conducted in 13 villages, per village in each district, and then in 51 villages, with one village in each division, and 650 villages with one village in each mandal in the first phase.

Besides looting cash from the branch, they snatched away a 12-bore rifle from the bank guard on duty. A senior police officer said three gunmen wearing PPE kits de-boarded a car, entered the J&K Bank branch and decamped with the cash in the afternoon. Locals present at the scene tried to catch them but the gunmen fired some shots in the air to create panic before running away from the spot, leaving behind their car, the officer said. After being informed about the crime, a police team reached the spot and an alert was sounded to nab the culprits, the officer added. Meanwhile, registration for the annual Amarnath Yatra has been temporarily deferred.

On Tuesday, around 49,500 people were vaccinated, while on Wednesday, over 53 thousand people got the jab. Before the weekend curfew of last week, 90,000 to 100,000 people were getting the jab every day. City residents can get vaccinated at over 500 sites in the capital — many of which are functional 24x7 — but the number of visitors started trickling down since the weekend curfew and has not picked up since. According to the official bulletin, 49,461 people got the jab on Tuesday, with 34,627 people getting the first dose and 14,834 people being fully vaccinated. On Wednesday, 53673 people got the jab, including 38,555 who received the first dose and 15118 getting their second one. Any eligible person can can vaccinated during the lockdown with an e-pass. However, many said they did not want the trouble of applying for it. “My friend runs a factory, which is engaged in production of essential products in Narela. He applied for an e-pass, but even after several days he has not received one. I got discouraged by his experience and did not try to apply for one to get vaccinated,” said Piyush Bharadwaj, a businessman. It’s not just the trouble of acquiring an e-pass that has people skipping the vaccine lines. Devinder Jain, general secretary of the Federation of All India Vyapar Mandal, said that many fully vaccinated people getting infected has discouraged people from taking the risk of stepping out. “The government should provide free priority treatment to all such individuals who have got infected even after full vaccination. It will encourage many to get the jab,” Jain said. A health department government official said that most people want to remain indoors and do not want to go out until its very urgent because Delhi is reporting around 25,000 or more cases every day and the positivity rate is above 30%. So far, a total of 27,76,631 people have been vaccinated in the capital, out of an estimated 2 crore population. Among them, 22,67408 people have received just the first dose and 5,09,223 are fully vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vax-drive-lags-as-fear-of-infection-keeps-many-away/articleshow/82203439.cms||AlokKNMishra

On April 15 last year this waste increased to 3.13 tonnes for the day. But now, on April 15 this year, the day’s total Covid waste generated in the state was 32.4 tonnes. This was approximately 10 times the waste that was generated last year according to senior officials of the Gujarat pollution control board! The waste primarily consisted of PPE kits used by doctors at hospitals and by paramedics involved in testing and sampling of cluttered localities. Ahmedabad today accounts for, on average, more than 65% of the total Covid waste generated in the state, according to GPCB officials. The state has 20 biowaste incineration facilities. “Gujarat today. has the highest number of biohazard waste incineration facilities in the country, 20 in one state. Right now we have only reached nearly 28% to 30% of the waste incineration capacity as a large quantity of waste from district and taluka public health centres have increased,” said a senior GPCB official. Apart from contaminated PPE waste, glassware, waste sharps, metals and other solid waste are also destroyed at the 20-odd facilities in the state. Incineration of hazardous biomedical waste is a meticulous process. “Incinerators are not designed to burn food waste of Covid patients, and the large number of plastic PPE kits which have high calorific value. The combustion chambers require frequent refurbishment,” said a senior GPCB official. Apart from this, air filters at these incineration plants require frequent replacement because of these high calorific value waste.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/daily-biomedical-waste-jumps-10-fold-in-a-yr/articleshow/82203427.cms||---

A batch of petitions have been filed by the power generating companies having Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with the discoms. Renewable energy generating companies filed appeal petitions challenging the single judge order over renegotiation of power tariffs by the Electricity Regulatory Commission and the interim payment arrangement. They have contended that the state government did not clear the dues even after the directions from the high court. Arguing on behalf of one of the companies, senior counsel Sanjay Sen said that though the discoms paid part payment of the dues, there were unexplained deductions. He said that the payments are being made according to interim arrangement made by the high court that are essential for the companies to keep their operations running. Deducting the amount from the agreed tariff which is only half of the actual tariff is not acceptable, he said. B P Patil, senior counsel, said the discoms are paying Rs 2.44 per unit as against Rs 4.85 according to the PPA. This payment has to be made in full without any deductions as it was mandated by the high court. He said that though the state government claimed that it has cleared the dues till December 2020, if the actual payments are taken into consideration, there are about Rs 1,500 crore pending dues. Arguing on behalf of the discoms and the state government, advocate general S Sriram told the high court bench comprising Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice C Praveen Kumar that the state government is liable to pay the dues at Rs 2.44 only and the same is being done in different tranches. He said only the payments pertaining to last quarter of FY 2020-21 is pending and efforts are being made to clear that by the end of May 2021. When it comes to deductions, he said that he will file a detailed affidavit stating the reasons for deductions if any, in individual cases. Allowing his request for filing an additional affidavit, the HC posted the matter for further hearing in last week of June and asked the AG to explain the reasons for deductions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/power-firms-challenge-discoms-in-hc/articleshow/82202512.cms||Srikanth Aluri

---||Chandigarh||Decide prosecution sanction of ETOs in 30 days, FCT told||CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief vigilance commissioner Justice Mehtab Singh Gill (retd.) has asked the state’s financial commissioner taxation (FCT) A Venu Prasad to decide the pending issue of prosecution sanction of excise and taxation officials in last year’s multi-crore Goods and Service Tax (GST) scam ‘positively’ within 30 days. Some of the accused officials in the scam include excise and taxation officers (ETOs) Lakhbir Singh, Kali Charan and Abhishek Duggal. The Punjab and Haryana high court had released them on regular bail on March 31 after taking note of the fact that sanction to prosecute them under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2018, had not been obtained so far and they were in custody since the registration of the FIR on August 21, 2020, and some of them since June 2020 itself. During investigation, it had come to fore that a number of officials of the excise and taxation department were receiving monthly bribes from transporters and businessmen for allowing them to ferry goods in and out of Punjab without paying the GST. One of the officials allegedly involved in the scam is joint director B K Virdi whose house was raided by Punjab vigilance bureau on Thursday. This case is a classic example of such cases where the sanctioning authorities, who are duty bound to either sanction or refuse prosecution sanction by passing a speaking order, keep on sitting on the file and let cases collapse in courts for want of prosecution sanction. The chief vigilance commissioner also reminded Prasad that according to Section 19 of The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, amended in 2018, the decision on prosecution sanction must be conveyed by the competent authority within three months. Justice Gill said according to the law, this responsibility lies with the office of the financial commissioner taxation being the competent authority. “Though the accused have been granted bail because the necessary sanction of prosecution has not been given, the cases are pending in the trial courts as well for want of the prosecution sanction,” said the chief vigilance commissioner in a letter addressed to Prasad. He also made it clear that “if these cases collapse at the stage of framing of charges in the trial court, the vigilance bureau will not be responsible”. The FIR in the case was registered under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, for forgery, criminal conspiracy and various other sections of the Indian Penal Code at police station, vigilance bureau, flying squad-1 at Mohali on August 21 last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/decide-prosecution-sanction-of-etos-in-30-days-fct-told/articleshow/82204238.cms||Sanjeev Verma

He was taken to a private hospital in the city on Wednesday. On Thursday, Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ) approached the Supreme Court for urgent hearing of his bail application along with a request to move the Delhi-based journalist to AIIMS or Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi. Kappan and three others were arrested on October 5 last year when they were going to a Hathras village from Delhi to report the alleged gang-rape and murder of a Dalit girl. Later they were accused of trying to foment disturbance and booked for sedition and under Sections of the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Jail officials said Kappan was admitted to a private medical college in Mathura after he tested positive for the virus. They added that he was in "serious condition". In the plea, KUWJ said that Kappan is a diabetic and has been suffering from high BP and cholesterol for more than 15 years now. “His health has been deteriorating as he is not getting proper food,” the plea said, adding that his life was in danger. The petition in the Supreme Court also claimed that at least 50 inmates of the Mathura jail are suffering from the contagious disease. “It is reliably believed that more than 50 inmates of Mathura jail are suffering from Covid-19. There is scarcity of everything. Some inmates are even drinking water from the toilet. It is seriously affecting their health, and a major disaster is in the making,” the plea said. Senior superintendent of Mathura prison, Shailendra Maitrey, said, "Forty-six inmates have tested positive for Covid-19. Of these, two of them, including Kappan, are admitted to KM Medical college for treatment."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/journalist-tests-positive-plea-in-sc-to-shift-him-to-aiims/articleshow/82202518.cms||---

In the video, the son, who has Covid, is seen lying on the road outside the hospital gate while his mother waits by his side with a bag. Sources said the alleged incident took place late on Wednesday night. The video alleged that as the patient did not arrive at the hospital in a 108-ambulance, they were denied admission. Shardaben Hospital was recently designated a Covid hospital. TOI could not track down or speak to the patient or his family. Top sources in the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) confirmed that this incident had indeed occurred. “There is a protocol in place according to which patients who want admission at Shardaben Hospital must come through the 108 ambulance service only. Moreover, the patient did not have a Covid positive report. This was clearly communicated to the patient and his attendant and they were asked to come through the 108 ambulance service,” said the civic body source. “Shardaben Hospital doesn’t have a ward for suspected Covid patients. The patient was advised by the doctor on duty to go to Civil but he made a video and then left,” said a senior AMC official, in response to media queries. The civic authorities are not aware whether the patient sought admission later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/patient-sent-back-for-want-of-108-ambulance/articleshow/82203598.cms||---

Due to the change in weather conditions, the power consumption in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits is stable at 58 million units per day. While the Telangana State Southern Power Distribution Company Ltd (TSSPDCL) has denied of any load shedding activities, frequent power disruptions are causing immense hardship to the residents of Alkapur Township, KPHB, Khairtabad, Old City among others. In Anand Nagar Colony, Khairtabad, residents experience a power cut every third day. “Every other day, there is a loud sound in the transformer and the power goes off. Although the issue is addressed by the local power breakdown unit, we want a permanent solution,” said Ravi, a resident.  Residents rue that in the name of maintenance work and feeder interruptions, power supply in many areas is disrupted for as long as six hours every day. Many are also facing voltage fluctuations. “@TsspdclCorporat @KTRoffice @KTRTRS We, Alkapur township residents are facing fluctuations, power shutdowns very often. Our gadgets are getting damaged because of fluctuations and when tried to contact concerned officials, getting no response. Please look into the same asap,” tweeted Shankar Dev Vuligonda. Officials attributed the change in weather conditions over the past few days to the power cuts in a few areas. “There is no load shedding in the GHMC limits. Gusty wind or light rains lead to feeder breakdowns thereby resulting in power cuts in a few areas. Not just that, road work in a few areas by the roads and buildings department is also resulting in power disruptions,” said Srinivas Reddy, director (operations), TSSPDCL.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/frequent-power-cuts-hinder-wfh-affect-those-in-isolation/articleshow/82203435.cms||Preeti Biswas

The district magistrate (DM) has ordered an inquiry even as the hospital administration claimed that the patients' condition was already critical and they succumbed to the infection. Aligarh DM CB Singh has asked the sub-divisional magistrate to inquire into the deaths and submit a report within three days. He told TOI that further action will be taken on the basis of the report. According to officials, five patients — mainly in the age group of 50 — died within 24 hours. Allegations levelled by family members against the hospital administration will be probed thoroughly, an official said. One of the deceased patient’s son alleged that his mother was fine till 8 pm on Wednesday and suddenly he came to know that the hospital was short of oxygen. “We had arranged the cylinder and by the time we could reach the hospital, she died," he said, adding that he had given this to the DM in writing. SJD hospital’s Covid unit incharge Dr Sanjeev Sharma claimed that the deaths were not due to lack of oxygen. He said, “All these patients were admitted in a critical condition after being infected by Covid-19. Their lungs were not functioning and so they were on oxygen support.” He added that oxygen was available in the hospital. Aligarh city magistrate Vineet Kumar Singh said that they had received a call from the hospital around 9:43 pm and within 45 minutes, 40 cylinders were dropped at the hospital. He added, “Hospital usually informs us several hours before it runs out of stock.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/five-covid-patients-die-at-aligarh-private-hosp-dm-calls-for-inquiry/articleshow/82202526.cms||---

At the meeting with deputy CM Ajit Pawar, home minister Dilip Walse Patil, director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Pandey and chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, Thackeray directed them to ensure strict implementation of the curbs. “The police were asked to ensure there were enough cops on the roads since it serves as a deterrent, but they were told that rather than using force and getting into arguments with violators, penal action should be taken,” said an official. Thackeray said the restrictions will lead to economic losses, hence it was important to implement them properly else it would be futile. “We are keeping a close watch on the situation. If required, rules will be made more stringent in the coming days. The idea is to break the chain,” said public health minister Rajesh Tope.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-enforce-curbs-strictly-but-do-not-use-force-cm-tells-cops/articleshow/82205328.cms||Bhavika Jain

She died just when they reached the hospital. He made a heartbreaking sight as he waited for a rickshaw, with her body still in the wheelchair, there was no hearse available to take her back home to Vatva. Dipak, who is from UP, said his wife had a fever but they did not get her tested as her condition had seemingly improved. She suddenly developed a fever again on Wednesday, and her condition rapidly deteriorated. “I took her to a local doctor who checked her oxygen levels, it was around 50 per cent. He told us that this was an emergency and I should get her admitted to a hospital immediately,” said Dipak. As the 108 ambulance was taking too long, he put her in a rickshaw and was shunted from one municipal hospital to another. “They said they were all full and had no ICU beds available,” said Dipak. He finally told an autorickshaw driver to take them to Civil Hospital. There was a long queue but the doctors on duty at the triage area, set up to give care to patients in waiting ambulances and vehicles, checked her. “She was then declared dead. I tried to save her but could not get care in time,” said Dipak, stunned by her death right in front of him. People and hosptial staffers helped Dipak get an autorickshaw, to take him and his wife’s body back to their house, ahead of her final rites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/turned-away-by-three-hospitals-woman-dies-at-doorstep-of-the-fourth/articleshow/82203641.cms||Yogesh Chawda

---||Delhi||Delhi: Beds, oxygen in short supply, Covid toll hits single-day high of 306||NEW DELHI: Delhi recorded 306 Covid-19 deaths in 24 hours on Thursday, the highest since the pandemic began a year ago. It comes at a time when new cases continue to rise exponentially and there is an acute shortage of critical facilities. Hospitals say the death numbers may go up further if the availability of oxygen support, ICU and ventilator beds isn’t augmented fast. As of 11 pm on Thursday, there were only four ventilator beds available for Covid-19 patients across the city—one at AIIMS Trauma Centre and three at Base Hospital in Delhi Cantt. The number of vacant Covid ICU beds without a ventilator beds stood at 11, all of them at a private hospital for children. Meanwhile, the city reported 26,169 fresh cases from 72,208 tests. Of the total tests, only 48,346 were RT-PCR tests. The positivity was 36.24%, which is the highest till date and suggests widespread outbreak. The number of active cases has reached 91,618. Of them, 46,585 are in home isolation while the rest are under treatment at hospitals, Covid Health Centres and Covid Care Centres, officials said. “A complete lockdown, centralised coordination for admission of the critically-ill and immediate redressal of logistical problems being faced in the supply of oxygen and other critical care supplies are needed to reduce the number of deaths in the city,” Dr Sumit Ray, head of critical care at Holy Family hospital, said. He added that most hospitals were running to full capacity and if these steps weren’t taken it might get difficult to save lives. “We have expanded over ICU capacity by 40% by utilising all possible spaces,” Dr Ray said. Doctors say only 15% of Covid-19 patients require admission to hospitals. The rest, 85%, can be managed at home. “Many people are rushing to hospitals early, when the condition is stable, because they are not sure if they would be able to get proper and timely care once the situation deteriorates. This is also leading to overcrowding,” Dr Arun Gupta, president of Delhi Medical Council, said. He added that patients under home isolation should check their oxygen saturation at least once in six hours. “If oxygen saturation is staying about 94%, there is nothing to worry about. But if it is falling, then one should consult his or her physician to decide the next course of action,” said Dr Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/beds-o2-in-short-supply-covid-toll-hits-single-day-high-of-306/articleshow/82203450.cms||---

While the state government through a notification allowed all hospitals and nursing homes to start Covid facility without prior permission to solve the crisis for beds, there seem to be no takers because of the prevalent shortage. According to Rajkot medical association (RMA) Rajkot’s requirement was 120 tonnes per day which increased to 200 tonnes per day with rise in number of patients especially severe cases requiring oxygen support. The only facilities at Shapar and Metoda that provide industrial oxygen is facing queue of hospital staff since the morning. The collector office had deputed Mamlatdar with police force to handle law and order situation. A senior official from Rajkot Civil Hospital told TOI, “We get oxygen as per our requirement but only at the last moment when the tank is about to get empty. We are being pushed to the edge fearing loss of precious lives from want of oxygen if the trucks somehow get stuck in the traffic.”According to sources few private hospitals have shot a letter to collector stating that they have opened Covid facilities at his request and now patients are about to die from want of oxygen. The collector had earlier requested many private hospitals to start Covid facility to meet the requirement for more beds. RMA president, Dr Praful Kamani said, “We have been told that the situation will be solved in one day but currently hospitals are reluctant to admit new patients looking at the shortage of oxygen.” Dr Hiren Kothari, who runs a Covid hospital said, “I have to ask patients clearly about the oxygen shortage, because I am also dependant on oxygen supply. How can I take entire responsibility to provide all the services?” Congress leader Dr Hemang Vasavda said, “The situation is very grim, if anybody dies from want of oxygen, their angry relatives may ransack the hospital. Hence, many hospitals are asking the patients to arrange their own oxygen cylinders.” District collector Remya Mohan and nodal officer Rahul Gupta could not be contacted for their comments despite several attempts.Oxygen supply to Vapi hospitals deniedSurat: A group of doctors from eight hospitals of Vapi in Valsad district arrived at the Valsad district collector’s office on Thursday to make representation over lack of supply of oxygen cylinders. The doctors complained that they are not being allowed to receive supply by the district administration since they are not registered as Covid-19 hospital. “The district officers are not allowing oxygen suppliers to provide us cylinders as we are not registered as Covid-19 hospitals. The state government has announced on Wednesday that all hospitals and nursing homes can admit Covid-19 patients but local officials in Valsad are denying us,” said Dr Purshottam Patil of City Multispeciality Hospital, Vapi.Shortage of Covid medicine tooAccording to hospitals and medical stores, they are facing Covid medicine shortage too for the past two days. Remdesivir is being provided centrally under regulation by the district administration, where injections are out of stock. Owner of a medical store owner on Vidhyanagar road, Hiren Thanki said, “We are also facing shortage of febilflu. Doctors prescribe the drug for high load viral patients. We get only 50 percent of the orders we place.” Patients will be treated under the domesWith the queue of patients waiting for admission only growing longer outside the civil hospital, the hospital administration is creating a makeshift 200-bed facility under the dome in the ground itself to provide treatment to patients. Patients with mild symptoms will be sent for home isolation from the ground itself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/short-oxygen-drug-supply-keeps-hospitals-on-tenterhooks/articleshow/82202577.cms||---

---||Goa||Don’t wait for test results if you have symptoms, start medication: S M Bandekar||PANAJI: Dean of Goa Medical College (GMC) and in-charge of Covid hospitals in the state S M Bandekar on Thursday appealed to people not to take the second wave casually. He attributed the high mortalities to people delaying treatment. “This wave is different. It’s powerful. The infectivity is very high and the severity is very bad,” he said. He advised people who are symptomatic not to wait for their results from testing and go ahead with treatment prescribed immediately. “If you are symptomatic and your antigen test is negative you should treat yourself as a Covid case. The time has come to treat it as Covid. Don’t take full-fledged Covid treatment like Remdesivir but take the preventive medication that comes with the home isolation kit,” he said. “You can call our 104 helpline number or directly call doctors of health services, Dr Geeta Kakodkar (deputy director health services) and myself will help,” he said, when asked how people would know what protocols of treatment to follow. “We have seen people delay by 5-6 days and their CT severity score increases. You can pump tonnes of oxygen into the patient, but the lungs cannot take this kind of treatment at this stage. The lungs are already damaged. Please understand this and follow proper protocols of treatment,” he said. “What we are trying to say is that infectivity is at almost 34 per cent where every third case is positive. Considering these statistics and being intelligent people, if we have the slightest symptoms of fever and cough why wait for four to five days, start treatment immediately and you will get protection from cytokine storm and severity. This is the only solution left for us now,” he said. He highlighted the importance of following Covid appropriate behaviour during this second wave. “No matter how many lockdowns are imposed, they won’t be of any help until one follows Covid appropriate behaviour,” he said. There must be some moral responsibility from citizens, he said. “It’s my humble request to wear a mask and keep social distancing,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dont-wait-for-test-results-if-you-have-symptoms-start-meds-dean/articleshow/82204398.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Special court acquits Chhota Rajan in 1993 blasts accused’s murder case||MUMBAI: A special court on Thursday acquitted gangster Chhota Rajan and another accused, Jagannath Jaiswal, in the 2001 murder of Hanif Kadawala, a film producer and an accused in the 1993 blasts case. The duo was acquitted due to lack of evidence. Kadawala, who was accused of transporting weapons to Mumbai on the instructions of Tiger Memon, was killed on February 7, 2001, in his Bandra office by three men. Two other accused were acquitted earlier in a separate trial. This is among the over 70 cases that the CBI took over after Rajan was deported from Bali in 2015. The 62-year-old, lodged in Tihar jail, is serving life sentence for the 2011 murder of journalist J Dey. Soon after Kadawala’s murder in 2001, an FIR was registered at Bandra police station. Investigations uncovered the role of an organised crime syndicate. Hence, provisions of the stringent MCOC Act were invoked. A chargesheet was subsequently submitted against Jaiswal, Nitin Sawant and Ashok Kotian. In the chargesheet, Rajan, Guru Satam and Yusuf Kadari alias Bachkana were shown as wanted accused. Kadari was arrested. During trial, Jaiswal and Sawant jumped bail. The trial proceeded against Kotian and Kadari and they were acquitted in 2004. Jaiswal was arrested in May 2017 and Sawant was reported to be dead. The CBI submitted a chargesheet against Rajan in 2019 and the trial commenced. The investigating agency alleged that Rajan wanted to gain public sympathy and avenge the blasts. Last year, the court rejected a plea by Kadawala’s son, who wanted a relative to be tried as an accused in the case on the grounds that Kadari had told the victim’s family that the relative had given a contract for the murder. The motive was allegedly a property dispute. However, the court said though the murder took place in 2001, the family had not suspected involvement of the relative till 2017. “It is difficult to gather from the evidence placed by the prosecution under what circumstances the acquitted accused made statement to the son of deceased and his friend and what prompted him to give such a statement after a lapse of 16 years,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-spl-court-acquits-rajan-in-1993-blasts-accuseds-murder-case/articleshow/82204447.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Delhi||Covid-19: Testing count down by 42,000 in Delhi since April 11||NEW DELHI: Testing has reduced significantly in Delhi over the past few days even as the infection is surging. Doctors say this will adversely affect timely diagnosis, isolation and treatment of Covid-19 patients. “Testing, tracking and treating are the main pillars of Covid management,” said a doctor. Most patients, he said, are put on Covid-19 treatment based on symptoms because results take too long or the labs simply refuse home collection citing unavailability of staff. “It’s been seven days since I placed a test request. The lab claims unavailability of staff. I have tried two other labs, but they are also refusing to do the test,” said Anshu Verma, a resident of Malviya Nagar. Many people are getting CT scans and X-ray done for assessment of the infection spread in the absence of tests. On April 11, the Delhi health department said 1,14,288 Covid-19 tests had been carried out in 24 hours, the highest till date. Data shows the number has been declining since. According to Thursday’s health bulletin, 72,208 tests were conducted in the past 24 hours, a reduction of nearly 42,000. The number of RT-PCR tests, considered the gold standard for Covid testing, has also declined sharply — from 76,954 on April 11 to 48,436 on Thursday. “We have been running the labs twice, thrice the capacity. Our staff are exhausted and some have even contracted Covid-19,” the head of a prominent lab chain in central Delhi said. Many people are still getting tests done for travelling or just to confirm if the infection has subsided, he said. “We need to rationalise the prescription of Covid-19 tests in the current circumstances.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/testing-count-down-by-42k-since-april-11/articleshow/82203456.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal assembly elections: Slight dip in turnout as Covid plays on voters’ mind||KOLKATA: On a day the ever rising graph of Covid infections in the state almost touched the 12,000 mark with 2372 new infections in North 24 Parganas alone, Bengal recorded its lowest turnout at 79.1% among the six phases of the elections conducted so far. Poll officials and candidates blamed Covid-19 for the drop in voters’ turnout this time. With only 76.2% voter turnout at North 24 Parganas – the largest district in the state – Bhatpara, Barrackpore and Noapara clocked below 70% polling at 65%, 67% and 69.8% respectively. “This was bound to happen. Such is the state of Covid in our district and especially in our assembly that many people didn’t step out to vote. Also, several others have gone back to their villages in UP and Bihar to be with their family, who are also hit by Covid-19. That resulted in the low turnout,” said Pawan Singh, the sitting Bhatpara MLA and BJP candidate. In 2016, Bhatpara had registered 75.02% polling. Be it in the entire Barrackpore industrial zone, Bongaon, Nadia, North Dinajpur or East Burdwan, Covid had cast its shadow as majority of voters and candidates along with their supporters were found donning masks and maintaining some level of social distancing which were literally absent in the earlier phases of the election. Clad in a PPE and walking back slowly to the ambulance after casting his vote in the last hour on Thursday, Nadia- Karimpur’s BJP candidate Samarendranath Ghosh regretted for being negligent during his early days of poll campaigns and spending the last 10 days in home isolation with fever and breathing complications after being tested Covid positive. “During the start of April, the Covid numbers were not this high and so there was lack of social awareness. I guess we should have all been more careful,” Ghosh told TOI over phone while in isolation at his home. Two other candidates Krishnanagar South’s Ujjwal Biswas and Khardaha’s Kajal Sinha – both contesting on TMC tickets — were tested positive too. While Sinha missed his vote, being admitted at Beleghata ID Hospital, controversy erupted over Biswas casting his vote without a PPE and in presence of polling officials, who too were without the protective dress – a must-have as per the EC guidelines concerning Covid patients. “I was tested positive a week ago but I don’t have any symptoms. I even wore a mask and gloves,” said Biswas, while arguing in favour of his case. But apart from sporadic instances of violations from voters as well as political workers, Covid protocols were largely maintained. “When I reached the Naihati Mahendra School to cast my vote, I was surprised to find the queues were very well maintained and there were uniformed personnel checking temperatures, and providing sanitisers and gloves. Those who were without masks, were even stopped from entering the school gate by CRPF personnel and were asked to get a mask from home,” said Sarbani Bhattacharya, a homemaker in Naihati. — with inputs from Ashis Poddar in Nadia||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/slight-dip-in-turnout-as-cov-plays-on-voters-mind/articleshow/82203453.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Instead of charging the government fixed rate of Rs 8,000 for the vial, the hospital charged Rs 50,000, the patient claimed. The patient sent a message to the authorities following which district medical and health officer (DMHO) Dr G Sujatha asked district TB control officer KV Ravinder to enquire into the matter. A showcause notice was issued to the hospital after making a preliminary enquiry based on the complaint. “We will take stringent action against hospitals resorting to such malpractices. It will not be tolerated,” district collector K Shashanka said. He also advised the public to report the matter to officials immediately if hospitals were charging more from patients for Remdesivir. In view of the Covid-19 situation, the district administration has allowed all 20-bed hospitals to provide treatment for the patients. Meanwhile, the district administration on Thursday asked the public to contact the control room if they have any Covid-related issues.

He was taken to a private hospital in the city on Wednesday. On Thursday, Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ) approached the Supreme Court for urgent hearing of his bail application along with a request to move the Delhi-based journalist to AIIMS or Safdarjung hospital in Delhi. Kappan and three others were arrested on October 5 last year when they were going to a Hathras village from Delhi to report the alleged gang-rape and murder of the Dalit girl. Later they were accused of trying to foment disturbance and booked for sedition and under sections of the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Jail officials said Kappan was admitted to a private medical college in Mathura after he tested positive for Covid-19 and collapsed in the bathroom. They added that he was in "serious condition". In the plea, KUWJ said that Kappan is a diabetic and has been suffering from high BP and cholesterol for more than 15 years now. “His health has been deteriorating as he is not getting proper food,” the plea said, adding that his life was in danger. The petition in the Supreme Court also claimed that at least 50 inmates of the Mathura jail are suffering from the contagious disease. “It is reliably believed that more than 50 inmates of Mathura jail are suffering from Covid-19. There is scarcity of everything. Some inmates are even drinking water from the toilet. It is seriously affecting their health, and a major disaster is in the making,” the plea said. Senior superintendent of Mathura prison, Shailendra Maitrey, said, "Forty-six inmates have tested positive forCovid-19. Of these, two of them, including Kappan, are admitted to KM Medical college for treatment."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/kerala-journo-in-up-jail-for-6-months-covid-health-worsens-plea-in-sc-to-shift-him-to-aiims/articleshow/82202546.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The local crime branch (LCB) sleuths of Western Railway arrested two men from Canning, South 24 Parganas in WB after receving specific information about their location. The duo identified as Bijan Haldar and Ashok Sarkar had targeted Abhuji Thakore, an angadia firm employee, who was travelling in Saurashtra Mail with the valuables and cash. Thakore had collected gold ornaments, diamonds and cash worth Rs 4.65 crores from Mumbai and was on his way to Ahmedabad by train in a reserved coach. Thakore told police he slept off after the train passed Bharuch station. When he woke up near Mehmadabad, the bag full ornaments and cash was missing. Haldar stays in Mumbai and runs a bhel-pani puri stall near angadia firms for around two decades. “He was aware about angadia firm employees carrying cash and valuables worth crores. He made a plan to commit the theft and roped in Sarkar who works as a spot boy in movies. They had made a reservation in the same train as Thakore and were following him from Mumbai,” the police added. They stole the bag after Thakore dozed off and fled to their village in West Bengal.  A complaint was filed with the railway police following which the LCB and railway special operations group (SOG) teams began investigations in the case. Cops got information that the accused were from West Bengal and stayed in Canning, South 24 Parganas. A team left for West Bengal on April 16 and kept an eye on the houses where they stayed. Police said they sought transit remand of the two but the court gave them interim bail. “We have recovered the majority of the stolen valuables and cash from the accused” a railway police official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/bhel-puri-seller-spot-boy-caught-for-theft-on-train/articleshow/82202445.cms||---

Covid cases are rising in the locality particularly in the high-rises and housing complex spread over the locality. I don’t want to add to the trouble of residents. We have decided to drop mega rallies, gatherings, road shows and even street corners. I will reach out to households as far as possible,” the CPM candidate said. The CPM at Maniktala, instead, plans to bring out tableaux for campaign. “One or two persons will address residents while passing through the locality. They will also play recorded speeches of our leaders. In places where tableaux can’t enter, our activists will reach out in bicycles and conduct campaign using hand mikes,” Bagchi said. Bagchi blamed both the governments — the Centre and the state — for undermining the Covid challenge. “The BJP government has already withdrawn the insurance for health workers and also the special rations from the PM to the poor.

The live bed availability tracking link, launched by the Telangana health department on Wednesday, shows all 619 ICU beds with ventilators in Gandhi Hospital as occupied while officials said 400 vacant oxygen beds are “filling up fast”. “All 619 ICU beds with ventilators are occupied at present. With patients pouring in, vacant oxygen beds are also filling,” said Gandhi hospital superintendent Dr M Raja Rao. Doctors said critical patients, as a result, cannot be shifted to ICUs as they are already at maximum capacity. “There are patients who recover, and we are shifting them to oxygen beds. ICU beds become vacant when there are some deaths or when patients move to private hospitals. This is how we are adjusting at present,” Dr Rao added. While general beds are still available, officials said people usually don’t get admitted to general wards and prefer oxygen beds out of anxiety. Doctors said they were finding it difficult to admit patients with ventilator requirement and non-invasive ventilation since Wednesday evening. Some doctors working in the Covid-19 ward claimed that the mortuary at the hospital is also running out of space. “It is true that the mortuary has been running out of space for the past few days. It is also taking a lot of time to shift the bodies from the hospital when a patient dies, especially when the attendants are not available,” a doctor told TOI, on condition of anonymity. “The number of positive cases due to the virulent strain is also way more than what it was last year,” she added. However, the hospital superintendent denied claims of the hospital mortuary running out of space. “It is not true that the hospital mortuary has no space. This is only creating unnecessary panic among patients and their attendants,” the superintendent said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/icu-beds-at-gandhi-occupied-o2-beds-filling-fast/articleshow/82203532.cms||Moulika.KV

Speaking to reporters, the minister said that despite government giving permission to 1,200 hospitals for Covid-19 treatment, many are directing critical cases to Gandhi Hospital. Eatala said the directive to districts was to treat patients at their hospitals and refer them to Gandhi only if they are in need of extreme care. “Currently, 600 patients are being treated in oxygen beds. Patients should come to the hospital when symptoms get severe,” he said.He added that some private hospitals were trying to exploit patients and that such hospitals will not be spared. The minister dismissed reports claiming a shortage of testing kits and said the state has a capacity to conduct 30,000 RT-PCR tests daily. He said the Centre was insisting on increasing RT-PCR tests without providing the means to do so. He added that more beds will be made available at private medical colleges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/send-patients-to-gandhi-only-in-extreme-cases-min/articleshow/82203553.cms||---

In FY20, FYP had increased by 21% at Rs 2.58 crore as compared to Rs 2.14 lakh crore in FY19. CARE Ratings, in its sectoral analysis, pointed out that despite the manifold challenges in the current scenario, the life industry ended FY21 on a positive note. “The growth was driven by the private sector, which grew at a much faster pace compared to the public sector. The single premium policies have driven growth in FY21,” it said. It also pointed out that the pandemic has boosted the demand for protection plans, even as the market volatility continued to affect the demand for market-linked plans. LIC, which accounted for nearly 66% share of the total FYP secured by insurers, reported 3.48% growth in FYP for financial year 2021.

---||Hyderabad||Secunderabad: Local military authority shuts access to colonies, residents upset||SECUNDERABAD: The local military authority (LMA) on Thursday shut the main access at north side gate in Cantonment, which leads to Yapral and other residential colonies, citing a sharp surge in Covid-19 cases. Irked by this, residents complained that they are forced to take a detour of 3-4 km to reach the main road. Expressing anguish over the LMA denying access to them, a resident registered complaints on Twitter tagging defence minister Rajnath Singh, municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao and MAUD principal secretary Arvind Kumar. Another resident, on condition of anonymity, told TOI, “While the pandemic cases are rising, the LMA’s decision is meaningless. On-duty jawans are also denying the residents access to the entry gate.” TOI’s efforts to get a response from the defence PRO proved futile. Locals of Pension Lanes in Bowenpally staged a protest against the LMA’s decision to deny access to an educational institution, playground and a shrine in the area. Locals conveyed their problems to a team of officials, including president Cantonment Board Brigadier Abhijit Chandra and SCB chief executive officer B Ajith Reddy, who visited the area on April 21. Defence officials responded to a plea by Congress MP A Revanth Reddy and locals and gave an assurance to resolve the issue of access to the three places within two months. Meanwhile, residents who traverse between the north-eastern parts of Secunderabad and Hyderabad, are worried the LMA may shut more public places in coming days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lma-shuts-access-to-colonies-residents-upset/articleshow/82203787.cms||---

Some institutions have suspended all non-emergency facilities, while some have cut down on the number of days and the timings for students to visit campuses for essential work. There are some other institutions that have drawn up rosters in such a manner that the employees have minimum physical interaction among each other. Classes are being held online ever since the lockdown was imposed in March 2020. Though students don’t have to visit the campuses for academic purposes, they sometimes have to go there to collect their migration certificates, cancellation fees, to submit documents for fee waiver and to get marksheets attested. A higher education notification has allowed colleges and universities to function with 50% employees on the campuses but with so many staffers contracting the virus that the institutions do not want to take any chance. Calcutta University has announced that only departments that will remain functional are those that provide essential services. “We have decided to keep open only the departments providing emergency services, such as audit and accounts, controller of examinations, PhD, migration, transcript and registration with 50% attendance till further order,” said a CU official. Office staff at Scottish Church College are working on rotation so that essential services are not hindered. “Both current and former students are advised to visit the campus only on Mondays and Fridays between 11am and 2pm,” a notice by the college stated. “We do not want the emergency services for students to be hampered but we also have to protect our employees,” said the principal of a south Kolkata college. At Jadavpur University, all the heads of departments and section-in-charges have been requested to draw up their rosters, based on their individual section’s needs. Several departments had to be shut after senior staff members tested Covid positive. “We will continue to provide services but with skeletal staff,” said a JU official. At many colleges, professors had been holding online classes from campuses asthey were needed to attend meetings and take crucial decisions. But they have also been told to teach from home. “Two weeks ago, we told our teachers to return to online classes from home,” said Deepali Singhee, principal at J D Birla Institute||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/colleges-univs-draw-up-schedule-for-safe-delivery-of-student-docus/articleshow/82203469.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Kolkata||More candidates test Covid-positive||Kolkata: The list of politicians in Bengal getting infected by Covid-19 is getting longer, many of them being contestants in the ongoing West Bengal assembly elections. Trinamool Congress leader Madan Mitra was shifted to Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals on Thursday after the 66-year-old tested positive to the infection. Mitra, the TMC candidate from Kamarhati, was admitted to state-run SSKM Hospital on Wednesday with symptoms like breathing distress. He was taken to the private hospital after his test report confirmed the infection as SSKM does not have Covid care facility. Another Trinamool leader Sashi Panja, the party’s candidate from Shyampukur, too, has tested positive. Panja, however, is at home isolation. The constituency will go to polls on April 29. TMC candidate from Khardah, Kajal Sinha, who, too, is infected is undergoing treatment at the critical care unit at ID Hospital. Mamatabala Thakur, former TMC MLA from Bongaon, is also being treated for the infection at the same hospital. Health experts had been cautioning people to desist from gathering on the face of the second wave. But leaders across all political parties had been holding massive rallies in meeting for the ongoing elections. “Gatherings, large crowd are always super spreader events with a highly infectious virus around. This was bound to happen. Now we know the politicians who are infected. Imagine the count of nameless supporters who must have tested positive by now,” said a doctor in a government hospital. TMC candidate from Maniktala Sadhan Pande, too, was rushed to a private hospital after he complained of discomfort while breathing. Pande had taken the second dose of vaccine on Wednesday. But the consumer affairs minister was sent back home from the hospital. Sources said he has not tested positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/more-candidates-test-covid-positive/articleshow/82203468.cms||---

A policy which leads to such conclusion has to be viewed as arbitrary and unreasonable, for the elderly citizens are entitled to protection under Article 21 of the Constitution of India as much as the young and abled-bodied citizenry,” said a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni.

The travel restrictions under the “Break the chain” drive initiated by the state government will continue till May 1. Central Railway’s chief public relations officer Shivaj Sutar said, “We have decided to run services as per Sunday timetable as the number of passengers travelling will decrease considerably.” The authorities will be curtailing entry and exit gates and also disabling the issuance of tickets through automated ticket vending machines (ATVM),), as state government has permitted travel in local trains to only essential service workers. The essential service category includes employees of state government, Central government and local self government. Public sector bank staff will be allowed along with those in the medical profession. Passengers who are travelling for medical emergency will also be permitted to travel. Season tickets and journey tickets will only be issued essential category passengers defined by the state government during this period. Before start of second wave of the pandemic, CR used to carry 21 lakh passengers while WR ferried 17.5 lakh passengers per day. Also, the number of entry and exit points have been closed. A official said, “There will be limited entry/exit gates as we want to ensure that unauthorised passengers do not travel.” WR’s chief public relations officer Sumit Thakur said, “RPF will work in coordination with GRP to ensure and prevent any unauthorised access to the station.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cr-wr-to-cut-locals-by-20-allow-only-essential-workers-in-mumbai/articleshow/82205335.cms||---

Where last year the government has restricted entry, this year, during the ongoing second wave, the jeep operators have found that the number of people have dropped even without any curbs being imposed. “Business has got affected and at times even 30 jeeps find it difficult to get business. On Monday, we could operate only 30 jeeps and on Tuesday hardly 16 jeeps could manage to get tourists,” said Tribolo Souza, an executive member of the Dudhsagar Tourist Operators’ Association (DTOA). The four-tiered Dudhsagar waterfall is located deep within the Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary and was equally popular among both domestic and foreign tourists before the pandemic hit. “With the ongoing pandemic, no foreign tourists have visited the falls till now. Moreover, the number of domestic tourists visiting the falls is also not satisfactory,” Souza said. Additional principal chief conservator of forest (APCCF) Santosh Kumar said that they have not yet insisted on strict measures as tourists numbers are showing a decline with increasing cases. “However, our government is working on it and we are waiting for an advisory,” Kumar, who is also the chief wildlife warden of the state, told TOI. During the first wave of the pandemic, in early 2020, entry was restricted for the public from March 16 and March 31, 2020. Currently, 431 jeeps are registered with the state wildlife board to ferry passengers to the foot of the falls and 240 jeeps are allowed to ferry tourists to the falls per day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/footfalls-at-dudhsagar-decline-as-cases-rise-jeep-business-takes-hit/articleshow/82204432.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker

In his order, Justice Sandeep Sharma observed, “The petitioner has been rendered disqualified to be a member of legislative assembly and, in case conviction is not stayed, he would not be able to contest the elections, which are otherwise bound to be held within six months of the occurrence of the vacancy. Conclusion of appeal pending before appellate court may take some time, and in the event of an appeal being allowed and petitioner being acquitted, he cannot be compensated for the loss of the term as MLA, which may even end by the time the appeal concludes.” The HC stayed the “findings of conviction recorded by the trial court against the petitioner till the final adjudication of the appeal”. With these orders, the membership of Pradeep Chaudhary would be restored in Haryana state assembly. On January 14, a Nalagarh court had convicted him for rioting and sentenced him to three years in prison.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/conviction-stayed-mla-set-to-be-back-in-house/articleshow/82206593.cms||Ajay Sura

The team led by sub-inspector Sanjay Gaikwad arrested the suspect, Pratik Kamble, (29) from Budhwar Peth. The police swing into action based on a tip-off received by police constable Yogesh Jagtap. Police have also recovered a sharp weapon from the suspect. On April 18, sub-inspector Naresh Vadewale had gone to arrest Kamble and his accomplice, Kumar Bhagwat, for their alleged involvement in shifting the CCTV cameras in Mangalwar Peth. “To avoid the arrest, Kamble had attacked the officer with a sharp weapon, while Bhagwat had pelted brick on him,” Gaikwad said. “Vadewale had dodged the blow and nabbed Bhagwat. But Kamble had fled the scene,” Gaikwad further added. The duo had been bookedunder Sections 353, 332, 307, 504 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Kamble, who has 10 cases registered against him, was externed from the district for two years. “We have also filed a case of violating the externment order against him,” Kamble added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/criminal-in-bid-to-kill-police-nabbed/articleshow/82204442.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Over 1 lakh migrants expected to return to Uttarakhand||DEHRADUN: More than 1 lakh migrant workers from Uttarakhand working in different parts of the country are expected to come back to the hill state as the second wave of Covid-19 has led to lockdowns and weekend curfews in several states. In the last few days, people have returned to the state from states like Delhi, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh and more such workers are expected to come back to the Himalayan state in the next few days. State agriculture minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal said that the state CM recently held meetings with all 13 district magistrates over returning migrant workers. “In the meeting, it was decided that we will restart the online registration of the returnees on the Smart City portal. Their travel history and health status record will be maintained. Further, the district and health teams will communicate with them regarding any improvement or deterioration in health condition,” said the minister. He added that DMs have also been asked to ensure health facilities in district hospitals and other hospitals. Last year, around 3.5 lakh migrants had returned to the state during the coronavirus-induced lockdown. However, over 1 lakh migrant workers again went to other states after the Covid-19 situation improved, according to rough estimates. Former CM Trivendra Singh Rawat told TOI that projects like CM Swarozgar Yojana and CM Solar Swarozgar Yojana which were launched during his term in office had met with good response. “The beneficiaries of the CM Solar Yojana who live in the hills may start producing a collective of 187 Megawatt electricity from September this year. Besides, a high number of returnees had enrolled themselves under the CM Swarozgar Yojana, which aims to help the returnees set up their start-ups in the hills,” added the ex-CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/over-1-lakh-migrants-expected-to-come-back-to-uttarakhand/articleshow/82202567.cms||Kautilya Singh

Whether they were wearing masks? The answer doctors get on taking the behavioural history of Covid-19 patients: ‘Main mask sirf baat karne time nikalta hun’ (I only remove the mask when talking) and ‘hum party mein mask utar ke video banaye’ (we removed the mask for making a video during our party). The responses have left health experts stumped. Most patients currently undergoing treatment at city hospitals are the ones who have got infected a mere fortnight ago. “The situation we are witnessing now is a result of the exposure and behavioural trend 14 days ago. While mask compliance is improving slowly, about 10 to 14 days ago masks were not even seen on majority of people. In addition, a lot of people have not been cautious and have been attending parties and functions. This has led to direct exposed to a higher viral load. The current surge is primarily due to the irresponsible behaviour of people,” said Dr Kiran Madala, in-charge head of department of critical care at Nizamabad Medical College. People’s careless attitude has not only led to a rapid increase in cases, but has also brought in entire families and groups of friends to Covid wards. “The group of five which said ‘hum gale mein hath dalke ghumte’, are all admitted at our hospital,” said Dr Ehsan Ahmed Khan, superintendent Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/docs-taking-patient-history-get-taste-of-recklessness/articleshow/82203481.cms||Amrita Didyala

The high court directed the CID not to arrest Rao but allowed it to continue investigation of the case. Rao had moved high court seeking to quash the FIR registered by CID over allegations of morphing the video of the CM in a press conference at Tirupati. CID registered a case against him following a complaint from one Narayana Reddy, an advocate from Kurnool. It was alleged that Rao portrayed the CM in bad light with a video which is not original but a compilation of different videos of the CM. CID even served notices to Rao to appear for enquiry at Kurnool office but he did not turn up for the same. Arguing on behalf of Rao, senior counsel Dammalapati Srinivas said that the complainant has no locus standi in the case as he was not an aggrieved person. He also contended the sections under which the case was registered by saying none of the sections would apply even assuming that the alleged crime was committed by Rao. He said the case is politically motivated and an attempt to stifle dissenting voices and added that the FIR is liable to be quashed. Taking the arguments of Srinivas into consideration, Justice R Raghunandan Rao directed the CID not to take any coercive action like arresting Rao. However, he allowed the CID to continue with its investigation into the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-gives-partial-relief-to-uma-in-cid-case/articleshow/82202571.cms||Srikanth Aluri

At Purbasthali in East Burdwan, a polling official was replaced as during the mock poll process he was alleged to have chanted ‘Jai Sri Ram’ inside the booth. The Trinamool agent had objected to third polling official Saumyajit Bhattacharya’s conduct and EC quickly stepped in to remove the latter. Despite reports of bomb attacks in Barrackpore in which six people were injured and police firing at Bagda, the sixth phase of the ongoing elections in 43 seats and in four districts on Thursday was peaceful, claimed chief electoral officer Ariz Aftab. However, Ketugram in East Burdwan witnessed violence as BJP candidate Mathura Ghosh’s car was attacked and there was an incident of bomb attack close to Booth Number 100 which created tension. The EC asked for a report of the incident. There was also complaint against another polling officer of Chopra. Although he was replaced, officials said that the move was taken because he was sick. In Baduria, a polling officer also fell sick and had to be hospitalised. There were webcasts in 7466 booths as around 1.03 crore voters turned up. In Ashoknagar, TMC claimed two of their supporters were injured while BJP said their candidate was attacked, alleging the central force had opened fire.

Thackeray had a brief meeting with Poonawalla on Wednesday on the supply of Covishield to Maharashtra following the Centre’s decision to open up direct sales by vaccine manufacturers to states and private hospitals. Tope said the state has also begun talks with Bharat Biotech for Covaxin supplies. The state is reaching out to manufacturers to purchase stocks ahead of the vaccination drive for the 18-45 age group which will start from May 1. “CM and senior officials have reached out to Biotech Pharma and since they have not announced their rates for state governments, we are waiting for those. Once the rates are out we will be able to purchase from them," said Tope. He also indicated the state may consider giving the vaccine free to poorer sections. "People who can afford the vaccines, should pay for it. We will consider helping the poor who cannot afford it. The final decision on the cost and which section of society will get concessions will be decided by the cabinet," said Tope. Tope said he has brought to Thackeray’s notice the manner in which Assam government used the Assam Arogya Nidhi to buy 1 crore vaccines from Bharat Biotech.

---||Goa||Divers pull up 100kg of ‘ghost nets’ from Grande Island water||COLVA: Around two weeks ago, 35-years-old dive master Lavito Rodrigues, along with his assistants Aniket Shirodkar from Vasco, Jonathan Fernandes from Nuvem, 11-year-old Bogmalo resident Naman, who is undergoing first stage open season diving certification training, and boat driver Joaquim Fernandes pulled up 100 kg of abandoned fishing nets from the depth of the sea at Grand Island at Vasco. June 19, 2020, five Olive Ridley sea turtles entangled in a ‘ghost’ fishing net were rescued by fishermen at Benaulim and released back into the sea. Fishing gear is designed to catch and kill marine life and it continues to do so even long after fishermen or anglers who use it discard it into the water. The menace of ghost fishing nets, while not visible to the human eye, is one of epic proportion as tonnes of ghost nets and fishing gear are abandoned in oceans each year. These in turn result in massive harm to marine life including turtles, dolphins, whales and even diving shore birds. Rodrigues said since the past six years that he has been engaged with Goa Diving, he has been clearing the coral bay at Vasco. He is supported by scuba instructor Gary Lamare. “Ghost nets drift due to tidal currents. As they travel the vast seas, they continue to catch and kill marine life in the process and hence, the term ‘ghost nets’. Entanglement in ghost nets can lead to exhaustion, suffocation, starvation, amputations of limbs, and, eventually, the death of a marine life,” he said. As ghost nets drift in the sea, they collect residue and become heavy, eventually sinking to the seabed when they get entangled with rocks and coral reefs. Some also get buried in the seabed. As the nets drift, they collect plastic, which is then ingested by fish, also resulting in death. Lavito said his team dived to a depth of 14m to remove a sizeable net along with plastic bags and bottles and beverage cans. The entire operation was recorded via a GoPro video camera. The net was then handed over to a resident of Bogmalo who wrapped it around mango trees to save mangoes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/divers-pull-up-100kg-of-ghost-nets-from-grande-island-water/articleshow/82204441.cms||Nisser Dias

---||Goa||Part of Ponda sub-district hospital dedicated for Covid patients||PONDA: The state government has partially converted the Ponda sub-district hospital (SDH) as Covid hospital and had 14 admissions by Thursday evening. The government had announced on Sunday that the Ponda SDH could be converted as Covid hospital. The second floor of the SDH has been dedicated to the Covid patients and the remaining floors will continue as usual for general patients. First floor of the hospital has outpatient departments (OPDs). Meanwhile art and culture minister Govind Gaude has said if need arises, the OPDs from the SDH can be shifted to newly-constructed guest house of the animal husbandry and veterinary services (AHVS) near Goa Dairy at Curti, in outskirts of Ponda town. Gaude refuted the possibility of shifting the OPDs at Dilasa, the palliative care centre run by the Indian Medical Association Charitable Trust Ponda, at Farmagudi, located about 3km away from the SDH. Ponda MLA Ravi Naik said the guest house has more space than that at Dilasa and it would be at a central location for the people coming from nearby villages. Alleviating the fear that the infection could spread to other patients, medical superintendent of the hospital Dr Vikas Kuwelkar said that the Covid floor has a separate entry and a separate lift which other people would not be allowed to use. During the first wave, from August 11, 2020 to January 3, 2021, the Ponda SDH was converted into a full-fledged Covid hospital. It had largely affected patients from Ponda and nearby places who were in need of emergency aid, including victims of vehicle accidents. General patients were then moved to either to Dharbandora primary health centre, or to Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital at Bambolim to get an X-ray. Gaude said to avoid such problems, the government has decided to shift the OPDs at the AHVS guest house with all necessary equipment for diagnostics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/part-of-ponda-sub-district-hospital-dedicated-for-covid-patients/articleshow/82204445.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker
---||Hyderabad||Covid-19: Patients spending more time in hospital in second wave||HYDERABAD: An increase in average time of hospitalisation is being seen in the current wave of Covid-19 infections. While earlier moderate cases needed about seven to 10 days of hospitalisation, now it is taking up to 15 days, say experts. Experts point out that several mutations of the virus are to blame for it. “Infectivity has been particularly high during the second wave due to mutations to the virus, right from UK variant to Brazil variant and double mutations to the existing variant here. As a result we are seeing whole families getting infected and being hospitalised. With more severity, the time spent in ICU automatically goes up,” said Dr P Raghuram, public health expert and director Ushalakshmi Centre for Breast diseases. Dr Vijay Kumar Chennamshetty, consultant interventional pulmonologist, Apollo Hospitals, Jubilee Hills, also said, “The new strain with double mutant and triple mutant, is causing very intense inflammatory response and resulting in early deterioration of patients’ condition.” In addition, he said, “complacency is making them reach out to hospitals at a late stage, resulting in longer stays than expected.” Not just time spent in hospitals, but also time spent in intensive care units (ICUs) and on ventilators has increased as more patients land in advanced stage of the disease. With this, the issue of huge hospital bills has come back to haunt patients’ families. In one incident, a middle-aged patient who was admitted at a corporate hospital for just four hours had a bill of Rs 64,000. A complaint was lodged with the state health department. “The newer strains are also resulting in a lot of false negatives. Once the patient gets a negative, he or she starts taking things easy,” said Dr M Karuna, an expert on public health. The fact that younger patients experience symptoms very late is adding to the problem. Experts point out people below 40 years experience almost no symptoms even at oxygen saturation level of 80 and then suddenly deteriorate. In one such instance recorded at a private hospital, a 35-year-old patient who experienced breathlessness when the saturation fell to 78 was rushed to the hospital and succumbed within 24 hours due to extensive damage to the lungs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/patients-spending-more-time-in-hosp-in-second-wave/articleshow/82203473.cms||Amrita Didyala

Ponda PI Mohan Gaude said Amogh Naik, 32, along with his father-in-law Shivanand Rathore, 54, his brother-in-law Amardeep Rathore, 32, (both migrants) and his friends Swapnil Borkar, 29, and Sunny Naik, 30, all residing in Borim, had illegally trespassed into the house of Mayur Naik, 30, in the same village and assaulted him and his family members. After Mayur lodged a complaint, police arrested Amogh and Swapnil in the night and the other three on Wednesday, the police inspector said. Police said Amogh approached Mayur and his friends while they were playing cricket at Gadder-Tamshirem in Borim expressing his willingness to join them. After they let him play with them, Amogh soon had a petty quarrel with Mayur during the match. “However, Amogh did not give up the quarrel and criminally trespassed into Mayur’s house along with the four accused and assaulted Mayur’s family members,” the police officer said.

Even buses on Pune-Mumbai route are getting only 10% to 15% passengers. All inter-district buses will stop operations by the end of the week,” Sunil Salva, director, Neeta Travels said. “The restrictions have made travelling tougher, especially for those who go to nearby districts to work,” a senior MSRTC official told . Rajan Junawane, vice-president, Pune Bus Association, said that the 14-day home quarantine regulation was a big deterrent. Senior officials of the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) said that inter-district travel between Pune and Mumbai was being allowed for now. “No vehicle was stopped on Thursday,” Kamlakar Phand, general manager (toll), MSRDC, said.

The beginning of change of insensitive BJP government will start from Margao on Friday with the proud Madganvkars exercising their democratic right. Mapusa, Quepem, Sanguem and Mormugao will also send a clear signal to the bankrupt BJP government to start packing their bags,” Kamat said in a press note. He further assured the people of fully empowering all the municipalities as per 74th constitutional amendment once the Congress forms the government following the 2022 assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/final-pitch-kamat-promises-an-ultra-modern-margao/articleshow/82204450.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||MC finds 2,200 vendors, says Rs 2.02 crore disbursed||CHANDIGARH: The municipal corporation has identified over 2,200 registered street vendors of the city for PM Svanidhi Yojana and Rs 2.02 crore have been disbursed among them under the national scheme. MC is consistently liaising with the nationalised banks that have also been roped in under the scheme to provide loan to the vendors. To create interest among the street vendors, the MC has also announced a Rs 500 per month exemption in vending fee to the registered ones. Therefore, for a one-year loan, they will get an exemption of Rs 6,000 in their annual vending fee. Since the scheme was started last year by the Central government to financially help the registered street vendors during the Covid-19 pandemic, a joint secretary-level officer of the Centre has been constantly reviewing the status and discussing the progress with the officers concerned. Vendors are also being sensitised about the loan facility. Through this scheme, the MC is also doing socio-economic profiling of all the beneficiaries, so that their and their families’ data can be collected and later they can be involved in other Central schemes. “Since the loan amount was just Rs 10,000 initially, it was very difficult to convince the street vendors, but as we have their exact data and location, we camped at their vending sites to create awareness about the benefits. Teams of staff from the vendors’ cell and other field employees were sent to convince them and their forms were filled on the spot. MC then worked as a bridge between vendors and banks to facilitate the loan,” sources said. ‘We are liaising with banks’Vivek Trivedi, MC’s social development officer (SDO), said, “We are trying our best to convince registered street vendors and also liaising with the banks for early and timely disbursement of the loan. With this scheme, vendors can do their business in a better manner and with exemption in the vending fee, they will have to repay a very minimal amount.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-finds-2200-vendors-says-rs-2-02cr-disbursed/articleshow/82203490.cms||Deepak Yadav

Due to non-availability of high pressure oxygen, crucial machines, including Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and ventilators, remained non-operational at a majority of the private hospitals. Oxygen cylinders were used to provide temporary relief to patients. Several hospitals asked caretakers to take away the patient due to short supply of oxygen. Notices mentioning non-availability of oxygen were pasted outside several hospitals. Meanwhile, 16 metric tonnes of oxygen were supplied to Agra from Noida on Thursday. Out of this, six tonnes were supplied to SN Medical College and 10 tonnes to designated private Covid hospitals. According to the health department officials, the oxygen supply was less than the requirement. At least 50 metric tonnes of oxygen supply a day is needed at 34 designated Covid hospitals in the district, they said. A senior doctor at the SN Medical College said, “BiPAP, HFNC and ventilators cannot be operated using oxygen cylinders. These machines need high pressure supply of oxygen. The oxygen tank is almost empty. State authorities have been informed in this regard. These machines, crucial for treatment of critical patients, can stop working anytime.” Senior member of IMA, Agra unit, Dr Ravi Mohan Pachori said, “Following a surge in Covid-19 cases, the demand for medical oxygen has increased multiple times in the last one week. A majority of the hospitals involved in treatment of Covid-19 patients are suffering from shortage of oxygen supply. It will be difficult to save patients in critical condition without oxygen. Machines like BiPAP, HFNC and ventilators have stopped working at several hospitals. The situation is getting worse by the day.” District chief medical officer of Agra Dr RC Pandey said, “We are making all-out efforts to ensure hospitals do not suffer from short supply of oxygen. Supply has not stopped but is much less than the demand. District administration has ordered stopping of supply to industries so that hospitals get it. More than 10 teams are working to bridge the gap in demand and supply of oxygen.” Meanwhile, 546 fresh cases were reported in Agra district on Thursday. The number of active cases increased to 3,746, the highest so far. The health department reported death of five Covid-19 patients in the last 24 hours. The total number of deaths since March 2020 is 208 now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/lack-of-high-pressure-o2-stalls-bipap-hfnc-ventilators-at-pvt-covid-hosps-in-agra/articleshow/82202583.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Remdesivir helps but is no elixir, say experts||HYDERABAD: With Hyderabad and many parts of the country witnessing a mad rush for Remdesivir injections, health experts point out though, a good anti-viral drug, is not a life-saving medicine for Covid-19 patients. They, however, say remdesivir improves the health condition of Covid-19 patients if given at initial stages of infection. The World Health Organisation (WHO) had earlier declared that Remdesivir does not improve the overall outcome of Covid-19 treatment but suggested its restrictive use for patients admitted to hospitals. Several research studies also show that Remdesivir serves as an adjuvant (which improves immune response), but not a gold standard treatment for Covid-19. According to Dr Jatinder Kumar, group director, Paras Hospitals, New Delhi, remdesivir was earlier used in the treatment of SARS and MERS, which are caused by members of coronavirus family. “No doubt, Remdesivir is a good anti-viral medicine,” he said, cautioning that “it is not a life-saving drug”. “It serves as an adjuvant and thus improves the condition of patients in some cases. Since it does not cause any adverse reaction, Remdesivir is prescribed. But it does not mean that one should run after it,” Dr Jatinder told TOI. He said Covid-19 patients require anti-coagulants and steroids to prevent blood clots and fight inflammation. Dr K Subba Reddy, chief intensivist, Apollo Hospitals, said the timing of giving remdesivir was important. It might not be useful in later part of the disease or after the patient deteriorates. “Remdesivir, in our experience, reduces viral load when given early during the disease. Many patients, who have got it early, have been able to avoid prolonged hospitalisation and have not required oxygen or ventilator support,” he said. Stating that Remdesivir was not a gold standard treatment for Covid-19, Dr Gopi Krishna Yedlapati, consultant interventional pulmonologist, Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad, said the drug helps in some set of patients. One should not completely discourage it from treatment. As there are no significant life-threatening side effects with remdesivir and weighing the benefits over the risks it must be administered only under medical supervision. “As a pulmonologist involved in managing a high load of patients for Covid-19, I have seen a good response in patients treated with Remdesivir in moderate as well as severe disease patients, along with other supportive therapy,” he added. A WHO solidarity trial, the biggest Covid-19 study so far, reveals that none of the four drugs studied (Remdesivir is one of the drugs) showed “any measurable benefit in mortality or disease course”. A research study, published in ‘The New England Journal of Medicine’ shows remdesivir works to a certain extent in patients and its benefits cannot be overlooked. But the difference in the outcome of patients on remdesivir and those on placebo (who did not get Remdesivir) is not very big. Patients, who got remdesivir, recovered in 10 days on an average as against 15 days for patients, who did not get the drug. In all, 24.6% patients, who were on remdesivir, developed serious adverse events as against 31.6% of patients, who did not get remdesivir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/remdesivir-helps-but-is-no-elixir-say-experts/articleshow/82203487.cms||Syed Akbar

There are checkpoints everywhere in the city to control non-essential movement.”Travel companies told TOI that inter-district travel for work has received a big setback after the latest state government restrictions banning inter-district travel, except for essential reasons.Cab companies said work travel from Pune to districts such as Sangli, Kolhapur, Satara, Mumbai and Nashik has also been hampered with 100% bookings being deferred to a later date. They added that working professionals who travel to other districts for meetings and business are in a soup.Pravin Ambekar, director of Shivneri Car, said, “Big companies have factories out of Pune and employees often travel to other districts for work. Such visits have been affected, so have the sales and audit works of such companies. These businesses have 100 trips a month to other districts, which have now been postponed. At least 10 business trip bookings with us for Mumbai, Sangli, Kolhapur and Nashik were postponed on Thursday.”Though people travelling from other cities in Maharashtra to Mumbai airport for flight connections have been allowed, provided they have a boarding pass, enquiries and bookings for this sector have also dropped. Cab fares have surged on this route, said tour operators.Rajesh Singh, who manages sales in Maa Ambe Travels, Pune, said, “We have just 10-15 cab bookings from Pune to Mumbai airport during the next three to four days. But many travel firms have no bookings at all due to the citizens’ fear associated with the rise in Covid-19 cases and recent curbs. As travel firms are receiving just one-way bookings from Pune to Mumbai airport, without return passengers, fares on this route have also gone up significantly. The one-way charge from Pune to Mumbai airport in a small cab is now Rs3,500-Rs4,500 as against the usual Rs2,500.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/professionals-in-a-fix-over-inter-dist-travel-restrictions/articleshow/82204467.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Hyderabad||Covishield protects against double mutant, says Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology||HYDERABAD: A day after the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) announced that Covaxin fights the so-called double mutant, B.1.617, city-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) on Thursday said Covishield vaccine, too, protects people from the new mutant. The ‘double mutant’ is said to be responsible for the sudden spike in cases in Maharashtra and other parts of the country. Scientists earlier feared that this double mutant or B.1.617 may escape the immune system and thus, vaccines may not offer protection from this strain of novel coronavirus. However, studies by ICMR on Covaxin found that it offers protection from the new mutant. And now CCMB scientists say Covishield, too, has the potential to fight against the ‘double mutant’. India has Covaxin and Covishield under its vaccination programme and has given emergency use authorisation to Russian vaccine Sputnik V. The double mutant has emerged as a variant of concern (VoC) and it has spread outside the borders to the UK. “Covishield protects against B.1.617. Early results using in vitro neutralization assay show that both convalescent (prior infection) sera and Covishield vaccinated sera offer protection against the B.1.617 variant, aka double mutant,” said CCMB director Rakesh Kumar Mishra. He, however, added in his tweet that it is very5 preliminary but encouraging result. Double mutant is a misnomer as this variant carries not double or two mutation but as many as 15 mutations, say experts. It has been found in 60 to 70% cases in Maharashtra, but less than 5% cases in Telangana and AP. Another new mutant from Bengal, B.1.618, is under study. CCMB scientist Divya Tej Sowpati tweeted the latest research study gives “all the more reason to get vaccinated”. He said convalescent sera is from September 2020 and hence most likely of an infection of a variant, which is not B.1.617. He also said if anyone has access to Pfizer/Moderna vaccinated sera, they may get in touch with the CCMB team for testing neutralization potential against new variant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covishield-protects-against-double-mutant-says-ccmb/articleshow/82203498.cms||Syed Akbar

---||Kochi||Kerala: Project to rejuvenate six major city canals in troubled waters||KOCHI: The Rs 1,367 crore integrated urban regeneration and water transport system (IURWTS), a scheme mooted by the government for the rejuvenation of major canals in the city, is limping. Though the work on the project was scheduled to begin in September 2020, the project is yet to even get the necessary clearances. Moreover, now the Kerala coastal zone management authority (KCZMA) has sought a detailed technical discussion before giving coastal regulation zone (CRZ) approval for the project. “We have given reply to the queries sent by KCZMA. We expect that the agency will give its nod without much delay,” an official with KMRL, the nodal agency for the project said. The KCZMA has sought the details like total dredging quantity and master plan for the same, number of cross structures proposed in CRZ area, details of jetties and allied infrastructure, solid waste management plan, sewage treatment facility, etc. If the authorities fail to explain all these aspects, the project may not get CRZ clearance. The procedures for land acquisition are to be started. The project funded by KIIFB plans to rejuvenate six major canals in the city and to start navigation through these canals. “We have sent the requisition for acquiring land to the revenue authorities. More than 100 acres will have to be acquired for widening the six canals. The revenue department is yet to appoint a special officer for land acquisition,” sources said. The KMRL had sent a letter to the revenue department requesting to post a special officer for land acquisition more than two months ago. “Once we get the land, work can be started within three months,” an official associated with the project said. The plan is to widen, desilt and beautify Edapally, Chilavannoor, Thevara-Perandoor, Market, Thevara and Knothuruthy canals. As part of canal bank infrastructure development, roads along the banks of the canals will have to be restored or widened. There had been roads along either sides of these canals. But rampant encroachment either reduced the width of the roads or caused their disappearance. Besides the regeneration of the canals, the IURWTS envisages canal network for inland navigation, tourism and recreational purpose. Boat jetties, bridges and foot overbridges, etc. will have to be constructed. “We have floated tenders for the construction of five road bridges which don’t require land acquisition. We have identified land for one of the sewage treatment plants as well,” an official associated with the project said. Most of the houses, offices and shops along either side of these canals open their outlet of toilets to the canals. The original width of Thevara-Perandoor Canal is around 45m to 60m. But the maximum width of the canal has been reduced to less than 15m now. The same is the case with other five canals as well. The authorities plan to provide the canals a uniform width of at least 20m, with 18m navigation channel and one metre for sewage pipeline on either side. Eviction of encroachments so as to increase the canals’ width to 20m will be a herculean task. Unless there is political intervention, the eviction may be entangled in legal battles which may last for years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/project-to-rejuvenate-six-major-city-canals-in-troubled-waters/articleshow/82202590.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

Police have arrested Jagdish Solanki (20), an attendant in the Covid ward and Hitesh Mahida (18), a sweeper, after video of the former striking a deal for Rs 9,000 had gone viral on Tuesday. Detailing the modus operandi, police said Mahida used to look out for beds which got vacated as the patient occupying it died. He then alerted Solanki (20) who would be negotiating with relatives of needy patients outside the hospital. On getting the information about vacant bed, Solanki used to pass on details of the patient he had struck a deal with. Mahida then used to the case window and got the patient registered and the file made. The entry into Covid hospital is from Chaudhary High School ground at the backside. Mahida then got a stretcher and went to the trauma centre where the patient would be brought by Solanki. Mahida then took the patient on the stretcher to the bed that he had identified. If anyone questioned as to why the patient is being brought from trauma centre entry instead of the the actual entry, Mahida was prepared to tell that he had taken the patient for some tests there. “No one would doubt as Mahida would be in PPE kit and there was an official file made,” said crime branch officials. Crime branch inspector VK Gadhvi said “Mahida used to vacate the bed by shifting the dead body himself before the hospital team tasked with formalities of Covid victims arrived.” Mahida was even prepared to tell any one doubting that the admitted patient was his relative and the hospitalization was done on the request of senior doctors. Solanki had worked in Covid ward as attendant for one-and-a-half-yeas and left. He rejoined the ward before a month. Solanki had got Mahida the job as sweeper in the hospital as they both were from Jamnagar and knew each other.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/two-youngsters-fleeced-900-bed-covid-hospital/articleshow/82202608.cms||---

---||Goa||No disqualification when 2/3rd MLAs merge with a political party: Rajesh Patnekar||PANAJI: Goa legislative assembly speaker Rajesh Patnekar has held that when two-third of the members of the MGP Legislature Party joined BJP, the MLAs cannot be disqualified as they have merged with the political party as per the anti-defection law. While dismissing the disqualification petition filed against former MGP MLAs deputy chief minister Manohar ‘Babu’ Ajgaonkar and PWD minister Deepak Pauskar for joining BJP in 2019, the speaker observed, “In the present case, admittedly, two out of three members of the MGP Legislature Party decided/agreed to merge with the BJP. Two out of three constitute two-third. Consequently, merger as contemplated under the Xth Schedule is complete.” The speaker rejected the argument of the MGP party, which filed the case, that along with the decision of the two-third of the MLAs to merge, the political party should also decide to merge, inorder to constitute a valid merger. The disqualification petition was filed by MGP’s senior leader and former deputy chief minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar. The order states that the elected representatives express the will of the people as well as the party and the Constitution has given paramount importance to the decision of elected MLAs and their wisdom as regards the merger. “I find that once two-third of the MLAs decide to merge, there is nothing further that is required to be proved for the purpose of the Xth Schedule,” Patnekar stated. He added that due to the merger, the requirement of para 4 (2) of the Xth Schedule is fully met with and the MLAs, who are protected under the law, cannot be disqualified. Para 4 (2) of the Xth Schedule creates a legal fiction by providing that when two-third of MLAs belonging to a particular legislature party decide to merge with another party, the political party is deemed to have merged with other political party, the speaker noted. “It is clear that the deeming fiction of a merger under para 4 (2) of the Xth Schedule of the Constitution of India has to be given a complete effect and it should be deemed that there is a merger, as per the Xth Schedule, if two-third of the members of the legislature party decide to merge in another political party. This fiction has to be given complete effect and as stated in Balkjit Singh Bhullar’s case, I cannot go further in any of other aspects,” the speaker observed. While noting that the Xth Schedule of the Constitution also provides that the balance one-third members of the legislature party can continue to exist as an independent group, the speaker added that this also suggests that despite the merger under the Xth Schedule, the original political party can still continue along with the other members of the legislative party. “Accordingly, it does not matter that the remaining members of the original political party continue to claim that their party still continues,” Patnekar said. The speaker’s order stated that on basis of averment in the petition itself, it is clear that the petitioner does not dispute the position that two-third of MGP’s MLAs decided to merge with BJP. “I feel that the fiction in para 4 (2) of the Xth Schedule of Constitution of India stands proved on basis of admission of petitioner by petitioner itself. I therefore dismiss the disqualification petition,” the speaker observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-disqualification-when-2/3rd-mlas-merge-with-a-political-party-speaker/articleshow/82204468.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Goa||Our panel will deliver effective governance in Goa: Vijai Sardesai||PANAJI: Equating the ruling dispensation to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, Goa Forward Party president Vijai Sardesai on Thursday said that voters are the vaccine against the ongoing “political pandemic” caused by the BJP for which the first dose would be delivered during the municipal polls and the second, at the next assembly elections. Sardesai made a last ditch effort to convince the voters ahead of the Margao Municipal polls as he promised to create a “Future Ready” Fatorda. GFP has fielded a 13-member Fatorda Forward panel, which is contesting the elections in an alliance with opposition leader and Margao MLA Digambar Kamat’s panel. Sardesai said that the panel has a vision to “deliver determined leadership, consensus solutions and effective governance” as against the “arrogant style of leadership” of the BJP. GFP has also appealed to voters to follow all Covid-19 protocols while voting. “Time and again, we have raised the Covid-19 issue with the chief minister, but he and the BJP showed no interest, the people cannot rely on this government anymore and are left to fend for themselves,” Sardesai said. The Fatorda MLA and former deputy chief minister said that Goa can no longer afford to “keep the BJP in power” and that the elections are an opportunity to bring down the “anti-Goan BJP” government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/our-panel-will-deliver-effective-governance-vijai/articleshow/82204464.cms||---
---||Pune||Audit of oxygen supply systems at hospitals in PMC areas||Pics with Mandar Pune: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Thursday ordered audit of medical oxygen supply systems in hospitals across the civic areas. The audit will be carried out in private as well as municipal hospitals. The decision was taken following the oxygen tanker leak tragedy at a civic hospital in Nashik. “We want to make sure that no such tragedy occurs here. All due precautions should be taken for proper and safe supply of oxygen to hospitals. Hence, an audit should be carried out. Instructions regarding the same have been given to the civic administration,” said mayor Murlidhar Mohol. He said that audit should be carried out on the lines of fire audit. The report should be submitted to the civic body. According to PMC officials, the audit will be carried out to check the physical fitness of the system as well as the carrying capacity. The system contains main storage tanks, pipeline and oxygen cylinders. Flow metres, pressure indicators and valves are also other important components of the system. “The audit will check if any of the system components have been damaged or not. In case of any damage, repairs will be ordered, and the system kept out of use till it is in order. Notices to the hospital managements will be given accordingly. The audits will be carried out in association with the food and drug administration,” said a senior official. The officials added that the replacement of the required components, if any, will be ordered. A regular cleaning and maintenance of the system is a must for keeping it in good shape. The schedule for it should be followed, the audit will cross-verify if it has been followed or not. The civic body will form teams for this audit, even an option of roping in private agency will be explored. Hospitals can do this audit through a private agency and submit the report. As per the PMC data, nearly 3,000 small and big hospitals with oxygen supply system operate in civic areas. Most of them have storage systems on their premises. The oxygen is provided through pipelines. Many only have oxygen beds and use mobile supply system i.e. removable cylinders; which are refilled before using. Oxygen generators and concentrators are fitted in some. The civic officials said that the demand for oxygen has gone up drastically. The demand is nearly five times more compared to normal requirement. Around 350 tonnes of medical oxygen are consumed daily in Pune district, including around 220 tonnes in PMC areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/audit-of-oxygen-supply-systems-at-hospitals-in-pmc-areas/articleshow/82204481.cms||---

There are elections happening in five municipalities, but only chaos and fear is created here.” Amonkar and his group apprehended the two men in Baina who rushed into a house after they were spotted. They were carrying a list of voters and envelopes with money, Amonkar said, adding one of them was a supporter of Naik’s candidate. The two men were handed over to the flying squad along with the cash. Vasco police said that they have been asked to conduct an investigation into the case by the flying squad.

---||Goa||Elections to 5 municipal councils today, counting of votes on April 26 in Goa||PANAJI/VASCO: All eyes are on the silent voter as elections to five urban local bodies — Mapusa, Margao, Quepem, Sanguem and Mormugao — get under way on Friday. The polls, which are being held amid an exponential spike in Covid-19 infections in the state, will see over 1.8 lakh voters exercise their franchise. A total of 402 candidates are in the fray. Although the Goa state election commission (SEC) has made the necessary arrangements at polling booths, which include provision of hand sanitisers and ensuring social distancing, political observers pointed to the likelihood of a low voter turnout due the pandemic. “If people decide to stay at home, there is every possibility of all five municipalities recording a low voting percentage,” one said. As per a Supreme Court order, the SEC must complete the municipal poll process by April 30. Although the commission had in February announced elections to 11 municipalities on March 20, the date was moved to March 21 after the apex court stayed a high court order cancelling elections to five municipalities over anomalies in the reservation of wards. The high court had earlier set aside a notification on ward reservations. Later, on March 30, the SEC announced April 23 as the polling date for the municipalities of Mapusa, Margao, Quepem, Sanguem and Mormugao. With this, elections to most urban local bodies in the state will be complete, except for the Ponda and Sakhali municipal councils which are yet to complete their terms. Of the 402 candidates in the fray for Friday’s election, Mormugao tops the list with 136 candidates while Mapusa has 95, Margao 115, Quepem 62 and Sanguem 43. Votes will be counted on April 26. Even after Covid-19 cases in the state began rising, BJP and other political parties — including GFP — tirelessly campaigned in a bid to make their mark in the five municipalities. Three of the five councils are within constituencies represented by BJP MLAs, while Margao and Sanguem lie within the constituencies of opposition MLAs. The stakes are high in Margao as BJP has been trying hard to wrest control of the commercial capital’s municipality. The BJP-supported panel is pitted against the one floated by Congress’ Digambar Kamat and Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco, and GFP’s Vijai Sardesai. Apart from some independents, three panels will battle it out in Mapusa — the BJP-backed Mapusa Development Front, and the opposition’s Mapsekarancho Ekvott and Bodgeshwar Development Front. In Mormugao, the fight for the municipal council is among panels backed by BJP, Congress, NCP and a few independents. While BJP has fielded candidates in 24 wards, Congress has candidates only in nine wards of the Mormugao constituency. Just recently, BJP state president Sadanand Tanavade tried to broker peace among three of the party’s MLAs who were on the verge of asking chief minister Pramod Sawant to drop urban development minister and Mormugao MLA Milind Naik from the cabinet over the ward reservation debacle. Considering the importance of the polls, the chief minister himself has campaigned mainly in Mapusa, Margao and Mormugao. Tanavade expressed confidence of BJP sweeping the polls this time too. “It is crucial for BJP to keep the momentum going. Otherwise, the opposition will score brownie points,” a political observer said while referring to the recently concluded election to seven urban local bodies, six of which were won by BJP-backed panels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/elections-to-5-municipal-councils-today-counting-of-votes-on-april-26/articleshow/82204473.cms||---

The material was sent to the exam centres in advance and now the schools have a responsibility to keep this material in safe custody till the board exams for HSC are announced. Schools said they are shut as per government order and so safeguarding the material ensuring that mischievous elements in society do not take advantage of the situation. The secondary school certificate (SSC, Std X) exam was to begin from April 23, and the higher secondary certificate (HSC, Std XII) from April 29 earlier. The SSC exam was cancelled by the state government while the revised dates for HSC have not been announced by the government. There is a likelihood that the dates would be announced once the Covid-19 cases are on the decline and the situation improves. Till then, the exam material will have to be kept on hold. The school principal of a state board school in Bhor, Anand Dahiphale, said, “We have to ensure that the material is safe and untouched till the exams begin. Most of the school principals in our taluka are working out a possibility to keep this material in government machinery which could be the tehsil office of the police station because schools are shut and there is nobody to guard the premises.” Schools, especially government ones, do not have the resources or the furniture to keep such material. Many have no benches for students let alone class cupboards or a common room or a principal’s office where such material can be stored safely. In urban areas, schools have a safe where the material can be stored. Many schools invest in iron safes where they are kept till needed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ssc-hsc-exam-material-needs-protection/articleshow/82210857.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Addressing a press conference, he said that while the Centre is overseeing oxygen, Remdesivir and vaccine allocation, it should ensure state gets adequate supply from other states also. “Telangana now requires about 384 tonnes of oxygen daily and we are getting around 270 tonnes. Alternative supply should come from areas suggested by the Centre, but Tamil Nadu said it will not give one tonne of oxygen to Telangana,” he said. As per allocation, the state has to get 40 tonnes daily supply from Bellari, 84 tonnes from Kalinganagar (Odisha), 20 tonnes from Chennai, 35 tonnes from Sriperumbudur.” “Oxygen has to be brought in special vehicles which is problem. If there is dearth the onus will be on Centre,” he said. Rajender also highlighted that some people are trying to sell oxygen in the blackmarket, and that the government would be stringent with them. “There is no shortage in government hospitals,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tn-refusing-to-send-oxygen-to-t-eatala/articleshow/82203516.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Industry sources, part of a meeting held with senior state governments officials late on Wednesday, said the supplies of liquid oxygen are expected to reach in the next few days. Speaking to TOI, Preeti Meena, director, Drugs Control Administration (Telangana) confirmed that the state had roped in Odisha to meet its oxygen supplies. “Every day we are working on increasing our supplies. Now, we will be getting oxygen from Odisha also,” Meena said, adding that Telangana has been allocated 84 metric tonnes of oxygen by Government of India. “We will try and get the maximum,” she said. In its directive to Tamil Nadu, the Centre has asked it to divert 45 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen to AP and Telangana. “While our requirement now is of 380 metric tonnes, we are being able to supply only about 180 metric tonnes. But the government has assured that this gap will be filled in the next two-three days,” said Mohammed Mujeeb Khan, owner of a plant in Jalpally pegging demand for oxygen this year, at three times of what it was in 2020. “The flow of tankers, carrying liquid oxygen, has reduced to a trickle. Just about one of them is coming every week,” said an executive from a Nacharam refilling station. Social organisations say they are buying medical equipment at an exorbitant price. “I ordered 10 litre oxygen cylinders from a supplier in Mumbai today, each for Rs 25,000. The same cylinders were available for Rs 7,500 last year,” said Mohammed Shujatullah, Humanity First Foundation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-to-source-liquid-oxygen-from-odisha-to-meet-demand/articleshow/82203512.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

Several social media users noted that they were being forced to shift their family members and friends from one hospital to another in search of ICU beds with ventilator. Bhimesh a resident of Nirmal, who was desperately running from pillar to post to find an ICU bed for his father said, “We posted on Twitter for leads that would help us find an ICU bed in Hyderabad. Prior to that, I had to travel nearly 80 kms from Nirmal to RIMS (Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences) in Adilabad to find a hospital, where I can admit my father. His condition is still critical and we are still looking for an ICU bed in Hyderabad.” The state has crossed the grim mark of 5,567 new cases on Thursday. Meanwhile, another twitter user, Nagesh Ellendula @ellendulanagesh tagged municipal administration and urban development minister KT Rama Rao and wrote, “My uncle needs ventilation due to Covid-19. I see all hospitals in Hyderabad are full and running out of ventilators. Please help in getting ventilator for my uncle asap (sic).” Another Twitter user Gurleen Singh @GurleenRattha said, “Hi, there is an urgent requirement for ventilator bed in Hyderabad. Any leads will be really helpful.” The live bed availability tracking link, which was launched by the health department on Wednesday, showed that the ICU beds with ventilators in several government and private hospitals were already filled to capacity. “At present, even if you add the number of beds in both private and government hospitals, it is not as many as the number of people getting infected and critical. To avoid the situation from becoming worse, people should follow the Covid-19 safety protocol even if they are vaccinated. Secondly, it is important that you consult a doctor even if there are mild symptoms. This is important because every Covid-19 positive patient does not require admission, oxygen or remdesivir. There is a criterion under which people are admitted,” said Nikhil Mathur, group chief of medical services, Care Hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/social-media-aids-people-in-hospital-bed-hunt/articleshow/82203519.cms||Moulika.KV

---||Dehradun||No scarcity of oxygen yet, but patient load rising: Secretary||DEHRADUN: The state government on Thursday said that there is no scarcity of oxygen in Uttarakhand, but only the hospitals in Dehradun are full as the capital city is also witnessing a lot of patients from neighbouring states such as Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh. The city based government and private hospitals are ensuring proper availability of oxygen from respective vendors and strict checking of supply is being done in the medical institutions to ensure no Nashik-like oxygen leakage from tankers takes place here. Dr Pankaj Pandey, secretary, state government, on Thursday informed that 10,375 isolation beds are available in Uttarakhand out of which 9,388 are empty. He added that there are 3,781 beds with oxygen supply across the state out of which 1,973 are empty and there are 706 ICU beds here of which 301 beds are empty. “We have 573 ventilator beds of which 346 beds are empty. The panic situation is only in Dehradun because there is a very high number of Covid cases. This is also due to a large number of patients from neighbouring states like HP and UP,” Dr Pandey added. Commenting on the capacity of oxygen beds, Dr Pandey said that the state has extended full support to All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Rishikeh which has been requested to increase 80 oxygen beds in the institution. The chief minister has a meeting with Himalayan Jolly Grant and Shri Mahant Indiresh hospital, too. Jolly Grant hospital agreed to increase 150 oxygen beds while Coronation Hospital will also install oxygen in around 100 beds in its Covid ward in the days to come. “In private hospitals, the state has decided to provide them with oxygen cylinders and concentrators. We are also increasing 1,000 oxygen beds at Maharana Pratap Sports College which will be operational in a couple of days,” said Dr Pandey, adding that there will be around 1,500 additional oxygen beds in Dehradun by early next week. Talking to TOI, medical superintendent (MS) of Max hospital, Dr Rahul Prasad, said that the hospital uses liquid oxygen which is converted into medical oxygen in case of any need. “We have ample supply of oxygen and the process of supply in wards is being monitored electronically. We have a team that keeps a check on supply of oxygen round the clock,” said Dr Prasad. Similar words were echoed by Dr Sanjoy Das, deputy medical superintendent of Himalyan Jolly Grant hospital and even by the authorities of government's Doon Medical College which gets oxygen supply from a third party agency. At Mahant Indiresh hospital, too, 8 kg of oxygen supply takes place thrice a day, says PRO Bhupendra Raturi who added that teams are deployed at the hospital so that work is conducted on a roster basis and to maintain a strict vigil on issues such as leakages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/no-scarcity-of-oxygen-yet-but-too-many-patients-from-up-and-hp-says-state-secy/articleshow/82202635.cms||Ishita Mishra

Sensing rebel trouble, TRS, BJP and Congress have not announced their complete list of candidates till Thursday morning. As they failed to get the B -forms to contest as party official candidate, they would be considered as independent candidates.  Party sources said in GWMC, ministers Dayakar Rao and Satyavathi Rathod assured co-opted corporator and nominated posts within three to four months. TRS working president KT Rama Rao reportedly spoke to both Warangal and Khammam ministers to ensure that all rebel candidates withdraw from the elections. Sources in TRS said except one or two candidates in Warangal East, the rest agreed to obey the party’s decision. In Khammam, over 100 candidates filed their nominations on behalf of TRS and Congress, only 36 each from the two parties withdrew their nomination papers. Only 21 of 69 candidates, who filed their nominations as BJP candidates, stayed away from the elections. Meanwhile, defections from one party to other were still continuing in the urban local bodies. In Siddipet, as many as 100 TDP leaders joined TRS in the presence of minister Harish Rao on Thursday. Similarly, Congress minority cell state vice-president Waheed Khan too joined the pink party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rebels-trouble-parties-stay-in-fray/articleshow/82203526.cms||Koride Mahesh

Siddhant Totla, the 25-year-old medical practitioner who sustained injuries in the attack, told TOI, “The patient was not undergoing treatment at the hospital. Some local corporator had pressurised the hospital authorities to admit that patient.” Totla had gone to the hospital in Kondhwa early on Wednesday for a visit. “When I entered the hospital, a cardiac ambulance too entered the premises.I immediately went there to check the condition of the patient,” Totla said. “When the patient did not respond, I called the senior doctor and the ICU in-charge. They too checked the patient and confirmed that he was dead,” Totla said. Totla said the relatives, however, insisted on admitting the patient. “When we told them that the patient was dead, all of a sudden they began abusing me. Some of them attacked me with an iron rod. I am partially handicapped. I somehow managed to run and lock myself in a room at the hospital,” Totla said. The suspects then beat up the accountant, Imam Hullar. They also damaged the security cabin and pelted stones at the hospital door.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/20-assault-doc-staff-when-patient-declared-dead/articleshow/82204488.cms||Mihir Tanksale

On Thursday morning, a man was found hanging from the second Goshree Bridge and while the police and fire force were taking down the body around 10.30am, the woman, who was later identified as Briyona Mariyo of Pallippuram, reportedly jumped off the same bridge. Apart from the two deaths, the body of an unidentified man, suspected to be in his forties, washed ashore near DP World at Vallarpadam. Vijayan, 62, of Mulavukad, who was found hanging from the bridge, reportedly tested positive for coronavirus on Wednesday evening. “He tested positive and it was conveyed by the health authorities to his wife, who is an Asha worker. It is not clear whether he knew about the result as his mobile phone was in switched off mode. The family was on the lookout for him since Wednesday evening,” said a source. Meanwhile, sources said that passersby couldn’t stop the woman from jumping as the focus was on taking down the body of the person who was found hanging. However, in a rescue bid, a man had jumped after the woman. Fishermen who were there on a coracle pulled both of them out of the water. Though they were rushed to Ernakulam General Hospital, the woman’s life could not be saved. Police said they were checking if there were any missing cases registered in connection.

A final decision will be taken after consulting chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, said higher & technical education minister Uday Samant. The minister said the department should be declared an essential service for smooth processing of results. He said exams for 13 non-agricultural state universities will be held online due to Covid-19. As the Centre announced a vaccination drive for all above 18 from May 1, Samant said his department will consult the CM, health department and cabinet colleagues to initiate the drive for students to ensure the next academic session starts without delay. “There are around 37 lakh students, for whom the state can arrange vaccination at university level, to avoid crowding at vaccination centres,” said Samant. He mentioned this at a media interaction after meeting vice-chancellors online. He voiced concern over increasing Covid cases and said there will not be physical exams till restrictions are in place to Break the Chain. He added that many universities in Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur have started online exams. Amravati University VC Murlidhar Chandekar said all agreed that universities will have to take the initiative for vaccinations. For a smooth declaration of results, VCs demanded that the state include them as essential services. The state is also considering NSS and NCC volunteers for the vaccination programme from May 1.

---||Agra||In Agra, Rs 60,000 for an ICU bed, Rs 25,000 for regular one||AGRA: After trying his luck frantically at some 10 hospitals across the city, Harish Sharma was told there was indeed a hospital bed for his mother. But he would have to pay Rs 60,000 a day. “My mother had been unconscious after her blood oxygen level dipped. I had already taken her to so many hospitals that a lot of time had passed. When the private hospital asked for that kind of money, which I could not afford, I felt helpless,” Sharma said. “I called up the Covid control room for help but nothing was done. I was forced to take her home. She passed away on Thursday morning,” he added, waiting in line at the Tajganj crematorium. In pre-Covid times, top private hospitals of the city would charge no more than Rs 10,000 for an ICU bed per day. When Covid-19 struck, rates went up to Rs 20,000 a day at the pandemic’s peak. Now, amid escalating cases, ICU bed rates in private hospitals have shot up to a staggering Rs 60,000 a day. For a normal bed, hospitals are charging Rs 25,000 a day. The district Covid control room has been getting incessant calls from families seeking help in getting a bed they can afford. “I am constantly getting complaints about private hospitals charging exorbitant rates — up to Rs 60,000 for an ICU bed. Then, the Remdesivir injections are being sold at Rs 40,000. It is simply not possible for a majority of the patients in critical conditions to afford that,” Agra mayor Naveen Jain said. “I have taken this up with higher authorities. The district administration should take action against those taking advantage of a pandemic.” While some, like Sharma, are compelled to take patients home, others are scraping together their last financial reserves to afford treatment. “My father had high fever and difficulty in breathing on Sunday. I took him to four private hospitals for treatment. I was asked to deposit Rs 40,000-50,000 before admission. They would not take him in without that. I requested them to at least admit him while I put together the money, but they refused,” said Ramesh Agarwal, a resident of Bodla. “The next day, I managed to get Rs 1 lakh and got my father admitted. I was told he would need to be transferred to the ICU ward and that would cost Rs 40,000 a day, plus whatever the medicines cost. I could not afford to pay Rs 4 lakh for a 10-day treatment. A doctor we knew suggested that we take him and arrange for oxygen support at home. We have done that for now.” According to the health department, charges for Covid-19 have already been capped by the state government. Isolation beds, including supportive care and oxygen at National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers (NABH)-accredited hospitals in Tier A cities like Agra are supposed to cost not more than Rs 10,000 a day and those at non-accredited hospitals, Rs 8,000. For ICU without ventilator care, NABH-accredited hospitals can charge Rs 15,000 a day and non-accredited ones, Rs 13,000. With ventilator care, ICU beds can be charged at a maximum of Rs 18,000 a day in accredited hospitals and Rs 15,000 at non-accredited ones. All of this includes PPE costs. “We are getting complaints of overcharging during Covid-19 treatment by private hospitals. The state government has clearly determined charges. Any hospital found taking advantage of the crisis will face stringent action,” Agra district magistrate Prabhu N Singh said. “The health department is investigating complaints against a few hospitals. On the basis of that report, licences of hospitals engaged in malpractices will be suspended and an FIR will be registered against the management of these hospitals under The Epidemic Diseases Act.” (Names have been changed to protect medical history of Covid-19 patients)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/in-agra-rs-60k-for-an-icu-bed-rs-25k-for-regular-one/articleshow/82202628.cms||Deepak Lavania

---||Lucknow||‘Hammer out plan to tackle vaccination rush from May 1’||Lucknow: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said on Thursday that vaccination is the biggest weapon against the Covid-19 pandemic and therefore, all districts should have a proper plan in place to handle the rush of people as inoculation of all above the age of 18 years would start from May 1 onwards. In a Covid review meeting with divisional commissioners, district magistrates and senior police officials on Thursday evening, the CM noted that the positivity rate in Meerut, Gorakhpur, Jhansi, Bareilly, Jaunpur, Ballia and Ghazipur districts has been high and these districts are also witnessing the most traffic of migrant workers. He directed the officials of these districts to strengthen the monitoring committees and quarantine all the migrant people coming into the district from other states. The CM said the number of beds in Covid hospitals in these districts should also be increased. The chief minister said that the system of home quarantine needs to be further strengthened and therefore officials should ensure that patients in home isolation get all the medicines in time and they follow all laid down protocols strictly. The officials of Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar district administrations were especially directed to ensure that industrial activity continues as usual. Directing that action be taken against all those trying to spread fear and trigger panic among people, the CM said that those who spread rumours or hoard life-saving medicines should also be dealt with strictly. The CM said that those dying of Covid should be given a respectful funeral, while officials should have a sympathetic attitude towards their grieving relatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hammer-out-plan-to-tackle-vaccination-rush-from-may-1/articleshow/82204495.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana high court raps state for incomplete data on BCs||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Thursday found fault with the state government for failing to collect scientific data about the numbers and status of backward classes in the state and for rushing to conduct and complete the 2019 elections for panchayats, mandal parishads, and ZPs with incomplete data collected from irrelevant sources. The bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy gave a stern warning that the action of the state was liable to be nullified, but spared it of any adverse order because the elections were already over. The bench, however, made it clear to the state that all the data pertaining to the BCs should be collected by a statutory BC commission and not by other agencies of the state. All future elections must proceed further with sound empirical data of BCs collected by a BC commission, the bench said while hearing a batch of petitions that brought to the notice of the court the drastic reduction of BC quota from 34% to 22% in the 2019 elections. Appearing for Samala Ravinder, one of the petitioners, Dharmesh Jaiswal, said that the way the state conducted the 2019 elections was against the judgment of the Supreme Court. The state government which earlier said that it relied on the data supplied by BC Commission, however, took a U-turn on Thursday and said that it relied on data collected by the district collectors and the BC finance cooperative corporation. The bench disapproved of this and said that it will examine the validity of Telangana Panchayat Raj Act’s section 201 that allowed the state to get the survey done by BC cooperative finance corporation for arriving at population statistics and for reserving seats for BCs. The bench directed additional advocate general J Ramachandra Rao to file an affidavit on why section 201 should not be quashed because it is clearly violating the constitutional mandate. The case was adjourned to June first week. The bench clearly narrated the errors the state committed in the run-up to the 2019 panchayat raj elections. The bench heard the argument of state counsel that they were under pressure to complete the elections even by the courts. “No court would ask you to violate the provisions of the constitution. You can always explain and seek relief from courts,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-raps-state-for-incomplete-data-on-bcs/articleshow/82203530.cms||---

They not only exposed themselves but also causing danger of infection to the public,” the order said. In its latest order, the commission said every person should wear a facemask during every election-related activity. At the entry of polling station and premises used for election purpose, sanitizer should be made available. Aarogya Setu App has been made mandatory to all election- related personnel. “It is the responsibility of the organisers of public meetings, rallies to provide masks and sanitisers to every person attending these meetings at their cost, which would be added and counted within limits of prescribed expenditure. Organisers shall also ensure proper usage of masks, sanitisers and also be responsible for maintaining social distance,” the SEC said. Star campaigners and political leaders should set an example to their supporters by adhering to the norms. All the election authorities have been asked to take strict measures to enforce Covid guidelines during campaign. They could cancel public meetings, rallies, etc. if any violations were observed, in addition to invoking penal sections. General and expenditure observers, SST Teams, Police etc., should strictly monitor and ensure strict enforcement of these guidelines during elections, the SEC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sec-cuts-campaign-time-by-24-hours/articleshow/82203539.cms||Koride Mahesh

Opposition leader and former chief minister Digambar Kamat said with patients gasping for breath in hospitals, BJP has no moral right to continue in power. Congress has blamed the BJP for prioritising elections, celebrations and public events while ignoring health care. Kamat said that BJP has completely failed to provide basic medical facilities and has now denied a decent farewell to those who die of Covid. He said that it is “unfortunate” that relatives have to wait for hours to cremate bodies of their loved ones. “This government had other preferences of organising mega events for self-glorification. They did not utilise the time of almost eight months to take precautionary measures anticipating the second wave of Covid,” Kamat said. He pointed out that since March 2020 he has been asking the BJP government to form a task force with experts from civil society and the armed forces to handle the Covid-19 pandemic. “Unfortunately, the BJP government preferred to celebrate with ‘Taali Bajav, Thaali Bajav, Diya Jalav’ events. The disgusting attitude of the BJP government has pushed people into a Covid death trap,” Kamat said. Meanwhile, Congress spokesperson Tulio De Souza said that the state appears to lack a clear roadmap to tackle the rise in Covid-19 cases. “This government does not appear to have an action plan and the directions issued on Wednesday suggest that there is no clarity about the curbs or measures taken to slow down the pandemic. The government has totally failed in tackling the Covid pandemic and has put every Goan at risk,” Souza said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/time-for-prez-to-intervene-cong/articleshow/82204576.cms||---

Permutations and combinations have been worked out by various parties taking into account local factors. The state leaderships of all the political parties have decided that alliances in the urban local bodies polls will be based on local dynamics. The two left parties have gone separate ways in Khammam municipal corporation. While CPI is sailing with the ruling TRS, the CPM has struck an alliance with the Congress. Of the total 60 seats in Khammam, the Congress is contesting in 50 wards and has allocated 9 wards to the CPM. Even the TDP has decided to back Congress and is contesting in alliance with Congress in one ward. In sharp contrast, both the Left parties are going alone in Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation (GWMC). The Congress and the two Left parties failed to strike a deal. The CPI and CPM had sought 22 out of the total 66 wards in GWMC, but Congress said the Left’s demand is untenable. Telangana Congress Warangal district president N Rajender Reddy said that GWMC is spread over four assembly constituencies. There is no electoral alliance with Left parties in the corporation. However, contesting candidates have been given freedom to seek the help of CPI and CPM based on local electoral prospects in each ward. TRS is not contesting from ward number 28 in Jalpally municipality following a request by the AIMIM. The bypoll was necessitated following the death of MIM corporator Nazia Begum. In Lingojiguda ward, TRS has decided against fielding a candidate against BJP. However, Congress is contesting the election from this ward. Political parties have also worked out electoral understanding in Atchampet, Nakrekal, Jadcherla and Siddipet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/potpourri-of-political-alliances-in-urban-local-body-polls/articleshow/82203556.cms||Roushan Ali

HC rejects T proposal||Hyderabad: The high court on Thursday rejected the state government’s offer of Rs 5,000 per month towards honorarium for retired judges who will be appointed to head the Telangana State Pollution Control Appellate Authority (TSPCAA). A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy was hearing a batch of petitions questioning the non-constitution of the appellate authority. When advocate general BS Prasad said the government addressed a letter to the high court to approve some names of the retired judges to be appointed as chairman and members of the appellate authority, the judges told him that they went through the letter which offered a paltry honorarium and a fee of Rs 1,000 per sitting. “This is demeaning and not in tune with the dignity of the judiciary. Retired judges should at least get their last drawn salary as honorarium. If you come out with such a proposal, then we will approve your panel,” the judges said. “Issue a fresh GO and tell us by April 27,” the judges said. The industries that are facing penal action from the PCB can approach the authority if they are aggrieved by the action of the PCB. Those fighting against polluting industries too can approach this appellate authority if their representations do not receive adequate attention from the PCB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rs-5k-salary-for-ex-judge-hc-rejects-t-proposal/articleshow/82203548.cms||---

The place was full of senior citizens... A couple we know had come at 7 am and had still not made it to the vaccination room. We still decided to get a coupon. The police said there was no stock and refused to issue any. As crowds swelled, there was a near stampede. “The police shoved people around and let those who had coupons stay and pushed out the rest, including us,” said John. On Thursday, the couple went to Nair hospital. “It was a breeze. The staff were helpful and social distancing was maintained... It was a different experience at a public hospital. And, the jab was free,” said John.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sr-citizens-go-for-vax-get-a-heavy-dose-of-chaos-disorder/articleshow/82204550.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Businessman offers free oxygen refill||MOHALI/CHANDIGARH: The cost of empty oxygen cylinders has skyrocketed in Chandigarh as the demand for the gas has increased with rising Covid cases. The family members of patients alleged that the empty oxygen cylinders, which earlier were priced at Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,500, were now costing between Rs 8,000 and Rs 13,000. However, an industrialist has offered to re-fill the cylinders free of cost for those under home isolation. Rupinder Singh Sachdeva, who has a unit in Mohali, said, “We have been refilling oxygen cylinders free of cost for those approaching us with empty ones for patients under home isolation. But we have been told that the empty cylinder’s cost has escalated from Rs 3,500 to about Rs 8,000 to Rs 13,000.” Amrik Singh, a resident of Sector 118, Mohali, after getting a cylinder refilled, said, “My father Ajaib Singh is under home isolation after doctors discharged him and asked us to put him on oxygen. We purchased an empty cylinder from Chandigarh for Rs 8,000 and got it filled free of cost here in Mohali.” Harsh of Sector 40, Chandigarh, also purchased an empty cylinder for Rs 8,000. “Medical equipment suppliers are selling empty cylinders at high prices. Thanks to Rupinder Singh Sachdeva, who is refilling the cylinder free of cost, we got the oxygen.” Another resident of Sector 40, accusing the medical equipment suppliers of making money out of pandemic and the UT administration of failing to check the exorbitant prices, said the government must take action against those profiteering. He said, “We were told by GMH-16 about free oxygen available at a Mohali industry. We purchased an empty cylinder for Rs 10,000 from Sector 16 and came here to get it refilled.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/empty-cylinder-prices-skyrocket-good-samaritan-offers-free-refill/articleshow/82203550.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

This happened after bodies of two Covid-19 patients were swapped.Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan has marked an inquiry. The incident came to light when Rajesh Garg, along with his family members, went to claim the body of his dead paternal uncle at Shalby Hospital in Mohali. His uncle, Kulwant Rai Aggarwal (74), had died of Covid-19 a day before and his body was kept at the mortuary along with another dead patient. In the mortuary, Garg said, when they insisted to see the face of the body, they were shocked to find that it was not of his uncle.Garg said, “We asked the hospital authorities to give the body of my uncle, but they dilly-dallied. When we pressed, they revealed that there were two patients who had died on the same day due to Covid and the family members of the other dead man mistakenly took the body of our uncle. We took the photo of the body being given to us and rushed to the family that had taken the body of our uncle. We learnt that the family had already cremated him, and they immediately recognised the photo of their family member.” Abhinav Srivastava, chief administrative officer (CAO), Shalby Hospital, Phase 9, said, “Two persons died due to Covid on the same day and we kept the bodies in the mortuary. One family came and identified the body and took it away. When another family came, it claimed it was not their kin’s body and started creating a ruckus. We are not at fault.”Inconsolable son of Kulwant Rai Aggarwal said, “It is the fault of the hospital authorities. They handed over the body to the wrong family without identification and confirmation. When we reached the cremation ground, we were left with only ashes.”The other family will be visiting the hospital on Friday to take their kin for cremation.Garg said his uncle lived in Rourkela, Orissa, and had come to Panipat to see his ailing mother. Kulwant got infected and was admitted to a Panipat hospital, but as the facilities were not up to the mark, he was shifted here. The family has also lodged a complaint with the Phase 8 police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-hospital-swaps-bodies-family-cremates-wrong-person/articleshow/82203541.cms||---
---||Mumbai||It’s a big crisis, but you are on your own: Sena ‘decodes’ Modi’s speech in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Taking a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his address to the nation on Tuesday, Shiv Sena said citizens had expected to gain some “strength” on how to face the situation as Covid cases are rising, but the crux of the speech was that “the crisis is big, but you figure out your own way” and don’t depend on the Centre. In an editorial published in its mouthpiece ‘Saamna’ on Thursday, the party claimed that the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar and political mela in West Bengal had led to the spread of Covid-19 across India. Referring to Modi’s suggestion that lockdowns should be the “last resort” of states, the editorial said focus should be on action, rather than delivering speeches. Questioning the basis on which the PM made the statement, the editorial stated: “Maharashtra, where Covid cases are rising, does not have any other option but to impose lockdown to break the chain of coronavirus. Even many ministers in the state demanded a 15-day strict lockdown. CM Uddhav Thackeray will take a call on this, but on what basis did the Prime Minister advise to avoid lockdown.” It added: “Modi said this was a storm and has to be tackled with unity, but he did not give any solutions...The PM expressed grief, but what are you doing to curb the toll? The situation is critical not just in Maharashtra, but across the country. People expected to gain strength from his address, but the crux of the speech was ‘the crisis is big, but you figure out your own way, and take care’.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/its-a-big-crisis-but-you-are-on-your-own-sena-decodes-modis-speech-in-mumbai/articleshow/82204540.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

These 11 companies have given detailed presentations to technical experts and senior officers of the municipal corporation. The MC general house will take up the matter during its monthly meeting next week and select a company. The MC had asked firms to specifically focus on processing of dry and wet garbage in the presentation. “In the dry waste segment, conversion of waste to energy that is refuse-derived fuel (RDF) was the key area of discussion. In the wet waste category, converting it into compost and bio-methanation were main points put on the table,” sources said. Besides the technical and administrative officers and councillors, the civic body had also taken the services of experts from outside. They included a professor from Punjab Engineering College (PEC) and an environment engineer from the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC). Their services were sought to get the best technology that is viable in case of Chandigarh and its generated garbage. Sources said sufficient time was given to all the 13 companies who showed their interest in the project. As two did not turn up, so the presentations of 11 were being considered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/11-firms-keen-mc-house-to-pick-one-next-week/articleshow/82203577.cms||Deepak Yadav

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvananthapuram: Coastal wards in district maintain low TPR, efforts taken to avert a peak||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The coastal wards in the district, both in rural and urban areas, where Covid-19 cases raged out of control in the first wave have so far managed to avert a peak. Even while Covid graph has been rocketing across other wards in the district, the number of cases being reported from coastal areas, which had been the hotspots in 2020, is very nominal. Anchuthengu panchayat, which had reported over 300 cases in August first week last year, has reported 13 cases in the past one week. Over 300 samples have been tested as part of augmented testing strategy and routine collection. Two of the patients had returned to village from other state. Colony-wise infection which was a common pattern in 2020 has not been reported here till date, officials said. Mass testing was organized on Friday and Saturday and some of the results are still being awaited. In order to overcome test reluctance among the villagers, the panchayat and health authorities have mandated Covid testing for patients who visit health centres for routine medical care. “This is the only way we are able to bring them for testing,” said Anchuthengu panchayat president V Laiju. At Kadinamkulam where cluster infection was widely reported in 2020, the authorities are dealing with strong resistance to testing. “We are organizing a meeting of all the representatives to deal with this resistance,” said panchayat president Ajitha Ani. Community transmission had ravaged Karumkulam panchayat in almost all the wards in 2020. At present the panchayat has got 11 active cases. “Our major concern is that only a very little percentage of panchayat population has been vaccinated among priority groups. Even some of them who had received their first dose are unable to get the second dose due to lack of supply,” said Karumkulam panchayat president Chinchu M. Poonthura and Manikyavilakom, which had triggered community spread last year, have also been quiet so far. Manikyavilakom has got seven active cases at present, however ward councillor S M Basheer said they can’t be complacent. “The results of mass testing conducted five days ago are still being awaited. The situation is bit tricky here,” he said. “It was pretty much like last year, we started peaking in July and August. Even when we compare present figures to that of last year around March and April, cases are higher here although it is no match to what is being reported from other parts of the district,” a health official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/coastal-wards-in-dist-maintain-low-tpr-efforts-taken-to-avert-a-peak/articleshow/82202693.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Delhi||Out of oxygen, Hindu Rao puts off plan to add beds||New Delhi: Hindu Rao Hospital has put its plans to increase the number of Covid beds to 350 on hold due to no oxygen supply. At present, the hospital has 210 beds, all of which are occupied. North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor said that they have oxygen supply for two days for the current patients and will increase the number of beds only after fresh supply is arranged. “After several calls and mails to departments concerned and requests to Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar for oxygen supply from an industrial plant in Faridabad, we were to receive a 5,000 cubic metre tanker. However, it was later directed to another hospital in Delhi. This has increased our worries. Plans for any new admissions at Covid wards may be put on hold too,” said mayor Jai Prakash. Prakash said the hospital expects fresh supply soon, which will fulfill requirements for 5-6 days. “Once things are in place we will open the site for patients,” he said further. Due to the crisis, the civic body has decided to start an isolation facility at Balak Ram Hospital, which does not have oxygen or ICU facilities. “The site can be used by those who have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic and can’t isolate at home. We will provide medicines, basic equipment, food and other facilities here,” said Jai Prakash. After a long struggle, East Delhi Municipal Corporation managed to get a supply of 4,500 cubic metres of oxygen on Thursday afternoon at the Covid ward in Swami Dayanand Hospital. However, it will take another two days to increase the number of beds to 75. “The pipeline supply is fully operational and the oxygen cylinders at the hospital are now filled ,” said a senior EDMC official. Meanwhile, South Delhi Municipal Corporation has arranged for 60 cylinders and 15 oxygen concentrators, but there is no plan to increase the number of beds for now. “Forty beds with oxygen are fully operational and so far, 10 are occupied. We will be taking a decision for increasing beds once the demand increases, probably in another two-three days,” said an SDMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/out-of-oxygen-hindu-rao-puts-off-plan-to-add-beds/articleshow/82203618.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Dehradun||Haridwar's positivity rate stays low compared to other districts||NAINITAL: On April 1, the official start of Kumbh, the positivity rate in Haridwar was 1.3%. After three weeks and two shahi snans (on April 12, when 35 lakh devotees turned up and April 14, when the footfall was around 14 lakh), the positivity rate on April 21 had risen to 4% and 3.5%on April 22 (Thursday). Since the Kumbh officially started, Haridwar, which covers two thirds of the mela area, has recorded over 8,500 Covid-19 cases. However, even though the positivity rate has gone up in Haridwar since the start of Kumbh, it is still within the safe limit (which is considered to be 5%) and low compared to other districts in Uttarakhand. The positivity rate in Doon, some parts of which also fall under Kumbh area, is currently 20%. The district has consistently recorded the highest daily coronavirus cases and accounted for half of the state’s daily spike. On Wednesday, as 818 out of 1,690 samples tested positive, Nainital recorded a positivity rate of 48.40%. In Tehri, the positivity rate was 30% and 21% in Pauri Garhwal. With so many people congregating at Haridwar creating concerns of the disease spreading, why does the case count continue to be low? Anoop Nautiyal of Doon-based Social Development for Communities Foundation, said the data of Haridwar needs to be audited by a third party to establish why the positivity rate is so low compared to the other districts. “The data (from Haridwar) shows that there has been a steady increase in both the number of cases and positivity rates. However, in the last 21 days, the average positivity rate has been less than 2% and in the same duration, the average positivity rate in other districts was around 10%. I believe there is a need for a third party to audit the data of Haridwar,” he said. Second, the effects of Kumbh are yet to surface and people could start to test positive in large numbers in the coming days. It has been around a week since major gatherings took place at the shahi snans, the time it takes for symptoms of the virus to show. If it takes another two to three days for an infected person to get tested and receive reports, the numbers would start to show in the coming days. The Kumbh Mela administration, however, said that the numbers were low because they were able to effectively control the crowd. “We have been able to limit the numbers through rigorous testing at the borders and implementation of the SOPs. We also expect the Covid-19 cases to remain in check in the coming days as well,” a mela official, who did not wish to be named, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/positivity-rate-of-haridwar-where-lakhs-gathered-for-kumbh-remains-low-compared-to-other-districts/articleshow/82202687.cms||Prashant Jha

Sanganer MLA Ashok Lahoty said that giving Remdesivir to the neighbouring state at the peak of pandemic is unfortunate. He said, “In the crisis of this dreaded pandemic, the people of Rajasthan are trampling and have to run from pillar to post to get one injection while the chief minister, ministers and officials are engaged in presenting their liberal image. What kind of Gandhigiri is this? And what justice is there with the state.” Lahoty said that due to this poor decision of the government, this crisis has become even more frightening in Rajasthan as these injections are being sold illegally for Rs 30,000 to Rs 40,000 in open market. “Officials are now defending themselves stating that they gave the injections because they were about to expire. It seems that in Rajasthan, such misdeeds have been done with the connivance of officials and brokers, for which the people of Rajasthan will never forgive the government,” said Lahoty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rajs-plan-to-give-remdesivir-to-punjab-unfortunate-bjp/articleshow/82203605.cms||---

---||Lucknow||More patients gasp to death as hospitals run out of beds||Lucknow: Amit Kumar (61) died waiting in an ambulance for three hours at the gates of a hospital in Chinhat on Thursday. His family kept pleading and crying for mercy, even as the ambulance staff performed non-stop cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to save every single breath of the Covid-19 patient whose blood oxygen level was extremely low. The hospital denied admission citing non-availability of beds. As the heart-wrenching videos of the wailing family members went viral, the casualty added one more Covid-19 patient to the list of those dying for want of bed in Covid hospitals overwhelmed with critical patients infected by ongoing devastating second wave of the pandemic. Like Kumar’s family, many were left grieving for their loved ones only because medical help could not reach them in time because either there was a delay in allotment of beds by the Integrated Covid Command Control Centre (ICCC) or the office of the chief medical officer (CMO) took a lot of time in issuing referrals or authorities sent patients to hospitals without verifying bed availability. “The hospital could have saved my husband but they didn’t. My two children have been orphaned by the system,” said an inconsolable Sarita, wife of Amit Kumar. “We waited outside the hospital. Nobody helped us. We could see vehicles of doctors moving out of the hospital but no one bothered to ask us about the emergency or provided any aid. The ambulance staff performed CPR but we couldn’t save him," she said. The ambulance arrived at Kumar’s residence at 12.43pm and reached the hospital by 2.25pm. However, he had to wait for three hours inside the ambulance. His wife and daughter hysterically kept on requesting medical authorities for emergency care but to no avail. Even the ambulance driver pleaded with authorities on phone but failed to convince them. Mohammad Hasan (70) died gasping on Thursday evening. He was tested Covid-19 positive on Tuesday and his condition started deteriorating on Wednesday morning. His family called ICCC and got the response after four hours. “By then, his blood oxygen levels dropped to 60%. ICCC registered our case but told us that they will inform us as soon as the bed is available. We then arranged an oxygen cylinder to help him at home but he could not survive,” said Hasan’s daughter Zubeda. Sachchidanand Srivastava (34) died on way to hospital in ambulance. “We were trying for a bed for the last two days and got one on Thursday morning. However, his blood oxygen levels had dropped to 40 by then,” said Abhyanand, elder brother of the deceased. Tripti Chaurasia (55), a teacher, died before a bed could be allotted to her. “For two days, her blood oxygen level had been fluctuating between 60-70%. We were told by ICCC on Tuesday that bed will be allotted as soon as possible but the call never came. She passed away on Thursday afternoon,” said Tripti’s son Akshit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/more-patients-gasp-to-death-as-hospitals-run-out-of-beds/articleshow/82204583.cms||---

The cabinet while expressing concern over the current Covid situation said the quantity of oxygen and remdesivir allocated to Rajasthan was much less than the requirement according to the number of active cases. The cabinet noted that on April 21, only 26, 500 remdesivir injections were allotted while Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh received 1.63 lakh and 92,200 doses where the case load was much less. Rajasthan got only 27.5% of the allotment considering in proportion to active cases while the allotment to Gujarat and MP was 194% and 112%. The cabinet also demanded to provide free vaccination to the 18-44 age group which is to be launched in May. The cabinet also appealed to the people to get the registration of CM Chiranjeevi medical insurance scheme done by April 30 so that the huge cost of Covid treatment is also covered under the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/allocate-oxygen-in-proportion-to-active-cases-cabinet/articleshow/82203623.cms||---

The court held that prima-facie, the accused, Naved Qureshi, was found violating the pandemic guidelines. It said that the group had gathered with a common intention and they disobeyed the orders of police, thus, endangering the life of public at large.  “Even if the accused would be released on stringent conditions, it will be serious menace to the general public at large as he did not abide by the guidelines issued by the authority. Therefore, I do not find it necessary at this stage to release the applicant on bail,” the court said. Qureshi, was arrested for the incident that allegedly took place on April 4 at Kamathipura. Another boy who was also suspected to be involved, was found to be a minor. Others are absconding. Qureshi moved for bail before a sessions court after a magistrate court rejected his plea.

---||Pune||Gift bait: Senior woman executive cheated of Rs 3.9 crore||PUNE: A man claiming to be a medical practitioner from the UK duped a senior woman executive of a private firm, aged around 60, of Rs 3.9 crore using the same old modus of expensive gifts, followed by extortion calls. Till April 8, the suspect and his aides compelled the woman to make 207 money transfers to 67 accounts in 25 different banks. The woman (her details were withheld by the police) became friends with the suspect on a social networking site in September last year. “The suspect, who posed as a medical practitioner from the UK, had sent her a friend request on her social media account. After befriending the woman, he also shared his cellphone number, after which they started chatting over a messaging app,” inspector Ankush Chintaman of the cyber police told TOI. During their conversations, the man promised to send her some jewellery and a high-end smartphone as a gift on her birthday. “Later, he told the woman that her consignment had reached the international airport in New Delhi but was with the customs department, which was asking for money to release it,” Chintaman said. Eventually, he made the woman transfer some money to a bank account provided by him. “Few days later, the woman received a call from an unknown number. The caller asked her to transfer money for paying income tax as the value of the articles in the consignment was quite high,” the officer said. The officer said the unsuspecting woman then made a number of money transfers to various bank accounts as payment of different taxes and charges. “After a while, the suspect’s aides started blackmailing her by posing as government officials. They told her since the consignment was sent to her illegally, a case could be filed against her. The terrified woman again made a number of money transfers to different bank accounts as and when the aides contacted her.” In total, the woman transferred Rs 3.9 crore to the suspects in a matter of seven months, before she realized she had been duped and lodged a complaint on April 21. “The entire amount was transferred from her own bank account. We have sought details from the complainant’s bank. The suspects used seven different mobile numbers to commit the crime,” Chintaman said. The police have registered the case under sections 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating), 385 (putting person in fear of injury in order to commit extortion) of the Indian Penal Code and the relevant sections of the Information and Technology Act. Experts said this was not the first time that conmen used gift bait to dupe a person. They said people should not believe online friends and always double-check and approach police in such cases. “The customs department officials never asks for bribe to release any parcel,” an expert said. It is always better not to accept friend requests from unkown people.  “Parents used to tell their children not to get friendly with unknown people and the cyber world is also the same where people should not fall for such people and their tricks,” another expet said, adding that awareness was the key to prevent such frauds in the society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/gift-bait-senior-woman-executive-cheated-of-rs-3-9cr/articleshow/82204620.cms||Mihir Tanksale

Many private schools conducted their online classes as usual as the physical classes are shut down due to lockdown. While the parents’ association objected to this stating it to be a tactic of private schools to get fees from parents, some parents have shown interest that online education should continue. Abhishek Jain Bittu, spokesperson of Sanyukt Abhibhavak Sangh, said, “This is just other tactics of private schools to have a reason for getting fees from parents. There is an order of the government which schools should have followed. Why were they conducting classes against the order? The state government must act against these schools as it is a burden on the children and parents.” The contention of schools is that they didn’t get enough time to declare holidays. A principal of private school on condition of anonymity said, “We get to know it in the morning that some order of the government was issued. At least they should have given us some time to prepare about the plan. They cannot just overnight tell us to stop the classes a day after.” Meanwhile, Damodar Goyal, president, Society for Private Unaided Schools in Rajasthan has written to the director of Secondary Education, Bikaner and secretary of school education that the order for summer vacation appears to be meant for government schools and maximum to non-government schools affiliated to Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education. “It is clear that neither the teachers of unaided Private schools are deputed for any kind of Covid duty nor RSR are applicable. It is further not clear from the said circular that whether the non-government schools are permitted to conduct online classes or not? Parents are requesting us to conduct online classes for their wards to ensure no learning gap and continuous course of study,” said Goyal. Some parents have even expressed desire for the continuation of online classes. Seema Aggarwal, whose children’s studies in Class VII and III, said, “In complete lockdown children cannot go outside for sports activity and now online classes are shut. What are we supposed to do for the next two months? It is better for the online classes to continue so that our children will be engage in some constructive work.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/schools-flout-govt-order-on-summer-vacation/articleshow/82203612.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Inhaled steroids may soon be used to treat Covid-19 in Maharashtra||MUMBAI: Inhaled steroids, mainly used to treat asthma and other serious respiratory problems, may soon be added to the list of “off-label treatment” for Covid-19 patients in Maharashtra. The Maharashtra government’s task force on Covid-19 is preparing guidelines for use of inhaled steroid budesonide for patients with mild to moderate symptoms. “We may announce this addition within the next few days,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the task force. Two puffs of budesonide daily for 14 days could reduce the risk of hospitalisation in mild to moderately ill Covid-19 patients by 91% (as compared to Covid-19 patients on regular treatment), according to a study published by Oxford University in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine earlier this month. After the study was published, the UK National Health Service introduced inhaled steroid in the list of medicines used “off label” for Covid-19 patients. “Fewer participants on budesonide had persistent symptoms at day 14 and day 28 compared to participants receiving usual care,” said the Lancet study. Doctors whom TOI spoke to said that inhaled steroids have been used by medical practitioners in Mumbai since May 2020. A doctor from a BMC hospital said that budesonide has a role to play in a certain subsection of Covid-19 patients. “It cannot be used for all Covid-19 patients. It is best to let the doctor decide instead of the patient deciding that they need inhaled steroids,” said the doctor. Pulmonologist Dr Sujit Rajan from Tardeo’s Bhatia Hospital too treats mild to moderate Covid-19 patients with budesonide. “In September, my team called up all the 170 asthma patients in our care and found out that only one had got Covid. None of the patients with other lung diseases had caught the infection either,” he said. This showed they had protection perhaps from the inhaled steroids they need to use daily. Dr Sundeep Salvi of the Chest Research Foundation in Pune said budesonide could be the potential game changer in the pandemic. “The Oxford study showed that if recently infected Covid-19 patients start taking inhaled steroids as soon as symptoms such as sore throat and cough start, they would benefit immensely,” he said. On the plus side, budesonide has been used for children and pregnant women with asthma for around four decades. “It is mild, affordable and easily available. Oral steroids given to severely ill Covid patients are 40 times the strength of inhaled steroids,” pointed out Dr Rajan. But several doctors are worried about the inadequate research and potential misuse in India. “Asthmatics are trained by counsellers to use the inhaler properly. If the shot is not delivered properly, it could increase the risk of a patient getting a fungal infection,” said a doctor. Another said that while treating Covid-19 patients with inhaled steroids, care must be taken to ensure the patients don’t have underlying disease such as tuberculosis. A doctor from a civic hospital said there is no “cellular level” proof that inhaled steroids work. “We know that it works at the cellular level for asthma patients, but there is no equivalent research for Covid-19,” said the doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/inhaled-steroids-may-soon-be-used-to-treat-covid-19-in-maharashtra/articleshow/82204639.cms||Malathy Iyer

He appealed to the people to maintain distance, wear masks and adhere to Covid protocol and guidelines. He has also requested industrialists, factory owners and people associated with the construction industry to have appropriate humanitarian behaviour towards the workers. He said along with the compliance of the rules for protection from Covid, special care should also be taken at all levels to ensure that employment-related activities are not disrupted, no migration of workers, no problem for farmers to sell their produce. Mishra said that this new wave of corona is dangerous. It is important to save themselves from Covid. He said that we will be able to beat Corona only with caution, vigilance, vaccination and a humanitarian approach. He also appealed to the common people to follow the curfew imposed on various activities by the state government under ‘Public Discipline Fortnight’. He said that this is a difficult period and people should be careful and alert and not be negligent at any level.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Covid refuses to slow down, 432 funerals in a single day||NEW DELHI: The number of Covid-protocol funerals in the city continues to spike, with the civic report stating that 432 such funerals took place on Wednesday till 7pm — up from 193 on April 16. Over 410 Covid funerals were conducted on Tuesday, 357 on Monday and 290 on Sunday. A total of 1,947 Covid-protocol funerals have taken place in the six days since April 16.  The consistent rise means the crematoria in Mangolpuri, Dwarka and Subhash Nagar are running beyond their Covid-reserved capacity while the Panchkuian Road burning ghat is catering to almost double — 27 instead of 15 — Covid patients’ bodies daily. The rush has led to longer waiting times for grieving families. A senior municipal official said the cremation capacity had been revised three times in last two weeks and over 70-80% pyres at all major crematoria currently stood reserved for Covid bodies. The city now has 23 such facilities with a capacity to carry out 655 cremations every day. On Wednesday, 181 Covid bodies were received at 10 cremation and burial grounds under North Delhi Municipal Corporation, 212 bodies at nine centres under South Delhi Municipal Corporation and 39 at six facilities under East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC). The Nigambodh Ghat crematorium, one of three centres operating even at night, received maximum 80 bodies, the Punjabi Bagh facility 68 and the Mangolpuri ground 44. The Mangolpuri facility is the only place in the city which has a crematorium, burial ground and a cemetery. The north corporation has decided to increase the number of pyres at the Paschim Vihar crematorium from 32 to 60; at the Inderpuri crematorium, from 10 to 24; while the Rohini Sector 26 facility will have 42 Covid funeral pyres. EDMC mayor Nirmal Jain said 10 temporary pyres would be built at the Ghazipur facility while 24 temporary platforms had been added at Seemapuri. EDMC has also started east Delhi’s first CNG cremation furnace at Karkardooma. Jain said the furnace would complete the funeral in just 45 minutes and relatives would be able to collect the ashes after 1.5 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-refuses-to-slow-down-432-funerals-in-a-single-day/articleshow/82203687.cms||Paras Singh
---||Pune||Close-call nights at jumbo hubs due to O2 crisis, big hosps feel the pinch||Pune: Tuesday and Wednesday nights were one of the close-call nights for the officials associated with the 200-bed autocluster facility in Chinchwad and 800-bed Annasaheb Magar stadium jumbo unit in Pimpri, as the depleting supply and unavailability of oxygen forced the authorities to calculate and conserve its consumption. Sangram Kapale, dean of the Annasaheb Magar stadium jumbo unit, told TOI, “There was no supply of oxygen till late Tuesday night and we had to take various measures to conserve oxygen. Right from to filter out the patients who need it most to the ones who could do away without it for a while. It was a neck-to-neck call. It is scary for the fact that over 700 of our patients are totally dependent on the oxygen support and need almost 18 tonnes of oxygen on a daily basis.” He said the patients admitted to the facility were “mostly in a bad shape” with many of their oxygen saturation level being as low as 35. The situation at the autocluster facility was similar on Wednesday, when it was almost on the verge of exhausting its 5 tonne stock of oxygen and had to conserve the gas till the tankers late in the evening. Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) commissioner Rajesh Patil told TOI that the neck-to-neck situation, where oxygen needed to be conserved at either autocluster or the Magar stadium jumbo facility were true and the situation has been like that for the past two-three days. “We are trying to streamline the process, but it will take time,” he said. State-run Sassoon hospital in Pune city has two big tanks with a collective storage capacity of 28,000 litre of liquid medical oxygen. “Despite this capacity, we have kept a back-up of another 300 jumbo cylinders as many patients needing oxygen support are being referred to our hospital not only from Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad but from rural areas and even adjoining districts. This has put a massive strain on the resources,” said the hospital’s dean, Muralidhar Tambe. “Sometimes, we are even forced to accommodate two to three Covid patients on the same bed in the casualty till they are finally allocated ward beds of the discharged patients. We cannot turn down patients as other private hospitals do. We need to save their lives and make sure, they get required medical attention,” Tambe said. The PCMC arranged 39 tonnes of oxygen from Wednesday evening to Thursday evening, and distributed it to theAnnasaheb Magar jumbo unit in Pimpri, Autocluster medical facility and Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital. Big hospitals across the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) have started feeling the pinch of medical oxygen deficit. Most hospitals TOI spoke to reported neck-to-neck demand-supply ratio and expressed anxiety over facing the crunch if the situation remained unchanged for a few more days. The crisis situation arose after many small and medium-sized Covid hospitals relying on the daily supply of oxygen cylinders adopted a cautious stand and stopped admitting hypoxic patients needing oxygen support owing to the short supply. This has put a massive strain on big hospitals treating Covid patients in the PMR. Consumption of medical oxygen in the Pune district has reached 383 metric tonnes as against its full daily production capacity of 350 tonnes. Abrarali Dalal, chief operating officer (CEO), Sahyadri group of hospitals said, "The concern around oxygen supply is increasing day by day.Though we have been able to manage our requirements as of now, we hope seamless regular supply is restored soon. Our current daily requirement is about 6,000 cubic metres (8 metric tonnes) across units in Deccan, Kothrud, Surya, Nagar Road, Hadapsar, and Bibwewadi. The supply closely matches the demand and that is the concern.” Critical care expert Prasad Rajhans, chief intensivist of Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital, said, “Our daily requirement of medical oxygen has already registered a 10-fold jump. Our huge medical oxygen storage tank, which we needed to fill every week, is not being replenished every day. Anxiety looms whenever the tank lowers to the point where it needs to be immediately replenished.” Bharati hospital — one of the biggest Covid hospitals in the private sectors — also stares at the looming shortage of medical-grade oxygen. “We have two massive tanks holding a total 18,000 litre (18 metric tonnes) of liquid oxygen. Whenever the storage level goes below 6,000 litre, the anxiety creeps in. This is because daily requirements have reached 6,000 litre (6 metric tonnes),” said Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director, Bharati hospital. “The sudden shortage of medical oxygen and even some necessary drugs like remdesivir is making the city’s fight against Covid more difficult by the day. Authorities need to replenish the supply and also need to support small and medium-sized hospitals with uninterrupted oxygen supply so that they start treating hypoxic Covid patients,” said health activist Abhijit More. Except for the big hospitals, most small and medium-sized hospitals are relying on a daily supply of medical oxygen. “If this continues, big hospitals will confront the hardships over the shortage,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association's Hospital Board of India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/close-call-nights-at-jumbo-hubs-due-to-o2-crisis-big-hosps-feel-the-pinch/articleshow/82204631.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Two months ago, the HC had given four weeks to the three aforementioned authorities and a private respondent who was eventually selected for the job, to file their responses to Chaturvedi’s petition but none of the respondents could file their affidavits till Thursday (April 22). As reported by TOI earlier, petitioner Chaturvedi has alleged that his records, including his date of birth and the date of receipt of his application, were forged under a ‘criminal conspiracy’ to debar him from the selection process of the members of the SSC. The petition adds that the committee tasked with the selection rejected his application, citing that he did not have a postgraduate degree but an AIGNFA (Associate of Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy) diploma. This was despite a notification issued by the Forest Research Institute (FRI) stating that an AIGNFA diploma should be considered equivalent to MSc (Forestry). Chaturvedi has urged the HC to set aside the appointment of Om Prakash and order a fresh recruitment exercise. He has also requested a CBI probe in the matter. However, the HC did not issue notice to the CBI stating it will first wait for the responses of the other respondents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/sanjiv-chaturvedis-petition-against-selection-process-of-ssc-hc-gives-one-more-week-to-respondents-to-file-affidavits/articleshow/82202035.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Lucknow||Long queues continue outside oxygen plants||LUCKNOW: Long queues of people were witnessed outside various oxygen plants for the second consecutive day on Thursday in the city for a cylinder or a refill that can provide some extra breaths to their loved ones suffering from Covid-19. Some had to go back disappointed because of the new rule which prescribed that only those with Aadhaar cards and a doctors’ prescription will get oxygen cylinders. “A person can get oxygen by showing details like Aadhaar card, doctor's prescription with name. The provision has been made to check hoarding of oxygen cylinders,” said officiating district magistrate Roshan Jacob. As the city is facing shortage of oxygen supported beds in the hospitals, many Covid patients are forced to stay at home despite low blood oxygen levels. Families of some of them have converted a room in their houses into `mini HDU’ by installing an oxygen support system with a cylinder and oxygen max, pulse oximeter and medicines after consulting doctors on telephone. However, as oxygen demand is increasing with every passing day, it is becoming harder for people to get some. From two-wheelers to auto and from cycle rickshaw to four-wheeler, people were seen running from one place to another desperately looking for the lifesaving gas. Provincial Armed Constabulary personnel were deployed outside several plants in view of the rush. Aashiana resident Rajan Dubey when reached a plant in Talkatora found a notice on the gate that oxygen will only be given to Covid-19 hospitals, while non-Covid hospitals will have to take permission from the DM. He was told to go to another plant. “My father is down with Covid-19 with blood oxygen level below 80%. I am searching for oxygen for over three hours now,” he told TOI. Ankit Singh of Rajajipura also visited several plants to get oxygen for his critically ill mother. “I was told that the gas will be given only after I bring a doctor’s prescription and Aadhaar card, but when doctors are refusing to see Covid-19 patients at home and beds are not available in hospitals, who on the earth will give us a prescription,” he said. Later, he got a cylinder from a friend in Unnao. Arpita Das (55) of Chowk said that she managed to get a prescription from a doctor friend of his son. “Since my son’s friend knows us well, he readily gave us in writing, otherwise all the doctors in the vicinity had refused saying that they cannot issue a prescription without seeing the patient. And, when we asked them to come home, they refused saying they don’t have PPE kits,” she added. Regarding the problem of getting a prescription, officers said that patients’ family can call Integrated Covid Command Control Centre, Hello Doctor helpline or any of the helpline of government hospitals and request for a prescription by communicating the condition of the patient. They also said that plants have been told to ramp up oxygen production by increasing manpower.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/long-queues-continue-outside-oxygen-plants/articleshow/82204609.cms||---
---||Lucknow||UP: Covid helpline registration, CMO referrals not binding||LUCKNOW: Private Covid care hospitals across the state can now directly admit patients in 90% of their beds, while government-aided hospitals and private medical colleges can follow the norm in 30% of bed strength. The mandatory registration at Integrated Covid Command Control Centres (ICCC) and a referral approval letter from respective chief medical officers (CMO) for hospitalisation in private units will no longer be required. The decision was expedient to cut the inordinate time taken in ICCC registrations and CMO referrals amidst a colossal tragedy, said a government spokesperson. Even if beds were available, private hospitals were not admitting patients without ICCC registration and CMO referral, triggering demands for scrapping the provision. However, both government and private hospitals will have to keep the ICCC and district health and administrative officers updated every day with data on patients admitted and bed occupancy. The move is expected to ease the admission procedure of critically ill patients, subject to availability of beds. In the private hospital category, treatment cost would be according to rates fixed by the government, while rates would be subsidized at government-aided centres. As per the order issued by additional chief secretary, health, Amit Mohan Prasad, private hospitals have to reserve 10% beds in various categories — isolation, HDU and ICU — for admissions through ICCC. Government hospitals, government medical institutes and private medical institutes taken over by the government as Covid facilities will reserve 70% beds for admission through ICCC and rest as per emergency need. This means the registration and referral system will continue in 10% beds in private hospitals and 70% beds in government-supported Covid care facilities. In Lucknow, government-aided facilities include SGPGIMS, KGMU, RMLIMS, Balrampur Hospital, Lokbandhu Hospital, RSM Hospital, Era’s Lucknow Medical College, Integral Institute of Medical Sciences, TSM Medical College, Prasad Institute of Medical Sciences and Career Institute & Medical Sciences Hospital among others. An admission slip from the district administration for admission to 70% beds of these hospitals will be binding. In a press statement, CMO Lucknow, Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar, said, “Till now, an approval letter from CMO was mandatory for admission to a Covid facility. It is no longer required for private hospitals. These hospitals can now take admissions based on bed availability and occupancy." The letter, however, will still be required for admission to government Covid centres, CMO office clarified. “Patient registration was done at ICCC after which the hospital was allotted and a referral letter was made for every patient. Now, patients and their attendants can approach private covid hospitals on their own, as for any other disease. And if the hospital is ready to admit, they can go ahead without a referral letter," said CMO spokesperson Yogesh Raghuvanshi. The new government order also stated that patients are free to use their own conveyance to travel to private hospitals, but if they seek an ambulance, the request has to be forwarded through ICCC. The patient will require a letter from the private hospital granting admission, following which an ambulance will be provided. A dedicated whatsapp number will be provided on which the permission letter and ambulance request can be sent. All hospitals, both private and government, have been directed to paste their bed occupancy update outside their premises and on the ICCC portal, every day at 8 am and 4 pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-helpline-registration-cmo-referrals-not-binding/articleshow/82204640.cms||Yusra Husain

UT adviser Manoj Parida has written the letter to Rajesh Bhushan, secretary, Union ministry of health and family welfare, mentioning an alarming increase in the number of Covid cases in Chandigarh. “We are trying to tackle the crisis by enhancing the capacity of Government Multi-Specialty Hospital, Sector 16, and Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, but the help of PGIMER is urgently required,” the letter said. As of now, the city has 4,273 active cases. Parida requested the secretary to direct the PGI authorities to increase their Covid beds to at least 500—as they have nearly 2,000 beds—and maintain at least 100 ICU beds dedicated to the coronavirus treatment. The UT adviser has also written that PGI may be directed to enhance vaccination of their staff and coordinate with UT’s principal secretary, health, in successfully implementing Covid management plan. Although the PGI was initially made a Covid-dedicated hospital for Chandigarh at the start of the pandemic, the hospital shares the burden of patients from other states as well. As of now, the PGI has 283 Covid beds, 230 non-ICU oxygen beds and 53 ICU beds (including ventilators). Recently, Parida had appointed Yashpal Garg, chief executive officer, Chandigarh Housing Board, as the overall in charge of Covid management in GMCH-32 to coordinate with the director-principal and the medical superintendent to ensure that adequate number of beds, medicines, doctors and infrastructure are available. With the Covid-19 cases spiraling in the city, the Covid beds reserved in both private and government facilities are getting exhausted rapidly. Chandigarh has total 648 Covid and 99 ICU beds.

---||Jaipur||Jodhpur: Posters to be pasted on houses with vaccinated people||JODHPUR: Jodhpur Municipal Corporation (North) has taken a unique initiative with a view to motivate people for vaccination and spread a positive message among the people. Beginning from Thursday, the JMC will be pasting a small poster at the house of every such person who has got vaccinated. Mayor (JMC North) Kunti Deora and commissioner Rohitashwa Tomar jointly launched this initiative and pasted first poster at a house in Pratap Nagar area on Thursday. “Jodhpur is worst affected with corona infection and the immediate solution to this crisis appeared to be the vaccine. But still there is reluctance among the people about the vaccine,” said Deora. She said that the JMC has organised camps in almost every wards to expedite the vaccination and do away with the need of them going in search of places for vaccination. “But even these drives have not helped in desired manner given the disinterest and sluggishness of the people in coming forward in hoards for vaccine. Commissioner Tomar said that there were not as much doubts about vaccine as they were in the beginning and people have started coming forward to get the jab. “But still this is far below the target. So we have decided to recognize such persons, who have got the vaccine shots, so that others could get encouragement and go for vaccination,” Tomar asserted. The poster bearing message “This House is Vaccinated” is aimed at spreading a positive message among reluctant and unspirited deserving persons that they should also have vaccine in order to protect themselves from Corona infection. Tomar said that this drive will also act as a gesture of gratitude for them who have vaccinated themselves and recognise their valuable contribution in country's fight against Covid-19. “Besides, it will also help the JMC in getting such house identified for various other reasons leading to help in fight against Covid-19,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/posters-to-be-pasted-on-houses-with-vaccinated-people/articleshow/82203679.cms||---
---||Jaipur||‘One nation, one vaccine, one rate’ need of hour: Sachin Pilot||JAIPUR: Former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot on Thursday asked the Centre to follow ‘one nation, one vaccine, one rate’ principle to help mitigate suffering of people fighting the Covid-19 pandemic. Pilot questioned the determination of three different rates for a single dose of the same vaccine. “The Centre is buying a vaccine from two manufacturers for Rs 150 per dose. The same vaccine’s 6-crore doses are being purchased from a manufacturer under the PM Care Fund at Rs 210 and 1-crore doses from another manufacturer at Rs 310, which has left the people wondering.” He added, “It is bizarre that the same vaccine will be supplied to the Indian government for Rs 150, to the state governments for Rs 400 and to private hospitals for Rs 600. ‘One nation, one vaccine, one rate’ is the biggest need today to control the hoarding and black marketing of the vaccine.” Pilot said that all state governments were grappling with their resources because of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Under such circumstances the vaccine cost should be borne by the Centre,” he said. Questioning the export of 6-crore doses of the vaccine, Pilot said it was regrettable that the foreign governments had placed supply orders to the Indian vaccine manufacturer before the Indian government did. Pilot expressed concern over the management of oxygen supply and said that despite India being one of the world's leading oxygen manufacturers, the Centre was unable to provide oxygen on time to the helpless patients. “The Centre allowed export of 9300 metric tonnes of oxygen in one year of Covid-19, while it failed to make adequate arrangements for smooth and timely supply of oxygen to every hospital,” Pilot said. He suggested that if necessary, the air routes should be used to transport oxygen. Pilot said that allowing the export of 11-lakh remdesivir injections in the last six months was now playing havoc with serious patients in the country. “There is no remdesivir in hospitals and its black marketing has started. Not only this, now even fake remdesivir stocks are coming to light,” Pilot said. Transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said, “Rajasthan’s 25 MPs, including three union ministers and the Lok Sabha speaker, are quietly watching and not speaking to get relief from the Centre for the people of the state.” The minister said, “Be it Rajasthan, Gujarat, Bengal or Kerala, the pain is the same everywhere. The Centre should have one policy across the country by providing free vaccine-free treatment to people and giving a special package to states to save lives during the pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/one-nation-one-vaccine-one-rate-need-of-hour-pilot/articleshow/82203683.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Make powerlines underground to save GIBs in Gujarat, Rajasthan: SC||Nagpur: The Supreme Court bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad Bobde, Justice AS Bopanna and Justice V Ramasubramanian has directed the Rajasthan and Gujarat governments to lay underground power lines in the identified habitats of Great Indian Bustard (GIB) in the two states. Also, the SC clearly gave a timeline of one year to complete the work. The SC on April 19, 2021, also ordered that all the future power lines must be underground in the areas identified in the order. The court has also ordered the installation of bird-diverters on the power lines till they are made underground so that the birds can see the cables from a distance and avoid colliding with them. The apex court order came while hearing a PIL filed by MK Ranjitsinh, former bureaucrat, Piraram Bishnoi, Navinbhai Bapat, Santosh Martin, and The Corbett Foundation. The petitioners had requested the SC to take necessary decisions for the conservation of GIB & Lesser Florican in the country. The power lines passing through GIB habitats have proved fatal for the birds. It is one of the prime reasons behind the steep decline in GIB population in the past decade. To protect the species, the petitioners requested laying underground power lines in critical bustard habitats and installing bird diverters on all power lines in semi-critical habitats. Apart from this, the PIL also demanded habitat protection, control over disturbance caused by free-ranging dogs and other predators, conservation breeding programme of GIB and stopping any further development and expansion of wind farms and solar parks in the bustard habitat. Even local people of Kutch and Rajasthan have repeatedly complained about the threat these power lines pose to various other bird species in addition to the GIB. The SC stated that GIB is on the verge of extinction, and it is necessary to take this action for the conservation of this endangered species. In response, the power ministry said that the low voltage lines (66kv) could be easily underground while the high voltage lines (130 kv) and above are slightly difficult and expensive to be made underground. The SC said it may be difficult but not impossible. Experts have welcomed the decision. “I welcome this landmark decision. GIBs are struggling to survive and it is our moral responsibility not only to prevent their extinction but also to ensure a safe and secure future for these heaviest flying birds of Indian grasslands,” said Kedar Gore, director, The Corbett Foundation. “This is perhaps the finest judgment of the SC for the long-term protection of the GIB, but we must see that the judgment is strictly followed by the power companies and the governments,” said Asad R Rahmani, former director, Bombay Natural History Society. “I have full trust in the law of this country. Now, the state governments should take immediate actions to underground the power lines. Just like lions and tigers, GIB is also the pride of our nation, and it is our duty to protect it. The European countries have already made their power lines underground for the safety of bustards,” said Devesh Gadhavi, deputy director, The Corbett Foundation. Navinbhai Bapat, a noted birdwatcher and a petitioner said, “I trust that the law of this country and the joint efforts by the conservationists will surely save this species from extinction. Rampant development on the grasslands and pasture land in Kutch will prove detrimental for livestock and wildlife in the long run. Power lines passing through various grasslands and pasture lands are also responsible for numerous fire incidents resulting in the loss of fodder and grass.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/make-powerlines-underground-to-save-gibs-in-gujarat-rajasthan-sc/articleshow/82221416.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Delhi||Residents allege erratic biomedical waste collection||New Delhi: Despite municipal corporations launching helpline numbers for people to get biomedical waste cleared from the households with Covid patients, residents in the city continue to face issues. In some cases, garbage has not been lifted for four to five days even after sending many messages/mails to the department concerned. Fed up with the poor Covid waste management in the area, East Bengal Displaced Persons’ Association, CR Park has written to the South Delhi Municipal Corporation deputy commissioner, district magistrate, area councillor and Delhi Disaster Management Authority seeking their intervention. Secretary of the association PK Paul said that they have been urging the concessionaire and officials concerned for regular lifting of the biomedical waste for the past many days, but to no avail. “It is not even happening on alternate days. As a result, people often mix the hazardous waste with household waste, which increases chances of spread of the infection among others, including waste collectors and local residents. There are at least 200 infected people in the area and for the last five days, our office-bearers have been frequently interacting with the staff of the concessionaire entrusted with the task of lifting the biomedical waste, but without any success,” said PK Paul. “Poor planning and limited equipment are to blame for the situation. There is just one tipper for CR Park, Alaknanada and some other areas, and the number of staff is limited too. Residents are highly dissatisfied,” added Paul. Greater Kailash II residents’ welfare association claimed that the biomedical waste was getting lifted, but only after 3-4 days of complaints being filed. “It seems the corporation staff are overburdened. We tried the helpline number also, but were told that they were receiving hundreds of calls every day and arranging immediate services was impossible. However, they informed us that some more vehicles might be deployed soon,” said Sanjay Rana, president of GK II RWA. At certain places, residents have, however, seen improvement in services in the past one week. “We have distributed yellow bags to residents for keeping the biomedical waste separately. The packet is being lifted by the concessionaire on a daily basis. I think there has been an increase in the number of vehicles also,” said Ruby Makhija of Navjiwan Vihar. A senior South Delhi Municipal Corporation official claimed that 20 new vehicles have been engaged for collection of the biomedical waste. Services improved a lot on Thursday, he said. “A total of 100 kg biomedical waste was lifted from the homes with Covid patients in the last one week. In case of any lapses, people are requested to call at helpline numbers for removal of biomedical waste. These numbers are 8010863863 for Najafgarh, 011-40988800 South Zone, 011-49506548 West Zone and 7290041009 & 7290041008 for Central Zone.” In north Delhi, residents have mixed reactions to the services. Mayor Jai Prakash said that they were taking daily reports from the concessionaire about biomedical waste collection and 687 kg of the waste was collected in a week. “Covid-infected people mixing hazardous waste with regular waste is, however, an issue,” said a north corporation official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/residents-allege-erratic-biomedical-waste-collection/articleshow/82203747.cms||Vibha Sharma

Besides, no effort has been made to communicate the decision to the students. In February last year, KMCLU had entered into a memorandum of understanding with GIDS for offering part-time PhD jointly. Thereafter the applications were invited for the course. The institutes kept on postponing the PhD entrance test and now it has been cancelled by KMCLU, the varsity also cancelled the MoU with GIDS. “Not a single message or email has been sent to the candidates about the cancellation of the course nor the fees have been refunded. Candidates are still confused about whether the admissions will be done or not. I had submitted Rs 3,000 along with an application form with a late fee hoping that since I am a JRF I have good chances to enrol in the course. Not only I had a year of loss but also the scholarship money of my JRF has been wasted. Now both the institutes are mum on whether they will refund application fees or not,” said a candidate Ali. “This PhD process exhausted my 14 months. Last year all academic institutes winded up their admission process by October or so but in the case of this course the last date to apply kept on extending till July and the entrance test scheduled for October was postponed till further notice. It seems they were just interested in collecting money from the candidates and even if they have cancelled the course they should have refunded the application fee,” said a candidate Monisha Tiwari. When contacted KMCLU, its spokesperson Ritu Dang said, “According to the MoU signed between the two institutes, GIDS had to conduct a PhD entrance exam for which the Institute had also collected fees from the applicants. However, due to the continuous delay in the examination, the Executive Council of the University unanimously decided at a meeting held in February to cancel the MoU with Giri Institute and refund the fee of the students. She said the GIDS was also informed in this regard. Keeping view of the student’s interest, Giri Institute must ensure that the fee is refunded at the earliest. “A process has been initiated by the institute to refund fees of the students. An associate professor KS Rao has been given the responsibility to ensure that application form fees of every candidate is refunded,” said GIDS public relation incharge CS Verma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/khwaja-university-giri-institute-cancel-phd-course-around-300-students-in-a-fix/articleshow/82204651.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Pune: Collector calls for oxygen supply from nearby Raigad, instead of Bellary||PUNE: Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh has requested the state government to allot 80 metric tonnes of medical oxygen from the JSW plant in Raigad, instead of Bellary in Karnataka to avoid transportation issues. He also called for supply to be drawn from plants across the district and division. Pune division currently requires 405 tonnes of oxygen. But Deshmukh said supply from Karnataka may prove to be a logistical challenge. “We have asked the state control room to allocate oxygen from the JSW facility at Raigad or send supply from plants in Pune district as we are facing a logistical issue while transporting from Bellary," the collector said. Out of the 405 metric tonnes, maximum allocation is for Pune district, which amounts for 350 metric tonnes. Sangli, Satara, Solapur require about 25-30 MT of oxygen. Deshmukh has also asked all hospitals in urban and rural areas to submit audits of their oxygen use. Last week, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had said the state was in talks with the JSW steel plant at Raigad and Reliance to boost oxygen supply to hospitals. State health minister Rajesh Tope had also said plans are on to set up temporary Covid hospitals at six locations in the state where medical oxygen is produced. The medical oxygen produced at these locations cannot be transported due to lack of bottling facilities, Tope said. These locations are: Pen, Raigad; Thal; Wardha; Khaparkheda, Nagpur; Paras, Akola; and Parli in Beed. Some of these locations have thermal power plants and are producing medical oxygen at a purity of 98%. Temporary facilities with 500 beds would be set up in these six locations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/collector-calls-for-supply-from-nearby-raigad-instead-of-bellary/articleshow/82204652.cms||Nisha Nambiar

It is probably the only case where three brothers were treated at the same time in the state-run hospital. Atul (56) and his younger brother Pankaj (54) and Jitendra (52) showed Covid symptoms in March. They got themselves tested and were found positive of the virus. They had been consulting their family doctor who had advised them to undergo tests. “When we tested positive and Atulbhai needed admission, our doctor suggested that we should admit him to the SSGH. We admitted him on March 27. Eventually, we two had to get admitted on March 30, though we weren’t as serious as our eldest brother,” said Pankaj, adding that they had pay Rs5 each to get their cases registered. “We did not spend a single penny beyond this for our treatment. Food, snacks twice a day, milk and even packed water bottles are provided by the hospital. The cleanliness is good and the staff does its best to treat,” he said. Pankaj and Jitendra stayed in the hospital till April 11. “Since Atulbhai was serious, he had to stay in the hospital till April 18. All of us are doing well after being discharged and are now under home quarantine,” said Pankaj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/3-brothers-beat-ncov-together-at-ssgh/articleshow/82202457.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Panel to act on black marketing of drugs, oxygen||JAIPUR: While incidents of black marketing of Remdesivir and other drugs and oxygen have come into light, the doctors are now alleging that the other medical consumables such as gloves, masks are now being sold at higher prices. On the reports, the health department constituted four-member committee in Jaipur which will work to prevent any black marketing of oxygen and Remdesivir and other medicines such as Tocilizumab and Favipiravir. The four-member committee will conduct inspections at hospitals, drug suppliers and stockists and check the records and stock of the medicines, said Raghu Sharma, health minister. The escalation of serious Covid-19 patients in hospitals for effective clinical management has also resulted in an increase in the demand of Remdesivir which is an investigational therapy drug given in acute and severe versions of Covid-19 where oxygen support is a must. Its rising demand may increase black marketing incidents in the city. For the purpose of preventing such incidents, the committee has been formed. Health secretary Siddharth Mahajan said that the team comprise of Dinesh Kumar Taneja, Komal Roochandani and Manish Kumar Modi from drug controller department and one member of Rajasthan Pharmacy Council, Navin Saanghi. The team will inspect into the complaints of black marketing of medical oxygen and medicines. Due to rising number of Covid-19 patients, a private hospital in the city, which is treating Covid-19 patients, appealed to other hospitals to lend the hospital cylinders, bi pap, ventilators. “We are ready to pay a reasonable rent. Safety of your equipment is my guarantee,” says the officials of the hospital. While reports say that Remdesivir is being sold in black market due to short supply, the Centre has declared that it will supply 26,500vials of Remdesivir from April 1 to April 30. "Prices of consumables such as gloves, masks have gone up. Government should ensure easy availability of such items and drugs to private hospitals. In such pandemic times, black marketing of drugs should be prevented,” said Dr Tarun Patni, president, Jaipur Medical Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/panel-to-act-on-black-marketing-of-drugs-oxygen/articleshow/82203720.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Govt sets up teams under bureaucrats for Cov mgmt||Kolkata: The state on Thursday introduced a Covid management structure to address 16 key aspects, including bed augmentation, oxygen supply, ambulance service, testing and vaccination. The system, involving multiple departments, aims at seamless functioning of the government machinery, optimum use of resources and quicker response to emerging situations with greater accountability. Senior bureaucrats have been entrusted micro-task forces for each field and the overall system will be anchored by the health secretary. During the first wave in 2020, the health and family welfare department managed the situation. But with the sharper spike this time, several other departments have been roped in. “We have put 16 focus areas in the state-level functional grid. Added to it is a territorial grid at district and block levels,” a senior bureaucrat said. Each functional head has a well-defined role to solve a a problem in a field, be it oxygen, bed availability or funeral. For instance, if there is a problem of hospitalisation of a critically ill patient, the focus team will consult the real-time bed status and send the patient to the nearest hospital. In this field, one senior officer is looking after the private and corporate sector and one the government sector. If one focus area is bed augmentation, another area is satellite centre development. “Hotels are being persuaded to convert into hospital satellite units. Once that’s finalised, a medical coordination will be done by supplying hardware and software,” the official said. Senior bureaucrats have also been put at the helm of funeral arrangement . “The current Covid spike entails higher death counts. But our objective is to spare the bereaved further hassles,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/govt-sets-up-teams-under-bureaucrats-for-cov-mgmt/articleshow/82203782.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

---||Goa||Goa Government mismanaged Covid situation: UGDP||MARGAO: United Goans Democratic Party (UGDP) has blamed “mismanagement by the state administration, lackadaisical attitude of law enforcing agencies, poor strategic planning and irresponsible behaviour of the people” for the unprecedented spike of Covid-19 cases in the state. UGDP president Dr Jorson Fernandes in a press note said the current situation was a reflection of the failure of non-medical administrators and politicians in preparing for a disaster. “The largely irresponsible behaviour of the people and the lackadaisical attitude of law enforcing agencies coupled with poor strategic planning is manifested in the high infectivity that we see on our data… The rave parties and allowing hordes of tourists peeping in to Goa without RT-PCR negative certificate has made matters worse,” he said. Expressing his disapproval over the government’s approach in tackling the current phase of the pandemic, Fernandes termed it as being “penny wise, pound foolish”. “To keep the economy going, the government rakes up the money only to spend on the treatment of large number of Covid patients, thus having a negative effect on our resources with hardly any beds available and subsequently, there will be hardly any doctors available, as they too have also started testing positive,” he said. UGDP has called for “proper and careful analysis of the data” and to “matchingly increase the stringent restrictions and to create provisions for augmenting the required infrastructure.” “The government has failed in this regard and the reflection and manifestation of their failure is seen in the data of increased cases and increased deaths. It is time to take mature and logical decisions during this extraordinary pandemic which is especially a more virulent and dangerous second wave,” Fernandes stated in the press note.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-mismanaged-covid-situation-ugdp/articleshow/82204687.cms||---

---||Nagpur||‘Ashamed’ to be a part of this nasty society: HC||Nagpur: Expressing concern over Maharashtra government’s apathy and insensitivity towards helping Covid-19 patients, who’re struggling to get beds, medicines and oxygen, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court slammed authorities for not making efforts to save citizens’ lives. “If you don’t feel ashamed of yourself, then we feel ashamed of being a part of this nasty society. We can’t do anything for the unfortunate patients of Maharashtra. This is how we’re shirking from our responsibilities. You are neglecting and ignoring our patients. We give you solution, you don’t follow it. You do not give us solution. What absolute nonsense is going on here!,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Shreeram Modak orally observed. While hearing a suo motu PIL on beds shortage in afternoon, the judges further noted that their hearts bleed for the hapless patients. “All of us are spending sleepless nights. With folded hands, we request officials to join this fight against the deadly virus,” they said, after failing to get satisfactory response to their orders from the respondents. “The reason for keeping this special hearing at this hour of the night is to provide immediate succour to the Covid patients who are suffering no end in the present situation of scarcity and non-availability of almost every essential service, in sofar as their medical management is concerned,” they added. The bench also flayed the respondents over their inability to ensure oxygen supply to the government and private hospitals terming the scenario as “disappointing”. Earlier, the collector informed that the Nagpur district’s total requirement of oxygen is 166.5 metric tons (MT) and remaining districts in Vidarbha is between 60 and 100 MT, which means the total requirement for the region is of 266.5 MT. “We’re informed that Nagpur has some oxygen generating units and their total capacity to generate is 146MT/day. We have also been told that PRAX AIR (Bhilai) and HYPHEN LINDE had been, till recently, supplying 110MT of liquid oxygen every day. But, now this supply has been reduced to 60MT as per Union health and family welfare ministry’s communication of April 18. The figures would show that there is a shortfall of about 100MT between the demand and supply.” The bench clarified that the hearing is being held for the purpose of making effective rendering of essential services to Covid patients. “Therefore, the concerned authorities wouldn’t take any coercive action against anybody who would be coming to assist the HC, which would be consistent with the SOP and Covid restrictions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ashamed-to-be-a-part-of-this-nasty-society-hc/articleshow/82203749.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Warned CM & DCM of surge 6 months back’||MUMBAI: Six months before the second Covid-19 wave hit the state, veteran bureaucrat Mahesh Zagade said he had “warned” the administration about its likelihood and suggested measures to tackle it. “In my opinion, the administration did not appear to be serious. I had written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and deputy CM Ajit Pawar and submitted a comprehensive action plan for tackling the pandemic, but my pleas fell on deaf ears or the bureaucracy held them back. Even now, I am prepared to offer my expertise for free, but there is no response from the government,” Zagade told TOI on Thursday.  As Pune municipal commissioner, Zagade had tackled the swine flu and as the Food and Drug Administration commissioner from 2011 to 2014, he had insisted on effective implementation of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. “Six months ago, I had a long meeting with the Pune mayor, followed by a letter to the CM and other authorities. If we take stringent measures, it should not be difficult to win the battle against Covid-19,” Zagade said. In a two-page letter to the CM and DCM, Zagade said he had submitted a roadmap for tackling the coronavirus. “A year ago, the CM had shifted a large number of bureaucrats for inept handling of the pandemic situation when there was a spurt in cases. Now, a year later, cases have increased manifold. It clearly indicates the entire exercise of a reshuffle in the bureaucracy was futile,” Zagade said. He blamed the surge in cases on local bodies not exercising their powers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-warned-cm-dcm-of-surge-6-mths-back/articleshow/82202774.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Hospital vacates some to save ICU patients||PUNE: The administration of AIMS hospital in Aundh vacated 20 mild to moderately ill patients needing oxygen support to ensure smooth supply of the essential gas for the people recovering at its intensive care units on Thursday. The administration took the decision owing to the oxygen crunch in the 106-bed Covid hospital. "We were forced to shift 20 Covid patients to ensure that the care of those undergoing treatment in the ICU is not hampered. Patients in ICU need more oxygen. Those who were asked to find beds at bigger facilities were capable enough to commute," said the hospital’s chief executive officer, Ashok Sen. Critical care expert Prasad Rajhans, chief intensivist of Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital, said, “Our daily requirement of medical oxygen has already registered a 10-fold jump. Our huge medical oxygen storage tank, which we needed to fill every week, is not being replenished every day. Anxiety looms whenever the tank lowers to the point where it needs to be immediately replenished.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hosp-vacates-some-to-save-icu-patients/articleshow/82204676.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Ajmer wants oxygen from cement industries in Beawar and Nimbahera||AJMER: With increasing Covid cases in Ajmer, the demand for oxygen and beds is increasing as patients from nearby towns and villages are also coming to JLN Hospital. On Thursday, supply of oxygen was under control, but all ventilator beds were full. The administration is trying to increase around 100 more beds with ventilators in the coming days. There was relief after the state government increased the number of beds for Covid patients in private hospitals. In the last 10 days, over 3,000 patients came to Ajmer and even on Thursday more than 350 patients were put on oxygen. Looking at the requirement in the coming days, the district administration started arranging oxygen from industries. Even the number of beds will be increased and at present there are 553 beds in Covid ward and the administration was arranging more beds with ventilators. Oxygen in-charge and IG of stamp and duty Bhagwat Singh Rathore said on Thursday supply of oxygen was under control and they were trying to get more oxygen cylinders from Shri Cement and also from industries of Nembahera. CEO of zila parishad and in-charge of ICU Gaurav Saini said around 60 to 70 beds in ICU were vacant till Thursday evening, but all ventilator beds were occupied. There are 120 ventilator beds in JLN Hospital in which around 20 to 25 are under maintenance. “Looking at the critical condition, they are increasing about 100 more beds for the patients and a team was working on it,” said Saini. He added that more than 400 calls are coming and they ask people not to panic as things are under control. Meanwhile, there were complaints of injection shortage in Ajmer as relatives of patients admitted to private hospitals were searching to get them. Another team of district administration sealed hotels, marriage gardens and some shops for violating Covid norms. A team on inspection found that a cloth shop on Ramnagar road was closed but there was crowd inside it. The team sealed the shop and imposed fine on the owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ajmer-wants-oxygen-from-cement-industries-in-beawar-and-nimbahera/articleshow/82203758.cms||---
---||Delhi||Oxygen crisis: Delhi HC warns of criminal action||NEW DELHI: A day after it flayed the central government over its handling of the supply of medical-use oxygen in the capital, Delhi High Court instructed all authorities on Thursday to strictly comply with the orders related to oxygen supply or face criminal action. “Non-compliance will be viewed very seriously since non-compliance is likely to result in grave loss of life. We put everyone on notice that non-compliance will invite criminal action,” declared a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli. “The position in Delhi has turned precarious, with several hospitals reporting either complete exhaustion of oxygen or depletion to the level that it may not last for the next few hours.” On Wednesday, the Centre had informed the court that it had increased Delhi’s allocation to 480 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen to help hospitals replenish their dwindling stocks. On Thursday, however, the bench noted, “It appears that the said allocation has actually not been delivered, and the NCT of Delhi has not received medical oxygen to the tune of 480 MT till now.” The order underscored that until Wednesday only 200-250 MT of medical oxygen had been supplied. “It appears that 140 MT of medical oxygen allocated from the plant of Air Liquide in Panipat has been obstructed by the local authorities,” the bench noted. The justices further said, “We direct the central government to peremptorily ensure strict compliance of the Allocation Order dated April 21, 2021, its own order passed on April 22, 2021 under the Disaster Management Act, and our order dated April 21, 2021. We also direct all the authorities concerned, who are bound by the allocation order, and the order passed under the Disaster Management Act, to ensure its strict compliance.” The bench highlighted that non-compliance of the orders and its order passed on Thursday would be dealt with “very seriously” as any non-compliance was likely to result in grave loss of life. It, therefore, directed, “We put everyone concerned on notice that non-compliance of this order would also invite action for contempt of court and also invite criminal and penal action under the Disaster Management Act and under the Indian Penal Code.” The Centre was further ordered to ensure that supplies from all the oxygen producing plants — in accordance with the allocation order — were fulfilled and their transportation wasn’t hindered. “Looking at the present emergent situation, we direct the central government to ensure that adequate security is provided to the lorries transporting oxygen, and there is no obstruction on the way. For this purpose, a special corridor be created for immediate transportation of the oxygen. Other aspects of the matter, which are listed before us, shall continue to be taken up hereafter.” On the issue of availability of medicines, the bench was informed by solicitor general Tushar Mehta that it had to be looked at from the “national perspective”. He said, “Remdesivir cannot be given over the counter.” On augmentation of Covid beds, the government counsel said 4,159 beds had been allocated for Covid patients. Appearing for Delhi government, senior advocate Rahul Mehra pointed out that many of these were normal beds without oxygen or ventilator support and couldn’t be considered as Covid beds. The court noted the Centre's submission that it intended to add more beds for Covid patients. “We hope and expect that the central government will look into the requirement of Covid beds and work to enhance the number in government facilities,” the bench said. The court also came on record that Delhi government hospitals had 7,200 Covid beds with provisions for oxygen, ICU and ventilator, besides 11,029 beds for Covid-19 patients in private hospitals. The Centre suggested that Delhi government could utilise the smaller hospitals and nursing homes to provide treatment to Covid patients as they had trained doctors and other medical staff and only refer the very serious patients to larger facilities. At this point, advocate Prabhsahay Kaur, appearing for petitioner Saroj Super Specialty Hospital, said, “We completely ran out of liquid medical oxygen. The oxygen cylinders only work for a few minutes. As soon as the court took up the matter, INOX (supplier) was able to supply gas for 25-30 hours. It would not only help those who are admitted but the hospital could now take in more patients.” Advocate Viksit Arora intervened to reveal that his client, Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute, had oxygen supply for only a couple of hours. “There are 220 Covid patients in the hospital. Yesterday we had 235, but today we couldn't admit any more patients because of oxygen,” said Arora. Taking note, the high court directed Sri Balaji to contact the Delhi government-appointed nodal officer. Saroj Hospital also offered to help with oxygen supply. “We appreciate this gesture,” the bench remarked. At the end of the hearing, the court remarked, “Oxygen from Panipat should have reached by now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/oxygen-crisis-hc-warns-of-criminal-action/articleshow/82203757.cms||Aamir Khan

According to Sambhal police, the SHO had tested positive for Covid-19 following which he was admitted to a Covid facility in the district four days ago. However, hospital authorities said that the patient needs plasma urgently. Sambhal police has been requesting people to donate plasma and has also shared a contact number among media groups, seeking assistance. Sambhal SP Chakresh Mishra said the SHO's health condition has deteriorated over a couple of days and doctors at the Covid centre, where the cop has been undergoing treatment, have said that he needs plasma. "So, we have been appealing to people who have recovered from Covid-19, to donate plasma, and for this, we have made available a contact number '78398-60070',” the SP added. The plasma therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from Covid-19 and transfusing those into a Covid patient to help kick-start the immune system to fight the infection. More than 50 police personnel, including head constables, constables, have contracted Covid-19 in Sambhal and are either admitted in the Covid hospitals or quarantined at homes. Notably, as many as seven police personnel, including a sub-inspector, head constables and constables deputed at Hayatnagar police station, were recently tested positive for Covid following which the police station was shut for 48 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/sambhal-police-appeals-for-urgent-plasma-donation-as-covid-ve-cops-health-worsens/articleshow/82200967.cms||Maria Khan

The cylinders were donated in the presence of Barmer MLA Mewaram Jain, officiating district collector Mohandas Ratnu and other officers and public representatives. It is to be mentioned that during the corona period last year the family of the late philanthropist had helped people with open hands by providing ration items, food and other facilities. Recently due to technical problems at the oxygen plant in the government hospital, the oxygen generation got stopped. Looking at this Jogendra Chauhan and Rajendra Chauhan, sons of late Tan Singh Chauhan, too pledge that people in Barmer should not die due to shortage of oxygen. Therefore, they donated 500 big oxygen cylinders to Barmer medical college. Jogendra said that whenever required, oxygen will be provided. Rajendra and Jogendra said that these days people are running from pillar to post to get oxygen. In government hospitals too there was a problem in oxygen generation plants so they decided to give 500 oxygen cylinders to the district administration as the requirement for oxygen may increase in coming days. They said that whenever the administration needs them they will be always ready. In this hour of crisis, they are just fulfilling their duty. Officiating collector Ratnu said that daily 350 oxygen cylinders are being generated at the oxygen plant in the hospital, which is fulfilling the current demand and today philanthropist Tan Singh Chauhan’s family gave 500 oxygen cylinders, which is a big lifesaver at this hour. He said the family has taken the responsibility of refilling the cylinders when it gets empty, which is really unique. He appealed the philanthropists to come ahead along with the government so that they can extend help in overcoming this pandemic. He said the district administration is making efforts to get a liquid oxygen tanker for the medical college, which will help in resolving a big problem. According to MLA Jain, the situation of medical colleges in Barmer is better and along with the government philanthropists are coming ahead. Today Jogendra and Rajendra gave 500 oxygen cylinders, which is really a big relief at this hour. He appealed other philanthropists to come ahead so that no one loses life due to lack of treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/philanthropists-family-donates-500-o2-cylinders-in-barmer/articleshow/82203775.cms||Vimal Bhatia

Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty accepted the request of the high court bar association, Jaipur to treat its letter highlighting the plight of Covid patients and the situation arising out of shortage in hospitals into a PIL. Association president Bhuvnesh Sharma and Giriraj Sharma in the letter said all the hospitals in the state are witnessing shortage of oxygen in the last couple of days. According to media reports, the hospitals are facing shortage of life saving oxygen during this pandemic in comparison to demand leading to deaths while the demand for oxygen is increasing day by day. Instead of addressing the problem, both the state and the Centre are indulging in a blame game accusing the other for the shortage. Since the state and Centre are being ruled by different political parties and due to lack of coordination between the two, the people of the state are bearing the brunt. They demanded that in such a situation it called upon the judiciary to intervene in this matter and direct both the governments to ensure sufficient supply of oxygen to the hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-to-hear-pil-on-oxygen-shortage-today/articleshow/82203764.cms||---

He urged the Centre to ensure smooth supply even if that requires deployment of paramilitary forces. “The reason behind the limited supply even today is the Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments have created a jungle raj to stop oxygen supply from reaching Delhi. Delhi government officials have tried to talk to the Uttar Pradesh and Haryana governments but the situation remains the same. Our tankers are standing outside and only tankers from the Haryana government are being allowed to enter the plant in Haryana,” Sisodia said. Delhi only received 177 metric tonnes of oxygen instead of its quota of 378 metric tonnes on Wednesday. Delhi’s quota has now been hiked to 480 metric tonnes. For hospitals that have exhausted all oxygen, Delhi government has made a makeshift arrangement. Sisodia also wrote to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan alleging that tankers carrying oxygen to Delhi were unable to reach city hospitals because officials from the Haryana and Uttar Pradesh administrations and police were sitting in the oxygen plants in these states to stop the supply meant for Delhi. “I request you to ensure that the oxygen allocated for Delhi by the Centre reaches the capital without any delay for saving the lives of the patients admitted in Delhi’s hospitals,” Sisodia wrote. Meanwhile, Aam Aadmi Party legislator Saurabh Bharadwaj, who is admitted to a hospital with Covid, released a video from his bed, wearing an oxygen mask and gasping for breath. “The hospital in which I am admitted has only three hours of oxygen left. A lot of people are dependent on oxygen and, without enough oxygen, they will die like fish die outside water. It is a time for all to come together to work,” said Bharadwaj. Earlier in the day, Sisodia said there was a fight for oxygen supply because even after the increase in Delhi’s quota, some states were stopping the supply. “Several hospitals in Delhi now see a dearth of oxygen supply. There is no oxygen left anymore. I have received many messages from hospitals — Saroj Hospital, Rathi Hospital, UK Hospital, Jeevan Hospital, etc, have informed they don’t have any oxygen,” he said, adding that Delhi government had been arranging cylinders for these and many other hospitals. “Internal arrangements are makeshift arrangements, which are not long-term solutions,” he added. The majority of Delhi’s hospitals are reporting an acute shortage of oxygen due to hospitalisation of serious Covid-19 patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jungle-raj-stopping-o2-supply-sisodia/articleshow/82203770.cms||AlokKNMishra

There is no availability of beds, while 38 non-oxygen beds, 54 oxygen beds (other than ICU) are available for patients in the district. Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Jasjeet Kaur said 40 oxygen beds are being added at the Sector 6 civil hospital. She stated that the facility of ventilators will be increased in private hospitals. The CMO said the dedicated Covid-19-care centre (DCCC) running at BRS Dental College having only non-oxygen beds will also be prepared on the patterns based on the requirement in future. While providing details of active patients in the district, the CMO said there are a total of 2,487 active cases in the Panchkula district, of which 2,337 are under home isolation, while 129 are at the dedicated Covid-19 hospital centre (DCHC)), 32 under DCCC and 144 are under dedicated Covid-19 hospital (DCH). Haryana chief minister (CM) also took a meeting with all the deputy commissioners of the district across the state and ordered them to prepare themselves to avoid shortage of oxygen beds. Additional deputy commissioner (ADC) Mohammad Imran Raza directed the CMO to make sure 50% of all the beds at private hospitals are reserved for Covid-19 patients referred by the civil hospital on priority basis. On April 19, 30% beds were reserved and now with the spike in the cases, the reserve beds have been increased to 50%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/all-oxygen-icu-beds-ventilators-occupied/articleshow/82202778.cms||Arvind Bishnoi
---||Lucknow||UP BJP sets up district wise helplines for Covid patients||LUCKNOW: As coronavirus surge continues in the state, the Uttar Pradesh BJP on Thursday decided to ramp up relief measures by issuing districtwise helpline numbers where people may contact for medical aid at local level. Party sources said the district-level helpline numbers would be routed to the party’s district president, general secretary or a member of the medical wing, who will be a doctor. The move came a day after the party issued a state-level helpline number which also coordinates with district functionaries. UP BJP general secretary Govind Shukla said the district-level numbers have been passed down the line to divisional and booth level functionaries who have been asked to keep a close vigil in their respective areas and help people as and when required. Sources said the steps are being taken to keep tabs on rural and other remote areas which often do not have strong medical infrastructure. “If a party functionary comes across a case of Covid-19, he informs the district-level team which provides immediate medical aid. Workers have also been asked to provide all possible help to affected people in getting them admitted to hospitals,” Shukla said. Party sources said vigil had been stepped up in districts bordering other states amid return of migrants from other states like Maharashtra. The decision to start state-level and districtwise phone helplines, sources said, was taken after consultation with top BJP brass including party national president JP Nadda. “Party workers had chipped in during the first wave of coronavirus and provided relief to migrants who returned to the state in large numbers following nationwide lockdown. The second wave is posing a grave threat to people who need to be looked after by the party,” a BJP leader. Shukla said 95% of complaints received on the state helpline in the last 24 hours were from Lucknow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-bjp-sets-up-district-wise-helplines-for-covid-patients/articleshow/82204684.cms||---
---||India||Muslim pandit and Sanskrit scholar Pandit Ghulam Dastagir Birajdar passes away||MUMBAI: Pandit Ghulam Dastagir Birajdar, a noted Muslim pandit, a Sanskrit scholar and chairman of the committee to prepare school textbooks for Sanskrit in Maharashtra, died of brain hemorrhage on Thursday. He was 87. He was laid to rest at his hometown Solapur, said his grandson Shahid Shaikh. Known for his crusade against communalism and promotion of communal harmony, Pandit Birajdar was among half a dozen Muslim pandits in the country whose knowledge of Sanskrit earned them accolades. As former general secretary of the Vishwa Sanskrit Pratishthan in Varanasi and a certified pandit who also received a citation from former President Dr K R Narayanan, he was invited to give lectures to Sanskrit scholars and students at Benares Hindu University and other institutions. He retired as a Sanskrit teacher from a school in Mumbai and lived in Worli. “Language has no religion and no community has a divine right to learn any language. It is a wrong notion that only Brahmins should learn Sanskrit just as it is equally wrong to believe only Muslims should learn Arabic,” Pandit Birajdar had told TOI in an interview earlier. As a child, Pandit Birajdar had told TOI, every day he would pass by his village school where students learnt Sanskrit. One day he went up to the Brahmin teacher and told him: “I am a Muslim. Will you teach me too?” The teacher immediately enrolled him and that’s how Birajdar went on to become one of the leading Muslim Sanskrit scholars.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/muslim-pandit-and-sanskrit-scholar-pandit-ghulam-dastagir-birajdar-passes-away/articleshow/82206663.cms||Mohammed Wajihudin

Cylinders will be supplied free to government hospitals and other needy hospitals too. This process will help to mitigate hardship of the requirement of medical oxygen during the pandemic. A similar plant is being set up by KribhCo’s 100% subsidiary, KribhCo Fertilizers Limited (KFL) at Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh, which will start supplying free oxygen to various hospitals within the next 21 days,” said an official statement.To mitigate the hardship, on behalf opf KribhCo, it chairman and former MP, Dr Chandra Pal Singh, also contributed a sum of Rs 1 crore to Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/kribhco-to-provide-free-o2-to-govt-hospitals-from-hazira-plant/articleshow/82202812.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Delhi getting 175 tonnes extra oxygen from UP’s quota: Govt||Lucknow: Cabinet minister and UP government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh rebuffed Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia’s claim that UP was not supplying oxygen to Delhi. Contradicting the claim, Singh said on Thursday that UP’s quota had actually been curtailed to provide additional 175 tonnes of oxygen to Delhi and the latter should be grateful for it. “This is a false allegation. Sisodia wants to be a bully, but is crying like a child. His statement is totally opposite of the truth. Delhi is being provided with oxygen from UP’s quota,” he said. Singh said UP was getting 149 tonnes of oxygen from the plant in Modinagar from where it is now getting only 80 tonnes. Supply from Roorkee is down from 40 tonnes to 15 tonnes while the entire 40 tonnes from Panipat is being sent to Delhi. “Delhi is getting 175 tonnes more oxygen than its quota, but UP is neither crying about this, nor raising any objections because our objective is to save lives. The Delhi government is making these allegations to divert attention from its failures. It should be grateful to us for giving them oxygen from our quota,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/delhi-getting-175-tonnes-extra-oxygen-from-ups-quota-govt/articleshow/82204706.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Doctor-babu set up oxygen unit after cases eased last Sept||MUMBAI: Nandurbar collector Dr Rajendra Bharud got down to setting up a liquid oxygen plant in the district just days after Covid-19 cases began to decline in September 2020. “In the wake of the pandemic, there were 190 patients in the district. I realised , there was a possibility that cases could once again rise and that we should have an oxygen plant in place. So, we set up a plant with a capacity of 600 litre per minute,” said the medical professional turned bureaucrat. Bharud, a product of the KEM Hospital and Seth G S Medical College, said true to his fears, after the second Covid-19 wave hit the state, the tribal Nandurbar district reported as many as 1,210 cases in a single day. “We felt that one oxygen plant was not enough. We then mobilised funds and set up two more plants in the civil hospital. Now, the total capacity will be 1,800 litre per minute. In addition, we will get 600 litre per minute from private oxygen producers. Further, we will add another 600 litre per minute from own resources. In that event, our total capacity will be 3,000 litre per minute,” Bharud said. Bharud, an IAS officer of the 2013 batch, said he wishes to ensure no patient suffers for want of oxygen. “Each plant cost us around Rs 85 lakh. The funds come from the district planning and development and the state disaster relief fund.” A senior bureaucrat said Bharud has shown the way to the entire public health department and now several district collectors have approached the government to similarly set up oxygen plants. “Bharud swung into action at the most appropriate time and before the acute shortage of oxygen was felt,” he said, adding in recent past, the central government has proposed 10 oxygen plants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-doc-babu-set-up-o2-unit-after-cases-eased-last-sept/articleshow/82202802.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Jaipur||Cops seize 35 oxygen cylinders in Kota, 2 held||KOTA: Amid rising consumption of oxygen by Corona positive patients in hospitals, Kota rural police on Wednesday night arrested two youths from Ramganj Mandi town of Kota district for allegedly black marketing of cylinders. Police seized 35 oxygen cylinders from their pick-up vehicle. The police booked the two youths under sections of Essential Commodity Act and initiated further investigation into the matter. On the tip-off of oxygen cylinders being delivered by a pick-up vehicle at various shops in Ramganj Mandi town on Wednesday night, the police chased the vehicle and found it loaded with oxygen cylinders, SHO at Ramganj Mandi police station Harish Bharti said. He said, on inquiry, the two persons, identified as Jakir and Nanej Maratha, both residents of Ramganj Mandi town, could not reply satisfactorily on the oxygen cylinders with them nor they could produce papers regarding loading and destination of delivery of the cylinders, following which the police arrested the accused and booked them under sections of Essential Aommodity Act, he further said. The police also seized at least 35 oxygen cylinders from the Pickup vehicle, which was also taken under police custody, he added. Initial inquiry into the matter revealed cylinders were loaded in the pick-up vehicle in Chittorgarh for the delivery for Covid patients at Jhalawar Medical College, but instead, the accused delivered them at various private shops at high price in Ramganj Mandi town, the SHO said. Further investigation into the matter is underway and the police are at high alert to check such type of black marketing of essential commodities in the critical times of pandemic, DSP and circle officer of Ramganj Mandi Netrapal Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cops-seize-35-oxygen-cylinders-in-kota-2-held/articleshow/82203783.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Bank of oxygen generating units in Jodhpur soon||JODHPUR: Some philanthropists of the city have come together to make a bank of portable oxygen generating units amid the growing crisis of life-saving gas in the city. These units will be provided for home use to those who have low oxygen saturation, but are in a medical condition requiring them to be hospitalised so that the pressure on hospital beds could be reduced and as many beds as possible could be kept for only those patients who have an urgency of hospitalisation. The team has planned to make a bank of 500 such machines to deal with the crisis time and approval for close to 200 machines has already been given by about 40 persons contributing from at least one unit to as many as one could wish. AP Gaur, who has contributed in this benevolent mission, said that the process of acquisition of the machines was under process and expressed hope that the machines will be reaching Jodhpur in next two to three days. “These machines have been agreed upon to be provided to the needy ones at a nominal charge of Rs 100 per day,” Gaur said adding 10 such machines have already been obtained. Earlier, they had agreed on five-litre capacity but following deliberations and consistent requirement of the oxygen for the patients, the team is also mulling over having the machines with 10-litre capacity in order to make it more useful for the purpose. Each machine will be costing about Rs 60,000-70,000 for 10-litre capacity which is not possible for every person to manage for personal use at home. This noble gesture will help many such persons who have been struggling hard to secure a bed in hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bank-of-oxygen-generating-units-in-jodhpur-soon/articleshow/82203780.cms||---
---||Kolkata||New Covid cases at nearly 12,000; 40% from Kolkata, North 24 Parganas||KOLKATA: The daily spike in Covid cases continued to break the record on Thursday, when the state recorded another all-time high of 11,948 new cases with 56 deaths during the past 24 hours. Around 40% of the cases were reported from Kolkata — 2,646 cases — and North 24 Parganas, with 2,372 cases. With an extremely infectious mutant on the prowl, health experts apprehend the onslaught will continue its relentless march for a while. “Going by this sharp upsurge, the number of daily new cases will breach the 20,000-mark in a week. This is a tsunami and the destruction is unlikely to come to a halt any time soon,” said a virologist attached with a state institute. While the first wave had spared a majority of the younger population, the second wave is causing ripples among the group, including children. “The number of patients requiring oxygen support is higher this time and a higher number of younger patients are getting infected unlike last time,” said infectious diseases specialist Yogiraj Ray, who is involved in the treatment of Covid patients at Infectious Diseases and Beliaghata General Hospital, the state’s nodal hospital for Covid care. On April 1, there were 6,519 active cases across Bengal and 2,519 in Kolkata. In three weeks, the numbers have shot up to 68,798 and 17,778 respectively. The steep spike has left the healthcare system gasping with all major hospitals struggling with an overload of patients. “During the first wave, a section of the patients who did not require hospitalization had come to the hospital due to social pressure. But this time, most patients coming in are quite unwell. Around 80%-90% are in need of oxygen support compared to the 60%-70% during the first wave,” said Chandramouli Bhattacharya, tropical medicine specialist at Peerless Hospital. “The ratio of older patients vis-a vis younger ones, which was 80:20 during the first wave, has changed to 60:40 now,” Bhattacharya said. Over the past two days, the number of daily tests in the state has gone up to a little above 50,000 from 40,000-46,000. Health experts said even this number is too low. “Scaling up tests to identify and isolating the infected as fast as possible is a step towards containing the spread of the virus. But we are not testing enough. The state must push all RT-PCR laboratories to full capacity and include other methods of tests without fear of detecting more positive cases,” said a doctor attached with a state hospital. The hospital occupancy rate was only about 10% in the beginning of April. On Thursday, it had risen to nearly 50% overall. But most hospitals in Kolkata had occupancy ranging from 80%-100%. On Thursday, the state health department got senior doctors — tropical medicine specialist Bibhuti Saha, medicine specialist Jyotirmoy Pal and Soumitra Ghosh and critical-care specialist Sugata Das Gupta — to train medical officers and nurses from different Covid hospitals. The online session had the specialists teaching them how to care for patients in the wards and in HUD and ICUs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-cases-at-nearly-12k-40-from-kol-n-24-pgns/articleshow/82202798.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Kolkata hospitals add 900 beds but can’t keep up with patient numbers||KOLKATA: In three days, private hospitals in the city have added a little over 900 beds for Covid care. But with almost all beds occupied within hours as demand outstrips supply, the crisis continues. The steep rise in Covid-19 cases and the resultant jump in active case count has left hospitals flooded with calls from patients and families seeking a bed. “We are getting close to 250 calls a day seeking beds. This includes calls to the hospital landline number as well as to personal numbers of employees. They are being counselled while we prioritize the rest to offer a bed as and when it is available,” said Subhasish Datta, chief general manager (operations) at Ruby General Hospitals. The hospital has already added 10 beds this week and is planning to add 20 more critical care beds in the next few days. Currently, all 100 beds in the hospital are occupied. Even as Medica Superspecialty Hospital put in 50 more beds to take the Covid-19 bed count to 214, including 135 ICU beds, there was no vacancy on Thursday evening. “The pressure for beds is tremendous. No matter how many beds one adds, it gets exhausted in a matter of hours. We should be able to add 20 more beds in the next couple of days,” said Alok Roy, chairman of Medica Group of Hospitals. CMRI has 30 patients on the waiting list and calls from Covid-positive patients seeking a bed continue to pour in. The hospital has added 30 beds a couple of days ago. Its occupancy is full at present. “What we need is more critical care and high dependency beds. We are trying to scale up more of these beds over the next few days,” said Simmardeep Gill, COO of CK Birla Hospitals CMRI. Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences has added 50 beds to take the tally to 161. All its 95 CCU beds are full. “Of the 50 beds added, 35 were taken up within 24 hours. We are trying to extend our satellite facility capacity to 50 beds from 32 so that we can accommodate some more patients who can be monitored there,” said Narayana Health zonal director (East) R Venkatesh. On Thursday, word went around in social media that a unit was going to be added to AMRI Hospitals, Mukundapur, by afternoon and that people who needed bed could contact the hospital. Even before the ward was opened, 30 people had already called to book the beds. The scene at government Covid facilities is no different. Even as the state health department has centralised the admission process, hospitals continues to get patients knocking on hospital doors. “We added 50 more beds on Wednesday and most got filled up. Right now, we have 315 beds and the occupancy is almost full,” said Asis Manna, medical superintendent and vice-principal of Beliaghata ID Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hospitals-add-900-beds-but-cant-keep-up-with-patient-numbers/articleshow/82202801.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

He later shot himself dead with a revolver at the woman’s house. The incident took place near Irshagarh crossing under Mainather police limits when the woman’s husband was away for work. Moradabad police said that the incident occurred in front of the woman's 11-year-old daughter. Her daughter told the cops that the man barged into the house following which her mother ran for cover but he caught her and stabbed her multiple times and later shot himself. Police said it seems the woman knew the accused and there may have been some dispute between the two. A case has been registered and a probe has been initiated, the police added. Both the deceased were residents of Irshagarh. The place is situated near the Moradabad-Sambhal highway, and comes under the Mainather police station. Superintendent of police (Rural Areas), Moradabad, Vidya Sagar Mishra said, “A man killed a local woman at her house when the latter’s husband, a labourer, was away for work. Families and relatives are being questioned to ascertain how the woman knew the accused. Prima facie, it appears that the woman already knew the man and due to some ongoing dispute, the man, in a fit of rage, killed her and then shot himself too.” The SP (Rural) added, “Forensic experts were called in for collection of evidence and the bodies have been sent for a postmortem examination. The reports are awaited.” Mainather SHO Ramvir Singh told TOI, “An FIR has been registered against the deceased man under sections 302 (punishment for murder) and 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) of the IPC. The accused lived alone as her wife died a few years ago. He had a daughter who is married and lives with her in-laws." The SHO added, "The woman is survived by her husband and five children, including the 11-year-old girl, who witnessed the crime on Wednesday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-stabs-woman-multiple-times-in-front-of-her-minor-daughter-later-shoots-self/articleshow/82200979.cms||Maria Khan

A new set of workers has now been temporarily assigned to the affected areas till the old workers recover. The garbage collection system had taken a hit in blocks like AE, FD, BD and a few others with the conservancy staffers not turning up to remove the daily domestic waste. Civic officials, however, said the complaints were isolated and not large-scale. They claimed the services have already been regularized. But there were still some hiccups in some places on Wednesday and Thursday, when conservancy workers turned up later in the day than usual. “The garbage collectors did not come on Sunday or Monday. It was only after one of the Block residents informed the civic authorities that a conservancy worker arrived,” said a resident of AE Block. “The garbage collectors came on Thursday, but much later, around 9am. Usually they collect the garbage very early in the morning,” said a resident of BL Block.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/waste-collection-hit-after-civic-staff-fall-ill-in-salt-lake/articleshow/82202832.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Her land was acquired by the TNHB in 1983.The TNHB acquired land belonging to V Saraswathiammal of Avarampalayam on September 7, 1983. The government fixed Rs 200 per cent as compensation.Saraswathiammal approached a lower court for higher compensation and the court ordered the TNHB to pay Rs 6,000 per cent to the elderly woman in 2005. However, TNHB authorities went for an appeal before the Madras high court, which fixed Rs 2,000 per cent.However, Saraswathiammal moved the Supreme Court against the Madras high court’s order. The apex court set aside the high court order and confirmed the lower court’s order of Rs 6,000 per cent. The Supreme Court ordered the TNHB to pay Rs 67.87 lakh to Saraswathiammal before March 31, 2021.The TNHB authorities failed to deposit the amount and the elderly woman approached the second additional sub-ordinate judge court.The court on Wednesday ordered to attach furniture, clocks, telephones, cars and other movable properties from the offices of the Coimbatore district collector, district revenue officer (DRO), revenue divisional officer (RDO) and district treasury.The court also ordered to seal the office of the executive engineer of TNHB at Tatabad in the city.According to sources, the court order was brought to the notice of district collector S Nagarajan who instructed the TNHB officials to take immediate steps to provide the compensation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/court-orders-attachment-of-movable-properties-at-district-collectorate/articleshow/82203794.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Fear of price hike, shortage leads to longer vaccine queues in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Fear of getting infected during the second wave and apprehension that the vaccine supply may run dry has triggered long queues at vaccination centres across the city. Additionally, there is the lurking suspicion that vaccine prices for even those in the 45-plus category may shoot up at private vaccination centres after May 1. But with supply still erratic at some centres, a section of people had to return home without the shot on Thursday. “Till even a couple of weeks ago, we had to mobilize people to take the vaccine. Now there is a sudden rise in the number of people coming on their own to get inoculated,” said community medicine specialist Sanjib Bandyopadhyay, vaccination site supervisor at Infectious Diseases and Beliaghata General Hospital. Queues are getting longer at the KMC clinics following reports of vaccine shortage at private hospitals. According to a KMC health department official, the supply of vaccine doses was gradually improving and, accordingly, the civic brass was rationalizing the supply to the civic body’s vaccination clinics ward-wise. “The footfall at our vaccination centre has increased. Since the supply chain has improved, we are able to offer it to about 300 recipients a day,” said Subhasish Datta, chief general manager operations at Ruby General Hospitals. Sources in the KMC confirmed that several civic clinics in the added areas were witnessing heavy rush. On Thursday, KMC vaccination clinics in Kasba and Garfa had on spot registration and administered doses to 300 people. At the Atabagan clinic in Garia, 192 people were vaccinated. “We are now running over 130 vaccination clinics across the city. That will soon increase to 144 and cover all wards. As the supply of vaccines is gradually improving, we are covering more citizens with the vaccination programme,” a KMC health department senior official said. However, some vaccination centres are refusing people due to a dwindling stock. At Bansdroni, the KMC paramedics could register 125 local residents, asking others to return the next day. At a KMC clinic in Bhowanipore, no more than 100 people could be registered for vaccination on Thursday. “We did not get any doses on Thursday. Since we had to carry out the drive from our remaining stock, we restricted administering the first dose to only 100 people while the rest was offered to people coming for the second dose. Hopefully, our stock will be replenished by Friday,” said Bandyopadhyay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fear-of-price-hike-shortage-leads-to-longer-vax-queues/articleshow/82202805.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

With regard to the prevailing “critical situation”, the under-trial prisoners staying in crowded correctional homes may need to be shifted to less crowded ones to ensure “equal distribution”, said the Bombay high court order. Applications in this regard submitted to a magistrate need to be considered within “48 hours”, said the court. There are over 35,000 inmates in 47 prisons across the state while the actual capacity is a little over 23,000. The HC bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni was hearing a suo motu PIL to tackle the spike in Covid cases in prisons.

---||Delhi||Delhi to airlift oxygen from Odisha||NEW DELHI: Delhi is planning to bring oxygen from Odisha by air so that the supply shortage can be immediately met. In a press conference, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the capital’s quota of oxygen has been increased from 378 metric tonnes to 480 metric tonnes and there was an urgent need for all states to work together for ensuring the required oxygen supply to the states in need. “The newly increased quota of oxygen is going to be supplied primarily from Odisha. This consignment will take some time to reach Delhi. We are trying our best to airlift oxygen to cut down on the time it takes,” Kejriwal said. Kejriwal received a call from Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik on Thursday morning who assured complete support to Delhi in facilitating lifting of the city’s quota of oxygen. Kejriwal thanked him for the gesture. He also spoke to Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar and sought his support in facilitating transport of oxygen trucks to Delhi. He tweeted that the Haryana CM has assured full support. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia and health minister Satyendar Jain are in constant touch with officials trying to ensure that the entire process moves smoothly. “Delhi government has spent a number of sleepless nights trying to arrange for oxygen in hospitals and other Covid care centres to try and ensure that no patient suffers because of its absence. The central government fixes a specific quota of oxygen for every state. It had earlier capped our quota at 378 tonnes, yesterday they increased it to 480 tonnes. Even though we require more oxygen, we are extremely grateful to the central government for increasing our oxygen supply. The central government also decides the company that will supply oxygen to the states. Delhi does not have any production centres. Our entire supply of oxygen comes from companies based in other states. The problem that has arisen here is because they say that they wish to use the oxygen in their own states,” Arvind Kejriwal said at the press conference. Some states in which oxygen plants are based are not allowing oxygen cylinders to come to Delhi, he said further. “If we decide to split ourselves into Haryana, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, West Bengal...India will not survive. We need to unite as Indians, as human beings. We don’t want to see news of states stopping trucks coming to Delhi, going to MP, etc. We want to see news that shows us how Delhi helped another state overcome their crisis, how Uttar Pradesh helped in doing so,” Kejriwal added. “If we have surplus medicines, oxygen and other supplies, we will send them to states that need them. When Covid subsides in Delhi and doctors are required in other states, we will send them. Covid doesn’t recognise borders,” said Kejriwal. The chief minister said the state government was trying to use the weeklong lockdown to overcome the shortage of oxygen, beds, etc, in the capital and to strengthen the health infrastructure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-to-airlift-oxygen-from-odisha/articleshow/82203793.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Lucknow||CM: Shortage of beds, meds shows slackness of officials||Lucknow: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday vented his anger against officials of the health department for their slackness in management of medical facilities when the second wave of Covid-19 struck. The slackness, he said, resulted in shortage of medicines and beds in hospitals. A government spokesperson said the CM had made sweeping changes at the top in 2020 when similar ‘carelessness’ was shown by some doctors and officials. Dr DK Aneja, principal of Sarojini Naidu Medical College in Agra was removed and replaced by Dr Sanjay Kala, head, department of general surgery in Kanpur Medical College. Dr RC Gupta, principal of Meerut Medical College was replaced by Dr SK Garg, head of department of community medicine. The CM has indicated that similar strict action will again be taken against doctors who do not work properly. Meanwhile, the CM said that Centre has allocated 1,22,000 vials of remdesivir injection to Uttar Pradesh. Pharmaceuticals companies Cadila and Cipla will provide around 1 lakh vials each, Jubilant will supply 50,000 vials and Mylin 25,000 vials. CM also reviewed the preparations for doubling the number of beds in 10 districts. He said beds should be increased in KGMU and Balrampur hospital in Lucknow, and in private hospitals in Prayagraj, Varanasi and Kanpur. There were as many as 82,880 containment zones across the state by Thursday evening. The chief minister said the rules of containment zones should be enforced very strictly. All movement to and from these areas should be restricted entirely to contain further spread of infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-shortage-of-beds-meds-shows-slackness-of-officials/articleshow/82204734.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Airfares to US, UK more than triple during Covid wave II||MUMBAI: Even as countries have begun closing borders to India, the rush to fly out has airfares on flights out of metros like Mumbai and Delhi to New York, London and San Francisco jump to breathtaking heights. On Thursday, the cheapest one-way fare from Mumbai or Delhi to New York for travel this weekend (April 23) started at Rs 1.44 lakh on an Air India flight. For travel next week, say on April 29, the cheapest was Rs 1.50 lakh for travel from Mumbai on a non-stop flight, while it was Rs60,000 for a 20-hour flight with a transit halt. Advance purchase ticket, say for one-way travel from Mumbai to Newark, on, say May 15, started at Rs60,000. But with uncertainty over whether flights from India will be banned by US by then, it’s not a viable option now. The cheapest one-way fare to San Francisco began at over Rs 1 lakh for travel next week, on long duration transit flights. A travel agent said, “Airfares on flights to US and UK have more than tripled with the second Covid wave hitting India hard. Add to that uncertainty over whether these countries will ban flights from India in the coming days, and that leaves passengers with no choice but to book 24-48 hour advance purchase tickets.” That is the problem facing students who have booked to fly to UK in May. UK will add India to its ‘red list’ of countries at 8.30am on Friday. A note sent by Virgin Atlantic to travel agents said, “Entry to UK is banned to all but UK and Irish nationals and residents, who must undertake 10-day managed hotel quarantine upon arrival…” The airline added that it was reviewing its schedule of India operations from April 23 and recommended that customers booked to travel to or from India with them check their flight status. A travel industry official said, “A lot of students booked to fly out next week, but with uncertainty, many decided to reschedule flights to this week and land before the red list deadline. The problem is they have to pay a hefty fare difference, apart from change fee.’’ The cheapest one-way Mumbai-London ticket for non-stop travel on Friday started at Rs99,000 on Virgin Atlantic on a flight that beat the red list deadline. But for travel on Saturday, there were no practical options. The cheapest fare was on Vistara for Rs 1.12 lakh for a 24-hour flight with a transit in Delhi. Not that the going is good for people planning to escape to tourist destinations. On Thursday evening, Seychelles announced that only vaccinated visitors from India who have completed two weeks after their second dose can enter the archipelago. Those aged below 18 have been exempted. “All visitors irrespective of vaccination status will have to present a negative PCR test report taken maximum 72 hours prior to departure,” said a Seychelles tourism spokesperson. The cheapest foreign destination was Dubai, with one-way fares from Mumbai at Rs8,000, for travel on Friday. “But that is because Dubai demands a PCR test taken within 48 hours of departure, but currently labs take longer to give a report, and that has been a dampener,’’ said a travel industry insider. On Thursday evening, Emirates airline announced suspension of flights from India for 10 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-airfares-to-us-uk-more-than-triple-during-covid-wave-ii/articleshow/82204764.cms||Manju V

The accused were arrested from Eklingpura Chouraha while they were trying to sell a vial for Rs 35,000 against an MRP of Rs 899. Police said the men had sold 46 vials in the past three days at exorbitant prices. They told police that they purchased the vials from an employee of the government MB hospital. The accused are being interrogated and police believe they could be a part of a larger network of black marketers across the division. Additional SP Gopal Swaroop Mewara said the accused were identified as Dr Mohammad Abir Khan, 27, son of Mohd Afzal Khan, resident of Savina and Mohit, 21, son of Shantilal Patidar of Chikhli in Dungarpur. The Special Task Force had been getting tips of people black-marketting the injection and hence an undercover cop called the accused as a bogus customer and said that he was in urgent need for the vial. The doctor demanded Rs 35,000 and refused for any consideration on price claiming that he got the vials for Rs 23,000 each. When the cop agreed, the doctor called him at Eklingpura Chouraha and as he handed the vial to the plain clothed cop, the police team arrested him. The MBBS student, too, had accompanied the doctor and stood some meters away to guard the deal. During interrogation, the accused told the police that they got the vials from one Chirag Kalal who charged Rs 23,000 per vial. More arrests are likely to follow, cops said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/doc-mbbs-student-arrested-for-black-marketing-remdesivir-vials-in-udaipur/articleshow/82203797.cms||---

According to officials, the state demanded 350 metric tonnes of oxygen up to April 30 and “immediate supply” of 120 metric tonnes. The Centre has assured the state of supplying adequate quantity of oxygen. State chief secretary Niranjan Arya and principal secretary (home) Abhay Kumar also attended the video-conference with the Centre on Thursday. An official said, “The number of Covid cases in the state is rising rapidly. We have a limited production capacity. Considering this, the state government has requested the Centre that the share of the state in terms of oxygen supply should be raised.” “In view of the emergency situation in the state, we would require more than 100 metric tonnes (around 120 metric tonnes) of liquid medical oxygen immediately over and above 205 MTs of oxygen that is available now. Hence, a projection of 350 metric tonnes has been made assuming a certain rate of growth in the number of cases,” he added. In a tweet Gehlot said, “I appeal to all the honorable MPs of the state to please take up Rajasthan’s matter with regard to supply of oxygen and medicines with Delhi. Honorable members of Parliament should also come forward to ensure good coordination between the Centre and the states in terms of medicines, oxygen and vaccine.” “According to experts, the period up to April 30 is very difficult. So, all honorable MPs must pay special attention,” he added. Health minister Raghu Sharma on Wednesday spoke to Union health minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan and demanded a raise in the state’s share in the supply of oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gehlot-asks-centre-for-uninterrupted-supply-of-oxygen-to-raj/articleshow/82203784.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Bank unions want work on rotation to cut Covid risk||PANAJI: Expressing concern over the surge in Covid -19 cases in the state, the Goa Bank Employees’ Association (GBEA) has asked the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC) to take immediate and effective measures to control the spread of the pandemic within banks. Bank branches could become potential hotspots if effective steps are not taken to combat the contagion, Goa Bank Employees’ Association general secretary A M Pereira said. “The speed and spread of the pandemic have increased disturbingly in last three to four weeks and many employees from different banks have been tested positive,” he said. The association has recommended that banks should permit only 50% of the employees to work at branches, while the remaining should be asked to work from home. Female employees who are pregnant, employees with physical disabilities and those suffering from critical illness or comorbidities should be exempted from coming to the branch and should be asked to work from home, it stated. Pereira said that several bank employees who contracted Covid are unable to get proper medical facilities as the hospitals are overloaded. “It is in these distressing, challenging and difficult circumstances, the bank officers and employees are working and the above grim situation has shaken the confidence of the bank staff,” Pereira said. The GBEA has recommended that only essential banking services such as cash deposits and withdrawals, clearing of cheques, remittances and government business may be undertaken till cases reduce. It has also recommended that public banking services should be restricted to 10am to 2pm with banks being closed on all Saturdays to cut the exposure of the bank staff. Pereira has also said that the SLBC should setup a task force on Covid with each bank appointing a nodal officer to provide real time support to the branches and staff. The task force could also explore the possibility of having dedicated tie-ups with hospitals to facilitate provision of emergency medical services to employees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bank-unions-want-work-on-rotation-to-cut-covid-risk/articleshow/82204768.cms||---

Minister to man seeking oxygen for mother||BHOPAL: Union minister for tourism Prahalad Patel was caught on camera threatening to slap a man who was pleading for oxygen for his mother who is admitted to a government hospital in Damoh. Patel, the local MP, was visiting the hospital on Thursday when patients’ relatives surrounded him and complained of shortage of oxygen and injections. In the commotion that followed, one of the men used an expletive while complaining that hospital staff were making them run from pillar to post. In a video that’s going viral, minister Patel then says: “Aisa bolega to do khaega.” In anguish, the man replies, “Haan khaenge, humari mataram to khane ke liye hee padi hain” (Yes, I will. My mother is lying there).” The minister tells him to mind his language and asks, “Is somebody denying you oxygen?” “Yes,” the man says, breaking down, “They gave oxygen only for five minutes, just five minutes.” While the video sparked outrage across the country, the minister’s office denied that he threatened the man.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/do-khaega-minister-to-man-seeking-oxygen-for-mother/articleshow/82206818.cms||---

Suppliers are increasing prices of raw materials almost twice or thrice a month, representatives of foundries said. Prices of raw materials like pig iron, cast iron scrap and copper scrap have increased by almost 50% from November, former IIF chairman Saravanan said. “Price of pig iron has gone up from Rs 37.65/kg in November to Rs 46.63 in April. Price of CI scrap has increased from Rs 32.5/kg to Rs 40/kg. Copper scrap, which used to cost Rs 488/kg, is now available for Rs 680/kg. OEMS take a three-month price average of raw materials, then take another month to calculate and shift to new prices and revise prices in the fifth month,” he said.

The attenders bought necessary items needed by the patients from shops and handed them over to staff nurses. Staff nurses wearing PPE kits would hand over the things to patients. We cannot stop patients from deputing attenders and did not allow any paid attenders inside the corona ward,” he told TOI.“If paid attenders demand money, patients should bring it to the knowledge of hospital authorities,” Raveendran added. According to sources, paid attenders collected Rs 2,500 per day for taking care of Covid-19 patients and Rs 3,000 for taking care of patients in the intensive care unit of the hospital.But hospital authorities said they were not aware about paid attenders.“The hospital management was forced to lodge a complaint with the Singanallur police on Tuesday against paid attender Balaji, who extorted patients. Police arrested Balaji and remanded him in judicial custody,” the source added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/paid-attenders-esi-hospital-dean-defends-authorities/articleshow/82203807.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Hospitals ramp up facilities as situation turns grim in dist||Coimbatore: The district recorded 689 fresh Covid-19 cases on Thursday, taking the total number of cases past the 70,000-mark to 70,262. With 460 people getting discharged, the number of active cases rose to 5,350.One person lost life due to the virus, taking the toll to 710. The victim was a 54-year-old hypertensive woman, who died five days after testing positive due to bronchopneumonia.Though the situation regarding hospital beds and oxygen is not as alarming as north Indian cities like New Delhi, Lucknow and Pune, it is becoming grim. While hardly 600 beds are available in government hospitals, there are around 1,107 beds in private facilities. However, patients say the challenge is in finding a bed with oxygen support or ventilator facilities and in a reputed hospital known for expertise in treating Covid-19. Though the number of active cases in the district crossed the 5,000-mark on Wednesday, the district administration released a list of hospitals along with number of beds available for Covid patients. The list showed 575 beds in government hospitals and 1,107 in private hospitals. While the figures look reassuring, patients and even doctors admit that the situation is growing desperate.“Most of our patients who test positive after admission want to be shifted to well-known private multispecialty hospitals, including PSG Hospitals, Royal Care, KMCH, GKNM or Ramakrishna Hospital, because they believe they have doctors from across specialties who have more experience in handling severe Covid-19 patients,” said a city-based ENT doctor. “However, beds in the five hospitals are full, especially beds with oxygen and ventilator support,” he said.Representatives of six multispecialty hospitals told TOI that their oxygen support and ventilator beds are full. Vacant beds are all general ward beds for mildly symptomatic patients, who can even home quarantine. “We are full and are able to admit only patients against discharge,” said Dr A Murali, Covid-19 nodal officer at PSG Hospitals. “They have been getting full over the last one week. ICU beds got full more than a week ago.”Ramakrishna Hospital which has 252 beds for Covid-19 has only 15 of them for severe patients — five ventilators and 10 oxygen. GKNM has only 15 ICU beds.This has prompted many hospitals to recruit doctors and increase bed-strength rapidly. “We are in the process of recruiting doctors and plan to add 30 beds every week. At least 12 of every 30 new beds will have oxygen facilities,” said Dr Murali.KMCH added 100 new beds, of which 76 can give high flow oxygen. Ramakrishna Hospital has increased bed strength from 80 to 252.In government hospitals, there is a tussle for admission into the ESI Hospital. “Patients want us to arrange admission only in ESI and not any other government hospital. They feel more secure there,” said a hospital’s public relations officer.At ESI Hospital, 605 out of the 680 beds are occupied. Pollachi GH began admitting patients from Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/hospitals-ramp-up-facilities-as-situation-turns-grim-in-dist/articleshow/82203802.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: List of beds vanishes day after upload||DEHRADUN: Information regarding status of bed availability for Covid-19 patients which was put up on the Covid management portal of the health department recently was removed within a day and since then, not been updated. This is despite the Uttarakhand high court (HC) on April 20 asking the state government to upload the status of bed availability for Covid patients on the health department-run website on a daily basis. Incidentally, the list vanished — barely 23 hours after it was uploaded — on a day when the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Rishikesh issued an advisory for patients to come to the hospital only after checking the status of beds on the health department-run portal. According to the orders of the HC, the state was also directed to publicise the names and locations of testing centres and the names and locations of hospitals/ dedicated Covid-19 health care centres in its bulletin on a daily basis. “The media bulletin should clearly indicate the total number of beds available in each hospital/ dedicated Covid-19 health care centres, and the number of vacant beds available in each hospital. It should also indicate the class of the beds, that is the number of beds attached with ventilators, number of beds attached with oxygen tanks, and the number of beds without any oxygen tank,” said the HC order, whose copy is with TOI. However, even 48 hours after the HC order, the crucial information wasn’t included in the daily bulletin. Terming this as a ‘contempt of court’, Anoop Nautiyal from Social Development for Communities Foundation, the Doon-based organisation closely tracking the Covid-19 pandemic in the state, said, “Not only is the information not included in the health bulletin, the crucial information of bed availability has also been removed from the government’s Covid-dedicated website https://covid19.uk.gov.in hours after it was uploaded.” Abhishek Tripathi from the state Covid-19 control room, when queried about the issue, told TOI that the list was removed from the government’s portal “due to some technical reasons.” “We are updating the list which is why it is not visible currently. It will be available soon,” said Tripathi, adding that every hospital in the state has been directed to designate a PRO for disseminating information and all hospitals treating Covid patients must paste the details of available beds outside hospitals on a daily basis. Incidentally, two of the three private labs whose contacts were forwarded by the state government on Wednesday stating that their home sample collection facilities are now available, also said on Thursday that they are still not ready for the task as they are grappling with backlog.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/state-government-shares-hospital-bed-availability-list-on-covid-website-after-hc-order-removes-it-in-just-a-day/articleshow/82202164.cms||Ishita Mishra

Sources from the district health department said a decision was yet to be taken but the plan was under consideration. “The district administration has been asked to take up the issue with the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation authorities to work out on the plan to see if a portion of Salt Lake stadium could be used as a safe house,” said a source from the district health department. The district health department authorities are opening a safe house at the NBCC building in New Town and increasing the number of beds in the existing safe house set up at Haj House. “At present, there are around 150 patients at Haj House that has a setting of about 600 beds. Another 200 beds could be added,” said a health department official. The New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA), on their part, is reintroducing its Covid safe house in New Town in a few days as the banquet hall beside the bus terminus in Action Area I has been temporarily converted as an alternative vaccination centre. “We are also asking the resident welfare associations in New Town to set up isolation rooms with approval of the health department,” said a senior NKDA official. NKDA is also enforcing strict ‘no-mask-no-entry’ rules in Eco Park and monitoring market places. The authorities have also decided to introduce mobile rapid antigen test drives across the township in the morning peak hours, an official said. Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation has plans to come up with safe houses in Salt Lake and Rajarhat with massive spike in Covid cases. About 300 new Covid cases are getting reported daily in Bidhannagar. The number of active cases stand at 2,500 at present. The authorities are running two Covid test centres and 10 vaccination centres. The neighbouring South Dum Dum Municipality also has plans to introduce safe houses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/from-soccer-to-safe-house-new-role-awaits-salt-lake-stadium/articleshow/82202857.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The Central Institute for Subtropical Horticulture (CISH), a Lucknow-based ICAR laboratory, is developing a museum to showcase its huge collection of mango varieties. It will also have international varieties of the fruit on display. The museum will provide information about the history of mango varieties and their usefulness for other purposes, like medicinal value. CISH director Shailendra Rajan said: “CISH is developing a museum dedicated to mangoes so that visitors may be informed about lesser known facts about varieties, medicinal value, products and history.” “India is considered to be the richest in mango varieties and efforts made by farmers, nurserymen and mango lovers have helped in conserving varieties. CISH has the largest live collection of mango varieties and attracts visitors, but after fruiting season one can’t see the fruits. The museum will have over 800 varieties as models or photographs with interesting descriptions so that people can know more about them,” he said. About 80 countries have issued stamps on mangoes. The upcoming museum will also have a corner showcasing stamps for people interested in philately. “Mango is one of the most potential trees providing certain anti-viral, antibacterial, anti-carcinogenic bioactive compounds. A few of them have been reportedly found to be effective as immunity-booster against coronavirus,” the director said. The museum will have a database containing details of medicinal properties of phytochemicals. Mangoes are not only relished as a fresh fruit but have many formulations and value-added products made of mangoes are available throughout the world. The museum will provide information on such products and their nutritive value along with details of recipes made from raw or ripe mangoes. “Mango is the heritage tree of India. It has historical and mythological relevance and enjoys a connect with social, religious and cultural ethos of the country. The museum will also have material on this aspect,” he added. Using audio-visual means, CISH will develop the museum as a storehouse of information on major mango-producing areas of the country and the world.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mango-museum-to-spread-aroma-of-knowledge-for-aam-aadmi/articleshow/82204780.cms||Neha Shukla

Of the 61.85 lakh vaccine doses received by the state till April 20, 49.23 lakh doses have been administered till Wednesday. The state plans to vaccinate at least 10 to 12 lakh people before April 30. Guidelines are being prepared to administer vaccines through camps from May 1. Chief secretary Rajeev Ranjan, who held a marathon meeting with members of coordination committees and district collectors on Thursday, asked the collectors to keep more Covid care centres ready than last year and identify colleges, industrial units, schools and other buildings for the purpose. They were also told to explore the possibility of linking private hospitals with hotels to create private Covid care centres for patients. “The public works department has been asked to ramp up oxygen bed capacity across the state. In Coimbatore, a couple of hospitals have joined hands with hotels to create Covid care centres for non-critical patients, other districts have been advised to follow suit,” a senior official said. People can contact helpline 104 for any doubts. The district collectors have been told to activate screening centres to avoid people not requiring hospitalization using up precious bed capacity. Oxygen bed capacity has been doubled since last year, and 32,942 of the 54,417 beds in Covid facilities are now oxygen beds. The TN medical services corporation has stocked adequate medicines, and life-saving ventilators and high flow nasal canula. Anti-viral drugs like Remdesivir have been adequately procured and distributed to taluk-level hospitals and stock will be available for the next 20 days. Vaccine wastage has been reduced to below 5% since April 1, and the target has been fixed to bring it further down to 3%. Sources said the medical services corporation has promised to ensure adequate supply of Remdesivir drug to private hospitals too. The state’s oxygen storage capacity has been ramped up to 888MT from 395MT last year, and the combined storage capacity of public and private hospitals now stands at 1,167MT. The daily requirement is 240MT. “Considering that the demand may increase in the future, an exclusive control room has been set up,” an official statement said. While the collectors were instructed to increase testing, the Greater Chennai Corporation has been asked to intensify door-to-door visits and vaccination with focus on highly vulnerable areas, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/vaccination-will-be-free-in-tn-even-for-those-in-18-45-group/articleshow/82203835.cms||Julie Mariappan
---||Chandigarh||Labour shortage keeps Punjab wheat lifting below 44%||CHANDIGARH: A sudden arrival of wheat amid labour shortage has piled up stock in the mandis and left Punjab’s lifting crawling at just 43.75%. The arhtiyas (commission agents) claim that the contractors haven’t sent enough workers and vehicles. By Thursday, 70.50 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of wheat had arrived in the state’s mandis, of which progressive procurement was 66.81 LMT but total lifting only 29.23 LMT. Thursday’s arrival was 5.63 LMT and day’s lifting 4.66 LMT. Director food and civil supplies Ravi Bhagat told TOI that both lifting and direct benefit transfer (DBT) payments had picked up over the last few days. He blamed the labour crisis on Covid and claimed that its impact was just initial. On the DBT, he said the farmers had received Rs 4,700 crore, so far, through the new system. The arhtiyas say that the labour and transport contractors at most places want Rs 5 for every bag shipped. Punjab Arhtiyas Association president Ravinder Singh Cheema said: "This is a losing proposition for us, given this glut and lack of space in the markets. We have appealed to the farmers to delay the wheat arrivals." On the effectiveness on the DBT, the arhtiyas claims that the Rajpura farmers whose wheat was auctioned on April 10 still await e-payment. Banur farmer Randhir Singh said: "Inclement weather made us rush. The government has appealled for staggered arrival but the Covid restrictions and farmers’ protest have put us in uncertainty. Seeing the labour shortage, we are wary that our stock might get stuck. The DBT system has also drawn farmers to the mandis." The mandi officials claim that the arhtiyas aren’t cooperating this time, since the DBT system has limited their role. There’s also a shortage of gunny bags and the farmers refuse to follow the token system. By last year’s April 21, Punjab’s wheat procurement was much less at 15.65 LMT. The government officials say that the sudden wheat arrival slowed down lifting, since there’s limited labour and it must follow the Covid protocol. Appeals for staggered procurement ignored, the arrivals peaked within a week at 10 LMT. Wednesday’s arrival was 4.77 LMT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/labour-shortage-keeps-pb-wheat-lifting-below-44/articleshow/82204810.cms||Vibhor Mohan
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra caught napping: Virus spreads faster than medical infra in interiors||MUMBAI: Covid’s second wave has blown the lid off Maharashtra’s grossly underprepared health infrastructure as the occupancy of ventilator, oxygen, ICU and isolation beds touched 190% to 200% in several districts early this week.   According to statistics collated by the public health department, the requirement for ventilators and oxygen beds has surpassed 100% of the availability in six districts, ICU beds in nine districts and isolation beds in 12 districts. The second Covid-19 wave has brought to the surface the pathetic state of Maharashtra’s public health system. Lack of beds of all types is overwhelming hospitals with many districts reporting 190-200% occupancy. Hingoli in Marathwada is one of the grim examples, where 121 patients were vying for 55 ICU beds early this week and 38 patients for 30 ventilators. After Hingoli where the requirement for ventilators touched 126% against availability, it was 102% and 103% for Solapur and Aurangabad respectively. For oxygen beds too, Hingoli’s requirement exceeded 113% this week, while it touched 110% for Bhandara and Nagpur. The demand for ICU beds far outstripped supply in Hingoli, Latur, Yavatmal, Parbhani, Gondia, Nagpur, Akola and Pune districts, where occupancy ranged from 100% to 220%. A doctor in Hingoli said 220% occupancy didn’t mean ventilator beds were shared but indicated there were more critical patients than ICU beds and many were getting ICU treatment in regular wards. In a dozen districts, basic isolation beds are already falling short. In Nanded, there were 8,358 patients accommodated in 4,660 beds early this week. In districts like Chandrapur, Parbhani, Bhandara, Washim, Thane, Gondia, the isolation bed occupancy is in the range of 100% to 180%. Dr Abhijit More of Jan Swasthya Abhiyan said the numbers have exposed the colossal failure on the part of the state to scale up beds, ventilators, oxygen facilities between the first and the second waves. Covid facilities in the state saw a scanty jump from 3,591 in December 2020 to 4,065 in March. Oxygen generation remained almost stagnant between the two waves at 1,250 tonnes. Dr Pradeep Dhele, Solapur’s civil surgeon, said they had exhausted their ventilator beds. “All 243 ventilator beds in the district are full. The spread of the disease is very rapid, and any infrastructure augmentation is getting used up swiftly,” he said. Dr Shekhar Naik, district health officer of Bhandara, said they already have 400 patients in excess of capacity. He didn’t say how they are accommodated except that if room is not created, they have to face the ire of mob and local politicians. In Hingoli, it is not uncommon for relatives to insist they want to share a cot or a room. “Sometimes two to three want to share a room even if we try to resist that,” said Dr Manish Bagdiya, who is on Covid duty in the Civil Hospital. He said the bed and oxygen crisis was acute. Another doctor, though, shared a scarier reality. “Patients are being discharged early, sometimes within 3-5 days, to free up beds, but many are returning with incomplete treatment,” the doctor said, adding many go to private hospitals the second time thinking public centres didn’t treat well. At Chandrapur, the situation si so critical that the district has started setting up Covid Care Centres within villages. “We are equipping them with oxygen support which is usually done in higher centres such as Dedicated Covid Centres,” said Dr Raj Gahlot, adding that they are using auxiliary nursing midwifery and community health officers to man centres as doctors were in short supply. A government official called the trend worrisome as cases in the bigger cities were stabilising, but smaller districts are yet to peak. Dr TP Lahane, head of Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), said that the state has added nearly 3.92 lakh beds, up from 3.50 lakh in the first wave. He said the state’s medical colleges will be adding between 200-300 critical care beds and over 250 ventilators in the next few weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-caught-napping-virus-spreads-faster-than-medical-infra-in-interiors/articleshow/82204950.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Coimbatore||Tirupur MP blames Centre for vaccine, oxygen shortage||Coimbatore: Tirupur MP K Subbarayan has blamed the Union government for shortage of Covid vaccines and oxygen.“On Wednesday, 24 people in Nashik died without oxygen and 2.95 lakh people tested positive in the country,” Subbarayan’s letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi said. “Cases in Tamil Nadu are increasing rapidly and so is the demand for oxygen. At this juncture, the Centre, without the state government’s permission, diverted 45 metric tonnes of oxygen from Tamil Nadu to Andhra Pradesh and Telengana,” he said.Calling out the acute vaccine shortage in districts, the MP said he had gone for his second dose only to be refused and asked to come back the next day. “It is the central and state governments’ responsibility to ensure we have enough stock of medicines, oxygen and vaccines. Instead of encouraging private companies, they should have encouraged the Pasteur Institute of India and King Institute in Chennai to manufacture vaccines.”Tirupur has been facing a major vaccine shortage, especially of Covaxin, leading to other districts like Coimbatore sending doses. The district had been recording 200 to 300 cases a day for the past one week leading to the number of active cases reaching 2,234. It recorded two deaths on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tirupur-mp-blames-centre-for-vaccine-oxygen-shortage/articleshow/82203819.cms||---
---||Lucknow||UP: Doctor’s prescription must for buying, refilling oxygen||LUCKNOW: The state government has now made a doctor’s prescription mandatory for buying oxygen or refilling cylinders. Additional chief secretary (information) Navneet Sehgal said, the decision was taken to curb hoarding of oxygen cylinders in homes. “While we are continuously taking steps to ensure oxygen supply, we will not be possible to meet the rising demand, if people begin hoarding oxygen at home in anticipation of an emergency. Now, oxygen will be sold only if one presents a doctor’s prescription, even if it’s on Whatsapp,” he said. In some cheer amidst the gloom, a train carrying oxygen from Bokaro reached Lucknow on Thursday night. Reliance too is expected to dispatch oxygen from its plant in Gujarat in a few days. The state’s stock is being replenished by oxygen plants in Modinagar, Kashipur, Roorkee and Panipat. Sehgal said, 31 hospitals in the state are also setting up an air separator to manufacture oxygen from the air, thus curbing dependence on liquid oxygen supply. The plant will be operational in two weeks.Also, the Centre has allocated 1,500 oxygen concentrators to Uttar Pradesh for distribution in hospitals. Each concentrator is meant for one patient and will ensure they do not require further intervention.On Thursday, the chief minister gave directions to set up a control room to monitor availability of oxygen in the state. He said, efforts are on to make oxygen available at places for which the Centre has allocated a quota. The food safety and drug administration department and home department have been directed to monitor the control room. Industrial units using oxygen for manufacturing have been given the nod to convert the supply for medicinal purpose. Those factories which manufacture medicinal oxygen and have been lying shut will also be revived, the CM said. Private hospitals are also being encouraged to set up their own oxygen plants. Reviewing the oxygen shortage in some districts, the CM has asked the drug inspector to work as per directions of respective district magistrates. Officials have been deployed to oxygen filling centres to ensure there is no black-marketing. The CM has said that police should also be deputed at filling centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/doctors-prescription-must-for-buying-refilling-oxygen/articleshow/82204842.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Nagpur||Rem, O2 use goes out of control as bed need jumps 90% in 2 weeks||Nagpur: An almost 90% increase in the numbers of beds for Covid patients at hospitals in the district in around 11 days have sent requirement of oxygen and anti-viral Remdesivir drugs skyhigh. On Thursday, district hospitals struggled to supply oxygen to the Covid hospitals with no tankers from outstation sources reaching the city. Only city-based units remained operational. On Friday, a tanker each from Vizag and Bhilai are expected to reach the city. Another from Rourkela is expected on Saturday. District collector Ravindra Thakare said the administration faces an acid test on Friday as the supply chain would fall apart if no tankers reach on time. On Thursday, though around 62% (5,899) of the total bed capacity at the hospitals (9,497) could get Remdesivir, the district administration had to rack their brains to supply oxygen after a tanker broke near Vihirgaon in the early hours. It’s learnt that the tanker was heading to a government hospital. The breakage led to a lot of delay in the oxygen supply at the designated hospital by several hours. To add to the woes of the district administration, an oxygen plant at Wadi developed a technical snag and had to stop operation for the most part of the day. Thakare said the latest break down of the oxygen tanker was the second such unfortunate mishap in the last few days delaying the supply. “Earlier, one had a breakdown near Rajnandgaon. In the latest incident, we had managed to repair the damage but it did lead to delays. The plant at Wadi too was repaired by the evening but it did not give the output we anticipated. Later, we had to focus on another plant at Butibori to make up for the loss and supply those who did not the stock,” said the collector. The skewed ratio of demand and supply of the Remdesivir drug and oxygen, vis-a-vis the rising number of hospitalized patients, too has gone out of control of the district administration to such extent that an attempt to rationalize the distribution and regulate the use has fallen flat now. Since April 11 this month, there is a 17% rise in the number of hospitalized patients — from 13,626 to 16,056 by April 22. A sizeable number of the home isolated patients too are on oxygen. They have been either managing the supply through black market or their connections at the plants, links in the administration or political clout. Dr BK Murli, who owns the Hope Hospital at Kamptee road and also Ayushman hospital at Ramdaspeth hospital, said he has started avoiding admitting patients for want of oxygen especially those requiring ventilator. “We are facing shortage of oxygen in both our hospitals. The supply agents whom the government has assigned to us are also not delivering the assured quota,” said Murli. He added that a patient can survive without Remdesivir but oxygen is crucial for survival in Covid. Dr Anup Marar, convenor of the Vidarbha Hospitals’ Association, said the district administration must try to stick to the promise of the assured quantity of oxygen within the stipulated time. “Since the day the system of rationing of oxygen was put in place, we have got the supply neither on time nor the quantity assured,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rem-o2-use-goes-out-of-control-as-bed-need-jumps-90-in-2-weeks/articleshow/82203830.cms||Soumitra Bose

Police officials, including senior cops and the district officials reached the spot but farmers did not allow the car of CM’s advisor, Bharat Inder Singh Chahal to pass. They demanded provision of gunny bags in the grain market for smooth procurement and lifting of wheat. Farmers criticised the state government and Punjab chief minister for failing to provide gunny bags in grain markets. For the past few days, farmers in several grain markets across the state have been protesting against the shortage of gunny bags. Farmers claimed that on Thursday, they were already protesting at Rurki grain market against shortage of gunny bags when they learnt about the CM’s advisor crossing the area near the grain market on his way to Chandigarh. On getting to know about this, they gheraoed him, they said. Farmers claimed to have gheraoed the CM’s advisor from around 12.30pm to 4pm, till officials provided gunny bags at the grain market and said that every day, their requirement of gunny bags is met only after protest. Fatehgarh Sahib SSP Amneet Kondal said, “Farmers gheraoed B I S Chahal’s vehicle for three to four hours till the matter was sorted out by DFSC, who had to meet their gunny bag requirements.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-gherao-cms-adviser-over-shortage-of-gunny-bags/articleshow/82204844.cms||---

After maintaining silence for weeks, the state government came out with some restrictions on Wednesday enforcing Section 144 of the CrPC and a night curfew from 10pm to 6am. Those caught without face masks and not maintaining social distance are being penalised, the officer said. This month, till date, around 30,000 people have been fined for not wearing masks, including 13,620 in North Goa, 12,392 in South Goa and 4,352 by the traffic cell. “We are focusing on mask distribution and prosecution, creating awareness about the vaccination drive through announcements from PCR vehicles and placing pickets to crack down on those violating Covid norms,” South Goa SP Pankaj Kumar Singh said. Around 26 night pickets have been placed in South Goa to check for unnecessary movement of vehicles. In addition, police personnel are also counselling the public to use masks and maintain social distance. “We are spreading awareness especially in market areas, bus stands, outside railway stations, airport, and tourist and residential areas,” Singh said. Besides the police station staff, a platoon has been deployed at each police station to ramp up personnel strength. Special teams have also been deployed to check for violations of Covid norms at all hotels, restaurants and clubs. All police inspectors (PIs), deputy superintendents of police (DySPs), superintendents of police (SPs) and PCR vans are patrolling areas to enforce the night curfew. The police officer said they have briefed police personnel about what should be closed and what has been exempted during the night curfew.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/over-1500-police-personnel-to-enforce-night-curfew-covid-norms/articleshow/82204920.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Muslim pandit and Sanskrit scholar Birajdar passes away in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Pandit Ghulam Dastagir Birajdar, a noted Muslim pandit, a Sanskrit scholar and chairman of the committee to prepare school textbooks for Sanskrit in Maharashtra, died of brain hemorrhage on Thursday. He was 87. He was laid to rest at his hometown Solapur, said his grandson Danish Shaikh. Known for his crusade against communalism and promotion of communal harmony, Pandit Birajdar was among half a dozen Muslim pandits in the country whose knowledge of Sanskrit earned them accolades. As former general secretary of the Vishwa Sanskrit Pratishthan in Varanasi and a certified pandit who also received a citation from former President Dr K R Narayanan, he was invited to give lectures to Sanskrit scholars and students at Benares Hindu University and other institutions. He retired as a Sanskrit teacher from a school in Mumbai and lived in Worli. “Language has no religion and no community has a divine right to learn any language. It is a wrong notion that only Brahmins should learn Sanskrit just as it is equally wrong to believe only Muslims should learn Arabic,” Pandit Birajdar had told TOI in an interview earlier. “He was among the pioneers in Sanskrit teaching in the country and was a gentle soul,” said Dr Meraj Ahmed Khan, who teaches Sanskrit at Kashmir University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/muslim-pandit-and-sanskrit-scholar-birajdar-passes-away-in-mumbai/articleshow/82204917.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin
---||Chandigarh||Barricades on one side of highway at Singhu border to go||Bathinda: The Haryana government officials in a meeting with leaders of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Thursday evening decided to remove barricades from one side of the highway at Singhu border to give free passage to oxygen, ambulance and other such emergency services. The morcha leaders assured them of support in every possible way the fight against the pandemic. The meeting was attended by Sonipat superintendent of police, chief medical officer and SKM leaders. The morcha leaders stated that while the government has baselessly accused the protesting farmers of obstructing oxygen supply to Delhi, they have seen cops sending oxygen supply trucks towards protest sites, instead of directing them to the right and shortest route. It is the government which is to be blamed for barricading roads and obstructing free passage, whereas farmers have allowed vehicular movement at all protest sites, they said. Regarding luring migrant workers to protest sites, the SKM leaders claimed that farmers who left for wheat harvesting operations have started returning to protest sites and the farm movement does not need migrant workers for that reason. The invitation was extended because farmers understand the distress of these migrant workers and wanted them to realise that it was futile to depend on the government to find them jobs in their native villages. Once a semblance of normalcy is restored, migrant workers can return to their jobs and also save on unnecessary travel costs, they said. At an interaction organised through the Geneva Press Club on Wednesday evening, SKM leaders pointed out that the only solution to the current deadlock was for the government to re-initiate a formal dialogue and repeal the three central farm laws besides bringing in a law guaranteeing MSP immediately. At the interaction, Swiss parliamentarian, Nicolas Walder expressed his admiration for the ongoing peaceful struggle and pointed out that there can never be a solution for farmers if such a solution is led by agri-business corporations. He said that the Indian protests are not just about farmers in India but about the future of farmers all over the world.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/barricades-on-one-side-of-highway-at-singhu-border-to-go/articleshow/82204876.cms||---

Addressing a roundtable on Thursday, jointly organised by the UP government and UK India Business Council (UKIBC), which was attended by over 120 defence, aerospace and security companies, Singh spoke about UP’s emergence as India’s second highest GDP ranking state and said that its per capita income had doubled in the last few years. “There has been a marked improvement in UP’s Ease of Doing Business rankings as it is now ranked as the second best state in India. The state has an aggressive policy on defence and aerospace with a strong network of banking and financial services. There are 90 million MSMEs functional here, many of which are already serving the defence sector,” the minister said. Awanish Awasthi, CEO of UPEIDA, said that UP had the advantage of land availability, labour, electricity, infrastructure, skilled manpower and, above all, a supportive government. UKIBC’s Group CEO Jayant Krishna said that UK defence and security firms could leverage British technology, and even co-create products through a joint UK-India development team for manufacturing in UP’s defence corridor. Graham Stuart spoke about the how UK, with its huge technology advantage, is the world’s second largest defence exporter as well as the third largest security equipment exporter in the world.

---||Surat||Gujarat: Man sells duplicate remdesivir vials containing water!||SURAT: In what can be attributed as adding salt to injury, an unscrupulous person was nabbed by Sarthana police on Thursday after locals caught him in Yogi Chowk for selling duplicate remdesivir injections. The accused who identified himself as Divyesh had allegedly sold six duplicate vials for Rs 7,000 each on Wednesday. The victim’s family caught the accused when he came to accept the vials back on Thursday. He was handed over to Sarthana police along with the injection vials. However, police told the victim’s family that the delivery of the vials was done under Umra police station jurisdiction and hence, the complaint should be registered there. After Jignesh Malani and his family reached Umra police station to lodge a complaint, Umra police refused to register the complaint and sent them back to Sarthana. Only in the evening did Sarthana police start the process to register their complaint. “The victim family was sold remdesivir vials. We are verifying if the vials contain duplicate or expired material. Prima facie, it is a case of unauthorised sale of a highly scarce product at a higher price,” said C K Patel, assistant commissioner of police. “It will be verified what material the vials contain. The complainants are claiming that it contains water,” said the police. Manish Hirpara, a friend of Malani, said, “A family member of Malani is admitted in a hospital at Yogi Chowk. The doctor asked us to get the injection and we could not arrange it through government supply. Hence we tried searching outside and found the contact number of this person.” He further said that the accused offered to give one injection for Rs 7,000. “We agreed and accepted the injection near Vanita Vishram Ground near Athwa Gate. Later, when we reached the hospital, we realised that the injections are fake and the vials also had an expiry date of 2020,” said Hirpara. The family was also told that remdesivir injection comes in powder form and not liquid, whereas the vials supplied to them were in liquid form. They then called the accused over the phone who confessed that he supplied duplicate material and agreed to return the money. “The accused returned the money through Google Pay on Thursday morning and came to take back the vials when we caught him and handed him over to the police,” said Hirpara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/man-sells-duplicate-remdesivir-vials-containing-water/articleshow/82202909.cms||---

According to police, P Anbarasan, 28, of Railway Colony in Krishnagiri, has left a suicide note. As per preliminary probe, the cop was under severe depression as his wife had fought with him and went to her parent’s house on ‘Ugadi’ day. Anbarasan had joined the police department in 2013 and was working as the constable attached to the Krishnagiri armed reserve police. He got married to S Aruna of Rayakottai recently and his wife is three months pregnant now. Preliminary inquiry revealed that Anbarasan had been working as the personal security officer of the principal district and sessions judge R Kalaimathi for the last eight months. He went to work on Wednesday morning and did not return home at night. His family members and relatives launched a search for him but in vain. On Thursday, a sanitary worker had gone to the first floor of the Krishnagiri court complex and found the body of Anbarasan. He alerted judicial officers and Krishnagiri taluk police who rushed to the spot. Krishnagiri district superintendent of police Bandi Gangadhar and police officials also reached the spot immediately. Fingerprint bureau sub-inspectors and a scientific officer also visited the spot. “Anbarasan used his 9mm pistol to commit suicide. The bullet pierced his head and the shell came out of the head. He also left a suicide note and claimed that his family members should not feel for his decision. Our police teams have been working on various angles to know the cause of the suicide,” said SP Bandi Gangadhar. Preliminary inquiry revealed that Anbarasan was under severe depression due to family problems. His wife fought with him and went to her parent’s house on the auspicious day ‘Ugadi’. He was in depression and took the extreme step. The Krishnagiri taluk police registered a case under section 174 CrPC and sent the body to the Krishnagiri government hospital for postmortem. Further investigation is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cop-shoots-self-on-tn-court-premises/articleshow/82203926.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Hospitals, homes buy O2 concentrators to beat crunch||MUMBAI: On the list of essentials to fight Covid, oxygen concentrators figure high these days. A concentrator filters oxygen from the atmosphere, passes it through a humidifier and is inhaled by a patient. Oxygen shortage across states has seen a spurt in demand for concentrators not only from critical patients who need it after being discharged from hospitals, but also from smaller nursing homes and NGOs that rent out medical equipment. Then there are those with senior citizens at home who are buying these machines as an insurance inventory. Most companies that manufacture and import oxygen concentrators concurred that demand had surged in the past few weeks, forcing them to ramp up production and increase orders to meet local needs. That has even seen rates hiked in some cases. “In what suddenly seems to be a busy time for us, we have placed additional orders to import oxygen concentrators. We have run out of the entire stock,” said Vinod Gothwaria, regional manager at Accusure. Selling about a piece or two a month, the past two weeks have seen sale of over 125 pieces only in Mumbai and Thane. Daniel Mazon, managing director, Philips Indian Subcontinent, told TOI: “For the current demand, we have significantly increased our global production of oxygen concentrators and are making it available to India to help save more lives.” Another manufacturer, Eloxy, based out of Dahisar, said there is a demand for 100 units a day. But as the company cannot meet the demand, said Akshay, a representative, it has started importing concentrators from China, US, Korea and France. Rotary Club of Borivli, under its “need of the hour” project, saw requests from hospitals, youth organisations and other associations and NGOs, said medical director Dharmaji Shinde. Dentist Priyanka Deshpande said, “I bought one as it would be life-saving. It is like a medical policy and I hope I never have to use it.” Some hospitals too are encouraging patients to use their own O2 concentrators so they don’t deplete their own reserves. “After two days of searching for an OC, I ended up buying six pieces of mini oxygen cylinders. I am still looking for an OC machine. I don’t mind keeping it at home as it is a life-saving machine,” said Daljit Singh, an automobile car dealer. Dr Shahid Barmare from Kohinoor Hospital, Kurla, said, “These machines are a boon for those infected with Covid and have comorbidities and acute shortage of oxygen. However, these machines have limited oxygen capacity.” Kalina’s Dr Shakeel Khan, a general physician, said, “More and more people are looking for options to buy OC units. These machines can only produce 4 to 5 litre when there could be a requirement of over 50 to 60 litre.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hosps-homes-buy-o2-concentrators-to-beat-crunch/articleshow/82202920.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Dehradun||'Enforce total lockdown or let us open shops till 6pm': Traders||DEHRADUN: The morning rush at markets in Doon, prompted by the state’s new guidelines that require shops (except those selling essentials) to be closed at 2 pm, continued on Thursday. Places like Hanuman Chowk market, Moti Bazaar and Paltan Bazaar were choc-a-bloc with people rushing to complete their purchases, many ignoring Covid norms. However, between 7 pm and 5 am, the night curfew timings, and post 2 pm, the streets remained relatively empty, in a scenario that was reminiscent of last year’s nationwide lockdown. Meanwhile, Pankaj Masson, president of traders’ body Doon Valley Mahanagar Vyapar Mandal, has written to the district magistrate to either impose a complete lockdown for 10 days or allow the shop owners to remain open till 6 pm. The traders said that opening shops for such a short time in the morning leads to “surging crowds throughout morning hours, which increases chances of the virus spreading, puts shopkeepers at risk and ultimately defeats the very purpose of the curbs.” With cases of coronavirus continuing to rise in the state capital, officials of Niranjanpur Mandi, the district’s main wholesale vegetable market, have also decided to resume the system of altering between vehicles of odd and even registration numbers in order to allow only a limited number of vehicles inside the mandi premises. Residents meanwhile welcomed the partial lockdown saying that it was necessary to break the chain. Rani Sodhi, a retired teacher, said, “The fear among residents is palpable but the restrictions are needed. It reminds us of the urgency of the situation and the fact that we still need to stay cautious till this phase of the pandemic gets over.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/morning-rush-continues-traders-say-opening-shops-for-limited-time-increases-chances-of-virus-spreading/articleshow/82202207.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Timely medication & steroids and not Remdesivir key to Covid cure: Expert||Lucknow: Even as reports of people running from pillar to post to get Remdesivir and Fabiflu medicine for corona patients has been on the rise, scientists, citing several researches and studies, are of the opinion that clinical outcome may not change by using the fabiflu or remdesivir. In the case of Remdesivir, in certain reports it has been though indicated that it can at best reduce hospital time as these medicines are anti-viral. People rather should go for steroids along with other prescribed combinations to save the vital organs like lungs, heart, brain and kidney. Citing reports, Prof Ramji Upadhyaya, an expert on infectious disease, said that during the first wave, symptoms were different than in this wave. Then symptoms were showing only after fourth or fifth day and disease progress worsened after fifth to sixth day onwards, however, now if you don’t pay attention on the day one itself, it could affect the patient severely. Timing is very important, he said. Rather than waiting for the RT-PCR report, which is taking three to four days, one should go for CBP, CRP, LDH and D-dimer blood tests, if one is showing even minor symptoms or is surrounded by positive family members at home, Prof Ram, who is a native of Agra in Uttar Pradesh, said and added, reports of these tests would come in a matter of few hours. Medications like steroids and colchicine should be taken immediately in calibrated dose if the reports show hiked protein and inflammation. He said that it has been seen that steroids have shown great impact in saving the vital organs, if the same had been taken in time. Further elaborating on the reason for hurry, Prof Ram said that suppose one’s house has caught fire, instead of going into the cause of fire, one will first try to extinguish the fire. Similarly, CBP and CRP will show the level of inflammation and if it is high, the first thing to be done is to reduce the same and it can be done by administering steroids in calibrated dose, the findings have shown, Prof Ram, who is the chief scientist at Ohm Oncology, USA, said. Earlier, the level of inflammation rose after the fifth or sixth day, but now it is being seen that the level has seen big jump even on the first day and hence the protocol of the treatment should be changed, he said. Hence steroid from the first day is a better way to save the lives of corona patients, Prof Ram said and added that among steroids Dexamethasone and Prednisolone can be given. He further said that High resolution CT alone would not help in identifying the infection as some shadow or patches in lungs could be because of environmental concern and the same could be misunderstood as Corona effect. Citing a study at King’s College London, Prof Ram, who is also the professor at Plasma Bioscience Research Centre (PBRC)/ Applied Medicine Research Centre, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea, further said they conducted a biopsy of Corona infected body and found that the lungs have got solidified due to blood clotting. If the Corona infection reaches lungs, blood thinner should be given along with steroids to save the solidification of the lungs due to Coronavirus. However, the blood thinner should not be low molecular weight Heparin, which can induce thrombocytopenia, which is more common in females especially in those which are on any kind of hormonal replacement therapy or during pre-menopause stage. Chances of clotting are more in high-risk patients those who are above 45 years of age, Prof Ram further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/timely-medication-steroids-and-not-remdesivir-key-to-covid-cure-expert/articleshow/82204953.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Punjab farmers happy with DBT, but want arhtiyas in system||BATHINDA: Farmers in Punjab have since long demanded direct payment, bypassing arhtiyas, after the sale of their produce. The demand stemmed from apprehensions of arhtiyas deducting the loan amount advanced to farmers or at least the interest instalments after getting money from the government on behalf of the farmers. However, when the central government, conceding to their long pending demand, went in for the direct benefit transfer (DBT), farmers were not much enthused and even expressed solidarity with the arhtiyas to reciprocate for the support provided to them in the protest against the central government while demanding repeal of contentious agriculture marketing laws. Though keen on direct payment, farmers don’t want to spoil their relations with arhityas and have termed the much sought after DBT as ill-timed. Farmers and arhtiyas are considered two major players in the farm sector in India, especially in Punjab and Haryana. Farmers produce the crop in fields and arhtiyas play a major role in marketing the crops. For decades, their relations have been through various phases, including the times when farmers called arhtiyas bloodsuckers and accused them of charging exorbitant intertest rates on loans advanced to them. Yet, the two have remained an integral part of the farming sector. Arhtiyas get 2.5% commission for providing various services in APMC and mediating between buyer-seller of grains. Role of arhtiyas in lives of farmersA study by Sukhpal Singh and Tejinder K Dhaliwal from PAU’s department of economics and sociology in 2011 — The Status of Commission Agent System in Punjab Agriculture —reveals that the capital intensive nature of green revolution technology increased the financial needs of farmers and procurement needs of the state due to substantial increase in farm production. As a result, two inter-linked markets — credit market and product market — emerged, wherein arhtiyas played a dominant role. As institutional sources alone could not meet the credit requirements of farmers, they had to go for non-institutional credit, especially arhtiyas. Arhtiyas were earlier accused of charging up to 36% annual interest, sometimes even more, and were called bloodsuckers as small farmers were unable in pay back loans. However, with time, even the interest rate came down to 15-16% per annum. But many a times, farmers need money to purchase grocery, clothes, pesticides and so on from designated shops, where arhtiyas have some interest. So the love-hate relationship between the two has continued. Arhtiyas turn farmers’ ATMsThe farmer-arhtiya ties are not limited only to lending money for farm-related needs. As farmers did not find institutional lending an easy avenue, they started leaning more towards arhityas for their needs like money for medical treatment, solemnising marriages, fulfilling various other social obligations and, recently, to get son/daughter ace the IELTS exam and subsequently settle abroad. Farmers are not averse to selling a piece of land to meet their financial needs but they need to get money till the sale happens. In such circumstances, farmers turn to arhtiyas for availing small or bigger amounts of money. The institutional lending was mostly not easy to avail for farmers as they faced a lot of hardship. According to a 2009 study ‘Inadequacies of institutional agricultural credit system in Punjab’ by PAU’s Sukhpal Singh, Manjit Kaur and H S Kingra, 59% farmers found the procedure to avail loans from institutional agencies too complicated and time consuming. Some turnaround in relationshipWhen the central government took the ordinance route to push in certain amendments in farm sector, then brought in bills and Acts in quick succession, farmers opposed them vehemently. They got big support from arhtiyas, who stood by them and sent their representatives to Delhi borders to stand by them. It is due to this support that when the central government targeted arhityas by bringing DBT, farmers opposed it and called it ill-timed move, to strains the farmer-arhtiya ties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-farmers-happy-with-dbt-but-want-arhtiyas-in-system/articleshow/82204959.cms||Neel Kamal

The move to observe a three-day self-lockdown has resonated among various traders’ associations and markets across Ahmedabad, amid a steep rise in cases of Covid-19 every single day.  After Jewellers’ Association of Ahmedabad (JAA) announced a three-day shutdown from Friday to Sunday, six more trade associations have joined the move. Electric Merchants and Contractors’ Association, Gandhi Road Vepari Mandal, Dariyapur Hardware Merchants Association, Gujarat Garments Manufacturers’ Association (GGMA) and Maskati Cloth Merchants’ Association on Thursday made an appeal to their members to keep the markets shut for three days and resume only on Monday. Traders are as such struggling to do business amid a slump in demand and gradually weakening consumer sentiment, and most feel that it would do no harm in keeping businesses shut for three days. Earlier this week, Jewellers’ Association of Ahmedabad (JAA) and Two-Wheeler Dealers’ Association (TDA) too announced similar measure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/6-more-trade-bodies-join-3-day-shutdown/articleshow/82204053.cms||---

The railway minister Piyush Goyal also informed in his tweet that the Oxygen Express, which started its journey from Lucknow on Thursday, crossed Varanasi on the same day after a few hours. He said that a Green Corridor was created from Lucknow to Varanasi to allow fast movement of the train. According to the Ministry of Railways, the Indian Railway is running Oxygen Express in response to its fight against Covid-19. The first Oxygen Express with Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) tankers is going to start its journey for Mumbai from Visakhapatnam on Thursday night. Tankers filled with LMO at Visakhapatnam are being transported through Ro-Ro service of Indian Railways. Another Oxygen Express started its journey from Lucknow to Bokaro via Varanasi to fulfil the requirements of Medical Oxygen in Uttar Pradesh. For the movement of the train, a green corridor was created between Lucknow to Varanasi. The distance of 270 km was covered by the train in 4 hours 20 minutes with an average speed of 62.35 kmph. The transportation of Oxygen through trains is faster over long distances than road transport as trains can run 24 hours in a day but the truck drivers need to take halts. To facilitate loading/unloading of tankers in/from flat wagons, a ramp is required. Also, due to restrictions of height of Road Over Bridges (ROBs) and Over Head Equipment (OHE) at certain locations, out of the various specifications of road tankers, the model of road tanker T 1618 with height of 3320 mm was found feasible to be placed on flat wagons (DBKM) with height of 1290 mm. Railways transported essential commodities and kept the supply chain intact even during the lockdown in 2020 and continues to serve the nation in times of emergencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/oxygen-exp-covers-lucknow-varanasi-distance-in-4hrs-20min-on-way-to-bokaro-steel-plant/articleshow/82204997.cms||---

Apart from arresting the three accused, the police have also recovered two motorcycles used in the crime. “We have arrested Mahesh Shardiya (26), a resident of Tarnetar village, Sagram Makwana (27) and Jaga Makwana (24), both residents of Thangadh town. Last week, the three persons had come on bike, with their faces covered in masks, and looted Angadia firm owner Viral Gandhi of Rs 76.50 lakh. We analysed the CCTV camera footage around the crime spot and identified the bike’s number,” said police. “The bike was registered in the name of Mahesh Shardiya. In order to cover his tracks, he gave his bike to his friends in Morbi town after the loot. We called him for questioning and grilled him. He later confessed of committing the crime and also spilled the beans on his accomplices. We later arrested other accused involved in this crime. Mahesh’s cousin brother Shiva had tipped him about the movement of the cash of that particular Angadia firm. Based on the information, the trio executed their plan,” police added. Police have seized Rs 76.45 lakh cash from the accused. “All the three accused are casual labourers. In order to earn quick money they decided to commit the crime,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/three-held-for-looting-angadia-rs-77-lakh-recovered/articleshow/82202929.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Forest dept trying to recover Rs1.46 cr excess commission paid to service provider||Nagpur: The state forest department is in the eye of a storm for paying Rs1.46 crore excess commission to an authorized service provider (ASP) facilitating e-auction of timber, firewood, and bamboo.A note (copy with TOI) signed by state PCCF (head of forest force) G Saiprakash on April 7, 2021, says Rs1.46 crore excess commission was paid to Sparsh Technology over 2017-18 and 2018-19, as identified by a forest department internal audit. “The complaints were during the tenure of my predecessor. As per the audit, prima facie excess payment is apparent, but we are still examining the issue. It will not be proper to comment now,” Saiprakash told TOI.The state government had on November 7, 2015, approved appointment of Sparsh for three years for sale of timber, firewood, and bamboo through e-auction on build, own, operate, transfer (BOOT) model.The government had capped commission of Sparsh at 0.399% on Rs120 crore. Sparsh was not to get any more commission if revenue in a year went beyond Rs120 crore. Sparsh was appointed for 3 years, to be extended maximum to 5 years. The 5-year period ended on November 30, 2020, but the government granted further extension till November 30, 2021.From December 1, 2017, to November 30, 2018, the revenue from sale of timber, firewood, and bamboo was Rs176 crore, and Sparsh was Rs69.71 lakh commission, which had excess payment of Rs21.88 lakh.Similarly, Sparsh was paid excess Rs64.88 lakh from December 1, 2018, to November 30, 2019, and Rs59.30 lakh excess from December 1, 2019, to November 30, 2020. Thus Sparsh was paid Rs1.46 crore in excess over last three years, says the department audit.There is a proposal to pay Sparsh commission for revenue over Rs120 crore also, but it is yet to be approved by the government. For now, the service provider has been directed to refund the excess amount to the forest department.PCCF (P&M) Praveen Srivastava has been directed by G Saiprakash to communicate the decision of recovery of Rs1.46 crore. However, Srivastava denies there is any irregularity. He said, “In 2015, only Ballarshah, Jodmoha, and Paratwada depots were in the e-auction, for which 0.399% commission was fixed.”“Later, 52-53 depots in the state were added with government approval to e-auction. Hence, commission to service provider should increase. Some misinformation is creating confusion. There is government approval and same parameters applicable to three depots are also valid for other newly added depots,” he said.However, sources said there is no approval as yet.Srivastava said, “If the state wishes, it can take over the project from the service provider by paying his expenses as five-year term has already ended. There is zero loss to the government. Today, e-auction fetched revenue of Rs296 crore, which never went beyond Rs260 crore in last 20 years.”Before his retirement, ex-HoFF UK Agrawal gave extension to Sparsh from December 1, 2019, to November 30, 2020, for all depots without government approval. Those who opposed this were warned of action by senior officials. In February 2021, a report against this irregularity was sent by then PCCF (HoFF) N Rambabu to the government. There has been no action.COMMISSION AND OMISSIONSparsh appointed to manage e-auction for forest department in 2015Commission to Sparsh was capped at 0.399% for revenue up to Rs120 cr onlyFirst approval was for 3-5 years, and 3 depotsSparsh handled 52-53 depots in e-auctionNo govt approval for addition of depots or payment of excess commission to SparshSparsh paid Rs1.46 crore excess commission over last three yearsForest dept has notified Sparsh to refund excess commission||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/forest-dept-trying-to-recover-rs1-46-cr-excess-commission-paid-to-service-provider/articleshow/82203937.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Ludhiana||BJP leaders try to hold meeting, face protesting farmers||PATIALA: Tension mounted in Patiala on Thursday after farmers protested against BJP leaders holding a meeting in an inn near a temple in the city. Police intervened and averted a clash between farmers and BJP workers. Police managed to help BJP leader Gurtej Singh and party workers escape safely through another gate of the inn. However, farmers staged a protest near the bus stand traffic lights around noon on Thursday. Farmers sought an apology from the police for allegedly misbehaving and cane-charging them. They also demanded an assurance from BJP leaders to not come for any political meetings till the Centre resolved the issue of the three agricultural laws. Jang Singh Bhateri, Patiala president of Krantikari Kisan Union said, “Our union, along with farmers of BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) protested against BJP leaders and workers for holding a meeting in the city. BJP leaders are making provocative statements against farmers in Punjab and holding meetings despite facing farmers’ protest.” BJP state executive member Gurtej Singh Dhillon said he, along with newly-appointed BJP leader from Ludhiana, on Thursday, was holding a meeting with party workers at the dharamshala (inn) of a local temple near the bus stand when farmers began to protest. “A clash did not take place but the way farmers are behaving and trying to indulge in violence cannot be justified. Farmers are our brothers and the issue of the agricultural laws can only be resolved with talks,” he said. He also urged chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh to give state police a free hand to maintain law and order. “On Wednesday, a few SAD (B) workers under the shadow of protesting farmers planned to set my vehicle on fire but a senior cop on duty saved my vehicle by deploying heavy police force. In both cases, I haven’t filed any legal complaint to the police against the farmers,” he alleged. Police denied lathicharge or use of force against the farmers. SSP Vikram Jeet Duggal said, “We haven’t resorted to lathicharge on farmers. No case has been registered against any farmer or BJP worker.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/bjp-leaders-try-to-hold-meeting-face-protesting-farmers/articleshow/82204999.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Turnaround time for an ICU bed high, sometimes wait lasts 8 hours’||MUMBAI: Covid-19 patients and their kin desperately looking for an ICU or ventilator bed has become a common sight in the city these days. The wait can stretch into hours. “Even for patients with respiratory failure, it takes at least six to eight hours, or even more, to get an ICU bed,” a doctor from a private hospital said. In BMC-run Sion hospital, at any given time there are 10 to 15 patients in the emergency department on oxygen support, waiting for an ICU bed. A BMC official said that the turnaround time for an ICU bed is always high. “Patients on ICU beds cannot be discharged,” the official said. AAP said its team had also found a lag in the BMC dashboard meant to display live updates of available beds. “The dashboard does not show a bed is available but, on calling war rooms, officials say a bed that was recently available was just allocated by them. Basically, the information was not synchronised with the dashboard,” an AAP member said. Congress corporator Ravi Raja said that in the BMC standing committee meeting held earlier in the day, he raised the issue of the dashboard providing no clarity on where the vacant oxygen and ICU beds it displayed were available in the city. “After raising the issue, the administration says they are preparing for the third wave. But when you can’t handle the situation now, what will happen during the third wave?” Raja said. He said the administration should be more proactive in providing information to corporators, who are in direct touch with citizens. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said augmentation of ICU beds should have been accomplished after the first wave. “The case numbers have more than doubled now and the ICU bed numbers have not been accordingly increased,” he said. “I call the dashboard a ‘deadboard’ as the BMC shows some figures for oxygen, ventilator and ICU beds and the ground reality is different. I know of three patients who are waiting in queue to get an ICU bed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-turnaround-time-for-an-icu-bed-high-sometimes-wait-lasts-8-hrs/articleshow/82205008.cms||Richa Pinto

Kumbhakoni informed the court that a preliminary report on the incident at Zakir Hussain Hospital was sent by the Nashik Municipal Corporation to the chief secretary. Kumbhakoni explained that the report stated that the liquid oxygen tank was installed on a contract with a private company that was tasked with maintenance and refill. Upon noticing pressure of oxygen to patients was less, an inspection found a leakage in the tank’s valve connecting the hospital supply. Incidentally the same day the tank was to be refilled. “The report does not make clear what went wrong or whether it happened during refilling,” Kumbhakoni said. He said oxygen pressure dropped and disrupted the supply for “one hour and twenty minutes”. “In that situation these deaths were caused,” he said, adding that after repair, supply was restored to the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-expresses-grief-seeks-nashik-hosp-tragedy-report/articleshow/82205052.cms||Rosy Sequeira

The incident happened near Maharana Pratap Society at around 10pm on Wednesday. While the victim, Sangita Ahire, has been hospitalized, police booked history-sheeter Ramu Goswami on charges of attempt to murder and under sections of the Arms Act. Ahire suffered serious injury near the nose as the bullet pierced through her face and came out from near the ear. The woman is conscious and police recorded her statement as well. Complainant Sushila Ahire, sister-in-law of the victim, lodged a complaint and told Godadara police that she and Sangita were sitting on a bench near a temple when Goswami came there with his friend and struck a conversation. “It’s my birthday. Won’t you bless me?” Goswami asked Ahire, said Sushila. Ahire tried to ignore him first as she did not know him. But when he showed the gun, she casually inquired if it was working. At this, Goswami suddenly fired one round from the weapon, said police. “Ahire and her sister-in-law shared some details about the conversation with Goswami but we are investigating the case from multiple angles. It is yet not clear exactly why he fired at her,” said a police officer at Godadara police station. “We have launched a manhunt for Goswami. Ahire will undergo a surgery for the injuries,” said A M Parmar, assistant commissioner of police, B-division, adding that the bullet has been seized.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/man-fires-bullet-pierces-womans-face/articleshow/82202942.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Sukhbir asks CM to step out of farmhouse to end chaos in mandis||Bathinda: Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal has held chief minister Amarinder Singh directly responsible for the total chaos in ‘mandis’ in the state, saying farmers were forced to camp in miserable conditions at procurement centres due to the state’s inability to arrange gunny bags. Sukhbir on Thursday visited various grain markets in Bathinda and Moga and asked the SAD members to assist farmers in procurement centres in getting their crop procured. He announced that the party would hold symbolic district-level ‘dharnas’ across the state on April 24 in front of the offices of the deputy commissioners to submit memorandums demanding the problems being faced by farmers in ‘mandis’ be resolved immediately. Asking the chief minister to step out of his farmhouse and address the problems being faced by farmers, Sukhbir Badal said the chief minister should also direct senior officers to visit all ‘mandis’ and remove shortcomings, which were resulting in extremely slow procurement of wheat. “Farmers have told me that they are camping in mandis for more than one week to await procurement of their produce. A large part of procured wheat is lying in the open in mandis and not being lifted due to lack of gunny bags,” he added. Badal said farmers and arhtiyas had conveyed to him that they were now being asked to arrange for gunny bags on their own. He said the government was claiming it had made a payment of Rs 6,000 crore to farmers when the actual payment was only Rs 3,400 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sukhbir-asks-cm-to-step-out-of-farmhouse-to-end-chaos-in-mandis/articleshow/82205043.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Hosps Seek Seamless Supply Of O2, Meds, Docs||Ranchi: Struggling to cope with the number of Covid patients seeking treatment, hospitals in Jharkhand on Thursday asked the state to ensure unhindered supply of oxygen, Remdesivir and human resources. Doctors put forth their suggestions at a hastily summoned virtual meeting with chief minister Hemant Soren and senior bureaucrats involved in managing the pandemic. The meeting was held a day after the number of active cases in the state crossed 35,000-mark for the first time. Doctors from leading Covid hospitals in Ranchi, Jamshedpur and Dhanbad urged the harkhand government to set up isolation facilities for patients with mild or no symptom to rein in the rate of infectivition and reduce the burden on hospitals. They also suggested that nursing homes and smaller hospitals be converted to Covid hospitals and equipped with oxygen support and other paraphernalia to reduce the inflow at higher centres. “The new strain of the virus is highly infectious. Since mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients are in home isolation, other members of the family are getting infected as well. There is a need to increase the number of isolation centres. Smaller medical facilities should be equipped to treat patients to reduce the load at bigger hospitals,” Dr Vijay Mishra of Ranchi Medica Hospital said. Doctors from Tata Main Hospital in Jamshedpur and Dhanbad Medical College and Hospital expressed concerns over poor Remdesivir supply. “The availability of Remdisivir is a problem. We do not even have enough stock for a day,” Dr Rajan Choudhary, medical advisor at TMH, said. Several hospitals sought high flow nasal oxygen machines and ventilators from the government. The hospitals also flagged shortage of skilled manpower as a major concern. TMH, which has 530 Covid beds, said its doctors, nurses and paramedical staff are overworked and 180 of them have been infected. “Our hospital is fighting an acute manpower crunch, especially nurses, as they are joining government hospitals. I urge the government to halt their recruitment for now,” Dr S Mukhtar of Ranchi’s Medanta Hospital said. Soren directed Jitendra Kumar Singh, the head of the state oxygen task force, to create a reserve of 1,000 tonnes of oxygen at all the five oxygen manufacturing units in Jharkhand. “The companies must be told that they can supply to other states only after provisioning for Jharkhand’s requirement,” Soren said. He also directed officials to purchase 2,000 oxygen cylinders. Meanwhile, the government has also arranged for 1824 additional beds with oxygen support for treatment of Covid patients in districts other than Ranchi, a statement issued by the Information and Public Relation Department said on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hosps-seek-seamless-supply-of-o2-meds-docs/articleshow/82203156.cms||Dhritiman Ray

The district administration also got in touch with the state government and made sure that another Hazaribag-based private firm, which had applied for a licence long time ago for setting up an oxygen plant, got the required approval. “We learnt that a company named Maharshi Air Solution had applied for a licence long time ago but it was yet to receive it. We immediately coordinated with the chief secretary’s office to seek assistance and the firm has got the license now,” Anand said. Meanwhile, a private hospital named HZB Arogyam, which is a designated Covid care centre, has installed an oxygen plant in their premises and has begun manufacturing 52 cylinders on a daily basis. The hospital’s director, Harsh Ajmera, said that the plant’s current capacity is sufficient to meet their oxygen requirements. He added, “We began production around three days ago and none of our patients is facing any oxygen crisis now.” The district was facing an oxygen crisis a few weeks ago and had to depend on three factories in the neighbouring district of Ramgarh to meet its daily requirements. However, Anand said that the crisis was also due to the hoarding of oxygen cylinders. “We appeal to the people to refrain from hoarding oxygen cylinders. We are now planning to conduct raids and those found guilty will be penalised,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hmch-ties-up-with-pvt-firm-to-meet-oxygen-demand/articleshow/82202871.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The village has a population of nearly 400 and about 150 persons were tested on Thursday. Officials told TOI that they faced resistance from a section of villagers during the testing drive on Thursday. Govindpur BDO Santosh Kumar said, “A total of 150 persons underwent Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) for Covid-19 in the village, out of which 11 persons including one female were found to be positive. They were shifted to a Covid care centre at Nirsa.” Several villagers were reluctant in getting tested and did not cooperate with the administration as well as the medical team despite repeated requests. “Even those who were found to be positive were not ready to move to the hospital, as many of them were observing Roza during the month of Ramzan. We had a tough time in convincing them,” he added. Notably, four persons of a family died of Covid-like symptoms in quick succession in the village. An elderly person (82) also passed away on Wednesday, taking the tally to five. Officials said that teams will be deputed to keep a vigil in the area. They added that the testing drive will be carried out in the village on Friday as well to cover the remaining population. In another development, the district administration slapped a case under Section 51(B) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 on the basis of a written complaint by Dhanbad CO Prashant Kumar Layak against one Nandkishore for allegedly violating home isolation norms and travelling to his native place in Bihar without informing the authorities. Nandkishore, a resident of Housing colony in Bartand under Dhanbad had left for Konch in Gaya district of Bihar.

According to the vendors, over 55 of them were selling items ranging from litti-chokha, golgappa, chhat and fruit juice to south Indian delicacies like dosas and idlis near the Jubilee Park. Many officegoers and college students were among those who thronged these vendors to have a daily dose of their favourite snacks. However, since Holi, only 12 of them were doing business as many of them had shut because of the lack of customers after curbs, like no serving of customers at the vending site, work-from-home schemes and closure of shops by 8pm, were announced to check the rising number of infections. The existing vendors said their sales had dipped to nearly one-fourth of what they used to earn in normal times. Paswan, who ran a tea shop near the district BJP headquarters, said his sales had dipped to half after the Holi festival. He said, "I used to make tea using 15 to 18 litres of milk. Now, I hardly buy five to six litres. Many of my colleagues are now sitting at home without any earning." Rajesh Shah, a Chhola-bhature vendor, lamented that he is selling a maximum of Rs 15,000 worth of items a day, down from Rs 5,000 in normal times. Similarly, Rajendra Shao, a fruit juice stall owner, said the notification to close the shops at 8pm had reduced his income to just Rs 500. "Moreover, workers in these stalls are now jobless," Shao said, adding that the curbs are necessary but the government should come up with a relief package so that their families do not die of hunger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/steel-city-street-food-vendors-hit-hard-by-weeklong-lockdown/articleshow/82203320.cms||Debasish Chatterjee

The Jharkhand high court on Thursday asked the state government to look into the possibility of creating a 30-bed hospital for advocates at the high court premises. The direction was given by Chief Justice Dr Ravi Ranjan in pursuant to a petition filed by the Advocates Association of Jharkhand high court seeking an exclusive medical care arrangement for its members. Association secretary Navin Kumar said that in these times of crisis, beds were difficult to find for patients affected with the Covid-19 virus. “Advocates are also severely affected by the pandemic and have faced a lot of difficulties financially and otherwise. The Association only hopes to provide for basic medical attention for its members through the orders of the high court. There can be a provision of 30 beds arranged within the premises of the High Court with proper medical attention and care for the advocates,” Kumar said. He further mentioned that the Association does not seek any special care and attention from the high court but since the high court already has the infrastructure to set up a 30-bed infirmary, it will be the best possible alternative. “Moreover, there are already doctors who are posted specially in the high court who can be put to use along with paramedic staff to deal with the situation,” Kumar added. Meanwhile, the Jharkhand Police Association (JPA) on Thursday asked the government to reserve beds in government and private hospitals for its personnel for many of the coronavirus-infected cops are facing difficulties in getting admission in the Covid care centres. In a letter addressed to state health minister Banna Gupta, the JPA stated that while the police personnel are going out to perform their duty as frontline workers, many of them are getting infected and in turn, infecting their family members. “They are facing problems in getting beds in the hospitals,” the letter said. Speaking to TOI on the matter, JPA president Yogendra Singh said, “Given the current situation, five beds must be reserved for the police personnel in private and government hospitals each. A nodal officer must be appointed for the allocation of beds.” He added that the cops’ morale would get a boost if the government makes arrangements for their proper treatment. The JPA letter urged the government to convert the 80-bed hospital built for the Jharkhand Armed Police-10 battalion in Hotwar into a Covid centre by equipping it with the necessary infrastructure. “We tried to meet the health minister to press for our demands but he had other engagements,” JPA vice-president Akhileshwar Pandey said. As many as 150 policemen are down with Covid-19 at the moment and many of them are under home isolation. Around 35 are undergoing treatment at an isolation centre in a colony in Dhurwa, which was initially built for displaced people but is now being used to house the Covid-infected cops. In case anybody’s condition worsens, he is immediately shifted to a hospital. Meanwhile, continuing with its demand made last year, the JPA wrote to chief minister Hemant Soren, asking him to ensure an insurance coverage of Rs 50 lakh for the police personnel and also, accord martyr status to those succumbing to the disease. The letter stated that there is resentment among the police personnel because the government is neglecting their demands. JPA said that the policemen will work with renewed motivation if the CM takes a favourable decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cops-lawyers-demand-quota-in-hosp-beds-as-cov-crisis-deepens/articleshow/82202971.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Ranchi||IMA launches free Cov tele-consultancy||Jamshedpur: The Jamshedpur chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has launched a free tele-consultation facility for Covid patients in home isolation. Persons who are suffering from Covid or Covid-like symptoms can call a set of doctors on their mobile phones and seek advice relating to their treatment. Notably, the free consultancy has been introduced on the request of the district administration. The IMA functionary said individual doctors would be allotted time slots, otherwise they will receive calls round the clock. “Patients will be able to consult a few doctors now. We hope to add more doctors to the list soon,” the president of the Jamshedpur chapter of the IMA, Umesh Khan, said. Emphasizing that free consultancy is only for people who are either down with Covid-19 or experiencing symptoms, the veteran doctor urged the potential callers not to seek advice for non-COVID complications. “The purpose of having the facility will get diluted if people start seeking consultation for a variety of health ailments,” he said. There are over 2,000 practising doctors in the district, out of which 1,400 are members of the IMA. In the wake of the alarming rise in Covid numbers, DC Suraj Kumar had requested the organisation to provide tele-consultation service, Khan said. IMA Jamshedpur secretary Mrityunjay Kumar said the service will be available on all seven days of the week. Till Thursday afternoon, East Singhbhum recorded 26,737 Covid cases, of which 5.178 were active.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ima-launches-free-cov-tele-consultancy/articleshow/82202862.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Jail inspector general (IG) Birendra Bhushan said, “Healthy prisoners will be given green cards while those suffering from minor ailments will get a yellow one. Those with serious comorbidities like blood pressure, diabetes and heart ailments will be given a red card. The health status of green, yellow and red card-holders will be monitored on a monthly, fortnightly and weekly basis, respectively.” Bhushan has also instructed jails to set up isolation centres inside their premises, following which the Birsa Munda Central Jail in Hotwar, has converted a vacant unit meant for prisoners with mental disorders into one. He has also asked prisons to install oxygen beds in vacant flats or in the community halls on the jail premises to treat infected staff and prisoners. There are only eight doctors for 30 prisons across Jharkhand and the jail department has requested the state to depute more manpower. The department has also requested a vaccination drive to inoculate prisoners and said its paramedics could be trained for the same. The Covid prevention measures implemented by the department last year continue to remain in force. Prisoners are taken in only after a Covid test and new entrabts are kept separately for 14 days. All the prisoners are made to wear masks and maintain social distancing and the duration for them to make phone calls to their relatives has been increased. A slew of measures have also been implemented for protecting the jail staff. The security personnel deployed inside the premises are not posted outside and vice-versa. The staff working inside the jail campus have been told not to go out and the superintendents have been asked to arrange for groceries and other basic needs of the staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/colour-card-system-to-help-monitor-health-of-vulnerable-prisoners-in-jharkhand/articleshow/82202914.cms||Sanjay Sahay

Chief minister Hemant Soren, in a video message, asked the people to exercise restraint and abide by the directives, which will be in place till April 29. “This was the only way to slow down the infectivity in the state. I am sure that the transmission of the virus will slow down,” he said. Unlike March last year, when nationwide lockdown was imposed, there was no panic buying in grocery stores and other commercial establishments on Thursday. Ranchi administration remained vigilant since morning. Deputy commissioner Chhavi Ranjan and SSP Surendra Kumar Jha led a flag march from Albert Ekka Chowk to the Railway overbridge stretch of the Main Road and took stock of the preparations. Commercial establishments and commuters were warned against flouting the rules. Meanwhile, chief secretary Sukhdev Singh, while speaking to the doctors from various hospitals, clarified that movement of all passenger and commercial vehicles to and from the state will remain functional as usual. “If the hospitals or any other medical institutes complain of difficulty in procuring equipment, the Jharkhand government will provide necessary assistance,” Singh said. The state government had on April 20 said that vaccine drives will continue amid the curbs. However, when contacted to know the measures which are being put in place to ensure passage of beneficiaries to vaccination centres, officials in the health department did not take calls. While commercial establishments will remain shut, PDS shops, drug stores, liquor stores, petrol pumps, vegetable markets, milk booths, e-commerce services, vehicle repair shops, banks, ATM kiosks will remain open. Union government offices, state government offices, electricity, urban local bodies, block and circle offices, among others, will remain functional. Banks will remain open between 10am and 4pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hemant-urges-restraint-as-jkhand-shuts-down-for-a-week/articleshow/82203175.cms||Dhritiman Ray

In a letter to Modi, she said the differential pricing of vaccines as announced by the Serum Institute (SII) following the new government policy implies that “government of India has abdicated its responsibility to provide free vaccination for citizens between 18-45 years”. “In these unprecedented times, how can the government permit such brazen profiteering from people’s misery?” she asked. Meanwhile, Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel also wrote to Modi, saying it would be judicious if the price of vaccines to be supplied to the Centre and the states is the same. “After the Centre decided that everyone above 18 years can be vaccinated, the Chhattisgarh government has decided to provide vaccination free of cost to all adults in our state,” he wrote. “Since Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin has been developed with the cooperation of the government, it should be cheaper than the one developed by SII,” he suggested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sonia-calls-vaccine-pricing-brazen-profiteering-from-misery/articleshow/82206820.cms||---
---||Nagpur||VIA Lady Entrepreneur’s wing conducts webinar on Covid-19||Nagpur: Vidarbha Industries Association (VIA) Lady Entrepreneur’s Wing on Tuesday conducted a webinar on ‘Health management during Covid-19 and health insurance’. In two sessions, Dr Rajshree Khot (AIIMS) and Nitin Jeswani (director of JP Insurance Brokers pvt Ltd) spoke in detail about the topic and advised people on the best course of action. Dr Khot touched upon every medical aspect of the pandemic including physical, mental, children’s health and social well-being. “When it comes to physical health, one should have an insight of one’s illness. Always have a stock of required medicines with self. In case one is not able to go to the doctor, then consult the doctor on phone and get prescription on mail/WhatsApp. The medicines can be bought through any website,” said Dr Khot. She said seasonal diseases which are mild can be treated at home by teleconsulting the doctor, but in case of major diseases and surgeries, one must go to the hospitals. She emphasized on diet control and exercise, and tackling stress by learning new skills like cooking and singing etc. “The current situation has brought the entire families close enabling them to spend quality time together,” she said. On mental health, Dr Khot said, “Mental stress is a man-made phenomenon and one has to come out of it with self efforts. To tackle mental stress, one has to practice mindfulness – i.e. think of present only without bothering about the future as we have to go with the time.” On social well-being, she said that one should always be a force for positive change. On children’s health, she said, “You have to make sure that the children quickly adapt to the new normal of wearing masks, hand washing, a bit of physical distancing, as we cannot go to old normal. You have to help your child stay active and have to develop new parental skills.” Dr Khot also touched upon the aspect of post Covid care and vaccination. In the second session, Nitin Jeswani spoke on making people aware on how they can safeguard their families and businesses from the financial liabilities. He explained why one should have health insurance. Besides, he also explained the difference between health and Covid insurance. He also gave details about group employee health insurance. Rashmi Kulkarni, treasurer, introduced Jeswani. Manisha Bawankar, chairperson, VIA LEW, made the opening remarks and welcomed the guests. Prominently present were VIA’s past president Anita Rao, secretary Poonam Lala, treasurer Rashmi Kulkarni, executive members Sarla Kamdar, Prafullata Rode, Madhubala Singh and Sarita Pawar.

The division bench of the high court, comprising Chief Justice Thottathil B Radhakrishnan and Justice Shampa Sarkar, passed a judgment dismissing several contempt petitions filed against Lodha for continuing as a director and chairman in four listed group companies — Birla Corporation, Universal Cables, Vindhya Telelinks and Birla Cable, according to a statement issued by the Lodhas. Last year, Birlas had filed contempt petitions against Lodha on his continuation on the boards of the M P Birla Group companies, alleging violation of an order passed by a division Bench of the Calcutta high court on October 1, 2020. The division bench of the high court, in its October 1 order, did not grant any stay on the single bench’s order, which had restrained Lodha from holding any office in any of the entities of the group during pendency of the suit involving the contested will of late Priyamvada Devi Birla, the widow of M P Birla. The verdict of the division bench of the high court on Thursday “cleared the decks” for Harsh Vardhan Lodha to continue as the chairman of all companies of the MP Birla Group, said Lodha’s advocate Debanjan Mandal, partner, Fox & Mandal. “Our client is deeply grateful to the highest honorable court of the state for this resounding victory...In the past two years, relentless attacks have been mounted, not only on Mr Lodha, but also on the independent directors and executives of the MP Birla Group companies. Thursday’s verdict vindicates the highest level of governance standards maintained in these companies from the times of the late Madhav Prasad Birla,” Mandal added. “The court today dismissed the contempt applications filed against HV Lodha and others. We are awaiting the copy of the order passed today and would decide the future course of action after studying the same,” N G Khaitan, a Birla counsel, said. The 17-year-old legal battle between the Birlas and the Lodhas over the control of the Rs 5,000-crore Birla Estate lies in the contested will of late Priyamvada Devi Birla, which was executed in July 1982 after the ‘purported will’ allegedly transferred the shares of the M P Birla Group, collectively called as the Birla Estate, in favour of Rajendra Singh Lodha, the father Harsh Vardhan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hc-no-to-birlas-plea-lodha-remains-mp-birla-head/articleshow/82204022.cms||---
---||India||In year of Covid, bonded labour found roots again||NEW DELHI: Santosh Majhi had accepted his lot in life. Rs 10 a day for 16 hours of work at the brick kiln in Telangana’s Peddapalli. Home was far away in Odisha and seemed further away with each passing day. Like others in his village, he had believed the man who promised to pay off his debt in exchange for work. A year in, he had realised he was in bondage. But when the representative of a human rights organisation got in touch, he and the 360 others with him refused to leave. “They were not willing. They said there was too much poverty back home, money lenders would hound them and all prospects of jobs had dried up because of the pandemic. So, they had decided to simply submit to the atrocities,” Dr K Krishnan, executive director of Foundation for Sustainable Development, which eventually did rescue them, told TOI. This was in June 2020. A year in, this seems to have turned into a recurring pattern — migrant workers who have been sold into bonded labour would rather stay in bondage than leave because home holds no hope. Like at a village in Pattukkottai in Tamil Nadu’s Thanjavur district last month. A boy, 9, had been engaged as a bonded goat herder for two years. “When we first spoke to him, he said the employer was his father,” P Jai Edilbert, programme officer of SHED-India, an organisation that works on child and women’s rights, told TOI. He remembered nothing of his family — after his mother died in the 2018 Gaja cyclone, he had been sold off for Rs 1 lakh by his jobless father. There was no home to go back to. Until 2019, three things contributed to the prevalence of bonded labour — traffickers looked for those who were poor, or illiterate, and often chose people from indigenous communities. But now, a fourth category has become the most sought after — the migrant worker. “It’s easy to exploit them. The first barrier is language. They can’t ask locals for help. Then, because they are in an unfamiliar place, they cannot plan an escape. Finally, even if they run away, they have to take a bus or train to get home. They can easily be caught there,” Krishnan explained. Resources going into discovery of cases have also dipped. In response to a question in the Lok Sabha, Union minister of state for labour and employment Santosh Gangwar replied on March 22 that the allocation for surveys to detect bonded labour cases had been about Rs 60 lakh in 2018-19, which dipped to just about a quarter of that in 2020-2021, about Rs 16 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-year-of-covid-bonded-labour-found-roots-again/articleshow/82206819.cms||Chandrima Banerjee

Which means that once, and if, proof of vaccination becomes a mandatory, fully-vaccinated Indians will be able to show a globally acceptable proof on their mobiles. “Our verifiable digital vaccination certificates are downloadable and can be stored on mobiles. We are aligning this process with global standards so that they are internationally acceptable,” Sharma said. “Our certificates are already digitised. After the first jab, people get a provisional certificate. And after the second jab, the final certificate is issued.

The state has also banned all non-essential gatherings. “All shops will remain closed from 6pm onward in Haryana from tomorrow (Friday), all non-essential gatherings are banned, anybody holding any function within the prescribed limit will have to seek permission from concerned SDM (sub-divisional magistrate),” Vij, who also holds the home portfolio, said in a tweet. However, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar later clarified that standalone stores located in less crowded areas would be exempted from the revised timings. “But deputy commissioner of each district will take a final decision on this.” Haryana had recently capped the number of attendees at indoor events to 50 and in open spaces to 200 and imposed night curfew from 10pm to 5am. Speaking to TOI, Vij said that the decision to close shops by 6pm was taken to keep people indoors. “The night curfew is already in place but people still go out in the evenings as the markets are open. The closure of shops in the evening will discourage people from venturing out.” He said the state government has also banned non-essential gatherings and the organiser of any function, within prescribed limit, will have to seek permission from the sub-divisional magistrate of their area. However, when asked, deputy commissioner of Gurugram, Yash Garg, said he was yet to receive order from the state government in this regard. “We will arrange for strict implementation of the order as soon as the state government issues it on Friday.” On April 12, the government imposed a night curfew in the state from 9pm to 5am, but later the night timing was relaxed by an hour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/in-haryana-curfew-hours-to-begin-at-6pm-from-today/articleshow/82205042.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh

Deaths in Mumbai climbed to 75 on Thursday, the highest this year. While 29 deaths were among those below 60 years of age in Mumbai, six victims were below 40. The city's toll has climbed to 12,583 and the tally to over six lakh. Maharashtra added 67,013 cases on Thursday, taking the tally to 40.9 lakh. In April so far, the state has added 7,551 deaths, while Mumbai has added 893 deaths. Dr Avinash Supe, a member of the task force on Covid deaths, said Mumbai's death rate is inching towards 1% after having dropped to 0.2% earlier this year. At 127 deaths, MMR has highest toll in the stateThere are multiple reasons for the rising deaths in the city. “People struggle to get beds, resulting in delayed start of treatment. Many go to smaller centres that are not able to help patients adequately,” Supe said. Dr Rahul Pandit, who heads the ICU department at Fortis Hospital, Mulund, and is a member of the state government’s task force on Covid-19, said the deaths will continue to worsen for another week or more. “People who were infected a fortnight back and failed to improve are most vulnerable,” he said. The strain causing the second wave is deadlier and more infectious than the first one. “During the first wave, lung disease worsened in the second week. But we now get patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome within six days of the start of symptoms. The deterioration is very swift, especially among the younger people,” said Dr Pandit. He said while patients, mostly middle class and wellinformed about Covid, diligently check their oxygen saturation on the pulse oximeter, they never do the six-minute walk test. “The six-minute walk should be done twice every day. If the count after the six-minute walk is 3% lower than the baseline score, it is time to get hospitalised,” he said. Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) reported 127 deaths, the highest in the state. The daily toll in Panvel doubled in the last 24 hours. Compared to eight deaths on Wednesday, 19 patients succumbed on Thursday. The Panvel toll has now reached 776. Panvel civic Commissioner Sudhakar Deshmukh said reporting of Covid deaths by hospitals gets delayed as they have to ascertain the cause of death. Meanwhile, NMMC reported 809 cases and eight deaths on Thursday, taking the Covid case count to 88,034 and the toll to 1,300. Kalyan-Dombivli city reported new 1,670 cases and nine deaths, taking the tally to 1.1 lakh and toll to 1,322 deaths. A senior official from the state government said that with cases in smaller cities surging and patients ignoring symptoms, deaths are going up in those areas as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbais-toll-soars-to-75-maharashtra-adds-568-deaths-again/articleshow/82206891.cms||Malathy Iyer

He said the state has industrial units to produce about 510 metric tonne oxygen per day. He said the government was taking all measures to take the entire required quota from the industries in the state for local consumption before allowing the units to transport to other states. The minister took stock of the issues involved in oxygen production and transport with senior officials and plant managements on Thursday. Speaking to the media, Mekapati said that availability of oxygen in time was one of the vital game changers in the fight against Covid-19 . “We have reviewed strategies for the optimum use of oxygen for the treatment of Covid-19 patients as well as critical industrial productions which also have the impact on the livelihood of many people,” said Mekapati. He said the government has come to the conclusion after taking the experiences of the last year into account that the state would require about 200-300 MT oxygen per day during the peak. The minister said that the present demand is around 80 MT to 100 MT per day. He explained that the state has about 40 oxygen manufacturing units, with a total capacity of 510 MT per day. “About 430 MT can be completely utilized / diverted for producing medical oxygen. Some entrepreneurs have also come forward, if need arises, ready to convert their industrial oxygen units to medical oxygen units,” said Mekapati. He directed the officials to prepare an action plan to transport and supply oxygen across the state without delay. About 80 MT oxygen is ready in RINL and ready to be dispatched whenever required. He said that the government is also sourcing about 100 MT from Bhubaneswar and Chennai. He said that they have to strike the balance and need to take care of critical industries as well. He asked the officials to monitor the day-to-day supply of oxygen and see that the demand is matched. The minister directed the officials to give top priority to supply oxygen to districts reporting high positivity rate of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/no-oxygen-shortage-in-ap-assures-industries-minister/articleshow/82202563.cms||Samdani MN
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Oxygen demand sees early rise in second wave||VISAKHAPATNAM: Demand for medical oxygen from over 200 hospitals treating Covid-19 patients has risen earlier in the second wave than in the first. In the first wave, oxygen demand peaked in August. But this time, the demand has started increasing from April itself and is expected to rise further in subsequent months, say agencies refilling oxygen cylinders. On Wednesday, a total of 7,533 bulk oxygen cylinders with total capacity of 75 tonnes were refilled at refilling plants across the state. Vingas Industries Pvt Ltd, one of the 32 oxygen refilling plants in the state, refilled the highest — 2,412 cylinders, approximately 22.2 tonnes. Speaking to TOI, Vingas director B Srinivas said that having produced 2,412 cylinders in a single day, the company surpassed its record of 2,295 cylinders in August last year. Dr PV Sudhakar, principal of Andhra Medical College (AMC) and Covid-19 special officer for north AP, said that if all hospital beds in Visakhapatnam were to be filled with Covid-19 patients, the district would need 50 tonnes of medical oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/oxygen-demand-sees-early-rise-in-second-wave/articleshow/82202569.cms||V Kamalakara Rao

Produced by the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP), the oxygen sent from Vizag is expected to cater to the needs of at least 10,000 Covid-19 patients. The cylinders were sent to Mumbai on a ‘roll on roll off’ basis of the Indian Railways through the country’s first Oxygen Express. Speaking to TOI, a VSP official said, “The train was supposed to reach here on Wednesday but got delayed due to various reasons. We have filled oxygen and flagged-off the train for Mumbai on Thursday evening.” 100 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen, enough for 10,000 oxygen cylinders have been sent. VSP has created a separate ramp for the facility. Seven empty cryogenic tankers with total carrying capacity of over 100 tonnes were checked as per protocol before the train left for Mumbai. Wailtair railway division’s senior commercial manager AK Tripathi said, “In the second wave, the railways has come forward to run the Oxygen Express to supply medical oxygen from various steel plants to different parts of the country. During the first wave, we initiated conversion of some trains into isolation wards.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/oxygen-exp-leaves-vizag-for-mum/articleshow/82202582.cms||V Kamalakara Rao

Authorities fear that the crowded environments may turn stockyards into Covid-19 hotspots. What’s even more concerning is that many workers are refusing to wear masks or maintain distance despite instructions from managers of these stockyards. Sources inform that municipal commissioners have noticed several Covid-19 cases being reported from colonies where daily wagers in civil supplies corporation live. At least 20 per cent workers in Srikakulam, Nellore, Chittoor and Kurnool have tested positive for Covid-19, say sources. This has become a cause for worry among stockyard staff. “Senior officials are not even bothered about spraying of disinfectants in stockyards and providing required number of sanitisers. They are simply chasing us to reach targets of releasing stocks,” said a stockyard manager in Krishna district. The AP State Civil Supplies Corporation Limited (APSCSCL) has more than 600 stockyards across the state. At least 40–50 daily wagers are associated with every stockyard where goods are weighed and dispatched to ration shops. The unhygienic conditions at stockyards were a cause for concern even before the pandemic outbreak. There are no dedicated cleaning staff for premises which handle very large quantities of food and other essentials. Speaking about the steps being taken by the administration, Prakasam district collector Pola Bhaskar said, “We have instructed the district manager of civil supplies corporation to ensure that Covid-19 protocols are followed by workers at any cost.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/maskless-workers-in-crowded-stockyards-worry-civic-bodies/articleshow/82202614.cms||Samdani MN

The “double mutant” is said to be responsible for the sudden spike in the number of cases in Maharashtra and other parts of the country. Scientists earlier feared that this “double mutant”, or B.1.617, may escape the immune system and thus vaccines may not offer protection from this strain of the novel coronavirus.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); However, studies by ICMR on Covaxin found that it offers protection from the new mutant. “Covishield protects against B.1.617. Early results using in vitro neutralisation assay show that both convalescent (prior infection) sera and Covishield-vaccinated sera offer protection against the B.1.617 variant, aka double mutant,” said CCMB director Rakesh Kumar Mishra. He, however, added in his tweet that it was a very preliminary, but encouraging, result.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); “Double mutant” is a misnomer as this particular variant carries not double, or two mutations, but as many as 15 mutations, say experts. It has been found to be in about 60 to 70% of cases in Maharashtra, but in less than 5% of cases in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covishield-may-protect-against-double-mutant-ccmb-report/articleshow/82206892.cms||Syed Akbar

The committee will meet chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on Friday and brief him on the present situation. A final decision on the next course of action would be taken by the CM. The committee asked private hospitals to follow the price list prescribed by the government for treatment of Covid patients and vaccination for others. It warned the hospitals of severe action if they fail to adhere to the prices fixed by the government and other guidelines. The committee also made an appeal to people to follow all Covid guidelines and wear masks when going out, observe physical distancing, and avoid being in groups. Minister for health and deputy chief minister Alla Kalikrishna Srinivas (Nani) urged people not to panic but strictly follow the guidelines to check the spread of the virus. He said the supply of vaccine doses to the state has not been satisfactory, but added that the chief minister has already written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking more doses which he said would arrive soon. He further said that there is no shortage of oxygen in government hospitals in the state, but wanted private hospitals to have required the required oxygen stocks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cabinet-sub-committee-takes-stock-of-covid-situation-in-ap/articleshow/82202617.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Over 1 lakh Covid patients treated for free in private hospitals||VISAKHAPATNAM: A total of 1,00,033 Covid-19 patients have received free treatment for Covid-19 in various private hospitals in Andhra Pradesh under the Aarogya Sri scheme, the flagship healthcare scheme of the state government. The government has spent Rs 309 crore on bills. Within days of the Covid-19 outbreak in Andhra Pradesh, the state government included the disease in the list of illnesses covered under Aarogyasri. 49-year-old Ramanaiah Manda was one such beneficiary of the scheme. A resident of Nellore, he availed free treatment at Apollo Speciality Hospitals. The government approved a sum of Rs 5,87,534 for him. Similarly, 58-year-old Sheikh Nazeer was approved a bill of Rs 4,68,312. Since the healthcare scheme is only available to those whose annual income is less than Rs 5 lakh, one can only imagine the amount of financial stress these families would be under if they were to clear the bills themselves. Similar stories can be found in almost every district of Andhra Pradesh. The scheme, intended to protect people from falling into the debt trap due to medical bills, seems to have indeed helped saved lives of the poor. Under the scheme, all individuals possessing an Aarogyasri card can avail free healthcare services at listed hospitals if the bill exceeds Rs 1,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/over-1-lakh-covid-patients-treated-for-free-in-pvt-hosps/articleshow/82202634.cms||---

The collector met managements of Covid-empanelled private hospitals and senior officials appointed nodal officers of these hospitals at the Zilla Parishad meeting hall on Thursday. The collector said, “Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has expressed dissatisfaction over a few private hospitals not admitting patients even though they have empty beds and also for not keeping necessary stock of medicines.” The collector said that the chief minister has issued instructions to seize hospitals violating norms. Around 40 private hospitals have come forward to extend services to Covid-19 patients. These hospitals have been categorised into two groups —A and B.

---||Vijayawada||Body count up in Guntur burial grounds||GUNTUR: With increase in the number of Covid-19 fatalities, burial grounds in Guntur are getting more bodies for last rites in the last three days. Sources said each of the three major Hindu burial grounds have handled at least 40 to 50 bodies per day in the last four days. Normally, managers at cremation centres would not insist for a medical certificate to allow the final rites. However, the family members who were taking the bodies to the burial grounds were citing heart attack or brain stroke as reason for death while making entry in the register at the burial grounds. “There is increase in Covid-19 related deaths in the last one week. There were at least 50 bodies per day in the last two days,” said Swamy Jnana Prasanna of Amma Charitable Trust in the city. He said they would not insist on people to cite the reason for the death as there are no such rules. He said they were handling orphan bodies where there would be no one to answer their queries. “We used to receive two to three bodies a day in the past. However, the number went up last week as we got calls from the public to perform the funerals as the victims were Covid-19 patients and close family members were not coming forward perform the rites,” said Swamy. The situation is similar at Muslim and Christian burial grounds in the city. Sources said majority of the deaths were taking place in hospitals which were returning the bodies in sealed plastic pack. The official bulletin of the state government, however, says there are only three to four Covid-19 deaths per day. Sources said the deaths took place in government hospitals were only gaining entry into the official records while private hospitals are certifying the deaths as due to cardiac arrest or brain stroke related deaths. Municipal commissioner C Anuradha directed municipal health officer (MHO) Venkata Ramana to probe the issue and submit a report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/body-count-up-in-guntur-burial-grounds/articleshow/82202648.cms||Samdani MN
---||Goa||Goa: No monitoring, say patients in home isolation||PANAJI: With the health system overwhelmed, Covid positive people in home isolation have stated that their condition is not being adequately monitored, often leaving them to fend for themselves. A woman in South Goa, who tested positive recently, said she was forced to consult a private doctor after her fever and coughing continued for almost a week. “I was not given a number of any health services doctor, but managed to get the number. I Whatsapped my details but I didn’t receive any reply. Till today, the doctor hasn’t checked or responded to my message,” she told TOI. She then approached a private practitioner, who volunteered during the last wave of Covid as well, for guidance. “We require a little guidance as each one’s symptoms are different. I’m grateful I recovered,” she said. In another instance, a Porvorim resident received only one call from the administration asking her the reason for her applying for home isolation, whether there were any other positive persons in her home and the date of testing. “How are we supposed to know if we are fine or not? We need someone to guide us and tell us what precautions to take. Since they have our contact numbers they should just call to ask about our symptoms. I still haven’t received any official confirmation that I tested positive. I found out through sources in the health services. Four days is too long to wait for a report. A person’s condition can worsen in four days. It has come to a stage where each one must take care of themselves,” she said. Another Porvorim woman, who applied for home isolation recently, called up the health services doctor. But found that the doctor assigned to her is attached to the Candolim health centre. “I was told Porvorim was not his jurisdiction and he gave me the contact of the doctor in-charge, but my case hadn’t reached that doctor either,” she told TOI. “The doctor responded and told me to get in touch only if I had serious symptoms, but added that there was nothing that they could do if I turned breathless and that a relative would have to take me to the hospital. There was no monitoring of oxygen levels, so I turned to a private doctor friend for help. The symptoms of Covid are very deceiving and although health services are overwhelmed, I feel our condition or at least our oxygen levels should be monitored if not every day then at least every two or three days,” she told TOI. Those who apply for home isolation receive telephone calls two to three times a day from doctors at health centres, health services director Dr Jose D’Sa told reporters on Thursday. GMC dean and Covid hospitals in-charge Dr S Bandekar said that people can directly contact health services doctors, including the deputy director Dr Geeta Kakodkar and himself for advice. “They can also call our helpline 104,” he said. The health services director said there are currently more than 9,000 people under home isolation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-monitoring-say-patients-in-home-isolation/articleshow/82204618.cms||Lisa Monteiro

From an average of 9,000 footfalls on weekdays, just 2,300 passengers are now passing through the terminal building. With India’s daily Covid-19 caseload hitting record levels and with states imposing curbs, more and more fliers are reluctant to travel. On Thursday, 36 flights were cancelled by private airlines. “There are just 2,300-2,600 passengers at the airport on a daily basis now. As cases increase, passengers don’t want to take a risk,” Goa airport director Gagan Malik said. Most of the flights that have been cancelled are linked to the metros and those that either depart or land between 9pm and 6am. While AAI officials have been making regular announcements regarding appropriate Covid-19 norms, they have also been levying fines on fliers found without masks within the terminal. AI has taken steps to mitigate the spread of Covid-19. Non-operations staff have been asked to report for duty on a rotational basis and to work from home on alternate days. “Operational staff cannot be reduced because they have to do their duty,” said Malik. While the state as announced a partial night curfew, AAI has clarified that the airport remains operational and that the there is no restriction on public transport or taxis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-goa-imposes-curbs-passengers-cancel-flights/articleshow/82204643.cms||Newton Sequeira

---||Goa||Goa SEC gives nod to continue vaccination in civic poll areas||PANAJI/MARGAO: Miscommunication on the government’s part resulted in people having to return home without vaccinations on Thursday morning as vaccination centres closed temporarily in areas where elections are due to be held. At the TB hospital in Margao, a notice which read ‘Covid-19 vaccination suspended from April 21 5pm till further notice due to code of conduct arising from municipal elections’ left citizens baffled. The vaccinations resumed at around 1pm. Director of health services Dr Jose D’Sa said it was a “misunderstanding”. The Goa state  commission (SEC) on Thursday granted permission to the state government to continue the Covid vaccination programme beyond April 21 in the municipal areas of Mapusa, Mormugao, Margao, Sanguem and Quepem, where elections are scheduled on Friday. Campaigning for the municipal polls ended on April 21. However, the SEC warned that the vaccination drive would be suspended if the model code of conduct was violated. As per the Centre’s guidelines, on April 14, the SEC had granted permission only until April 21, up to 5pm, to conduct Covid vaccination in municipal areas where elections are scheduled. The SEC has stated that following a request from the directorate of health services for continuing the Covid vaccination programme from April 22 onwards, the commission has granted permission for the same. The SEC will monitor the vaccination programme and check whether it is carried out in an apolitical manner, and leaflets or banners or appeals on social media of any programme by candidates, party functionaries, will be strictly prohibited. The commission has instructed both the district collectors, the municipal council election officer, returning officers for general election to the municipal councils of Mapusa, Mormugao, Margao, Sanguem and Quepem, and general observers to report any violations during the Covid vaccination programme. “If there are any violations, the vaccination programme will be suspended immediately after duly examining the violations reported,” the SEC stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sec-gives-nod-to-continue-vax-in-civic-poll-areas/articleshow/82204672.cms||---

Dean Goa Medical College and in-charge Covid hospitals, Dr S Bandekar said that although the vaccine is not 100%, it is proven to reduce the severity of Covid-19. “We’ve seen that the severity of symptoms are less in those who have taken the vaccine. Their pneumonia is less and threat to life is less. That’s why people should take it…as an immunity booster plus it gives you a good sense of resistance to the virus and I tell you again to take care as this virus is not normal. We will get sequencing done, but before that, from the cases and deaths we have seen, this wave if powerful,” he told reporters. Bandekar said vaccination is the only way by which the population can be saved during this second wave. Around 35 healthcare workers have got Covid after taking the vaccination because “they’re re-exposed to it, working in Covid areas”, he said. Dhawan said vaccinations would continue to be provided free to all even those above the age of 18 from May 1. If required, the number of vaccination centres will be increased and timings extended to accommodate more beneficiaries, he added. Director of health services Dr Jose D’Sa said there are 37 vaccination centres and 25 private centres offering the vaccine. He said 8,737 were administered the vaccine on Thursday. Till date a total of 2.7 lakh doses have been administered where 2.1 lakh have taken their first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/not-one-person-who-took-the-vax-died-health-secy/articleshow/82204680.cms||---

The halt in private car and bike registrations could hit the economy, which was recovering from the slump during Covid last year. “We are registering transport vehicles and completing pending work which can be done online,” Dhakne said. There are special directives to register on priority essential service vehicles, which will be required for medical and other emergencies during Covid-19, such as ambulances. Another official said, “With the shutdown in registrations and uncertainty over whether lockdown will be lifted on May 1, it will not only hit private vehicle registrations but the automobile industry too. At least 4,200 cars and bikes will not be registered due to the shutdown during these 10 days.” Expired driving licences to be now valid till June 30: StateThose who have booked vehicles will have to wait for dealers to get them registered, and this will only begin once we get orders from government,” said the official. Transport statistics during Covid (April 2020-March 2021) show around 3,487 private cars and 9,374 bikes were registered every month (12,861 cars and bikes every month). The numbers were higher during pre-Covid times, when an average 4,038 cars and 13,404 two-wheelers were registered at the four city RTOs. The vehicular population in Mumbai recently crossed 40 lakh, with 11.6 lakh private cars and nearly 24 lakh twowheelers registered at Mumbai RTOs. A year back, RTO operations for vehicle registrations were shut due to Covid, which led to drop in vehicle registrations in the year, an official said. In a new circular, transport department announced that driving licences and permits which expired will be valid till June 30. It stated that “no new application will be accepted for duplicate licence and renewal of licences till further notice. But old applications on Saarthi software will be processed online and completed.” Similarly, renewal of fitness certificates will be mainly for essential vehicles, which are allowed on the road as per a government notification. Meanwhile, RTO has banned visitors. “We do not want anyone to visit office. We will work with few staff as per a government notification,” a regional transport officer from Mumbai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/all-private-car-registrations-in-maharashtra-cancelled-till-may-1/articleshow/82206943.cms||Somit Sen
---||Goa||Goa: With second Ramzan in pandemic, Muslims say better prepared, take cautious approach||PANAJI: Muslims in the state are navigating their daily fasts and rituals associated with the holy month of Ramzan. This being the second consecutive year of the holy month, in the pandemic, believers this year are better experienced in the face of rising cases. “We are much more prepared than last year. Last Ramzan, my parents-in-law were stuck in Mumbai, but this year, they are back in Goa, so we have the joy of observing fasts together,” Altinho resident, Mariyam S K said. “We run a cafe which would usually be full in the evening, so we had to do our Iftar at the cafe itself. Now due to the pandemic, there’s less crowd so we can peacefully do iftar at home.” Navelim-resident, Safaz Sayed said. Last year, the coronavirus upended people’s routine of going to the mosque for iftaar and the Eidgah namaz. This year is no different despite the mosque doors being open. “Though mosques are open compared to last Ramzan, there is drop in footfalls since most prefer offering prayers from home, especially those that have children and elderly in their family,” said Bashir Ahmed, president of the association of the All Goa Muslim Jamaat. “Children particularly would be excited to eat the iftaar feast, but this year we’ve not had many children coming in despite regularly sanitising the mosques and observing social distancing. If the government order is issued to ban religious congregation, we will not hold the Eidgah,” he said. Tivim resident Zain Khwaja hasn’t visited the mosque since the lockdown in March 2020 to keep his 88-year-old grandmother safe. “We have been observing our prayers at home itself. The Eidgah namaz will also be performed privately at home like last year. We have all adapted to the new way of life since last year,” he said. Panaji-based Ambrin Beig would always look forward to the holy month owing to the feasts. “Previous years used to fill us with a lot excitement which we particularly miss as we would share our meals with our neighbours and even have iftar get-togethers for our non-Muslim friends,” she said. Like last year, Panaji-resident Mohammed Rashid will not be inviting friends over and will distribute biryani parcels among friends and neighbours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-second-ramzan-in-pandemic-muslims-say-better-prepared-take-cautious-approach/articleshow/82204721.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Noida||Remdesivir hoarder part of 4-member gang: Noida cops||NOIDA: After the arrest of a 31-year-old Delhi resident for alleged black marketing of Remdesivir, cops suspect that he was actually part of a four-member gang that used to directly source the drug from registered suppliers in Delhi and Chandigarh. TOI has learnt that the Noida police are now working to track down the other three members of the group. Rachit Ghai was in possession of 100 vials of the Remdesivir injection when he was arrested. He was allegedly selling each jab for anywhere between Rs 15,000 and Rs 40,000 since March, finding most of his customers through WhatsApp groups. “Rachit had some links with a production unit in Delhi and he mediated between a Delhi-based supplier and a Maharashtra-based chemist and made good money out of the deal. However, this increased his greed and he thought that sourcing the injections and black marketing would be a good idea and decided to sell them at a high margin,” said a police officer privy to the investigation. While the UP chief minister said on Wednesday that those resorting to black marketing of the Remdesivir injection and oxygen cylinders would be booked under the Gangster Act and NSA, the Noida police say any such decision will be made once the gang is established and other members are arrested. “Only then we can think about imposing the Gangster Act on the accused,” additional CP (law and order) Love Kumar said. So far, cops are clear about the batch number of the injection and have established where the injection was pilfered from, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/remdesivir-hoarder-part-of-4-member-gang-cops/articleshow/82204813.cms||Shikha Salaria

Director Dilip Bhagat has, however, said that teachers will continue to attend duty in schools as usual. The circular comes a day after the state government imposed a series of curbs to control Covid-19 spread in Goa, which included suspending any permission to schools to hold physical classes for students. “It is to inform you that due to the spike in the pandemic all offline/physical classes of the institutions coming under the jurisdiction of this directorate shall remain closed till April 30, 2021. However, teaching and non-teaching staff shall continue to attend school as before,” Bhagat said in the circular, issued to primary, middle, secondary and higher secondary government, aided and unaided schools. The circular comes into effect immediately. Online classes should go on as usual, he said. Meanwhile, the Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education also followed up the government announcement to postpone the Class X and XII exams with a circular enforcing the same. The executive council of the Goa Board has convened a meeting on Friday at 3pm to discuss its future course of action over conduct of the deferred exams. “Fresh dates will be announced 15 days prior to commencement of examination adhering to the guidelines issued by the government,” the Goa Board circular stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/doe-no-physical-classes-teachers-to-work-as-usual/articleshow/82204795.cms||---

She questioned why states would have to pay “167% more” for the same purpose and expressed fear that this would trigger “unscrupulous mechanisms in the market”. She wrote that the price differentiation was “unheard of in Indian history”. “One nation, one party, one leader shouts BJP all the time but to save lives they can’t have one price for vaccine”, she tweeted. It also announced its decision to fix a price of Rs 400 per jab for state governments and Rs 600 for private hospitals.

---||Nashik||Day after tragedy, all 157 beds at Nashik hospital occupied||NASHIK: The oxygen leak tragedy at Zakir Hussain Hospital in Nashik on Wednesday has had little impact on the flow of patients at the medical facility. A day later, on Thursday, all 157 hospital beds in the hospital continue to be occupied and 22 patients were on the waiting list. Some patients were also being given medical support in the corridors of the hospital. Twenty-two Covid-19 patients lost their lives at the hospital on Wednesday after oxygen supply was disrupted for over an hour due to the leak. A visit to the hospital on Thursday revealed that the flow of patients was continuous and critically ill Covid patients were being brought in autorickshaws and private vehicles all throughout the day. Hospital staff said patients lying on the floor would be given beds once they are vacant. A doctor at the entrance of the hospital said: “All 157 beds of the hospital are occupied and there are over 22 patients waiting. The stream of patients coming in remains as usual.” Another staffer of the hospital said admission to Covid hospitals has become a problem everywhere, which brings patients not getting admission elsewhere to government facilities. The situation has been such for over a year now, he added. Meanwhile, against the backdrop of Wednesday’s incident and the possibility of VVIP visits, the city police maintained a strict bandobast at the entrance of the hospital on Thursday. Only patients and their relatives were allowed inside.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/day-after-tragedy-all-157-beds-at-nashik-hospital-occupied/articleshow/82206944.cms||Santosh Sonawane

There were several reports on news portals and web media about a large number of SC judges having tested positive. The SC sources said of the two only Justice Khanna required brief hospitalisation. “Both judges are on their way to recovery,” the sources said. But, the pandemic appears to have afflicted many staff and senior officials impeding even the virtual hearings. On Wednesday and Thursday almost all judges underwent RT-PCR test and all tested negative. But, as the infection rate among the staff is high, the SC had decided to list eight cases for hearing on Thursday through video conferencing before three benches, as against an average of twelve benches that had operated since March 25 last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/only-2-sc-judges-have-tested-covid-positive-clarifies-court/articleshow/82206964.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Shah returns Mamata’s ‘outsider’ fire, promises connectivity for N Bengal||Harirampur (Malda): Union home minister Amit Shah took chief minister Mamata Banerjee head on over her “outsider” barb, saying infiltrators who happen to be the “CM’s vote bank” were rank outsiders. “Mamata Didi calls me and the PM outsiders. I was born in this country and will die here. How can I be an outsider? Instead, your infiltrator vote bank is packed with outsiders,” Shah said on Thursday. The BJP senior chose Harirampur, a hamlet at Gazole, 17km from Malda town, to deliver his election speech — for candidates in Malda and South Dinajpur — in front of a small gathering. “We are now doing small gatherings due to the Covid situation,” he said. Shah pegged his speech on the north Bengal development plank because many people in this belt had voted for BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. “Both Trinamool Congress and the preceding Communist government took a step-motherly attitude towards north Bengal when this region is quite crucial for national security,” he said. The Union minister focused on connectivity, including the 675km Kolkata-Siliguri expressway that would bring down travel time by a couple of hours. He also promised that a BJP government, once voted into office, would seek the Centre’s help to construct the Tentulia corridor connecting Tentulia in Bangladesh and Chopra, Jalpaiguri, Maynaguri that would cut the distance by 90km. Among the promises was Metro service in Siliguri. On infrastructure, Shah assured a mega logistics park at Farakka that would help fetch investments in north Bengal and an IT park in Siliguri. On health, the Union minister promised an AIIMS for north Bengal and new hospitals in each district so that north Bengal residents didn’t have to travel to Kolkata. He also promised a central university and safe drinking water supply to each household. Shah didn’t lose focus on women voters, a large section of whom had voted for Trinamool chief Banerjee in the preceding polls. He made a specific promise to women of 33% reservation for them in government jobs. The Union minister said a BJP government would make education free for girl students, from KG to PG level, and make public transport — train, bus, tram, Metro — free for women. To woo Bengal farmers, Shah iterated that his party’s government would clear the Rs 18,000 arrears under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi each farmer was entitled to for the last three years, but were denied the benefits by the TMC government. A BJP government would also support each farmer with Rs 10,000 a year, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/shah-returns-mamatas-outsider-fire-promises-connectivity-for-n-bengal/articleshow/82204848.cms||Subhro Maitra
---||Kolkata||Bengal: EC seeks report on two cases of ‘firing’ by police, central forces||BAGDAH/ASHOKENAGAR: The Election Commission has sought reports into two incidents of firing in North 24 Parganas during polls on Thursday: the first by the state police, in which two people were injured, and the other an allegation of firing by central forces. The former incident, at Bagdah, was confirmed by the cops themselves, whereas the district administration dismissed the latter, at Ashokenagar, as “a rumour”. According to a senior district police officer, a police patrol came under attack by a 150-strong mob, injuring three policemen, including the Bagdah OC, when they tried to break up a clash. In the latter incident, the poll panel has sought a report on how two people received bullet injuries even though the district administration has denied reports of firing. The Bagdah incident happened when the police responded to a clash at Ranoghat, near booths 35 and 36 at Ranoghat Primary School. “A 150-strong mob, armed with iron rods, bamboo sticks and sharp weapons, suddenly attacked the sector office at Ranoghat,” said a senior district police officer. “A police team, led by OC Utpal Saha, tried to disperse the mob when the mob started pelting stones at them, leaving three cops injured. They had to fire in the air to disperse the mob.” Two people — Dhruba Santra and Mrittunjoy Santra — were injured. A resident said there were a series of clashes between TMC and BJP supporters. “The cops fired in the air to disperse the mob. Later, a clash broke out between the cops and the mob, which was throwing bricks at the police team, injuring some cops. Then police then fired at the mob,” he added. Biswajit Das, the BJP candidate from Bagdah, claimed at least five persons were injured in the police firing. “All of them were admitted to Bongaon subdivisional hospital,” he said. Bengal chief electoral officer Aariz Aftab said the police were attacked while they were dispersing the mob. “The OC of Bagda was attacked, along with a constable, who sustained multiple injuries. The cops had to fire three rounds,” he said, adding there were about 250 people of a political party that had gathered at the spot. At Ashokenagar, trouble broke out around 11.30am over the ransack of a BJP camp office near Tangra Adarsha Sikkha Niketan, at booth 79. A clash then broke out between TMC and BJP supporters. Here, two people were injured, and allegations began to fly that it was CISF men that had opened fire, a charge vehemently denied by the district administration. “Both groups hurled bombs at each other near the booth,” said a resident, adding, “A police vehicle and a bus ferrying polling officers were also severely damaged during the clash. After being alerted, the central forces jawans rushed to the spot to disperse the mob, failing which they opened fire, in which two persons were injured .” The injured persons identified as Khabirul Hossain and Sheikh Sujauddin, both with bullet injuries in their legs. Ashokenagar TMC candidate Narayan Goswami claimed both the injured persons were his party supporters. “The central forces deliberately opened fire at our supporters, leaving injured two of them. They have been admitted to a nursing home in Barasat. I have lodged a complaint with the Election Commission against the firing,” Goswami said. Sumit Gupta, DM, North 24 Parganas, denied allegations of firing. “We have already looked into the matter and spoken to officials manning the booth. Nothing firing has happened. We suspect that it was just a rumour,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ec-seeks-report-on-two-cases-of-firing-by-police-central-forces/articleshow/82204788.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty
---||Kolkata||Samsergang, Jangipur bypoll deferred to May 16||KOLKATA: The Election Commission has rescheduled bypoll in Samsergang and Jangipur to May 16 from May 13 after several organisations requested that the date be deferred in the wake of Eid-ul-Fitr, which may have coincided with polling day. The bypoll to the two assembly seats was necessitated following the demise of Congress’ Samsergang candidate Rezaul Haque and RSP’s Jangipur candidate Pradip Kumar Nandi, both of whom died of Covid-19. The EC has fixed April 29 as the date of filing nominations for the bypoll. A majority of the population in these two constituencies are Muslims. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had urged the EC to review the date of bypoll while AIMIM and Bengal Imams Association too had made a similar request in writing. Dr Md Wasim Akhtar, a resident of Samsergang, said they welcomed the EC’s decision to defer the bypoll. “It is not that people would not have gone out to vote if the date had remained unchanged. But, had the date clashed with that of Eid, families would not have been able to go and vote together as is the practice here,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/samsergang-jangipur-bypoll-deferred-to-may-16/articleshow/82204466.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||‘Double-engine’ govt will ensure free vaccines: BJP||Kolkata: The Bengal BJP, confident of reaching the magic number after the sixth phase of polling on Thursday, promised that a “double-engine” government would arrange for free vaccines for people of the state. State BJP vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar made the announcement a day after chief minister Mamata Banerjee declared that her government would procure vaccines and administer them for free from May 5. “The CM is on her way out. Based on our organizational inputs, we have reasons to believe that we have reached our target. The outgoing CM won’t get a chance after May 2. The Centre and the new government in the state will work hand in hand to tackle the pandemic in Bengal,” Majumdar said. The BJP leader reminded how Union home minister Amit Shah “had come forward with the wherewithal” when the Covid situation spun out of control in Delhi during the first phase. “The Union home minister went out of his way to help the Delhi CM. A double-engine sarkar (government) won’t wait for the situation to aggravate. We will use all available resources to combat Covid in Bengal,” he added. BJP spokesperson Shamik Bhattacharya accused Trinamool of spreading “the Covid scare” to meet “political ends”. “The CM is blaming the PM and the Union home minister for coming to Bengal from outside and spreading the virus. The BJP has already cut down on rallies and gatherings. BJP seniors are conducting campaigns in a restricted manner. I would just present facts about the CM. Mamata Banerjee and (her nephew) Abhishek Banerjee held a total 14 rallies on April 21-22 amid the second wave,” he said. Admitting a recent shortage in supply of vaccines compared to the demand, Bhattacharya said: “What was the CM, who is also the health minister, doing when Bengal had a stock of 21 lakh vaccines with hardly any takers? She could have motivated people to take the jab by taking it herself.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/double-engine-govt-will-ensure-free-vaccines-bjp/articleshow/82204485.cms||---
---||Kolkata||What about 1 nation, 1 vaccine price?: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee||ASANSOL/SOUTH DINAJPUR: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, slamming the differential pricing for Covishield as “discriminatory and anti-people”, questioning why states would have to pay “167% more” for the same purpose, and expressing fears that this would trigger “unscrupulous mechanisms in the market”. Banerjee wrote that the price differentiation was “unheard of in Indian history”. “One nation, one party, one leader shouts BJP all the time but to save lives they can’t have one price for vaccine”, she tweeted. On Wednesday, Serum Institute of India (SII) — which manufactures Covishield — sought to fix Rs 400 per dose for all future orders, nearly 2.7 times the earlier-negotiated price of around Rs 150 for its current contract with the Centre. It also announced its decision to fix a price of Rs 400 per jab for state governments and Rs 600 for private hospitals. It was, however, silent on the proposed increase in price for central government supplies. A senior company executive said the 110 million doses to the Centre was expected to be at the “earlier negotiated price of around Rs 150 per jab”. The CM, in her letter, said: “In a grave crisis situation like the one the country is facing now, there is no place for making business by the vaccine manufacturers”, adding, “Every effort in this situation should be directed towards the common good of people without any difference or discrimination.” “It appears that there is a bias in favour of market against the interest of common people,” the CM wrote, adding, “States will buy vaccines for the poor and the young, hence your policy [of differential pricing] is both anti-poor and anti-youth.” The CM dubbed the Rs 600 rate for private hospitals as “not only discriminatory but also unhealthy, as it is likely to trigger unscrupulous mechanisms in the market.” “Every Indian”, she stressed, “should get free vaccines, regardless of age, caste, creed, location, at one price, irrespective of who pays — the Centre or the states.... Such peculiar differentiation of rates is also unheard of in Indian history. In fact, never ever has any state in this country been asked to buy vaccines in any mass immunisation drive, let alone at such hugely high rates!” At a public meeting in South Dinajpur, Banerjee also brought up the PM-Cares Fund, questioning why the Centre, which had “a lot of money” in it, had not decided to provide vaccines free of cost. “Why couldn’t they (central leaders) do the needful all these months?” The CM also repeated her charge that “this COVID-19 rage was Modi’s contribution” to the country. “So far, you (the PM) have done nothing; you did not alert people or take necessary precautions when there was time. Now, amid the rise in cases, you are asking people to buy doses and get vaccinated.” She also brought up the example of Israel, which recently curbed its outdoor mask rule. “In Israel, no one has to wear a mask because they have been vaccinated. But look at what is happening here. First the Centre makes no arrangement to provide vaccines. When we (the states) want to do it ourselves, we are being restricted,” she said, adding the state government had already vaccinated 93 lakh people. “As of now, we are inoculating 40,000-50,000 people every day. The state has sought one crore more shots. We are trying to vaccinate more people in high-prevalence zones, like Kolkata,” she told the crowd. The CM also questioned the Centre’s “attempt to put the onus” on people. “What had you done for the last five months, when cases were low? Why didn’t you provide vaccine to people? This is purely your contribution.... We want the vaccine to be immediately available and that, too, at a uniform price.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cm-what-about-1-nation-1-vaccine-price/articleshow/82204878.cms||Mohammad Asif
