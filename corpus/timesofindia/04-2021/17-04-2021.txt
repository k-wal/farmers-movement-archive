The B1617 variant was designated on Thursday a “variant under investigation” by Public Health England (PHE), meaning it has concerning epidemiological, immunological or pathogenic properties and requires investigation. PHE said that up to April 14 it had identified 77 cases of the “Indian variant” in Britain — 73 in England and four in Scotland. PHE said: “The variant, first detected in India, includes a number of mutations, including E484Q, L452R, and P681R. All appropriate public health interventions will be undertaken, including enhanced contact tracing. PHE and international partners continue to monitor the situation closely.” Read AlsoCovid variant first detected in India is found in the UKNEW DELHI: A highly infectious new double mutant Covid-19 variant that was first detected in India has now been found in the UK sparking calls for Boris Johnson to cancel his trip to India. The B1617 variant was on Thursday designated a 'variant under investigation' by Public Health England meaningL452R is responsible for several large outbreaks in California and E484Q is similar to a mutation seen in the South Africa and Brazil variants. Together, E484Q and L452R, found together for the first time in India, are known to be more infectious, more transmissible and to evade antibodies. It is likely the India variant is at least in part driving the current exponential rise in cases in India — with more than 200,000 cases recorded on Wednesday. The Kent (UK) variant (also known as B117) is currently the dominant variant in Britain and, alongside the South Africa and Brazil variants, it is designated a “variant of concern”. Professor Christina Pagel, director of the Operational Research Unit at UCL and a member of Independent Sage, tweeted: “B1617 is worrying because it has some potentially worrying mutations not seen in the SA, Kent or Brazil strains. This variant might escape both T-cell and antibody action. India going through a big surge — mix of B117 & new B1617. Johnson should not go on a trip to Delhi this month! Madness! You can’t transmit Covid by Zoom. The situation in India is very bad and worsening.” “With India’s Covid-19 cases at more than 200,000 a day, and worries about a new strain there, it is extraordinary it has not been put on the red list for travel. The conspiracy theory from senior Tories is that the PM wants to avoid it going on the red list because that could derail his forthcoming official visit there,” tweeted ITV News political editor Robert Peston. “And if the trip were canned, the EU’s trade talks with India would begin before Johnson’s.”   Downing Street sources told TOI that Boris Johnson’s trip to India would be going ahead in a pared-back fashion, with the bulk of the programme now taking place in Delhi on April 26. The issue of whether to add India to the red list and the trip were “under constant review” based on the latest scientific evidence. Pakistan and Bangladesh were added to the UK travel red list on April 9. People travelling from countries on the red list are banned from entering the UK unless they are British citizens or have residency rights, in which case they have to undergo mandatory quarantine and Covid testing at a government-approved hotel for 10 days at a cost of £1,750 (Rs 1.7 lakh) per adult.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/covid-variant-first-detected-in-india-is-found-in-the-uk/articleshow/82108280.cms||NAOMI CANTON

Nirav (50) is currently lodged at Wandsworth prison in London. India wants to extradite him to stand trial to face charges of defrauding PNB of Rs 6,498 crore, of laundering the proceeds and interfering with witnesses and evidence. District judge Sam Goozée had on February 25 sent Nirav’s case to Patel to make a decision on whether to order extradition, saying he was satisfied there was a “prima facie” case, meaning there is evidence upon which Nirav could be convicted at trial in India. He also said that his extradition would be compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights and it would not be oppressive to extradite him despite his deteriorating mental health. A UK home office spokesperson said: “The extradition order was signed on April 15.” Nirav has 14 days to apply for permission to appeal to the UK high court. He may seek leave to appeal against both the decisions of the district judge and of the home secretary. If permission is granted, the high court will go on to consider the appeal. If there is no application to appeal, he must be extradited within 28 days of the secretary of state’s decision to order extradition. Appeals to the Supreme Court can only be made if the high court has certified that the case involves a point of law of general public importance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-home-secretary-priti-patel-orders-extradition-of-nirav-modi-to-india/articleshow/82108358.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||World||Pakistan temporarily blocks social media platforms||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Friday temporarily blocked all major social media platforms in a bid to prevent protesters linked to a far-right group, the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), from coordinating mass demonstrations demanding the eviction of the French ambassador from the country. “Complete access to social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, and Telegram) may be blocked from 11am to 3pm on April 16 across the country,” read a notification issued by the interior (home) ministry to the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA). “It is requested that immediate action may be taken on the subject matter under intimation to this ministry,” it added. A day earlier, interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed had admitted that the government’s negotiations with TLP had suffered because the now-proscribed TLP would issue directions to its supporters for blockades in major cities via social media. “They were more prepared than us,” he said. The ministry had also, over the past week, blocked internet access on cell phones in areas under blockade in a bid to prevent the demonstrators from calling on more support. Internet service on several mobile phone services still remain blocked. Some rights activists criticized Friday’s social media blackout, warning it could lead to more severe curbs on freedoms. Meanwhile, the detained TLP chief Saad Rizvi, in a purported handwritten note, shared by the government, had urged his followers to maintain law and order and avoid blocking roads and highways. In the letter, Rizvi had asked TLP supporters to peacefully go back to their homes and cooperate with law enforcement agencies. Many of the TLP supporters, however, insisted they won’t stop unless the words come from Rizvi himself before stopping.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-temporarily-blocks-social-media-platforms/articleshow/82108423.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

As soon as Rakeshwar Singh Manhas arrived at Kangra Fort here on Friday, the jubilant villagers, his friends, and family members garlanded him, showered flower petals on him and distributed sweets while dancing to the tunes of drums. Thanking everyone concerned for their efforts in his safe return, the family members of the abducted CoBRA commando said their happiness knew no bounds on seeing him back with them. Manhas was released almost a week back by the Naxals after being abducted in Chhattisgarh. While talking to media persons, he said he was happy to be back home with his family and was grateful to all those who had extended support to them during trying times. “I didn’t lose hope for even a minute when I was their captive,” Manhas said, adding that he wasn’t tortured during his captivity. His wife Meenu thanked the mediators, the Centre, the J&K administration and the Chhattisgarh government, besides the security forces for their joint efforts in bringing her husband back. The family had earlier expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah on Manhas’ release. Earlier, people had blocked the Jammu-Akhnoor Road and appealed to the PM and Shah for CoBRA jawan’s safe release after a photograph of Manhas sitting in a hut while in Naxal captivity had surfaced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/released-from-naxal-captivity-cobra-commando-reunites-with-family-in-jammu/articleshow/82108447.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

She was booked under UAPA. Her house was also searched as a part of the operation on Wednesday in Karewa Mohalla of Frisal village in Kulgam district of south Kashmir following specific inputs on possible presence of terrorists in the area. Police on Friday said that it has disengaged a woman special operation officer from service and arrested her for glorifying militancy and obstructing government official from doing his duty. In a statement, the police said that during the course of the search, the search party was obstructed by the woman -- identified as Saima Akhter -- a resident of Frisal. She was later identified as a special police officer (SPO) working in the police department, the statement added. Saima, according to the police, resisted the search party and turned violent and uttered words that could have incited terrorists. She shot a video on her personal cellphone as well and posted it on social media platforms with the “aim of attracting violence.” A case under Sections 353 of IPC, 13 of UAPA has been registered at the Yaripora police station and an investigation has begun, the statement said. PDP president and former J&K chief minister Mehbooba Mufti termed the police action as “cruel”. “Saima Akhter from Kulgam has been slapped with UAPA for raising legitimate questions about searching her home repeatedly without any reason. Saima’s ailing mother understandably exacerbated her worries. When it comes to cruelty even women aren’t spared in Naya Kashmir,” Mehbooba tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jammu/woman-police-officer-held-in-jammu-and-kashmir-for-obstructing-search-operations/articleshow/82114985.cms||M Saleem Pandit

---||Delhi||How traffic cameras issue e-challans||Last year, the number of drivers who were informed about their traffic violations through e-challans was almost double than those caught on the road. Till a few years back, when drivers used to be stopped for violating traffic rules, they would give innumerable excuses, argue with traffic policemen and even escape without paying fine. Now due to e-challans, such arguments are almost absent, and violators are being caught on camera. We spoke with experts to understand how the cameras capture traffic violations and how the e-challan process work. What is e-challan? Manish Agarwal, Joint Commissioner of Police, Traffic, Delhi Police, explains, “E-challan is a contactless challan. There are cameras for red light jumping and cameras for over-speeding installed at multiple locations, and capture images of violations. Another kind of challan that we (Delhi Police) do is app-based. The app is downloaded on the traffic policeman’s phone and when he notices a violation he can click photos and upload it on the app and then the challan is issued. Both these challans are without any contact so obviously the interface between the violator and police is absent and it saves time. The number of challans has also gone up in Delhi because of this. Once a person receives a text on his/her registered number regarding the challan, they can go to the website and pay the fine. They can also contest it in court if they feel that a mistake has been made.” How cameras issue challansKapil Bardeja, CEO, co-founder, Vehant Technologies, a surveillance solutions company, says, “The cameras record traffic violations, and click photos every time a vehicle breaks rules and then it sends the data – vehicle number and type of violation – to the control centre. Along with the photo, these cameras also capture a short video as proof. Date, time and camera number is encrypted in the image itself so even authorities cannot tamper with it. The encrypted image goes from the local server to the central server (police control room). Then the data is sent VAHAN (the national vehicle registry database of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways). Then a message is sent to the phone number which is registered with the vehicle.” For parking violations, no-parking zones are fed into the system. A time limit is also set up and if a vehicle is in the zone beyond that time, then a violation is registered. Delaying fine payments is riskyManish Agarwal, Joint Commissioner of Police, Traffic, Delhi Police, says, “We are bringing several provisions for non-payment cases. We are in discussion with insurance companies where if a vehicle has a certain number of pending challans then that amount can be added to the insurance.” Pankaj Gupta, an advocate who takes up traffic violation cases, says, “We advise people to pay their fines as soon as they receive the notice. If you fail to pay it, then any transaction related to the vehicle is out of question. If it is a cab, then permits will not be renewed. However, licenses are rarely revoked.” To see all violations registered against a particular vehicle, go to echallan.parivahan.gov.in and enter the registered phone number||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-traffic-cameras-issue-e-challans/articleshow/82103731.cms||Niharika Lal
---||Goa||One match does not make me a good player: Glan Martins||Margao: How good is Glan Martins? Let’s hear from Henk ten Cate, formerly a member of the coaching staff at Barcelona, Chelsea and Ajax. Now, he’s coaching Al Wahda in the AFC Champions League. “Very good midfielder, (jersey) No 25. Good player. I saw him, I liked him a lot,” said ten Cate. The Al Wahda coach had stayed behind to watch FC Goa take on the might of Al Rayyan on Wednesday. The hosts managed a draw against the Qatar heavyweights, and from among the numbers that he had noted down – 8 (James Donachie), 4 (Ivan Gonzalez) and 23 (Edu Bedia) – 25 stood out. It was Martins, apart from goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh, who impressed him the most. It wasn’t just ten Cate. Anyone who watched Martins against Al Rayyan would have fallen in love with the midfielder. He was here, there, everywhere, making life difficult for the opponents. It was not the same at the start of the season. At ATK Mohun Bagan, Martins was rarely used by coach Antonio Habas, who prefers a different profile. Since making a move though to Goa in February, the Velsao-based player has rediscovered himself and become Juan Ferrando’s favourite in midfield. “At FC Goa, playing with the foreign players gives you a lot of motivation and confidence to just go out there and perform. Even if you make a mistake, they are there behind to protect. The coach has shown faith in me. He keeps telling us to help each other and not to worry if we make mistakes,” said Martins. If you excuse the penalty miss in the semifinal against Mumbai, Martins has hardly put a foot wrong since joining Goa. He’s tireless in midfield and has struck a good partnership with captain Edu Bedia. So, India next? “I am hoping,” Martins told TOI when asked if he expects a call from national coach Igor Stimac when he shortlists probables for the World Cup qualifiers in June. “The first target is to work harder. I have to keep working hard. One match does not make me a good player. I have to show it (regularly), maintain my good form for a longer time and I am hoping I’ll eventually get the call.” The call from Stimac, if he does enough, won’t come until the conclusion of the AFC Champions League group stage later this month. There are five games left to be played and Martins doesn’t want to take the foot off the pedal. “The Champions League is very competitive. Compared to ISL matches, the standard is very high. I think, as a team, we have adapted. We did well in the first game. We just have to remain focused. This level is different, so we have to keep going,” said Martins.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/one-match-does-not-make-me-a-good-player-glan-martins/articleshow/82108764.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Goa||Every game in AFC Champions League is a masterclass: Juan Ferrando||Margao: Juan Ferrando has warned his players that they will have “big problems” if they do not continue to work as a team and punch above their weight in the AFC Champions League. FC Goa stunned Al Rayyan SC with a fighting draw in their opening group game at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Wednesday. The goalless draw drew praise for the club and players, but the coach knows the job is far from done. "In these six games, if we are not focused in the same way, our image, the image of Indian football and Goa won't be good," the FC Goa coach told reporters during the pre-match media interaction on Friday. Goa are playing in the AFC Champions League for the first time but did well to measure up to the challenge against the Qatar heavyweights, coached by former PSG manager Laurent Blanc. Ferrando said his team would continue to face challenges throughout the competition. “We know the quality of our squad and we have to improve as a team,” said Ferrando. “I think it's a good opportunity for the players. When you play six games at this level, they understand about pressing, about positional attack, about timing of the attack, timing of the press, about control and transitions. “For us, it’s a masterclass every game. Now surely the local players they understand why the (AFC) Champions League is among the most important.” Ferrando knows his side does not have the experience of their opponents from Iran, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). “The solution is to play every season in the Champions League,” said Ferrando, providing examples how Al Rayyan turned defence into attack within a matter of seconds when Goa lost the ball. The young Spanish coach has now turned his attention to Al Wahda, coached by Henk ten Cate, formerly at Barcelona, Chelsea and Ajax. "I know the head coach of Al Wahda. He's a very intelligent coach. He was working in Barcelona with (Frank) Rijkaard. It will be a hard game. For me, it's very important that everybody pays attention to the game,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/every-game-in-afc-champions-league-is-a-masterclass-juan-ferrando/articleshow/82108803.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Goa||Al Wahda coach Henk ten Cate laments ‘crazy’ ACL schedule||Margao: Al Wahda did not have the best of starts to their group E campaign in the AFC Champions League. The UAE side lost the opener by a solitary goal against Persepolis FC at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Wednesday. “Despite the loss of the first game, I was not unhappy with the performance of the team,” said coach Henk ten Cate. “We played the best team in Asia and we had our chances to at least take a point out of this game. We deserved a point.” Al Wahda now face FC Goa in their next match on Saturday and the Dutch coach has little time on hand to prepare his team. “There is very short time and lot of matches to be played. To be honest, I don’t like the schedule. I don’t understand how they agreed to the schedule where we play six matches in two weeks. The weather circumstances are there, then its (month of) Ramadan. It’s crazy (schedule). Anyway, we are here and we have to make the best out of it,” ten Cate said during the pre-match media interaction on Friday. Al Wahda are from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and 90 percent of its players are Muslims who, during the holy month of Ramzan, refrain from all food and drink during daylight hours. That hasn’t made ten Cate’s job any easier. “For us it’s very difficult because the players have to refill their bodies. My players, majority of them, 90 percent, are Muslims. They are in Ramadan. It means they can start eating at 7pm until 3.30 or 4 in the morning. “From 4am till 7pm, which is the longest period, they are not allowed to eat and drink. For an athlete who has to perform, you have to refill yourself with proteins. It’s not easy (to perform when fasting),” said the Dutch coach. Interestingly, Al Wahda play just one game at 10.30pm while five of their games have been scheduled for an early 8pm kickoff. “If it’s the other way round, I would have accepted better than what I do now. I hope the AFC understands this. “The recovery period (here) is too short. Even in World Cups, when you talk of the highest level of players, you have more rest than what we have now. Not only for us, it goes for all the teams. The teams who don’t do Ramadan are at an advantage,” he said. Except for FC Goa, all other teams are from Islamic countries with players observing a fast during the holy month.

---||Goa||GFA wants abandoned match to resume with penalty kick, says referees were in ‘confused state of mind’||Panaji: The Goa Football Association has admitted that referees “in a confused state of mind” were wrong to overturn a decision that saw them first award a penalty retake and then turn it into an indirect free-kick for the defending team. In the 73rd minute of the Goa Professional League clash between Salgaocar FC and Calangute Association on Tuesday, there was huge drama at the Duler Football Stadium in Mapusa. Calangute were awarded a penalty by referee Mario Pereira after Melvin Lobo's goal-bound shot hit Salgaocar defender Linbert Rebello's hand inside the box. Kouame Junior stepped up to take the penalty kick and calmly dispatched the ball into the nets. The referee, however, overruled the goal and called for a retake as one Calangute player had his foot inside the box when the penalty was taken. As Salgaocar players objected, the referee then consulted with the assistant referee and changed his earlier decision of a retake. Instead, a free-kick was awarded for Salgaocar. The GFA has now reviewed that decision. “It was observed that admittedly there were lapses on the part of the referees who were in a confused state of mind. The referee also conveyed his final decision that it is a retake of the penalty due to encroachment on the part of a Calangute player,” GFA president Churchill Alemao wrote in a letter to Salgaocar, copies of which were marked to all executive committee members on Friday. “Given the circumstances and in the best interest of the game”, Alemao requested “both teams to kindly cooperate in sporting spirit to complete the remainder of the match from the 73rd minute of the match on April 19 at Duler stadium, 4.15pm.” Calangute should be happy to continue from where the controversy erupted, particularly with the advantage of a penalty in hand and 17 minutes left to be played in this goalless encounter. However, Salgaocar are yet to take a decision. The club had maintained they should be awarded full points since it were their opponents who refused to continue with the match, paving the way for an abandonment. “Salgaocar received the letter on Friday, after office hours. Since Saturday and Sunday are non-working days, the club can file a detailed reply only on Monday. It’s unlikely that the match will happen, as GFA wants, on Monday at 4.15pm,” said a source. The referee decision raised several eyebrows, particularly with match-fixing allegations tarnishing the league for the last two seasons. “With @GoaFAOfficial league embroiled in charges of match fixing, what happened today at the match between #Calangute assoc & #Salgaoncar FC makes matter even worse. This is not Football,” former GFA president Elvis Gomes said in a tweet, tagging Fifa, AFC and AIFF. According to IFAB Laws of the Game 2020-21, Law 14: ‘The Penalty Kick’, “if the player taking the penalty kick or a team-mate infringes the Laws of the Game: if the ball enters the goal, the kick is retaken; if the ball does not enter the goal, the referee stops play and restarts with an indirect free kick.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfa-wants-abandoned-match-to-resume-with-penalty-kick-says-referees-were-in-confused-state-of-mind/articleshow/82108889.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Goa||ACL: FC Goa hungry for more after draw in opener||Margao: To many it may not make sense why FC Goa’s goalless draw against Al Rayyan SC on their AFC Champions League debut is being widely celebrated. This is, after all, only a draw; a game where India’s most-attacking football team had just one shot on target. This was also the opening game in group E and there are five more yet to be played at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda. But what Goa achieved on Wednesday night was best exemplified by rival coaches. “I have to be honest, I was surprised with the level,” Al Wahda FC coach Henk ten Cate told TOI on Friday. “I know Al Rayyan, they are a very strong team. But FC Goa quality surprised me. It’s a good team, really well organised where the (jersey) No. 23 (Edu Bedia) plays a key role.” This comes from ten Cate, a coach who can identify himself with very good teams. He was coaching at Barcelona when they won the UEFA Champions League in 2006 and won trophies with Ajax too. FC Goa Juan Ferrando felt the Dutch coach was being polite, rather politically correct, as the teams now face each other in the second match at the same venue on Saturday. But as the young coach finished his pre-match press conference and was on his way out, there was more appreciation. This time, Laurent Blanc, who coaches Al Rayyan, stopped to say hello and spent some time talking about what the team did on Wednesday. “Sorry for the delay. I had to speak with the Goa coach,” the former France defender and member of the 1998 World Cup winning squad later told reporters. This is what a draw has done to Goa and their image on debut in Asian football’s top-tier club competition. “The score in the last game was good because we played against a very good team, but we want to improve,” said Ferrando. “Our target is to continue in the same way. It’s necessary to control some details in attack since we didn’t have success (in front of goal).” Ferrando is unlikely to tamper with the team that secured a famous draw against Al Rayyan. From Dheeraj Singh in goal to Ishan Pandita upfront, almost everyone played their roles to perfection. But with Al Wahda coach taking notes and now knowing exactly what to expect from the hosts, life won’t be easy. “I know the Al Wahda coach’s style, their attacking methodology. It’s very important to change some details because we knew Al Rayyan and prepared accordingly. Now we need a new plan,” said Ferrando. Al Wahda narrowly lost their opener against Persepolis but had done enough against last year’s finalists to at least walk away with a point. The UAE side – eighth in the league -- have quality in abundance. Up front, there is Slovenian World Cupper Tim Matavz. Syrian striker Omar Kharbin, a former Asian player of the year, is also on hand, while the experienced Ismail Matar –former UAE captain – is likely to start his first game after a spell on the sidelines. Goa have to start all over again. There is another Goliath waiting for the Davids of this group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/acl-fc-goa-hungry-for-more-after-draw-in-opener/articleshow/82108955.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||India||Afghanistan's future shouldn’t be a return to past: S Jaishankar||NEW DELHI: “We have always believed that this should be an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled process,” foreign minister S Jaishankar said on Friday in the backdrop of US President Joe Biden setting September 11 as the deadline for pulling out his troops from the war-ravaged country. “The future of Afghanistan should not be a return to its past. The international community should take care not to throw the baby out with the bathwater,” he warned while addressing a panel on the future of Afghanistan at the Raisina Dialogue, which was attended by Afghan NSA Hamdullah Mohib and Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif. Skirting a question about India’s possible outreach to the Taliban which now has a realistic chance of taking over Afghanistan, Jaishankar said, “The situation is evolving and everybody wants to make the best contribution that they can and shape the outcomes in Afghanistan as positively as they can. So, anybody responsible would consider all the aspects of that.” Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif was more forthcoming. Acknowledging Iranian contacts with the Taliban, he said the outfit should be a part of the peace process in Afghanistan, but it should not “control” the process. Taliban, he said, should abandon violence and work in the peace process within the Afghan constitution. Greeting the announcement of US withdrawal from Afghanistan as a positive development, Zarif said this provided an opportunity for the Taliban to respect Afghan public opinion. Jaishankar said, “In the last 20 years, we have demonstrated through our actions and projects on the ground what our real feelings are for Afghanistan. Afghanistan needs double peace. It needs peace within, and it needs peace around it.” On India engaging Pakistan, the minister said, “In the last 20 years, what is it we have done in Afghanistan? I watched a programme where former US NSA General McMaster said there is a fear on the Pakistani side of encirclement (by India). So, what do I plead guilty to: creating a dam near Herat, a parliament in Kabul, health facilities, radio stations and road networks? So, this is an absolute fantasy that our very presence and actions there are aimed at Pakistan. It ignores what we feel for the Afghan people, which is deeply rooted in our history and culture. Our agenda has been a positive agenda, please look at the agenda of other countries in the region, I wish I could say the same.” The will of the Afghan people, he said, should be expressed by democratic means. The challenge, he added, was how to get everybody to work together. While Jaishankar did not directly address the security implications of the US withdrawal, the MEA later issued a statement and said, “Any political settlement must be inclusive and should preserve the socio-economic and political gains of the past 19 years. India supports a united, democratic and sovereign Afghanistan. We are deeply concerned about the increase in violence and targeted killings in Afghanistan. India has called for an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire.” Afghan NSA Hamdullah Mohib said at the Raisina Dialogue panel that the Taliban missed yet another opportunity to show itself as a responsible stakeholder in the future of Afghanistan. “We found there is no change in the Taliban. It continues to destroy and kill. We lose about $900 million of infrastructure to Taliban attacks every year,” he said, adding that Afghanistan was in “uncharted waters”. “The devil is in the detail as we negotiate with the NATO and US.” In the next few days, a team would be set up to work out the details of the transition, Mohib said. There was consensus in the region, he added, that there should be a united, democratic and sovereign Afghanistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/afghanistans-future-shouldnt-be-a-return-to-past-s-jaishankar/articleshow/82109222.cms||---
---||India||Coronavirus: India’s worst-hit city by share of population is Nashik||NEW DELHI: The four cities with the highest number of fresh cases per million population over the last month are all in Maharashtra. Nashik at the top is followed by Nagpur, Pune and Mumbai, in that order. Sandwiched between these cities and Delhi (at No. 9) are Lucknow, Bangalore, Bhopal and Indore, with Patna rounding off the top 10. In absolute numbers, Mumbai has added 3.7 lakh cases between March 16 and April 15, much higher than any other city, while Delhi seems like it is the next worst hit. Absolute numbers, however, can give a misleading picture as cities with much bigger populations would tend to have more cases. Calculating the number of cases per million makes it possible to compare cities with vastly different population sizes. Read our coronavirus live blog for all the latest news and updatesThus, Mumbai and Delhi with populations of over 20 million each have had single-day highs over the last month of over 19,400 and 14,300, respectively. But again, when we look at these numbers in proportion to their population, Lucknow’s high of just under 4,500 on April 15 is actually more alarming (see graphic). Read AlsoRT-PCR catching all Covid variants: GovernmentNEW DELHI: Amid concerns that RT-PCR may be failing to detect SARS-CoV-2 variants, the Centre on Friday said the test "does not miss" the variants found in the country so far. The Covid-19 virus has been mutating and various mutations have been found in many countries, as well as in India. TheseTOI looked at the number of Covid infections over the last one month in the country’s 30 most populous urban agglomerations – contiguous urban areas like Greater Mumbai or Greater Kolkata – according to the UN’s World Urbanisation Prospects data. For two of these, Hyderabad and Vijaywada, data wasn’t available. Almost all the cities have breached their previous highest daily cases during the course of this month and are continuing to witness a rise in daily cases. This is a serious worry for the health infrastructure in these cities, as there is no telling how far the cases would increase before they reach the peak. Mercifully, Mumbai, Pune, and Nashik are now seeing decreasing number of cases over the last few days indicating that these cities could be over their peak.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); In the cities in Kerala that form part of this list, as well as in Coimbatore and Visakhapatnam, the all-time high for daily cases was not during this past month. However, daily cases are rising steadily in these cities and the worry is that they could see even higher number of cases in the current surge than the last peak. The analysis here pertains to urban agglomerations, which means Mumbai includes Thane and Navi Mumbai and Chennai would include Thiruvallur, for instance. The only exception to this is Delhi, whose satellite cities are in other states and have not been included as part of the population or cases in Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/coronavirus-indias-worst-hit-city-by-share-of-population-is-nashik/articleshow/82109291.cms||Atul Thakur
---||India||Kumbh Mela duration: Sects spar, government stays out of it||NEW DELHI: The decision of two akhadas to exit the Maha Kumbh Mela in Haridwar has divided the Shaivite and Vaishnavite sects of akhadas in the country. This came even as the Uttarakhand government refused to wade into the matter and announce if the duration of the festival, which officially ends on April 30, should be cut short. On Thursday, two Sanyasi or Shaivite sects, Niranjani and Anand, had announced they were withdrawing. But the three Bairagi (or Vaishnavite) sects — Digambar, Nirvani and Nirmohi — said they had “no right” to do so. The Sanyasi seers consider the third Shahi Snan, which was on April 14, the high point of the congregation, while to the Bairagi seers, Ram Navami (on April 21) and the fourth Shahi Snan (on April 27) are most important. The apex body, Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad, tried to resolve the impasse but could not arrive at a decision. “There is no proposal from the state government (to curtail or call off the Mela), nor has any official request been received from the akhadas to truncate Kumbh,” chief secretary Om Prakash told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kumbh-duration-sects-spar-government-stays-out-of-it/articleshow/82109518.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Business||Now, even defaulters can borrow more||MUMBAI: In a move that will enable even delinquent borrowers to avail of additional bank loans, the government on Friday extended the scope of its Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme to those with repayment overdues of up to 60 days. The department of financial services said the facility would be available to 26 stressed sectors identified by a committee headed by former ICICI Bank chief K V Kamath. The list includes everything from healthcare, aviation and corporate retail outlets to power, cement, construction and textiles. So borrowers from these sectors with outstanding loans of Rs 50-500 crore can avail of the special facility. The amendment to the Rs 3 lakh crore ECLGS was announced as more cities went under a fresh lockdown following a fresh wave of Covid-19 cases. Around 80% of the scheme is understood to have been utilized which leaves around Rs 60,000 crore worth of loans available under the scheme that was originally meant for micro, small and medium enterprises that were facing a liquidity crunch. With MSME units not using up the entire limit, the government first extended it to professionals before opening it to the hospitality, travel and tourism sectors, which have been hit hard by Covid-19. Now, the scheme will be available to borrower accounts classified as Special Mention Account (SMA)-0 or SMA-1 as of February 29, 2020. These accounts are those where the overdue period is between 31 to 60 days. Initially, this facility was available to only those who were up to date with their payments. The fresh funding, backed by a government guarantee, can help these borrowers tap loans from banks, and even clear their past dues, enabling businesses to come back on track as the demand situation normalises. The government has said that the scheme would be available to loans sanctioned under the guaranteed emergency credit line during the period from May 23, 2020, to June 30, 2021, or till guarantees for an amount of Rs. 3 lakh crore are issued, whichever is earlier. While some analysts have expressed fears that guaranteeing loans to stressed borrowers would only hide the stress, credit rating agencies say that this is not a credit negative for lenders. “This cannot be termed as evergreening for several reasons. First, the earlier limits of 20% will not be enough to cover the loan repayment for the stress which may continue for a longer period. Second, since the loans are guaranteed by the government the banks are not increasing their credit exposure to the borrower. Third, most of the loans under the scheme have gone to borrowers with standard accounts and since the scheme has further headroom for new sanctions, that is being made available to borrowers in need,” said Anil Gupta, vice president, financial sector ratings ICRA. According to Gupta, this is a pragmatic decision from the macroeconomic standpoint as it will help businesses and save jobs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/now-even-defaulters-can-borrow-more/articleshow/82109619.cms||---

Fresh cases surged to another new peak at nearly 2.34 lakh. Meanwhile, one out of every four Covid-19 cases detected across the world on Thursday was in India, as surging numbers in the country were driving the global daily counts towards an all-time high. There were 845,408 fresh cases recorded across the world on Thursday, just 16 short of the peak of 845,424 reported on January 8, as per worldometers.info. Of these, India accounted for 216,902 cases, around 26% of the total. Brazil, with the world’s second-highest tally of daily cases on Thursday, was not even close to half of India's count at 80,529. On Friday, India recorded 2,33,987 new cases, an increase of 8% over the previous day's tally of 2,16,902. As many as 16 states posted their highest-ever surge in cases, a record for a single day. Fatalities provided a grim picture with daily deaths climbing to a record 1,340, going past the previous highest toll of 1,275 reported on September 15 last year, at the peak of the first wave in the country. Like the previous day, deaths in four states crossed the 100 mark, with Gujarat's toll coming close to three figures at 94. Maharashtra reported 398 deaths in the last 24 hours, the highest since October 2 last year when 424 fatalities were recorded. Chhattisgarh continued to report the second highest daily toll at 138, followed by Delhi (141) and Uttar Pradesh (103). Fatalities were also rising in Karnataka, which reported 78 deaths, followed by Madhya Pradesh at 60. Jharkhand reported 56 deaths, its highest toll from the pandemic in a single day. Maharashtra was also at the top among the 16 states that recorded their highest daily cases on Friday. It logged 63,729 new infections, going past the previous high of 63,294 recorded on Sunday. Uttar Pradesh continued to report a massive surge in numbers as a record 27,426 cases were detected in the state in the last 24 hours. Daily cases have tripled in UP in the last eight days since 8,490 infections were reported on April 8. Delhi's numbers climbed to nearly 20,000 at 19,486. Other states and UTs to report their highest single-day counts were Karnataka (14,859 new cases), Madhya Pradesh (11,045), Gujarat (8,920), Tamil Nadu (8,449), Rajasthan (7,359), Bengal (6,910), Haryana (6,277), Bihar (6,253), Jharkhand (3,843), Telangana (3,840), Uttarakhand (2,402), Goa (927) and Chandigarh (481).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/at-1340-india-records-highest-covid-deaths-in-a-day/articleshow/82109849.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

The building, around 45 feet high, is on the north side and adjacent to the new Centenary building of the high court. A constitution bench of Justices Ashwani Kumar Singh, Vikash Jain, Ahsanuddin Amanullah, Rajendra Kumar Mishra and Chakradhari Sharan Singh had taken suo motu judicial notice of the construction while holding the first hearing from the newly constructed Centenary building on another matter on March 1. It observed that the building came up during the Covid-19 pandemic. On Friday, the matter was adjourned after all the counsels unanimously prayed for it. May 3 has been fixed for hearing the matter again. On March 15, the state government had submitted that the building was being constructed by the minority welfare department through Bihar State Building Construction Corporation on a property of Bihar State Sunni Waqf Board for use as musafirkhana and other purposes. It had also submitted that the building plan was prepared and approved by the government architect and no permission was required for its construction from Patna Municipal Corporation under Bihar Building Bylaws, 2014. However, the constitution bench had observed that the construction was a clear breach of the bylaw number 21 which states that no building exceeding 10 metres height shall be permitted within 200 metres radius from the boundary of the governor’s house, Bihar state secretariat, legislative assembly, high court and such other buildings as may be decided by the authority or the state government from time to time. “Accordingly, we hereby direct that till further orders, no construction or related activity whatsoever shall be undertaken or continued by any person or authority in relation to the subject structure or any other structure exceeding 10 metres in height within a radius of 200 metres from the boundary wall of the high court without prior leave of this court,” the bench had ordered. It had also observed that the existence of the structure in such close proximity to the high court building, apart from causing incessant disturbance in court proceedings, prima facie poses serious security concerns for the judges, lawyers, litigants, staff and security personnel alike.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-impleads-state-waqf-board-in-4-storey-building-construction-case/articleshow/82107051.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Siswan SHO Kumar Vaibhav on Friday said the arrested are Rahul Singh, Abhishek Singh and Bhanu Pratap Singh. “A country made pistol and four live cartridges were also recovered from Abhishek’s possession after they all were nabbed by the MP’s bodyguards,” he said. Vaibhav said police have not been able to find any criminal antecedents of the trio. “They all are being interrogated thoroughly,” he said, adding, the MP’s husband has lodged an FIR. The MP’s husband told TOI over the phone, “All three were on a bike. They had kept the bike engine running while one of the youths walked towards us,” he said, adding, it was Rahul who attempted to strike a conversation. Singh said I asked him to come next morning when one of them standing near the bike pulled out a firearm. “My wife’s bodyguards Ranjeet Singh, Akhilesh Singh and Sanjay Sinha ran towards the youths and overpowered them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-mp-bodyguards-nab-three-with-arms-ammunitions/articleshow/82107062.cms||---

Log on to ‘findplasmadonor.com’ and you may find a plasma donor within days. A chartered accountant from the city has launched the website to help save lives in Gujarat in the times of Covid pandemic. “The demand for plasma has gone up sharply over last few days and sometimes it takes days to find a plasma donor wasting precious treatment time of the patient,” said Vaibhav Thakkar who has launched the website. He said not many are donating blood causing shortage while many a time blood banks ask to arrange for a plasma donor when a needy approaches it for plasma.“Our site is a platform where those in need of plasma can find the donors. All that the needy persons and the donors need to do is register themselves on the site. We check the authenticity of the person seeking plasma and then share the contact number of the donor with him or her,” 27-year-old Thakkar told TOI and added that it is a not-for-profit initiative. Over 100 donors have already registered on the site that was launched on April 1 apart from 200 patients in the need of plasma. “Apart from Vadodara, we are getting calls from Ahmedabad and Surat. Anyone who has been infected with Covid in the last one year can get registered on our site as a donor. There are many criteria to become eligible as a plasma donor. Our team will contact the donors and check the eligibility too,” Thakkar said.When asked what inspired him to start the website, Thakkar said, “On March 22 my father was tested positive for Covid and in the next two days I and my mother too got infected. Docs said that they needed plasma to treat my father and asked me to arrange for it. That was when I realised how tough it was to find a plasma donor.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cas-plasma-website-with-over-100-donors-saves-covid-patients/articleshow/82108185.cms||Tushar Tere

The depot falls under the Shyampukur constituency that will go to polls on April 29. “Messages on the requisition notice started circulating around when we were neck-deep in work, fixing the logistics and distribution of the freshly arrived lot of vaccines,” said a source. The state will write to the EC to exempt the store from the polling process this year due to the emergency nature of their work. “We hope the requisition was done according to previous elections without realising the gravity of activities at the depot this time around. We will be communicating with the requisition officer,” said state family welfare officer Ashim Das Malakar. During every election, a room at the vaccine store is requisitioned as a polling booth. The depot has not only been responsible for distribution of vaccine but also is the storehouse for PPE kits. The room requisitioned is at the entrance of the second gate. But it is just 120 feet from the vaccine store. “Since the store is within 200 metres of the proposed booth, we are a bit worried as stopping even a day’s operation will hamper the vaccination process,” said another staffer. According to EC norms, 200 metres hemming every polling booth is a sanitised zone with Section 144 orders in place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/polling-booth-requisition-notice-for-vax-depot-room/articleshow/82107939.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Police have sent the body for postmortem and registered a case against four. However, no one has been arrested in this connection so far. Accorting to reports, Rajvanshi Yadav (55), son of late Ramavtar was a supporter of village head candidate Vinod aka Malik Singh, son of Ramchandra Singh. On Thursday late evening, he had an argument with the other village head candidate Raju Sahini. The situation was calmed down and both returned to their homes after intervention of other villagers. On Thursday late night, Raju Sahini, along with his supporters, started hurling unparliamentary words in front of Rajvanshi’s house. Rajvanshi came out of his house and also informed the village head candidate Vinod aka Malik Singh. Later, Raju Sahini’s supporters started beating Rajvanshi. When his son Rudal (30) and Vinod aka Malik Singh intervened, they started beating them also. On being informed, the police reached the spot and rushed the injured to hospital from where Ranvanshi was referred to the district hospital. But he succumbed to his injuries on the way. On the written complaint of Vinod aka Malik Singh, Madanpur police have registered a case of unintentional murder against four including Raju Sahini, Anil and Bhola. “A group thrashed a person to death in Madanpur area over panchayat election rivalry. Three persons were injured. On the written complaint of a village head candidate a case of unintentional murder has been lodged against four accused. Police have initiated probe and are interrogating the accused,” said Ambika Prasad, CO Rudrapur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/supporter-of-pradhan-candidate-beaten-to-death-in-deoria/articleshow/82107144.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: ‘Drove 9km in five minutes to save four lives’||AHMEDABAD: Dr Rohit Joshi, a director of Aarna Hospital, was recently in a race against time to save patients on oxygen. “I got a call from my Paldi hospital that the oxygen would last just for five minutes – the alarm had already got buzzed. I had no other option. I took my car, a staffer and got two cylinders of oxygen in the car to cover the distance of 9km in five minutes. I broke almost all the rules of traffic that day. We only heaved a sigh of relief when we reached the spot in five minutes and 30 seconds,” recounts Dr Joshi. He confesses that any small accident could have killed him, as oxygen is highly inflammable.“But if I could not reach in time, four patients would be gasping for breath like fish out of water,” says Dr Joshi, a urologist. “The oxygen shortage is acute, and like me many other hospitals have completely stopped planned surgeries that requires oxygen. I have hired two mini trucks and four persons whose only work is to ferry oxygen from the production units to hospitals day-in, day out.” Dr Joshi is not alone in the quest for a few more breaths – several city-based hospitals are grappling with the issue of uninterrupted oxygen supply. Sources close to the development said that production is ramped up to meet the ever-rising demand, but the issue is of ensuring supply. Director of a city-based hospital said on condition of anonymity that the agencies are tired of the drudgery. “A delay of 15 minutes could be pardonable in general sense, but not when you are waiting for oxygen to arrive. Now the hospitals are asking for precise time, as they often have only that much gas left to offer the patients. Recently, news of a truck carrying the cylinder developing a flat tyre sent four hospitals in frenzy that sent cars and technicians to resolve the issue,” said the doctor. Dr Ishan Shah, director of Sushrusha Hospital, said that they cannot trust the suppliers, and thus have their own delivery system that can work in sync with the stock available. “Many hospitals have devised such system of hiring the vehicles and personnel that continuously replenish the stock,” he said. To put the issue in perspective, out of 5,212 Covid-19 patients admitted in city hospitals, 63% or 3,298 required oxygen. The ever-rising number of patients has made it difficult for the hospitals to sustain the stock. ‘High viral load has resulted in patients requiring more oxygen’ “During the current surge, patients are reporting higher viral load, affecting lungs of both young and old. Thus, the majority of the patients require oxygen as a treatment protocol. On an average, a patient on oxygen requires 1 to 4 litres per minute, which goes as high as 10 litres per minute for the patients in ICU,” said Dr Manoj Singh, a city-based pulmonologist. Dr J P Modi, medical superintendent of Civil Hospital, said that the patients in want of oxygen have increased manifold in the past fortnight. “We have 55 tonnes of liquid oxygen tanks that need refills once every 2-3 days. But now it’s getting refilled 2-3 times a day,” he said. Several city-based hospitals were forced to deny patients as they did not have adequate oxygen supply. EMRI 108 sources said that several such patients ended up at Civil Hospital in the city due to want of a bed with oxygen. The state government had recently told the Gujarat high court that from 50 tonnes a day, the requirement has shot up to 710 tonnes, forcing the manufacturers on a 24-hour production cycle to meet demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/drove-9km-in-5-minutes-to-save-4-lives/articleshow/82108653.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Patna||Bihar: ‘People can take vaccine during Navaratra, Ramzan fast’||PATNA: Taking Covid-19 vaccine during Navaratra and Ramzan will not break the fast, felt most of the 300 religious, spiritual and community leaders from across Bihar at an online workshop organized by Bihar Interfaith Forum for Children, UNICEF and WHO on Thursday. The experts at the workshop also observed that one infected person, who does not follow proper Covid bhaviour, can potentially infect up to 400 people in 30 days in the ongoing second wave of the pandemic. Dr Sala Siddhartha Sankar Reddy, health officer, UNICEF (Bihar), in a detailed presentation said: “As per the recent studies, one infected person who does not follow precautions like wearing a mask or social distancing can potentially infect up to 400 people in 30 days. If one takes all precautions, the exposure rate is reduced to 75% and the potential of infecting others to only 2.5 people in 30 days.” Regional team leader of WHO, Bihar, Dr Subramanya cleared doubts about vaccination and adverse events following vaccination (AEFI). Urging people to take utmost precautions during festivals and vaccine during religious fast, Dr Subramanya said, “The vaccine can be taken during Ramzan, Navaratra or any religious fast because it is an intramuscular dose and does not break the fast. However, it is better to eat something as people tend to feel anxious, queasy in an empty stomach. So, it would be beneficial to synchronise your time and eat something (iftar) or falahar.” Prof Syed Shah Shamimuddin Ahmed Munemi of Khanquah Munemia echoed similar views and said, “Government must ensure easy vaccination process at centres. This will gain the trust of general public.” Moulana Md Anisur Rahman Quasmi of the All India Milli Council said, “The government should conduct pre-vaccination check-up of people with comorbidities. This will help in reducing any side-effect and building trust for the vaccine." The International Islamic Fiqh Academy (IIFA) has also allowed vaccination during Ramzan. Father Joseph George, director of Bhagalpur Social Service Society, said, “Information about the vaccine is not reaching the small churches and marginalized groups.” Dr Ashok Kumar of Gayatri Pariwar urged people not to move out if not necessary. “We must create a positive atmosphere at home and have trust in God in hard times,” he added. B K Jyoti of Prajapita Brahma Kumari Ishwariya Vishwavidyalaya in Patna said, “I have been vaccinated without any side-effects.” Moderating the programme, UNICEF Bihar communication specialist Nipurnh Gupta said: “There is an infodemic in the pandemic. We need to share the correct information from trusted and verified sources. Faith leaders can hire young tech-savvy cadre to check and verify the accuracy of the messages. They have immense influence on the public and thus have a lot of responsibilities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/people-can-take-vaccine-during-navaratra-ramzan-fast/articleshow/82107826.cms||---

The liquid oxygen consignment would be provided to the three private gas plants in Patna to refill cylinders for hospitals. Currently, Patna needs at least four tankers of liquid oxygen daily to meet the demand for medical oxygen. The Bihar Industrial Area Development Authority (BIADA) chief administrative officer Santosh Kumar Sinha told TOI over the phone on Friday that two more tankers carrying liquid oxygen are expected to reach Patna by late evening on Friday. “Those two tankers are coming from Bokaro,” he said. When asked about the makeshift arrangement of using liquid nitrogen tankers of Bihar state milk cooperative federation limited for transporting liquid oxygen from manufacturing plants, Sinha said the Patna district administration has till now informed about two such tankers for use. “However, paperwork is to be completed as they are newly purchased. Registration numbers were allotted hardly two days back,” he said. Sinha said PESO (Petroleum and Explosive Safety Organization) certification for these tankers is pending. “That may get cleared within a day after which they could be used to transport liquid oxygen,” he added. Sinha further said the district administration has not provided any information if old nitrogen tankers are available with the federation and why they are not being roped in without delaying in the present situation. TOI tried contacting Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal and DM Chandrashekhar Singh for an update but both disconnected the call. It was the DM's proposal at the high-level virtual meeting on Thursday to use nitrogen carrying tankers for ferrying liquid oxygen to Patna from other states. Patna district industry centre general manager Amarnath Dubey told this newspaper on Friday that they have started monitoring the three oxygen refilling plants from Thursday night. “The oxygen plant at Fatuha has a normal capacity of refilling around 1,200 cylinders per day, the one at Sipara has a capacity of 800 cylinders while the one at Deedarganj can refill around 1,100 cylinders per day,” Dubey said. He said with the availability of liquid oxygen, the Fatuha plant’s daily capacity will go up by 700 cylinders, the Sipara plant by 1,500 and the third plant by 2,000 cylinders. However, as per the district administration’s assessment, hospitals in Patna require around 10,000 oxygen cylinders per day. This figure was shared by the DM during Thursday's meeting. Meanwhile, Patna deputy development commissioner (DDC) Richie Pandey told this newspaper that the order of diverting 90% of oxygen gas prepared by these plants to hospitals, by massively curtailing supply to industries, has been brought into effect.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/first-tanker-with-15k-litres-of-liquid-oxygen-reaches-patna/articleshow/82107796.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Many govt offices restrict entry of outsiders||AMARAVATI: Several government offices have started to enforce restrictions on the entry of visitors amid the sharp rise in Covid-19 cases in the state. Visitors, including those who come to have their grievances heard, are being allowed only with the prior permission of senior officials. The health department carried out RT-PCR tests on about 200 employees at the secretariat in Velagapudi on Friday. The department has decided to conduct Covid-19 screening on employees every Friday as part of measures to contain the virus. Senior officials in the secretariat are reported to have directed the security chief that the general public should submit their representations at the entry point. The Andhra Pradesh Special Police (APSP) that guards the secretariat has been directed not to allow any visitors, including contractors, to meet senior officials or ministers. Officials of Central Power Distribution Company Limited (CPDCL) have directed its field offices to prevent the entry of visitors. “No one except employees will be allowed to enter our office,” confirmed superintending engineer (SE), CPDCL, A Murali Mohan. Arrangements have been made to collect bill payments at counters outside the circle office. Letters and documents sent from other offices will be sent to concerned sections only after sanitisation at the entry point. “We have requested all field offices and other departments to route requests and other relevant documents through e-office/email/fax, SAP mail mode instead of sending hard copies,” Murali Mohan told TOI. In fact, staff in all electricity offices have been instructed to follow Covid-19 precautions while entering the office premises.

Unlike other multinational entities, banks are not able to sweep the market as authorities in India and elsewhere grant branch licences very judiciously. Yet, over half a dozen multinational banks have pumped in billions of dollars to grow their retail business across India, only to sell them and exit in the last two decades (see graphic). It started with ANZ Grindlays, then the largest foreign bank in India. ANZ Grindlays, which was to banking what Hindustan Lever was to FMCG, sold its business to StanChart and exited the country in 2000. A few years later in 2007, ABN Amro, which had acquired Bank of America’s retail business in 1998, sold out to RBS following a global deal. In the last decade, Deutsche Bank, ING, RBS and HSBC sold significant portions of their retail businesses in the country. While ANZ Grindlays did take a major hit because of the securities scam, most of the others had a profitable business. So, what is it that makes foreign banks exit after investing? According to veteran banker-turned-entrepreneur Gunit Chaddha, who started in Citibank, it is to do with the nature of the business. Chadha has had a ringside view of multinational banks in global markets as former CEO of Deutsche Bank Asia. “In my view, unlike investment banking or capital markets which are truly global businesses, retail banking is a home market or, at best, a multi-country business. The exception being credit cards and wealth management, both of which can be global businesses. In most countries, the top 5 retail players are the local banks with multinationals playing for the number 5 to number 10 position in retail banking market share,” said Chadha, founder of APAC Financial. Echoing this view is Amrish Rau, CEO of Pine Labs and a veteran of the credit card business. According to Rau, the concept of a massive global consumer bank is dead. “With the rise of the fintechs, banks are realising that they have to make large investments in newer technology to retain their customers. At the same time, they are under higher scrutiny and facing increased regulations while the capital available is the same. This is compelling banks to spend more in defending their business in domestic markets.” According to Chaddha, while mid-sized countries may not be attractive for MNC banks, India is still an outlier in terms of opportunity. “I still feel that given the huge market size and growth demographics, India along with a couple of other such mega markets, will be continue be a solid opportunity in retail banking for global banks as well,” he said. Some foreign banks complain about the intransigence of regulators. But Chadha says that regulation has not been a factor in any of the exits so far. “India does not stand different from most other emerging markets in terms of regulations, even while degrees may vary. Most of the foreign banks operating in India have had very profitable businesses over a long period, which shows that regulations are well-balanced and supportive to global banks, as much as to local banks,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/why-do-so-many-mnc-banks-give-up-pursuit-of-retail-el-dorado-in-india/articleshow/82108362.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Lucknow||UP: Court to take up three more pleas on Gyanvapi this month||LUCKNOW: After a local court in Varanasi allowed the survey of entire Gyanvapi Mosque complex by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to find out ‘whether the religious structure standing at the present and disputed site is a superimposition, alteration or addition, or there is structural overlapping of any kind’, three more petitions on the issue will be taken up for hearing this month. According to petitioners’ lawyer, HS Jain, the petitions are more or less similar in nature and mention Kashi Vishwanath Temple as ‘the place of cause of action’. “The petitions were filed on different dates in February this year. The local court will hear all the petitions after which there is a possibility that all the petitions get clubbed,” he said. While the hearing of one of the petitions is scheduled for April 19, the other two will be taken up on April 27. One of the petitions, filed on February 18, is a title suit. It says that “the entire property in the radius of 5 kos, called Avimukteshwar Kshetra, vests with the Asthan Adi Vishweshwar, and the deity is the owner of the entire land and property”. The petition seeks the removal of encroachment from the property in question, the “ancient temple” complex existing at settlement plot no. 9130 within the area of Dashashwamedh. The petition has also sought restoration of ‘darshan, puja, aarti, bhog’ and performance of rituals at the principal seat of Asthan of Lord Adi Vishweshwar and of Goddess Maa Shringar Gauri along with other deities within the precincts of temple complex known as “ancient temple” where the Gyanvapi Mosque stands. While the ‘Jyotirlinga’ was damaged in 1669 during the reign of Aurangzeb, other deities including Goddess Maa Shringar Gauri continued to exist within the temple complex which is claimed by Muslims to be a part of Gyanvapi mosque. Another petition says that pujaand rituals ofjalabhishekof Lord Adi Vishweshwar with the fresh water of the Ganga, existing in the north of Shivlingam, be restored and allowed. The suit was filed by the deity, through devotees, asserting the right to be worshipped. The petitions say that every individual has the right to perform puja and rituals as per the tenets of his religion under Article 25 of the Constitution of India. Any obstacle would mean denial of one’s right to religion. The obstacle created before January 26, 1950, has become null and void by virtue of Article 13(1) of the Constitution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/court-to-take-up-three-more-petitions-onkv-temple-gyanvapi-dispute-this-month/articleshow/82109105.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Oxygen supply gets top priority as cases surge||VISAKHAPATNAM: Amid the ongoing second wave of Covid-19 in Andhra Pradesh, the state health department is bracing for increased demand in medical oxygen supply to designated treatment facilities. The department has already created the infrastructure needed at hospitals during the first wave last year by adding oxygen lines to nearly 28,000 beds and installing central oxygen supply systems. According to the state authorities, Andhra Pradesh has the medical oxygen production capacity of about 200 metric tonnes a day. But the distributors are currently placing indents for only some 50-60 metric tonnes. However, due to increased demand, private agencies have increased the prices of household oxygen supply. The state has decided to give top priority to the local supply of medical oxygen, instead of exporting it to other states. It was learnt that the medical oxygen exports to other states from Andhra Pradesh have slowed down in the last few weeks, anticipating the future needs due to the sharp spurt in the number of daily infections. Moreover, the Union government would also allocate oxygen based on the needs of the states. Speaking to TOI, director, Drugs Control Administration, Andhra Pradesh, MBR Prasad, said that Andhra Pradesh has sufficient storage facilities for the produced medical oxygen in the state. “The higher-ups of the health department are constantly monitoring the situation. Against the daily production capacity of 200 metric tonnes of medical oxygen, including from Vizag steel plant, the distributors are currently taking about 60 metric tonnes a day. We would also get oxygen from the neighbouring states. For example, a few Rayalaseema districts get oxygen from Karnataka or Hyderabad,” said Prasad. The director, APDCA, said that top priority in terms of medical oxygen supply would be given to local needs. “If need be, we would get oxygen from other states,” said Prasad. Andhra Pradesh Covid-19 nodal officer Dr K Rambabu said that Andhra Pradesh is well placed in terms of the oxygen supply distribution network at hospitals. “The infrastructure created during the first wave would come in handy even during this time. After hypoxia emerged as the focus area in Covid-19 treatment last year, oxygen lines were created for nearly 28,000 beds from the initial 3,636 oxygen beds. The entral oxygen supply system network has been augmented at all the major hospitals last year itself. The same network would be taken advantage of now,” said Dr Rambabu. The Union health ministry on Thursday asked the states to make rational use of medical oxygen and ensure there is no wastage. The ministry asked the states to set up control rooms to ensure smooth supply of oxygen to the districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/oxygen-supply-gets-top-priority-as-cases-surge/articleshow/82107364.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Meteorologists at the Patna Meteorological Centre, on the other hand, said the state is likely to get comparatively slightly less rainfall. Even the seasonal forecast bulletin issued by the IMD for monsoon 2021 showed that many areas in Bihar and adjoining east Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Jharkhand are likely to receive normal to below-normal rainfall. "As per rainfall quantity and distribution data of the past few years, it has been seen that eastern UP and Bihar received comparatively lesser rainfall. The map released with the seasonal forecast for southwest monsoon also shows that eastern UP, Bihar and Jharkhand among several other places are likely to receive comparatively lesser rainfall. However, things will be clearer regarding the expected rainfall in the upcoming monsoon in an updated forecast to be issued by IMND headquarters in the last week of May," Sanjay Kumar, a meteorologist at the Patna centre told TOI on Friday. Monsoon makes its foray into mainland India through the Kerala coast by June 1 and it is normally scheduled to enter Bihar through the northeastern districts of Purnia and Kishanganj around June 10- 12 and takes another 2- 4 days to cover the entire state. On being asked about the weather conditions expected over the next few days, Sanjay said isolated thundershower activities may occur on Saturday and Sunday. "We had earlier issued a forecast for thundershower activities in an isolated manner in the state on Thursday and Friday. Though such weather development was seen at few places close to the Bihar border in Nepal and Jharkhand but not in Bihar. However, a cyclonic circulation is expected to form over Bihar, which is likely to lead to isolated thundershowers on Saturday and Sunday," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/monsoon-rainfall-in-bihar-likely-to-be-less-than-natl-average/articleshow/82107071.cms||Piyush Tripathi

Secretary of the State Election Commission (SEC) Yogendra Ram said on Friday that a decision in this regard was taken at a two-day meeting which concluded in New Delhi late on Thursday. Senior EC and the state poll panel officials had earlier held different options on the use of EVMs for the first time in the panchayat elections in Bihar. Ballot papers were earlier being used in the panchayat elections in the state. While the SEC advocated the use of multi-post EVMs, the EC insisted on holding the election by using single-post EVMs. The dispute reached the Patna high court, which asked the two poll panels to sort out the issue amicably. SEC secretary Ram said the requirement of the single-post EVMs to elect around 2.58 representatives would be assessed and subsequently the EC was apprised about it. If required, EVMs would be brought from neighbouring states. He, however, clarified that the number of control units and ballot units would be six-time high at each polling booth. Around 1.2 lakh polling booths have been set up for the election which will be held amid Covid-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, state panchayati raj department minister Samrat Choudhary said the process of the election would start in June. However, the term of the existing representatives would come to an end on June 15. With the dispute over the use of EVMs coming to an end, the EC is likely to announce the poll schedule for panchayat election soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/single-post-evms-to-be-used-in-panchayat-polls/articleshow/82107040.cms||Ramashankar

The SHO of Rajeev Nagar police station, Saroj Kumar, said a complaint box has been installed at the entrance to the thana to receive complaints from local people. According to the SHO, officers have been deployed in shifts near the complaint box. The petitions and related documents are sanitised before being handed over to the 'munshi' and investigating officers. The SHO said the complaint box was necessary as the police station didn't have the facility to receive online complaints. "Only offline complaints are received here," he told this newspaper. On average, around 40 complaints are received at the police station every month. Last year, 460 FIRs were lodged despite the lockdown, the SHO added. The Rajeev Nagar police station falls under the jurisdiction of city SP West, and most of the complaints here relate to land grabbing. Earlier, the entry of visitors to the Sardar Patel Bhawan, the new headquarters of the state police, was restricted. The complaints were received by cops at the entrance. "We are also human beings. The deadly virus doesn't differentiate between commoners and police personnel. So, we have taken precautions as well," a constable manning the entrance of the police headquarters said. Sources said other police stations in the capital are likely to follow the precautionary measure initiated by the Rajeev Nagar police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/amid-covid-scare-police-stn-instals-no-contact-complaint-box/articleshow/82106979.cms||Ramashankar

The young goalkeeper, still just 20 years of age, caught the eye in the opening game against Al Wahda and even made it to best XI of ACL matchday one by the Asian Football Confederation. When the second list is drawn, it would be a surprise if he misses out. He was so good. Even coach Juan Ferrando agreed. “In the last minute, Al Wahda had a very good chance (to score) but Dheeraj was superman today. This is the truth. Some chances for us, for them too. I am happy because our chances were not from set pieces. Mostly in build-up, from transition. We need to improve in the last part of the pitch,” said Ferrando.

---||Delhi||Give more beds, oxygen and drugs: CM to Centre||New Delhi: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday called Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan and informed him that due to rapid increase in Covid cases, Delhi was facing a shortage of oxygen, Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and Covid beds. He said that the current wave was three times more fatal, but the central government has provided only 1,800 Covid beds in Delhi so far. During the third wave in November, the Centre had provided 4,100 Covid beds. Kejriwal requested the health minister to give at least 50% beds for Covid out of the 10,000 beds available in central government hospitals, besides providing Remdesivir and Tocilizumab. Delhi is reporting a shortage of ICU beds and oxygen and an overwhelming number of available Covid beds is full. “With the pace at which Covid is spreading, none of us know when it would reach its peak. Delhi reported 24,000 cases today. We don’t know how many new cases would arise in the days to come. Hence, we will have to vigorously prepare for any kind of situation. We must work tirelessly and make the necessary arrangements so that we’re a step ahead of Covid,” the CM said. “I told Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan that there is now a huge shortage of beds in Delhi. In November, the central government allotted us 4,100 beds. This time, they have only provided 1,800 beds. Although, this wave is three times more fatal than the previous ones. In the previous wave, 8,500 was the peak and now, we are currently at 24,000. There are around 10,000 beds of the central government in Delhi. Out of these, at least 50% of beds must be reserved for Covid,” Kejriwal said in a press conference after holding a videoconferencing with all the DMs of Delhi to review the Covid situation. “In AIIMS, there are 1,106 beds in total. Out of these, only 23 have been reserved for Covid. In Safdarjung hospital, there are 2,900 beds out of which only 204 have been reserved for Covid,” Kejriwal said. The CM also informed the health minister that Delhi was facing a shortage of oxygen. “I requested him for an immediate supply of oxygen in Delhi,” Kejriwal said. Kejriwal also requested the Centre to make Remdesivir and Tocilizumab available. “We have always been helped by the central government in the fight against Covid and I hope that this time too, the central government will support Delhi,” the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/give-more-beds-oxygen-and-drugs-cm-to-centre/articleshow/82122365.cms||AlokKNMishra

Sharing details of the strategy to deal with the problem of migrant returnees in the wake of a surge in Covid-19 cases, labour resources department minister Jibesh Kumar said on Friday the situation was assessed at a meeting with senior officials of the department on Thursday. He said the skill set of the migrant returnees will be mapped at panchayat level. While the unskilled workers will be provided employment opportunities under MNREGA, the skilled one will get benefits under the CM Entreprenurship Scheme. The minister said a web portal was developed last year to help the migrant workers stranded in different states. “The officials of the road construction department and rural development department have been asked to work on the plan how to provide employment opportunities to them,” he said. The officials have been asked to make public the list of works undertaken by the department concerned for the benefit of the returnees. Authoritative sources said the skilled workers who have returned were mostly from textile and garment sectors. They cited the example of a group of migrant workers from Champaran region, who had returned from J&K and set up a cricket bat manufacturing unit. On Thursday, the minister also discussed the issue related to tranfer of Rs3,000 to the bank account of each registered migrant worker as annual health allowance. Sources said a sum of Rs446 crore was credited to the bank accounts of altogether 14,87,023 registered migrant workers as annual health allowance for 2020-21 fiscal. The money was transferred to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries under direct credit scheme of the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-to-map-returnees-skills-at-panchayat-level/articleshow/82106994.cms||Ramashankar
---||Pune||Pune: Seven booked on charge of duping builder of Rs 17 crore in investment deal||PUNE: The Hinjewadi police on Thursday registered an FIR of a builder naming seven persons on the charge of duping him of Rs17 crore over an investment deal. The suspects wooed the builder to invest a large amount by promising attractive returns. They paid the returns initially in 2019 but later stopped doing so. They revised their agreement with the builder at least 11 times till the latter realised that the they had no intention of returning his principal amount and interest, the police said. Assistant inspector Shashikant Dendge of the Hinjewadi police said the complainant came in contact with the suspects through a common friend. “The suspects running an investment firm told the builder to invest in some international projects and promised him good returns,” he said. Dendge said the suspects initially gave returns to the builder on his investment and wooed him to invest more. “The builder went on investing money with the suspects. The suspects used to promise more returns and revise the agreement each time. A friend of the builder also invested some amount with the suspects,” he said. The assistant inspector said the complainant realised that the suspects had been duping him when he did not get the returns and the principal amount. “The suspects had told him that they were not able to return the amount because of the Covid-19 outbreak,” Dendge said. He said when the complainant started pursuing the suspects for his money, they sent him a legal notice claiming he was harassing them and if anything happened to the main suspect, the notice would be treated as his dying declaration, Dendge said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/seven-booked-on-charge-of-duping-builder-of-rs-17cr-in-investment-deal/articleshow/82108627.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Patna||Bihar: Four-day Chaiti Chhath begins on low-key note amid pandemic||PATNA: The four-day Chaiti Chhath began with ‘nahay-khay’ on Friday amid Covid restrictions. While many decided not to celebrate the festival this time, others kept it a low-key affair owing to the pandemic. Jaishreya, whose mother used to fast for 36 consecutive hours twice a year on Chhath and Chaiti Chhath, said she suggested the latter not to do so this time. “I told her to skip the festival this time due to the pandemic,” she said. Many, however, performed the rituals with precautions. Devotees took a dip in the Ganga and prepared ‘prasad’ on the first day. Some, on the other hand, bathed at home with Gangajal instead of going to the ghats and distributed ‘prasad’ among family members only. Amrit Lal, a resident of Kankarbagh who used to invite over 500 people on ‘kharna’, said the festival would be a low-key affair this time. “We will observe the festival at home and pray for the end of the pandemic,” he said. Keeping in mind the Covid-19 pandemic, the Patna Municipal Corporation is providing Gangajal to people in the city at their doorsteps. Several clean tankers were placed at important places in the district to supply Ganga water for preparing ‘prasad’ and performing rituals. Meanwhile, city temples which used to prepare artificial ponds for devotees to offer ‘arghya’, will not be part of the festival as the state government had recently closed all religious places closed for common people due to the pandemic. Acharya Pramod of Panch Shiv Mandir at Kankarbagh said the temple would not witness Chhath celebrations for the second time in a row. For small vendors selling wheat, flowers, earthen pots, clay stoves, bamboo baskets (daura), firewood and ‘soop’, sales have been far from satisfactory this time as the number of devotees has come down. “I make hundreds of bamboo baskets for Chhath every year. The demand for larger baskets and vessels are marginal this time. Even the smaller ones are finding few takers,” said Savita Rani, who sells these items on Kankarbagh main road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/four-day-chaiti-chhath-begins-on-low-key-note-amid-pandemic/articleshow/82106959.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Three Ts- testing, tracking, treating to be key in handling Covid-19 cases in city||Prayagraj: The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in a massive surge in cases which has prompted the officials of the health department to conduct surveys for testing, tracking and treating every coronavirus suspect and confirmed cases in all urban, semi-urban and rural areas. For that, the department has engaged as many as 80 medical teams to test, track and treat the patients with the objective that each team would be covering at least 20 houses in a day. As the number of active cases in Prayagraj district has already crossed the figure of 14,500, health officials on Friday claimed to have made additional bed arrangements to treat the patients. Additional chief medical officer and Nodal officer Dr Rishi Sahai told TOI that, "We currently have 2,000-bed facility including 580 ICU beds in 12 hospitals of the city including eight private and four government hospitals to treat the patients”. He added, “We are making efforts to add at least 20 beds per day in the city after seeing the rise in the number of covid patients”. Dr Sahai further claimed that as far as current status was concerned, occupancy in ICU beds was around 90 per cent while over 70 per cent of the patients were in home isolation. Besides, the health department has also set up testing centres in other pockets including Beli road, MG Marg, Daraganj, Beniganj, Dhoomanganj, Naini, and Phaphamau. Moreover, two Mobile Testing Unit (MTU) have also been pressed into service to collect samples. Apart from testing, joint teams of health, administration and police have taken up an extensive exercise to create awareness among the masses in Sangam city. The city on Thursday recorded 2,324 new cases and 12 deaths. The officials have also focussed to strengthen the surveillance system identified pockets that recently recorded maximum cases to ensure the "testing, tracking and treating" of each Covid-19 cases. Health teams have been assigned to collect maximum samples from both rural and urban sectors to check the spread of the disease. Plans are also afoot to set up more Covid-19 level two and three hospitals in the district. As per the health department statistics, the total caseload of the district crossed the 47,000-mark with the addition of new cases. On Friday, a team of local administration, health and police took up an awareness campaign in City pockets and appealed to the people to wear masks. Officials of the health department, meanwhile, claimed health teams have focused on maximum sample collection and contact tracing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/three-ts-testing-tracking-treating-to-be-key-in-handling-covid-19-cases-in-city/articleshow/82107014.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Covid war plans: Increase beds, ramp up tests and start audio-visual counselling||Kolkata: The state government has asked private hospitals to immediately increase Covid beds by 25%. It has also asked government hospitals to hike the Covid bed count by 20%. A major emphasis has also been given on scaling up RT-PCR tests across the city and the rest of the state and simutaneously conduct random testing and contact-tracing. These decisions were taken at a high-level meeting at Nabanna on Friday, said health department sources. The telemedicine process, which is limited to exchange of voices through tele-calling between health experts and the advise seekers, will henceforth be audio-visuals for better interpersonal communications. The telemedicine system had played a crucial role in soothing frayed nerves of agonised relatives of Covid patients by giving them appropriate medical advice during the first wave. The augmentation of the telemedicine process is being done keeping in mind the significant expansion of use of smartphones, said sources in the health department. The state government has also asked the same to ESI hospitals, besides augmenting 12 police hospitals in the state, where 340 beds can be carved out for Covid care for police officials and other frontline health workers, who get infected during their work. Currently, 11 private hospitals are running Covid treatment facilities. In December last year, as many as 57 hospitals extended the services on the instruction from the government. The government may request those hospitals to run similar services yet again. The state has 7,428 Covid beds at present. Even in December last year, there were 13,588 beds earmarked for Covid patients. With the infection rates steadily nosediving, the state government slowly released Covid beds for treatment of non-Covid patients. The current occupancy rate hovers around 35%. “If the number of beds rises, the occupancy rate will decrease,” said a health department officer. It has been decided that besides offering antigen tests at ward clinics, KMC will form a borough-wise crack team for collection of swab from housing complexes and standalone buildings, market places and office buildings. The swab samples will then be sent to SSKM and Calcutta Medical College for RT-PCR tests. “We have six mobile vans that are collecting swab from Covid-affected areas. We will augment our fleet and arrange for collection of swab from all 16 boroughs.

---||Surat||Don’t impose complete lockdown: Industry bodies||Surat: With a steep increase in number of cases in Surat district and in the backdrop of the restrictions laid down by the Maharashtra government on Tuesday night, trade and industrial bodies here have been holding online brainstorming sessions for the past couple of days to come up with strategies to keep the Covid-19 cases among their employees low and keep the economic engine running. The Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industries (SGCCI) conducted several online meetings with 108 associations and bodies affiliated with it to ponder upon how industries can continue functioning with the restrictions if the state government imposes a lockdown. “The meetings were held to know the view of the industry leaders about a voluntary lockdown. But all have turned down the idea and are ready to follow all the guidelines so that employees do not get infected and spread the infection further,” said Dinesh Navadiya, president of SGCCI. “Lockdown is not an option for the business community. If that happens, not only the businessmen but also the workers will suffer,” said Chandu Sheta, who owns a diamond unit. He added that due to the scare of lockdown, around 20 of his workers have already migrated back to their native places. Industry leaders have put up a request before the government that all its employees and workers be also included in the category of frontline workers so that they get eligible for the vaccination drive. It was also decided that employees should be asked to encourage their family members to remain at home and go outside only as the last alternative. Steps such as conducting regular RT-PCR tests and RAT tests of employees were also discussed. “Even if the government declares a lockdown, our only request will be to let the industries operate and for that we are ready to follow all the norms that will be laid down,” Navadiya added. The civic body has been shutting down commercial establishments and shops where eligible employees have not taken the vaccine or have not been put through Covid-19 tests. “All industrialists should take up responsibility of their workers. If cases are reported then they should close down for a couple of days and then restart with precautions. But lockdown will disrupt the entire economy because workers will go away, tax collection will be hampered and payment cycles will also go haywire,” said Jenish Shah, a fabric manufacturer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/dont-impose-complete-lockdown-industry-bodies/articleshow/82108265.cms||---

However, the central bank was not willing to pay a higher price.The central bank also sold lesser amounts in the longer tenure — maturing in 2061 — but higher amounts at the shorter-end of the maturity spectrum (2022). According to RBI data, Rs 5,100-crore government bonds maturing in 2022 were sold on Monday, compared to its earlier announcement that Rs 3,000-crore such bonds will be sold. It managed to sell Rs 6,237-crore bonds maturing in 2061, compared to Rs 9,000-crore announced earlier. It also cancelled the auction of bonds worth Rs 14,000 crore maturing in 2030. In the first auction of FY22 too, G-secs worth nearly Rs 11,000 crore, maturing in 2026, had devolved on bond houses. “Devolvement of the almost entire notified amount of 5-year G-sec last week and cancellation of entire notified amount of 10-year G-sec in (Friday’s) auction indicate weak demand situation for those segments of the yield curve where there is no mandated buying requirement amid hardening rate outlook,” said a debt fund manager. In the last two days, benchmark yield on 10-year G-Sec had jumped from 6% to 6.17% and closed Friday’s session at 6.09%. With the inflation rates, both retail and wholesale, shooting up and rupee depreciating when the government borrowing is at an elevated level, it would be a tough task to manage yields from shooting up in the next few months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-cancels-rs-14k-cr-worth-g-sec-auction/articleshow/82108429.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Allahabad||AU asks inmates to vacate hostels||Prayagraj: Allahabad University Authorities have directed the students to vacate hostels and return to their homes in view of the rising Covid-19 cases. The university has said that the hostels could be converted into Covid wards if needed. University authorities said though AU hostels as well as those of the trusts have been officially closed in August last, a number of inmates were forcefully occupying their rooms. AU authorities had made a number of attempts to free the rooms from the ‘forceful occupants’ and also levied a fine of five time the amount of hostel fee of their stay, but all attempts failed to deter these inmates. Now, the vice-chancellor, through a letter issued by assistant registrar DK Goswami, has once again asked the dean student welfare (DSW) to ensure that the hostels rooms are vacated and inmates asked to go back to their homes for their own safety. The letter of the official mentions that in Uttar Pradesh, Covid cases are continuously rising and the UP government has enforced the Disaster Management Act across the state. In the interest of the students, it is required that they vacate the hostels and return to their home. Further, all classes are being run in online mode and thus student should stay home for their own safety. The DSW has been asked by the VC to take necessary action in this regard and an action-taken report has to be submitted to the VC. Interestingly, the letter of the assistant registrar, which was circulated by the assistant public relation officer of AU in the media, also mentions the fact that the hostels of AU could be converted into Covid wards if needed. It mentions, “It is also a fact that hospitals are facing crises and hostels will be converted in the Covid wards.” This holds ground as the city is witnessing an acute shortage of beds in different hospitals for patients infected with coronavirus. If things do not improve, there is a possibility that the administration would need more buildings to be converted into Covid wards and AU hostels could be taken over for the purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/au-asks-inmates-to-vacate-hostels/articleshow/82107053.cms||---

Patna continues to be the epicentre of the second wave of the pandemic in the state, though the daily caseload came down to 1,364 compared to 2,105 on Thursday. Apart from the state capital, Gaya is emerging as the second biggest Covid hotspot in the state as its daily caseload surged from 431 on Thursday to 590 on Friday. Muzaffarpur (393), Bhagalpur (386), Begusarai (257), Saran (248) , Aurangabad (182), Munger (173) and Rohtas (169) were a few other districts with a relatively high number of positive cases.

Bhagalpur (98), Munger (60) Saran (65), Nalanda (63) and East Champaran (56) were a few other districts with high Covid deaths so far. Of the 25 deaths on Friday, 13 were officially reported by the health department while nine deaths were reported in the daily bulletin of the NMCH, and the remaining three deaths were reported by AIIMS- Patna. Apart from the sharp spike in cases and deaths, Bihar’s recovery rate also continues to plunge with every passing day.

---||Patna||Bihar: Second wave of Covid puts children at risk||PATNA: The second wave of Covid pandemic has not spared even children, who were largely safe during the initial phase of the pandemic last year. As the children do not have access to Covid vaccines, experts said stricter surveillance by parents was the solution. Dr Arun Shah, a Muzaffarpur-based senior paediatrician and former president of Indian Academy of Paediatrics-Bihar, said at least 8% children in the country have contracted Covid with varying symptoms and severity in the second wave. “As opposed to the first wave, a reverse trend is being noticed this time with children developing symptoms at a higher rate. In the first wave, children were asymptomatic. However, they are now developing symptoms like fever, cold, dry cough, loose motion and vomiting,” Dr Shah said. Dr Shah said no treatment of children below 18 years has been prescribed yet either by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) or World Health Organisation (WHO). “If critically diagnosed, the treatment is challenging as drugs like Ramdesevir and Cortisol steroids, which are effective on adults, have produced no clinical surety in any trial for children,” he said. Dr Nigam Prakash Narain, former head of department of paediatrics at Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), said two new Covid-19 manifestation in children have emerged. “First is the MIS-C (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children) which is a rare but life-threatening systemic illness involving persistent fever and extreme inflammation. The other is the Kawasaki-like syndrome which is a result of an immunologic response to an exposure in the respiratory system or gastrointestinal tract or both in genetically susceptible children,” he explained. The paediatrician said if a child is showing symptoms of Covid-19 infection with history of exposure to an infected person and the symptoms persist for over three days, test should be done immediately. “The recommended method to distinguish between common flu and Covid is to monitor oxygen levels in the body, not just for children but adults too,” he said. Stating that the condition in Bihar is likely to get worse, Dr Rajiv Kumar, head of department of paediatrics at Kejriwal Hospital, Muzaffarpur, said containment and caution is the way forward to prevent deaths and severe illnesses in children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/second-wave-of-covid-puts-children-at-risk/articleshow/82107834.cms||---
---||Business||SBI, private banks seen to be in race for Citi’s card business||MUMBAI: Citi’s decision to quit the Indian market has thrown up an opportunity for domestic private banks that are looking to scale up their credit card business. SBI Card, a subsidiary of State Bank of India, saw its share price jump 7.5% by close of Friday’s trade on the BSE. According to payments industry sources, the biggest player in the card business — HDFC Bank — is hamstrung by the restrictions placed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on acquiring fresh customers. SBI, besides benefiting from the slowdown in issuance among rivals, is also seen as a contender for Citi’s cards business. Read AlsoCitigroup to exit 13 global consumer banking markets, including India, ChinaCitigroup announced on Thursday that it will exit 13 international consumer banking markets, shifting its focus to wealth management and away from retail banking in places where it is small.According to Macquarie Capital research analyst Suresh Ganapathy, Citi is likely to sell individual business segments to different players. And multiple banks are interested in the card business. “We believe smaller players like RBL, IDFC First Bank, etc, could be more aggressive in terms of bidding for the credit card book,” said Ganapathy. Citibank, which was at one time a leader in credit card spends, lost significant market share over the years. Even before the present decision to exit the retail business in India, the bank had scaled down its branch business and gone slow on credit card acquisitions and tie-ups. However, bankers say that the credit card portfolio is a high-quality one given that it has a large number of high net worth customers. As a result, the average card spend is significantly higher than the industry’s. Considering that SBI Card — with a 20% market share — has a valuation of over Rs 90,000 crore, bankers estimate the Citi’s card portfolio to be worth at least Rs 22,000 crore. While the RBI has recently amended norms recognising standalone credit card companies, bankers say that the prospective acquirer will need a branch network for collections. Besides private banks and SBI Card, there is a likelihood that foreign banks might also show interest. “Foreign banks might also look to expand presence, and we note that DBS had recently acquired branches of Indian bank (LVB) to expand presence in India — other large foreign banks in India are HSBC and StanChart,” said Jefferies in a report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sbi-pvt-banks-seen-to-be-in-race-for-citis-card-biz/articleshow/82108385.cms||---

The helpdesk woman could be heard telling the patient, a local BJP leader Santosh Singh, to die with his family. Singh is the son of a former BJP city president, Manohar Singh. Speaking to TOI, he said, “After testing positive for Covid on April 12, our family went into self-quarantine. On Thursday morning around 8:14 am, we received a call from ICCC (phone number 0522-2723468). The woman caller asked us, if we had downloaded the home isolation app and filled the details. I informed her that no one told us to do so and no doctor had contacted them. Suddenly, the woman got infuriated and told us to die and hung up.” “I filed a complaint with the district magistrate and marked copy to chief minister Yogi Adityanath. We are already under tremendous stress and won’t accept such behaviour,” he said. This is not a stray incident. Scores of Covid patient’s relatives told TOI, they were unable to contact the helpline even after 24 hours or received any assistance. In fact, many requests were posted on district administration’s social media platform for urgent help, but nobody took cognizance. For instance, a 66-year-old Indiranagar resident posted his requests six times over 24 hours, but to no avail. “Our patient’s oxygen saturation level dipped to 70 and the ICCC caller told us to make the patient sleep upside down and call the helpline if his condition deteriorated. We tried again, but the line went dead. Later, we posted the request on a social media group of the district administration, but didn’t receive any response,” said the relative of corona-positive patients. A senior doctor affiliated to IMA said, “ICCC is unable to handle the flood of calls. Even if a call goes through, there’s no guarantee of hospitalisation. For home isolation, the government has recommended Ivermectin, paracetamol, mild anti-biotics and vitamins, but still many patients are unable to recover. And the helpline provides no succour.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-helpdesk-caller-tells-patient-to-die-audio-goes-viral/articleshow/82109011.cms||Arvind Chauhan

The number of active cases also increased to 11,756 till Thursday, making the situation troublesome. Though the local authorities claimed to have enhanced medical facilities for the care of corona patients, the continued surge of new Covid-19 cases is uncontrollable and restrictions have been imposed in the district to check the spread of the coronavirus. District magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said, “Arrangements for Covid testing have been made at different places, including railway stations, bus stand, Sir Sunderlal Hospital of Banaras Hindu University, SSPG Divisional Hospital and the hospitals at Bhelupur and Ramnagar. People are advised to get tested for their own safety.” He also appealed to the migrants coming from other places to give required information to the Covid Control Room over phone. The health department has been doing sampling of the migrants, he added. Acting chief medical officer Dr. NP Singh said, “The patients in home isolation are being contacted regularly over phone to know their condition. People should be careful even if their test reports come negative and follow Covid protocol. On Thursday, 6,011 people were vaccinated at different government and private hospitals.” Meanwhile, the district administration has imposed restrictions like night curfew and ban of public gatherings. Commissioner of police A Satish Ganesh also talked to the representatives of various organisations of traders seeking their support in Covid control. While the district administration ordered closure of markets on Saturday and Sunday, the local traders’ communities also came forward to put a check on the spread. The Varanasi Kirana Vyapar Samiti has announced a complete closure of Visheshwarganj Mandi, the largest mandi in eastern UP, from April 19 to 24. This decision was taken at an emergency meeting of the office-bearers on Thursday in view of the rapid increase in Covid-19 cases. Besides, joint secretary of the Anjuman Masajid Intezamiya Committee SM Yasin also appealed to the Muslim community to follow Covid guidelines issued by the district administration and offer namaz at home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/covid-surges-in-kashi-13756-cases-36-deaths-reported-in-last-15-days/articleshow/82107202.cms||---

As more and more people are coming back from different cities of Maharashtra and Gujarat, there is also a mad rush among them to reach their native places through buses, operated by roadways. Since the last ten days or so, the number of passengers, including both local student and aspirants of different competitive exams and those returning to the city from various cities of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan etc. has increased multi-fold. The chunk of these passengers reach Sangam city through different trains and move towards their natives places in buses being operated by UP state roadways transport corporation (UPSRTC). Although there has been added load on different bus depot operating buses in different directions in the city, there are only a few who seriously follows the precautions suggested by the government. Most of the passengers can be spotted wearing mask only to cover their chin while few others are without masks. The guard on duty at the bus stand seldom asks them to wear the mask, but there is no one to listen to his valuable advice. Likewise, the numbers in terms of students and aspirants leaving the city too have increased. Despite the threat of the virus, only around 50 per cent of these passengers can be spotted wearing a mask. As the numbers of Covid positive patients has increased in the city in the past one week, more and more youngsters, who had come to the city from different neighbouring districts for education are leaving the city. Likewise, the roads and markets are also witnessing thin attendance as customers are refraining from coming out to buy anything barring the essential commodity. Considering the seriousness of the situation and the continued duty performed by the staff members of UPSRTC, the regional manager of UPSRTC, TK Bisen inspected different depot of the district and met the staff members. The official interacted with the drivers and conductors, gave patience listening to the problems being faced by them and also cautioned them to follow all the protocols given the rising number of corona cases in the district and neighbouring districts. “Our staff is under direct contact with the common man and as such, they are vulnerable to getting infected. As such I have told them to wear a mask, carry sanitiser with them and be at a safe distance with the passengers”, said the RM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/as-virus-cases-go-up-people-in-city-in-a-rush-to-head-back-at-native-places/articleshow/82107122.cms||---

Officials said Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Ltd (BRPNNL), the implementing agency of the project, is finalising the detailed project report (DPR). It is likely to be submitted to the state government within a week for administrative and technical approval. The DPR envisages that the proposed Lakshman Jhoola would be a 370 metres skywalk from Deo ghat to Sita Kund. It will be constructed by utilising an estimate outlay of Rs65-68 crore. It would reduce the distance between Deo ghat and the Sita Kund to less than half km from 4km. Gaya DM Abhishek Singh said: "The bridge will be convenient to the devotees. A rubber dam is proposed on Falgu river. After the rubber dam is completed, at least two feet water will remain permanently in the riverbed. Once the bridge is completed, devotees will not have to wade through thr river to reach Sita Kund." A senior member of Gayapal panda samaj, Mahesh Guput, said, “Sita Kund is situated east of Vishnupad temple. The place has great spiritual importance in terms of pind-daan. It is mentioned in the religious texts that Lord Rama along with his wife Sita had come to Gaya to perform pind-daan of his father Dashrath. When Rama and Lakshman went to bring some pind-daan materials, Sita offered a pind of sand at the place.” The devotees want to visit Sita Kund also. But now the route to reach there is around 4km-long. Although the Falgu riverbed remains dry except in the rainy season, it is very difficult to reach there on foot because walking on sand in scorching sun is very difficult for the devotees, most of them being elderly people. After the pedestrian bridge is completed, more people will be visiting Sita Kund. Beautification of Deo ghat adjacent to Vishnupad temple and the Sita Kund has been made from ‘Hriday’ scheme. A ghat has been made at Deo ghat with other facilities like toilets and changing rooms. At Sita Kund, lights have been installed and a beautiful park developed to attract devotees and the tourists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/dpr-of-lakshman-jhoola-at-gaya-to-be-ready-soon/articleshow/82107087.cms||---

Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) has announced that water supply will start from July 31. Supply of water will start from phase V and VI of Kajauli Water works, said GMADA chief engineer Davinder Singh. “Work on construction of water augmentation plant at Signpura village is nearing completion and will be completed by July 31. The same day, water from Kajauli will be released for Mohali,” he said. GMADA has already initiated the process of construction of a water augmentation plant at the site with works handed over to France-based Veolia India in 2018. The plant is to come up on 34 acres of land with a deadline of 18 months. It was to be completed by March 2021 but will now be completed by July 31, 2021 due to the pandemic. In 2019, the project was halted for some time as land in Signpura was acquired by GMADA for the purpose but a temple already existed there. GMADA struck a deal with a religious faction and awarded compensation in the form of an alternate piece of land but failed to get possession of the temple land, said sources. Sources in the Punjab ministry said Haryana government has asked Punjab to start water augmentation from Kajauli to Mohali and Panchkula simultaneously. Mohali is to get 5 million gallons per day (MGD) of potable water after completion of phases V and VI of Kajauli water works and two MGD is to be diverted to Panchkula. The water supply department of Punjab, Kajauli Waterworks is located on the Bhakra mainline canal near Morinda in Ropar. It caters to water requirement of Chandigarh, Mohali and Chandimandir. In 1983, an agreement of water distribution from Bhakra through Kajauli was signed, which stated that it would be supplied to Mohali, Chandigarh, Chandimandir and Panchkula. Kajauli waterworks was to have various phases. Four phases have been completed, from which 20 MGD (millions of gallons per day) of water is available from each phase. Water from Kajauli reaches the treatment plant in Sector 39, Chandigarh and feeds five other waterworks of the city, including sectors 52, 37, 32, 26 and 12. From a single phase, Chandigarh receives 14.5 million gallons, Mohali gets three MGD, Chandimandir gets 1.5 MGD and Panchkula gets 2 MGD. Earlier, the target of completion of potable water augmentation from phase V and VI of Kajauli water works was December 2020 but with GMADA facing labour crunch, the project was delayed till May 2021. The labour crunch was a fallout of the lockdown due to Covid-19 pandemic in the country when over 26,000 labourers in Mohali returned to their native places in Bihar, UP, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh, leaving industrialists, builders and farmers high and dry. Before this, the project was stalled by a religious structure. While GMADA did not take possession of the land where the temple was situated after acquiring it, it stopped the temple management from making fresh construction on the premises. Later, the temple was demolished but this wasted time. In May 2012, GMADA started laying pipelines to supply 80 MGD water to Mohali district and Chandigarh from Kajauli water works (phases 5 and 6) at a cost of Rs 200 crore, of which Rs 100 crore was to be borne by Chandigarh. Under phases 5 and 6, 40 MGD water was to be supplied, of which 35 MGD was reserved for Chandigarh and 5 MGD for Mohali. Mohali gets 10 MGD water from Kajauli water works and 10 MGD from 75 tubewells but is still short of 12 MGD, especially during the summer. Kajauli water works is located on the Bhakra mainline canal near Morinda in Ropar district from where water requirements of Chandigarh, Mohali and Chandimandir are met.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-to-get-5-mgd-portable-water-from-kajauli-by-july-31/articleshow/82107928.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

The exits are also higher by 81% compared to the previous quarter (October-December), which recorded $2.3 billion in exits from 44 deals.A surge in strategic sale among PE-VC backed companies and open market exits contributed to the momentum. Strategic sales worth $1.8 billion across nine deals were recorded in January-March compared to $601 million in the immediately preceding quarter and $397 million in the same quarter last year. The largest exit in the period was Tata’s acquisition of a part of BigBasket for around $1 billion, which saw Alibaba, IFC, and Abraaj sell their stake. 22 open market exits worth $1.1 billion followed strategic deals in comprising bulk of the transactions. American PE firm Carlyle Group selling part of its stake in SBI Cards & Payments Services for almost $542 million, a year after the latter went public, was the largest open market exit for the period.“Q121 (Jan-March 2021) has recorded nine PE-backed IPOs, which is the highest quarterly number so far. Should the mid-cap / small-cap indices remain buoyant and not become volatile, we expect to see many more PE-backed companies hitting the capital markets this year given the healthy appetite for primary issuances,” Vivek Soni, partner and national leader, PE services, EY said.There are over 90 companies that have filed their draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with SEBI of which more than 45 are PE-backed, EY’s report said. E-commerce has emerged as the new IPO intense sector wherein six companies have filed their DRHPs including Zomato, Nykaa, and Grofers, it added. Exits via secondary sale (i.e. sale to other PE funds) stood at $489 million from 13 deals compared to $25 million in the same quarter last year from just six deals. Sectorally, financial services recorded the highest value of exits in the period ($1.2 billion across 14 deals) followed by the Covid-resilient sector e-commerce at $1 billion across six deals. While the performance of exits in the quarter factors in the vaccine roll-out and economic optimism in January-February, all eyes are on the surge of the second wave of Covid-19 to see how it impacts optimism in public and private markets.“Investors could turn cautious till more clarity emerges on govt response to the second wave,” Soni said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/at-4-2bn-pe-vc-exits-double-in-jan-mar-2021/articleshow/82107974.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||Lucknow||Second Covid wave hits students hard||Lucknow: The second Covid wave has hit the student community hard with research, practicals and assignment stuck halfway and the fear of session derailment is giving students sleepless nights. Students of Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University (AKTU), Dr Shakuntala Misra National Rehabilitation University (DSMNRU) and Khwaja Moinnuding Chisti Language University (KMCLU) shared how their studies which were gradually coming back on track got halted once again. “I have been researching in the robotics laboratory of my college to develop multiple robots and drones that can work like a ‘bee swarm’ and can be used for disaster management. My target was to complete it before graduating from the university, but due to the second wave I have to leave the work midway as the university has switched to the online study mode,” said MTech student Aditya Singh. He said making such robots is only possible at the university’s laboratory that is equipped with hi-tech equipment. “Since this is my last semester, by the time Covid cases go down I will complete my degree but my robot research won’t complete.” Shivangi, a PhD student of zoology department of Dr Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, said “I am in a hurry to complete my PhD as already due to Covid one year has been wasted. I was working on color pattern formation on ladybirds and I need a laboratory to complete my research work. But since the university is closed I have to leave the research midway.” She said the research work of almost all scholars of science departments have been adversely affected as from chemicals to sample, to various apparatus, everything is available only on the campus. Also as there is a rise in Covid cases nobody knows when we will be back to the laboratories and whether the samples left half way will remain in good conditions by then. Meanwhile, students of KMCLU and DSMNRU shared that they were fortunate that their examinations ended before the second wave. “But result will definitely be late as the faculty cannot go to the varsity for evaluation purposes due to Covid protocol,” said KMCLU BA student Satyam Shukla. He added that the academic session is already late by four-month and delay in declaration of results would further derail the session. “In offline classes, teachers were regular with lectures and we were hoping that the syllabus will complete on time. But online classes are not running as per schedule as a number of faculty are not regular,” said a LU student Vishal Singh. Meanwhile, University officials said that they will give extra time to students to complete their research work and assignments and will try to conduct extra classes online.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/second-covid-wave-hits-students-hard/articleshow/82109001.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Vineeta Singh, a resident of Charbagh, said, “Our house was barricaded after my husband and I tested Covid positive on April 11. No grocery or general shop owner wants to home deliver products as our home has been declared a containment zone.” Families are finding it hard to get medicines. “My elder brother keeps the required medicines and other products at our doorstep before leaving for office in the morning. However, if we have any immediate requirement thereafter, nobody comes forward to help us,” said “ said Nikhil Chaurasiya, a resident of Manaknagar. Not just affected families, people living in the apartments where positive cases have been reported are facing problems. “After our apartment building was declared a containment zone after a family in the flats was found Covid-19 positive, maids have stopped coming and local shops in the vicinity are not ready to deliver products at home,” said Smita Upadhyay of Alambagh. Anand Kashyap, a resident of Jankipuram Sector-H, said, “Why should we suffer because our neighbours have tested positive? My father is diabetic and we order his medicine through a medical shop near our home. But, when we contacted him to deliver the medicines, he denied and said `sir please come to the shop to collect medicines’.” Complaints against ICCC galore Lucknow: There were also a number of complaints regarding poor response from the Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) established by the district administration to assist patients in home isolation. Relatives of Covid-19 patients said that the ICCC is taking three-four days in contact tracing and delivering medicines. Avinash Bhatnagar, a resident of Jankipuram, said, “I called ICCC to help me in getting tested after my son turned Covid-19 positive on Monday. The operator told me that a team will come the next day for contact tracing and give medicines, but no one has reached us till date.” Aashee Singh of Yahiyaganj said, “She has high fever and has no smell or taste. We have kept him in isolation, but want to get her tested, but the contact number of ICCC always remains busy. We have no clue on how to deal with the situation,” said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/home-isolation-patientsdecry-poor-arrangements/articleshow/82109017.cms||Pranchal Srivastava

The Madhya Pradesh government has though, allowed the MLAs to use local areas development (LAD) fund to spend on ventilators, PPE kits and other equipment through district administration."I have urged the chief minister and state finance minister to increase the voluntary grant from Rs 15 lakh to Rs one crore so that a financial assistance could be provided to the Covid patients directly for purchasing Remdesivir injections or on CT Scan. This would help them in managing expenses other than hospital admission and medicines," Sisodia told TOI. Sisodia said that the financial assistance will be approved to the patients after confirming the doctor's prescription and injection bill through their Aadhar Card. "We can provide help up to Rs 50,000 to the patients for six months if the grant is increased to Rs one crore," he said. Meanwhile, the state Planning, Economic and Statistics department has allowed the district authorities to purchase necessary medical equipment and making requisite preventive medical arrangements on the recommendations of the concerned MLA."The district collectors can utilise the MLA LAD funds to provide infrared thermometers, PPE kits for medical staff and doctors fighting out the Covid-19, corona testing kits, setting up of ICU ventilator, isolation or quarantine wards. The paramedical staff will also get face masks, gloves and sanitizers apart from other medical equipment or machines as suggested by the Union Ministry of Health. For this, recommendations of the concerned MLA of the constituency would be pre-requisite. The arrangement has been made one-time dispensation only for the financial year 2021-22," according to an official statement.The MLAs are provided Rs 1.70 crore for local area development while Rs15 lakh are given as voluntary grant. The government has approved to utilise the total Rs1.85 crore to combat Covid-19. MLA Sisodia said that the government should also allow the MLAs to spend directly on petty expenses of the Covid patients which would be of great help to them. In a recent virtual meeting between the MLAs and the chief minister, it was a common demand to covert the LAD into voluntary fund. The legislators had said that they were ready to spend about 50% of the total amount on providing oxygen, sanitizers, injection and ventilators to the affected people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bjp-mla-sisodia-seeks-hike-in-local-area-devpt-fund-to-rs-1-crore-for-covid-19-relief/articleshow/82108636.cms||---

The blast is suspected to be caused by firecrackers or a crude bomb. Civic workers Nitin, Vikas and Suraj were loading garbage near Nala Macchrata locality in a tractor-trolley. The spade of one of them hit an object following which a powerful explosion took place, injuring them and a tractor-trolley driver Amir. Police suspect that either a firecracker or a crude bomb dumped in the garbage, exploded. Circle Officer City Nitesh Singh said, “Initial reports suggested that firecrackers caused the blast. They might have exploded after being hit by a spade. We are investigating.” The three contractual Nagar Palika employees had gone to collect garbage from Macchrata locality at around 8.15 am when the incident took place. Doctors at a nearby hospital, where the four were treated, said they had injuries, but are out of danger, CO said further. Residents and shopkeepers initially thought that it was a sound of tyre burst. “I was sitting at my shop when I heard a loud powerful explosion. I thought a tyre of the tractor-trolley in which civic employees were loading garbage had a flat tyre. When I came out, I saw a lot of dust and then rushed to the garbage dump,” said Avinash, who has a shop that is a few metres from the blast site.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/4-hurt-in-garbage-dumpblast-in-farrukhabad/articleshow/82108745.cms||---

---||Patna||Many private hospitals with Covid patients face oxygen crisis in Patna||PATNA: Most of the private hospitals in the city having Covid patients faced serious crisis of oxygen cylinders on Friday. Ruban hospital with 154 Covid patients admitted in its ward required about 300 oxygen cylinders in a day, but it had only 150 by Friday evening. “Though the district administration is monitoring the supply of oxygen cylinders and the situation has improved, but, the demand is higher than supply,” its managing director Dr Satyajeet Singh and added that the crisis prevailed despite the hospital generating oxygen to fill 80 cylinders from its own plant every day. The situation was worse at High-tech hospital which refused many patients due to oxygen shortage. “We need at least 130 cylinders every day, but the hospital has only 20. Our staff are busy in arranging at least 25 more for emergency requirement for the next 12 hours,” said Dr Abhay Pandey, its Covid ward nodal officer. He said due to oxygen crisis, only 22 patients were admitted in the 30-bed Covid ward. We now refer serious patients needing oxygen support to PMCH, NMCH or AIIMS-Patna as they have strong oxygen supply chains. Similar was the situation at Atlantis hospital having 14 patients in the 30-bed Covid ward. “We have only three cylinders against the daily requirement of 100,” said its managing director Dr Ravi Prakash. He also admitted that the entire medical team was busy in exploring sources to get more oxygen cylinders. The quality manager of Ford hospital, Pradeep sharma, said 175 cylinders were in stock against the daily requirement of 350 for 55 Covid patients admitted. The managing director of Jagdish memorial hospital, Dr Alok Kumar, said the hospital staff on Thursday night remained busy in arranging oxygen from neighbouring private hospitals. “We have 30 Covid patients for which at least 80 oxygen cylinders are required per day, but the hospital has only 20 by Friday evening,” he said. Another Covid hospital facing oxygen crisis was Pushpanjali hospital. “We could get about 20 cylinders against the requirement of 100 for 34 Covid patients admitted in the hospital,” said its director Avinash Kumar Pandey. He, however, appreciated the government’s steps to maintain the oxygen supply chain and hoped things would improve in the next few days. PMCH, however, had no oxygen crisis. Its superintendent Dr IS Thakur said the hospital has adequate oxygen not only for Covid but other patients as well. He admitted that several Covid patients from different places were rushing to PMCH every hour and 105 patients were admitted in the 112-bed Covid ward by evening. “In addition, an emergency oxygen generation plant would become functional on the PMCH campus next week,” Dr Thakur said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/many-private-hospitals-with-covid-patients-face-oxygen-crisis-in-patna/articleshow/82107852.cms||VK Tripathi

Visitors, including those who come to have their grievances heard, are being allowed only with the prior permission of senior officials. The health department carried out RT-PCR tests on about 200 employees at the secretariat in Velagapudi on Friday. The department has decided to conduct Covid-19 screening on employees every Friday as part of measures to contain the virus. Senior officials in the secretariat are reported to have directed the security chief that the general public should submit their representations at the entry point. The Andhra Pradesh Special Police (APSP) that guards the secretariat has been directed not to allow any visitors, including contractors, to meet senior officials or ministers. Officials of Central Power Distribution Company Limited (CPDCL) have directed its field offices to prevent the entry of visitors. “No one except employees will be allowed to enter our office,” confirmed superintending engineer (SE), CPDCL, A Murali Mohan. Arrangements have been made to collect bill payments at counters outside the circle office. Letters and documents sent from other offices will be sent to concerned sections only after sanitisation at the entry point. “We have requested all field offices and other departments to route requests and other relevant documents through e-office/email/fax, SAP mail mode instead of sending hard copies,” Murali Mohan told TOI. In fact, staff in all electricity offices have been instructed to follow Covid-19 precautions while entering the office premises.

The CM held a video conference with health officials and district collectors on Friday from his Tadepalli camp office. The CM told officials that despite the successful vaccination drive in the state, increasing cases pose a threat. He wanted officials to focus equally on vaccination and Covid-19 tests. The CM told officials the state is trying to get more doses of the vaccine. Stating the government has conducted 1.55 crore tests in the past year, he said the recovery rate had gone up to 96.19% while positive cases have come down to 6.03%.

Referring to the second wave, the CM said cases are increasing in Chittoor, Srikakulam, Visakhapatnam, Krishna, Guntur and Nellore districts and wanted health officials of the districts to focus on tests and vaccination. The CM said 108 hospitals have been empanelled for Covid-19 treatment and out of 15,669 beds in these hospitals, 4,889 are occupied and directed officials to increase availability of beds. He instructed officials to ensure oxygen facilities, food quality in hospitals, sanitation, medication, doctors and paramedical staff. The 13,500 beds in Covid care centres should be increased to 50,000, he said, and patients with no separate room for isolation at home should be shifted to a Covid care centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/stay-alert-to-tackle-second-wave-jagan/articleshow/82107386.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Kolkata||West Bengal govt asks private hospitals to hike Covid beds by 20%||KOLKATA: The state will soon issue an advisory to private hospitals about pushing back elective admissions and surgeries so that more beds can be used to treat Covid patients. Private hospitals have also been asked to increase Covid beds by 20% in view of the sharp spurt in the number of cases. At a meeting with private hospitals conducted by the chairman of West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission (WBCERC), Asim Bandopadhyay, on Friday, hospitals were asked to focus on setting up satellite centres to bear the rising load of Covid patients. The WBCERC said that it was ready to issue an advisory to hotels that have allegedly been charging very high to let hospitals use their facilities as satellite centres. “The commission has sought an immediate increase in the number of both beds and satellite centres. Since hotels have often been quoting a high charge, the commission has assured us that it will restrict it through an advisory,” said a private hospital head. The hospitals were also asked to make sure that Swasthya Sathi patients were not refused. Several hospitals had earlier claimed that they would have to restrict non-Covid admissions if enough room was to be created for extending Covid units. “We have been finding it difficult since the flow of non-Covid patients remains high. Elective surgeries, too, are taking place. So we welcome the commission’s decision to allow restricting non-Covid admissions. It is the only way we can admit more Covid patients,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. The shortage in supply of Remdesivir — an essential Covid drug — was also discussed. The commission has assured hospitals that it will negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to ease the supply. “We are ready to extend our Covid unit by 10%. Satellite centres, too, will be added,” said RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences zonal head R Venkatesh. Hospitals have been asked to revert with their plans within the next two days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-asks-private-hospitals-to-hike-cov-beds-by-20/articleshow/82107855.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Thirty-three medical officers and seven medical officers under indemnity bond have been asked to report to work at various Covid hospitals with immediate effect. “We enhanced manpower at the beginning of this month. We will be augmenting the workforce strength in future, too, as and when the situation demands. This will be a continuous process so we have enough doctors to take care of the patients,” said a Swasthya Bhawan source. From only 6,513 active cases across the state on April 1, the number has now gone up to 41,047 on Friday. For Kolkata, the number went up by over five times — from 2,519 cases to 11,491 cases — during the same period. Additionally, hospital occupancy rose from a mere 9.9% to 36.5%. These doctors, many of who are specialists, have been pooled from different districts where they had been working at rural, block or district hospitals. While MR Bangur Hospital and CNCI Rajarhat got the lion’s share of these doctors, some have also been sent to Baltikuri ESI Hospital, Howrah and Canning Covid Hospital. MR Bangur Hospital and CNCI Rajarahat went for a major hike in number of beds recently. At present, the two Covid facilities have 713 and 425 beds respectively. “MR Bangur and CNCI Rajarhat are bearing a major Covid load. That is why we had to augment the manpower, especially after the recent increase in beds,” said a senior health department official. Sources at the health department indicated they would be sending more doctors and supportive staffers to KS Roy TB Hospital in Jadavpur, which recently became functional as a 130-bed Covid hospital. Along with doctors, the health department is also extending the contract of support staff, like that of scavengers for Covid hospitals and technicians for its laboratories where possible Covid samples are being tested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/health-dept-boosts-manpower-at-govt-covid-care-facilities-as-cases-rise/articleshow/82107892.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The letter dated April 13 leaked to the media does not reveal the nature of the information but mentioned that “one head constable and a home guard of Intelligence department were one of the first to arrive at the scene on getting to know of the death, even before the local inspector and DSP reached.” “But they were not allowed inside the house by the family members, who were present there including Avinash Reddy, MP,” the now suspended IPS officer wrote. After the AP high court handed over the investigation to the CBI, Rao said that he had contacted NM Singh, the joint director of CBI, who is supervising the case and told him that he has information relating to the case. Rao claimed that NM Singh then agreed to take the information but there was no effort from his team in that direction. “I called him again on July 22, 2020 at his Delhi office and reminded him. He agreed to direct his team to gather the available information from me but so far, there’s no action,” Rao writes. “It is surprising that the CBI investigation team has not taken any interest when a DGP rank police officer, that too one who worked as DG, Intelligence at the time of the murder, has been volunteering to provide information to help solve a serious murder case which remained unsolved for more than one year after the CBI taking it over,” Rao states. Rao requested the CBI investigating officials to collect information present with him and place it on record. Vivekananda Reddy was murdered in his house in Pulivendula on the intervening night of March 14 and 15 in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/abv-writes-to-cbi-on-vivekas-murder/articleshow/82107409.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Vijayawada||Capital status for Vizag may be on hold for now||VIJAYAWADA: The proposed executive capital, Visakhapatnam, may have to wait for some more time before the shift becomes a reality. Though chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy had initially decided to start working from Visakhapatnam from May 6, sources close to him say that he has postponed the plan indefinitely due to court cases. The chief minister wanted to move out of Amaravati once the results of the Tirupati Lok Sabha constituency by-election are out on May 2. The ruling YSRC party’s victory in the panchayat and municipal elections had prompted the chief minister to take a call and move to Visakhapatnam. However, with the high court deciding to hear cases on the three capitals proposal from the beginning, the chief minister has chosen to wait instead. The Andhra Pradesh Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Act, 2020, passed in January 2020, aims to shift the executive capital to Vizag, the judicial capital to Kurnool, while retaining the legislative capital in Amaravati. The government had shelved the Amaravati capital project even before introducing the Act and had started work to relocate the executive capital to Visakhapatnam and judicial capital to Kurnool. However, the decision came under severe protest from the residents of the 29 villages in the capital region and which constitute Amaravati, and the opposition TDP that had planned the capital city in Amaravati. More than a dozen cases were filed in court and an agitation launched in Amaravati against the shifting of the executive and judiciary from Amaravati to Visakhapatnam and Kurnool, respectively. The high court had heard these cases but were kept aside as the then chief justice was transferred and a new chief justice took charge. The new chief justice has decided to hear all the cases from the start, thus forcing the chief minister to defer his decision to shift the capital. Sources say the chief minister will think of shifting the executive and the judicial capitals only after the court completes its hearing and delivers its judgement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/capital-status-for-vizag-may-be-on-hold-for-now/articleshow/82107329.cms||Gopi Dara

With this, Tata Sons, the holding company of the Tata Group, has exited the BPM business it founded in 2004. The exit is a result of it pruning its non-strategic portfolio. In November 2017, Tata Sons had sold 51% of Conneqt to Quess. Two years later, its stake in the Hyderabad-based company fell by 19% after it didn’t participate in an equity funding programme of Conneqt. On the other hand, Quess’s interest in Conneqt increased to 70% from 51%. Since Conneqt came into Quess’s fold, the BPM unit has expanded. Revenue grew to Rs 976 crore in fiscal 2020 from Rs 739 crore in fiscal 2018. Tata Sons has sold Conneqt shares for Rs 46.4 apiece to Quess pursuant the exercise of its put option. The transaction values Conneqt at nearly Rs 700 crore. Complete ownership over Conneqt will allow Quess to realise synergies between its BPM businesses better. Though Tata Sons has exited Conneqt, it continues to have an interest in BPM through TCS’s cognitive business operations (CBO). During the Q4 of fiscal 2021, the CBO won multiple first-time outsourcing deals, said TCS, in which Tata Sons owns over 70%. BPM, for the uninitiated, is the new avatar of BPO. It is the preferred acronym as BPO had acquired connotations of low-end call centre work, denting its public image. Also, the business model has changed with players offering a whole range of non-voice services including handling of high-end tasks. TCS’s CBO is a service line and not a separate business unit as it was in the past. In 2013, TCS had acquired Citi’s back-office operations for $505 million, which was the largest M&A in the sector. Conneqt, on the other hand, has emerged as the second-largest BPM player in the country with 21 delivery centres and employing over 29,000 people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tata-sons-exits-bpm-biz-offloads-conneqt-stake/articleshow/82108550.cms||Reeba Zachariah

On February 12, Tata Motors announced the appointment of Llistosella as its chief executive. But it said a month later that he will not be joining the Mumbai-based company. Tata Motors didn’t give any reason for the change in decision. Llistosella, a former Daimler veteran, according to the employment terms, was to join the Tata Group flagship formally on June 1. He had also attended virtual meetings to gain an understanding of its domestic business in the intervening period. While the damages paid by Tata Motors could not be ascertained, a labour lawyer said it is usually equivalent to the compensation an applicant would have earned during his contractual notice period. “Such issues are mostly amicably settled by the employer and the candidate,” he added. Tata Motors didn’t respond to TOI’s request for comment. An official of a board and CEO executive search firm said that even if an applicant has not joined his new employer, once a job offer has been made and accepted, a binding contract exists between them. “And if the employer subsequently rescinds the offer, it could amount to a breach of contract. The applicant can seek compensation for the employer’s failure to withdraw the contract in accordance with its terms,” the official explained. Employment contracts, especially those of C-suite expatriate hires, include a clause on liquidated damages. Had Llistosella withdrawn from the offer, Tata Motors could have claimed damages for breach of contract. The March 19 statement by Tata Motors didn’t mention whether it withdrew its offer or Llistosella backed out from the job. Expatriate recruitments from many countries such as the UK and those in the EU are protected by the labour laws of their regions, with liquidated damages forming part of the contracts. India has no such protective labour laws. If Llistosella would have taken charge of Tata Motors, he would have become the fourth expatriate to helm the company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/offer-withdrawal-tata-motors-pays-damages-to-ceo-designate/articleshow/82108601.cms||Reeba Zachariah

In another case, Beed police booked a pharmacy store operator for selling the injection for Rs 5,400. The arrested suspects were identified as Mandar Bhalerao (29) of Shivajinagar, pharmacist Abhijit Taur of Indira Medical Store in Sutgirni area and Anil Bahote, a class-IV employee of the civil hospital. Based on a complaint lodged by FDA inspector Rajgopal Bajaj, the Pundaliknagar police arrested the suspects on the charges of cheating and under different sections of Drugs and Cosmetics Act, Rules 2019 and Essential Commodities Act 1955. Assistant inspector Ghanshyam Sonawne told TOI that preliminary probe has revealed that the civil hospital staffer was posted at the Covid-19 ward for the last one year. He would smuggle out remdesivir injection and hand it over to the private pharmacist, who would sell it at an exorbitant price through a middleman.” In Beed district, police registered a case against an operator of Lifeline Medical store situated in a super-specialty hospital for selling remdisivir for Rs 5,400, after NCP corporator Amar Naikwade conducted a sting operation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/3-held-for-selling-drug-at-high-price/articleshow/82106438.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Sanjay Shankhyadhar, a city-based lawyer, whose brother Sanjeev Shankhyadhar had died after battling the disease for 15 days at the hospital, alleged that the hospital had denied the patient proper treatment. While hospital authorities dismissed the allegations of medical negligence, they admitted to the goof-up, saying it was an “inadvertent mistake” to hand over the wrong body. Talking to TOI, Shankhyadhar said, “My brother and his wife both tested positive for the coronavirus around two weeks ago. Initially my brother was doing well and did not need an ICU or ventilator. However, his condition later deteriorated and he had to be shifted to the ICU.” “When visiting him, I saw hospital staff dumping used PPE kits in bins placed right next to patients’ beds. Also, when we got to know that the hospital did not have an expert pulmonologist to treat my brother’s increasing respiratory distress, we requested the hospital to let us have an expert from outside visit him but we were refused. He finally died on Thursday but the agony didn’t end there. First we got the wrong body. Then we were denied a death receipt at the mortuary, as the staff said it had gone missing,” he added. The deceased’s son, Pratyush, told TOI, “Before the cremation, we were only allowed to see his eyes. It was when the body was uncovered for cremation that we realised it was not my father. When we confronted the ambulance driver, he told me I was unable to recognise the body as it had decomposed.” When the family insisted that the body on the pyre was that of a stranger’s, the hospital sent them a photo of the other body in the morgue and it turned out to be the right one. “After we protested, my father’s body was sent to the cremation ground by the hospital in another ambulance. All we got was an apology,” Pratyush added. Pawan Sharma, owner of Kailash Hospital, said that contrary to the family’s allegations, the patient had been given the best possible treatment and Dr Jagdish Rawat, a pulmonologist, had examined him. As for the body goof-up, Sharma said “it was an inadvertent error and we have apologised to the family”. “I personally travelled to the cremation ground to apologise for the mistake,” Sharma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/family-of-man-who-succumbed-to-covid-19-at-pvt-hospital-in-doon-discovers-they-had-been-given-the-wrong-body-during-cremation/articleshow/82107105.cms||Ishita Mishra

The number of positive cases of Covid-19 crossed 100 on Thursday. Many places in the Damoh constituency, people have put up banners of "pani nai toh vote nahi" in protest against water scarcity. People in many areas in the constituency, Damoh city and its neighbouring regions, have threatened to boycott the polling if water scarcity continues. Many regions of the district face water scarcity on a regular basis. Posters and banners with the message “ Pani nahi toh vote nahi” have come up. Ramesh Kushwah, a farmer growing vegetables near Damoh said, “this year's water crisis started in early March. Politicians and bureaucrats know about the scarcity”. He said that the elections were the right time to raise the issue. Ravi Jain, a trader, said, issues like water scarcity affect the business also. “Farmers need to have good harvest to make the market vibrant.” CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan had addressed as many as six meetings in Damoh and tried to address the issues of development including the availability of water. He has promised piped water in the constituency and also reminded them of Rs 700 crore sanctioned for drinking water project in the region. But in the run up to elections, people in Damoh were getting plenty of water. Water was being supplied not only by the local civic body but the BJP and Congress candidates were also vigil and ensuring supply by tankers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/anger-in-damoh-over-covid-surge-water-scarcity/articleshow/82108657.cms||---

Having seen the havoc wreaked in their lives by the pandemic last year, welfare activists are alarmed at the prospect of livelihoods being destroyed again. Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan (DRRAA) has petitioned chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to ensure the poor and marginalised are provided basic food security while coping with distress caused by commercial restrictions. Curbs on night movement, the closing of schools and colleges, bans on social, cultural and religious gatherings, shutting down of malls, gyms, spas and auditoriums, curbs on weekly markets and limited public transport carriage and restaurant seating are adversely impacting economic activity in Delhi. DRRAA volunteers have been speaking to people in low-income settlements and visiting bus terminals and train stations to document the impact of these restrictions on their livelihoods. The organisation’s letter to the CM mentioned that in the industrial zones of Bawana and Narela, there was intense distress among daily labourers after being told by their hirers that no wages would be given in case of a lockdown or stoppage of work. “Already, the imposition of night curfew has curbed the earnings of people working in night shifts. People working as domestic help have also reported a drop in earnings due to the pressure of employers to work exclusively in one house,” the letter noted. “Older people, men and women, have been the worst hit as most employers have asked them to stop coming for work fearing the spread of Covid. At labour chowks, daily wagers have not been able to find any work for the last several days. The biggest worry people are expressing is that this time they have no savings to fall back on for even basic needs like food, rent, etc. as whatever little they had saved, was exhausted in coping with the crisis last year.” The letter requested Delhi government to make free cooked meals and rations available to everyone in need. Last year, Delhi High Court, hearing DRRAA’s petition, had ordered provision of rations to all persons requiring food security irrespective of whether they possessed a ration card. Only 37% of Delhi’s population possesses ration cards. Those who don’t include a large percentage of the poor and marginalised, including migrant workers. “Ensure that all provisions under the National Food Security Act —Mid-Day Meal scheme, Integrated Child Development Services and hot cooked meal for pregnant and lactating women through anganwadis — continue without any disruption during this time of crisis,” DRRAA urged Kejriwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plea-to-save-migrants-daily-wagers-from-2020-re-run/articleshow/82108660.cms||Pankhuri Yadav
---||Chandigarh||‘Punjab power discom surrendered power worth Rs 4k cr’||Patiala: PSPCL surrendered unutilised power worth more than Rs 4,000 crore, the PSEB Engineers Association has claimed. The association has written a nine-page letter to the chairman-cum-managing director (CMD), stating: “The per unit cost from these IPPs has been increasing almost on yearly basis. Moreover, these IPPs are finding loopholes in the PPAs and have been indulging in litigation resulting in higher power cost to the consumers of the state. The overall impact of all such litigations will be around Rs 20,000 crore over the next remaining 20 years of the agreements.” “Keeping in view the interests of consumers of Punjab, long term exclusive PPAs with the IIPs should be immediately cancelled under clause 14.4.5 of the PPA and like other projects power should be procured only as per actual requirement of the corporation at market competitive rates from these IPPs,” it adds. The association has made a number 42 suggestions on reducing the cost of power, structural reforms, strengthening of the distribution system, and human resource management to the PSPCL management. “PSPCL has not been able to import more power at the time of shortage when there is maximum demand during paddy season due to 400 KV system constraints.” PSEBEA general secretary Ajay Pal Singh Atwal said PSPCL could save Rs 600 per ton on the coal cost if captive coal mine at Pachwara was made operational. “Urgent personnel attention is required to get the court case settled. There is an urgent need to bring down the tariff rates during night hours to utilise the maximum surplus power available. Power theft is increasing in police and district administration offices as they install an excess number of air-conditioners.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-power-discom-surrendered-power-worth-rs-4k-cr/articleshow/82109221.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Women voters hold key in five of seven urban local bodies polls||HYDERABAD: With women voters outnumbering male voters in five of the seven urban local bodies going to polls on April 30, political parties are going all out to woo women voters. They intensified their efforts after the poll notification was issued on Thursday. Urban women are likely to play a crucial role in deciding the electoral fortunes of candidates in Greater Warangal and Khammam municipal corporations and municipalities of Atchampet, Siddipet and Nakrekal. The TRS is claiming that no other party has doled out welfare schemes for women as its government has done. It quoted Aasara pensions for single women, old age women and widows, Kalyana Lakshmi and Shaadi Mubarak scheme. Congress, however, is blaming the TRS for weakening the self-help groups. It also said the Aasara pension scheme was its brainchild and that the TRS is only continuing the scheme with an enhanced amount. The BJP, on the other hand, is raising the slogan ‘beti bachao, beti padhao’ given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and listing out the central share of funds in every scheme being implemented by TRS government. Meanwhile, the State Election Commission has notified reservations to women, SCs, STs and BCs in seven urban local bodies. As much as 50% of the total seats are reserved for women as per the Municipal Act. State  commissioner C Partha Sarathi made it clear that the model code of conduct has come into force in the seven urban local bodies going to polls. He also clarified that though only one ward each is going to polls in nine other municipal bodies, including Greater Hyderabad, the election code would be applicable in the entire municipality and municipal corporation limits until the entire process of elections is over. Even transfer of officials without the permission of the SEC in municipalities and municipal corporations going to polls is not allowed and would be deemed as violation of the model code of conduct, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/women-voters-hold-key-in-5-of-7-ulb-polls/articleshow/82108672.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Ahmedabad||Home-based oxygen demand also shot up in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: Fifteen days ago there were few Covid patients in hospitals, but the number of patients now has shot up dramatically. “Suppose a small hospital had 10 beds a fortnight ago, the number of beds in that hospital has now gone up to 20. Hence, their requirement of medical oxygen has also gone up manifold,” said an oxygen manufacturer and re-filler. Oxygen suppliers also explained that several new hospitals, especially smaller ones, have been allowed to admit and treat Covid-19 patients. Such hospitals have also started demanding oxygen. The demand has also grown from those patients who are discharged from the hospitals, but they require oxygen at home. “Such patients also consume oxygen for about a week or so. The number this type of patients has also increased, which has subsequently contributed to the rise in demand,” said another re-filler of oxygen. “Local public is also procuring oxygen cylinders for use at home,” the re-filler added. The unprecedented surge in demand coupled with increase in labour and transportation cost has pushed up prices of medical oxygen to Rs 25-30 per cubic meter. The price was about Rs 17-22 per cubic meter before April. The oxygen re-fillers procure liquid oxygen from large corporate players, who have raised their rates from Rs 11.50 per cubic metre to Rs 16.50 per cubic metre, added industry players. A city-based manufacturer said that right from raw material to manpower, currently the industry is facing a crunch. “Almost all the major plants are working round the clock to beat the demand. But no system could be ready for the surge we are experiencing. It would also take some time for the industry to stabilize and sort the supply chain,” he said. Several of the hospitals have thus installed liquid oxygen tanks for which the supply is more stable and filling up time is slightly higher compared to the oxygen gas cylinders, said hospital sector experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/home-based-oxygen-demand-also-shot-up/articleshow/82108659.cms||Kalpesh Damor

Nitish said if the people of Bihar working in other states were willing to return, his government would welcome them. Another meeting with all the DMs is scheduled for Sunday, when an update on the ground situation will also be collected for carrying out follow-up steps in tune with the specific situation prevailing in the districts, the CM said, adding that the people should abide by the protocols like wearing of masks, washing hands with soap at regular intervals and maintaining social distance. While talking to reporters after a high-level review meeting convened to get an update on the Covid situation, the CM expressed concern and said the number of coronavirus cases had continued to show increasing trend every day. He said the officials concerned had been asked to speed up vaccination for protection against the virus that is more virulent in its second wave of the spread compared to last year. He directed the officials to take special precautionary steps in the areas from where the corona cases were being reported and take all necessary measures to check the virus spread. The CM asked the officials to maintain the availability of medicines and oxygen cylinders in sufficient quantity at the hospitals so that patients did not face problems in their treatment. He also said the Covid-dedicated hospitals should be provided with all necessary support, like the increased number of beds and oxygen cylinders. Earlier, health department principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit presented an update on daily tests and positive cases as well as the number of active cases, recovery rate and district-wise situation.

Reacting on the same, senior BJP leaders asked the Congress MLA not to do politics in the current scenario. “The situation in Indore is only getting worse. There is no availability of beds, injections and oxygen and in this, all the public representatives of BJP are ‘missing’ while I am working day and night to help saving lives” said Shukla in a joint press conference with former state minister Sajjan Singh Verma. He added that his son was hospitalized but he is completely engaged to help the needy patients but lack of support and partiality on part of BJP-led state government and local administration is posing hurdles in his drive. “I had offered a blank-cheque to the collector along with two hostels, run by my family, to convert into hospitals/CCC for treatment of Covid-19, who are failing to get admission in hospitals but to no avail as no administrative officials are picking up our phones while we (Rau MLA Jitu Patwari and Depalpur MLA Vishal Patel) are also not invited into the district crisis management committee’s meeting from last one year” he alleged. Shukla also alleged the administration for giving Remdesivir injections to BJP MLAs and MP, who are distributing it among their supporters only. “I can’t see people dying due to nonavailability of beds, oxygen and the lifesaving drugs” said Shukla as he burst into tears. He further warned the local administration and said, “If the situation will not get better in the next two days, I will set myself fire at Rajwada or at my home as lakhs of people are dying due to present scenarios”. Reacting on Shukla’s statements, the in-charge minister Tulsiram Silawat said that this is the time to serve humanity with coordination, instead of doing politics. “They (Congress) should not do politics in the present situation” he said. The cultural and tourism minister Usha Thakur said, “The administration is inviting all the public representatives in the district crisis management committee’s meeting and if not, we will examine it”. She added that one should serve the public silently and if it would be made a medium of publicity, it would be of no use. On Shukla’s allegations that BJP MLAs, MP are being provided Remdesivir injections to distribute it among their supporters, Thakur said, “It’s not true. If you give proof that any such person (BJP leaders) are involved in such things, he/she will be punished. In this situation, saving life is important and not the relations”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/will-set-myself-on-fire-if-situation-doesnt-get-better-in-next-two-days-cong-mla/articleshow/82112371.cms||---
---||Delhi||Sudden surge in Covid cases in Delhi leads to mad rush for plasma||NEW DELHI: “I am living a nightmare right now,” said an exasperated Ratish Nanda, a noted conservation architect. Since Monday, Nanda has been frantically searching for a plasma donor for a colleague and his wife and has only managed to find a donor for one of them. Convalescent plasma therapy is a procedure that is used to treat severe Covid-19 cases and plasma from those who have recovered from the disease and contain antibodies is introduced in the blood of recipients. Anyone who has recovered from Covid-19 can donate plasma two to three weeks after recovery and easily up to three months. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal recently urged those who have recently recovered from Covid-19 to donate plasma. “In the past few months, the dip in cases decreased both the demand and the number of plasma donations. Once again, the daily demand of plasma has increased,” he said. Nanda, who is the CEO of Aga Khan Trust for Culture, said that the search for plasma donors has left him and his other colleagues drained and frustrated. “I have had 11 donors rejected because they had high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid, etc. We must have called hundreds of people and posted on social media looking for donors,” he said, adding that there are many ‘lists’ of donors circulating on social media but most lead to a dead end. “Worse, some people are playing pranks and circulating contact numbers of people who have never had Covid-19,” he said. Nanda said that it was most frustrating when they find a willing donor, only to find they don’t have sufficient antibodies. “Even testing kits to check antigen in donors are difficult to find. It takes two days to know if the donor has antigens,” he said. Rida Sayyeda, a 23-year-old HR professional, has been searching for plasma for her 49-year-old uncle who is admitted in a severe condition in an ICU. “We have enrolled on all government portals, but it has been of no help. We visited a plasma bank but without a replacement donor, we can’t get plasma of his blood type,” she said. Sayyeda and her family have checked with every hospital in NCR and also called every phone number people shared on social media of possible donors. “We did everything we could and called all the numbers. A donor agreed over the phone to donate plasma but it turned out that he lives in Tamil Nadu,” she said, adding that many of the numbers being shared on social media don’t work. Prashant Saini, who created a website—www.needplasma.in—in June last year during the first wave of Covid-19 cases, has once again started receiving a large number of requests from people looking for plasma donors. Saini, however, said that due to dip in the cases in the last three months, the donors he is able to find have all recovered in December 2020 or earlier and wouldn’t have antibodies ‘strong’ enough for donation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sudden-surge-in-covid-cases-leads-to-mad-rush-for-plasma/articleshow/82108689.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Nagpur||Active patients in Vidarbha may touch 2.50 lakh by May: Experts||NAGPUR: The rate of Covid-19 spread and detection of new patients since January shows a four-fold increase in under-treatment patients every month. At this rate, there will be more than 2.50 lakh patients in Vidarbha by the end of April. Assuming 5% will require hospitalization, over 12,500 will be in hospitals. In some districts, even mild symptomatic patients are being kept in institutional quarantine to stop spread of infection. Thus, more than 25,000 patients will require hospital beds by May. Considering the present bed situation in Vidarbha, the future doesn’t look too good. Vidarbha has approximately 33,000 hospital beds at present in hospitals, Covid Care Centres (CCCs) and institutional quarantine venues and there are just over 1.17 lakh active patients. Less than 40% of these beds have oxygen facility attached. Ventilator count is even less. Already, most of the 11 Vidarbha districts are facing severe crunch of oxygen beds and running short of ventilators. It has become difficult to find even isolation beds in institutional centres. Take Chandrapur. There are total 1,020 beds in 11 CCCs in the district. Only 150 of them were available on April 15. Nine Dedicated Covid Hospitals in Chandrapur have 564 beds, but only four were vacant on April 15. In Wardha, as per the official dashboard, 90 out of total 1,000 beds were available. In Bhandara, 202 out of 1,533 were available, while in Gondia 553 of 1,667 were available. The picture in Amravati and Akola is improving. Despite having more than 4,000 active patients; Akola has 100+ beds vacant as number of serious patients is less. In Amravati, there are total 3,114 beds and about 40% of them are vacant now. However, Amravati has now started catering to patients from Nagpur and neighbouring states, so the number of available beds will reduce. Despite having a huge Covid care facility run by Gajanan Maharaj Sansthan of Shegaon, Buldhana district is running short of beds. The condition in Yavatmal is worse. “The number of under-treatment patients will surely go up. But, the pandemic never works on a mathematical model,” said epidemiologist Dr Anand Thatte. “We have imposed strict restrictions now. Even if 70% of them are followed, infection rate will go down in next two weeks. We may not reach 2.5 lakh mark,” he said. However, administration has started working on the mathematical projection. Bhandara, Gondia, Nagpur, Chandrapur districts are in mission mode to increase O2 beds. In Nagpur, guardian minister Nitin Raut started discussing the ‘Jumbo Covid Facility’ on Thursday. Experience is that jumbo facilities provide much respite as positive patients stop roaming around the city in search of beds which stops further spread.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/active-patients-in-vid-may-touch-2-50l-by-may-experts/articleshow/82108654.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

They are stepping out of their home before completing the quarantine period and are ending up infecting innumerable people coming in their contact.”As per the SOP, symptomatic patient discharged from the hospital and asymptomatic patients referred for home quarantine, are supposed to stay quarantined for 14 to 17 days. For the first 12 days, the heavy viral load makes them capable of infecting others. For the past few weeks, Aurangabad has been reporting over 1,000 cases daily and eventually burdening the overstretched health infrastructure. “It has come to fore that many patients, within five to seven days of home quarantine, are found stepping out of their homes and are becoming super spreaders,” Dr Yelikar said.Rueing over people blaming the health system and the administration for failing to tackle the current situation, she said the health staffers are not leaving any stone unturned to save lives. “Careless approach of some citizens along with baseless rumours against state health machinery is a deadly combination,” she said.GMCH deputy dean Kailash Zine said the lackadaisical attitude of some is adding to the current distress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/quarantine-violators-are-super-spreaders-aurangabad-hosp-dean/articleshow/82106454.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Bhopal||Will set self on fire if Covid crisis doesn’t improve: Congress MLA Sanjay Shukla||INDORE: Congress MLA Sanjay Shukla, who has been approaching Covid-19 patients and their relatives, on Friday burst into tears over scarcity of beds, oxygen and lifesaving drugs including Remdesivir injections and warned the administration to solve the shortage in next two days or he will set himself on fire. Reacting on the same, senior BJP leaders asked the Congress MLA not to do politics in the current scenario. “The situation in Indore is only getting worse. There is no availability of beds, injections and oxygen and in this, all the public representatives of BJP are ‘missing’ while I am working day and night to help saving lives” said Shukla in a joint press conference with former state minister Sajjan Singh Verma. He added that his son was hospitalized but he is completely engaged to help the needy patients but lack of support and partiality on part of BJP-led state government and local administration is posing hurdles in his drive. “I had offered a blank-cheque to the collector along with two hostels, run by my family, to convert into hospitals/CCC for treatment of Covid-19, who are failing to get admission in hospitals but to no avail as no administrative officials are picking up our phones while we (Rau MLA Jitu Patwari and Depalpur MLA Vishal Patel) are also not invited into the district crisis management committee’s meeting from last one year” he alleged. Shukla also alleged the administration for giving Remdesivir injections to BJP MLAs and MP, who are distributing it among their supporters only. “I can’t see people dying due to nonavailability of beds, oxygen and the lifesaving drugs” said Shukla as he burst into tears. He further warned the local administration and said, “If the situation will not get better in the next two days, I will set myself fire at Rajwada or at my home as lakhs of people are dying due to present scenarios”. Reacting on Shukla’s statements, the in-charge minister Tulsiram Silawat said that this is the time to serve humanity with coordination, instead of doing politics. “They (Congress) should not do politics in the present situation” he said. The cultural and tourism minister Usha Thakur said, “The administration is inviting all the public representatives in the district crisis management committee’s meeting and if not, we will examine it”. She added that one should serve the public silently and if it would be made a medium of publicity, it would be of no use. On Shukla’s allegations that BJP MLAs, MP are being provided Remdesivir injections to distribute it among their supporters, Thakur said, “It’s not true. If you give proof that any such person (BJP leaders) are involved in such things, he/she will be punished. In this situation, saving life is important and not the relations”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/will-set-myself-on-fire-if-situation-doesnt-get-better-in-next-two-days-cong-mla/articleshow/82108673.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Rajnath Covi-shield for city: DRDO to bolster health infra||Lucknow: The acute shortage of beds for Covid-19 patients is likely to ease soon with the defence ministry deciding to set up at least two makeshift hospitals in the city. Following instructions from Union defence minister and Lucknow MP Rajnath Singh, a team of DRDO officials is set to begin the process on a war footing. A team from Delhi left for Lucknow by road on Friday. Defence ministry sources told TOI that two makeshift hospitals, with capacity of around 250-300 beds each, will be established in Lucknow in the next 4-5 days. Officials, who did not wish to be named, said the hospitals were likely to come up at Haj House and Golden Blossom Resort on Faizabad Road. Haj House was used as a quarantine facility last year too. Officials said defence minister Rajnath Singh was personally looking into the situation in Lucknow and was in constant touch with chief minister Yogi Adityanath and other leaders. “The DRDO team will inspect a few sites. We want to set up the hospitals at the earliest, therefore, the team will identify the spots which suit their requirements. It can be a completely new venue or an existing hospital similar to what was done in Patna last year,” a DRDO official from Delhi said. The makeshift hospitals, set up by DRDO, will be run by doctors, nurses and support staff of the Armed Forces Medical Services. During the first Covid-19 wave last year, DRDO had set up a 1000-bed makeshift hospital in Delhi which was made fully functional in 12 days. Currently, a 500-bed makeshift hospital is being developed by DRDO near T1 domestic air terminal in Delhi. “We provided oxygen in all 1,000 beds in Delhi and 250 were equipped with ventilator support. The set up was centrally air-conditioned as per WHO protocol for air circulation for Covid-19 patients,” the DRDO official added. It is expected that hospitals in Lucknow will be set up on the lines of the one being put to ground in Delhi. Separate blocks for patients, doctors and accommodation for medical teams, an administrative block with a doctors’ room, catering area for visitors/attendants, a reception, a basic lab and pharmacy is being developed in Delhi’s hospital. The facility will also have security staff, closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance and access control systems. The hospital will be equipped with an integrated fire safety and control system. Environmental safety and waste disposal processes have also been included in the design of operations. A large parking area will also be designated for staff, public, ambulances and firefighting services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rajnath-covi-shield-for-city-drdo-to-bolster-health-infra/articleshow/82109122.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Nashik||Relief for Malegaon hospitals as Aurangabad firm offers O2 supply||Nashik: A private alloy steel firm from Aurangabad has stepped in to provide oxygen to Malegaon town, which is reeling under severe scarcity of the gas required for Covid-19 patients. Malegaon Municipal Corporation officials said that the firm had provided oxygen for refilling of 570 cylinders on Thursday and it will continue to provide the gas to refill about 400-500 jumbo cylinders on a daily basis. “The gesture by the private firm is huge. We have written a letter to the firm thanking it for agreeing to provide oxygen to Malegaon. We are working overtime to further enhance the supply of oxygen in Malegaon,” said Prakash Simpi, the MMC officer looking after the demand-supply of the gas in the town. The daily requirement of government and private hospitals in Malegaon is around 1,500 jumbo cylinders. The government hospitals are somehow managing their oxygen supply, the 36 private hospitals are facing acute crisis. Many of these hospitals have stopped admitting patients. MMC officials said that Nashik district collector Suraj Mandhare and Malegaon civic body are making efforts to further streamline the supply of the gas in the textile town. Mandhare had already directed civil surgeon Ashok Thorat to fast-track the process of establishing a liquid oxygen plant at Malegaon civil hospital. The immediate past president of Indian Medical Association, Malegaon, Dr Mayur Shah, said that the private hospitals alone need around 1,100 jumbo cylinders a day. “The government authorities have to ensure a steady supply of oxygen to the private hospitals, else these hospitals will not be able to render proper treatment to Covid patients,” added Dr Shah. A delegation of the doctors and oxygen distributors met MMC deputy commissioner Nitin Kapadnis and sought the civic body’s immediate intervention to resolve the oxygen scarcity problem. Kapadnis assured them that MMC has been working to resolve the issue as soon as possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/relief-for-malegaon-hospitals-as-aurangabad-firm-offers-o2-supply/articleshow/82106469.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Lucknow||Baikunth Dham to have 3 moregreenatoriums||Lucknow: After opening two greenatoriums at Baikunth Dham, Lucknow Municipal Corporation has started three more such machines at the same place. Two machines are also being installed at Gulala Ghat. According to LMC officials, the decision has been taken in view of the surge in deaths due to Covid and non-Covid diseases. The installation work has already started at both the cremation grounds and it will take about next four to five days to start the new facility. The decision has been taken to reduce the burden from traditional and electric crematorium installed at both sites, they said. The greenatorium is the option for people to go for a traditional way of performing last rites for their loved ones without damaging the air quality of the city as it will have characteristics of both electronic and traditional way of funeral. LMC officials said that the machine will have a cascade where the body will be kept along with wood and pyre. After performing last rituals, the pyre will be lit up and the chamber will be closed for burning the body. To stop toxic gas emitted by the burning of the body for getting contaminated with the atmosphere, the gas will be mixed with water to be turned into vapour before getting released to air through a chimney. It is also less time consuming as compared to the traditional way of cremation. In a press statement issued by municipal commissioner Ajay Dwivedi it was stated that the greenatorium will only take 150 kg of wood for performing a funeral as compared to traditional way funeral which requires around 350 kg of wood. The greenatorium will cost around Rs 300- Rs 500 as compared to the traditional way of wooden pyre which costs over Rs 4,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/baikunth-dham-to-have-3-moregreenatoriums/articleshow/82109028.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||Non-covid patients’ nightmare begins as hosps bear burden of surge||Lucknow: A chronic patient of respiratory disease, who had an asthma attack on Friday morning, died in the afternoon after her husband made distress calls to several non-Covid hospitals, but none had any oxygen support. Nirmala Tiwari (65) passed away as no doctor was ready to visit her home to ascertain her situation. Her husband, Kamlesh, a retired government officer, made futile attempts to arrange for oxygen support. Many like Nirmala have been left in the lurch due to conversion of most of the prominent multispeciality hospitals in the city into Covid facilities. People, particularly from low economic income groups, suffering from serious ailments are finding it difficult to seek medical help as Covid hospitals are either not taking non-Covid patients or have limited the intake. Private hospitals have also restricted the number of patients due to safety protocols. Shakti Nagar resident, Shashi Ojha’s 33-year-old son needs a kidney transplant, for which he had received money from the PM relief fund. “He has to undergo dialysis twice a week, which was disrupted last year during the first wave of the pandemic, when the SGPGIMS diverted most of its resources toward Covid care. After normal services resumed at the institute, we were hopeful that kidney transplant would be done, but the outbreak of the second wave has stalled things again. I cannot bear the cost of a kidney transplant in a private hospital,” she said. Talat Shahim (62), a Chowk resident, was unwell for the past 10 days after her diabetes deteriorated and she collapsed on Friday. “We made desperate calls, but hospitals and private doctors refused to entertain. While some had no vacancy, others lacked expertise. A few wanted us to come with a negative Covid test report. This wasted a lot of time,” said Talat’s son Mohammad Shahjar. Om Narayan Tripathi (42), a resident of Gomtinagar, suffering from severe Liver infection, said the multispeciality institutes like SGPGIMS, KGMU and RMLIMS have suspended OPDs and offering telemedicine, but my problem can be solved on telephone. Shashi Narain (80), a retired teacher, was forced to spend a fortune from his pension fund for dialysis in a private hospital as options in the government hospitals had been limited. Indiranagar resident Manish Srivastava (40) had a high fever and went to several private clinics but all refused to treat him, asking him to produce a negative Covid test report. Prem Prakash (45) had to undergo a gallbladder surgery urgently because of the acute pain. “The charges in private hospitals were 40,000-50,000 in comparison to just 3000-5000 in KGMU,” he said. Sunidhi Srivastava’s whose son has a neurological problem said, “We went to several private hospitals, but none could diagnose and asked us to go to either SGPGIMS or KGMU.” “I understand that Covid patients should get priority in this unprecedented situation, but officials must ensure non-Covid patients also get affordable health care,” said Harshit Chaudhary, who has been running from pillar to post for the past one week to get treatment for oral cancer. Dheeraj Singh, who was bitten by a dog on Wednesday was told by the doctor to produce a negative Covid report, when he went to get the anti-rabies vaccine shot.

---||Lucknow||Food packets for Covid patients a warm gesture||Lucknow: Twenty-four-year-old Venuka Sehgal, who runs a cloud-kitchen at her home in Jankipuram, recently decided to bring a change in her cooking routine. Instead of baking breads and delivering it to her customers across the city, the entrepreneur is busy making home-cooked meals for Covid affected patients who are in home isolation. Like her, some residents and tiffin providers have taken up the initiative to provide healthy home-cooked meals to home-isolated or asymptomatic patients to ease the burden of those who are living alone or who do not want to spread the infection to their family members and kids. “For now, I am focussed on providing quality food to the patients and not looking for profits. Given the current situation we have put on hold our regular breads and menu deliveries. The food that the customer orders consists of dal, vegetable, chapatis, rice and salad, all cooked by me and my mother. The food is packed in disposable plates and boxes and delivered through us. We take all the precautions of wearing mask, gloves, and sanitisers. Before delivering, we call the customer and put the package outside their homes,” said Venuka. The food package costs Rs 100 per person. She delivers only vegetarian meals in Jankipuram, Aliganj, Vikasnagar and Mahanagar. Running a cloud kitchen from Balaganj, Rahul Jain (30), is still recovering from the blow the pandemic dealt to his business. However, instead of putting a stop to his venture, he and his family have begun supplying meals to those quarantined at home. Providing vegetarian meals three times a day, Rahul, his wife and mother cook the food, while one staff member delivers it in different areas of the city. “In the past two weeks we have delivered about 1,000 thalis. One thali costs Rs 60 in which we provide 3-course meal consisting of soup, main meal, and salad. The food is delivered in disposable utensils in every area by a staff member of ours who follows all Covid protocols. Our kitchen is sanitized regularly before preparing meals for our customers,” said Jain who has been running the business since 2019. Another tiffin service provider, Amita Vishwakarma, has been delivering food from her home in Indiranagar. Apart from meeting the needs of Covid-19 patients, Amita also prepares the tiffin boxes for the patients’ families at an affordable rate of Rs 80. “We are working full capacity and supplying 30-35 meals per day. The number of cases has been rising rapidly and it is a difficult time for the people experiencing it, especially the patients and their families. I stay in touch with the patients and meet their food choices. Our staff members deliver freshly prepared meals and it’s a no contact service,” said Amita.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/food-packets-for-covid-patients-a-warm-gesture/articleshow/82109042.cms||Aditi Singh
---||Lucknow||Govt ropes in SHGs to makemasks, sanitizers, PPE kits||Lucknow: The steep surge in Covid-19 cases in the state has stirred the UP government to rope in self-help groups (SHGs), essentially run by women, for mass production of face masks, sanitizers and personal protection equipment (PPE) kits. According to the data of the rural development department, as many as 20,416 members of SHGs spanning across 75 districts of the state have managed to manufacture 1.23 crore face masks since April 1 when the Covid cases started to rise alarmingly. Data show that the maximum number of 8.67 lakh masks were manufactured by SHGs in Lucknow, followed by 6.8 lakh in Ambedkarnagar and 5.6 lakh in Rampur. Likewise, more than 14,000 litres of sanitizer has been manufactured by SHGs, mainly in districts like Muzzaffarnagar, Aligarh, Banda, Deoria, Barabanki, Basti, Etawah, Firozabad, Ghaziabad, Jalaun, Jhansi, Lucknow and Mainpuri. The SHGs have also managed to manufacture as many as 50,714 PPE kits within a fortnight, officials in the rural development department said. Data show that the SHGs have roped in production of hand wash. In the last fortnight, around 1,380 litres of hand wash has been manufactured by 251 members of the SHGs. Mission director, UP state rural livelihood mission (UPSRLM), Sujit Kumar said that the department pitched in soon after the number of corona cases began to rise. “We will be engaging maximum possible SHGs to manufacture face masks, sanitizers and PPE kits to meet the requirement in the prevailing crisis,” he said, adding that the products made by the SHGs would be made available at relatively cheaper rates. SHGs, in fact, this time appear heading to perform better than during the first wave. Data show that in April and May last year, the SHGs manufactured 62 lakh face masks, 36,300 PPE kits and 9,634 litres of sanitizers for being supplied in the local market. This was also the time when scores of migrants had returned to the state after the Centre imposed Corona induced lockdown. Officials said that many of the migrants were adjusted in the SHGs which were engaged in different works, including manufacture of school uniforms. Rural development department said that the engagement of SHGs will not only help the state government in tide over the prevailing Covid crisis but will also help in generating employment opportunities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-ropes-in-shgs-to-makemasks-sanitizers-ppe-kits/articleshow/82109092.cms||Pankaj Shah

To recall, Saifai Block head seat was initially declared reserved under SC (women) category, but the State Election Commission had recently announced fresh delimitation of the block and declared it reserved under OBC category. Saifai Block, which was constituted in 1994, always had a pramukh who was a member or closely associated with the Yadav clan. The 55 BDC members from the Saifai panchayat elect a block chief and out of those 55 all are often BDC members of the Samajwadi Party. For the first time, Ranveer Singh, son of Mulayam’s eldest brother Ratan Singh, was elected as the head of Saifai block. Ranveer, was elected as the block head of Saifai in 2000 again. However, after his sudden demise in 2002, the responsibility of the block head of Saifai in 2003 was given to Dharmendra Yadav, son of Mulayam’s younger brother Abhayram Yadav. Dharmenra vacated the seat a year later when he was elected as MP from Mainpuri in the 2004 Lok Sabha byelections as Mulayam vacated the seat after becoming the chief minister in 2003. Thereafter, Mulayam’s close confidante Nathu Singh’s nephew Arvind Yadav remained as the block head till the responsibility was passed on to Ranvir’s son and Mulayam’s grandson Tej Pratap who became the block pramukh in 2011. He, however, vacated the seat in 2014 after he was elected from the Mainpuri Lok Sabha seat. Thereafter, Tej Pratap’s mother Mridula Yadav took over at the new pramukh of Saifai block.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/msys-daughter-in-law-electedunopposed-as-saifai-bdc-member/articleshow/82108800.cms||---

Lucknow MP and Union defence minister Rajnath Singh has pitched in to stem the crisis in his constituency and directed Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) to help set up the facility. The Defence Expo-2020 site at Vrindavan Yojana next to Shaheed Path, has been identified for this project. With DRDO teams ready to hit the ground running from Saturday morning, the government swiftly acquired the Haj House on Kanpur Road and Golden Blossom Resort on Faizabad Road to convert them into makeshift Covid hospitals with the defence agency’s help. Rajnath Singh’s representative in Lucknow, Diwakar Tripathi, said, with DRDO’s efforts, another 1,500-2,000 beds will be available in Lucknow with setting up of at least three temporary hospitals. “The defence minister is keeping a close watch on the situation and he suggested that halls be acquired to convert them into temporary Covid facilities. He promised that medicines and doctors for new facilities would be arranged through DRDO and Army Medical Corps. The Army Central Command was also being contacted to provide health services,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/drdo-joins-covid-battle-city-to-get-3-hosps-with-2000-beds/articleshow/82109112.cms||Neha Lalchandani

With this, the hourly average rose to 1144.7 which is over 22 times higher than what it was a fortnight ago. On March 31, the hourly average was 51.25 and the total number of cases reported that day was 1,230. The havoc of the second wave took UP’s official tally to 7.93 lakhs and the number of active cases to 150,676. The numbers while on one hand explain the magnanimity of the problem; they also speak of the immense pressure on the health system. Additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said that about 79,000 of the active cases were in home isolation while others were undergoing treatment at a government or private facility. A look at the bulletin revealed that Lucknow alone accounted for 24% of the new cases. Varanasi (2,344), Prayagraj (1,758), Kanpur Nagar (1,403) and Gorakhpur (846) were the other big contributors accounting for 23.1% cases. In this way, 47% of the cases were reported from just five cities. Spikes were recorded left, right and centre in the state. In Bundelkhand, Jhansi saw 653 cases, Ghaziabad (595), Meerut (581), Gautam Budh Nagar (497) recorded a surge in the west. Likewise, Sonbhadra (477) represented the east. The pandemic virus took the toll of more than 100 persons for the second consecutive day. Lucknow, where 35 deaths were recorded, saw loss of three lives almost every three hours. Kanpur (7), Balia (5) and Varanasi (5) were the other big contributors. The total casualties so far reached 9,583. The recovery remained way slower than the speed with which new cases are being reported. Just 6,429 persons defeated the infection in the past 24 hours. However, the total number of persons recovered reached 6,33,461. ACS Prasad urged people to stay indoors and not venture into congregations as one may not be aware of his/ her disease status. “A good number of people are asymptomatic and may not be aware of their disease situation. As a result of this ignorance, they may inadvertently pass on the infection to someone else,” he said adding that restrictions have been imposed by the government on congregations because of this reason. “In addition to this, the government has suspended swasthya melas, which are held every Sunday, till at least May 16,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/over-1k-cases-every-hr-inup-push-covid-tally-to-7-9l/articleshow/82111588.cms||Shailvee Sharda

With this, the hourly average rose to 1144.7 which is over 22 times higher than what it was a fortnight ago. On March 31, the hourly average was 51.25 and the total number of cases reported that day was 1,230. The havoc of the second wave took UP’s official tally to 7.93 lakhs and the number of active cases to 150,676. The numbers while on one hand explain the magnanimity of the problem; they also speak of the immense pressure on the health system. Additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said that about 79,000 of the active cases were in home isolation while others were undergoing treatment at a government or private facility. A look at the bulletin revealed that Lucknow alone accounted for 24% of the new cases. Varanasi (2,344), Prayagraj (1,758), Kanpur Nagar (1,403) and Gorakhpur (846) were the other big contributors accounting for 23.1% cases. In this way, 47% of the cases were reported from just five cities. Spikes were recorded left, right and centre in the state. In Bundelkhand, Jhansi saw 653 cases, Ghaziabad (595), Meerut (581), Gautam Budh Nagar (497) recorded a surge in the west. Likewise, Sonbhadra (477) represented the east. The pandemic virus took the toll of more than 100 persons for the second consecutive day. Lucknow, where 35 deaths were recorded, saw loss of three lives almost every three hours. Kanpur (7), Balia (5) and Varanasi (5) were the other big contributors. The total casualties so far reached 9,583. The recovery remained way slower than the speed with which new cases are being reported. Just 6,429 persons defeated the infection in the past 24 hours. However, the total number of persons recovered reached 6,33,461. ACS Prasad urged people to stay indoors and not venture into congregations as one may not be aware of his/ her disease status. “A good number of people are asymptomatic and may not be aware of their disease situation. As a result of this ignorance, they may inadvertently pass on the infection to someone else,” he said adding that restrictions have been imposed by the government on congregations because of this reason. “In addition to this, the government has suspended swasthya melas, which are held every Sunday, till at least May 16,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/over-1k-cases-every-hr-inup-push-covid-tally-to-7-9l/articleshow/82109101.cms||Shailvee Sharda

You may land in institutional quarantine centre for 14 days straight from ‘antigen nakabandi’ points where a rapid antigen test (RAT) Covid test would be done by joint teams of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation and police, from Saturday. The NMC has also decided to clamp down on essential shops by using a mix of restricted timings along with odd-even shop opening formula. The city police and NMC will joins hands on Friday to catch the violators by surprise. Five teams have been formed and they would catch loiterers and conduct their RAT. If found positive, NMC or police vehicle would directly take them to an institutional quarantine facility. Commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar and civic chief Radhakrishnan B decided to crack down on the violators to curb the Covid spread. In an order issued on Friday, Radhakrishnan mentions that crowding is happening at market places where people are shopping for essentials. “To control this, operations of these shops need to be regulated,” he said. NMC has identified five commercial areas where stricter norms of operation shall be followed. Till further orders, some commercial areas under Satranjipura (zone 7), Dhantoli (zone 4), Dharampeth (zone 2), Asi Nagar (zone 9) and Mangalwari (zone 10) would function as per odd-even formula. Under Satranjipura zone, all essential shops (except medicals) from Golibar Chowk to Marwari Chowk, from Old Motor Stand Chowk to Ganjakhet Chowk have been marked for implementation of this formula. Shops facing North and East shall function on even dates, while those facing South and West shall function on odd dates. Under Dhantoli zone, vegetable wholesalers shall function from 4am till 8am. Those shops under ‘potato-onion line’ will open from 9am till noon. While both these category shops will be open everyday, it will be vendors who have to follow the odd-even formula. All other essential shops shall operate daily from 9am till 7pm. A complex and detailed list, segregated by the name of the vendor licence holder, has been provided to stakeholders. This will ensure that customers get access to the essential items, but not every shop selling the same remains open on the same day. Under Dharampeth zone, shops from Ram Nagar Chowk to Laxmi Bhuvan Chowk to Traffic Park Square and Gokulpeth Market will be covered for this order’s implementation. Shops facing North and East shall function on even dates, while those facing South and West shall function on odd dates.

Acting swiftly on the complaint of victim Mehakpreet’s mother Amandeep Kaur, Amir Khas police nabbed the accused, identified as Sukhpreet Kaur, who claimed to have confessed the crime. In her complaint to the police, Amandeep claimed that she had gone to the bank for some urgent work and left her 3-month-old girl at the neighbor’s house. “Taking advantage of my absence, Sukhpreet, who is the wife of my husband’s younger brother, sent my son to fetch the girl from the neighboring house and reportedly buried her alive in the septic tank of the toilet,” she alleged.  “On my return, we all started searching for the baby, but could not find her,” she said adding that Friday morning Sukhpreet came and told us that she has spotted the legs of the baby in the septic pond. The family got suspicious as the body of the baby was not seen in the pond during their search on the first day and then how she spotted the body of the baby in the pond the next day. Inspector Balveer Singh, station house officer, Amir Khas police station, said the accused has been arrested and she has admitted to the crime. In her confession, Sukhpreet said she wanted to take revenge from Amandeep over a domestic dispute between the two. “A case under section 302 IPC has been registered against Sukhpreet Kaur, and further investigations in the case are already on,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/in-fazilka-3-month-old-girl-buried-alive-by-aunt/articleshow/82109250.cms||Dinesh K Sharma

Cities joining the ‘Race to Zero’ campaign ahead of the (COP26) in Glasgow, United Kingdom will seek to prevent future climate threats, create jobs, and unlock equitable, sustainable growth. These cities must publicly acknowledge and recognise the global climate emergency, keeping climate resilience in line with urban decision making, pledging to reach net zero in the 2040s or sooner. They will also be identifying priority actions over the next decade. Speaking at an interaction with Climate Voices - a collective of three organisations Purpose, Asar and Climate Trends, Thackeray said, “It is unavoidable and urgent. We need to make the language simple, take it to the common man, and make it a part of mainstream politics. It also needs to be part of every level of governance, legislation, judiciary, and corporate structure.” Thackeray added that Mumbai’s draft climate action plan as part of the state’s Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the C40 Climate Leadership Group will be ready by August 2021.  Similarly as announced in December 2020, the state will make an investment of Rs. 1 lakh crore by 2025 and intends to generate non-conventional energy such as solar, wind, hydroelectric, waste-to-energy, and new technology-based among others, to the tune of 17,385 megawatts and an Electric Vehicles (EV) Policy, approved in early 2018, which will come into effect soon. “The drive for reduction in carbon footprint has begun with Majhi Vasundhara (climate change department's initiative) and I was pleasantly surprised to see a lot of towns also participate with eagerness and the awareness about climate change,” he told TOI||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-city-among-5-others-to-join-race-to-zero-drive-run-by-cop26/articleshow/82109269.cms||Vinamrata Borwankar

In such a situation, philanthropic organisations are stepping in to provide respite with free oxygen cylinders.

We couldn’t afford to get another cylinder, so decided to come to the hospital,” said Panda. “But my husband is being denied admission and is sitting in the ambulance.” At the same hospital, Hartendra Singh spoke grimly. “We had no oxygen at home so we went to various private and government hospitals, but all in vain,” he narrated. “Finally, we reached here at 1am, but after a few hours of oxygen, my brother was asked to stand outside the emergency ward, where he is now.” Many people complained that oxygen distributors had either stopped responding to phone calls from customers. An oxygen supplier in south Delhi told TOI, “Most of us are under pressure. The demand has shot up in the past one week and we do not have enough oxygen cylinders. Many people do not return the cylinders to us after use. If they did, we could refill them for their use.” This is what Karan Wadhwa did. Four members of his family are Covid-positive, including Wadhwa himself and his father. “We were about to get my father vaccinated when he exhibited infection symptoms. Then his oxygen levels started going down, and we began a search for cylinders,” said Wadhwa. “But the suppliers were asking us up to Rs 20,000. Thankfully, a friend had a spare cylinder and we got it refilled for much lesser.” This situation has prompted organisations like Hemkunt Foundation to intervene and provide oxygen cylinders to people after a nominal security deposit. “We started this initiative during the lockdown last year and distributed over 200 cylinders in Mumbai,” said Harteerath Singh, community development director. “We directly procure the cylinders from suppliers.” The organisation has distributed 80 cylinders in Delhi so far. East Delhi member of Parliament Gautam Gambhir had also tweeted on Saturday that he had arranged some oxygen cylinders for nursing homes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lack-of-oxygen-cylinders-increases-hospital-load/articleshow/82122389.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

---||Hyderabad||Siddipet sets stage for TRS-BJP electoral battle||Hyderabad: Siddipet is one of the smallest municipalities in the state with just one lakh voters. It may be a small civic body, but a lot is at stake for both the TRS and BJP which are keen to win the seat in the upcoming civic polls. Siddipet MLA and finance minister T Harish Rao and Dubbak BJP MLA M Raghunandan Rao, who are again leading the campaign for their respective parties, have a point or two to prove. The contest has become all the more important as chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s Gajwel constituency falls in Siddipet district, while the district headquarters constituency is represented by Harish Rao himself. The election assumes much importance after the BJP scored a surprise win Dubbak assembly seat in the byelection held in November last year. Dubbak also comes under Siddipet district. Elections to Siddipet municipality will be held along with other corporations and municipalities on April 30 and result will be announced on May 3. In the previous municipal election, of 34 wards (now raised to 43 wards), the BJP and Congress won two wards each and the AIMIM won one seat and the TRS and independents bagged the rest. Much before announcement of the election schedule, Harish Rao was busy focusing on strengthening local leadership and luring key leaders from other parties. His efforts bore fruit when Siddipet district TDP president Gundu Bhupesh jumped into the TRS. The minister also released a ‘development report’ of Siddipet town on Thursday along with another minister Koppula Eshwar. KCR himself launched some developmental works in the town recently. With Dubbak in its kitty, the BJP thinks it can spring a surprise in Siddipet also and teach KCR and Harish Rao a lesson on their home turf. Raghunandan Rao, who has been camping in Siddipet and working out strategies to win the election, is pretty confident. “We are getting an overwhelming response from the people in Siddipet municipality. People are disillusioned with the seven year misrule of the TRS government and are waiting for an opportunity to teach a lesson to the ruling party,” Raghunanandan Rao told TOI. TRS leaders, however, are hopeful that the party would sweep the entire council in the election. “The TRS government has developed Siddipet town by spending Rs 100 crore on infrastructure and other developmental works. Harish Rao has personally supervised developmental works on a daytoday basis,” a senior TRS leader said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/siddipet-sets-stage-for-trs-bjp-electoral-battle/articleshow/82108703.cms||Koride Mahesh

Dr S K Sarin, its director, told TOI that he planned to allow anyone who had recovered from Covid-19 in the past three to six months to donate convalescent plasma. “Current guidelines allow only people who have recovered in the last three months to donate,” Dr Sarin said. But “data has emerged that a proportion of patients after Covid-19 continues to have high levels of protective antibodies. Therefore, people who got infected in the last three to six months can come and donate, and if their antibody levels are high, their plasma can be utilised,” he added. Read our coronavirus live blog for all the latest news and updates  ILBS is issuing about 40 to 50 units of plasma daily but the doctors say demand is higher. “Plasma is not the primary therapy for Covid-19 patients. It should be used in conjunction with standard protocol drugs for treating the infection. Also, not everyone is a candidate for the therapy. A person who is already on ventilator or has multiorgan failure will not benefit from it,” Dr Sarin said.

A day before, Ahmedabad had become the 10thdistrict in India to have over 2,500 deaths. Analysis of the mortality trend in major cities revealed that Ahmedabad had case fatality rate (CFR) of 2.7% —Plasma therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from Covid-19 and transfusing it into a novel coronavirus-infected patient to help kick-start his immune system. There have been multiple studies to assess its efficacy in reducing morbidity and mortality risk in Covid-19 patients, but the jury is still out.

Plasma therapy is safe and has shown to improve recovery in select patients, said Dr Meenu Bajpai, professor of transfusion medicine and in-charge of Delhi Plasma Bank at ILBS. “It can be given to patients with early in the disease course, meaning prior to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilator,” she said. The latest guidelines issued by US FDA also states that the use of Covid-19 convalescent plasma with high titer antibody may be effective in treating hospitalised patients when administered early or when administered to patients with impaired humoral immunity. Dr Arun Gupta, president of Delhi Medical Council, said many hospitals were irrationally prescribing the therapy to all patients, often under pressure from the families or due to lack of understanding of the appropriate use. “Due to this, those who genuinely need it aren’t getting it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/not-all-covid-patients-need-plasma-therapy-say-doctors-amid-shortage/articleshow/82108706.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

MP’s Covid numbers reached a new high of 11,045 on Friday even as there was a glimmer of hope in the positivity rate dropping in at least four districts. The positivity rate has fallen to 4.6% in Khandwa, 4.9% in Burhanpur, 6.9% in Dewas and 9.7% in Chhindwara, which was much higher earlier, said CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Friday. MP’s overall positivity rate is a worrying 18.6%, and on Friday, it stood at 22.1%. With cases rising rapidly, ‘Corona curfew’ was clamped on Shivpuri and Singrauli districts as well —27 districts are under lockdown now. The government has decided to intensify testing and isolation of those returning from Kumbh and migrant workers who are coming back to their villages from other states. Friday was the second back-to-back day of the highest new infections and most deaths — 60. All 52 districts reported new cases in double digits. There are 59,183 active cases in the state — 68% of them in home isolation. The government is trying to arrange for enough oxygen, Remdesivir and CT scan machines to tackle this avalanche of cases. CM Chouhan spoke with Union minister Sadanand Gowda to ensure adequate supply. “Availability of oxygen is fast becoming normal. On April 8, 130 metric tonnes of oxygen was available in the state, which has now increased to 336 MT and by April 25, it will reach 565 MT,” Chouhan said. Tankers are being arranged to bring oxygen from Bhilai, Bokaro, Rourkela and Jamshedpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-covid-count-past-11k-but-positivity-dips-in-four-dists/articleshow/82108695.cms||---

The Jana Sena president in a letter to the Election Commission had explained that due to their alliance with the BJP, they withdrew from the GHMC election contest to avoid split of votes. Now, the party has decided to contest Greater Warangal and Khammam municipal corporation elections. The Jana Sena chief has urged the Election Commission to continue the party’s common symbol. However, the Election Commission, which considered the representation of Jana Sena, said it did not find its explanation satisfactory as the defence given by the Jana Sena was in violation of the Symbols Order, 2018. As a result, Jana Sena has lost its common symbol glass tumbler and forfeited its deposit amount. It can apply for a common symbol for local bodies polls up to five years i.e. November 18, 2025. Four other parties allotted common symbols in GHMC elections also lost their common symbols. They include India Praja Bandhu party (trumpet), Hindustan Janata Party (coconut farm), Marxist Communist Party of India (gas cylinder) and Indian Praja Congress (whistle), as all these parties failed to contest 10 per cent of the total 150 wards in GHMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/election-commission-strips-jana-sena-of-tumbler-symbol/articleshow/82108709.cms||Roushan Ali

The plea by a doctor urged the court to allow the application and restrain illegal online health service aggregators, which were not authorised to collect diagnostic samples for Covid-19 tests, from further committing contempt of the court order passed last year. Justice Najmi Waziri asked Delhi government to file a reply to the application and listed the matter for hearing on April 30. The plea said it was a matter of great concern that the second wave of Covid-19 was already on the rise, breaking all the previous records, and the brisk business of the online aggregators collecting and testing samples was also mushrooming. The plea claimed that rampant illegal sample collection by online health service aggregators was leading to false negative results, letting loose Covid-positive patients in the society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-seeks-govts-response-on-online-aggregators-collecting-test-samples/articleshow/82108722.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The centres, in the district, also faced a shortage of vaccines, however, by Friday afternoon few quantities of vaccines were made available. A maximum of 500 doses arrived at Seva Hospital located at Kasba Bawda of Kolhapur city, the hospital run by district administration. Umesh Kadam, the dean of Seva Hospital, said 500 was the highest number of vaccination done in a single day and the stock ended due to large turnout. The centre at the hospital witnessed beneficiaries mainly from Kolhapur city. The beneficiaries, who could not get the jab, were asked to come tomorrow or the day after as the hospital administration is expecting the availability of more doses by then. In centres run by KMC, the citizens were seen getting into an argument with staff. The KMC authorities said they had already declared that most vaccination centres will remain shut while the centres at the private hospitals will remain operational. Amol Mane, a vaccine coordinator of KMC, said in the last couple of hours, around 1,600 beneficiaries were vaccinated after some doses were made available. On Saturday, the KMC is planning to provide Covishield and Covaxin doses at different centres. The citizens, who have got their first dose of Covaxin, will have to wait for some time for the second dose. Those who need a second dose of Covishield, will have to approach only the specified centres on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/vaccination-halted-at-kmc-run-centres/articleshow/82106499.cms||---

Both the hospitals were also found violating the directives of the municipal commissioner about displaying the boards containing information related to the Covid treatment rates and the availability of the beds at the entrance. The charges of the non-ICU room are Rs 4,000 each per day, while the ICU bed is Rs 7,000 as per the government guidelines.“But these two hospitals were charging Rs 7,000 per room instead of Rs 4,000. Apart from that, there were also other violations like not displaying the rate chart for Covid treatment,” said Sonkamble.“Hence, taking serious cognizance of this, we have served show-cause to these two private hospitals, seeking clarification within three days,” he said. Around three-four weeks ago, there were 85 private Covid hospitals in the city, but it has been increased to over 140 hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/2-pvt-hospitals-in-nashik-city-get-notice-for-overcharging/articleshow/82106540.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Nagpur||Include frontline forest staff in vaccination priority list: CCF||NAGPUR: With the second Covid-19 wave hitting forest department frontline staff hard, the Pench Tiger Reserve has written to the divisional commissioner and district administration to include forest staff, which is protecting forest and wildlife, in the list of work which requires essential staff. Even while announcing lockdown restrictions on April 13, all operations related to forestry as declared by the forest department have been added in essential services. These activities include forest produce collection, processing, transport, wildlife conservation, and protection and allied activities and mitigation of man-animal conflict. Although the state government recognizes these activities as essentials, the frontline staff involved in these activities is not on the priority list like frontline workers for Covid-19 vaccination. There is no data available with the department how many forest staff has been vaccinated. As of now, healthcare and frontline workers are part of the priority list and are allowed vaccination regardless of age but foresters are not included in it. The government has also allowed vaccination of everyone above 45 years of age as the second Covid-19 wave has gripped the country. However, most of the field staff is below 45 years. Ravikiran Govekar, the chief conservator of forests (CCF) & field director, Pench, said, “Frontline staff in Umred-Karhandla, Mansinghdeo, Bor Tiger Reserve and Pench is working 24x7 for wildlife and forest protection. This is fire season and the staff has to monitor waterholes and work to keep a tab on poaching activities, illegal fishing, besides handling human-animal conflict.” “In the second Covid wave many staff have turned positive and the trend is increasing every day affecting various protection works. Forest staff is also part of the uniform service and hence forest service is also like emergency service,” said Govekar in a letter written to the divisional commissioner, district collectors and civil surgeons of Wardha and Nagpur. Govekar has urged the administration to include forest staff in the vaccination drive initiated by the state government. As of now the percentage of those vaccinated is less. “I’ve also written to the PCCF to include foresters in the vaccination list,” he added. With Covid-19 situation going out of control in the entire district, the forest department is no exception to spurt in Covid cases. “Though closure of tourism is not a big issue, how to save our young staff, who is turning positive, is the major issue before us. Hence, there is a need to vaccinate the staff who is below 45 years,” said Govekar. “This will go a long way in assuring our field staff about their safety and their families and will boost their morale in continuing to provide their best services to the protection of precious forest and wildlife,” said Govekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/include-frontline-forest-staff-in-vaccination-priority-list-ccf/articleshow/82108718.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Delhi||Almost no empty bed, people wait helplessly||New Delhi: Three days ago, a viral video showed a woman wailing after losing her father, for whom she had run from pillar to post trying to get a hospital bed. Twitter had another post on Saturday of a desperate wife sobbing besides her unresponsive husband, who is struggling for life in an ambulance outside Lok Nayak Hospital waiting for a bed. At Lok Nayak Hospital, when his oxygen saturation dropped to 78, a patient arranged his own gas cylinder and sat outside the hospital, hoping to be allotted a bed. The shortage of hospital beds and ICU facilities has traumatised people with Covid patients, particularly those who do not have the connections to manage a bed or cannot solicit help from social media platforms. Bharat Hakim is one of these unfortunate people. For three days, he has been trying to get an ICU bed for his 82-year-old, Covid-positive father, but was rebuffed by every hospital he approached. “They said that they had a lengthy waiting list and could not provide an ICU bed. I am stressed out because I have tried every big hospital, private and government, but all have denied us a bed. All this while, my father’s oxygen level has been dropping,” he mumbled. Another man, who recently lost a relative to Covid, tried the entire of Friday and was unable to find a bed for his Covid-infected father. It was only when an acquaintance with connections intervened that he got one for his patient. “I kept making calls all day, all night, but nothing worked. Finally, I recalled knowing someone who could be of help. He used his connections to get us a bed,” the man said. Doctors plead that the hospitals are overbooked and there is a long waiting list. “What can we do? There’s a massive bed crunch,” said Dr Kanika. “Yes, we feel terrible seeing so many deaths every day and people crying to get admission, but we are helpless. I give people medical advice when I am free, but that is all I can do for them.” Mohammed Aaqib had to deal with both trying for a bed for his brother-in-law and getting him oxygen after his SPO levels began dropping. The Covid helpline did not respond, but he kept at it and was finally rewarded at 3am on Saturday. “The operator told me that I should contact Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital. When I did, I was so lucky to get a bed there. My patient’s oxygen had dropped to 62, but he is doing better now,” a relieved Aaqib said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/almost-no-empty-bed-people-wait-helplessly/articleshow/82122410.cms||Pankhuri Yadav
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Vasai-Virar’s civic body hid 243 Covid deaths, says BJP leader||MUMBAI: After allegations that 10 Covid-19 patients had died due to oxygen shortage in the Vasai-Virar region earlier this week, its civic body has been accused of hiding 243 fatalities since January. BJP leader Kirit Somaiya has written to the state human rights commission alleging that 62 critically ill Covid patients died while they were admitted to hospitals in the Vasai-Virar region between April 12 and 13 due to lack of oxygen. He further alleged till the 13th of April, the Vasai-Virar Municipal Corporation (VVMC) had shown 23 Covid-19 deaths for the month, whereas the actual figure should have been 201; records showed in February, the stated death figure was five even though the fatalities totalled 16. In January, 20 fewer Covid deaths were reported, he alleged. On April 12, 10 Covid deaths were reported in two private hospitals in Nalasopara, allegedly due to oxygen shortage. The VVMC data released on both April 12 and 13 did not mention the 10. Somaiya produced Covid-19 death certificates of 62 patients who had succumbed to the infection between April 12 and 13. Some of them had been moved to hospitals in Thane after they had reportedly failed to get required oxygen in Vasai-Virar. VVMC health officials said the fatalities data released on a day-to-day basis was of those patients whose deaths were confirmed as Covid deaths. In a press statement, health officials said data of suspected deaths was sent to Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). “Only after confirmation is received from ICMR, the death data is made public,” said the medical health officer Dr Surekha Walke.  Meanwhile, critically ill patients continued to be turned away from hospitals due to shortage of oxygen. VVMC said 10 tonne of oxygen was being transported daily from Raigad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/vasai-virars-civic-body-hid-243-covid-deaths-bjp-leader/articleshow/82108720.cms||---

Police admitted her to an orphanage on Friday after treating her at the Ponneri GH. Ravi, a mason, and Sankar, a fortune-teller, decided to get rid of their mother Gandhimathi as they could not provide for her, police said. The woman, who was emaciated due to lack of food, told police that her sons took weekly turns to accommodate her at their houses. After her elder son refused to take care of her, she was staying with her younger son for the past few weeks. On Friday, Sankar took Gandhimathi on his bike, rode 20km along with a friend from his home at Sekkadu near Manali, dumped her and sped away. The woman was struggling there for nearly three hours before some villagers spotted her, police said. The woman, who gave her husband’s name as Radhakrishnan, a coolie, couldn’t say if he was alive. A few villagers who were heading to a nearby riverbed around 8pm on Thursday heard the woman’s feeble cry and rescued her. She was trapped in thorny bushes and was writhing in agony. The villagers informed police and alerted ‘108’ ambulance service. Ponneri assistant superintendent of police Kalpana Dutt said, “The woman needed immediate medical attention. A team from the Ponneri police station led by inspector Martin Premraj sent her to the hospital.” Tiruvallur district superintendent of police S Aravindhan said, “We have not registered any case. We will register a case if she is willing to complain about her sons.” During questioning, the woman Gandhimathi told police that she stayed at her second son Sankar’s house. She was shuttled from her elder son Ravi’s house and Sankar’s house once every week. As her elder son refused to take care of her, she stayed at Sankar’s house for the past few weeks. Police said Sankar took his mother Gandhimathi on his bike early on Friday. His friend also sat on the bike riding pillion behind the older woman. They dumped the woman in the bushy area and sped away. The woman apparently struggled lonely there for about three hours before the villagers spotted her. Her husband Radhakrishnan, a coolie, and the couple has two sons Ravi and Sankar. She told police that Ravi worked as a construction mason, and Sankar works as a fortune teller. Watch Shocking!

It will enable the patients to maintain their oxygen level at home. Additional municipal commissioner Praveen Ashtikar said, “We will be buying 1,250 oxygen concentrators shortly. We have already started finding out the manufacturers and suppliers of the oxygen concentrators. The Covid patients form Nashik city, who have been given discharge, will be provided oxygen concentrators.” Bapusaheb Nagargoje, medical superintendent officer of NMC, said it will take around 15 days at least for the procurement of the oxygen concentrators. “Apart from the discharged patients to maintain the oxygen level at home, the mild symptomatic patients who require oxygen will be provided this,” he said. Moreover, many corporators have offered their corporator funds for the purpose to the NMC commissioner. Some corporators have already given their consent letters to the NMC commissioner to use their funds to buy oxygen concentrators. Corporator Varsha Bhalerao said that she had given a letter to municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav, urging him to use her funds under corporator funds for the procurement of the oxygen concentrators. Another corporator Pravin Tidme has also given the same letter to municipal commissioner. Meanwhile, NGO Balganesh Foundation has also taken an initiative to provide oxygen concentrators to the needy people for the period of five to 10 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-civic-body-to-buy-oxygen-concentrators/articleshow/82106546.cms||Tushar Pawar

Significantly, Hodarkar has been ousted from his position barely two weeks after he was elected defeating Cabral-backed Vishwas Sawant 8-7. Director, directorate of settlement and land records, Johnson Fernades was the presiding officer at the meeting where the motion was put to vote by a secret ballot. Chief officer of CCMC Ajay Gaude told TOI that a meeting to elect Hodarkar’s successor will be held in due course of time. Minutes after Hodarkar was declared elected as chairperson on April 1, nine councillors had moved a no-confidence motion against him which was, however, rejected by the director of municipal administration (DMA) on technical grounds. Subsequently, they had moved another no-confidence motion against Hodarkar which was also rejected by the DMA on April 9, also on procedural grounds. The very same day, they moved yet another no-confidence motion — this time, however, signed by six councillors — which, ultimately, resulted in Hodarkar’s ouster on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/curchorem-civic-body-ousts-two-week-old-chairperson/articleshow/82108724.cms||---

The decision comes just two days after the Central Board of Secondary Education took the unprecedented decision to cancel its Class X and defer its Class XII board exams, which were also to begin May 4, in view of rising Covid cases. The council said it would review and take a final decision on the exams by the first week of June after closely monitoring the pandemic situation. Students who were to take the ICSE have been given two options: Either appear for the exam at a later date or skip it altogether. “For those who choose not to appear for the Class X exam, CISCE will develop a fair and unbiased criterion while preparing the results of such candidates,” said CISCE chief executive and secretary Gerry Arathoon. The CBSE, while cancelling its Class X exams, had said candidates would be awarded marks based on a formula it was working on, and that a student dissatisfied with her or his marks would be offered a choice of taking the exam at a later date, when these could be safely held. There’s another difference. While CISCE has decided to review the situation and “take a final decision on the exams” in June, CBSE had announced that the situation would be reviewed on June 1. While the deferment of ISC and ICSE was expected once CBSE made the announcemen, several parents of ISC candidates aren’t happy with the postponement. A parent said schools could have arranged to hold the exams by maintaining all Covid-appropriate protocol. “Monotony has set in after taking online classes for a year. Now, they are facing uncertainty. I couldn’t even pursue the opportunity to send my son abroad for the fall session, considering he will not be able to submit the original transcripts on time,” said a father. Some Class X students expressed doubts whether the formula-based marks would be acceptable to them. “We have noticed outstanding performers are usually at a loss by not taking the tests,” said a principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/icse-isc-exams-postponed-to-be-optional-for-class-x-students/articleshow/82108741.cms||Somdatta Basu

East Delhi Municipal Corporation, which faces space crunch, has set up a closed unit at Swami Dayanand Hospital from where waste is transported for incineration regularly. “We have deployed four vehicles in two zones along with staffers from the sanitation and health departments. Workers from the health department explains the procedure for keeping biomedical waste of infected people during the first visit,” said an official. From April 1, it is collecting on average 8kg biomedical waste every day. A Delhi Pollution Control Committee-appointed company then lifts it from the hospital on a daily basis. On Friday, South Delhi Municipal Corporation dedicated 53 covered auto-tippers for lifting such waste. “Our sanitation inspectors and health teams are acting immediately on receiving a list of infected people from the local administration. The waste is transported to the waste-to-energy plant at Okhla,” said leader of house Narendra Chawla.

---||Chandigarh||Bone-dry Perch dam turns graveyard for wildlife, villages, fish||Perch dam (SAS Nagar): For decades, villagers had not seen vultures. And then, these great scavenger birds descended in droves on the graveyard of their water tower to feast on dozens of carcasses of thirsty Sambar fawns mauled by packs of stray dogs. Tourists and bird-watchers from the Tricity would sit on the dam’s parapet to enjoy the vistas of sylvan charm. But now, flocks of vultures can be seen perched on the same parapet overlooking a scorching, empty bowl of stacked-up silt littered with bones picked clean by vultures. The dam that supplied irrigation water to the villages of Perch, Seonk and Nada situated behind the PGIMER has gone completely dry leading to crop losses and delivering a body blow to wild species habituated to a perennial source of water. The water of the dam got drained out completely after an attempt by Punjab Kandi Area Development (KAD) engineers to repair a leakage in the sluice gates came a cropper. The repairs led to a “mechanical failure”, the valve went “free” and water broke out from the damaged regulator. Within two days and nights, the entire dam had emptied out. Species such as the Long-tailed and Savanna nightjars breed around the dam due to an abundance of insects spawned by water. In end-May and June, the dam hosts dozens of the 'monsoon bird' or the Pied cuckoo that migrates from Africa. The drying of the dam in the 27 years since its inception in the Shiwalik foothills is considered a very rare occurrence. The dam's longevity is anyways under severe stress due to the deposition of silt, a common malady that faces Sukhna lake and other dams of the foothills. Mirzapur dam also got recently “choked” due to silt deposition. “We will now have to wait for the monsoons for Perch dam to fill up. However, this breakdown of the sluice gate has given us a god sent opportunity to repair the old valves and to clear out silt from the pipes. By the time monsoons come, our work will be complete and we estimate that the repaired mechanical parts and de-siltation exercise will ensure the dam survives for another 25 years,” sub-divisional officer, KAD, Shyam Verma, told TOI. Not just wildlife and villagers, the fish contractor granted rights by the Punjab Fisheries department for Perch dam is a bitter man. “I lost an estimated 500 quintals of fish stock. This is because KAD engineers did not warn me before going in for sluice gate repairs. The dam waters got released and my fish was flushed into the nallahs. I was able to retrieve just 1.5 quintals of fish by the time I got to know of the disaster and was able to requisition trained workers to retrieve fish from the fast-emptying dam. I will be issuing a legal notice to the KAD for damage compensation to the tune of Rs. 50 lakh,” fish contractor, Kuldeep, told TOI. For the beleaguered wildlife, the Punjab Forest and Wildlife department has dug a small water hole at the parched dam. "We feel very sorry for the sambars and birds that are dying of thirst. We are also supplying water to these creatures in our own small way. Our villages do not have many tubewells, the dam was the lifeline," Kashmir Singh, husband of the sarpanch of Chhoti Perch, told the TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bone-dry-perch-dam-turns-graveyard-for-wildlife-villages-fish/articleshow/82107222.cms||---

Petrol pumps were operational even during the lockdown last year. The association has surveyed staffers contracting the infection while working at the pumps. “We have recently conducted the survey of our all petrol pumps in the district and found that the over 200 staffers were infected since the outbreak of the pandemic last year, but no staffer has succumbed to infection,” said Sudarshan Patil, secretary of the association. Patil said family members of the staffers were also infected. Bhushan Bhosle, the president of the association, has appealed to the district administration for the staffers of the petrol pumps to be treated as frontline workers and vaccinate them irrespective of their age and can continue providing fuel to customers. “Moreover, their staffers should be given an insurance cover like the health staff of the government,” said Bhosle. There are around 450 petrol pumps across the district, including 250 outlets in Nashik city. Over 5,000 staffers are working across all petrol pumps in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/treat-petrol-pump-staff-as-frontline-workers/articleshow/82106579.cms||Tushar Pawar

Vivekh is on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support in the intensive care unit and his condition is critical, the hospital said. He had received Covaxin on Thursday. The 59-year-old actor was brought to the emergency room in an unconscious condition around 11am by his wife and daughter after he complained of discomfort. “He suffered an attack on the way, probably because the blood supply to various parts of the body, including his brain, was affected. He was unconscious and without a pulse when he arrived. He was resuscitated by the emergency medical team. After doctors found a block in critical blood vessels in his left coronary artery, called the left anterior descending artery, he was taken to the cath lab for angioplasty and stenting. It took nearly an hour for the doctors to remove the block. He was then put on an ECMO,” said hospital vice-president Dr Raju Sivasamy. Doctors said the deterioration was due to acute coronary syndrome with cardiogenic shock. It was not related to the Covid-19 vaccine he received on Thursday, they said. Test and CT reports showed that he did not have Covid-19. This was the first time the actor had come to hospital with an attack like this, Dr Sivasamy said. Vivek had a “mild elevated blood pressure”. On Thursday, the actor was declared TN’s ambassador for creating public health messages. He received Covaxin in Tamil Nadu Government Multi Super Speciality Hospital here and urged others to come forward to take the vaccine. While a committee for adverse event following immunization (AEFI) comprising doctors and scientists will hold a detailed investigation into the cause of the cardiac event and its possible link to the vaccine, state health secretary J Radhakrishnan said preliminary medical reports suggest it is a “temporal association, not linked to the vaccine”. On Thursday, more than 830 people took Covaxin in Tamil Nadu Government Multi Super Speciality Hospital. “Six people, who came with Vivek, also took the vaccine. Today also many received the vaccine. Doctors here say we are told that a person may not develop such a severe block in a day,” he said. The Indian Council of Medical Research has recommended the vaccine for people with at least 20 comorbid conditions, including cardiac and kidney ailments. “A committee of the central government has recommended the vaccine for people with more than 20 comorbid diseases. What happened today is an unfortunate incident,” he said. The actor, who was introduced by director K Balachander, is popular for his comedy tracks in several movies, including “Run” (2002), “Saamy” (2003), “Parthiban Kanavu” (2003), “Perazhagan” (2004), “Anniyan” (2005) and “Sivaji” (2007).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/actor-vivekh-critical-after-heart-attack/articleshow/82108727.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||India||PM Narendra Modi reviews oxygen status, production to be increased||NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi reviewed the status of oxygen availability across 12 high burden states and asked officials to ensure synergy across ministries and state governments to ensure adequate supply in the country. He also called for seamless and free movement of tankers carrying oxygen throughout the country. The review came in the wake of a surge in critical Covid-19 cases needing oxygen support, resulting in sudden high demand for medical oxygen, particularly in states reporting a surge in daily new cases. Keeping in view the rise in demand, the Centre on Thursday initiated several measures including ramping up production, utilisation of surplus stocks and mapping of requirement of high burden states with oxygen sources. The government has also decided to import 50,000 tonnes of medical oxygen. The PM was informed that the Centre and states were in regular contact and estimates for projected demand were shared with states. Accordingly, 4,880 tonnes, 5,619 tonnes and 6,593 tonnes were allocated to these 12 states for meeting their projected demand on April 20, April 25 and April 30, respectively. The PM suggested increasing oxygen production as per the capacity of each plant. The government has exempted all inter-state movement of oxygen tankers from registration of permits to enable easier movement. The PM was informed that states and transporters have been asked to ensure tankers move round the clock with drivers working in shifts to ensure faster turnaround and adequate capacity to meet the surge in demand. Cylinder filling plants will be permitted 24-hour working with necessary safeguards. The government is allowing industrial cylinders to be used for medical oxygen after due purging. Similarly, nitrogen and argon tankers will be automatically allowed to be converted to oxygen tankers to overcome the potential shortage of tankers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-narendra-modi-reviews-oxygen-status-production-to-be-increased/articleshow/82109940.cms||---

The Anmod Ghat section connects Goa’s Dharbandora taluka with Joida in Karnataka, and is filled with immense diversity of floral wealth. The spring season here sees the flowering of a variety of wild flowers. The Dendrobium lawianum is one such species of scented wild orchids, which blossoms during the spring across the Ghat. Dendrobium lawianum species generally grows on trees and rocks. The Dendrobium lawianum that blooms in Anmod Ghat section is a small epiphytic herb, which grows and flowers on the indigenous species of trees of the Ghat. Pune-based Mayuresh Kulkarni, a researcher, who is presently carrying out studies on wild orchids, said that habitat destruction is now posing a threat to Epiphytic orchid diversity, like the one seen in Anmod Ghat. “It is often a cause of species becoming threatened. Dendrobium lawianum, which is endemic to Western Ghats of India, can be seen blooming in natural forest even by the road side. If trees are being chopped then it will be big loss to biodiversity, conservation is key to save nature,” said Kulkarni. Like other road sections where tree cover has been affected due to work of widening being carried out across the country, the highway passing through Anmod Ghat is also undergoing expansion. Gajanan Shetye, a wildlifer fascinated with the beauty of the Dendrobium in the Anmod Ghat section, said, “The fragrant species is endemic orchid and for its existence within the fragile ecosystem, insect pollination in the species need specific vectors to visit.” This epiphytic orchid is generally resilient to even to vagaries of climatic changes due to its adaptive habits and specialised roots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/natures-delight-anmod-ghat-comes-alive-with-blossoming-of-fragrant-wild-orchids/articleshow/82108742.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

---||Goa||Withdraw strike, come for talks: Chief minister Pramod Sawant||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Friday urged the taxi operators to withdraw their strike and come for talks. The taxi operators have been protesting at Azad Maidan at Panaji for the past few days over the GoaMiles app-based service and installation of digital taxi meters. Science and technology minister and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo also met the chief minister over the taxi operators’ issues. “The chief minister told me that the taxi operators should end the strike. My request to the taxi operators is to withdraw their strike. They should sit across the table with the government to resolve their issues,” he said. Lobo said that they should talk to the government to find a solution. “There will be a solution,” he added. Blaming the taxi operators, tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar said that, “It is because of their (taxi operators) actions that GoaMiles was introduced and the company came to Goa.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/withdraw-strike-come-for-talks-cm/articleshow/82108748.cms||---
---||Delhi||Ambulance services: From hearse to worse||New Delhi: Himanshu Kalia, who runs the Shaheed Bhagat Singh Help and Care Society that provides ambulance services in the city, has seen the wreck that Covid-19 can leave families in. “The situation is much grimmer than last year,” said Kalia. “Recently, a family summoned us to Model Town for the cremation of the mother. After the body was brought down from the third floor, the family refused to accompany it to the crematorium. We had to arrange everything.” From families refusing to go with a body for cremation to long waits outside hospitals, from the sudden spike in cost of oxygen cylinders to a multi-fold increase in demand for PPE kits, Delhi's ambulance/funeral van service providers have seen it all now. They are working round the clock under extraordinary conditions. Twinkle Kalia, wife of Himanshu, said that their fleet of 16 ambulances have been all pressed into action almost 24 hours a day in the last two weeks. The risk they face is evident in an ambulance service employee succumbing to the coronavirus recently. The wail of racing ambulances is being heard across the city. Delhi government’s health bulletin says that 2,279 calls for ambulances were received on Friday. In east Delhi, Jitender Singh Shunty, who runs 18 ambulances, said the situation is deteriorating by the day and they now receive more than 200 calls for help daily. “We can’t help everyone, but we do try to respond to all calls from east Delhi areas,” said Shunty. “Yesterday, we drove 27 patients to hospitals and ferried 39 bodies to cremation grounds.” Two of Shunty’s staff have contracted the disease. Many ambulance and hearse operators say that the patient load in this Covid wave is much higher than the peak of last year. Himanshu Kalia said that they had received calls from families where several people from a one-year-old to 70-year-olds had been infected and showing serious symptoms. Deepak Sharma, who runs Sewa Ambulance Service with its 10 vehicles, said that they respond to 50-60 calls for ambulances every day, most of them being requests from Covid patients. “We transported 12 critical patients yesterday whose oxygen levels had reached alarmingly low levels when they were in home isolation,” revealed Sharma. “The situation last year was not even a fraction of the current ground situation.” In south Delhi, N S Bhatt, who runs the PS funeral and Ambulance Service from South Extension, said each of his ambulances is transporting 10-15 patients a day. “We have a fleet of 30 ambulances. The sudden spike in people needing hospitalisation is frightening. There have been some occasions when we have taken two patients from the same family to hospitals,” Bhatt said. He claimed never to have seen such a crisis in the 30 years that he has operated his ambulance service. Himanshu told of how they often have to drive the patient from one hospital to another due to lack of Covid beds. While Sharma said the big problem was the long waiting time at hospitals and testing centres, Himanshu said they spend 4-5 hours on a single patient. The Bhagat Singh operator added, “The shortage of beds is a reality. We were arranging a bed for a patient and finally managed to get one in Bahadurgarh in Haryana after three days. But by that time, we were informed the person had succumbed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ambulance-services-from-hearse-to-worse/articleshow/82122443.cms||Paras Singh
---||Delhi||Civic bodies ready strict norms for weekly markets||New Delhi: After Delhi government’s order to allow only one weekly market in a zone in a day, the three municipal corporations have prepared a list of such establishments. No market has been listed for the next weekend on April 24 and 25. Covid test centres will also be set up for vendors at weekly markets and they will be allowed to display items only after RT-PCR testing. “In case of a positive report, action should be taken as per the protocol prescribed by the health department, Delhi government with regard to quarantine, contract tracing and treatment,” South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC)stated in a circular. If customers or vendors at any weekly market don’t follow instructions prescribed in Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s orders, such markets will be closed as per an order of the district magistrate or the zonal deputy commissioner of the corporation, it added. North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash said the licensing officers would ensure that slips were issued only to legal vendors with all documents. “Also, limited vendors in permissible space would be allowed. We expect the vendors’ association to cooperate so that no need arises for closing a market for any violation,” he added. The corporation has 104 weekly markets, out of which 24 are in highly-congested areas/zones and will be shut for now. “We have markets in Kirari, Subhadra Colony and many other places where streets are narrow and it will be risky to allow weekly markets in congested residential lanes,” said the mayor. Officials have also been asked to avoid weekly markets near regular markets as it will automatically lead to congestion. In south Delhi, out of 98 markets, more than half won’t be allowed, while in east Delhi, only 10 of the 64 weekly markets have got the nod. For convenience of all and strict compliance of norms, details of the nodal and licensing officers concerned have been specified in the orders, said an SDMC official. They will make random visits to ensure compliance of Covid norms such as arrangement of adequate distance between vendors and buyers, wearing of masks by all and boards stating the starting and end points of a market. A compliance report will be submitted to zonal offices every day by field officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/civic-bodies-ready-strict-norms-for-weekly-markets/articleshow/82108763.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Goa||Goa Inc, tech association bat for GoaMiles||Panaji: Support for the state government in the ongoing stand-off with the tourist taxi operators continues to pour in, with the Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) and the Goa Technology Association (GTA) becoming the latest industry bodies to demand that the app-based cab service GoaMiles should continue. Both the industry bodies have written to the chief minister saying that Goa needs an app-based taxi service that is cost-effective and efficient. They also pointed out that shutting down GoaMiles will send a wrong signal to private investors who seek to invest in Goa. While GCCI welcomed the “strong stand” taken by state government against the “strong-arm tactics” of the tourist taxi operators, GTA said technology is the future, which the tourist taxi operators and the government need to accept. “The clear stand taken by chief minister Pramod Sawant and his ministerial colleagues is a welcome step. While insisting on the installation of the fare meters, the government has shown its willingness to resolve the issue in an amicable manner by offering to pay for the cost of the meters,” said GCCI president Manoj Caculo. The state government has offered to fund the design and rollout of a unique app-based service for the taxi operators, which they have refused to accept. The taxi operators are also reluctant to install digital fare meters. This, said Caculo, creates a bad name for Goa and its tourism industry. He said the present attitude of the taxi operators “smacks of arrogance” for which they are “increasingly losing sympathy” of Goans and tourists. GTA president Mangirish Salelkar said that the app-based taxi service benefits IT professionals and clients who often travel at odd hours, especially to the airport. He also pointed out that GoaMiles has created employment for locals and can also help reduce drunk-driving incidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-inc-tech-association-bat-for-goamiles/articleshow/82108757.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No Cambridge exams, schools to give scores||Mumbai: The Cambridge International late on Friday announced it had cancelled exams for schools in India and had decided to move to school-assessed grades for classes X to XII. In a communication to its affiliated schools, the board said, “In view of the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in the country, we have decided to switch Cambridge International schools in India, from exams to school-assessed grades, so that students can receive certification and progress with their education.” The board has shared with its schools guidelines for collecting evidence to support school-assessed grades and how to work out the final grade for each student. As multiple education boards either cancelled or postponed board exams over the past few days, students and parents from Cambridge International-affiliated schools were a worried lot as the board had earlier stated that it would take a decision by Monday, April 19.  “It was very stressful considering that the exam was only a couple of days away. We are relieved with the board making an announcement,” said a parent. Parents were worried if the exam was conducted, it would risk the health of the stakeholders. “Was Covid-19 going to disappear over the weekend,” said a parent from a south Mumbai international school. Students who wish to withdraw from the exam series can do so through the portal until April 17 and then by writing to the board in the next seven days. The board has organised webinars over the next week to share information on the school-assessed grades process, including using evidence to allocate grades, using the rationale document and avoiding bias when setting these grades. The board, though, has said it would not be able to offer the same option for primary and lower secondary checkpoints and students could withdraw from March series.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-cambridge-exams-schools-to-give-scores/articleshow/82108752.cms||Vinamrata Borwankar

The additional secretary of MoHFW, Arti Ahuja, pointed out that at some Covid facilities in Nashik district the Covid patients and those with suspected symptoms had been kept in the same ward. ‘The team said that it was a serious concern, requiring urgent examination,’ the letter sent by the officer to Dr Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary, department of health and family welfare, Maharashtra. The other important factor highlighted was the absence of death reviews in many facilities of the district. ‘The teams visiting Jalgaon as well as Nashik districts have found that death reviews were not being carried out in many facilities in these districts’, the letter added. The review of the number of deaths within 24 to 72 hours of admission was important to resolve problems related with late hospital admission, delayed referrals, poor bed management system and communication to the parents. ‘This has to be carried out at all the institutions. This should be part of the action plan to be carried out by all district administrations,’ the officer has noted. The teams noted shortage of remdesivir in Dhule, Jalgaon districts and oxygen shortage in Nashik and Nandurbar districts. The teams also appreciated the move by the Dhule and Nandurbar district administrations for strengthening the bed capacity. The teams have said that the other districts who are experiencing surge in cases should take such steps.The team also expressed satisfaction that Nandurbar district had increased testing capacities by the local administrations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/central-team-finds-gaps-in-covid-treatment-in-n-maha/articleshow/82106598.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The agitating taxi operators also said that they will not budge from their ongoing protest or discuss the issue about installing digital meters till the government comes out with an administrative order cancelling all rent-a-cab licences along with the licences issued to app-based taxi services, including GoaMiles. “The government should come out with an order that app-based taxis, taxi aggregators, rent-a-cab licences will not be issued and all the licences issued till date including to GoaMiles, will be revoked,” said Govekar. “Only after that we will come for the meeting and sit across the table to discuss about the digital meters.” The tourist taxi operators changed their tune and dug in their heels after Godinho rejected their demand for a meeting to be held in the presence of the media and for the meeting to be broadcast live. Godinho had called the agitating tourist taxi operators for a meeting on Tuesday and had also suggested that the counter operated at the Goa International Airport by GoaMiles would be shut down. “We have decided not to go for the meeting. Mauvin Godinho or the chief minister should come here and interact with us,” said another taxi operator. The taxi operators said that closure of the counter at the airport will not resolve their issues. They also said refused to install digital taxi meters. “Digital meters are not installed on tourist taxis anywhere in India. If we have to install digital meters, Goa will be the first state to do so. This government is doing all this because it is a scam,” said Govekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/digital-meters-a-scam-by-govt-say-taxi-drivers/articleshow/82108767.cms||---

While Dhule has been witnessing the trend since April 2, Jalgaon has been recording more recoveries for the last two days from April 14. Dhule district Covid-19 coordinator Dr Vishal Patil said around 450-500 patients are being discharged daily, while 350-400 new cases are detected. “There were four days during this period where fresh Covid cases were more than the daily recoveries. But this happened largely since lab reports of the previous days were pending. We are of the view that the Covid curve in the district has started dipping,” said Patil. He said that the local civic body and rural areas are continuing to conduct over 3,500 Covid tests per day. Dhule’s weekly positivity rate was 23% in the first week of March and has now dropped to around 14.5%. The district’s weekly case fatality rate is less than one percent. The total active cases in the district are over 3,000, bulk of whom are in home isolation. “The next 15 days will be crucial. Since the state government has imposed severe restrictions, people must abide by them. The health manpower and the infrastructure are under severe stress,” said Patil. In Jalgaon too, for the last two days, the daily recoveries hovered around 1,100 while the daily positives were around 900. The district has been conducting nearly 9,000-10,000 tests a day. District guardian minister Gulabrao Patil said although there are signs of improvement people need to follow Covid appropriate behaviour. District civil surgeon N S Chavan said the administration would continue to conduct aggressive testing and contact tracing. “We will not lower our guard,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/daily-recoveries-more-than-new-cases-in-dhule-jalgaon-after-a-month/articleshow/82106586.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

For people approaching the secretariat with grievances and other issues, arrangements have been made at the entrance pass office. People are allowed to drop their letters at a specified place in the entrance pass office as per the CS’s order. Last year, too, the government had prohibited the entry of outsiders and media persons at the peak of the Covid-19 wave.

---||Delhi||Weekend curfew in Delhi may prompt many to defer vax plans||NEW DELHI: The weekend curfew in the capital is likely to hit the Covid vaccination drive even though Delhi government has permitted travel for this purpose on the production of an e-pass. The drive usually witnesses higher turnouts over the weekend. Vijay Pankaj, a resident of New Ashok Nagar, said he was planning to get inoculated at a centre in east Delhi on Sunday, but has now put it off. “The pendency of application for e-passes is very high in all districts. It will require going through a lot of trouble to get an e-pass and, then, go for vaccination,” complained Pankaj. Last Sunday, a total of 1,04,862 got vaccinated. The turnout dipped to 74,397 a day later. On Thursday, only 78,137 people got the jab. A doctor, who works at a private hospital, said the government order on weekend curfew lacked clarity on use of e-pass for vaccination. “The weekend curfew order states that people going for Covid-19 vaccination are allowed with an e-pass (in soft or hard copy), which can be obtained by applying on the Delhi government website. Elderlies prefer to be accompanied by one family member when they go for vaccination. The order doesn’t make it clear if the person accompanying the beneficiary will need a separate pass,” said the doctor, who did not want to be identified. Dr Arun Gupta, president of Delhi Medical Council, said that higher vaccination coverage was essential for fighting Covid. “Due to restrictions and the need to obtain an e-pass, some people may avoid vaccination on weekends. The government should allow movement without an e-pass for this purpose.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/weekend-curfew-may-prompt-many-to-defer-vax-plans/articleshow/82108778.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Hyderabad||Woman kills baby to get rid of sarpa dosha||Hyderabad: In an alleged case of human sacrifice, a woman slit the throat of her six-month-old baby girl at Mothey in Suryapet district on Thursday evening. Police said 32-year-old Bharathi confessed to her relative that she sacrificed her baby to overcome the influence of negative forces on her and her family. She was charged with murder by police on Friday. Mothey police said Bharathi killed the baby with a knife when her family members were away. “After killing the baby, Bharathi told her relative that her action has helped in saving the lives of her family members. Bharathi believes she has ‘sarpa dosham’,” sub-inspector Praveen Kumar told TOI. Five years ago, Bharathi was told by someone that she suffered from sarpa dosham. Since then, she has been under the influence of a superstition that the dosham is wreaking havoc in her life. “She was also hooked on to videos on YouTube to know how to overcome sarpa dosham,” police said. Police said Bharathi’s focus on overcoming sarpa dosham had increased in the last one-and-a-half months and she had finally decided to sacrifice her daughter to overcome the dosham. At the time of the murder, her husband Krishna, who is an agriculturist, had gone to his relative’s house. His mother was at their agriculture field, while father was sleeping outside their house. After the accused informed her relative, who stays close by, about the murder, other family members rushed to her residence only to find the baby in a pool of blood. Police said Bharathi had even kept a photoframe of a god near the baby. A murder case was registered against Bharathi based on a complaint by her husband.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/woman-kills-baby-to-get-rid-of-sarpa-dosha/articleshow/82108772.cms||---

He also said that it is not possible to scrap GoaMiles and he is getting many representations not to scrap GoaMiles. “I will not consider any preconditions for talks. Respectable delegation representing all taxi operators are most welcome and they will be permitted just like last time. This is not a tiatr what they are doing at Azad Maidan. It is not a show which I am going to attend to livestream it,” Godinho said  Godinho said that 10,000 taxi operators cannot hold entire the tourism industry and the state to ransom. “There is an equally strong opinion that there should be competition in Goa. Goans should get cheap transport and this is being said by a large section. Goans question as to why there is no cheap taxi service in Goa like that in other states,” he said. On accepting taxi operators’ demand to scrap GoaMiles, Godinho said “If I pass administrative order and scrap GoaMiles then they will go to the court and get a stay and they will remain forever. Taxi operators do not realise simple things,” he said. Godinho further asked if app-based taxis are not operating anywhere else in the country. “Ola, Uber and taxi meters are everywhere, only we have different taxi drivers. Have they come from the moon? We are trying to accommodate them but they are not ready to understand,” he said. The transport minister said he has called taxi operators to meet him on Tuesday. “If families and children of taxi operators come to meet the chief minister then it would become counterproductive, he added. He also said that there is a direction from the high court to install digital meters and they are already in contempt. “I heard that the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) is going to the high court or somebody else will go. If the high court directs, they have to install the digital meters,” he said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/meeting-with-cabbies-not-tiatr-to-live-stream-godinho/articleshow/82108777.cms||---

Ten IAS officers were also made nodal officers for Delhi government’s Covid hospitals. An order signed by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal stated that Sisodia would be responsible for inter-ministerial coordination till further orders. Immediately after the order was issued, Sisodia held a meeting with departmental heads of Lok Nayak Hospital, the city’s largest Covid facility, along with health minister Satyendar Jain. “LNJP has been at the forefront in the battle against Corona and the team is on a high moral ground to provide best treatments to patients,” Sisodia tweeted. Sisodia also visited two major Covid hospitals of Delhi government in northeast Delhi along with Jain — Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital near GTB Enclave and Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital in Tahirpur. “Visited GTB Hospital and reviewed its patient admission system.

The decision was taken in the party state secretariat held on Friday. Even though the CPM also considered the names of all India Kisan Sabha leader Vijoo Krishnan and CPM leader Cherian Philip, it is learnt that a general consensus was on sending two new faces to the Upper House. Though there was a discussion on whether the outgoing Rajya Sabha MP of the CPM K K Ragesh should be given a second term, the party secretariat decided against it. After the LDF meeting, LDF convener and CPM acting state secretary A Vijayaraghavan said that the party decided on the candidates after examining the competence of all its potential candidates. Though the CPM secretary did not answer on why a second term was denied for Ragesh, he said that Ragesh was one of the best parliamentarians and he performed well like other communist leaders who were deputed for parliamentary responsibilities. He said that both the candidates who are being sent to the Rajya Sabha will display similar exemplary performance. He added that Brittas, who performed Leftist journalism well, was chosen in the wake of the party’s previous experiences of sending journalists to the upper house of Parliament. Both Brittas and Sivadasan hail from Kannur district. Sivadasan is presently an independent member of Kerala state electricity board (KSEB). Three RS seats from the state are falling vacant on April 21. The members who are retiring include IUML leader P V Abdul Wahab, CPM leader K K Ragesh and Congress leader Vayalar Ravi. While the LDF can win two seats, the UDF can win one. Outgoing MP P V Abdul Wahab, who is getting a consecutive term from the UDF, filed his nomination papers on Friday. The Rajya Sabha election will be held on April 30 in the wake of the high court order that the elections to the three vacant seats should be held before the term of the current assembly expires. The polling will be held from 9am to 4pm on April 30, on which the existing members of the assembly will vote. Though there are 140 seats in the assembly, only 131 MLAs will vote for the Rajya Sabha poll. While four MLAs Thomas Chandy, S Vijayan Pillai, C F Thomas and K V Vijayadas passed away during their tenure, three MLAs P J Joseph, Mons Joseph and P C George have resigned from the assembly. Two other MLAs K M Shaji and Karat Razak do not have voting rights as they are facing election-related cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cpm-to-send-john-brittas-v-sivadasan-to-rajya-sabha/articleshow/82108065.cms||---

This resulted into a heated argument between the two and video of the same has gone viral. Following the incident, PSI Shinde made a station diary entry at Kranti Chowk police station. The incident took place Mahatma Phule Chowk in the Aurangpura area of the city where PSI Shinde was deputed at a fixed point to keep a check on those stepping out home without any valid reason. When contacted, Kranti Chowk inspector Ganpat Darade said, “Our officer stopped a man in his 20s and asked about the reason for stepping out. The youth informed that he is heading to hospital for giving water and biscuits to a family member admitted there.” Not taking any chance, the PSI checked with the doctor based at the facility and found that though youth’s family member is admitted, there were no such instructions by the doctor to the patient’s relatives to bring water bottles and biscuits for the patient. On learning about it, MLA reached the spot and contested that this youth hailing from Lasur station had stepped out for the sake of delivering water and biscuits to the patient.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/bjp-mla-psi-get-into-heated-argument/articleshow/82108060.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Though Ernakulam has witnessed rising demand for CNG vehicles following the Covid-19 pandemic, registration of these vehicles touched double digits for the first time in January with 14. As per the details available from the dashboard of ministry of road transport and highways, it was 16 and 12 in February and March, respectively. As many as five CNG vehicles were registered in the first 12 days of April. A total of 47 CNG vehicles were registered with the Ernakulam RTO in first three-and-a-half months this year as against total 36 in 12 months in 2020. Rising fuel price, environment friendly and high mileage encouraged customers to drive towards CNG vehicles. As the CNG vehicle sector is in nascent stage in Kerala, the optimum utilization of the existing fuel stations is almost nil. There are 10 CNG fuel stations in Ernakulam and one more is likely to be commissioned near Pathadipalam next month. “Each fuel station has a capacity to supply 1,000 litre CNG per hour. But the daily supply from 10 stations comes to around 25,000 litre per day only, though the demand is rising. As only 15-20% utilization of these stations are happening now, our purpose is not to set up more stations. Instead, make full utilization of the existing ones,” said spokesperson of Indian Oil-Adani Pvt Ltd in Ernakulam. As many as 27,957kg CNG fuel was sold through these 10 stations on Monday. “There is tremendous growth in demand compared to previous years. Fuel station at Chakkaraparambu and another one near a multi-specialty hospital at Edappally witness good takers for CNG fuel. The price of CNG has come down to Rs 54.50 per litre compared to previous months. People should understand that liquid fuels are not fuel of future and is definitely pollutants,” he said. Private buses have also started converting into CNG-powered vehicles. As many 25 buses were converted into CNG so far in Ernakulam. Nine stations, commissioned in last three to six months, are in Thrissur and the utilization is less. Meanwhile, the automobile sector finds it difficult to meet the rising demand as there are no ample production. As the second wave of the Covid looms large over Kerala, automobile dealers are keeping their fingers crossed over the sustaining the momentum for demand of CNG vehicles. “The demand is still in nascent stage, but there is rising demand. Of the total inquiries, 5% is related to CNG vehicles. But the problems we face is that we cannot meet the rising demand due to shortage of production of such vehicles,” said a automobile dealer in Kochi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/registration-of-cng-vehicles-touches-double-digits-in-dist/articleshow/82107298.cms||T C Sreemol

Not anymore. According to a study, the impact of micro-hydel projects in the area was such that around 40-45% water sources have dried up, leaving little scope for catching any fish. Agriculture and allied activities, too, have suffered. The findings were part of a five-year field study conducted by the researchers of Kumaun University with the support of Colombo-based International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and co-ordinated by Arizona University. They explored the impact of six micro-power projects, ranging from 0.2MW to 12.6MW, on 11 villages in the region. While three of the plants were built on the Saryu river, the others are on its tributaries. According to the researchers, blasting and tunnelling for such projects have ravaged natural water sources that have fed the villages in the region for centuries. They said that this also contributed to loss of agriculture and employment, forcing many to migrate from the area. PC Tiwari, researcher at Kumaun University, said that even small hydel plants on Himalayan rivers have a devastating impact on the area’s sensitive ecology though many have advocated it for long considering the limited scope. “Through our extensive field work and interaction with locals, we found that the irrigated land in the region has gone down by 25% after the projects were set up. More than 10% of the locals who were solely dependent on fishing are now doing odd-jobs,” he added. In Kanyouti village, the researchers found that at least 25 families were affected by the power project and 20 of them migrated to different areas. They said that the irrigation potential of the village has since declined by 60% and the food production halved. Echoing similar concerns, Pratap Singh, pradhan of Lahur village where the cultivated land, pastures and livestock have decreased by over 75%, said, “The Saryu river flows just below our village and we have heard that many families used to sustain on fishing in earlier times. None of that exists now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/micro-hydel-projects-spell-doom-for-fishing-agriculture-in-bageshwar-study/articleshow/82107299.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Aurangabad||Wife, paramour held for murdering husband 3 months back||Aurangabad: Within 24 hours of finding a human skeleton buried in a farm, local crime branch of Aurangabad rural police arrested the deceased man’s wife and his cousin brother on the charges of murder and for causing disappearance of evidence. Police said that the body was found during ploughing of the farm on Thursday afternoon. The deceased farmer has been identified as Raghunath Ghongde (40) of Balanagar in Paithan taluka of the district. The arrested suspects have been identified as Yashoda Ghongde (30) and Dattatray alias Shivaji Ghongde (38) — both resident of Balanagar. Impressed by the detection, superintendent of police Mokshada Patil has announced cash reward of Rs 10,000 to the police team. LCB inspector Bhagwat Phunde, citing confessions by the suspects, told TOI, “The dceased’s wife Yashoda and his cousin Dattatray were allegedly having an extra marital affair for the past couple of years. Recently, when Raghunath found about it, he started ill treating and assaulting Yashoda over it. As a solution to it, the duo decided and bludgeoned the man to death before burying him at a neighbouring farm.” Paithan sub-divisional police officer Gorakh Bhamre said that the suspects have confessed that sometime around Makarsankranti, Raghunath assaulted Yashoda over her alleged relations with his cousin. The woman contacted Dattatray and asked him to find a solution to it. Accordingly, Dattatray reached out to him and convinced Raghunath to come to his water filter plant’s shade for sleeping. “After the man fell asleep, the suspect brought the woman there and he bludgeoned the victim’s head with a boulder while the woman allegedly used a stick to hit her husband,” said Bhamre. After the victim succumbed to the injuries, the duo took the body to their relative’s farm situated in gat number 117. Fearing that their activities may get noticed, they dug a shallow pit of one-and-half feet and buried the man. Police said that nobody in the family or village raised question over the man’s disappearance as he was devotee of Kanifnath and would often go to the temple and stay there for months together. The suspects, too, gave it an impression that he has gone to the temple.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/wife-paramour-held-for-murdering-husband-3-months-back/articleshow/82108059.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Vadodara||Vaccinations nosedive as nCov cases head northward||Vadodara/Surat/Rajkot: At a time when vaccination is said to be the most effective weapon to fight Covid-19, apart from wearing face masks and maintaining social distancing, the number of jabs administered per day has gone down drastically a fortnight. This has defeated the expectation that with all above 45 years of age eligible for the shot, the process would gain momentum. In the initial days of April, there was notable enthusiasm for vaccination with thousands turning up at vaccination centres to take the jab. But as the month progressed the numbers started going down drastically. For instance, Surat had vaccinated 32,342 persons on April 5 but this number was reduced to less than one fourth on April 15 when merely 9,795 persons were vaccinated. The situation was similar in Rajkot and Vadodara that are reeling under a raging second wave of Covid-19. In Surat, the daily vaccination doses have been on constant decline. According to officials in the Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC), the workforce is diverted to attend Covid patients because of the unprecedented rise in cases and people also don’t come out of home out of fear.The development is surprising in wake of the fact that last month many were looking desperate to get vaccinated. The 45-year-olds were desperately looking for means to get vaccinated and those who were younger were eagerly awaiting their turn.“There was a lot of demand for vaccination from those who were 45 or above and did not have comorbidities. People were enthusiastic in the initial days, but this reduced later. Even we are looking into the reason for the development,” said medical officer (health) of Vadodara Municipal Corporation Dr Devesh Patel. Sources pointed out that many were still looking to get vaccinated, but were afraid to do so fearing that the vaccination centre may be crowded and they may catch Covid-19 there. Many in general are preferring to stay home or limit their movements to bare minimum in wake of the explosion in the number of cases. It is also believed that some others were either sceptical of side effects or were unsure of whether it would work. Doctors have been emphasising that while the shot may not prevent a Covid-19 infection, it will definitely make it mild. Civic bodies, hospitals and doctors have been running a campaign encouraging vaccination, but to no avail so far.An official in Vadodara also pointed out that while they were keen to increase vaccination again, the system was overwhelmed with the rise in Covid-19 cases. The workforce was diverted to the city from rural areas in Vadodara to take care of vaccination and other duties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vaccinations-nosedive-as-ncov-cases-head-northward/articleshow/82108212.cms||---

The dalit youth murdered the 18-year-old vanniyar girl after she broke up with him and decided to marry a person chosen by her parents from their own community, police said.  Those arrested were identified as P Rangasamy, R Raveendran, 26 and Rangasamy's 16-year-old brother hailing from a dalit colony in the village. Police produced them before a magistrate who remanded Rangasamy and Raveendran in judicial custody while sending the minor boy to an observation home. PMK founder S Ramadoss demanded that police invoke stringent sections of relevant acts including IPC against the three men, who murdered the teen girl. He urged the government to book the three under Goondas Act.  Police said M Saraswathi, a nursing student was found dead near her house on April 1. Police began inquiries following a complaint by her brother M Veeramani. Inquiries revealed that Rangasamy and Saraswathi were in love for the past two years. Rangasamy disappeared from the day the girl was found dead, leading to suspicions about his involvement in her death. A police team managed to trace him and Raveendran hiding under a bridge in the district and arrested the duo. “Raveendran confessed to murdering the teen girl by strangling her using her dupatta. He said he met her near her house in the wee hours of April 2 and urged her to elope with him to get married,” said Thirunavalur police inspector S Sreenivasan. “But the girl refused to heed his demand and said she wanted to break their relationship as she decided to marry a person chosen by her parents from her own community,” said the inspector.  This irked the dalit youth and he with the help of his friend and minor brother strangled her to death using her dupatta, said inspector Sreenivasan. Thirunavalur police registered a case under IPC sections 302 (punishment for murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of an offence or giving false information to screen offender), 404 (dishonest misappropriation of property possessed by deceased person at the time of his death) and 294 (b) (obscene acts and songs) and arrested them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/dalit-youth-kills-vanniyar-lover-after-her-parents-choose-another-groom/articleshow/82109693.cms||Bosco Dominique
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Ever Given manager helping 2 seafarers get home||HYDERABAD: Two seafarers of 25-member Indian crew have been allowed to leave the container ship ‘Ever Given’ by the Suez Canal Authority (SCA). The authorities granted permission based on the recommendation of the ship owner who reportedly informed that the two seafarers had some personal emergency back home. SCA chairman Osama Rabie said the two seafarers were permitted to disembark and return home to India. Rabie, however, did not give out the names of the seafarers. “I can confirm on behalf of BSM that the SCA has approved our request to allow two of our crew members to return home on compassionate grounds. We are making arrangements for the two crew members to be replaced, signed off and flown home as soon as possible. We are grateful to the SCA for allowing these two individuals who needed to get home to their families,” a spokesperson of Bernhard Shulte Shipmanagement, maritime solution provider and technical manager of Ever Given, told TOI. The National Union of Seafarers of India (NSUI) has also expressed happiness. “We are concerned for the rest of those on board. There is worldwide support for the 25 Indian crew on board Ever given. We want to see all the crew members out of this mess as the main issue between the SCA and the ship owners is about compensation, which can settle between themselves,” NUSI general secretary and treasurer Abdulgani Y Serang told TOI. The National Shipping Board and NSUI raised concerns over the safety of Indian seafarers, especially after the container ship was ‘arrested’ by the SCA on April 13. The SCA is seeking damages to the tune of $1 billion for the loss of revenue it suffered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ever-given-manager-helping-2-seafarers-get-home/articleshow/82108787.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

---||Mumbai||UK’s home secy orders Nirav Modi extradition||London: UK home secretary Priti Patel has ordered the extradition to India of Punjab National Bank scam accused, billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi (50). Nirav is at Wandsworth prison in London. India wants to extradite him to stand trial for defrauding PNB of Rs 6,498 crore, of laundering proceeds and interfering with witnesses and evidence. District judge Sam Goozée had on February 25 sent Nirav’s case to Patel to decide whether to order extradition, saying he was satisfied there was a “prima facie” case. He said his extradition would be compatible with European Convention on Human Rights and would not be oppressive to extradite him despite deteriorating mental health. A UK home office spokesperson said the extradition order was signed on April 15. Nirav has 14 days to apply for permission to appeal to UK high court. He may seek leave to appeal against both decisions of district judge and home secretary. If permission is granted, the HC will consider the appeal. If there is no application to appeal, he must be extradited within 28 days of the secretary of state’s decision. Appeals to Supreme Court can only be made if the HC has certified that the case involves a point of law of general public importance. In early January, on the last day of closing submissions in court, Helen Malcolm QC, representing Indian authorities, had outlined allegations against Nirav. “Letters of undertaking were issued for wholly worthless trade, in fact bogus trade, with companies that were part of Modi’s group. Large parts of sums of the LoUs were used to repay earlier LoUs that were not the allowed purpose. Vast sums were siphoned off through dummy companies to Nirav himself and members of his family,” she had said. Clare Montgomery QC, representing Nirav, said Malcolm’s claim that there was circular trading or that dummy companies were controlled by Nirav did not matter “as that is not the basis of the charge of fraud”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/uks-home-secy-orders-nirav-modi-extradition/articleshow/82108795.cms||---

Police authorities said that notices have been issued to officers heading police stations of Chikalthana, Bidkin, Vadodbazar, Sillegaon, Pachod, Fardapur, Gangapur, Kannad City and Sillod city. The notices were issued citing ill-preparedness as well as failure in meeting crime detection, initiating preventive action, clearing pendency, filing of charge sheets and other pro-people initiative related targets, said an officer privy to the development. “The police station chiefs are expected to meet the given targets which contribute to the overall performance of an entire unit. Failure of handful officers in meeting the target should not be the reason for the entire unit to suffer,” said a senior officer supporting Patil’s move to shoot show cause notices. To ensure that none of the routine works of the police station chiefs as well as deputy superintendent of police gets hampered, a monthly review meeting was conducted on Friday at 8 am. Soon after the meeting started, Patil found that some of the officers were not at all prepared for the review meeting. After reviewing the situation evolving in rural areas due to fresh surge in cases, Patil instructed the officers to crackdown on those found violating Covid-19 norms and also against those taking advantage of the restrictions at the cost of commoners. She also reviewed conditions of the policemen currently undergoing treatment for Covid-19 and instructed the officers to take utmost precautions while being at public place or at the police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/sp-shoots-show-cause-notice-to-nine-police-station-chiefs/articleshow/82108066.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Ludhiana||Lockdowns tugging at garment inc already hanging by thread||Ludhiana: Partial and full lockdowns in several cities of other states have made city industrialists, especially those in the garment sector, anxious.Businessmen say their customers in other states have asked them to cut down the quantity of already-placed orders or delay the dispatch, and it is very likely that full cancellations will follow. The reason is reduction in sales due to the closure of shops and malls on account of lockdowns. In desperation, some businessmen—who are dealing with customers in Delhi and Mumbai where complete closure of shops and malls have been ordered—have cut down their production. Harish Kairpal, finance secretary of Knitwear Club, says, “In Maharashtra, all non-essential establishments have been closed till May 1 and in Delhi, similar situation prevails with shopping malls shut till April 30, besides the weekend curfew. In other states too similar lockdowns have been implemented. Some other states are also heading towards another lockdown. In such a scenario, the garment industry is once again hit, as our buyers have already started requesting us to either delay the dispatch of the consignments by three to four weeks or cut down the initial orders. They cannot make sales when there is restriction on movement of people.”Narinder Mittal, general secretary of Ludhiana Business Forums, has got a sense of déjà vu. He says, “The current situation has brought back the memories of last year, when the garment industry witnessed many cancellations and unprecedented losses. Already there is a slump in the market with no new orders coming, and now with the customers delaying the deliveries and some even contemplating cancellation, we are in deep trouble. Previous payments from customers are pending and now we have readied new orders that are not going to be delivered, leading to a blockage of huge amount of money.”Atul Saggar, general secretary of Apparel Manufacturers’ Association, Ludhiana, is scared of stocks piling up. “Due to lockdown in Maharashtra and Delhi, where some of our biggest customers are based, we have decided to cut down our production. We do not want stocks worth lakhs piled up in our factories. There is high risk of cancellations of a large number of orders due to the uncertainty.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/lockdowns-tugging-at-garment-inc-already-hanging-by-thread/articleshow/82107305.cms||Mohit Behl

---||Delhi||Update info on beds in real time, don’t miss any helpline call: CM||New Delhi: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday directed officials to ensure real-time availability of Covid bed information on the government’s Delhi Corona application. The number of beds available should be exact, Kejriwal said while reviewing the capital’s Covid-19 situation. All hospitals have also been asked to maintain an adequate flow of information on the real-time availability of beds. Delhi government is focusing on increasing the bed capacity in city hospitals to offer adequate treatment to the Covid patients who require urgent assistance. The chief minister asked officials to create more beds, especially those with oxygen supply, across the capital. The hospitals should also have multiple assistance numbers and nodal persons so that no urgent call is missed, Kejriwal said. With the Covid cases rising on an alarming scale, the hospitals are getting multiple calls on availability of beds and for emergency assistance. Healthcare teams must reach out to every patient in home isolation and provide oximeters, and these patients should receive every assistance at home, Kejriwal added. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who has been appointed nodal officer for Covid, health minister Satyendar Jain and senior officials, including those from the health department, participated in the meeting. It was convened to review the pressure on the existing healthcare infrastructure and explore the possibilities for increasing the bed capacity and other infrastructural requirements to strengthen Delhi’s fight against the viral infection. The chief minister stressed that oxygen beds should be provided to every patient in need, and more beds are required to ensure this. Directions were also issued to make sure that all helpline numbers of the hospitals, which are also mentioned on the Delhi Corona app, should remain fully functional 24x7. “Not only one, but there should be multiple assistance numbers in the hospitals, and nodal persons should be appointed for every helpline number. No urgent calls should be missed and turned down,” the chief minister said. Close to 30,000 of the 61,000 active cases in the capital are currently in home isolation. “Delhi’s home isolation system is the best in the country, and we must continue to set an example. Our health teams should reach out to every patient who is under home isolation, and provide oximeters,” Kejriwal said. “The public should receive all help and assistance while we are suggesting more and more patients to prefer home isolation if they have mild or no symptoms,” the chief minister added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/update-info-on-beds-in-real-time-dont-miss-any-helpline-call-cm/articleshow/82108810.cms||AlokKNMishra

KP Suhail, who is the treasurer of DYFI Peringalam area committee, was named as the fifth accused by the police in the FIR. Suhail in his FB post said that he would not be able to kill Mansoor who was like a brother to him. Suhail also alleged that he was being falsely implicated in the case just because he posted a FB status and that he was hounded for the past 10 years since he left IUML and joined CPM. Suhail said that he was ready to undergo lie detection test to prove his innocence and has written a letter to state police chief in this regard. Suhail surrendered in the afternoon after turning up in court with a lawyer. He was remanded by the court to custody. Suhail had on the day of attack posted a Facebook status which said that the ‘Jackals of Muslim league who attacked the Comrade would remember this day for years’ and IUML leaders had said that it was an open threat and proof that the murder was pre-planned. With the surrender of Suhail, the total number of accused in the case who are in custody has risen to eight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/5th-accused-suhail-surrenders-in-court/articleshow/82108075.cms||---
---||Kochi||Police take byroads used by gang to zero in on accused||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The investigation team which probed the highway robbery at Pallipuram was put on the right track of inquiry by the maze of byroads used by the gang soon after the robbery. The audacious nature of the attack and robbery initially gave an impression about an interstate gang being involved in the case. The police team did not take that bait and repeatedly took the paths used by the gang to drop off Lekshmana who was travelling with Sampath. The gang had taken a right turn from Mangalapuram and driven up to Pothencode and Vavarambalam. They then circled back to the same point. This was indicative of someone familiar with the route and the possible involvement of local gang members. The next step was to make a list of all history-sheeters hailing from Pothencode, Pallipuram and Mangalapuram. They were summoned one by one and posed seemingly innocuous questions mainly focusing on their whereabouts on the day of attack. Police then let them off giving an impression that they were off the radar. However, the shadow cops tailed them and in the meantime, police officers coordinated with cybercell to map their tower locations and cross checked whether the findings matched their statements. In persons where there was a mismatch, they were summoned again. As expected, police found that many had gone off the hook, they either didn’t turn up for further questioning or went into hiding. The contacts which these people maintained were closely being monitored by police, which opened up to further links. “Usually a gang which is new to a place would commit the crime and drive off as far away as possible. In this case, they somehow seemed to linger and at the same time kept circling the same by roads. This may have been a ploy to misguide any investigation. However, it gave us a clear lead about the direct involvement of a local gang as only they could have planned the escape route using familiar byroads,” a senior police official said. The police team also repeatedly took the same path of Sampath, starting from Ayurveda College Junction to Pallipuram. On the way, they collected all possible CCTV visuals. However, many of the visuals gave side images which were scarcely useful. Police also collected details of an Ertiga and Swift car from vehicle dealers and made numerous calls to contact details in the RC book. They kept striking off the less probable ones and the list shrank to a few contacts which made it easy for the final step. The gang had also tried to mislead police by using fake number plates. However, with police repeatedly coursing the same route, they chanced upon abandoned number plates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/police-take-byroads-used-by-gang-to-zero-in-on-accused/articleshow/82107332.cms||Aswin J Kumar

---||Nagpur||BJP refutes Congress charges of Covid inaction||Nagpur: Ruling party leader in the civic body Avinash Thakre on Friday said the active role of senior party leaders, including Union minister Nitin Gadkari and leader of opposition in state assembly Devendra Fadnavis, helped the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) to create facilities to treat Covid-19 patients. Corporators from all parties have extended support to the civic body to fight the pandemic, he added. But sadly, Thakre said, the Congress spokesperson was playing dirty politics in this time of crisis. On Thursday, Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe had claimed that BJP leaders including Gadkari and Fadnavis were not seen anywhere when their hometown was facing severe health crisis due to surge in Covid-19 cases. Addressing a press conference here, Thakre without naming Londhe claimed Gadkari had solved the crisis of shortage of oxygen by arranging five tankers and 50 metric tonne oxygen to the NMC. Due to Gadkari’s efforts the city received 9,000 Remdesivir injections, while on Friday, Fadnavis arranged another 1,000 injections for the city. Fadnavis had also ramped up the bed capacity for Covid-19 patients by arranging 200 beds in National Cancer Hospital. “However, the state government is trying to create hurdles in the efforts taken by the party leaders,” Thakre claimed. The BJP-ruled NMC had also launched mass RT-PCR tests and vaccination drives for vegetable vendors, autorickshaw drivers etc. “So, the allegations levelled by Congress are baseless,” the ruling party leader and senior BJP corporator said. BJP corporator and lawyer Dharmpal Meshram, however, blamed the Maha Vikas Aghadi-led state government for the Covid-19 crisis. Due to poor planning, the situation has worsened in the state, he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-refutes-congress-charges-of-covid-inaction/articleshow/82107326.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Crowds start receding from Kumbh ghats||HARIDWAR: After days of massive gatherings for the Maha Kumbh Mela, the crowds have started ebbing at the bathing ghats of Haridwar. With the rising fear of Covid-19 and the fourth, and last, shahi snan 12 days away, pilgrims have begun departing from Haridwar. “We had come to Haridwar for the holy bath and wanted to stay close to the Kumbh Mela area. But my family asked me to leave the city as soon as possible because Covid-19 cases have been constantly rising. Some of us wanted to see the Ganga aarti but we decided against it,” said Durga Das, 50, a pilgrim from Mathura in UP. He had reached Haridwar with family and friends for the third shahi snan and had been staying at the Bairagi camp area. Meanwhile, seers of the Vaishnavite Bairagi sect are staying put, holding religious discourses and organising skits in the run-up to Ram Navami, which is on April 21. But attendance at these events has been diminishing. Other seers especially of Shaivite akhadas — to which Naga sadhus belong — are preparing to leave. The Niranjani akhada had already announced on Thursday that it had asked the seers in its camp to leave and that they would participate in the last shahi snan symbolically. “There are practically no pilgrims in the city. Locals are not showing any interest in visiting the camps. Many seers also tested positive, so most of them are planning to leave,” said Baba Amolanand Giri of the Juna akhada, the largest of the 13 akhadas. With pilgrims leaving, hotels and commercial establishments also saw dip in business.“Many pilgrims have cancelled their bookings amid Covid-19. The few who stayed on have been checking out of hotels and guest houses,” said Vibhas Mishra, president of the Haridwar hoteliers’ association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/crowds-start-receding-from-kumbh-ghats/articleshow/82107339.cms||MS Nawaz

The monthly cash assistance of Rs 1,000 should have gone to 34.02 lakh beneficiaries of nine schemes, including the elderly persons, differently abled, destitute widows, destitute/deserted wives, poor unmarried and refugees. But with the government in a limbo, awaiting the assembly election results, many are yet to receive their benefits. Neither the local revenue officials nor the bank authorities are providing a proper reply, say the distressed beneficiaries. A M Sasikumar, differently-abled and a native of Manappudaiyur in Thanjavur said, “I have three daughters and a son and my wife is an agricultural labourer. The government’s assistance is of great help. While the pension is credited before fifth of every month, we are clueless about the delay this month. We are struggling to make ends meet.” V Elangovan of Kumbakonam has not received his monthly pension nor has S Malathi of Pudukkottai, a differently-abled pensioner.  After the first wave of Covid-19 hit livelihood options, the poor and downtrodden are now left in the lurch. K Nagaraj from Sivakasi said he made several attempts at a nationalised bank’s ATM to find out if the sum had been credited. “It has been the same everywhere in Virudhunagar. We haven’t received the amount till date. Officers don’t even attend our calls,” he said. The Tamil Nadu association for the rights of all types of differently-abled and caregivers (Taratdac) secretary S Namburajan said the members of various districts, including Tuticorin, Salem, Trichy and Cuddalore complain about the delay. Even the cash assistance of Rs 1,500 under the four schemes of differently-abled department has been affected. The state government allotted Rs 4,307 crore for social security pension schemes this year. While the amount is credited in the beneficiaries’ bank accounts in the first week through district treasury, there is a delay in raising the bill by the officials due to election work. Sources say that districts like Ariyalur, Dindigul, Coimbatore crossed 30% of disbursement and the rest are picking up after the festival holidays. Districts like Chennai, Cuddalore, Trichy, Tiruvarur, Virudhunagar, Villupuram and Tiruvannamalai are lagging in updation. “The sum has been allotted to the districts on April 4 itself. The election work and the subsequent holidays delayed the process. Every beneficiary will get the cash support in a week’s time,” said a senior official.

NGO roots for mother’s as middle name||Mumbai: Birth certificate application form should offer parents the option to decide whether the child’s middle name and surname should that be of the father or mother or both, says a petition sent by an NGO to the Prime Minister’s Office recently. The NGO also launched a social media campaign titled ‘Named after Mom’ which has pushed for an amendment in the birth certificate application form to enable this choice. “Currently, father’s name by default becomes the middle name and surname of the child in government-issued identity documents, beginning with the birth certificate. It’s patriarchal to not even give the choice of taking the mother’s name or surname, when both parents have equal rights in bringing up a child,” said Siddharth Bothra, founder, Hope for Better India Foundation, the NGO which has taken up the campaign. “Parents should have the choice. Like for instance: whether to opt for the mother’s first name as the child’s middle name and then have the child take the father’s surname or vice versa or go only for one parent’s names, he said. Bothra, an entrepreneur, has two sons, aged 5 and 9. “I wanted my wife’s name as the middle name for them. But she said the kids would have problems with government documentation.” Currently, for instance, if a child takes the mother’s name as middle name, certain government documents register a discrepancy and reject the application, he said. “A birth certificate is a primary document based on which other government identification cards and documents like Aadhaar, PAN card, passport etc are issued. A choice in the birth certificate application form would ensure no future complications in other government-issued documents,” Bothra added. Certain government documents like the PAN card application form give an individual the choice. The form has a column which says: ‘Select the name of either father or mother which you may like to be printed on PAN card.’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mums-the-word-ngo-roots-for-mothers-as-middle-name/articleshow/82109490.cms||---

It was found to be containing high quality Sunmica (laminate sheets) and plywood worth crores whereas contents were allegedly declared as scarp. The importer was yet to file a bill of entry for this cargo, which is still being examined.A highly-placed source said, “Based upon specific intelligence, an operation was conducted at ICD, Container Corporation of India (CONCOR), Focal Point, Ludhiana. Goods in a 40-foot container, which had been lying there for the past about four months and was imported from Canada’s Montreal by a city-based firm, were examined. According to the initial declaration as per the import general manifest (IGM), this container had 18-20 tonnes of heavy metal scrap (HMS). But during examination by DRI officials not even a single piece of HMS was found and instead it was stuffed with a huge quantity of high quality laminate sheets and plywood.”Source said the import duty on scrap was in the range of 2.5% to 5%, while on laminate sheets and plywood was 30% to 40% and as per the initial investigations the approximate value of the goods found in the container was above Rs 1 crore, but due to the huge quantity, exact valuation would take some time. The goods have been confiscated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/laminate-sheets-and-plywood-in-cargo-instead-of-junk-finds-dri/articleshow/82107360.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Delhi||LG directs chief secy to set up portal, helpline to provide hospital info, address grievances||New Delhi: With Delhi witnessing a massive surge in Covid-19 cases and many patients finding it difficult to get hospital beds — particularly ICU beds — lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Friday gave directions to set up a helpline to inform about availability of beds. “In view of the spurt in Covid-19 cases, reviewed the status of enforcement of orders issued by Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) along with the chief secretary, commissioner of police, divisional commissioner, municipal commissioners and other senior Officers concerned,” Baijal tweeted on Friday. The LG reviewed the enforcement of Covid appropriate behaviour in the meeting, apart from the preparedness for implementing the guidelines that have been issued. “Advised officials for targeted and aggressive deployment of enforcement teams in markets /mandis etc., particularly during peak hours to ensure compliance of Covid appropriate behaviour by all,” he tweeted. He also tweeted that he has advised the chief secretary to set up a portal and a helpline to provide information about availability of beds in hospitals and also set up help desks in all hospitals to assist patients and attendants and redress grievances, if any, under the supervision of nodal officers and medical superintendents. He also said that it was emphasised in the meeting that to contain the present surge of Covid-19 cases, coordinated action should be taken in association with civil society organisations, including market associations, resident welfare associations, etc., to ensure compliance of Covid-related guidelines and protocols. Baijal also advised targeted and aggressive deployment and enforcement in areas where crowding happens, as also during peak crowding hours and prepare a temporal graph of the outcomes. He asked the chief secretary to set up the helplines, which would inform about the availability of beds in hospitals, apart from display of the information on government portals. Baijal also directed that these helpline numbers and other information should be amply publicised. Baijal appealed to all citizens to proactively cooperate in enforcing and observing Covid appropriate behaviour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lg-directs-chief-secy-to-set-up-portal-helpline-to-provide-hospital-info-address-grievances/articleshow/82108856.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||War of words between NSS chief, CPM continues||Kottayam: Nair Service Society (NSS) and CPM which had locked horns during the elections on the Sabarimala issue are in no mood to end their war of words. CPM acting state secretary A Vijyaraghavan ignited a new row as he wrote in an article that community organisations like NSS should stay within their limits and issues prop up only when they cross their limits. In the article which appeared in the party organ ‘Desabhimani’ on Friday, the CPM leader lambasted NSS general secretary G Sukumaran Nair for the stand he took during the elections and wrote that once the counting of votes is over he will realise that the members of the Nair community did not concur with him. Mannath Padmanabhan, the founder of the NSS, is also criticised after being praised. Mannath is praised for his stand against bad customs and casteism while he is criticised for his participation in the liberation struggle (vimochana samaram). The CPM leader also termed the reactions from the NSS supremo during the elections as part of anti-Leftist politics. Community organisations like the NSS are not considering how the communal polarisation and economic reforms of the BJP government are affecting the members of their community. Community organisations are trying to become the tail of retrograde forces that are cooperating with hard core Hindutva project and economic liberalisation of the RSS. Vijayaraghavan advises that leaders like Sukumaran Nair should realise that it is against the interests of the poor and the ordinary members of their community. Vijayaraghavan also says that the Nair community members will not allow NSS to deviate from its equidistance policy and join with retrograde forces which are anti-Left. Within hours after the article appeared in the newspaper, Nair shot back asking Vijayaraghavan not to advise the NSS in a “round-about way”. In a press note, Nair found fault with Vijayaraghavan saying that the CPM leader doesn’t know that NSS is extending maximum cooperation for economic reforms without giving chance for communal polarisation. NSS remains equidistant from all political parties and organisations like RSS while sharing a good relation with all of them. Though NSS is a community organisation it functions as a social organisation. Vijayargahavan is criticising NSS, linking it to politics because of his lack of knowledge about NSS as well as Kerala’s history. NSS never tried to interfere or passed opinions on the issues related to the governance of the LDF government or controversies related to it, he said. Regarding his reaction on polling day, Nair said that there was nothing connected to politics, religion or caste in the reply to the media persons. It was the chief minister who gave a religious colour to the reaction by linking it to gods and other deities, said Nair.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/war-of-words-between-nss-chief-cpm-continues/articleshow/82108089.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair
---||Delhi||Weekend curfew in Delhi: For next two days, home is your world||NEW DELHI: The weekend curfew aimed at breaking the Covid-19 infection chain means that unless you have a valid emergency or you fall in an exempted category, you can’t step out of your house till 5am on Monday. The weekend curfew came into effect at 10pm on Friday after the city recorded its highest ever daily tally of new Covid at 19,486 and a toll of 141. Only those who are exempted from the restrictions, such as Central and Delhi government personnel, police, fire and emergency services personnel, healthcare personnel, and those engaged in electricity, water, sanitation services, etc, will be allowed on the streets on production of valid identification cards. Fifty people will be allowed to move for weddings and 20 for funerals. Travellers going to or coming from airports, railway stations and inter-state bus terminals will be permitted to move on producing valid tickets. Pregnant women and patients will also be allowed to travel for accessing health services. Those who are engaged in other essential services such as food and grocery shops, chemists, petrol pumps, cold storage, etc. but don’t have government identity cards can apply for e-passes at www.delhi.gov.in. Delhi government clarified on Friday that those who already held a night curfew e-pass needn’t re-apply for a new pass, the old one being automatically considered valid during the weekend curfew. E-passes are also being issued to those going for vaccination during the weekend or attending wedding ceremonies. Candidates sitting for any examination during the weekend can show their admit cards to be allowed to travel. Examination staff will similarly be permitted on the streets if they produce valid ID cards. While public transport will be available for people with valid IDs or e-passes, personal vehicles can expect to be stopped at pickets at regular intervals and IDs and documents scrutinised. Those found violating the curfew order will have cases registered against them and possibly face arrest too. Shops dealing in non-essential goods will remain shut. Movement of domestic workers is prohibited too. Home delivery only of essential items will be permitted. Apart from Delhi Police, the district authorities will oversee the strict compliance of the curfew order. A team of the New Delhi district carried a unique drive at Connaught Place on Friday with two volunteers dressing up as Yamaraj and Chitragupta and both urging people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and stay home over the weekend.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/for-next-two-days-home-is-your-world/articleshow/82108837.cms||Sidharatha Roy

One opposition councillor had been issued notice to appear before the urban development minister Milind Naik in a disqualification case on Friday afternoon when the meeting to discuss the no-confidence was fixed at Sakhali Friday afternoon. The high court of Bombay at Goa stayed the disqualification proceedings after the councillor moved the court apprehending a move to disqualify him. Stating that the high court once again rescued democracy in Goa, Kamat said that it is unfortunate that people of Goa have to approach the courts to protect their constitutional rights. “I am happy that the decisions of the Ccurts have once again reaffirmed faith of people in the judiciary,” he said in a statment. The ouster of the municipal chairperson is a clear signal that the “end of the BJP government in Goa is near”, stated Kamat. He congratulated all the seven councillors of Sakhali Municipal Council “who remained strong and united”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-rescued-democracy-says-kamat/articleshow/82108827.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Planned surgeries put on hold as blood banks run dry||KOLKATA: Surgeons across city hospitals are postponing some planned surgeries as blood banks are running dry because of low supply due to summer, Covid-19 and the elections. “We had to put a planned surgery on hold due to want of blood. We needed to keep three units of O negative blood prior to the surgery. The family could arrange donors five days later and after that we carried out the surgery,” said a surgeon attached with a private hospital. “This is quite alarming. Even common groups like A or B positive are not available on some days,” said transfusion medicine specialist Ritam Chakraborty, in-charge of the blood back at AMRI Dhakuria. Apart from patients who need to undergo surgery, cancer and thalassemia patients who need regular blood transfusion are also at the receiving ends. “Our monthly requirement is about 500 units. Right now even though we have less number of patients, our needs are being supplemented by organisations like Project Life Force,” said Swapan Adak, the blood bank in-charge at Saroj Gupta Cancer Centre and Research Institute, Thakurpukur. People’s Blood Bank would earlier supply 250 to 270 units of blood products daily to hospitals across the city. The stock with the bank is currently running out. “I fear the crisis will go on till at least the middle of May,” said Bratish Neogi of People’s Blood Bank. “With no camps around we have no stock left. We appeal to corporate houses to conduct camps to tide over the situation,” said Kailash Khandelwal of Lions District 322b1 Blood Centre. Blood donation camps organised by political parties and local clubs are the main source for blood banks. But due to the elections there has been no such camps for over a month. “We have to keep some units of blood ready for patients who undergo major surgeries. There certainly is a shortage right at the moment,” said oncologist Gautam Mukhopadhyay. The Central Blood Bank in Manicktala currently has stock that would last only for a week. Officials at the bank are currently rationing the supply. To tide over the crisis employees at Swasthya Bhawan recently donated blood at a camp at the state health headquarters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/planned-surgeries-put-on-hold-as-blood-banks-run-dry/articleshow/82108100.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

One such patient is 53-year-old Sharda Tidke. Her family could not find a bed in any hospital after her oxygen saturation level dropped below 85. At this juncture, Pande arranged a portable oxygen concentrator (POC) at Tidke’s east Nagpur residence. Tidke’s kin, Bipin told TOI she had tested positive for coronavirus a fortnight ago and was in home isolation. But her condition deteriorated after her oxygen saturation started dropping. “We took her to five hospitals for admission but could not find a bed with oxygen in any ofthem,” he said. The dejected family brought Tidke back home. Soon they learnt that Pande had some oxygen concentrator machines for patients in home quarantine. “We contacted her and today Tidke is doing well,” Bipin claimed. Like Tidke, Dinesh Kawde too is grateful to Pande for becoming a saviour to his mother Shantabai. The corporator provided them a portable oxygen machine too. Kawde had lost his father to Covid a fortnight ago due and her mother too fell sick. Her oxygen level was very poor and the family could not find a hospital bed for her. “One of my relatives informed me that Pande and her husband Bijju were providing oxygen machines to needy patients. We requested for one and the corporator provided the desperately-needed help,” Kawde said. He returned the machine after his mother’s condition improved on Thursday. Like Tidke and Kawde, Pande has helped at least eight citizens including senior and comorbid patients with oxygen concentrators and all of them are now out of danger. The non-availability of oxygen beds for Covid-19 patients and difficulty in finding timely medical help prompted her to acquire these portable oxygen concentrators for home isolation patients. The senior corporator said lack of health facilities forced her to think and do something for the patients. After discussion with her husband Bijju, the senior corporator procured two POCs in March. It helped many home isolation patients having low oxygen saturation level. “The result was satisfactory and we purchased four more early this month,” she said. With demand from citizens increasing, the senior corporator has placed orders for another four, which may arrive in a couple of days. Pande said the machine was very easy to operate and being used as per doctor’s advice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/corporator-pande-turns-saviour-for-many-with-o2-concentrators/articleshow/82108868.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The state government has already cut the duration of Kumbh Mela from four months to two. When queried on the issue, chief secretary Om Prakash told TOI, "At present, there is no proposal to truncate the Kumbh duration. If we receive any official request, we will review it and thereafter take any decision." He added that the issue was not discussed in the Covid-19 review meeting presided over by chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat late on Friday evening. "It is true that the number of pilgrims has gone down considerably in the last few days. Our teams are vigilant and are keeping an eye on the developments.” Meanwhile, two prominent akhadas — Niranjani and Anand — have announced to end their Kumbh proceeding early citing the rise in the number of Covid-19 infections. However, the other akhadas are of the view that Kumbh should run till April 30, the date decided for its official culmination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/no-proposal-to-reduce-kumbh-duration-cs/articleshow/82107376.cms||Kautilya Singh

At ESI hospital, 210 beds will be made available.” Even as Goa reported 927 new cases on Friday and the active tally rose to 6,321, by far the highest since the pandemic began, Sawant refused to put any border curbs. “At present we don’t need to put restrictions on people coming from outside the state,” he said, claiming that “tourists do not mingle with locals”. Sawant said that district collectors would impose restrictions to stop the spread of the virus at public functions. He said that from Saturday, the state would strictly implement fines for non-wearing of masks. He added that people shouldn’t attend weddings and ritual festivals in large numbers. “For weddings and political meetings, spot permissions will be given by deputy collectors,” he said. “Outdoor events would be restricted to 200 people, and indoor events will (also) be restricted.” However, he said that there are no Covid-related restrictions for hotels and “economic activities”. Sawant claimed that “100% infrastructure” has been provided for Covid management, including testing kits, injections, oxygen, etc. However, he appealed to recovered Covid patients to donate plasma. Even as he repeated that no further curbs would be put in place, Sawant said that if required, the Ponda sub-district hospital would be declared a Covid facility. Claiming that private hospitals have facilities to treat Covid patients, the CM said the state has sufficient testing kits. He also said that the SP Mukherjee stadium, Bambolim and the Covid care centre at Fatorda stadium have already been opened. He appealed to symptomatic Covid patients to immediately get admitted to hospital. “We want to decrease the death rate, and for that, I want cooperation from the public,” he said, adding that the state has sufficient stock of vaccines. Test reports, which are currently available within 24 hours, will by Monday be made available within 8 hours at the North Goa district hospital for the benefit of travellers, he said. He appealed to people to avoid crowded places. “People should use facemasks, use sanitisers and maintain social distancing at weddings and political meetings,” he said. “People do not follow this. When I attend political meetings, I appeal to people to wear facemasks and maintain social distancing, but they still don’t follow it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-goa-sees-927-new-cases-cm-says-will-add-more-beds/articleshow/82108848.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Two held for growing cannabis in 2-BHK flat||MUMBAI: Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has arrested two persons, including a marine biologist, for illegally growing cannabis in a 2-BHK flat at Dombivli and selling it to high-profile customers in the city. One kg of cannabis worth Rs80 lakh has also been seized. Investigators said the drug was being cultivated using hydroponics, which does not require soil, with seeds imported from the Netherlands. Marine biologist Arshad Khatri and Javed Jahangir Shaikh were arrested from Yari Road in Andheri on Wednesday. Police are on the lookout for Saudi-based NRI Rehan Khan, said to be the main financier of the syndicate. What has baffled the agency is that the accused had been carrying out cultivation using an elaborate set-up in the flat owned by Khan at Palava City for the past six to eight months. It is suspected that the turnover was in crores. The team has recovered the cultivation set-up including PH regulators, plant nutrients, clay pebbles, water pumps, air circulation systems, CO2 gas cylinders and photosynthesis lighting systems from the flat. “Khatri is an expert in hydroponic cultivation and Shaikh used to manage the distribution. They procured cannabis seeds from the Netherlands through the dark web,” said an official. Investigators said hydroponic weed is in great demand among the affluent and at high-society parties. The accused sold it to peddlers in Mumbai and Pune at Rs8,000 per gm. The deals were either in cash or crypto currencies like bitcoins with sales being done using social media apps like Snapchat and WhatsApp. NCB got a tip-off after they arrested Ganesh Shere, an MPSC candidate and Siddhant Amin from Parel last week. During their interrogation, Sahil Shah alias Sahil Flacko’s name cropped up. Flacko is a former neighbour of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput. Flacko and Rehan Khan’s names had figured during a probe into the drug angle in Rajput’s death. Sameer Wankhede, zonal director of NCB, led the team. Meanwhile, in another case, the NCB intercepted African, Onurah Samuel Mike, and seized 30gm cocaine. Mike has told investigators he had got the consignment from Celestian, a Nigerian, who brings cocaine into the country frequently. Celestian had given Mike 50 capsules (500gm) during his last visit. Mike used to sell the cocaine in Andheri, Bandra and Santacruz.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-two-held-for-growing-cannabis-in-2-bhk-flat/articleshow/82108843.cms||Ahmed Ali

The truck was intercepted a few days ago and after investigation, the department found that the total amount of tax evaded in the case along with penalties has, so far, worked out to be more than Rs 4 crore. Ashutosh Baranwal, principal commissioner of CGST, Ludhiana, said, “Based upon intelligence inputs, anti-evasion wing of the commissionerate intercepted a truck around 8.30pm on April 9 on Ludhiana-Sahnewal highway. As per the e-way bill with the truck driver, the goods were declared as aluminium scrap. But an examination of the container by our staff found only 10,030kg scrap and four alloy wheels, while rest was 39.6 lakh cigarette sticks of four different brands. The goods were seized and proceedings initiated. The estimated value of tax evaded along with penalty invokable under Section 129 of the CGST Act, 2017, is Rs 4.41 crore. Further investigation is on.”Baranwal added, “CGST commissionerate, Ludhiana, has placed 18 persons under arrest during the 2020-21 financial year for frauds like bogus billing and availing and applying for input tax credit in fraudulent ways.

---||Kochi||15-year-old’s murder: Main accused surrenders in Kochi||KOCHI: The prime accused behind the alleged murder of a 15-year-old at Vallikkunnam in Alappuzha surrendered at Palarivattom police station in Kochi on Friday morning. The surrendered accused has been identified as Sajayjith, 20, of Vallikunnam, Alappuzha. Later, he was handed over to Alappuzha police. Sources with Kochi police said that the accused turned up at the Palarivattom police station by around 10am and surrendered. Police said he came with a few others who remained outside the station. Soon, the city police alerted the Vallikunnam police station about the surrender. By noon, a police unit of Alappuzha police from the Aroor police station arrived at Kochi and he was handed over to them. The man was handed over with his face covered and police took him to Alappuzha for further investigation. Sources said that it seemed like the accused was hiding somewhere in Kochi after the murder on Wednesday. The case pertains to the murder of a 15-year-old boy who was stabbed to death allegedly by a group of people during a temple festival at Padayanivattom Vallikkunam on Wednesday night. The deceased, Abhimanyu, was an SFI worker and it was alleged that he was stabbed to death allegedly by workers of RSS. The CPM had called for a hartal in Vallikunnam area protesting the murder of the Class X student, who was supposed to attend the ongoing SSLC exams, on Thursday. According to reports, the assailants had come looking for his elder brother, a DYFI worker, but attacked Abhimanyu instead and killed him.  CPM had alleged that it was a planned murder by the BJP and the RSS while BJP denied all the allegations and said it was in no way associated with the murder. The accused is likely to be produced before the magistrate court in Alappuzha later in the day and the police would seek his custody. There are reports that surrendered Sajayjith is an RSS worker. Abhimanyu and two of his friends had suffered stab injuries and the former sustained a deep injury on his back which led to his death, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/15-year-olds-murder-main-accused-surrenders-in-kochi/articleshow/82108113.cms||---
---||Goa||As demand spikes, state feels Remdesivir shortage||Panaji: Along with other states, Goa is also facing a shortage of Remdesivir, the antiviral drug prominently used in the treatment of Covid patients, and it could be a few days before stocks will be replenished. Meanwhile, hospitals doing Covid admissions are compelled to ration the use of Remdesivir. A major distributor in the state, who did not want to be named, told TOI that almost every distributor is feeling the pinch, as manufacturers are not able to meet the sudden huge escalation in demand due to the alarming rise in infections across the country. “Some stock is available here and there, but there is a huge demand and we are trying our best to make the stock available. I think we may receive supply in a day or two, but we are not sure how much we will get,” president of the Chemist and Druggist Association of Goa, Albert De Sa told TOI. The distributor, however, said it might take a week before supply is restored. Goa Medical College (GMC) dean and in-charge of Covid hospitals in the state, Dr S M Bandekar said they have Remdesivir stock and, in addition, their supplier (Wellness Forever) has been asked to keep 10,000 vials ready at any given time. “We have been assured that stock will be made available. We had a meeting with the purchase committee in the morning. Currently, we have the drug in our stock,” Bandekar said. A single vial of Remdesivir costs Rs 4,000. A Covid patient needs to be given six injections of the drug. “Don’t be surprised if a patient gets just one or two injections of Remdesivir when the tally of patients is high. In that case, you can’t blame the hospital,” the distributor said. Unlike in other places, De Sa said hoarding of Remdesivir is not happening here. The Foods and Drugs Administration is strictly monitoring the availability of the drug. “Details of the drug sold have to be submitted to FDA every day. Remdesivir has become gold,” he said. In addition to FDA, the distributor said that the drug manufacturing company also seeks details of the Remdesivir sold to ensure that hoarding and black-marketing of the drug is not happening. “I get calls from several people asking for Remdesivir for relations or friends outside Goa. We don’t sell unless we get all details, which we need to provide to the company as well as the FDA. In places like Pune, a vial of Remdesivir is sold for Rs 15,000 to 20,000,” he said. FDA director Jyoti Sardesai did not respond to both TOI’s call and message about the availability of Remdesivir stock in the state, and for how many days it would last, if at all available. De Sa said Tamiflu, another antiviral drug, has been in short supply, but it is expected to be in circulation shortly. “Except for these two, other drugs used for Covid patients are available,” he said. With the unprecedented surge in cases, the distributor said some have also exhausted their stock of N-95 masks. He said that, from November 2020 onwards, when cases dropped, pharma companies reduced production of Remdesivir. “The drug has a short life span of about three months. A month and a half ago our supplier was asking us to pick as much Remdesivir as possible, but then we had few cases. Then, three to four vials a week were not moving. But now, the situation has reversed,” the distributor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-demand-spikes-state-feels-remdesivir-shortage/articleshow/82108858.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘Local bodies should relax RT-PCR rule for domestic help’||Mumbai/Pune: At a time when some housing societies have been demanding negative RT-PCR certificates from their house help and drivers, the state government has told local authorities to relax their 15-day mandatory random testing for Covid-19. State relief and rehabilitation secretary Aseem Kumar Gupta told TOI on Friday the new state orders do not suggest the test for house help and workers and if local authorities have made it mandatory, they should revise it as it is overwhelming testing laboratories. “However, those with symptoms should get themselves tested,” he said.  Whether at Planet Godrej in Byculla or Ambrosia in Powai or Oberoi Splendour in Jogeshwari, managing committee members of housing societies are taking all precautions to ensure Covid-19 cases do not swell.  “Those washing cars would not be allowed entry beyond the parking lot. Visiting homes to collect car keys from residents is not being permitted in many highrises,” said one society. Another has decided to not allow any visitors or guests. “I have to get to a testing centre to get my report. My madam has given me the money to get myself tested for Covid,” said Pushpa Kadu who works in several residential buildings in Hiranandani, Powai. All part-time staffers entering Planet Godrej have to get themselves tested every 15 days. In a society at Tarapore, Oshiwara, RT-PCR certificates are mandatory even for visitors. “Maid/cooks/drivers/nurses/medical attendees are required to carry a negative RT-PCR test with them, which has a validity for 15 days. Failure to carry such a negative test may result in penalty and action under the relevant government circulars,” said an Oberoi Splendour notice; the society even held a testing camp in its premises. Many have asked residents to encourage their help to get vaccinated. Not many are comfortable visiting testing centres. “I don’t work in buildings that demand tests,” said Asha Kindre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-local-bodies-should-relax-rt-pcr-rule-for-domestic-help/articleshow/82108859.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Vikram Nishad was allegedly stabbed many times by Sandeep Roy (22) and Ganshyam Das (50) on Thursday after a petty financial dispute, Versova police said. DCP Abhishek Trimukhe formed a team after police got a call about a body with injuries near the jetty around 11am. “The team, with the help of local intelligence, tracked the duo within 12 hours. They confessed to killing the victim from Sultanpur in UP who resided on the pavement, doing odd jobs. It seems a financial dispute led to the killing,” said Trimukhe. Nishad hit Roy’s eye, so he called Das, and they both allegedly stabbed him. The duo, who work at the jetty, did not flee after the offence. They were picked up on suspicion after questioning friends. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/2-held-within-12-hrs-of-body-being-found-in-mumbai/articleshow/82109503.cms||---

Meanwhile, a recent health department report shows that the district’s case fatality rate (CFR) for around a month has been below 1.6%, indicating that lesser number of persons died of the disease as compared with those who contracted it. The data derived from state media bulletin shows that the number of deaths in Ludhiana during the last seven days (April 9 to 15) was 36. The figure was 38 in the preceding week (April 2 to 8). This year, the highest weekly fatality count was recorded between March 26 and April 1 at 54.Since the start of the pandemic, the highest weekly casualty count (109) was registered between August 28 and September 3.On the state’s seven-day casualty chart, Amritsar is at the top with 57 deaths, Hoshiarpur second (47) and Ludhiana third. Mansa is at the bottom as no Covid death was reported from there.The health department authorities said there were many factors that worked.Civil surgeon Dr Sukhjeevan Kakkar said, “During the first wave, the case fatality rate was more than 3. But now the same has been around 1.6, which means there are lesser deaths as compared with the cases. Our response and preparedness, including availability of infrastructure, have also improved.”The department officials said fatalities could decrease further if positive patients report directly to hospitals and everybody followed Covid-appropriate behaviour. Deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma said he was optimistic of the disease coming under control after a strong vaccination drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/covid-19-casualty-count-falls-for-second-consecutive-week/articleshow/82107399.cms||Shariq Majeed

---||Goa||Sawant loses civic bodyhold on his home turf||Panaji/Bicholim: In a major setback to chief minister Pramod Sawant, that too on his home turf, Congress-backed panel managed to dislodge the chairperson of Sakhali municipal council, Yeshwant Madkar on Friday. Already the council has vice-chairperson backed by the Congress-led panel. Sawant represents the legislative assembly of Sakhali, which includes the town. The opposition had to move the high court as the government was delaying the meeting to discuss no-confidence.  Tense moments prevailed during the last two days as the opposition accused the BJP of trying to use tricks to avoid the no-trust. BJP members had also tried to get a Congress-supported councillor disqualified so that the stalemate prevailed, and it could get the control of the municipality. On Thursday, the high court stayed the disqualification proceedings against the councillor scheduled before the urban development minister Milind Naik in Vasco. Madkar was defeated by 7-0 as the councillors from BJP-led panel didn’t attend the special meeting held to discuss the motion. In the 13-member council, before the byelection in ward no 9, both BJP and congress had equal numbers. After the results, Congress-backed candidate won, and their tally went up to seven. Dasharat Ajgaonkar, the candidate backed by Sawant lost to Rajendra Amreshkar of Congress-backed panel by a margin of 17 votes. A day before the scheduled no-confidence motion, the high court of Bombay at Goa stayed the disqualification proceedings against Parsekar before the minister for urban development Milind Naik on Thursday afternoon and sought a reply from him. In 2018, the camp headed by Dharmesh Saglani had formed the first council of their tenure with nine of its councillors besides an independent. Later, two councillors from his faction moved to the Sawant camp, but the council continued to be retained by the former.  Few days later, three more councillors moved to the Sawant camp, while one from Sawant’s panel switched over. However, Sawant-backed panel formed the council. Since November, following Damodar Ghadi’s death, both sides had six councillors each. There was also a long delay in holding the bypolls. The opposition had moved no-trust even before the bypoll was held. After the byelection, the ruling BJP included former chairperson Madkar and councillors Brahma Desai, Shubhada Sawaikar, Anand Kanekar, Dayanand Boryekar and Rashmi while the opposition had deputy chairperson Ansira Khan, Jyoti Blaggaon, Raya Parsekar, Rajesh Sawal, Kunda Madkar and Amreshkar besides Saglani. Speaking to mediapersons after the victory, Saglani who headed the Congress panel said that Goa is witnessing a dictatorship and BJP is not in favour of democracy. He also said that during the last eight days, BJP created trouble for the panel by making false allegations. “BJP is trying to send clear message to public that they want to create the atmosphere of fear,” he said. “Wait for the next assembly . Bear the pain, quietly vote against Sawant,” Saglani said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-loses-civic-bodyhold-on-his-home-turf/articleshow/82108862.cms||---

Addressing the media after an almost five-hour interrogation at VACB special cell office at Thondayad, Shaji said that he has provided some documents to VACB to prove the source of the money. “I have records to prove the source of the money which was collected from the public for election purposes including minutes of meeting, counterfoil, receipts, etc. We have to collect counterfoils from 154 booth committees and that is why I have sought a week’s time,” he said. Shaji said that IUML leadership has made it clear that it had allowed him to collect funds for elections as party state secretary and as per party procedure if excess money was collected, it will be given to the party and if there was a shortfall, the party would give the required sum. He is learnt to have provided the minutes of party meeting which authorized him to collect funds for campaign in his constituency and also the details of salary and other benefits he received as MLA. Shaji said that he hadn’t completed payments for election expenses and added that the money seized by VACB included part of the over Rs 30 lakh which he had the right to spend for his election campaign. He said that he kept the money at his Kannur residence as he had documents to provide its source. Shaji added that VACB returned gold and foreign currencies just after the raid. Foreign currencies were collected by my children from around 20 countries, he added. He refuted reports that money was found concealed in the toilet and said that money was kept beneath his bed in his camp house in Kannur. Vigilance raids at my homes is part of the political hounding I have been facing over the past three years, he added. VACB had registered a case against Shaji after a preliminary inquiry found that he had amassed wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income from 2011 to 2020 by a margin of 166%. The inquiry was on the basis of the petition by advocate MR Harish before the Court of enquiry commissioner and special judge, Kozhikode.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/seized-rs-47l-meant-for-poll-purposes-shaji-tells-vacb/articleshow/82108120.cms||---

A resident of Delhi’s Pandav Nagar, Shashank had launched a web portal three months ago. He was driving from Delhi to UP’s Jalaun on his bike when the accident took place. His mother, Seema Pathak, said Shashank had decided to drive down to Jalaun in his own vehicle as he wanted to avoid public transport due to the prevailing Covid situation. The deceased’s friend, Gurpreet, said he was coming to Jalaun to meet his family members and friends. In charge of Bajna police post Sandeep Chaudhary told TOI that the accident took place around 9 am after the bike rammed into a moving truck on the expressway. He suspects that the two-wheeler driver fell asleep. He died before reaching the hospital, he added.

---||India||To ramp up vaccine output, government pumps in funds||NEW DELHI: In a move to boost India's vaccine capacity, the Centre is extending financial assistance by way of grants to Bharat Biotech and Indian Immunologicals in Hyderabad, Haffekine Biopharma in Mumbai and Bharat Immunologicals in Bulandshahr while setting aside another Rs 200 crore for Covaxin alone. The Bharat Biotech and Haffekine facilities are to receive grants of Rs 65 crore each. A separate support of Rs 200 crore is intended to increase Covaxin production from 1 crore doses a month to around 6 crore a month by August and 10 crore a month by September, which will mark a big step up. The Haffekine facility is expected to produce around 1.5 crore shots by August and 2 crore a month in six months. Sources said an inter-ministerial group for capacity augmentation has engaged indigenous manufacturers for rapid scale up of vaccine production, tying up cooperation with private and public sector entities. The decision to accelerate cooperation with the private sector in view of the unprecedented coronavirus crisis was taken at a meeting chaired by PM Narendra Modi in May last year where he is understood to have asked officials to consider private firms as partners. The government should be an investor and incubator for vaccine development and remove red tape, the PM had said. ICMR provided Rs 10 crore assistance to Serum Institute of India for conducting trials of Covishield vaccine and also extended Rs 10 crore to SII for Covovax (Novovax) trials. Similarly, it gave Rs 30 crore to Bharat Biotech for Covaxin trials and financial assistance was also given to Zydus Cadilla for pre-clinical animal trials. The department of biotechnology and PSU Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council are supporting nearly 15 vaccine candidates with Rs 100 crore. Under a Rs 900 crore programme, five vaccine candidates in advanced clinical development and 19 trial sites are receiving assistance. Three immunogenicity assay labs and three other facilities are also benefiting under this mission. The Centre's assistance to the private sector has also come by way of institutional support in setting up 11 clinical trial sites with a cohort of 50,000-1,00,000 volunteers each. Government labs are involved in generating animal models for SARS-CoV-2 and the immunoassay labs are critical to vaccine development. Government labs have shared sequencing data related to coronavirus with private vaccine developers, saving time and expense. The Central Drugs Standard Organisation has worked to expedite vaccine development by enabling stockpiling even when a candidate is at the clinical trial stage, accelerated and rolling reviews, close cooperation with international regulators and other measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/to-ramp-up-vaccine-output-government-pumps-in-funds/articleshow/82110106.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Buffer stocks of wood at ghats as Covid-19 deaths mount||NEW DELHI: With the number of Covid deaths on the rise, the city’s crematoria are creating buffer stock of wood to meet the increased demand. The cremation grounds at Nigambodh Ghat and Punjabi Bagh — which handle the bulk of Covid-protocol funerals — have stockpiles now to deal with the growing number of the specially designated final rites. Nigambodh Ghat has 8,000 quintals of wood, while Punjabi Bagh has 5,000 quintals wood. An official at the latter facility said that another 4,000 quintals are at hand to replenish the stock. Each traditional cremation consumes 4-5 quintals of wood. Both these crematoria are also equipped with CNG furnaces. A civic official said that much of the wood for pyres in Delhi comes from the Garhganga-Hasanpur belt in Uttar Pradesh. “Yes, our supply may be impacted if Covid cases continue to rise in that belt,” admitted the official. “So, we are keeping a close eye on the supply chain.” Officials of the NGO managing the Nigambodh Ghat facility said that there were 120 pyre platforms there, with around 110 used daily. “On Wednesday, 107 bodies were cremated, of which 34 were of Covid patients. We had 46 Covid bodies on Thursday and the number is steadily rising. We have to manage the non-Covid cremations too,” one official said. The number of last rites performed at Nigambodh Ghat has risen steadily, from 78 (24 Covid) on April 11 to 89 (22 Covid) a day later. ON April 13, there were 99 cremations 107 on April 14. The NGO official said that adequate wood stocks had been provisioned for 2,000 cremations, while a crematorium manager added, “Our wood warehouse is full and the contractors are regularly replenishing the stock. A direct CNG line is available for the six gas furnaces.” The CNG furnaces can take care of four bodies a day, while the traditional pyre platform is used for one body per day. A civic official said wood is stocked before the monsoons to take advantage of the availability of dry firewood. “Some cremation grounds faced problems in procuring wood during the lockdown last year. We are trying to take adequate precautions this year to avoid such problems,” the official said. EDMC has so far carried out a total of 1,958 Covid cremations. EDMC mayor Nirmal Jain said that one CNG unit would be kept aside for Covid bodies at Karkardooma cremation ground from Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/buffer-stocks-of-wood-at-ghats-as-deaths-mount/articleshow/82108879.cms||Paras Singh

---||Agra||Hospitals, crematoriums inundated in Agra||AGRA: Hospitals were crammed with patients, crematoriums with the dead in many major cities of western Uttar Pradesh, including Agra. The number of confirmed Covid-19 cases touched another high on Friday and so did serious patients. In Agra, health authorities said that two people have died during treatment. But a few kilometers away, at the crematorium, people were made to wait for over three hours before they could cremate their loved ones. At Covid hospitals in Agra, ICU beds were full. On the fourth consecutive day, Covid-19 set a new record in Agra. At least, 346 people were tested Covid-19 positive in the district within 24 hours, the highest ever. The number of active cases soared to 1,568. The emergency ward at the SN Medical College remained fully occupied with two patients each on several beds. Crucial Remdesivir injection and plasma ran out of stock. And oxygen too. In the last two days, over 36 ambulances have stopped operations due to lack of oxygen. And those still running have increased their charges by 30%. State secretary of ambulance owners-drivers association Ravi Sishodiya said, “The rate of oxygen cylinders has doubled in the last one week. To cover the cost of oxygen, we have no other option except to charge patients extra. Authorities must ensure adequate supply of oxygen in the market and see to it that price is regulated.” Private hospitals were also suffering from shortage of oxygen. Doctors are considering using industrial oxygen for treatment of patients in critical condition. In Meerut, too, the health infrastructure was bursting at the seams. The number of Covid-19 cases touched an all-time high of 595 in the last 24 hours. And one patient succumbed. It prompted Meerut district magistrate K Balaji to appeal to shopkeepers of the district to willingly close markets for three days in a week to curb the spread of the virus. The number of bodies reaching crematoriums has also seen a marked jump. A caretaker of Agra’s Tajganj crematorium said, “On average, 15 bodies used to be cremated daily here. In the last 24 hours, over 40 bodies have arrived for cremation. We have asked family members of the deceased to wait as vacant space is not available for cremation.” Asked about the gap between the number of deaths being reported at the hospitals and bodies reaching crematoriums, Agra’s chief medical officer Dr RC Pandey said, “In last 48 hours, only two Covid-19 patients have died in Agra district. The increase in the number of bodies reaching crematoriums is due to other reasons.” IMA president of Agra district, Dr Rajeev Upadhyaya said, “Agra district is facing the worst phase of the Covid-19 pandemic. Beds in all designated Covid-19 hospitals are fully occupied. People should religiously follow Covid-19 appropriate behavior. Wearing masks and maintaining social distancing is the best prevention from the disease.” District magistrate Prabhu N Singh said, “There is no shortage of oxygen supply at the government centers. We will ensure private hospitals, nursing homes and ambulances do not suffer from a short supply of oxygen.” “Following sudden increase in the number of Covid-19 cases, three has been stress on the health infrastructure. IMA is coordinating with us. We are in the process of increasing ICU beds. The central government has already banned export of Remdesivir injection. We will be getting adequate supply of the drug in the next 2-3 days. The state government is working in this regard,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/hospitals-crematoriums-inundated-in-agra/articleshow/82107408.cms||Deepak Lavania

With only people exempted from the weekend curfew allowed to travel by the Metro or other modes of public transport, the trains will be available at a frequency of 15 minutes across most of the network. “In view of the curfew imposed by the government for the coming weekend for containing Covid-19, Metro services will be available with a headway of 15 minutes across the whole network on the weekend i.e. on April 17 and 18,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director of corporate communications at Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC). On Blue Line, however, trains will be available at a frequency of 30 minutes from Yamuna Bank station till Noida Electronic City and Vaishali, and vice-versa. The same rule will be applicable on the Kirti Nagar/Inderlok stretch of Green Line. While Metro trains are available at a frequency of 2 minutes and 44 seconds during peak rush hours on weekdays on busy corridors like Yellow Line (Samaypur Badli-HUDA City Centre), the usual frequency is 2 minutes 58 seconds on weekends. The maximum gap between train services ranges between 16 and 18 minutes on some sections. A spokesperson of Delhi Transport Corporation said it would operate its buses as per the usual weekend schedule. It is expected that Cluster Scheme buses will also be available as per its usual schedule. Public transport such as Delhi Metro, public buses, autorickshaws and taxis have been allowed to function during the weekend curfew, but only for transportation of those in the exempted categories and following Covid-safety protocols. DMRC said entry to the Metro from 10pm on Friday to 5am on Monday would be allowed only to those passengers falling in the essential category as per the government order, after verification of their valid IDs by DMRC or Central Industrial Security Force personnel. Similarly, valid IDs or e-passes of those travelling by buses will be checked by bus marshals or conductors before they are allowed to board a vehicle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/metro-to-run-at-reduced-frequency/articleshow/82108880.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Prima facie robbery is the motive behind the murder. Ratanaben Jain She is the second senior citizen killed this year. In February, 79-year-old Vishni Dolwani was found murdered in her bungalow at Worli Sea Face; her two newly-recruited servants were arrested. Bhandup police registered a murder case and crime branch is conducting a parallel probe. She was found murdered in her house at Phoogawala compound on Friday afternoon though the murder probably took place between 6am-noon. Ratanaben is survived by her married daughter Dimple Shah, who stays nearby. Police said Ratanaben has been staying alone for 30 years. Her murder came to light after her domestic maid Harshad Ahire visited her for household chores. She found Ratanaben lying in a pool of blood with her throat slit open. She alerted neighbours and Bhandup police. Dimple told police her mother’s gold bangles, gold chain, earrings and rings were missing. Police said the safe had around Rs 3 lakh. Neighbours and witnesses have not provided leads and police said due to lockdown no one noticed who visited her. In Jogeshwari, a man impersonated a courier boy and robbed a housewife at knifepoint. Police said such incidents are increasing in the last month as petty robbers and house-breakers are finding it difficult to make ends meet as most members of the family are in the house due to lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-senior-citizen-murdered-rs-3-5-lakh-gold-missing/articleshow/82108886.cms||Ahmed Ali

A circular issued by NU Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable states that colleges would be conducting the first semester exams for failure students in online and offline mode in the same period. Sable has asked principals, heads of departments, directors, teachers and other officials from affiliated colleges to begin preparations. If colleges hold online exams then they should include multiple-choice questions, fill in the blanks and match the following. “All online papers would be conducted on Google Form and all questions should be made mandatory for examinees.

---||Nagpur||Amid O2 crisis, demand, prices of oxygen concentrators soar||NAGPUR: The shortage of oxygen in hospitals has led to a rush for oxygen concentrator machines. The equipment that can be kept at home is being seen as a handy life-saving device. Resembling a suitcase, it costs as much as a 52-inch smart TV or a home theatre system, yet the machine is selling like hot cakes these days. The machine filters oxygen from the air in the room, which can be administered to the patient. Prior to the pandemic each dealer sold not more than 5-6 units in a month. The machines were needed for patients with severe respiratory illness. The buying prompted by shortage of oxygen, has in a little more than a week led to a dearth of oxygen concentrator machines also. TOI talked to four major dealers for oxygen concentrators in the city. Each said they had run out of stock. The next consignment would at least take a week or even more, said the market sources. The shortage has led to an increase in the rates also. The machines come in the range of Rs40,000 to Rs70,000 a unit these days. This is a jump of at least Rs10,000 from the earlier rates, said market sources. In some cases the rates have gone up by Rs15,000 too, they said. Dealers said the market depends purely on imports and China is a dominant player. There are manufacturers from the US too. The Chinese machines are available at slightly cheaper rates as compared to the American models, said market sources. Dealers said China had emerged as a hub of manufacturing. There are factories in China which make the machines on order for different brands selling in India, said a dealer. The fresh demand can only be met when the consignments arrive, said traders. “There was no demand for the machines during the first wave but now there is a rush for the machines. I have got almost 100 calls in a day but have run out of stock and am helpless,” said Sanjay Khawtekar of M/s RS Meditech in the city. Consumers have given advance money for the machines. So as the fresh stock arrives they will get the first priority, he said. “As a business it may be profitable indeed, but this has also left me frustrated. Its unbearable to see people plead,” said Khawtekar. Apart from individual consumers there was demand from hospitals too, he said. Padmakar Ganvir of NL Meditech said there was no stock at his place too. A large number of cases are being reported in other towns of the region also. This has led to a sudden demand for the machines. Ganvir said the market largely depends on China and there is no Indian manufacturer for the product. “There may be some machines built on American designs but even for that mass manufacturing happens in China,” he said. American brand Philips dealer Ashish Pandey, who has also run out of stock, said the sudden demand of machines has also led to rates being jacked up. “A section of the business community is trying to make the most of the situation. However, the increase in dollar rates is also one of the reasons for the fresh stock to be costlier,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/amid-o2-crisis-demand-prices-of-oxygen-concentrators-soar/articleshow/82108900.cms||Shishir Arya

The two policemen involved in the racket have been identified as Amjed and Raiszaada, who were posted in the anti-drug task force in Haridwar. Both used to provide tip-off to the members of the drug peddlers before police raids. DGP Uttarakhand Ashok Kumar said there are enough proofs against both constables and the police department is going to initiate the process of their termination from service. Acting on a tip-off, the joint team conducted a raid and arrested the kingpin of the drug racket, Sattaar, from the Bahadarabad area of Haridwar. Sattaar is a history-sheeter and there are almost 38 criminal cases registered against him in Jwalapur police station of Haridwar. "Another accused Rahil was held from Jwalapur. The police seized 189 grams of smack worth Rs 8 lakh from his possession. He told the police that the two policemen used to help them in running the drug racket in Haridwar," said Nilesh Bharne, DIG, STF. On the basis of information provided by Sattaar and Rahil, a team of STF sleuths also arrested a woman named Gangesh. Police seized 1.25 kg charas from her possession. Yet another accused Irfan was also held for his involvement in the drug racket, added the senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/two-cops-among-six-arrested-under-narcotics-act/articleshow/82107431.cms||Gaurav Talwar

The Sector 48 hospital should function as an exclusive Covid hospital, he ordered. He further directed all hospitals to store enough oxygen and adequate vaccines along with required medicines. He said mobile testing teams should be sent to temples, gurdwaras, mosques and other crowded places during festival season, so that visitors could be screened and symptomatic cases tested. He also suggested that all shops must get their staff tested. He said action will be taken against not only the shoppers who go to markets without wearing masks but also against those shopkeepers who attend to non-wearing masks customers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/city-goes-under-weekend-lockdown/articleshow/82107419.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The lynching took place during the country-wide lockdown on April 16, 2020. Kalpavriksha Giri Maharaj (70), Sushil Giri Maharaj (35) and their driver Nilesh Telgade (30) were headed to Surat in Gujarat to attend a funeral. They were travelling in a car from Kandivli. They took the road that passed the Gadchinchale village in Kasa. Men who were patrolling the area, following rumours that a child kidnapping gang was active in the region, intercepted the car around 9.30 pm. A huge mob gathered and many among them lynched the three. A day after the crime 154 tribals were arrested. Following nationwide criticism of the police inaction in dealing with the lynching, the case was handed over to the state CID. It has now emerged that one of the prime accused (accused number 24) was a minor when the lynching took place. In February, the father of the accused produced his age proof showing he was to turn 18 on July 19, 2020. Advocate Amrut Adhikari told TOI an application has been filed before Thane special court to consider the accused as a minor and send him to Children’s Remand Home in Bhiwandi. He is a Class XI student. — Sandhya Nair||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-a-year-on-1-key-palghar-case-accused-turns-out-to-be-minor/articleshow/82108883.cms||Sandhya Nair

He had come to his native village to vote in the panchayat polls and was on his way back to Delhi when the tragedy struck. Agitated residents in the village blocked the Pinhat-Rajakhera road demanding action against the electricity department officials for their negligence. BJP MLA Rani Pakshalika Singh reached the spot with power department officials and assured them that action will be taken in the matter. Talking to TOI, student Kuldeep Tomar’s father Kishan Pal Singh, who lives in Delhi’s Durga Vihar and works as an electrical contractor, said that Kuldeep was pursuing a distant learning MBA. He added that seven members of his family came to the village on April 14 for casting their votes in the panchayat elections and were returning after the polls on Thursday when the incident took place around 9:45 pm. “Many passengers, including my family and I, boarded the bus. When Kuldeep was stepping on the bus stairs, the bus moved a bit and my son was electrocuted as a high-tension wire touched the vehicle. My daughter-in-law and her 2-year-old daughter were also injured,” he said, adding that bus driver immediately moved forward and saved the other passengers. They were immediately taken to hospital. Kuldeep could not survive while the other two are under treatment at a private hospital in Shamshabad, he said, adding that a complaint has been given to the police. Superintendent of police (East) K Venkat Ashok said that an FIR has been registered at Mansukhpura police station against the electricity department under sections 304-A (causing death by negligence) and 338 (whoever causes grievous hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life) of IPC on a complaint filed by the deceased’s father.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/mba-student-from-delhi-electrocuted-to-death-as-bus-touches-high-tension-wire/articleshow/82107440.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Delhi||Covid funerals reach almost half of capacity, 3 main sites bear brunt||New Delhi: Crematoria and burial grounds in the city continued to see rising number of funerals conducted with Covid protocols, with 181 such cases on Thursday. This is almost half of the maximum capacity reserved for Covid funerals, as civic bodies have arranged for 400 cremations per day. However, if the numbers continue to rise, corporations will have to link smaller crematoria with hospitals to reduce load on the key facilities. Three major cremation grounds are taking the bulk of the load, with Nigambodh Ghat under North Delhi Municipal Corporation holding 46 Covid-protocol funerals on Thursday, Punjabi Bagh under South Delhi Municipal Corporation conducting 37 and Seemapuri under East Delhi Municipal Corporation handling 19 bodies. Jai Prakash, north corporation mayor, said that in wake of the increased rush, half of the 120 funeral pyres in the city’s biggest crematorium at Nigambodh Ghat have been reserved for Covid funerals. “Two different sections have been carved out to stop intermixing of people. Half of Nigambodh Ghat’s platforms and CNG furnaces will be used for bodies requiring Covid protocol,” Prakash said, adding that if the demand increases, more centres will be supplemented to the list. Reports from civic bodies show that north corporation received 75 such bodies, SDMC conducted funerals for 77 cases and EDMC saw 29 cases on Thursday. Under north corporation, Nigambodh saw 46 bodies, 10 at Panchkuiyan Road, five in Beri Wala Bagh ground, three in Wazirpur and 11 in Mangolpuri. The Mangolpuri facility has provision for cremations and Muslim and Christian cemeteries. At Nigambodh, 20 bodies were cremated using CNG facilities and 26 using traditional wood pyres. An SDMC official said that the 77 Covid funerals were conducted at seven facilities under the civic body — 37 went to Punjabi Bagh, 11 in Hastsal, five in Sector 24 Dwarka, 15 at Lodhi Road, among other units. The corporation also stated that 55 bodies were received on Wednesday. “Sometimes, it takes a day or two for hospital mortuaries to release the bodies. All cremations are not carried out on same day,” an official explained. Under existing norms, SDMC has 260 funeral pyres, north corporation has 106 and EDMC has 35 pyres for Covid funerals. EDMC plans to open a CNG furnace in Karkardooma next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-funerals-reach-almost-half-of-capacity-3-main-sites-bear-brunt/articleshow/82108906.cms||Paras Singh
---||Agra||Migrants return in droves to UP villages, no arrangement for screening, quarantine yet||AGRA: Despite the Uttar Pradesh government's strict orders on Thursday to set up Covid quarantine centres for screening of incoming migrants and other visitors, local authorities are yet to make any such arrangement leading to fears among the residents of a wider spread of the virus in the state. Covid cases in the state have already surpassed a record 27,000 in the last 24 hours. Droves of migrant workers - fearful of another lockdown - are returning to UP daily from other Covid-affected states such as Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Delhi. Some of them returning via trains are getting down in Agra. On state authorities' instructions, UP Roadways in Agra region have deployed 100 buses at railway stations to ferry them home. These buses are ferrying both migrant workers as well as the regular passengers. But, none of them are being tested for Covid, so far. The state had directed local authorities to screen migrants, record their details and quarantine them. In fact, most of them walked out of the railway stations without even preliminary checks. When contacted, Agra district chief medical officer (CMO) Dr RC Pandey said, “No data of migrants returning from other states was recorded on Friday. We are still in the process of setting up quarantine centres. Village monitoring committees have been activated. They will record details of people returning from other states. Necessary measures are being taken for implementation of the government orders." Migrant workers on their way back to the home state are narrating tales quite similar to those of March-April 2020. Pramod Kumar, a Firozabad district resident who had returned from Karnataka via train on Friday morning, said, “I used to work as a carpenter in Bengaluru. There is no work now. To avoid being stuck in another lockdown, I decided to return with my 12 other friends. We will stay in the village till the situation is normal." Mohammad Arif, a resident of Aligarh who works at construction sites in Maharashtra had just returned from Mumbai. “The situation in Mumbai is getting worse every day. At least I won't have to sleep hungry in my village. My other friends are still stuck in Maharashtra." Meanwhile, UPSRTC regional manager Manoj Pundhir said, “Over 100 buses have been deployed at major terminals in Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan to bring the workers back. We are trying to send the workers to their home districts. All the passengers are strictly told to wear face masks." There is, however, not much clarity on screening, quarantine facilities or any specific instructions to reduce the number of passengers on the buses. "At present, we are operating the buses at full seating capacity," Pundhir added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/migrants-return-in-droves-to-up-villages-no-arrangement-for-screening-quarantine-yet/articleshow/82107443.cms||Deepak Lavania

Dr Shawarbi is the head of the neurosurgery department and also the medical director for the neuroscience department at Burjeel Hospital. When contacted, Nandakumar said that Ali will be spending one more week at the hospital. “Currently, he is undergoing the post-surgery procedures, which includes physiotherapy,” he added. On Sunday, an Agusta Westland AW109 helicopter that carried Ali, wife, two secretaries and two pilots, was forced to execute an emergency landing at a vacant marshy plot near the NH bypass at Panangad in Kochi. At a height of 200 ft and only 1.5km short of destination, the operating engine had stopped working. As it was flying really low, the pilots couldn’t revive the helicopter using the second engine. Hence, the chopper did a belly-landing amid adverse weather. Just after the rescue operations by the neighbours and the police, it was reported that Ali had complained of back pain and had initially refused to sit on a chair provided by one of his saviours. Dr Shamsheer VP, son-in-law of Ali and owner of Burjeel Hospital, has been leading the entire operation from the front. Nandakumar said the royalty across the Middle East had been wishing Ali a speedy recovery. They include Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of UAE and Ruler of Dubai and Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of UAE armed forces. From India, Ajith Doval, national security advisor, Government of India, and V Muraleedharan, minister of state for external affairs had enquired about his well-being, Nandakumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/yusuff-ali-undergoes-spinal-surgery/articleshow/82108179.cms||Shenoy Karun

These will be transported under the Roll on Roll Off (RO-RO) scheme, which means the trucks loaded with liquid medical oxygen in cryogenic tanks will be put on the railway wagons for quick movement. The railway ministry conveyed the decision to all its general managers across zones and this arrangement will be allowed till October 15, 2021. Cryogenic tanks are used for the storage of liquids such as oxygen, argon, nitrogen, hydrogen and helium. Maharashtra has been battling to get adequate liquid medical oxygen to meet the demand due to the spike in Covid cases. The demand is also high in neighbouring Gujarat and other states are likely to see similar situations because of high numbers of infections.The Railway Board has laid down the specifications about the payload and other aspects to operationalise the mechanism for quick transportation of the liquid medical oxygen. It said the railways won’t levy busy season charge and development charge for such consignments. Two persons will be allowed to accompany the trucks and including the driver and they will need to carry second class tickets for the journey. The consigner will take precautions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/rlys-approves-states-request-to-transport-oxygen-tankers/articleshow/82108903.cms||Dipak K Dash

A first time for her but not the last, if need be, she said, adding every dead person deserves respect. Talking with TOI, constable Verma, who hails from Bulandshahr’s Khurja, said the body was decomposed and, hence, she cremated it herself. The priest at the crematorium tried to stop her from lighting the pyre of the unidentified woman but she argued and managed to get her way. “Everybody should be cremated respectfully whether it is known or unidentified and that is what I did,” said Verma. She added that earlier she had been infected with Covid-19 and that is why she did not fear performing the last rites in these times of crisis. Moved by reports on television that showed families reluctant to cremate their loved ones due to fear of the Covid infection, Verma said, “I would never say no.” A postgraduate in Economics from Khurja, Verma said there is a need to change the conservative mindset of society that last rites cannot be performed by a woman or they cannot visit a cremation ground, “I have read books and the fact is that women don’t visit a crematorium ground because of fear,” she said. She cited the example of Lord Ram’s wife Sita offering “pinda” on the banks of river Phalgu to Dasharatha (Ram’s father) and asked, “Then why can't women cremate bodies?” The daughter of a farmer, Verma joined the police force in 2016 and after training, she was posted in Kosi Kalan in September 2017. She has a younger sister who is pursuing her post-graduation from her hometown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/woman-cop-fights-opposition-by-priest-to-light-pyre-of-unidentified-woman/articleshow/82107446.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Kolkata||Edu institutes going back to online mode||Kolkata: Schools, colleges and universities have asked teachers to resume work from home like last year following the sharp rise in Covid cases. With three city school heads and several teachers in almost every city school being affected by Covid, the schools affiliated to CISCE and CBSE asked teachers to refrain from coming to the campus and continue with online teaching from home. Only a few schools, where the board practical examinations are not yet complete, asked teachers to come till they wrapped up the process in a couple of days. In several schools, including Lakshmipat Singhania Academy (LSA), DPS New Town and DPS Ruby Park, the decision to ask teachers to stay at home was taken after several teachers had contracted the virus. Around six teachers and six students have been affected by Covid in LSA. “Last year, we did not have a single case. But in this new wave, many are getting affected. So, I have asked teachers to stay at home,” said the school’s director, Meena Kak. Though none has got affected in Loreto Convent Entally, the principal, Jessica Gomes Surana, has decided not to take a chance and asked teachers to take online classes from home. The new academic session will start from Monday at DPS Newtown, where some teachers have been affected. The school has asked teachers to start the online session from home and not take any risk by coming to the campus, said the principal, Sonali Sen. South City international principal, John Bagul, has asked teachers to attend school on alternate days while La Martiniere for Girls principal, Rupkatha Sarkar, said that a rotational roster had been prepared for teachers. Colleges and universities, too, are taking guard against Covid and have asked teaching staff to work from home. Only a skeletal non-teaching workforce will report to campuses. Some colleges and universities that had granted access to laboratories to the students pursuing post graduation have either stopped coming or are going to do so. Universities and colleges have also started getting the campuses sanitised for the safety of those coming to work which includes vice-chancellors, their deputies, college principals and registrars. “We have returned to work from home arrangement for online classes. From last week professors have stopped coming to the campus because taking public transport might expose them to the virus,” said JD Birla College principal, Deepali Singhee At Bethune, professors were coming to the campus two or three days-a-week. They have been asked to stop coming. Jadavpur University was shut on Friday for the sanitisation of the campus. Several offices within the university have been shut since the beginning of this week after officials tested positive to Covid. On campus classes were suspended in March last year due to the pandemic. The students have not returned to the campus ever since online teaching became a norm. Universities and colleges gradually started calling their staffers to work for several non-academic work. “With cases rising so rapidly, we cannot take further risks.

The commission, which had decided to investigate into the complaint, has asked the varsity to submit the facts and information on the action taken on the allegations/matters within 15 days. In his complaint, K Pramod, post-doctoral fellow at IIT, Madras, said that while the UGC strictly says that the overall selection procedure shall incorporate transparent, objective, and credible methodology of analysis of the merits and credentials of the applicants based on weightages given to the performance of the candidate in different relevant dimensions and his/her performance on a grading system performa, the interview board did not follow the assessment criteria and methodology and violated the UGC regulations. “I felt that the university and its selection committee, which are illegally violating the UGC norms and rules, were seen as legitimizing the explicit propaganda of nepotism,” he said, adding that the selection process never seemed transparent. “Despite having good academic and research records, I was never sincerely interviewed with a transparent, objective, and credible methodology of analysis to assess my merits and credentials,” he added. Pramod further said that CU has issued the appointment notice without specifying the reservation posts and also, the roster has not been made public even at the time of appointment. “The backlogs of the scheduled castes were left unfilled. These violate UGC norms and regulations and the constitutional rights of scheduled caste candidates. So, I kindly request that the present appointments be cancelled and conducted again by an unbiased-neutral committee complying with the UGC reservation rules and regulations,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/sc-commission-seeks-report-from-calicut-university/articleshow/82108182.cms||---

The sanitizer was packed in 41 plastic cans of five litres each. Anshuman Sharma, a city trader who deals in medical supplies had raised requisition of sanitizers from a Ghaziabad-based firm. "A sales representative came to the house in the morning claiming to be from a firm in Ghaziabad. He showed a sample of the sanitizer and after testing, I placed an order for 60 cans,” Sharma said. However, Sharma became suspicious after he did not get a proper invoice for the product and alerted the local law enforcing agencies. "He (salesman) delivered 41 cans and took payment for it. When I asked for an invoice, he said he would give it when he delivered the remaining 19 cans of sensitizer. I have been trying to reach him but he is not returning my calls," Sharma said. The excise department in its primary probe claimed that the firm from which the purchase was made does not exist in Ghaziabad. "Any firm producing sanitizer is registered with us.

---||Meerut||Dead or behind the bars, notorious criminals continue to wield influence in panchayat polls in pockets of Uttar Pradesh||MEERUT: Killed in police encounters or serving prison terms, the sway of criminals in western Uttar Pradesh pockets refuses to wane in their absence. And their clout continues to help their close relatives clinch local elections amid simultaneous police crackdown. In Baghpat, mothers of two slain criminals, Rahul Khatta of Khatta village and Pramod Gangnauli of Gangnauli village, had comfortably won 2016 panchayat polls. This time, their other relatives are in the fray. Similarly, dreaded criminal Dharmender Kirthal’s wife and mom had won panchayat elections last time. “I had left this village in 2013. I used to come here only to cremate a murdered family member,” says Pravesh Kumar, whose parents, a brother and two cousins were allegedly killed by the dreaded Pramod Gangnauli gang. Pravesh, an Army man, returned home last year after a police crackdown on the criminal and his gang members. He took this call after the arrest of a dreaded criminal, Praveen Rathi, of the Gangnauli gang in September last year. As the panchayat polls drew closer, the administration and the police in the districts of western UP launched a crackdown against all the anti-social elements and tried to instill confidence among people to freely exercise their franchise. District magistrate of Baghpat, Raj Kamal Yadav, said, “We are keeping a strict vigil. No one will be allowed to threaten or coerce people into voting in their favour. For instance we have attached properties of 10 gangsters or their relatives. We have invoked UP Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986 against family members of Rahul Khatta, Pramod Gangnauli, Sunil Rathi, Dharmender Kirthal, etc. and have attached their properties. In fact, award has been announced against Kirthal and combing operations are also on. None of his family members are fighting polls this time.” Kirthal of Ramala region has gone into hiding and none of his family members are contesting elections this time. Last time, his mother and wife had won panchayat polls. “79 people with criminal antecedents have been externed from the district,” the DM said. “We are in the process of installing CCTV cameras in the shortlisted villages. A dedicated team will monitor every activity of the candidates roaming about these villages,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/dead-or-behind-the-bars-notorious-criminals-continue-to-wield-influence-in-panchayat-polls-in-pockets-of-up/articleshow/82107463.cms||Sandeep Rai

In the second wave of coronavirus which has been creating a havoc in congested areas of Udhna, Limbayat and central zones, these areas have seen a respite, though in last one month the posh zones saw an increase of 42.87% in number of cases. Covid-19 cases have increased exponentially in the congested areas during the same period with Athwa, Rander and Katargam zones constituting 50.9% of the total 1,521 new cases reported even on Thursday. Cases have increased by 53.81% in areas of these three zones. The fresh cases pushed the total to 63,141 in the city so far, a spike of 46.91%. “Last year, people living in Athwa and other areas were infected the most due to travelling and weddings outside. This time the virus is not finding many people to infect here. On the other hand, Udhna, Limbayat and central zone areas are dense and people too live in congested conditions,” said Banchha Nidhi Pani, Surat municipal commissioner. He said that it is possible that cases in such areas have increased this time as the economic activities are regular this time around unlike last year’s lockdown. Udhna, Limbayat and central zones house dyeing mills, diamond market, textile market and weaving units. Workers of mills, weaving units and textile markets too live in these areas with many cramped up in small houses or rooms. On Friday, TOI visited the diamond market in Mahidharpura and found the streets and bylanes chock-a-block with people where social distancing norms have been literally thrown to the air. Many had not even worn masks while many were seen wearing it covering their chin or the neck. The textile markets too remain congested throughout the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/insensitivity-pushes-up-covid-cases-in-dense-areas/articleshow/82108272.cms||Jay Pachchigar

As oxygen beds are limited in the city and suppliers are finding it difficult to provide oxygen cylinders on demand, doctors are prescribing oxygen concentrators to many patients. Patients too are buying this machine, which is proving to be life-saver for many. Oxygen concentrators take in air from the room and filter out nitrogen. The process provides a higher amount of oxygen needed for the patient. There are different types and shapes of concentrators – right from large and stationary to small and portable. Concentrators are different than tanks or other containers supplying oxygen because they use electrical pumps to concentrate the continuous supply of oxygen that comes from the surrounding air. “Many a time, post Covid patients are hooked up with 1-2 litres of oxygen and their course is over in hospital. We are discharging such patients with advice to continue oxygen therapy at home and asking them to follow-up online or OPD consultation. This makes them comfortable and also spares Covid beds for the needy,” said Dr Anup Marar, director of Orange City Hospital and Research Institute. According to him, one should avoid keeping oxygen cylinders at home due to its explosive nature and also because it puts the overstretched refilling capacities of vendors in city under stress. “Cylinders should only be reserved for hospitals and oxygen concentrators for home. But the patients using oxygen concentrators should keep windows open so that the nitrogen is flushed out,” he said. Pulmonologist Dr Rajesh Swarnakar, who heads Covid care at Getwell Hospital, said that the device is best to deal with O2 shortage. “As stock of medical oxygen is running out, the machine can be useful for those requiring oxygen up to 5 litres per minute and not above. We have purchased 10 machines for our hospital,” he said. He made it clear that concentrator should be prescribed by a treating doctor and not to be taken on empirical basis by patient. Apart from Covid-19, chronic asthma, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the flu are some of the health issues that may cause oxygen levels to drop. The O2 level is checked by a pulse oximeter, which is now a household gadget due to Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/oxygen-concentrators-a-good-option-for-therapy-at-home-doctors/articleshow/82108976.cms||---

The drive was conducted in the wake of the latest surge in Covid cases leading to the state government enforcing strict measures such as partial lockdown and checking drives for face masks. As many as 8,226 were fined in Ghaziabad district in a week between April 9 and 15. This was followed by 3,973 commuters caught without masks in the same period in Baghpat. Checkings were conducted at all major crossings and roads of these districts with teams from police stations in each jurisdiction carrying out the drive apart from raising awareness for the need to practice restraint in stepping out and wearing the face masks properly. With Covid cases growing exponentially, the drive is all set to intensify with a harsher penalty. Those stepping out without masks will be fined Rs 1,000 and a fine of Rs 10,000 will be imposed on someone caught flouting the protocol for the second time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/over-20000-commuters-fined-rs-30-lakh-in-meerut-range-for-not-wearing-mask/articleshow/82107521.cms||---

It was the first day of the Covid-19 sample testing. Started with a capacity of 100 tests a day, the microbiology laboratory here caters to four districts of western Uttar Pradesh: Meerut, Shamli, Muzaffarnagar and Bijnor. With Covid-19 cases soaring almost every day and the second wave hitting even harder, the laboratory has upgraded its capacity of testing to a whopping 7,000 samples a day. A lot has changed though. Earlier, laboratory technicians had started living away from their families to ensure that they did not spread the virus. Over a year after the Covid-19 breakout, they go back home every day but with a fear that they might infect someone at home. The staff strength has been increased by four more technicians and two more machines have been installed. What remains the same is that the laboratory on the second floor of LLRM Medical College is frequented by doctors and technicians 24x7. “The laboratory had started with the capacity of 100 samples. The state government has increased the capacity of sample testing, which has now risen to 7,000 because the number of cases have started rising again. The technicians are working 24x7 because we are overloaded with work,” said Dr Amit Garg, head, microbiology department, LLRM Medical College. The laboratory had started functioning in March 2020 and reduced the time required for testing of the samples. “The staff number has increased as four more technicians have been added to the existing staff. We had one machine to conduct RT-PCR tests, but now, the number has increased to three. One batch of samples takes at least five hours -- to be extracted and tested. And at a time, 96 samples can be tested in one machine. The increase in the capacity is indeed a challenge but we need to continuously do the testing due to the increasing cases,” said Dr Garg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/now-llrms-microbio-lab-can-test-7000-samples-a-day-for-covid-19/articleshow/82107486.cms||Ishita Bhatia

He has isolated himself at his residence. His family members have tested negative. The police department carried out a sanitisation drive in his office at the police headquarters, Sector 9. Baniwal, who had inaugurated the vaccination drive for cops at the police hospital in police lines , Sector 26 on February 3, was the first to take the shot. After the gap of the scheduled number of six weeks, he took the second shot in the second week of March. As many as 5,975 cops have taken vaccine till March 31, while 777 could not do so owing to some health issues. A total of 127 cops refused to take the jab in the first phase. A total of 260 cops— 25 in the last month — have tested positive so far, according to police department data. As many as 253 cops have fully recovered, while seven are still in quarantine.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 46 patients shifted as BMC hospital short of oxygen||MUMBAI: As oxygen shortage hit civic-run Bhagwati Hospital on Friday, 46 Covid positive patients had to be shifted out of the Borivli hospital to three other municipal facilities. Civic authorities said that the hospital didn’t get its regular fill of oxygen on time and hence moved out the patients before the stocks ran out. Of the 46 patients, 25 were moved to the Dahisar jumbo hospital, 10 to Bal Thackeray Trauma Hospital in Jogeshwari and 11 to Babasaheb Ambedkar hospital in Kandivli. Dr P Jadhav, chief superintendent of peripheral hospitals, confirmed that the patients had to be shifted on account of oxygen shortage. “Bhagwati Hospital didn’t get their regular oxygen supply on Friday, so we decided to shift the relatively stable patients before the stocks ran dry,” he said. The shifting of patients began around noon and went on till 4pm. The hospital is believed to have 10 dura cylinders as well as jumbo cylinders. Dr Jadhav said they were mobilising oxygen supply so that other patients are not affected. Last week, several private hospitals were hit by a similar shortage, forcing families to desperately look for beds with available oxygen supply. As the oxygen shortage gets more acute in the state —Maharashtra is consuming 1,500 metric tonnes against its daily production of 1,250 metric tonnes—the supply could get more erratic. Dr Deepa Shriyan, dean of Dahisar jumbo hospital, said all 25 patients who have been shifted from Bhagwati were stable. “The demand for oxygen has grown exponentially. In the Dahisar jumbo facility, the number of beds has remained the same, but the oxygen demand has tripled in the second wave,” she said. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra alleged that the BMC had failed to manage oxygen supply. “There is total chaos as far as bed management and oxygen supply is concerned. If there is a shortage of oxygen in BMC hospitals, then we can only imagine how bad the situation must be in private hospitals. Shifting patients is dangerous and it’s a big risk to their health,” Mishra said. “The BMC has appointed nodal officers to coordinate oxygen supply, but this should have been done earlier and not after there is a shortage. The corporation must tell us the status of oxygen supply in all its hospitals and not admit patients if there is no supply,” he added. BMC chief I S Chahal had said on Thursday that the city’s 150 Covid hospitals required around 235 metric tonnes of oxygen daily, and that the civic body has asked the state government to provide more oxygen for Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-46-patients-shifted-as-bmc-hosp-short-of-oxygen/articleshow/82108946.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Two arrested on suspicion of poisoning several cattle in Muzaffarnagar||MUZAFFARNAGAR: Two men, who were suspected to be involved in poisoning several cattle and charging hefty sums of money from their owners to dispose of their carcasses, were captured by villagers of Kukra, and handed over to the police. The incident happened in Muzaffarnagar’s New Mandi police station limits on Thursday. The villagers had been on alert for the past one month after a dozen cattle were found dead by poisoning. The villagers claimed that these men would poison their cows and then demand hefty sums of money to dispose of their carcasses. The residents had found them roaming around on their scooter in the village, and when they were confronted, the accused could not explain their presence. They had also found a 'poisonous substance' from them. “They used to charge Rs 2,000 for removing carcasses. As many as 20 cattle were killed in the last several months,” Rajkumar Gupta, a villager, said. After being informed by the villagers, the police rushed to the spot and arrested both. The accused were identified as Inam and Arif, both residents of Khalapar in Muzaffarnagar Both were charged under Indian Penal Code section 429 (mischief by killing or maiming cattle, etc., of any value or any animal of the value of fifty rupees) after a complaint from a villager. Deputy superintendent of police, New Mandi police station, Himanshu Shekhar said, “After a complaint filed by a villager, the two accused were arrested and sent to jail. Further investigation is on.” Notably in December last year, eight men of a gang were arrested in Saharanpur who allegedly used to target live cattle and then poison them with “hazardous substances” and sell their meat to several prominent hotels in the city and other parts of Meerut district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/two-arrested-on-suspicion-of-poisoning-several-cattle-in-muzaffarnagar/articleshow/82107529.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Private hospitals too are not admitting patients for lack of beds. Even lifesaving injections are not available in the district. While death rate of Covid patients is rising steeply, health department is watching helplessly at the deteriorating condition,” he said. He said Telangana district headquarters like Asifabad is 65km from Chandrapur, Adilabad is 110km and Karimnagar is 150km away. With lesser number of Covid patients in the neighbouring state, quite large number of beds are available there with good doctors and medics to take care of patients. “Also, there is no paucity of oxygen for patients in Telangana,” he said. Mungantiwar said as all medical facilities are available there, Telangana hospitals in the neighbouring districts can be availed for patients from Chandrapur. This will help in curbing the rising number of cases in the district, he added.“I have talked to Telangana finance minister Harish Rao and he has assured to respond positively if Maharashtra government sends a proposal in this regard,” said Mungantiwar. He pointed out that administration here has procured 36 new ambulances three months back. These can be used to transport the patients to Telangana for treatment. Mungantiwar, who is also former finance minister, called upon the health minister to check the possibilities of availing the hospitals in three bordering districts of Telangana and sign a memorandum of understanding for treatment of Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/avail-tgana-border-hosps-for-chanda-covid-ves-ex-fm/articleshow/82108191.cms||Mazhar Ali

The Centre on Friday assured grants to the tune of Rs 65 crore, while the state has already earmarked Rs 150 crore to build the facility. To begin with, a new biosafety level-3 facility will be erected within the Parel campus to manufacture the vaccine. Dr Sandeep Rathod, managing director of Haffkine biopharma, told TOI on Friday that the plant will have a capacity to produce 22.8 crore doses annually. “From now on, we will take at least one year to start manufacturing, but we will try to expedite,” he said. Constructing the facility alone could take six months, followed by validation steps and multiple checks to assure quality of vaccine produced. The institute will be opting for a prefabricated laboratory likely to come up in a plot next to the polio manufacturing plant in the sprawling campus. Veterans, who have seen the illustrious institute fight to survive, are hopeful that the Covid vaccine will bring it back into the game. Rathod said a technical team would be put together to facilitate the tech transfer that would be overseen by department of biotechnology. What share of doses would go to the state and how much would be nationally distributed are details yet to be worked out, he added. “Currently, the approval is not for a fill-finish option since there is no vaccine in bulk that needs to be filled and finished. We have been given permission for the long-term plan, that is, manufacturing the vaccine,” he added. Haffkine got the Centre’s approval on Thursday to produce Covaxin, jointly developed by ICMR and Bharat Biotech.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-haffkine-will-take-a-year-to-roll-out-1st-batch-of-vaccine/articleshow/82108952.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Police said the accused was unemployed and often demanded money from his father. The deceased, Mahendra Pal, lived with his wife, daughter and 40-year-old son Anil Pal. Police said, on Thursday, Anil asked his father to give him Rs 50 but Mahendra refused. “As told by Anil’s mother in her complaint, her husband’s refusal left Anil agitated and he started an argument with him. His father then also scolded him for being unemployed and dependent on him. The argument soon turned violent. Agitated over his father’s comments, Anil took a knife and stabbed him twice in the chest. Seeing Mahendra collapse, his wife intervened, but Anil attacked his mother too. She escaped the attack with injuries. Anil then fled the house,” said a cop. The family alerted neighbours and police were informed. Mahendra was rushed to Deep Chand Bandhu Hospital where he died. The body was then sent for a postmortem. DCP (North West) Usha Rangnani said teams were sent to nab Anil and he was arrested within a few hours before he could flee. “It was established that the murder took place in a fit of rage.

---||Pune||Just half a day’s Covishield stock with PMC, drive hit||PUNE: Vaccine stocks are fast depleting in the city, leaving the Pune municipal authorities with just enough Covishield doses to last till Saturday afternoon. There are currently minimal doses left at PMC’s Narayan Peth vaccine store. Around 11,000-20,000 Covishield doses were being administered in the PMC limits during the last few days. The total vaccine balance in Pune district was 1.24 lakh doses (Covishield and Covaxin) by April 15 night, and the district needs over 4 lakh doses for the next five days, health department’s official data showed, with officials saying that no new vaccine stock arrived on Friday. On Friday, many vaccination centres in Pune rural could not hold the drive, with only 196 centres operating as against 276 on Thursday. Total beneficiaries vaccinated on Friday dropped to 49,312 in Pune district from 61,064 on Thursday. A Pune Zilla Parishad official said, “Efforts were made to redistribute the vaccines among centers. There were delays in starting sessions as redistribution was happening between centers, which may have caused a drop in the number of live session sites on Friday.” He however added that Pune rural had enough stock for Saturday’s drive. A district health department official told TOI that the drop in vaccinations on Friday was due to vaccine shortage, especially that of Covishield in Pune city. “While the PCMC has enough doses for the next two days, Saturday’s vaccinations in the PMC limits will have to be done by operating minimum centres due to the shortage here” the official said. A PMC official said, “Though Covaxin is available for second doses, Covishield is not. We have been constantly following up, but no doses have come so far.” Health officials said PMC had 22,680 Covishield doses till Friday morning. This number included Covishield doses with hospitals (called stock available in pipeline) in its limits as well as in the Narayan Peth vaccine store. However, over 15,800 Covishield doses were administered on Friday. PMC officials said hospitals finishing all their Covishield stock on Friday may not be able to get more till additional doses of the vaccine are dispatched from the state. A chartered accountant who went to a hospital in Kharadi said, “The hospital cited shortage of Covishield on Friday. So, I had to return without the shot. Many people from our society came back without getting the jab due to this issue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/just-half-a-days-covishield-stock-with-pmc-drive-hit/articleshow/82108187.cms||Neha Madaan

The order by Justice Anu Sivaraman came after considering a petition by Treasa Josfine of Kollam through advocate PR Milton. The petitioner had challenged the notification for a permanent post of safety officer at Kerala Minerals and Metals Ltd that excluded women, citing the need to work at night. A HC division bench had held in 1994 (Hindustan Latex Ltd vs Maniamma) that Section 66(1)(b) of Factories Act, which restricts women from working between 7pm and 6am, can only be a protection against exploitation of a woman worker. In the judgment, Justice Anu Sivaraman said that Section 66(1)(b) is only a protective provision and it cannot be an excuse for denying engagement to a woman who does not require such protection any more. “It is the bounden duty of the respondents who are Government and Government functionaries to take all appropriate steps to see that a woman is able to carry out the duties assigned to her at all hours, safely and conveniently...,” the court said Setting aside the provision in the job notification, the court held that the embargo that female candidates cannot apply is violative of right to equality, right against discrimination, right to equal opportunity in public employment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cant-deny-jobs-to-women-citing-night-shifts-hc/articleshow/82108202.cms||---

While the tally of active cases rose to 6,320, the death toll shot to 869 with six casualties. Over the last 48 hours, 1,684 people have tested positive in the state, and the case positivity rate is at 28%, the highest ever. In the last two days, the state had witnessed a rise in Covid mortalities involving younger people. Of the six deaths reported on Friday, three were below 50 and died within a week of being admitted to hospital. Of the five deaths reported from Goa Medical College, two — a 51-year-old man from Belagavi and an 80-year old male — died within a few hours of hospitalisation, the mortality bulletin said. The 80-year-old man was detected positive six days ago. He was monitored under home isolation. “He developed breathlessness and desaturation and passed away within two hours of being brought to GMC,” the bulletin read. In another case, the patient was admitted as a medico-legal case into a surgical unit, but tested positive. The exact cause of his death will be known only after the post-mortem, the bulletin said. Except for in one case, five who died did not have any major comorbidities. In the last 48-hours, eleven people have succumbed to the virus. The spread of the virus has been relentless in urban areas with Margao leading with the highest caseload among all centres. On Friday, its tally touched 725. The centre has been reporting 70 to 80 new cases daily. The commercial town is slated to have municipal elections on April 23. Other urban areas also reported an alarmingly high number of cases. Porvorim’s tally shot to 589 while that of Mapusa, Panaji, Candolim, and Ponda each touched over 400 active cases. The pace of infection picked speed in Vasco and on Friday its count was 370 while that of Cortalim was 345. The intensity of infection was indicated by a more than marginal growth reported from smaller towns such as Bicholim, Sakhali, Pernem, Cansaulim, and Shiroda. Even a small village like Loutolim saw its numbers breaching the 100-mark. With the state witnessing an unprecedented rise in cases, the smaller centers that until last month had either zero or few cases, are reporting cases though their numbers are still under control.

Nancy, who is pursuing BA in Journalism and Mass Communication, had written to PM Jacinda to get her perspective on leadership and teamwork for a project she and her other classmates had been working on. “We decided to make a documentary on the Prime Minister of New Zealand as she is globally applauded for her leadership style and wrote to her”, she was cited as saying in a communique issued by UPES. In a letter to her, the New Zealand PM said, “I knew I could be Prime Minister and a mother, not because there is anything special about me personally but because women and parents multi-task all the time, juggling families and work. I am certainly not the first and I won’t be the last. Women may face some extra challenges in life but that is because of people’s perceptions, not because of our abilities.” She also shared leadership lessons with the students and asked them to lead with kindness, work hard, be compassionate and thoughtful and follow passion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/new-zealand-prime-minister-jacinda-ardern-helps-upes-student-with-college-studies-project/articleshow/82107538.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

While private schools have mostly returned to online classes, teachers and students of the schools affiliated to the state board are in a fix. Without any government circular, there is no possibility for them to resume online classes. “Now, the students of classes IX and X are coming to schools while the students of classes XI and XII are preparing at home for the final board examinations scheduled to begin from June 15. We are expecting the Madhyamik Board to issue a circular, allowing the schools to bring the classes IX and X students on alternate days.

The arrested person was identified as Manhas Abulaise of Palakkad. Sources said that the arrested person was a crew member of a flight which landed at the Cochin International Airport Limited (Cial) from Ras al Khaimah, the UAE, on Friday. The gold in compound form in five packets were concealed on his person and the sleuths based on specific intelligence, identified and nabbed the accused person. In compound form, the contraband weighed 2.55kg and as much as 2.2kg of gold was extracted from the paste. The extracted gold was worth Rs 1.07 crore, sources said. Sleuths are investigating the antecedents of the accused person. He would be interrogated and presented before the magistrate on Saturday. According to sources, sleuths suspect that smuggling syndicates are luring cabin crew members into smuggling in the wake of a drop in the number of international flights due to the pandemic. An investigation is on to find if more cabin crew members were involved in such smuggling bids. Gold haul worth Rs 30L Meanwhile, the air intelligence unit (AIU) of customs yet again foiled an attempt to smuggle gold through the Cial on Friday. Sleuths intercepted an air passenger who was carrying gold worth approximately Rs 30 lakh at the airport and seized the contraband. The Malappuram native, who arrived in Kochi on Friday morning on an Indigo flight from Dubai, had concealed 921 grams of gold on his person. AIU officials interrogated the accused person to find information about others involved in the smuggling, sources said. He was released on bail as the seized gold was worth less than Rs 1 crore. AIU sleuths had on Sunday pulled off a major seizure by intercepting an air passenger, a Kannur native with five bottles which had a compound of liquefied gold and juice in it. The ‘juice’ bottles were kept in the check-in baggage of the passenger who came from Dubai. Sources said that smuggling attempts even through unique methods are being foiled due the keen vigil maintained by sleuths at the airport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cabin-crew-held-with-gold-worth-rs-1cr/articleshow/82108231.cms||---

There are even discussions going on look into the closure of hostels in the campus but administration said that they are waiting for the government order for that as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ru-to-restart-online-classes/articleshow/82108197.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Migrants take interior paths to enter from Gujarat||JAIPUR: The migrants from Maharashtra, Gujarat and southern states are entering into the state from interior paths other than the Ratanpur border in Dungarpur. The fear of nationwide lockdown has forced many migrants to return in huge numbers from these states. The local administration is on toes as migrants holding RT-PCR tests are entering from the Ahmedabad-Udaipur highway, while those who don’t have test reports are using alternate ways — catchment area of Mahi dam, forests and hills. Once they enter, presenting of test report is not required anywhere in the state. Sudhir Joshi, SP, Dungarpur, said that most of the migrants (tribals) from his district arrived before Holi, while those coming now are from other districts. He said that they have set up check-posts at six other entry points to ensure that no one enters without producing a valid test report. “The number has increased after reports that migrants have been entering from different paths,” said Joshi. He added that on April 16, 1,488 migrants reported at the Ratanpur border. “Of the total, only 695 were carrying test reports, while other 793 didn’t have the report. As per protocol, they were sent back and were asked to come back with a report,” Joshi added. The border areas like Chikli-Himmatpur, Modasa and Mandli-Dahod (Banswara) offer safe passage to migrants who are not carrying test reports. A very few of them are coming under the scanner of the administration who are placing them in institutional quarantine of 14 days. Karshna Rajsingh, a social activist, said that undergoing test for migrants in Gujarat and Maharashtra is not easy. “News reports are pointing out that reports are taking 2-3 days and for migrants, it is difficult to wait for the reports. In such a situation, they are left with no option but to look for alternate ways,” said Rajsingh. Meanwhile, Bharatiya Tribal Party has demanded that the state should make arrangements for RT-PCR at the border. “Turning them away in the absence of test report is inhuman. The state should arrange their stay, conduct the test and those who test positive should be quarantined in government facilities,” said Velaram Ghogra, state president, BTP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/migrants-take-interior-paths-to-enter-from-gujarat/articleshow/82108208.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||TRS to stay away from Lingojiguda race after BJP plea||HYDERABAD: In a rare instance of rising above political feud and showing bipartisanship in recent times, both the ruling TRS and BJP found common ground with the former deciding not to field a candidate in Lingojiguda ward bypoll. The TRS agreed to BJP’s request of not putting up a candidate in the bypolls to be held on April 30 along with elections in seven urban local bodies across the state. The seat was won by BJP’s Akula Ramesh Goud in December 2020 GHMC elections, but he died on February 11 even before taking oath. The BJP has decided to field Goud’s son now. TRS working president KT Rama Rao on Friday announced this after a delegation led by former BJP MLC N Ramachander Rao and TRS MLA from LB Nagar D Sudheer Reddy along with family members of Ramesh Goud met him. KTR also called up TPCC president N Uttam Kumar Reddy seeking Congress’ cooperation to make it a unanimous election. In united AP, whenever a candidate died, other parties never fielded their candidates in the bypoll. The TRS has, in a sense, revived the practice, analysts said. The ruling party’s decision came in the midst of an acrimonious and bitter election battle for Nagarjuna Sagar assembly constituency which is going to polls on Saturday. Before announcing the decision, KTR even spoke to party president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and took his consent. Sources said KTR went by the CM’s instructions and made his decision known to the delegation. During the meeting with Goud’s family members, KTR said his untimely death was unfortunate. Ramesh Goud’s family members later thanked KCR and KTR for their gesture. The BJP leaders are also planning to meet Congress and other parties’ leaders and appeal to them to not field their candidates and help ensure Goud’s son’s unanimous election. Meanwhile, nominations for Lingojiguda ward began on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-to-stay-away-from-lingojiguda-race-after-bjp-plea/articleshow/82109557.cms||Koride Mahesh

Health department officials admitted that no beds are available for critical patients and those requiring oxygen or ventilator support. Only a handful of general beds are available for non-serious patients at Covid treatment facilities. Health department is frantically building 100 oxygen-bed facility at Women’s Hospital here. However, only 21 beds have been readied so far, sources claimed. Many citizens could be seen queueing up at hospitals to get a bed for themselves. Similar is the situation at radiology centres where patients have to wait in long queues to get their chest scan done. Official sources claimed of the total 1,020 beds in 11 Covid Care Centres (CCC) operational in the district, only 150 were available by Wednesday evening. Similarly, there are total 372 beds in Dedicated Covid Care Centres (DCHCs) and of these only 116 general beds, meant for mild Covid patients, are available presently. Nine Dedicated Covid Hospitals in Chandrapur have a total of 564 beds, but only 4 were vacant till Wednesday evening, said sources. Earlier, former finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar had suggested shifting of serious Covid patients from Chandrapur to hospitals in Asifabad, Karimnagar and Adilabad district headquarters of neighbouring Telangana state that are located between 65 and 150 km range from the city. He had also asked health minister Rajesh Tope to initiate talks with government of Telangana on the issue. However, health officials ruled out the possibility saying it is risky to rush critical patients to such a long distance for treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-bed-shortage-in-chanda-as-cases-spiral/articleshow/82108207.cms||Mazhar Ali

The Covid-19 virus has been mutating and various mutations have been found in many countries, as well as in India. These include UK (17 mutations), Brazil (17 mutations) and South Africa (12 mutations) variants. These variants have higher transmissibility. The UK variant has been found extensively in the UK, all across Europe and has spread to Asia and America. Read our coronavirus live blog for all the latest news and updatesHowever, the Centre expressed concern that several states did not send samples for genome sequencing along with clinical data of positive people, despite being advised to do so. Read AlsoCoronavirus: India’s worst-hit city by share of population is NashikIn absolute numbers, Mumbai has added 3.7 lakh cases between March 16 and April 15, much higher than any other city, while Delhi seems like it is the next worst hit. Absolute numbers, however, can give a misleading picture as cities with much bigger populations would tend to have more cases.The double mutation (two mutations) is another variant and has been found in several countries like Australia, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Namibia, New Zealand, Singapore, UK and US. "Higher transmissibility of this variant is not established as yet," the government said. "The RT-PCR tests being used in India do not miss these mutations as the RT-PCR tests being used in India target more than two genes," it added. It also said the sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR tests remain the same as earlier. The clinical data of positive people will enable great epidemiological insight into the link of the surge at various places to the variants, as well as enable to discover other variants of concern, if present in the community, the government said. "Many states, including Maharashtra, MP, Rajasthan and Kerala, have not yet shared the data with NCDC, though Punjab and Delhi have shared such data," the health ministry said in a statement. Till Thursday, 13,614 whole genome sequencing samples were processed at the 10 designated INSACOG labs. Of these, 1,189 samples tested positive for variants of concern for SARS-CoV-2 in India. This included 1,109 samples with UK variants, 79 samples with South African variants and one sample with the Brazil variant. "The detection of these mutations does not change the strategy of management which remains to test, track, trace and treat. The use of masks remains the most important shield to prevent the spread of Covid 19," the ministry said. The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) is a network of 10 laboratories. The network was set up in December to continuously monitor the genomic changes of SARS-CoV-2 in India through whole genome sequencing. Daily new cases in the country are increasing rapidly with 2,17,353 new cases registered on Thursday. Ten states, including Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, accounted for 79.1% of new cases. Maharashtra reported the highest daily new cases at 61,695. It was followed by Uttar Pradesh with 22,339 while Delhi reported 16,699 new cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rt-pcr-catching-all-covid-variants-government/articleshow/82110173.cms||Sushmi Dey

The curfew timing had set off a debate on why Pune was being singled out for extra two hours of restrictions as against the state government’s orders issued under Break the Chain, released on April 13 by state chief secretary Sitaram Kunte. Ajit Pawar told citizens to adhere to the present norms to avoid full lockdown. He said if people did not cooperate even after the imposition of the curfew, the administration might have to impose complete lockdown like the last year “unwillingly”. After the three-hour-long Covid review meeting of the district with the local administration and elected representatives, the deputy chief minister announced that all MLAs would be allowed to use Rs1 crore each of their local area development funds towards Covid treatment and control in their respective assembly constituencies. The state MLAs are allocated Rs4 crore under the MLA local area development funds. Last year, Rs50 lakh could be allocated for Covid mitigation. This year, the amount had been increased to Rs1 crore each, the deputy chief minister told reporters. A total of Rs350 crore has been sanctioned under local area development funds for the legislators of the state. On the oxygen shortage, Ajit Pawar said the state was in talks with private oxygen companies in Raigad. He said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had already been assured of oxygen supply from Reliance by its head Mukesh Ambani He advised private doctors to prescribe remdesivir judiciously, as advised by the state’s technical experts. He said the state was in in talks with various companies from Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Goa and Karnataka to procure the drug in the wake of the current shortage. On the political parties’ alleged reckless campaign for the Pandharpur-Mangalwedha assembly bypoll amid the Covid cases in the state, he said the Election Commission of India had scheduled the election date and not the state government. He said one cannot campaign sitting at home and stressed that the same scenes were witnessed in all the poll-bound states, including Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Assam and West Bengal. Ajit Pawar said the Pune district had received only 10 ventilators of the 165 units assured by the Centre of the total 1,121 allocated for the state and he would follow it up with the central officials. On many vaccination sites closing because of shortage of doses in Maharashtra, he said the Centre’s go-ahead to Covaxin production from the Haffkine Institute would help the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dy-cm-justifies-longer-curbs-cites-consensus/articleshow/82108224.cms||Nisha Nambiar

He said the government after consultation with all stakeholders have decided to take some stringent measures like weekend curfew and night curfew to the good of the people and appealed to them to co operate with the administration. He said the government is aware of the economic hardship to the people and is trying to balance both life and livelihood. Meanwhile, Gehlot blamed politicians, judiciary and Election Commission for the current Covid surge. Despite opposition from the states, the Supreme Court and high courts issued orders for holding panchayat and local bodies elections. ECI continued announcing elections simply to discharge its duty, he said in a series of tweets on Friday. Gehlot said Sonia Gandhi has rightly said that we politicians are also to be blamed to some extent for the spread of Corona infection. He said the new Corona variant has created a frightening situation in the country. Politicians continued aggressive campaigning and the crowd kept on gathering despite the Covid threat, said the chief minister who had announced night curfew and week end curfew to deal with the current ‘terrifying’ situation of Covid. He asked the Prime Minister to hold discussions with the states in detail as he did earlier to address the issues involved in the fight back against the virus. The state is adopting stringent measures like lockdown and curfew to deal with the situation, said Gehlot. He added on the one hand we ask people to follow Covid protocol and on the other hand lakhs of people continued to gather in election rallies and roadshows. It has been going on since Bihar elections. He opined that the election campaign could have been held virtually.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/prevention-is-best-cure-for-covid-cm-to-public/articleshow/82108228.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Contempt case: Telangana HC tells babu to serve iftar food||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Friday allowed another IAS officer to purge himself of a contempt case by doing some social service in lieu of the punishment. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy, while hearing a contempt appeal filed by excise deputy commissioner Syed Yasin Quereshi, asked him to serve at least 20 people per day at any one of his chosen mosques during this ongoing Ramadan month by offering them food when they break fast. He has to do this for a week. Both the officer and the state’s additional advocate general J Ramachandra Rao who was representing the appellant have readily agreed to the proposal. A single judge earlier imposed a penalty on the IAS officer for not releasing a jaggery lorry on time despite a court order. Moreover, the officer imposed certain new conditions to release the vehicle even after causing more than 3 months delay and the high court did not accept the conduct of the officer for trying to interpret the order of the court in his own way. The bench also verified the contempt antecedents of the IAS officer and his current residence. The additional AG said that this officer resided at Banjara Hills and did not have any previous contempt history. The additional AG clarified that in the current case too he never had any intention to show any disdain towards the courts or its orders. The bench finally waived the fine amount subject to the service he has to render but made it clear that they would not monitor the service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/contempt-case-hc-tells-babu-to-serve-iftar-food/articleshow/82109563.cms||---

After infecting over 70 students in IIT Jodhpur hostels, the corona infection reached the hostels of Jai Narayan Vyas University. On the advice of hostel wardens, many of these hostel inmates have given their samples for corona test on Friday. The exact number of students having tested, however, was not known yet. Vice-chancellor of the university Praveen Chandra Trivedi said that a few students had tested positive in the hostels, after which some other students developed symptoms of corona. “Considering the seriousness of the matter, we advised them to get tested. They have given their samples on Friday and are awaiting reports.” said Trivedi, adding that their symptoms were like corona infection. Meanwhile, the university administration has vacated all the hostels of the university and has postponed the examinations with immediate effect. Before this, 22 inmates of a private hostel in the city had also tested positive in the previous week. All of them were advised quarantine in hostel rooms itself. The virus infection in an academic institution was reported in IIT Jodhpur, where 72 students had tested positive. IIT spokesperson Amardeep Sharma said most of them have recovered and have been accommodated back in their rooms. “There were a total 1,200 students, out of which, those whose practical sessions have been completed are being sent back to their homes,” he said. The IIT administration is constantly carrying out random tests of the students with symptoms to do away with possibility of the infection on the campus and a strict check has been imposed on movement of students outside the campus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/after-iit-virus-now-invades-jnvu-hostels/articleshow/82108230.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra government says fortnightly random RT-PCR tests for workers not must||PUNE: The state government has finally decided to relax the fortnightly random RT-PCR tests it had mandated for household helps, hotel and restaurant staffers, industrial workers and e-commerce delivery persons in the wake of the strain the decision had put on the laboratories. State relief and rehabilitation secretary Aseem Kumar Gupta told TOI on Friday that the new orders issued by the state government did not suggest the 15-day random RT-PCR tests for the workers. “If the local authorities have made them mandatory, they should revise it. It was unnecessarily overwhelming the testing laboratories. I will communicate this to the local authorities,” he said. “As the Covid-19 positivity rate is high in the state, only genuine cases need to be tested. There is no need for the mandatory tests on all workers and household helps. Those having symptoms should get themselves tested,” Gupta said, reiterating that the earlier compulsory mandate of testing the workers every 15 days has been discontinued. The Maharashtra government had in an earlier order said people delivering essential services and who have not been vaccinated should carry negative RT-PCR reports valid for 15 days with effect from April 10. This directive was issued for staffers engaged in manufacturing units, e-commerce services and restaurants, among other services. When told that the local authorities have maintained the orders for testing, he said it was not needed. especially when the new orders have restricted people’s movement till the end of the month. “We have received several complaints of RT-PCR reports coming in after 2-3 days, or even later. The laboratories are overburdened to provide the reports on time. In these times, we cannot flood them with random tests. We can re-consider it if the situation changes,” he added Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao told TOI that the clause for random mandatory test would not be applicable and the necessary amendments would be made by the local administration in the revised orders. PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar told TOI that the revised orders would be soon issued. Founder of Bharatiya Jain Sanghatana and philanthropist Shantilal Muttha, who has been pursuing with the state government on the issue, said the fortnightly tests of the workers had led to an exponential increase in the testing and overburdened the laboratories. “This resulted in the delay in the test reports of the critically ill and symptomatic patients and affected their hospital admission. I had raised the issue with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, requesting him to reconsider the compulsory test norms. We should not put pressure on the already overwhelmed machinery,” Muttha said. Lead and coordinator Pune Platform for Covid response and president of Mahratta Chamber of Commerce Industries and Agriculture president Sudhir Mehta said the removal of the compulsory testing for private workers and housemaids “is a welcome move, albeit delayed”. He said, “We have unnecessarily burdened an overloaded system with tests, which are not needed . More importantly, we don’t have the capacity to conduct so many tests.” Some housing societies had even contacted laboratories to have mobile testing laboratories and were paying the charges for testing of the ancillary workers. The individual flat owners were supposed to pay the test charges of the domestic helps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maha-govt-says-fortnightly-random-rt-pcr-tests-for-workers-not-must/articleshow/82108232.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Many Covid-19 cases go undetected in RT-PCR test||JAIPUR: Many patients are coming to hospitals who are tested negative by RT-PCR test, but they have pneumonia. Clinical features, serum markers and CT scan of chest clearly indicating Covid-19 infection. In most of the cases, X-ray showing lungs normal but HRCT showing high CT severity score suggestive of bilateral ground glass opacity. Covid-19 is going undetected in RT-PCR test in many cases which has increased worries of the doctors. In second wave, the low sensitivity of RT-PCR implies that a large number of Covid-19 patients will not be identified quickly and may not receive appropriate treatment. “It looks like that in the second wave, Covid-19 is bypassing RT-PCR. People come to hospital in advance stage as Covid-19 advances symptomatically with short history,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller of SMS Medical College and head of Covid-19 treatment panel of doctors. In the Covid-19 management protocol 2021, Dr Bhandari and his team said that CT chest has a bigger role when RT-PCR is negative in Covid-19. “Early diagnosis of Covid-19 is crucial for disease treatment and control. Compared to RT-PCR, chest CT imaging may be a more reliable, practical and rapid method to diagnose and assess Covid-19. Chest CT, a routine imaging tool for pneumonia diagnosis, is fast and relatively easy to perform. Recent research found that the sensitivity of CT for Covid-19 infection was 98% compared to RT-PCR sensitivity of 71%,” says the Covid-19 treatment protocol, 2021. The Covid-19 treatment protocol, 2021 also highlighted case study, how quickly Covid-19 is affecting lungs and usefulness of HRCT in assessing condition of lungs. In case one, a65-year-old male asymptomatic Covid-19 positive patient on day 3 of admission have normal looking chest X-ray, but HRCT chest suggestive of bilateral patchy ground glass opacities with CT severity score of 10/25. Second case was of a39-year-old man diagnosed as Covid-19 but symptomatic on day 7 of hospitalization have mild right lower zone pneumonia but HRCT chest suggestive of diffuse lung involvement of right lower zone as well as bilateral upper zone with CT severity score of 14/25. In case 3, a 65-year-old man asymptomatic Covid-19positive patient on day 7 have normal looking chest X-ray but HRCT chest suggestive of multiple ground glass opacity with consolidation with CT severity score of 16/25. All these cases were RT-PCR negative cases. Another case of a person tested negative by RT-PCR was of a 52-year-old male diagnosed as Covid-19with mild fever on day 5 of hospitalization have normal appearing chest X-ray but HRCT chest suggestive of bilateral ground glass opacity with CT severity score of 18/25.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/many-covid-19-cases-go-undetected-in-rt-pcr-test/articleshow/82108237.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hosps gasp for oxygen, govt may seek cos’ stocks||Hyderabad: With hospitals running short of oxygen supplies, the Telangana government is considering asking private companies to transfer their industrial oxygen stocks to hospitals to meet the immediate needs of severely affected Covid-19 patients. Health minister Eatala Rajender on Friday confirmed that the state is facing oxygen shortage. “Our daily requirement is 250 tonnes of oxygen whereas we have only 100 tonnes to cater to the patients. We were getting oxygen from Karnataka, but the neighbouring state has stopped sending oxygen to other states, including Telangana. We even brought this matter to the notice of the Centre,” he said. He said the government also urged the Centre to divert oxygen from steel plants like Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) to states as a stop-gap arrangement to overcome oxygen shortage. Sources said Telangana gets its oxygen supply mostly from Ballari in Karnatakal and VSP apart from local production. However, with a sharp spike in positive cases in Andhra Pradesh, the VSP authorities are first meeting the requirements of AP. They also reportedly expressed their inability to produce beyond 100 tonnes of oxygen daily, which goes to AP. Sources said the oxygen supplies from Karnataka are reportedly being diverted to Maharashtra, which is the worst-affected state, following the Centre’s directive and hence, Telangana was not able to get its daily oxygen supplies from Ballari. To reduce dependence on neighbouring states, the state government set up self-generated oxygen plants in five hospitals with the help of the Centre. But, they cater to five major government hospitals like Gandhi, TIMS and Karimnagar government hospital. These plants can serve a maximum of 500 beds and oxygen is generated within the hospital premises. Apart from self-generated oxygen plants, there are liquid oxygen beds which also come in handy for the patients. But, these beds too depend on oxygen supplies from elsewhere. Meanwhile, demand for portable oxygen cylinders, which have a shelf life of five years, is going up. They have a capacity of 10 litres of oxygen and last depending upon the usage. Doctors said these cylinders, each costing Rs 400, are mostly used by people under home isolation and by small hospitals and home isolation centres. “We sold about 100 cylinders when the first wave of pandemic struck. Now, we are getting a lot of calls for these cylinders,” Bharat Veer Katakam, owner of a company which deals with Covid-19 essentials, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hosps-gasp-for-oxygen-govt-may-seek-cos-stocks/articleshow/82108241.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The cost of preparing a copy of the chargesheet is pegged at Rs 2.66 lakh.The trial in the case is yet to commence and is getting delayed, affecting thousands of investors.A source said A Senthil Kumar and M Vivek had reportedly collected Rs 818 crore from 1.72 lakh investors in the western Tamil Nadu by promising a monthly return of Rs 850 for 60 months on an investment of Rs 10,000, which would be returned at the end of the investment tenure. Agents were promised a commission of Rs 2,000 on every investment of Rs 1 lakh.Lured by the hefty commission, many investors became agents. However, Senthil Kumar and Vivek, who had floated online portals under the titles of Fine Futures India, Fine India Sales Private Limited, Best Way and Way2success, shut their business and fled.The EOW police arrested the duo from Chennai in March 2013. While Vivek’s younger brother M Nithyanandan was arrested in the case later, R Sathyalakshmi, an accountant of the firm, surrendered before the TNPID court in July 2014. At least 43 agents of the firm were also arrested.The EOW police have received 25,289 complaints from the victims so far, according to which the duo had cheated them of Rs 189crore. They filed the chargesheet before the TNPID court. The EOW police also have to furnish copies of all the 25,289 complaints, each of which runs into at least four pages, and primary and official witness details to the accused.“We have sent a letter to EOW superintendent of police M Thillai Natarajan, seeking Rs 1.25 crore to furnish the copies of the chargesheet, along with other documents, to the 47 accused,” said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/fine-future-scam-eow-seeks-rs-1-25cr-for-chargesheet-copies/articleshow/82108993.cms||A Subburaj

This is the third time this month that the state has reported over 60,000 cases in a day. With this, the total caseload touched 37 lakh, and the death toll stood at 59,551. The state has added nearly 9 lakh new cases in the month of April so far. In Mumbai, the daily tally was below 9,000 (8,803) for the second consecutive day on Friday. The daily toll, however, continued to rise, with 53 deaths reported on Friday as against 50 the previous day. Since March 2020, over 5.6 lakh cases and 12,250 deaths have been registered in Mumbai. “Although daily deaths are going up, our case fatality rate hovers around 0.5%,” said a BMC public health department doctor. Dr Gautam Bhansali, who coordinates between BMC and private hospitals, said the bed situation is better now than it was a few days ago. “It will further improve in a couple of days when private hospitals start transferring their stabilized patients to step-down facilities in five-star hotels. More beds will be available for fresh patients,” he said. Dr Rahul Pandit from Fortis Hospital, Mulund, who is a member of the state government’s task force on Covid, said ICU beds are still difficult to come by. “Moreover, in Mumbai, even after hitting the peak, the plateau stays on for a long time. We may thus see 8,000 to 10,000 cases every day for a few more weeks, and that is a big load of patients,” he said. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said they are hopeful this is the peak for Maharashtra, but there is no way to predict what the peak could be. He also said the district administrations has been informed to ensure that large hospitals install their own oxygen concentrators and even set up plants to convert atmospheric oxygen to medical oxygen to ensure their patients are self-sufficient. CM Uddhav Thackeray asked the BMC to coordinate with other agencies and take care of providing Covid test reports as early as possible, management of hospital beds and oxygen supply and availability of medicines in Mumbai. The CM took stock of the Covid situation in Mumbai and said early diagnosis would help to curb the spread of Covid. The BMC should also coordinate with suppliers of oxygen and medicines, he said. .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-states-daily-tally-highest-at-63729-toll-biggest-in-196-days/articleshow/82110821.cms||Bhavika Jain

---||Noida||Noida records 8% dip in recovery rate in a little over month, Gzb 6%||Noida/Ghaziabad: The recovery rate of Covid patients in Noida has dropped by 8% over the past one month or so. Ghaziabad has seen a 6% dip in recovery rate during this period.The first 15 days of April have been a cause for concern for health officials in both the districts. Not only have daily Covid cases seen a rapid rise this month, the recovery rate has slipped while fatalities have gone up. Covid cases in the first 15 days of April are already 5.5 times that of March this year and nearly 16 times that of February in Noida. Till April 15, the district had 2,334 active cases. By the end of February, Noida had a recovery rate was 99.3%. There was a marginal decline in March, when the recovery rate dropped to 98.3%. However, as cases saw a sharp rise this month, the recovery rate fell to 91.5% as on April 15. In Ghaziabad too, the number of cases in April registered a four-fold surge from March and 16 times that of February. The district had reported 2,892 cases in the 15 days of this month. In whole of February and March, Ghaziabad had reported just 770 cases. The recovery rate has dropped by 6% in the past two months. Ghaziabad’s recovery rate was 99.4% in February, which has come down to 93.7% this month.Officials pointed out that the recent surge in cases was also because of the fact that both districts had ramped up testing recently. The severity of cases can also be gauged from the number of deaths in Noida, which has added seven fatalities this month. Before this, the last Covid-related death was recorded in the district on January 5 and the toll remained at 91 for long. In Ghaziabad, the toll remained at 102 for three months on the trot. But towards the end of March and in April, the district had added one death each to the tally.Officials agreed that more patients were turning critical this time. “There are more people who are contracting the infection quickly. Earlier, when one person in a family got infected, others did not. But now, it spreads to all the family members quickly. Also, many more people are needing hospitalisation now,” said a senior health department official. April has seen at least two breaking points when cases have started compounding in Noida. On April 9, the district reported over 200 cases for the first time. Since then, cases have only multiplied and remained over 200 daily till April 13. In the past three days, cases have doubled and have stayed over 400 daily. From 229 fresh cases on Tuesday, the district saw 483 cases on Wednesday and 489 on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-records-8-dip-in-recovery-rate-in-a-little-over-month-gzb-6/articleshow/82108995.cms||Snehil Sinha

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad left breathless as supply of oxygen cylinders takes hit||HYDERABAD: In a repeat of 2020, city’s oxygen cylinder supply is again on the brink of drying up. With an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases across India, sourcing from other states has become a challenge. Market sources say they have little or no stock and there’s no guarantee when the supplies will be replenished. At least half a dozen suppliers that TOI called on Friday confirmed the poor stock situation. “We are left with only 10 of the 110 cylinders (Jumbo size of 7,000 litres) that we shipped in last year. Even the 100 that have been leased for free are being used in rotation by beneficiaries,” said Mohd Shujatullah of Humanity First Foundation that’s been flooded with desperate calls. “We have received at least 40 to 50 calls daily asking for cylinders in the last few days. We haven’t been able to help all,” he added. The daily requirement for Telangana is about 250 tonnes of oxygen, but only 100 tonnes are available to cater to the patients. Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra are primary places to source oxygen cylinders. Major hospitals aren’t spared either. “From only two or three a day in mid-March, our home care bookings have jumped to over 200 now. Of these, 40% to 50% are from Hyderabad alone. Given that many among them need oxygen support, even we are staring at an acute shortage,” said Dr Mahesh Joshi, CEO, Apollo Home Healthcare Ltd. “This year is worse than 2020 since Covid numbers have spiralled across India at the same time, leaving no scope for us to source cylinders from neighbouring states,” he added. The handful of dealers sitting on limited stocks, meanwhile, are charging an exorbitant price – Rs 12,000 for a jumbo cylinder usually available for Rs 4,000 to Rs 5,000. Rentals too have shot through the roof. When TOI posed as a beneficiary and called a dealer in Toli Chowki, he demanded a deposit of Rs 3,000 and rent of Rs 7,000 of one cylinder. “I can arrange by evening...but that is only if you agree to this price. If you can get it at a cheaper rate somewhere else, please go ahead,” Imran, the dealer said. Usually, these cylinders are available for not more than Rs 600 to Rs 1,000 a month. Though filling stations in Hyderabad are trying to meet some of the demand, by operating round the clock, the staff say that the queues outside are still getting longer. “Cylinders that came in for a refill three times every two weeks earlier, are now coming at least six to seven times. So, even though we have ramped up our operations by almost 100%, it is getting difficult to meet the requirement,” said a staffer at Baba Gas Agency, Nacharam. The cost of refilling a cylinder too has jumped from Rs 300 to Rs 600.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-left-breathless-as-supply-of-oxygen-cylinders-takes-hit/articleshow/82109565.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

This, even as lakhs of residents, including senior citizens and people with comorbidities, await their turn to get the jab — some, their second shot. On Friday, TOI spoke to a few beneficiaries who expressed shock over their second round of vaccination suddenly being cancelled. “Both my wife and I received messages generated by the CoWin app recently asking us to reschedule our appointment for the second dose. There was no reason given to explain why the appointment was cancelled,” said Joy Dutta, a 55-year-old who took the first dose on March 20. “Both of us have comorbidities and want to get the second dose as soon as possible,” he added. Another person, on condition of anonymity, said, “I had scheduled an appointment for my parents, but it got cancelled. Now, I don’t see any slots available till next month. When I enquired, I was told by hospital authorities that have stopped administering the second dose because they have run out of stock. There is no clarity on just when the stocks will be replenished.” Though confirming the immediate short supply, Dr Nikhil Mathur, group chief of medical services, Care Hospitals said, there was no reason to worry. “They haven’t cancelled the second dose; it could just be a delay due to shortage of supply. The message being sent to beneficiaries probably means that it is cancelled on that particular date and they can take it whenever there is an availability,” he said. The state chief secretary, Somesh Kumar, meanwhile, said that the government is constantly monitoring the situation and informing the Centre on the requirement of doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vaccination-drive-hits-supply-roadblock-lakhs-await-2nd-dose/articleshow/82108244.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Goa||Goa: As cases soar, CM puts onus on individuals to curb spread||PANAJI/SALIGAO: Friday’s jaw-dropping exponential single-day spike of 927 Covid cases notwithstanding, chief minister Pramod Sawant continued to put the onus on individuals to control the spread of the pandemic in the state by using face masks, sanitisers and maintaining social distancing. “Covid cases are rising every day. We have to take responsibility to control the spread of the virus. The government is in a big way providing vaccination to the people, besides providing testing centres, hospitals, quarantine centres and kits. At least one thing we have to do at an individual level is to wear face masks, use sanitisers and maintain social distancing,” Sawant said. During the last couple of days, on an average, one out of every three-four persons is found to be Covid positive. Emphasising on the importance of testing and hospitalisation, Sawant said that the mortality rate of Covid-19 can be reduced only when people get out of their homes, get tested and get hospitalised as soon as they are symptomatic. “We have issued the necessary advisory and we are constantly telling the people to avoid crowded places and maintain social distancing. If you have come in contact with any person with the infection or symptoms, you should get yourself tested, home-isolate yourself, quarantine yourself. Also, do not delay in getting hospitalised. This is my request. There is no need to get scared,” Sawant said, after visiting the North Goa district hospital. While reiterating his stand on a lockdown and night curfew, the chief minister said, “There is no way by which we can impose a lockdown. We have just emerged from the impact of one lockdown and cannot afford one more as it would severely affect tourism and industrial activity. Being a tourist state, night curfew will impact the tourism industry very badly.” Sawant had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for permission to vaccinate all hospitality industry staff, across age groups, and had said that the PM told him that he should stress on promoting vaccination and not go for a lockdown. On Thursday, the state witnessed its record single-day spike as 757 Covid-19 cases were reported, putting the state’s health infrastructure in tatters with all the nearly 550 beds, including 75 in private hospitals, occupied.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-cases-soar-cm-puts-onus-on-individuals-to-curb-spread/articleshow/82109003.cms||---

They were given the Covishield vaccine. The resident medical officer (RMO) of Bollarum General Hospital, Dr Rama Krishna, told TOI, “Initially, we were vaccinating 60 to 80 people a day, but on Friday, the number went up to 200. Apart from Cantonment area, people abutting the Cantonment also thronged the hospital.” Till date, over 4,000 people have been vaccinated at this hospital, the RMO said. “Soon, another four vaccination centres — Lal Bazar, Picket, Rasoolpura and Balamrai -- will also be opened in the Cantonment, keeping in view the rush for the vaccine,” said the RMO. Meanwhile, health officials urged the state to supply vaccination vials which were in short supply at upper primary health centres (UPHCs) in the Cantonment. “At present, vaccine is being given to 100 people in each UPHC,” said Deputy DMHO, Raj Kumari. In fact, there is a shortage of manpower at some UPHCs, said Kumari, asking SCB authorities for staff to ensure vaccination programme continues without interruption.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vaccine-rush-at-bollarum-hospital/articleshow/82108257.cms||Sunil Mungara

Also, there are some who are aware of the poll process and are running an awareness campaign, inspiring others to vote — they are all first time voters living in Salt Lake, Rajarhat and New Town, who are going to vote for the first time on Saturday. “It’s a big day and I am set for it. I have already watched a few tutorials on YouTube about EVM’s operation and am excited that I would be inside a polling booth for the first time as a voter. I remember accompanying my grandmother twice when I was a small child. On Saturday, I will be exercising my voting rights as an adult for the first time,” said Sankhadeep Dutta, a first year BSC student and a resident of New Town. While the first time voters are excited, they feel it is a tough election, considering violence and other issues that the state witnessed in the previous phases. “We have the responsibility to shape up our future. I believe our generation has the power to bring in the right change and take the country in the right direction, for which voting is necessary. I have the major issues and agendas in my mind while voting on Saturday. I have discussed with my friends and we will all vote early. We are also spreading an awareness message, asking others to vote,” said Srimoyee Chakraborty (18), a first year history honours student at a city college and a resident of Salt Lake. There are some like New Town resident Anamika Roy (38), who will also be exercising her voting rights for the first time. “All these years, I couldn’t get my voter ID card done as my husband has a transferable job and we could never settle at one place. One year we were in Gujarat, the next year we were in Maharashtra and then we were in Rajasthan. Finally, we have settled in Bengal for the past five years and I have got my voter card. This time, I will vote for the first time,” said Roy, a homemaker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/family-social-media-tips-for-first-time-voters/articleshow/82108263.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Some make the extra buck before curfew comes into force||JAIPUR: At about 5pm in the Lal Kothi Sabji Mandi, the vegetable sellers had no option than to abandon the unsold tomatoes, bottle gourd, bitter gourd and other perishables on the roadside. Standing a few feet away, they called out buyers offering bitter gourd at Rs 10 per kg instead of Rs 60, tomoto at Rs 5 instead of Rs 30, and 3 kg of bottle gourd for Rs 10. They were afraid of losing their weight measuring instruments to the roving policemen who were intent on closing the mandi by 5.30pm. The scenes in the markets were different. Cigarettes were out of stock in many places. Whoever selling was asking for Rs 20-50 extra. Ghutkha was also in the artificial shortage category. In liquor shops, many had to pay extra Rs 100-300 per bottle. As offices were closed at 4 pm, there were crowds of people at every bus stop. It was also the day for the auto rickshaws to earn some extra bucks. For a ride of Rs 60, commuters had to pay Rs 150. While the announcing the week-end curfew, the chief minister had tweeted that there would no disruption to the supply of essential commodities including milk. But many dairy booths and shops ran short of the milk on Friday. “The supplier did not bring cigarettes today. When I called him, he told me to collect from his place and said I have to pay Rs 20 per 20 unit packet. Because of the extra money, I decided not to keep cigarettes. If people horde and the curfew is lifted on Monday, many will lose money,” said a shop owner in Raja Park. He admitted that both the suppliers or area dealers and the shops take advantage of such emergency situations and there is no government interference to punish them. Markets looked unusually crowded on Friday as people carried home large quantities of soft drinks, ice creams, snack foods and other items even though these items will be available during the curfew days. “There is a fear that people may not get what they like. In situations like this short supplies of a few items happens. That is the reason they are stocking on their favorite items today,” said Bhaskar Sharma, a grocery shop owner. By 6pm, the roaming police vehicles and the cops on the roads managed to bring down the shutters of the markets in what otherwise would have been a busy beginning to the weekend business.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/some-make-the-extra-buck-before-curfew-comes-into-force/articleshow/82108261.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Exports units to operate normally, riders for domestic mkt focussed cos||Jaipur: In a relief to the manufacturing units, the government in its guidelines for the week-end curfew allowed most of the indusstrial units to operate but there are some restrictions for those who are catering to the domestic market exclusively.Besides the factories that are engaged in the manufacturing and production of essential products, the government has allowed export-orientied units to continue operations.“Sending exports consigments on time is the first priority of the exporters. If they miss deadlines on sending goods, they stand not only to lose the business but the client and future clients as well. We had urged the state government to allow them to run unhindred,” said Sanjay Saboo, chairman of CII-Rajasthan. Factries which are in the nature of continuous production are also allowed to operate. But those companies that cater to the domestic market will have to run night shifts or keep their employees in the factory premises if they want to keep their production going. IT and emergency services are also excluded from the curfew. But all have to follow Covid SoPs.Meanwhile industry associations in various industrial zones are worried about workers leaving for their native places and issued guidelines to curb the migration.“We are happy that the factories will continue to operate. But the worry is the workers leaving for their native places. We have told the manufacturing units to create confidence among the workers so that they stay here and work,” said Nilesh Agarwal, president of Sitapura Industries Association.The association has written a letter to its member businesses suggesting them not to give unduly extra advances to their employees as there is a risk they might leave for their home town.However, the factory workers continued to leave for their homes as buses. More than 30 buses are going to Bihar since past 4-5 days, said a representative of the bus transport association in the city. A large chunk of people working in the city are from Bihar. Digvijay Dhabriya, chairman of PHDCCI-Rajasthan, an industry body, said, “We expect about 25% of people leaving. If the construction activity slows down or markets remain shut for more hours, there will be less demand for raw materials and goods. If the demand contracts, the production level will also go down. So, some workers leaving will not impact the operations.”However, Agarwal said that it is difficult to get the demand supply situation always right. “Most of Mumbai is shut today. If the curfew is lifted, there will be surge in demand for products. We need to have workers ready to meet the production requirements,” added Agarwal.Others in the industry said that many of the laborers leaving are not engaged in core manufacturing. Tarachand Chaudhury, president of Vishwakarma Industrial Area, said, “There are some who are daily wagers. They are the first ones to leave. But those who are in core manufacturing, they are less inclined to move.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/exports-units-to-operate-normally-riders-for-domestic-mkt-focussed-cos/articleshow/82108255.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||Petition filed in NGT over illegal felling of trees, causing severe damage to roots of trees||Ludhiana: Council of Engineers on Friday filed a petition with National Green Tribunal (NGT) against “illegal axing/felling” of trees and “causing severe damage” of roots of trees in the name of Urban Environment Improvement Programme by municipal corporation (MC) as well as Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT).Engineer Kapil Arora alleged that nine trees with ages varying around three to 35 years were axed by MC near Community Centre of BRS Nagar, Canal Bridge Ludhiana and the matter was raised with the chief conservator of forests (plain zones) as well as district forest officer of Ludhiana on March 30. He added that however, despite knowing the facts that there are directions of NGT, no action has been taken by them till date and now the trunks of axed trees have also been uprooted by the MC.“Further, the size of the central verge of Malhar Road is being reduced and the roots of many trees are being cut to adjust the paver blocks by Ludhiana Smart City Limited. Such Act of department is against Environment (Protection) Act 1986 as well as directions of NGT in a case titled Kapil Dev vs State of Punjab & others vide which the tribunal has directed MCL, LIT and GLADA to leave open space of one meter in radius around trees in Ludhiana. However, all three departments are deliberately ignoring the directions of law and are continuously causing damage to Environment. The matter of contempt of NGT orders will be initiated in the coming few days,” Arora said. Engineer Abhishek Tiwari said fixing of interlocking tiles along roadsides is in progress in Block F, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar, Ludhiana where the department has completely damaged the roots of three trees out of which two trees have already fallen and third tree may fall at any time in near future. Council of Engineer said that 24 trees were uprooted in Ludhiana following a wind storm on 6th April in Ludhiana. “The main reason behind uprooting of trees is concretization as well as cutting of roots of trees due to which trees do not get proper nutrients and thus loose grip with earth too,” it added.Engineer Mohit Jain said that trees are already very limited in almost 50% area of Ludhiana which includes old city area, Shimlapuri, Haibowal Kalan, Jassian and Chander Nagar. “If such act of causing severe damage to environment continued in Ludhiana, the number of trees in Ludhiana will decrease drastically and our generations will have to pay in terms of health issues for such unlawful acts of development authorities. According to the report submitted by the appointed committee of Supreme Court in one case in February 2020, the monetary worth of a tree is age multiplied by Rs 74,500 which means the value of one tree of age 35 years is more than Rs 26 lakh,” he added. Arora further said the NGT vide its orders dated September 5, 2018 has directed that any felling of trees in Punjab must be done strictly after following the statutory procedure. “This aspect may be monitored by the regional officer of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF&CC) at Chandigarh. If it is found that any tree has been illegally cut, appropriate action may be taken against persons responsible for such illegal action in accordance with law. Such action may also be included in the action taken report to be submitted to this tribunal. However, despite knowing the facts that statutory approval from regional office of MoEF&CC is mandatory but MCL as well as LIT have not taken any such approval before axing the trees completely or damaging the roots of trees in Ludhiana,” he added.“Keeping in view of directions of NGT, we have filed a petition with the tribunal by making MoEF&CC, chief conservator of forests (plain areas), district forest officer, MCL, Ludhiana Smart City Ltd as well as LIT as respondents in the case with plea of compensation to environment by development authorities by planting sapling of different trees amounting to value of each tree as per its age as assessed by committee appointed by Supreme Court,” Arora said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/petition-filed-in-ngt-over-illegal-felling-of-trees-causing-severe-damage-to-roots-of-trees/articleshow/82107628.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Stormy weather rains woes on farmers||Farmers use a tarpaulin sheet to shield the crop from rain, in KarnalBarnala/Hisar/Karnal: Stormy weather and rain forecast added to the woes of farmers in Punjab and Haryana on Friday. In both the states, cultivators have been lining up at local grain markets to sell their wheat harvest, but have been facing the problems of slow procurement of the crop and poor storage for it. The probable challenge of the harvest getting damaged by rain compounded their troubles. In Punjab, a visit to the grain market in Barnala revealed that farmers had been waiting for their produce to be procured by a government agency for up to four days. In Haryana’s Karnal and Hisar districts, farmers faced a similar predicament. In all three districts, produce had been kept in the open. In Punjab, Sukhdev Singh, a farmer from Sanghera village in Barnala who had been waiting at the local grain market, said he had been camping at the local “mandi” (a colloquial term for grain market) with his gandson for four days. “The arhtiyas say workers have still not arrived from Bihar and now the inclement weather is worrying us,” he added. There has been a shortage of labour at grain markets in the state. In previous years, labour used to reach before or at the start of procurement. Some farmers in Barnala felt arhtiyas, because of the direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme, were not interested in calling labour this year or the Covid-19 scare was stopping workers from coming. They said the government was also not ensuring that procurement did not suffer due to labour shortage. Arhtiyas, in their defence, said workers were on the way and they could reach in a day or two. Workers filling wheat in sacks at a grain market in Patiala, PunjabFew metres away, Bahadur Singh from Bhadalwad village said he brought wheat to the market three days ago, but failed to sell the produce as there was no labour to clean and prepare it for procurement. “We have already lost 6-7% to yield. Now, if there are rains, moisture content will considerably increase and we may have to sit for more days to sell it,” he added. Pointing to a water tank nearly 100 metres away from his heap, Bahadur said there was no water in the tank since the day he arrived. “Either I have to get water from home or pay Rs 20 for a bottle. We were thinking about how to follow Covid protocols, but here is nothing; no dispensers, no soaps here,” he added. Haqam Singh from Pharwahi village told TOI that farmers had to face hardships at every step. “No one cares for us. This wheat is the only source of our livelihood for six months; it started with less yield. Now when we reached the mandi to sell the produce,there is no one to take care of the crop as the shed constructed many years ago for unloading grain is now unsafe; the floor is cracked and infested with rodents, only vehicles are parked here and grains are made to unload in the open. Now arhtiya have no labour with him. Above all, weather is changing for the worse,” Haqam painted a grim picture of farming. Farmers Bhajan Singh and Surinder Singh pointed to a “huge shortage” of gunny bags for packing the wheat, and tarpaulins for protecting the grain from weather. “We could not properly cover the grains even in inclement weather,” they said. District mandi officials said all arrangements had been put in place. “Water has been arranged for farmers and employees of procurement agencies are making purchases where arhtiyas have cleaned the wheat,” said one of them, Haryana situation In Haryana’s Karnal district, more than 65% procured wheat and quintals of unsold stock were lying in grain markets. Farmers and arhtiyas feared they could be damaged if it rained. The district witnessed a mild drizzle on Friday evening, which not only hampered harvesting but even the procurement process at purchase centres. Assandh farmer Jagdeep said, “The meteorological department has predicted rain on April 17 and 18, which may create a problem for us as the moisture content in grains will increase and procurement agencies won’t accept it.” As per official data, till April 15, 5.56 lakh metric tonne (LMT) wheat had been procured by state procurement agencies at MSP. Of this, only 1.82 LMT procured wheat could be lifted. Till Thursday evening, 3.74 LMT procured paddy was yet to be lifted and a huge quantity was lying on an open plinth without being put in gunny bags. Space crunch problems, meanwhile, continued in mandis and farmers were not getting the space to unload their produce. Commission agents claimed that wheat was lying in the open as agencies were short of gunny bags, which had impacted the lifting process of procured wheat. “Due to space crunch at Karnal mandi, I had to unload my crop on the road. Vehicles sometimes drive over it. Rain will also add to the moisture content,” said Mukhtiar Singh, a farmer from Dabri village. Rajneesh Choudhary, president of Karnal Arhtiya Association, said, “Agencies are not providing enough gunny bags. Apart from this, tardy lifting of procured wheat is forcing farmers to unload their produce on roads. Now, the prediction of inclement weather has added to their worries.” Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav also held a meeting with officials of the mandi and procurement agencies as the meteorological department had predicted rain on the weekend. The district authority has directed them to ensure the arrangement to save the stock from getting damaged in case of rainfall, he added. He said 40% procured wheat had been lifted till Friday afternoon. “We hope 60%-70% procured wheat will be shifted to the warehouse by Saturday morning. We have sufficient arrangements to cover the remaining produce. We have established 15 procurement centres,” the DC added. In Hisar, thousands of tonnes of wheat was lying in the open in grain markets due to delay in lifting. While traders were alleging delay in unloading due to unlifted stock, the administration denied it. Chhabildas Kedia, president of Hisar Grain Mandi Aadhati Association, said at present more than two lakh bags of wheat were lying in the open, while about 20,000 quintals of wheat was on the road outside the mandi. Full report on www.toi.in“This problem is due to delay in unloading. As wheat is now being unloaded in Food Corporation of India warehouse, where there are permanent labourers, they do not work after unloading 135 bags. This causes delay in unloading,” he said. “If the administration starts unloading in other warehouses, then private labour can join and unloading work will be faster. I had even talked to the chief minister on Thursday night, and he had assured me of finding a solution,” he added. Kedia claimed that 1,000 quintal of wheat was spoilt last year due to soaking in rain. “Now, the weather has deteriorated again and if it rains, wheat would be spoilt again,” he said. Hisar deputy commissioner Priyanka Soni said the matter was not about unloading, but traders not wanting to send wheat to FCI warehouse, where unloading is done only after thorough examination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/stormy-weather-rains-woes-on-farmers/articleshow/82109039.cms||---

Under the OTS, the consumer would be able to settle pending payments existing as on December 31, 2020. The scheme will be applicable for three months from April 15, and in order to enrol in the scheme, the industrial consumers need to deposit Rs 2,000 to Rs 5,000 as processing fee according to their power load and this fee will be adjusted against the final settlement bill. Meanwhile businessmen are happy over the development and are of the view that the scheme will help settle the old disputes over pending payments. According to Inderjit Singh Navyug, former president of the United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association, “We are thankful to the PSPCL for launch of the OTS scheme, which will help end thousands of litigations and disputes related to outstanding bills of the businessmen with the department. According to the terms and conditions of the OTS conveyed by PSPCL to us, all consumers whose connections have not been disconnected the disputed amount shall be payable with 12% annual interest from the date it became due, meaning only 1% per month. In the case of consumers whose connections have been disconnected, the default amount along with 12% annual interest will be payable along with fixed charges for the period of disconnection subject to maximum of one year. In addition to this, the consumer whose connections have been disconnected will also have to pay security and reconnection fee as applicable in accordance with the schedule of general charges.” According to Rajinder Singh Kalsi, another industrialist, “There are thousands of industrial consumers in Janta Nagar division alone who have entered into dispute with the PSPCL over the power bills. The OTS introduced by department has come as a blessing for such consumers as in most of the cases consumers and PSPCL officials are at loggerheads over the amount of penalties and other charges levied on the actual amount of default. Opting for OTS will end all the lengthy process at one go and will also end the dispute in the shortest possible time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/pspcl-launches-ots-scheme-to-settle-pending-power-payments/articleshow/82107631.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Coimbatore||Wild elephants terrorise residents of Sirumugai||Coimbatore: Fear gripped the residents of Bommalapalayam, a small village in Sirumugai, after two wild tuskers entered their farmlands and roamed around the area for more than 24 hours, attacking two senior citizens, who were critically injured, and the livestock.While the elephants entered the human habitat around 4pm on Thursday, they could be sent back to the reserve forest only around 4.45pm on Friday.District forest officer Venkatesh Durairaj said the forest staff had seen the tuskers coming out of Pethikuttai forest on Thursday evening. “They chased them, but lost sight of them at Anjaneyar Kovil Karadu. In the early hours of Friday, the elephants were again spotted, this time at Bommalapalayam village, which is 9km away from Sirumugai. The staff sprang into action immediately and started trying to guide them back to the reserve forest.”Around 24 forest staff, including assistant conservator of forests M Senthil Kumar, were involved in the mission. They advised the people to stay indoors as much as possible and be alert if they had to step out at all. People panicked after they saw a cow being attacked by one of the tuskers.“The tuskers were in their 20s. They had strayed almost 20km-25km away from their usual path. While they walked through banana and maize farms, they didn’t raid any standing crop. We guided the tuskers to the reserve forest by 4.45pm today (Friday),” the assistant conservator of forests said.However, everything wasn’t a smooth affair. While on their way back to the forests, the tuskers attacked two senior citizens, who came on their way. “The elephants caught hold of them by their trunk and threw them away, injuring them. We provided them first aid and took them to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital,” Senthil Kumar said.One of the victims was identified as 80-year-old Palani, a resident of Chittepalayam. The other one was an old woman. “They didn’t seem to have heard our announcements on the elephant movement in the area.” the officer said.Pointing out that the tuskers had injured two cows as well, he said they were being treated by the animal husbandry department. “The cows are healthy and stable.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/wild-elephants-terrorise-residents-of-sirumugai/articleshow/82109002.cms||---

---||Nagpur||NMC cremates home dead with Covid protocol, but don’t add them in toll||Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on Friday cremated with Covid-19 protocol a symptomatic patient who died at home. But the civic body did not conduct RT-PCR test on the deceased, and also reportedly did not count him in number of Covid-19 deaths. This raises a question whether NMC is trying to show fewer fatalities, and also raises concerns that no contact tracing was done of his family. In this case, an official from NMC Gandhibagh Zone had also intimated Lakadganj police station that the deceased was positive and died at home. The 50-year-old businessman residing in a flat scheme at Telephone Exchange Square had all symptoms of novel coronavirus. “His HR-CT scan on April 4 showed score was 9/25. On the same day, the man told the security guard of the flat scheme to stop housemaid. He also brought an oxygen cylinder as oxygen saturation level was low. He was taking treatment under a physician. He died at around 8pm on Thursday at home. Five staffers of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) arrived at around 12noon on Friday and took away the body for cremation,” neighbours told TOI. The officials of NMC health department said the man did not conduct RT-PCR test and they were handed over copy of HR-CT scan by his wife. “The man’s HR-CT score was 9/25 so we ensured cremation as per Covid protocol to prevent infection to others. Death was not counted in Covid fatalities as deceased was not tested positive in RT-PCR or rapid antigen test (RAT),” they said. The officials also said the same was being done on daily basis for all suspected patients dying at home. “We intimate police station whatever the family members tell us. In case there is no suspicion regarding death, our staffers with PPE kits collect the body from home and cremate it,” they said. As per guidelines issued by the government last year, RT-PCR test of suspected home deaths is mandatory to contain spread. NMC used to comply with the guidelines last year, but seems to have stopped in second wave, from third week of February. The neighbours also said no one from NMC visited the home of the deceased or tested the two members residing in the same house. Social activist Narayan Ahuja said, “Inquiry should be conducted and stringent action taken against officials. Many such deaths are going unregistered. It is also mandatory for private clinics and radiology centres to inform NMC about such patients. Verification should be done whether NMC received information on April 12 from clinic and diagnostic centre about the HR-CT scan report of deceased. NMC is not monitoring this, so cases and deaths are on the rise.” Similarly, an 87-year-old man from Sakkardara in South Nagpur died at home on April 13. The deceased’s son said the man had severe breathlessness since April 11. The deceased’s oxygen saturation level was below 60 when he was taken to a private hospital. The doctor there refused to admit him on seeing low oxygen saturation level, said no bed was available. Then, the man was taken to a diagnostic centre for HR-CT scan but that too was not done due to long queue. But RT-PCR or RAT was not conducted. The man was taken back home and died the same day. NMC allowed funeral as per normal procedure. The family members got their RT-PCR test done on April 16 and are awaiting reports.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-cremates-home-dead-with-covid-protocol-but-dont-add-them-in-toll/articleshow/82108278.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Kolkata||West Bengal elections: Covid-positive patients eye last hour to cast votes||KOLKATA: As large parts of Bidhannagar, Rajarhat, New Town and Dum Dum go to polls on Saturday, uncertainty among Covid-positive voters and their family members surpass the excitement. Majority of patients and their family members in isolation fear that they might not be able to cast their vote in the last hour. The increasing number of cases has even cast a shadow over the voting rights of new patients in south and north Kolkata, which go to polls in the phases scheduled later this month, as the time to register for postal ballots for absentee voters is over and all they can hope is to get better before the poll day with “last-hour” votes as their only option. “Both my son and I tested positive last Saturday. But thankfully, both of us are recovering well. I was not sure whether I would be able to cast my vote, but now I know the process and will go to cast vote in the last hour after 5.30pm, wearing PPE and following all other measures,” said Moinak Simlai (57), a resident of Salt Lake’s GC Block. As per EC guidelines, those testing Covid positive can come to the polling booth and opt to cast their votes at the polling centre between 5.30pm and 6.15pm. But an acquaintance has to inform the presiding officer beforehand and get a token registered for the patient. In the last four phases, around 3.5 crore voters have exercised their franchise, but barely a couple of Covid-positive patients have stepped out of their homes to vote. “The norm is that the positive patients have to come dressed in PPEs and they will allowed at the last hour of polling when the polling staff take proper precaution,” said an official. While Covid patients with mild symptoms said they would use the last hour voting option, there were many who are either admitted at hospitals or are bedridden at their homes. They may not be able to cast their vote this time. As per the EC guidelines, absentee voters (senior citizens above 80 years of age, persons with disability and Covid-19 suspect or affected persons) were given the facility to vote from home through the postal ballot option but the application had to reach the returning officer during the period from date of announcement of election to five days following the date of notification of the concerned phase. Notification for the last phase of election (April 29), when Chowringhee, Maniktala, Entally, Shyampukur, Beliaghata, Jorasanko and Cossipore-Belgachhia would go to vote was made on March 31, which means the last date of application for postal ballots had got over by April 5. Hence, Covid patients under the last three phases only have the option of last hour voting. “The polling process for Covid affected patients should have been publicized more. I will cast my vote in the last hour and would appeal to all other patients with mild symptoms to cast their vote in the last hour if they can,” said New Town resident Samaresh Das, who tested Covid positive on Tuesday and is now in home isolation with mild symptoms.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: After Jaslok, more private hospitals add Covid beds||MUMBAI: A day after directing Jaslok Hospital to convert into a full Covid facility, BMC on Friday revised its decision and issued fresh orders stating the hospital will continue to admit non-Covid patients but in smaller numbers. Now, 77% of the hospital’s beds will be allocated for Covid care, BMC said. Plus, several private hospitals said they have started augmenting Covid beds looking at the rising demand. Powai’s Hiranandani Hospital said it had increased Covid beds from 105, including 20 ICU beds, to 125 last week, and now it has increased them to 180 out of 240 that are operational. Holy Spirit Hospital’s Sneha Joseph said that their hospital’s total Covid bed count has gone up to 159, including 22 ICU beds. Of the city’s 20,044 Covid beds, 6,190 are in the private sector. The civic order on Jaslok claimed 30 critical cancer patients and 22 heart and kidney patients were admitted and shifting them may prove fatal. It is unclear why the civic body didn’t seek this information to begin with. In the new order, the BMC said, “It has been brought to the notice of MCGM that presently 30 critical patients undergoing cancer treatment and another 22 critical patients undergoing cardiac/nephro treatment are already admitted in the hospital and considering their medical condition, shifting them to other hospital at this juncture may prove fatal.” A total of 175 (77%) beds out of 227 shall function as Covid beds in Jaslok, including 29 ICU beds. “52 beds catering to above mentioned critical patients shall continue to be non-Covid beds,” stated the circular signed by civic chief I S Chahal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-jaslok-more-private-hospitals-add-covid-beds/articleshow/82109024.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Consumer forum tells school to refund Rs 2.4 lakh fee||HYDERABAD: A district consumer forum here directed Geethanjali The Global School to refund Rs 2.4 lakh to a consumer for collecting the fee by suppressing the fact that their International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGSE) affiliation had been cancelled. S Rameswar Rao, the complainant, submitted that his son had taken admission in Geethanjali The Global School during the academic year 2016-17 in class 10. After completion of class 10, he had decided to continue in the same school for AS and A level, which is equivalent to class 11 and class 12, for the academic years 2017-18 and 2018-19 and paid a total of Rs 2.4 lakh as fee. He submitted that the school management suppressed the fact that the Board of Cambridge University cancelled the school’s recognition as the school failed to maintain Cambridge International Education standards and collected the fee from parents. He alleged that the school even failed to conduct exams on time due to which most of the students, including his son, lost their valuable academic year. Rao said that after he started demanding the school to conduct exams, the school suggested him to approach another Cambridge-affiliated school in Gandipet so that his son can continue his studies, but said the school failed to cooperate. He alleged that despite informing the same to Geethanjali The Global School, the management failed to take any steps to correct their mistake. The complainant said that despite submitting a representation to the school, approaching National Commission for Scheduled Castes, and getting a legal notice issued to the management, his issue remained unresolved. Vexed with the attitude of the school, he said that he approached the forum. The opposite party did not choose to appear before the commission despite a notice being issued. “The institute is responsible for the misrepresentation of facts to the complainant that their school was approved by IGCSE. Thus, it is required to refund Rs 2.4 lakh to the complainant with interest at 6% per annum along with costs,” said the bench after examining the material evidence submitted by the complainant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/consumer-forum-tells-school-to-refund-rs-2-4l-fee/articleshow/82108284.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Children’s playground and park at the entrance of West Club Road was also removed,” he said.“During Covid times, the outdoor green spaces were the only respite from stress. It is sad to see us losing such valuable spaces,” Saleem told TOI. “While the recommended open area for a person is 10 to 12 sqm, in Coimbatore, we have only 2sqm. Destroying play areas and traffic islands are blatant violations of environmental norms, which have made the area accident-prone. While more than 70 trees have been cut, roots of the remaining trees have been exposed, risking their survival. It impacts local flora and fauna.”Race Course residents have been up against the project since work began a year ago. “Resident association members tried to meet minister S P Velumani a year ago. Even last week, they had a meeting with corporation officials, but to no avail.

---||Nagpur||Covid patients in lurch as pathologists face blood test kit shortage||Nagpur: Troubles seem to be increasing for Covid-19 patients with each passing day, with the latest being the shortage of effective blood test kit, like D-Dimer and Serum Ferritin. The kit is used to gauge the severity of the infection and plan the course of treatment. Meanwhile, in a ray of hope, district collector Ravidra Thakare has assured supply of 61.5 metric tonne liquid oxygen and 8,622 jumbo cylinders to the 170 Covid hospitals in the district. The hospitals have been also asked to collect their fixed quota of oxygen directly from distributors. The collector has also asked the citizens to lodge complaints regarding oxygen shortage to the NMC helpline (0712-2567021) and district control room (0712-2562668). Known as ‘inflammatory markers’, blood tests D-Dimer and Serum Ferritin are crucial to detect the clinical conditions like ‘cytokine storm’ which may lead to a multiple organ failure that could prove fatal. With the rise in number of active patients, especially ones requiring hospitalization, there is great demand for the kits but supply is limited. Leading pathologists also complained about the high demand and scare supply of other kits too for tests like Inter-leukin-6 and C-Reactive protein (CRP) for measuring the infection spread. “These tests are crucial to monitor the infection spread, apart from CT scan and X-ray. The treatment is modified accordingly,” said Dr Kishor Deshpande, consultant pathologist to National Cancer Institute. “D-Dimer valuation decides whether the time has come for Remdesivir or relocation to ventilators from Covid ward,” he said. The diagnostic centres of these pathologists, who are also engaged as consultants with the hospitals, are experiencing an almost four to five times more footfall. “We are trying to procure the blood test kits from different companies but still the demand is so high that the supplies have become unpredictable. I had placed an order a month ago, which is still awaited. I have limited kits left now,” said Dr Swati Atal who owns a diagnostic centre at Ramdaspeth. Dr Milind Pande, consultant pathologist at Orange City Hospital and Research Institute, said the crucial ‘inflammatory marker’ tests are hampered due to scarcity of the kits and the alternative procedures too are often affected due to this shortage. “The hospitals are compelled to outsource the tests when the stocks run out and approach multiple companies for supplies,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-patients-in-lurch-as-pathologists-face-blood-test-kit-shortage/articleshow/82108313.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Hyderabad||Malabar nut can help fight symptoms, says study||Hyderabad: Malabar nut (Adhatoda vasica), a common herb popularised a few years ago by the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB), is now the centre of attraction for researchers, who are searching for a drug to cure the pandemic virus. Researchers drawn from several national institutions including city-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB, have found that certain active pharmaceutical compounds present in Malabar nut (Addasaram in Telugu, Adusa in Hindi and Urdu), used mostly in Ayurveda and Unani, could turn out to be the magic medicine for the treatment of novel coronavirus. The labs have now completed the animal studies and plan to take research further. “Treatment of Adhatoda vasica extract alters the cellular hypoxic (low oxygen) response and modulates the inflammation thrombosis (blood clotting) axis. It reduces lung injury, thrombosis and fibrosis (damage to lung tissue). Moreover, in-silico (computer simulation) and in vitro (in laboratory) analysis suggest it may be able to prevent Covid-19 infection and progression,” researchers said in their study published in the latest issue of the scientific journal, Respiratory Research. The researchers said the results provide a scientific rationale for Adhatoda vasica in ameliorating hypoxia hyperinflammation features. The study also revealed that the herb has properties that reduce the viral load of Covid-19 and assist genes that help in boosting immunity levels. Apart from CCMB, researchers were drawn from Respiratory Research Centre of Excellence for Applied Development of Ayurveda, Prakriti and Genomics, Delhi, and Centre for Translational Research in Lung Disease, Delhi. “Covid-19 pneumonia has been associated with severe acute hypoxia, sepsis-like states, thrombosis and chronic sequelae (post recovery symptoms) including persisting hypoxia and fibrosis. Our recent observations on anti-hypoxic and anti-inflammatory effects of Adhatoda vasica prompted us to explore its effects on relevant preclinical mouse models,” researchers said adding that the properties of this wonder drug could be repurposed for treatment of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/malabar-nut-can-help-fight-symptoms-says-study/articleshow/82108292.cms||Syed Akbar

The project is of the social welfare department of the UT administration. It has asked the civic body to carry out the project for passengers and other needy people. The shelter would be constructed according to guidelines and norms of the central public works development. The civic body has already prepared details of the works required. The building will have all the required facilities. “The central government gives special grants for such projects under special schemes. The administration will soon get the grant. It has already received a communication. Once the grant comes, the work will be started. We have prepared the financial estimates and completed the required documentation,” an official said. The project will have fire-fighting system comprising sprinklers, automatic fire alarm system, boundary wall, site levelling, footpath, internal water supply system, sanitary works, electrical external service connection, power wiring, horticulture works, lift and power-operated doors. The building would be covered by CCTV cameras. “Since all these works are included in the financial estimates, the work will be allotted through a tender process. Eligible contractor will have to complete the work in the stipulated period. Engineering officers of the MC will monitor the work till the end and after the construction, the building will be handed over to the social welfare department of the administration,” an official of the MC said. The department will plan how to provide the facility to the public, take a call on the charges, and make other decisions. This will be the second night shelter of the administration after the one at the bus stand in Sector 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-to-build-72-bed-night-shelter-at-sec-43-bus-stand/articleshow/82107692.cms||Deepak Yadav

The Nilgiris, which recorded 48 new cases of Covid-19 on the day, however, received 5,000 vaccine doses by afternoon. The hill retreat’s Covid-19 tally has touched 9,113, of which 286 are active cases. K Sridhar, 50, a resident of Ooty said, “We have been waiting at the Ooty Government Medical College Hospital (GMCH) to get inoculated since morning. Had the officials told us about the shortage, we would have returned to our houses. The delay has cost us a day’s wage.” Dr P Balusamy, deputy director of public health, confirmed there was a shortage of vaccine doses on the day. “The response to vaccination is getting better. The district administration is taking all possible efforts to get the residents aged above 45 years vaccinated.” According to him, the Nilgiris requires at least 2,500 vaccine doses a day. The hill retreat has vaccinated 1, 00,254 people so far. Except for the GMCH, all the other government health facilities in the Nilgiris are provided with Covishield. The GMCH offers only Covaxin shots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/ooty-receives-more-doses-vaccination-on/articleshow/82108347.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Sr citizens deprived of 2nd vax dose due to wrong interpretation of rules||Nagpur: Despite spike in Covid-19 cases and deaths, senior citizens are being allegedly denied second dose of vaccine by centres in city as well as other parts of Vidarbha. The officials at vaccination centres are wrongly interpreting guidelines of the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) and sending back senior citizens without giving the jab.Sixty-five-year-old Prabhat Kumar Shrivastava, retired official from Indian Navy, and his wife were denied second dose at the vaccination centre at KT Nagar Urban Primary Health Centre (UPHC) of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). “We took first dose on March 5. I logged in on website of Co-Win, which showed our second dose was scheduled on April 14 (40 days from first dose) at vaccination centre situated at Police Hospital. We had taken first dose at this centre,” Shrivastava told TOI.A resident of Mankapur, Shrivastava added, “We were shocked to see Covid hospital has come up at police hospital. There was a board displaying vaccination centre is closed. A staffer suggested we go to NMC’s KT Nagar UPHC. There, a staffer asked us to come again, after 45 days from first dose. I explained to the staffer and also showed my appointment in Co-Win application. But the staffer said they will follow instructions by their officers. We were helpless and returned,” he said.Shrivastava said they were unnecessarily exposed amid widespread disease and had to travel from one centre to other. “We did not fix our schedule but it was an automatic appointment fixed by Co-Win application. First of all, we should not have got centre at police hospital if it was turned into Covid hospital. Secondly, we should not have been denied second dose when our appointment was fixed by the application itself,” he said.The MoHFW had issued revised guidelines on March 22. The advisory said beneficiaries should take second dose of Covishield between six and eight weeks after first dose. At the same time, MoHFW had continued with option of taking second dose after four weeks from first dose.NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said, “Directions were issued to centres to explain about the MoHFW guidelines. But centres were never told not to give second dose if any beneficiary turned up after four or five weeks of second dose,” he said.Officials from Chandrapur district said they were not giving second dose to 60+ and 45+ with comorbidities before six weeks had elapsed after first dose.However, Co-Win application continues to accept appointments for second dose of beneficiaries after four weeks of first dose.The government had rolled out vaccine to people from age-appropriate groups from March 1. By March 15, 1,00,141 people from age-appropriate groups had taken first dose. All were eligible for second dose by April 15.As per data of state’s public health department, only 14,811 (14.79%) people from age-appropriate group took second dose in Nagpur district as on April 15. Similarly, 19,061 people from age-appropriate group took the jab in Chandrapur district by March 15, of which only 1,996 (10.47%) took second dose by April 15.The same situation is prevailing in almost all districts of the region.The centres are giving second dose after four weeks from first one to beneficiaries who took Covaxin. MoHFW had not suggested any change in second dose of Covaxin.MoHFW and experts had said second dose was very crucial. As per MoHFW, sufficient quantity of protective antibodies develop two weeks after second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sr-citizens-deprived-of-2nd-vax-dose-due-to-wrong-interpretation-of-rules/articleshow/82108368.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Christian cemeteries have seen a steady inflow of burials in the last few weeks and community leaders say it’s high time the government provides them with new land somewhere else. Rev. Ganesh Barve, president of Protestant Indian Christian Indora Cemetery Committee said it will be ‘very difficult’ to meet the demand for burials in near future. “Just like last year, we are again seeing the Covid-19 fatalities increasing. Apart from this, the non-Covid deaths are anyway there. We definitely need some new land parcel now else this space will fill up faster than estimated,” said Barve. The adjoining Catholic cemetery too is facing similar problems. Fr Anthony D’Souza, convenor of the graveyard committee under Archdioces of Nagpur said, “There were discussions going on about allocation of land for cemetery near Besa or Beltarodi, but that still has not happened. We are continuing with the burials here but, yes, as the fatality numbers increase we will find it difficult to cope.” Bishop Andrew Rathod of Churches of North India said that though space was always finite, the pace of utilization has gone up. “Such kind of a situation (pandemic) was not there in previous years. At our Tiger Gap cemetery, the space is almost nil,” said Rathod. Rev Barve too said that similar discussions were held with both officials from district collectorate and Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) for land. “We had discussed about land being given near Gorewada but till date nothing has happened regarding it,” said Barve. Manish Swami, secretary of Mecosabagh Christian Colony Welfare Association, said the Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted their pending demand. “The reason land for cemetery is being demanded is advance planning is needed for population growth. Someone from the local authority had suggested a place near Bhandewadi, but that’s a landfill. I hope that our concerns are taken up on priority so that we are ready for the next decade or two,” said Swami.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/as-deaths-go-up-christians-demand-new-cemetery-land/articleshow/82108342.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The accused was sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment (RI) and was imposed a fine of Rs 3,000. The accused, a resident of Borabanda, was arrested for trying to rape a 13-year-old girl. On January 7, 2017, the victim’s mother had gone out for work, leaving the girl alone at home. When she returned home, she saw that the accused was trying to rape her daughter. On noticing the victim’s mother entering the house, the accused fled from the spot. “The victim told her mother that the accused had entered the house seeking water to drink and when she went into the kitchen, he followed her and tried to rape her. Luckily, her mother returned home at the same time and the accused had to flee,” SR Nagar police said. Based on a complaint lodged by the victim’s mother, police registered a case under Sections 448, 354 and 354-a of the IPC and Section 7 r/w 8 of the POCSO Act. Subsequently, the accused was arrested and sent in judicial remand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/man-sentenced-to-3-years-ri-for-rape/articleshow/82108345.cms||---

From shop no.154 to 157, the roof collapsed although no one was injured. The work of renovation under Jaipur Smart City Pvt Limited is going on. Possibly, the roof collapsed due to weak pillars. Two shops on either side also suffered some damages. Jaipur Municipal Corporation, Heritage, workers reached the spot around 10am leaving the debris on the road while the shops in that lane were shut. It took contractors around two hours to clean up the debris. The episode raises questions on the working of JMC, Heritage and Smart City Pvt Limited. Priyavrat Singh Charan, head of Heritage Cell in JMC, Heritage, said that the file is being moved and zonal deputy commissioner has been asked to take action as soon as possible. Meanwhile, head of Dharohar Bachao Samiti of Walled City, Bharat Sharma said that this is a case of sheer negligence of Smart City and JMC, Heritage, officials. "These officials have been working for many years still the work of renovation of verandas is not completed. Renovation of the shops has been going on for a long time and it is better to hold the officials responsible," said Sharma. This is the second incident in six months when infrastructure of UNESCO World Heritage Site has collapsed. A few months back, a portion of heritage wall near Ghat Gate had collapsed due to excessive rainfall. Subhash Goyal, head of Jaipur Vyapaar Mandal, said this is an important issue to be taken seriously. "Due to evening lockdown, we have decided to open shops by 9am and the incident occurred at 8.30am. If it occurred a little later, someone might have got hurt. This is negligence of Jaipur Smart City and JMC, Heritage, officials," said Goyal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/veranda-roof-collapses-in-tripolia-mkt-no-one-hurt/articleshow/82108341.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Mortality rate less than that in first wave, say health officials||Coimbatore: Fresh Covid-19 cases are on the rise in the district, where 583 people were tested positive for the virus on Friday. The tally now stands at 65,993, just seven short of another milestone of 66,000-mark. With 622 patients getting discharged from treatment centres, the number of active cases slightly came down to 4,402 on the day. The Covid-19 toll, however, increased to 706, with one more patient succumbing to the virus. The death rate in the second wave has begun inching upwards slowly. The number of deaths in the first half of April has already surpassed that of March, when 11 people had succumbed to the virus, and tied at the February toll of 12. While the health department officials are maintaining that the mortality rate of Covid-19 patients has reduced drastically, private hospitals say the death rate is same as in the previous peak. Referring to the death rate so far this month, health officials say it is a tiny fraction of the number of deaths seen when the first wave was peaking in August, September and October last year. An official, who didn’t want to be named, said, “There were 254 Covid-19 deaths in August, 128 in September and 122 in October. During these months, the district used to record 500 to 650 cases a day, like what it is registering today. Hence, it is evident that the death rate has dropped drastically. Chances of the district touching the last October’s mortality rate by this month-end is also a non-possibility.” Officials estimate that the highest Covid toll that the district might record in April would be 40, on a par with the last December figures. However, private hospital doctors and epidemiologists warn against people taking the virus lightly. “The death rate is the same as during the first wave. With the new cases beginning to spike, the number of deaths has also started going up,” said Dr A Murali, Covid-19 nodal officer, PSG Hospital. Infectious diseases specialist, Dr Varun Sundaramoorthy, expressed a similar view. “We are seeing the same number of deaths, despite the improved understanding of the virus’ behaviour, well-established treatment protocols and better management techniques. There is no doubt that the virus has grown more aggressive and infected people as young as 29 years now require ICU care.” According to him, 40% of the youngsters requiring ICU treatment and oxygen support does not have any comorbidities. Dr P Kulandaisamy, former public health deputy director who had earlier predicted the second wave would be deadlier than the first wave, said the youngsters with symptoms must get tested immediately. “They might have been vaccinated. It doesn’t, however, matter. They should monitor their oxygen saturation levels and ensure they don't infect the elderly at home.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/mortality-rate-less-than-that-in-first-wave-say-health-officials/articleshow/82108372.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC allows two Jain trusts to send food through volunteers||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday allowed delivery of “special pious food” to be delivered by Jain temple trusts in Mumbai, Pune and Nashik to devotees observing the nine-day Ayambil fast from April 19 to April 27. The delivery is to take place through a team of volunteers, organized by the trusts, not exceeding seven persons or by professional distribution service agencies permitted by the state in its April 13 SOPs. A bench of Justices S C Gupte and Abhay Ahuja, who heard the matter filed by two religious Jain trusts for permission to let devotees go to places of worship to “take away” the special boiled food prepared there, had on Thursday asked the state to work out a solution by enabling delivery via volunteers instead. The food has to be free of salt, spices and other ingredients, advocate K P Shah, who represented petitioners Shree Trustee Atma Kamal Lab Labdhisurishwarji Jain Gyanmandir Trust and Sheth Motisha Religious and Charitable Trust had said. The state government through its counsel Jyoti Chavan said it has no objection on distribution of pious food by a regulated delivery system as proposed by the HC. After hearing the matter on Friday, the HC directed that while preparing food and delivering it to devotees, the petitioner trusts and their agents shall abide by SOPs under the Covid-19 guidelines issued by the state government. The HC said, “It is made clear that under no circumstances shall devotees be allowed to enter temple premises for taking away pious food allowed by this order.” The trusts shall communicate names and particulars of the delivery volunteers to the jurisdictional police station or concerned authority under the Disaster Management Act responsible for monitoring SOPs in advance, said the HC. “To allow devotees to come to premises” of religious trust does not fulfil the rigours of the SOPs issued by the state, said the HC. SOPs of the state do not permit any dining hall to operate so as to allow in-room dining.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-allows-two-jain-trusts-to-send-food-through-volunteers/articleshow/82109071.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Locals, environmentalists oppose beautification of Nainital's Sattal Lake||NAINITAL: Environmentalists and local residents are opposed to the proposed redevelopment plan of the Sattal Lake, which involves building a children’s park, a view point and beautification and landscaping work. They believe concretization in the area will adversely affect the ecology around the lake, which is home to nearly 500 bird and butterfly species. Speaking to TOI, Ghazala Shahabuddin, an ecologist and a senior fellow at the Centre for Ecology Development and Research (CEDAR), said that the woods near Sattal, currently categorized as reserve forest, are home to some of the rarest bird species, including the endangered Red-headed vulture, Steppe eagle and numerous ‘forest specialist’ birds like the long-tailed broadbill that cannot survive in degraded or urban habitats. Because of its rich population of birds, Sattal is a favorite destination of birdwatchers and photographers. “Sattal also has some of the last remaining oak forests which are already threatened by pine invasion, over-exploitation and increasing construction works in Kumaon. Any more infrastructural development in the area will endanger the integrity of this ecosystem. These forests should be left in their natural state as far as possible,” Shahabuddin said. She added said there are plans to build a nature interpretation centre inside the reserve forest area, which will, in particular, cause irreparable damage to the core bird habitat (streamside and hill forest). “Most of the recreational tourists who go to Sattal visit the lake and the cafes but with the planned lakeside development, the number of tourists both inside the forest and outside, is bound to go up, causing massive disturbance to birdlife.” She added that building the proposed nature interpretation centre would take tourists to forests which till now were not frequented by humans, resulting in irreversible damages to the core bird habitat (along the streamside and hill forest). “Most recreational tourists who go to Sattal visit the lake and the cafes but with the lakeside development that has been planned, the number of tourists both inside and outside the forest is bound to go up, causing massive disturbance to birdlife,” she explained. An online petition to declare the forest around Sattal as a conservation reserve has received over 11,300 signatures. Aagnay Budhraj, the Sattal resident who started the campaign, said, “The difference between reserve forests and conservation forests is that only the forest department can make decisions regarding the former. For decisions on a conservation forest, local residents have to be taken in the loop. These forests (around Sattal) cannot be allowed to be destroyed in the name of beautification. The aim is to preserve the flora and fauna, which is also a source of income for local communities in the region.” Authorities meanwhile assured that all stakeholders had been consulted before the project was initiated and that the beautification and landscaping work would not disturb the local ecology. “We had held a meeting with around 60 stakeholders from the area and concluded that the project will not damage the local ecology at all. In fact, the interpretation centre, which is nothing more than a shed-like structure, is not even part of the current project,” said Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam (KMVN) managing director Rohit Meena.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/locals-environmentalists-oppose-beautification-of-sattal-lake/articleshow/82107715.cms||Prashant Jha

There is a need to increase cyber literacy keeping in mind the current requirements along with making the public aware about online behaviour, said Director General of Police M L Lather on Friday while inaugurating the month-long cyber safety campaign on the occasion of Rajasthan Police Foundation Day under joint aegis of Rajasthan Police Academy (RPA), UNICEF and Cyber Peace Foundation at Police Headquarters. During the campaign, programmes including virtual seminars will be organized for wider public awareness on cyber security. Lather said that there is a need to make the public aware of cyber related laws and cyber crimes as well as the precautions to be taken to prevent cyber crimes. During the Corona period, internet is being widely used in trade, education, payment and other activities. When cyber awareness is low, people could become victims of cyber crime, he said. Lather said Rajasthan police has made an app about prevention of crimes against women and children. Rajasthan citizens and other apps are available on the website of Rajasthan Police and the public can download and use them. He informed that cyber units are functioning in every district. This unit conducts research on cyber crimes worth up to Rs 5 lakh. Research on cyber crimes over this amount is conducted by cyber police stations formed under SOG. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/need-to-increase-cyber-literacy-among-public/articleshow/82108387.cms||---

Rishabdeo SHO Yogesh Chauhan said due to the severity of the collision, the coal load caught fire and the flames engulfed the cabin of the trailing vehicle. The flames were so intense that it spread within minutes and the container driver and helper could not come out of the cabin and were burnt alive. A large traffic jam prevailed for a while. Rescue teams arrived and pulled out the burnt bodies that were shifted to mortuary. The vehicles were removed with the help of a crane and commutation was restored on the highway. Over speed is told to be the reason for collision. The bodies are yet to be identified, police are tracing the details of the container owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/driver-helper-burnt-alive-in-mishap/articleshow/82108412.cms||---

Municipal data showed that the number of Covid cases in Thane city was 75,229 on March 28, which crossed one lakh on April 14, clocking nearly 18 days. In comparison, Kalyan city took 19 days to add 25,000 cases from March 27. The slowest growth of cases in Thane city was in the first lap of the pandemic when it took nearly five months for the numbers to swell up to 25,000 between March 12 and August 27, while the subsequent jump to 50,000 took around three months till November 23. The spate of infection slowed down post-Diwali and it took nearly four months to add 25,000 cases between November 2020 and March 28. The death rate at 88 was also higher in Thane as compared to Kalyan which registered only 61 deaths in the duration of clocking 25,000 cases. Thane civic officials said they were working on ensuring stern compliance of the curfew so that the patient load is reduced and also towards reducing the mortality rate as well by intensifying contact tracing. “The load on civic facilities is increasing and we are trying our best to ensure patients don’t suffer inconvenience,” said an official. KDMC officials pointed out that their death rate is lower in comparison to Thane and oth-er cities in the metropolitan region. An official said, “Even th-ough the patient numbers are rising rapidly, only 61 deaths were reported in the last 19 days, which is only 0.2% of 25,000 patients. The overall death rate in the city is only 1.3%.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-thane-and-kalyan-added-25000-cases-in-18-19-days/articleshow/82109077.cms||Manoj Badgeri

---||Surat||13 fleeing with forged RT-PCR reports held||Surat: Valsad police booked 13 people on Thursday for trying to enter Gujarat through Bhilad check-post using fake RT-PCR reports. An unidentified agent from Mumbai was also booked for forging the reports. Police said that the 13 passengers travelling together in a private luxury bus had procured the fake report to travel back to their native places in Rajasthan. The passengers told police that due to the outbreak of cases in Mumbai, they all had decided to head back to Rajasthan. However, getting a report of RT-PCR would take a few days in Mumbai, hence they approached the manager of the travel company in whose bus they were travelling. The manager took the details of their Aadhar card and handed them all negative reports. “On scanning the QR codes on the report, we could know that their reports were fake. Later they all admitted that they did not undergo RT-PCR tests,” said a police official. Police have found the contact number of the manager through whom the reports were forged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/13-fleeing-with-forged-rt-pcr-reports-held/articleshow/82108320.cms||---
---||Nagpur||3-fold rise in cremations, delay at ghats increases waiting period for hearses||Nagpur: The staff at the city’s crematoria has been far busier over the past few weeks than any time earlier. Last rites at Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s 16 crematoria (with 150 platforms, 3 LPG and 2 diesel cremation machines) have seen a huge rise in numbers – from 60-70 a day to over 200 now. Data procured from NMC’s solid waste management department showed that the first three months of 2021 saw 7,468 last rites being performed. The rise in cremations has also led to a near seven-fold rise in the consumption of firewood. For performing last rites, 300kg firewood is required and 10kg cow dung cakes. In non-Covid times, the NMC used to provide approximately 21,000 kg firewood per day for performing last rites. Now, it is using up almost 1.40 lakh kg firewood a day, said a senior official who is looking after firewood stock in the city’s crematoria. The official claimed that the stock of firewood is sufficient and there is no scarcity even though the city has witnessed increase in deaths due to Covid. He said cremating bodies on firewood or cow dung cakes takes almost a day, while LPG and diesel crematoriums can cremate at least 10 bodies daily. To overcome the current scenario, NMC is all set to set up a diesel crematorium at Manewada ghat, the officer said. At present, NMC runs LPG crematoria at Ambazari, Mokshadham and Sahakar Nagar ghats, while Gangabai and Vaishali Nagar ghats have diesel crematoria. Though the civic body lacks platforms at crematoria, at this point of time NMC has no plans to acquire or start any new cremation grounds in the city limits. The civic body is utilizing 15 vehicles to ferry bodies from hospitals to cremation grounds – which too are falling short, said an officer requesting anonymity. He said it takes almost two hours for a vehicle to shift bodies from hospitals to cremation grounds. So the waiting period in hospitals to shift bodies too has increased, the officer claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/3-fold-rise-in-cremations-delay-at-ghats-increases-waiting-period-for-hearses/articleshow/82108402.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Nagpur||Cops increase presence on key roads, junctions||Nagpur: Refraining from taking tough measures against citizens who are not observing the new rules and regulations issued by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation, the cops adopted a fresh strategy on Friday to increase their presence on key roads and junctions. They stepped up one-to-one checking to enforce the Covid curbs which have been extended till end of April. Around 2,224 vehicles were detained by the cops. Around 735 were pulled up for not wearing masks and another 1,282 for violations of Covid distancing norms. City police chief Amitesh Kumar, who had pulled up the cops on Thursday for being slack, himself hit the streets twice on Friday. He was at eight spots including Old Katol Naka and Mominpura where public had resisted the restrictions to keep establishments shut. “We were strict at key arterial roads and junctions. The motorists and bikers were not allowed to pass through the nakabandis without verification,” said Kumar. Zonal DCPs — Lohit Matani in Central Nagpur (Itwari and Mominpura) and Vinita S in the West, had spent considerable time on the roads. DCPs Noorul Hassan and Vivek Masaaltoo led the screening of the moving crowds and vehicles at different places. The nuisance detection squad of Nagpur Municipal Corporation on Friday remained vigilant and continued to crack its whip against violators of ‘break the chain’. The NDS team led by its commandant Viresen Tambe penalized 16 establishments for disobeying Covid-19 orders. Violators included wine shops, sweet mart, ready-made clothes centre and hardware shops. Rs1.30 lakh was recovered from them. The civic cops from Gandhibagh zone penalized five establishments and recovered Rs 60,000 fine from the violators. Dharampeth zone too fined four establishments including a doctor’s clinic for disobeying Covid-19 distancing and mask.

He also said that there’s a 90% decline in the number of tourists entering the state. Lobo told reporters that the new wave is having a huge impact on the tourism industry. “The situation is such due to mini-lockdowns and night curfew measures taken by Maharashtra, Karnataka and Delhi.” The minister said the number of tourists in Panaji and the Calangute coastal belt, which he represents, has gone down by 90%. He added that tourists don’t want to take a risk and visit other states to stay in hotels and guesthouses because they are worried about their family at home. Speaking on the rise in Covid cases, the Calangute MLA said that the vaccination drive in the state will continue. “Four of my friends who have taken the vaccine got Covid, but they are at home. On the first day they got fever and bodyache, but after that, they don’t have any problem,” he said, adding that “lockdown is not the solution”. Lobo further said that if everyone took the vaccine, it would help control the spread of coronavirus. He added that after the 45-plus age group is completed, vaccinations will start for those below 45.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/covid-19-spike-has-driven-tourism-down-90-lobo/articleshow/82109088.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Blackmarketers stole Remdesivir from bedside of dead patients||NAGPUR: The alleged mastermind of the Remdesivir black-marketing racket, Kunal Kohde, is learnt to have stolen several vials of the anti-viral injections from the bedside of dead patients at his hospital at Deo Nagar Chowk. He would sell these Remdesivir vials at exorbitant prices, almost double or more above the already inflated MRPs of the crucial drug, which is in acute short supply. Guardian minister Nitin Raut and district collector Ravindra Thakare on Friday urged Covid hospitals to maintain Remdesivir stock registers and review it regularly. The city police had exposed the ward boy or brother-doctor nexus behind the black-marketing of the injections a day ago. Kohde was arrested along with Dr Lokesh Shahu of a Kamptee-based hospital, Shubham Mohudure and Sumeet Bangde on Friday. The four were arrested by the special squad of Zonal DCP Neelotpal from different places following a tip-off received by CP Amitesh Kumar. Subsequently, searches and questioning had taken place at three different hospitals. Two more doctors are learnt to be under scanner. “We may make more arrests in the coming days. Prima facie the racket was operated by ward boys and brothers, who knew each other. Our action on one racket was an alarm for others,” said the CP. The four arrested, who have been remanded till April 20 by the court, had stolen 35 Remdesivir vials and sold them to different persons in the last fortnight. Kohde’s accomplice and former senior at nursing college Bangde had a different modus operandi. He would steal Remdesivir injections from patients whose doses were discontinued by doctors after their condition showed improvement. It’s learnt Bangde had stolen eight vials from the hospital in the last four days. CCTV footage seized by the cops shows Bangde wearing a PPE kit and heading towards the medicine stock from where Remdesivir vials were stolen. According to senior police officials, names of more doctors were coming to fore but their roles are yet to be ascertained. “Dr Sahu had procured six vials to begin with from Kohde, who was his former colleague at the Kamptee hospital. Later, he had been behind more until police trapped him near Dragon Palace along with Mohdure. After the arrest of Sahu, the rest of the racket was exposed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/remdesivir-blackmarketers-stole-drug-from-bedside-of-dead-patients/articleshow/82108431.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Task force omits plasma therapy but doctors still prescribing it||Mumbai: Convalescent plasma therapy has been omitted from treatment guidelines recently released by the state Covid task force in April. Clinical trials, both national and international, have found little or no benefits of using plasma either in reducing mortality or severity. But patients are routinely prescribed plasma, forcing relatives to run from pillar to post, scurrying for donors.Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the task force, said, “Plasma is as good as out as no studies have found it to be beneficial, barring in a small subset of patients very early in the disease.” In most cases, patients seldom reach hospitals or are even detected with Covid in that window. Doctors previously said it helped to improve clinical outcome in limited cases, progressing from mild to moderate, but had no impact in moderate to severe cases. Joshi said doctors should refrain from indiscriminately advising it to everyone. “Although, in very selective cases, if the clinician feels there is a compelling reason to administer it, they may do so under compassionate grounds,” he added. “Globally, it is also being talked about that plasma therapy could contribute to mutations,” he said, adding that the task force was trying to circulate guidelines among as many doctors as possible. A clinical trial by Indian Council of Medical Research had found no reduction in progression to severe Covid-19 or all cause mortality. A trial helmed by Maharashtra government called ‘Platina’ was halted over high mortality numbers. But, Thane resident Nirupama Sharma said her 54-year-old mother-in-law was recommended plasma last week. The doctor said she needed it as her lungs were badly affected. After nearly 50 phone calls, the family got the first unit in a day and the second after one-and-a-half days from a blood bank in Mulund and south Mumbai respectively. “It was harrowing, but when a doctor tells you it can help, you want to do everything to get it,” she said.Although there is a demand for plasma it is less compared to the first wave, said Dr Kishore Jha of Mahatma Gandhi Seva Mandir Blood Bank. “We get 500 calls but can provide less than 3-5 units. Interestingly, unlike the first wave, 70%-80% don’t have enough Covid antibodies now,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-task-force-omits-plasma-therapy-but-doctors-still-prescribing-it/articleshow/82109097.cms||---

All these replicas will be made out of recycled waste. The Noida Authority is also preparing the design of a waste-to-wonder park in Sector 114, officials said.The three structures — the ghats of Varanasi, Taj Mahal and Dhamek Stupa — have been established off the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway near Mahamaya flyover to greet the commuters visiting the city. TOI has learnt that work is on to design models of Bada Imambara in Lucknow, Jhansi Fort, Krishna Janmabhoomi in Vrindavan and Buddha temple of Kushinagar. “Replicas of several other important monuments situated in various parts of Uttar Pradesh will be made. The horticulture department is also working on setting up a dedicated park in Sector 114, which will be themed on the waste-to-wonder concept,” said Authority CEO Ritu Maheshwari.The Authority put recycled waste material to creative use for the first time in October 2019 by placing a 20-feet tall charkha near the Mahamaya flyover. While plastic waste is used as the primary bottle, wood and metal are also being put to use. The design and size of the replicas have been finalised by private consultants engaged by the Authority to prepare the monuments.“We are also thinking of asking students and residents to prepare creative items through recycled waste. The best items could be placed at the Sector 114 park,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/recycled-waste-to-build-replicas-of-monuments/articleshow/82109085.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Virus fear: Cataract patients in eye of Covid-19 storm||Hyderabad: With the fear of Covid-19 keeping people away from regular check-ups, eye disorders have seen a significant rise in numbers, say city ophthalmologists. According to them, majority of the cases comprise advanced cataracts and dry eyes — either a result of delayed treatment or loss of work-life balance due to work-from-home schedules. “In the last quarter of 2019, only 10% of all cataract patients visiting the hospital were suffering from advanced cataract. But in the last quarter of 2020, this figure jumped to 50%, a five-fold increase. The cases of dry eyes due to digital eye strain similarly shot from 10% to 30%-50% over the same period,” said Dr Gaurav Arora, regional medical director (Telangana), of Dr Agarwal’s Eye Hospital. “We also noticed worsening of existing cases of glaucoma among many patients as they hesitated to come for regular follow-ups. There were also complications in previous corneal transplant patients, such as rejection of cornea and high eye pressure,” Arora added. In one such case, a 70-year-old man who was diagnosed with cataract in the first week of February 2020 was found to have lost 70% of his vision, when he turned up for check-up recently. Doctors attending to him said that he had put his regular follow-ups on hold for an entire year, as he was scared to visit the hospital amid rising Covid cases. Doctors had to perform a very complicated surgery on the patient to save his vision. But this is not a stray case, ophthalmologists reiterated, saying many patients suffering from diabetes too ignored their periodic eye check-ups during the pandemic, leading to severe complications in their retina. “I find that a lot of patients from all walks of life, including those with diabetes, delayed diagnosis or treatment of a disease as they were afraid of contracting Covid-19. People are more scared of the virus that has a mortality rate of 3%-4% than an advanced stage of cataract or glaucoma, which might lead to permanent loss of vision if not treated in time,” said Dr Ravi Chandra, consultant ophthalmologist, Dhrishti Eye Clinic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/virus-fear-cataract-patients-in-eye-of-covid-19-storm/articleshow/82108438.cms||Moulika.KV

It is the second time in 13-month pandemic that fatalities have crossed 1,000 in a month, the last time being September last year. The district also saw 75 Covid dying in the district on Friday, which is the highest in a day in the entire pandemic. Of these, 37 were residents of the city. Nagpur Rural registered 31 deaths, which was the highest-ever in a day for it, the previous highest being 30, a day ago. The previous high for deaths in the district was 74, on Thursday. Excluding one day (April 3, 47 deaths) all days in April have registered over 50 fatalities. Deaths were above 70 on three days: 73 on April 8, 74 on April 15, and 75 on April 16. The district is witnessing second wave since third week of February. There were 177 deaths in February and started to rise in March (763). High number of fatalities are being recorded since beginning of April. Total number of fatalities in 16 days of April is 1,011. Till now, highest number of deaths were registered in September last year (1,465), which was the peak of the first wave. If deaths continue at the current rate, April will have the highest fatalities in the pandemic. Cumulative deaths surged to 6,109 in the district, placing the district fourth among 35 districts in the state to cross 6,000 fatalities. The case fatality rate (CFR) is low at 1.22% in April due to high number of cases. April has recorded 83,005 cases in 16 days, which is more than all the monthly totals in past 13 months. Highest CFR was 3.8% in August last year, with high number of deaths and fewer cases. There had been 919 deaths as against 24,163 cases. The district on Friday also registered highest-ever single day recoveries of 5,894. Previous high was 4,634 a day ago. Also, active cases (64,335) on Friday were the highest in a day in the pandemic. Previous high was 64,110 a day ago. Shortage of beds is likely to increase further due to consistent rise in active cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dist-crosses-1k-covid-deaths-in-just-16-days-of-april/articleshow/82108443.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Ludhiana||Doctors clear rumours about Covid vaccine||Ludhiana: To dispel the rumours, hoaxes or superstitions surrounding the Covid-19 vaccine, the Ludhiana administration has come together with the medical specialists to boost the vaccination among the eligible.On Friday, deputy commissioner (DC) Varinder Kumar Sharma interviewed a panel of three specialist doctors — Dr Bishav Mohan, Dr Harminder Singh Pannu and Dr Kiran Gill Ahluwalia, Covid nodal officer Ludhiana on the Facebook page of district administration. The doctors stressed that Covid vaccine reduces severity of illness, even if the person gets an infection after taking the vaccine and reduces the chances of hospitalisation. They further emphasised that the vaccine will help to build the herd immunity hence it would help to contain the pandemic. They also said the vaccines does not lead to infertility. The doctors also said some residents are avoiding vaccination due to the myth that they have to avoid consuming alcohol for over a month, which is not true. On the question of one of the residents, whether a heart/kidney patient can take vaccine, answering this, Dr Mohan said they can take the vaccine and there is no need to stop blood thinner. Dr Pannu explained about the efficiency of current two Covid vaccines on new mutant variants and made it clear that both Covishield and Covaxin are very much effective against new variants.She also debunked the misinformation about difference between vaccines being administrated in government and private hospitals and said it is government, which is supplying the vaccine to the private hospitals. On a question when the Covid will be over, they said that it mostly depends upon the people as how they tackle it. They told that as much as we will continue to adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour, the pandemic will be contained at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/doctors-clear-rumours-about-covid-vaccine/articleshow/82107781.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Entire families getting infected this time: Doctors||KOLKATA: The second Covid wave has seen entire families getting infected, rather than one or two members that had been the case during the first wave. This new phenomenon is not restricted to the city and its surroundings. Even hospitals in the districts are getting an increasing number of such cases. Doctors have blamed high infectivity behind the trend this time. A doctor at the Covid ward of state-run MR Bangur Hospital saw a 60-year-old patient breaking down while talking to someone over the phone. The doctor went to the patient to remind him that he was supposed to wear the mask and also to find out why he was howling. “I found out that the patient’s entire family of three had been infected and he just got the information that his son in his late 20s had died during treatment,” said the doctor. “An elderly couple from Howrah got infected along with their son and daughter. While the couple who had been vaccinated with their first dose and the daughter could be managed in the general ward, the son who is in his early 40s had to be managed in the critical care section,” said Saswati Sinha, critical care specialist at AMRI Hospitals, Dhakuria. “We have had a few cases of entire family getting infected in the past couple of weeks, including a four-year-old kid who got infected along with their parents. This is the reason we have been propagating the need to stay cautious. The need is even more important on the face of this onslaught,” said paediatrician Raj Shekhar Maity, nodal officer for Covid care at Diamond Harbour Medical College. Health experts felt the infection could have been brought home by a member who regularly goes out of home but had not been adhering to Covid-19 prevention norms like a wearing a mask, maintaining social distancing and sanitizing hands regularly. For example, in case of the MR Bangur case, the son had played Holi with friends and started throwing up symptoms a few days after the festival. “During the previous wave, people were more conscious about adhering to the Covid-appropriate behaviour. Now, everyone has thrown caution to the wind as if the virus does not exist any longer. With a virus that is more infective, it is only obvious that people in close proximity of an infected person, neither of whom is taking preacaution, are contracting the virus,” said infectious diseases specialist Yogiraj Raj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/entire-families-getting-infected-this-time-docs/articleshow/82107788.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Goa||GMC’s plasma donation drive hits a wall||Panaji: The Goa Medical College’s (GMC) plasma donation campaign for Covid-19 patients has taken a beating with donors not coming forward even as the state is witnessing a huge rise in infections. The hospital gets one or two donors a day, which is not sufficient to meet demand in view of the rising cases. A GMC doctor said that nowadays the number of people coming forward to donate plasma has reduced. Hospital staff contact people who have recovered from Covid-19 and ask them if they are willing to donate plasma, but the response has been anything but encouraging, the doctor said. With the rise in cases since last month, there have been appeals in circulation on social media, seeking plasma donors. Plasma therapy was used during the first phase of the pandemic last year. While initially the response to the campaign was lukewarm, it improved after the government declared that a plasma donor will be entitled to a free medical check and treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gmcs-plasma-donation-drive-hits-a-wall/articleshow/82109144.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Slow vax drive may lead to faster mutation of virus, put non-inoculated section at risk||Kolkata: The slowdown in the Covid inoculation drive due to vaccine shortage can lead to faster mutation of the virus and pose a challenge to the plan to combat the pandemic through mass vaccination. “If vaccination is slow and the time span to inoculate a significant segment of the population is long, then the objective to develop protection for a sufficient number of people may fail as the virus would have mutated many times by then,” said Sangam Banerjee, a former senior professor at Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics who has worked on non-enzymatic bio-sensors and bactericidal activities using nanomaterials. The vaccination drive has taken a hit in the past week with several sites being temporarily shut down due to low stock. On Wednesday, the state announced that priority would be accorded to persons coming for the second dose. Pointing out that the inherent nature of the virus is to mutate, John C Martin Centre for Liver Research & Innovations Kolkata director (clinical research) Santanu Kumar Tripathi, who is also principal investigator of Covovax phase 2/3 clinical trial, said that while a virus mutates even if there is no threat to it, the mutation can get accelerated when it encounters a vaccine. Just like resistance to antibiotics can happen if drugs are not administered properly, in case of vaccines, it can lead to immune escape — where new strains and their multiplication cannot be stopped. The originally identified SARS-CoV-2 (labelled D614) found first in Wuhan in 2019 has mutated into UK, Brazil, South Africa and other varieties. Vaccines are developed to target a particular pathogen. When injected, antibodies are developed that are programmed to recognize and eradicate a virus. But if a virus mutates, the antibodies are unable to identify it, rendering the vaccine ineffective. However, Tripathi cautioned that until evidence is generated, such concerns should not hold back the vaccination campaign. Banerjee further said imperfect vaccinal antibodies could turn recipients into asymptomatic virus spreaders and lead to a large source for infecting the non-immunized segments of the population. Some virologists also said the virus was targeting the youth in the second wave because it was a less hostile host than the elderly population, many of whom have got vaccinated. “The mutations may have changed the inherent character of the virus and the choice of hosts. The virus load has also increased since the first wave. The youth who were resistant to smaller doses of the virus are now getting infected due to the higher dosage,” said National Institute of Biomedical Genomics Kalyani associate professor Sreedhar Chinnaswamy, an immunologist who is of the opinion that natural immunity acquired through infection offers far greater resistance to the virus than vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/slow-vax-drive-may-lead-to-faster-mutation-of-virus-put-non-inoculated-section-at-risk/articleshow/82107797.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||From 982 on March 31, number of daily new Covid cases may rise 20-fold by April end in West Bengal||KOLKATA: For the past three days, the number of fresh cases has been rising by close to 1,000 each day. From 4,817 fresh cases on April 13, the number shot up to 5,892 the next day and then to 6,769 on Thursday. Going by this surging numbers, health experts fear the number of daily cases will touch the 20,000 mark in about two weeks from now. On Friday, however, 6,910 cases — the highest single-day spike so far in Bengal — were reported from across the state, a rise of 141 from the previous day. But then, the number of samples tested was 40,153, which was around 2,000 less than the previous day. On March 31, there were 982 fresh cases. If the number rises to 20,000 by the end of this months — as the experts fear — there would be a nearly 20-fold jump in fresh cases this month. “Going by the leaping numbers, we could be struck by a Tsunami by the time the polling comes to an end. The mass congregation during political rallies and meetings is definitely playing a catalyst to the virus that has more infectivity this time,” said Sumon Poddar, associate professor at the Institute of Child Health. “The number of actual positive cases would be more than double of what is being reported right now. Apart from Kolkata and North 24 Parganas, no substantial amount of samples are being tested from other districts. These undetected cases will only make the situation worst,” said a senior doctor with a government Covid hospital. While Kolkata and North 24 Parganas are still the only districts reporting cases in four digits, neighbouring Howrah and South 24 Parganas, too, is seeing a sharp rise. “Strict adherence to Covid behaviour, identifying hotspots and then putting such places under containment are a few strategies that could break the chain while boosting the health infrastructure,” said infectious diseases specialist Yogiraj Ray. “The pandemic's second wave has challenged Bengal's economic, medical and public health infrastructure. The nature of virus has changed, may be due to mutation and this is going to affect our approach towards the disease. In this time of crisis, people should stick to Covid-appropriate behaviour, otherwise we will face severe consequences in near future,” said public health specialist Anirban Dalui. Diptendra Sarkar, a professor of surgery at SSKM Hospital, felt the need was to look at rising cases nationally and internationally. “The UK strain caused the second wave in India. It started from Mumbai, Kerala and Punjab and then the whole of India. Unless there is a holistic approach, we will be on the verge of a breakdown. There must be a strategy and campaign for door-to-door vaccination for two weeks and vaccinate lakhs in a week,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/from-982-on-march-31-number-of-daily-new-cases-may-rise-20-fold-by-april-end/articleshow/82107792.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

As per the earlier released schedule, the last working day for schools, for the academic year 2020-21 is May 26 — the last day of SSC exams. “When the state has already announced cancellation of SSC examinations, it doesn’t make any sense to ask us to continue attending school. The state should either declare a vacation so that the next academic year can start from June 1 or give us an option to work from home,” said Chava Ravi, general secretary, United Teachers Federation. Teachers said that even if they have to continue to oversee virtual classes or take care of other work, they should be given the option of doing so from their house. “The virus is spreading rapidly as now. Under such circumstances, teachers should not be asked to risk their lives by physically attending school. All the work can be taken care of from home,” said M Ravinder, general secretary, Telangana Progressive Teachers Federation (TPTF). He added that the teachers are putting even their family members’ lives at risk by going to school , at such a time. They said that as per previous orders, they might have to go to school at least until April 24.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-teachers-demand-vacation-or-wfh-option/articleshow/82108455.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 5+ cases in big society? Local body to decide on sealing it||Here are answers to some frequently asked questions released by the state government on Thursday on the restrictions imposed till May 1. Q: For a very large housing society with Covid-positive cases, should we include the entire complex as a micro-containment zone? A: If there are more than five cases in a campus, it has to be declared as a micro-containment zone. If a society is very large, then the local authority should decide whether all the cases are in such a limited area that they can be practically isolated (no porous boundary) as a micro-containment zone.  Q: Can private vehicles ply during the day time to work or office ? A: If their office or workplace has been allowed to operate as per the orders issued by the state government, they can travel to work by a private vehicle. Q: Will general public be allowed to use local trains? What constitutes valid reason ? A: Yes, only if they have a valid reason to travel. Valid reason will include travel for essential services as per government order or an emergency.  Q: What about long-distance trains ? A: These are essential services and will continue to operate. Anyone may travel on these. Q: What are the rules for roadside food vendors? A: Roadside vendors are allowed to provide both parcels and home delivery (although home delivery by them is very rare) between 7am and 8pm. Q: Can people use packers and movers? A: This is not in general a valid reason. What is not immediately essential must be avoided. If there is a very genuine reason and very essential, local disaster management authority may allow. This is expected to be very exceptional though.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-5-cases-in-big-society-local-body-to-decide-on-sealing-it/articleshow/82109131.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Deployed on crowded trains, TTEs face Covid danger||NAGPUR: With Indian Railways not following its own protocol of allowing passengers in trains with only confirmed tickets, the travelling ticket examiners (TTEs) and checking staff are becoming vulnerable to Covid-19. When the pandemic is surging again, TTEs are being posted aboard trains with RPF staff for special ticket checking programme. They directly have to face passengers who are overcrowding trains to leave for their hometowns owing to lockdown-type restrictions in Maharashtra. “The passengers do not know whether they are positive. Many just take paracetamol tablets to keep body temperature under control,” said some affected TTEs. Till now around 100 TTEs and their family members have been hit by Covid. “When beds are not available in government or private hospitals and the railway hospital is not treating Covid employees, deploying TTEs aboard trains is sending them to their death,” said angry family members. Cashing in on overcrowding, the SECR has drawn up a ticket checking programme between Nagpur-Gondia from April 15-18. Under it three TCs, two RPF men and a CTI are deployed to collect a fine from passengers without ticket or reservation. Several trains towards Howrah direction are overcrowded and no social distancing is being followed. Asked about overcrowding in trains, SECR’s SrDCM Vikas Kashyap said, “It has to be verified at originating station. The ticket checking programme is a routine one and we have asked for contactless working. Mostly bona fide passengers are travelling in trains. We are focusing more on gate ticket checking.” However, officials told TOI, TCs are even collecting a fine of Rs 60,000 in a day from ticketless travellers. The railway rules say that such passengers have to be deboarded at the next station but TCs are issuing tickets up to Howrah to such passengers. Kashyap said, “There is a human angle to it. If we deboard such passengers, where will they go as train frequency is already low. Secondly, the online duty of TCs is needed to resolve grievances of passengers during the journey.” However, Kashyap’s own office is under the grip of coronavirus as 17 employees have tested positive and one has died.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/deployed-on-crowded-trains-ttes-face-covid-danger/articleshow/82108459.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

It will start its services with 50 beds, including 10 ICU beds. The hospital on Friday said any child found positive for Covid-19 can be admitted with immediate effect.Meanwhile, the nodal officer in-charge of Covid care in the district, Narendra Bhooshan, directed all L1 category hospitals to be converted into L2 facilities at the earliest. Also, L1 facilities will be equipped with oxygen support.“The OPD services are shut but the vaccinations will continue,” said Dr Ajit Kumar, spokesperson, Sharda hospital. He added that those who require routine treatment in OPD will be provided a telemedicine facility while only serious patients will be treated in emergency.Additionally, all people visiting the hospital will be thermally screened. Additional guards have been deployed to ensure social distancing norms and violators will be fined up to Rs 1,000.At GIMS, chief medical superintendent (CMS) Dr Saurabh Srivastava said since the hospital has over 200 Covid patients, it’s no longer possible to continue OPD facilities. “We have suggested a hold on elective surgeries and only emergency cases will be attended,” said Dr Srivastava.“SSPHPGTI is being prepared to be a Covid hospital but it will continue with the non-Covid facilities. Paediatric Covid-19 positive cases will be admitted on the 4th floor of the hospital,” said Dr BP Singh, emergency medical officer, SSPHPGTI.We await the government’s permission to run both types of treatment in one building.

Only around 10% of the ICU beds available in the city—mostly in private hospitals—are vacant. Officials though claim that capacity is being increased day by day. The situation could be well understood from the fact that there is no vacant oxygen or ICU bed at Gandhi Medical College, likewise there is no ICU bed at Chirayu Medical College also, in AIIMs there are only around 5 vacant ICU beds. At BMHRC also there is no vacant ICU bed. In city’s JP hospital there is only one vacant ICU bed as on April 16. Overall close to 250 patients were on ventilator in the city on April 16, said sources. Officials however say that the situation is being closely monitored and appropriate measures are being taken. “There are less vacant ICU beds, but it is not fully occupied and we are adding to our capacity on a day to day basis in the district,” district collector Avinash Lavaniya said. He added, “Even the new covid care centres are adding beds on a day to day basis”. Sources said that despite the instructions of the chief minister the information related to bed availability in the city hospitals are not available in public domain. Meanwhile, sources said that the oxygen related issues continue to haunt the kin of the patients but administration has made preparations for it, six medical oxygen suppliers have been identified for the purpose of supplying oxygen to the requisite hospitals. Overall around 55 kilo litre of oxygen was supplied to the hospitals of the city on Friday, said sources.

---||Goa||ACL: FC Goa secure another famous draw, this time against Al Wahda||Margao: If the gritty draw in the opening game was good, this one was even better. FC Goa continued with their impressive debut in the AFC Champions League with a fighting goalless draw against Al Wahda, their second in as many group games at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Saturday. The performance was better too. Unlike the opening game, Juan Ferrando’s side created chances – largely on the counter – but it was goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh who helped keep a clean sheet with several saves, two of them in added time from close range. While it took Dheeraj’s goalkeeping to earn Goa a point in the end, the hosts could have earned more than a point. There were chances. All these chances came from counter-attacks. But while Goa got several looks at the rival goal, the final touch from Jorge Ortiz and substitute Devendra Murgaonkar was missing. Brandon Fernandes came closest late in the game. From an all-too-familiar counter, he found the ball at his feet just inside the box. The Goa winger struck the ball cleanly too, but everyone in orange rubbed their eyes in disbelief as the ball struck the post with goalkeeper Mohamed Alshamsi rooted to the ground. Al Wahda came close too. Far too many times, only to be denied by Dheeraj, or the excellent centre-back pairing of James Donachie and Ivan Gonzalez. Ask Omar Khirbin, a former Asian player of the year. Whether it was the Syrian striker’s header from point-blank range or his shot from handshaking distance in the final minute of added time, Dheeraj was simply unbeatable. Former United Arab Emirates (UAE) captain Imaeil Matar thought he had given Al Wahda the lead with a freekick, only to be denied by Dheeraj, yet again. Al Wahda had done their homework and knew exactly what to do. They knew Edu Bedia is the centrifugal force around whom this team revolves, so they afforded the Goa captain little space to receive the ball or run into spaces. With the likes of Khalil Ibrahim and Tim Matavz ready to press at the slightest of opportunity, Goa found it difficult to initiate moves from the back. The constant pressing led to opportunities for the visitors, although it was not until a corner-kick – tame header in the end – and a low drive from Matavz that the goalkeeper was tested. Goa’s plan was clearly to press high when needed. Chances, though, were few and far between in the opening 45 minutes. Ortiz ended shooting high and wide on one such instance. When there was a chance through a counter, Seriton Fernandes could not pick out the right player. Bedia then tried his luck from distance but the goalkeeper was so calm that he chested the ball. In the second half, the visitors were not so comfortable. The humidity made it difficult. That Goa did not take their chances was a different tale altogether. Goa now have two points from two games which would surprise a lot of fans. Not Ferrando. “I know my team. I work with these players everyday. I know what they can do,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/acl-fc-goa-secure-another-famous-draw-this-time-against-al-wahda/articleshow/82122217.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Elite Homz in Sector 77 has 45 active cases and the Apartment Owners’ Association (AOA) has decided to keep three oxygen cylinders on stand by. “These can be used free of cost in case of an emergency. We have been hearing that in case of elderly Covid patients, sometimes the condition deteriorates rapidly. The oxygen support will help them till the time they reach a hospital. There are several residents who are doctors and they have volunteered to help if needed,” said Sameer Sharma, AOA president, Elite Homz. He added that security guards have been asked to help Covid patients get medicines. “The owner of a local pharmacy is a resident here and the person is helping us with medicines. Patients can also call up the main gate security and a guard can get medicines for them,” Sharma added. Other societies are also keeping oxygen cylinders ready. “Almost all big complexes have swimming pools and it is mandatory for them to have oxygen cylinders . In our society, we have upgraded to a bigger cylinder,” said Rajiva Singh, president, Noida Federation of Apartment Owners’ Association (Nofaa). Logix Blossom County, Sector 137, has kept three oxygen cylinders for Covid patients.

---||Chandigarh||Punjab pays Rs 151 crore pending arrears of arhtiya||Chandigarh: The Punjab finance department on Friday released the pending arrears of Rs 151.45 crore to arhtiyas, following the directions of chief minister Amarinder Singh, A spokesperson said the Food Corporation of India (FCI) was supposed to pay the arrears to about 5,000 arthiyas but due to delay on its part, the Punjab government released the same from the state exchequer to ensure smooth and hassle-free wheat procurement during the ongoing rabi season. Before the commencement of wheat procurement, the arhtiyas had requested the chief minister to settle their arrears immediately. The finance department has released Rs. 151.45 crore on the condition that the food and civil supplies department would ensure crediting the amount back to the state exchequer, whenever it is returned by FCI. The FCI had withheld the commission after around 5,000 arhtiyas failed to comply with the public financial management system during the kharif Season 2019-20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-pays-rs-151-crore-pending-arrears-of-arhtiya/articleshow/82109159.cms||---
---||Bhopal||They Passed Covid Test With Flying Colours||Even as more and more fatalities due to Covid-19 infection are being reported, creating an atmosphere of panic among the people, there are plenty of examples where those who contracted Coronavirus infection were able to come out of it quickly because on suspecting the infection, they acted swiftly, strictly followed the medical protocol as advised by the doctor during “home isolation” and didn’t allow fear to overtake their determination to beat the Covid-19. TOI talked to some such people. Excerpts ‘Never felt I was seriously ill or any risk to my life’ Piyush Sharma, 55, entrepreneur I don’t know how I contracted the infection. I was not the only one, but both my brothers and majority of our family members fell ill due to the virus. Fortunately, my mother didn’t have the infection. We have a spacious house, so “home isolation” was not a problem. We consulted the doctor, we usually do, and he prescribed us medicines and suggested other things we should do. He had not asked us for HRCT to know if the virus has affected our lungs but we got it done on our own. There was infection in the chest and some other doctors, whom we talked to, advised that we should get admitted to the hospital, but our doctor was firm that it was not required, so we continued to be at home and eight days later, we had the negative report. I decided to get myself tested after I felt feverish and there was weakness in my body. I didn’t waste time and went to Bansal hospital for testing and once Coronavirus infection was detected, treatment began immediately and all of us were back to work within 10 days. I don’t remember the medicines he prescribed but steam therapy really helped in giving me relief, while I was under medication. Throughout the period of “home quarantine”, I never felt I was seriously ill or there was any risk to my life. Being combative when you are ill also helps. ‘Prayers, exercises helped me in defeating coronavirus’ Braj Sharma, 51, government servant A couple of days after Shivratri, I was feeling pain in the body. My wife was also not well. We both went for Covid-19 test, while my wife tested positive in a rapid antigen test, I had a negative report. However, Dr Lokendra Dave, who knows me, asked me to get myself tested again. And, the RT PCR test was positive. He sent me a prescription and asked for HRCT and some blood tests. After confirming nominal infection in the lungs, he prescribed me Fabiflu tablets (if I am correct), in addition to other tablets. Fabiflu 1800 Mg twice a day on the first day and it was to be progressively reduced- 800 Mg on the second day and 400 Mg on the third day...It was to remove infection in the lungs. Dr Dave said I can stay home with my son and wife, who were also positive. I continued with prayers, exercises and parayanam, while I was ill and after 12 days, I joined the duty back. Back to work in just a week Virendra Singh, 35, driver After “Sethji” for whom I work tested positive for Coronavirus, he asked me to get myself tested. I went to JP hospital for the test and when I was coming back, the doctor gave me some medicines and said you could remain at home but remain aloof and take the medicines as prescribed. I had bought Vitamin D and Vitamin C tablets from the market. All the other medicines, I was given from the hospital. I didn’t get any more tests done nor did I go anywhere for medical advice. I stayed at home for a week and after that, when ‘Sethji” got himself tested, I, too, was tested and the report was negative. The next day I was back to work. Hosp hassles could not deter him from beating Covid Rohit, 25, office boy at a pvt office After 2-3 persons in my office tested positive for Covid-19, I, too, got myself tested at JP hospital and the report was positive. There was a message on my mobile asking me to get admitted at Hamidia hospital. When I went to Hamidia hospital, the guard at the Covid Care Centre didn’t allow me to go in. He insisted I should bring the report from JP hospital because a message saying I was positive and I should get admitted at Hamidia hospital couldn’t be trusted. “If you don’t have the report (soft or hard copy), you will have to get a test done at Hamidia hospital and if you are found positive, you would be admitted in the TB hospital,” he said. I tried to persuade him but he didn’t budge. I remained there for an hour before I was called for testing. And, as I went for testing, the person on the computer said “Yes, you are positive. We have information from the JP hospital.” Then, I was shifted to TB hospital. By this time, I had started coughing vigorously. The doctors first gave me medicines to mitigate coughing. There were other medicines also. Doctors and other medical staff were good. After a week, I was discharged from the hospital with a negative Coronavirus report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/they-passed-covid-test-with-flying-colours/articleshow/82108466.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Farm labour crunch hits agriculture; industry||Barinderjit.Saluja Mohali: The farm labour crunch has hit harvesting season as migrants are making their way back to their native states again fearing another lockdown in the Tricity. Again, factory owners and farmers are grappling with labour crunch. The exodus this time is said to be driven by fear of being trapped in place due to another lockdown and panchayat elections in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Many small-time farmers in Mohali are finding it difficult to get farm labour and have involved their families in harvesting. Bhupinder Singh, a farmer at Mullanpur said, “The wheat crop is ripe and needs to be harvested but we are not getting farm labour. Most of them have migrated back to their native villages, probably due to the fear of being stuck here. We have to involve our families.” To make matters worse, the MeT department has predicted dust storm and rain in the next 48 hours, leaving farmers in a hurry to harvest the crop. A farmer from Derabassi, Lakhbir Singh said, “Daily wagers’ cost has escalated due to scarcity of farm labour, which has become unaffordable. We are already running into debt due to escalation of other farming cost and now farm labour wages have also gone high.” Last year, during the mass exodus, 73,559 migrants from Mohali were transported via Shramik Special trains to Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Bihar. Later, when lockdown was relaxed, they were transported back in state-owned roadways. BOX: Factory owners left high and dry Industrialists are also facing shortage of labour and finding it expensive to hire workers and helpers. Industrialists in Derabassi said they are getting helpers at the cost of skilled labour. Deepak Singh, an industrialist said, “We are not getting helpers as most of them are going back to their native places fearing lockdown. Those working here are also planning to move back or are asking for higher wages, which is unaffordable.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farm-labour-crunch-hits-agriculture-industry/articleshow/82107799.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||E-rickshaws to drive vaccine benefit message||Chandigarh:On the lines of the election campaign, e-rickshaws will ply on the city roads and spread public health message. These rickshaws will not praise any campaigner, but will announce the benefits of vaccination against Covid. Ten such e-rickshaws have been fabricated with messages displayed regarding the safety of the vaccines, measures to take after vaccination and where these vaccines will be provided free of cost. “These e-rickshaws will have audio messages on microphones which will be disseminated while they will roam around in different sectors. The concept is to reach to the community and allay their fears,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director health services, UT, While Punjab has roped in Sonu Sood for vaccination campaign, Chandigarh’s health department feels e-rickshaws will be able to reach out with both the message of clean air and safe vaccine in most of the sectors. Prior to the ‘tika utsav’ from April 7 to April 10, there were 16,366 beneficiaries vaccinated. During the festival, more than 11,297were vaccinated. “Even though the response during the tika utsav was not as expected, we have been able to develop systems which will sustain this campaign. We have four mobile teams, two of these will visit the offices for vaccination, while the others will visit areas which have smaller health care facilities like Kishangarh, Kaimbwala, Sector 40 and Khuda Lahora,” said Dr Kang. She said, “These facilities do not have more than two rooms for vaccination. The mobile teams will be able to keep the equipment and take help for areas from temples, gurdwara and dharamshala for its outreach vaccination programme.” Sources in the UT health department inform that by next week, the city will receive another consignment of vaccines. “We are not sure of the brand, but those who received the first dose as Covishield will receive the same vaccine,” said an official in the UT health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/e-rickshaws-to-drive-vaccine-benefit-message/articleshow/82107808.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Body cremated in residential colony in Neelbad||BHOPAL: Amid reports of crematoriums being overwhelmed in Bhopal, the sight of a body being cremated in the open inside a residential colony in Neelbad sparked horror among locals on Friday. The administration ordered an inquiry after a video of the illegal cremation went viral. Residents alleged it was a Covid victim but there is official confirmation of this yet. Bhopal collectorate spokesperson Arun Rathore told TOI, “It has come to our notice. We have asked officials to probe the complaint. Such cremations are not allowed at any cost. Crematoriums have been designated for Covid-infected bodies and cremating in this way is completely illegal.” Hari Nagar is on the city outskirts. A resident of this locality, Dheeraj Singh, said that the body was cremated next to a corporation water tank. “My home is only a few metres from where the body was burning. My family is scared of moving out. The administration should take strict action against such people and stop such cremations,” he said. “Such cremations have happened earlier as well. We wrote to the administration but nothing was done. Today, it got far more serious as a Corona-infected body was cremated,” alleged Dheeraj. Another resident said, “How can we drink water from the tank after watching the cremation right next to it? Ashes from the body fell on nearby houses. It sends shivers down my spine. We are scared of touching that ash. I appeal to the administration to save out lives,” said a resident, requesting not to be named. Locals pointed out that Bhopal Municipal Corporation has already allotted land for cremation in a nearby area. “Many residents in these parts are reluctant to go to Bhadbhada crematorium as it is almost 7km away. There are 5-6 smaller crematoriums near Neelbad, but they don’t want to go there, either. They simply cremate the body in colonies,” said Vikas, a Hari Nagar resident. ADM (Huzur), Akash Shrivastava, on the other hand, said that people of Neelbad have been cremating bodies over there for several years. “It should have been shifted elsewhere, but it’s yet to be done. That place has been a crematorium for several years,” he said. Asked how a cremation is allowed under a BMC water tank, Shrivastava said, “The crematorium existed before people built homes in the area. Residents have approached the administration to shift it. We will.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/body-cremated-in-residential-colony-in-neelbad/articleshow/82108492.cms||Ramendra Singh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Young make for big chunk of patients in 2nd wave||Mumbai: The second Covid wave has brought about a subtle change in age profile of patients admitted to hospitals. There are more younger people this time around. Doctors say the reason could be delay in seeking hospitalisation among youngsters or the fact that the 60-plus population has got vaccinated and are hence getting milder disease that doesn’t need hospitalisation. In BMC-run KEM Hospital in Parel, for instance, the under-35 age group made up for only 17% of admissions in 2020. However, in 2021, their proportion has increased to almost 27%. “There are quite a few patients in the 36-55 age group as well,” said KEM Hospital dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh. The difference is starker in the 35-bedded ICU section of Fortis Hospital, Mulund. “The average age of the patients in my ICU is less than 55 years,’’ said ICU in-charge Dr Rahul Pandit, who is also a member of the state government’s task force on Covid-19. In September 2020, the peak of the first wave, the average age of the patients was 70-plus years. While the younger population has always been the main carrier of Covid-19 because they step out for work, they were largely asymptomatic. “Although we don’t have any scientific evidence to prove that the virus is more dangerous now, there is no denying that the younger population makes up for a larger proportion of the admitted patient pool than before,” said a doctor working for a BMC hospital. There is possibly a change in the disease pattern. “The Covid cycle is usually two to three weeks long. For the first one week to 10 days, youngsters remain asymptomatic but then land up in hospital with a cytokine storm,” said Dr Pandit. Cytokine storms are a severe immune reaction in which the body releases too many cytokines or proteins into the blood too quickly. Another reason could be that the elderly have certain protection due to the vaccine. “More of the elderly have been vaccinated so far. Even if they get the infection after the vaccine, they may get a mild attack,” said Dr Pandit. ...there is no denying that younger population makes up for a larger proportion of the admitted patient pool than before||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-young-make-for-big-chunk-of-patients-in-2nd-wave/articleshow/82109161.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Nagpur||Cops increase presence on key roads, junctions||NAGPUR: Refraining from taking tough measures against citizens who are not observing the new rules and regulations issued by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation, the cops adopted a fresh strategy on Friday to increase their presence on key roads and junctions. They stepped up one-to-one checking to enforce the Covid curbs which have been extended till end of April. Around 2,224 vehicles were detained by the cops. Around 735 were pulled up for not wearing masks and another 1,282 for violations of Covid distancing norms. City police chief Amitesh Kumar, who had pulled up the cops on Thursday for being slack, himself hit the streets twice on Friday. He was at eight spots including Old Katol Naka and Mominpura where public had resisted the restrictions to keep establishments shut. “We were strict at key arterial roads and junctions. The motorists and bikers were not allowed to pass through the nakabandis without verification,” said Kumar. Zonal DCPs — Lohit Matani in Central Nagpur (Itwari and Mominpura) and Vinita S in the West, had spent considerable time on the roads. DCPs Noorul Hassan and Vivek Masaaltoo led the screening of the moving crowds and vehicles at different places. The nuisance detection squad of Nagpur Municipal Corporation on Friday remained vigilant and continued to crack its whip against violators of ‘break the chain’. The NDS team led by its commandant Viresen Tambe penalized 16 establishments for disobeying Covid-19 orders. Violators included wine shops, sweet mart, ready-made clothes centre and hardware shops. Rs1.30 lakh was recovered from them. The civic cops from Gandhibagh zone penalized five establishments and recovered Rs 60,000 fine from the violators. Dharampeth zone too fined four establishments including a doctor’s clinic for disobeying Covid-19 distancing and mask. It has also fined Rs 10,000 on Sonali Rane for keeping a parlour open at Bhagwagar Layout on Ambazari Road. Besides these 16 cases, the Ashi Nagar zone has imposed fine of Rs 15000 on Tirpude Hospital on Kamptee road for dumping bio medical waste with the garbage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-increase-presence-on-key-roads-junctions/articleshow/82108498.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Nagpur||Nagpur Municipal Corporation helplines turn helpless as Covid cases surge||NAGPUR: Ever since the sudden spike in Covid-19 cases, the helplines started by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) have turned helpless. Numerous calls for bed availability go unanswered, say aggrieved patients and their relatives. In some cases, the helpline is continuously busy. If by chance someone picks up the calls, the only answer patients and relatives get is ‘beds are full’. Even for availability of crucial drugs like Remdesivir or Tocilizumab injections, the NMC staffers don’t have any answers. In a couple of cases, the civic employees told patients and relatives to directly go to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) if beds were unavailable anywhere. However, when they reach there with the patient in an ambulance, the security guards don’t even allow them entry citing heavy rush inside the Covid ward. “After helpline guys told us to go straight to GMCH, we hired an ambulance and waited for a couple of hours outside. First the guards didn’t allow us in. After I requested that the patient is serious, they allowed me to go to the reception. But there I was clearly told to take my father home, as there were no beds. The ambulance driver charged us a hefty amount for just a couple of hours,” said a school employee, whose father needed a bed. She ultimately was forced to take the patient home and make arrangements for an oxygen cylinder there, as his SPO2 levels fell below 90. According to patients and relatives, even the portal started for providing real-time updates on bed vacancy was hardly of any use. Whenever they called the hospitals showing vacancy, they replied in the negative. “We’ve been trying for a bed since last couple of days and called every hospital where vacancies were shown, but the reply is always that there is no vacancy,” a relative of the patient said. Refuting the allegations, NMC additional municipal commissioner Jalaj Sharma said their helpline centre is handling many calls every day for various issues including allocation of beds. “As soon as a patient gets discharged, there’s a long waiting list and the bed fills up immediately. Every day more than 800 admissions are taking place which means that the same number of patients are getting beds on an average,” he said, adding that there is a lot of pressure from patients’ relatives for beds on the helpline personnel. On the charge that helplines don’t have answers about Remdesivir and other crucial drugs, Sharma clarified that their supply was handled by the collector’s office. “NMC has no role to play in its distribution,” he said. When asked why the helplines staffers suggested all patients to move to GMCH if beds were unavailable, the commissioner said it was the most preferred for Covid-19 treatment by most. “On Thursday, we received 96 calls for bed allocation, and 42 were given admission in hospitals, while 22 people didn’t respond to calls later made by NMC’s helpline centre. Three people were advised home isolation, while 26, who failed to get a bed, were later home isolated. Almost 90 to 95 % calls made to NMC’s helpline centre are being addressed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-helplines-turn-helpless-as-covid-cases-surge/articleshow/82108495.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Nagpur||Only 2,500 respond to Maharashtra school fee campaign||NAGPUR: Only 2,500-odd responses were received to the state government’s move which sought suggestions regarding amendments to the existing law that governs school fee. Considering that over a crore students are enrolled in schools across the state, the shockingly low number of responses has come as a surprise for education officials. These suggestions were being collected by a special committee set up by the state government to see what changes can be made to the existing Maharashtra Education Institutes (Regulation of Fee) Act, which is popularly known among parents as School Fee Act. Set up on March 13, the committee comprised nine members, all of whom employed with the state education department. A senior education official told TOI that the response was indeed disappointing. “We were expecting around a lakh responses, if not more. But the final numbers which came in show that many parents organizations are interested only in talking and protesting, but back off when time comes to take action,” said the official. The fee committee’s mandate was to study existing school fee laws in other states, study previous committee reports, take suggestions from stakeholders and suggest what changes need to be made to make Maharashtra’s law stronger. This committee was set up as a result of increasing friction between schools and parents over the fee issue. Various cabinet ministers were being flooded with letters from parents regarding school fee issue, complaining that local education officials were not “doing enough”. Top education officials noticed that the current law lacked teeth needed to produce results which parents’ organizations will be happy with. In a statement issued last month, the education department had said local officials were finding it difficult to implement the Act and hence amendments were needed. An education official told TOI that this entire thing was being done at the behest of parents. “It was various parents organizations who met with school education minister and pressed for changes in the Act. So when we requested them to send suggestions, the least they could do is fill the online form and send their suggestions,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/only-2-5k-respond-to-maha-school-fee-campaign/articleshow/82108501.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Gandhi Hospital made designated Covid-19 hospital again||HYDERABAD: With a more number of Covid-19 patients rushing to hospitals, the government has decided to convert the state-run Gandhi Hospital into a Covid-19 designated hospital from Saturday. Currently, on an average, one Covid-19 patient is being admitted every 10 minutes at the hospital. After the first wave of the pandemic, as the number of cases subsided, regular services were restored at Gandhi Hospital. Meanwhile, director of medical education Dr K Ramesh Reddy has tested positive for Covid-19. With the present rush at the hospital peaking, the government has made it clear that there will be no out-patient services in the hospital from Saturday. Just on Thursday alone, 150 patients were admitted. Other services will be stopped till the cases come down. The government also gave instructions to send emergency cases from Gandhi Hospital to other hospitals like Osmania Hospital. The government also gave instructions that all the critical cases of Covid-19 will be referred to Gandhi Hospital only. All non-urgent surgeries will be stopped and surgeries that were given specific dates will be rescheduled. Currently, 450 beds were occupied in Gandhi Hospital till Friday evening. The hospital has a total of 390 regular beds, out of which only 36 are occupied while 354 are vacant.

---||Pune||Pune: Medical infrastructure shortfalls upset patients’ relatives||PUNE: Neck-deep in Covid-care services, healthcare workers are encountering abusive arguments, rude behaviour or physical assault from patients’ relatives over the growing crisis of remdesivir, oxygen/ventilator beds, delay in test report and unreachable helplines. Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta on Friday issued orders to all police stations to provide adequate security to hospitals and healthcare staffers in view of the growing unrest among citizens over the scarcity of medical paraphernalia in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR). Gupta said, “Delegations of various doctors’ bodies met me and informed me about the problems they were facing owing to medical shortfalls, following which I have issued instructions to all police stations to provide adequate security to hospitals and increase the patrolling squads’ visits.” Critical care expert Kapil Borawake said, “The medical shortfalls of all sorts are pushing patients’ relatives to lose tempers. It is the administration’s responsibility to ensure that Covid hospitals have enough medicines and oxygen supply. The authorities need to step up urgent measures to avoid creating law and order situation.” There has been a rising demand for remdesivir, oxygen/ventilator beds in various hospitals after the spike in cases this month. The daily positivity rate in the Pune district is almost 30% with an average of 10,000 new cases every day. The rampant and irrational use of remdesivir and its inadequate supply added to the woes. Besides, the daily requirement of liquid medical oxygen is fast reaching the daily production capacity and hospitals have started feeling the pinch. “These medical shortfalls have started taking a toll on the doctor-patient relationship. There is a sense of distrust among citizens that healthcare workers/hospitals are not doing enough to treat their kin when, in reality, they (healthcare workers) are utterly helpless owing to the severe crunch of medical resources,” said Sanjay Patil, the chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India (HBI). Office-bearers of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Pune branch, on Friday wrote a letter to deputy commissioner of police (Pune city) Ravindra Shisave apprising him of the growing instances of abusive, rude behaviour, intimidation and physical violence the healthcare workers were facing from patients’ relatives. “We request you to extend security to these hospitals to avoid unfortunate incidents of violence. Hospitals’ visit by patrolling squads to Covid hospitals will be helpful,” B L Deshmukh, the president of IMA, Pune branch, stated in the letter to Shisave on Friday. The IMA also requested Shisave to create awareness among the police personnel about the latest amendment in the Epidemic Act, offering special protection to healthcare workers during the Covid pandemic. “We request you to circulate information internally to all police stations to guide them when such violent incidents occur,” Deshmukh said. “We wish to ease out the stress among healthcare workers working tirelessly. This step will help create a fearless atmosphere at workplaces like clinics and hospitals,” Deshmukh said, adding that many IMA members were facing problems in reaching clinics and hospitals in their own vehicles following the recent restrictions enforced by the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/medical-infra-shortfalls-upset-patients-relatives/articleshow/82108506.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Advocate Salim Malik, counsel for Mohd Shoaib and Shahrukh, had sought bail for his clients on the same ground. The special public prosecutor Amit Prasad, informed the court that the role attributed to the applicants and the material relied upon were the same as those relating to other accused. The court also took into consideration a list of all those accused who had been granted bail. It, however, put riders on both the men while granting bail on a personal bond of Rs 20,000 with one surety each. “They shall not tamper with evidence or influence any witness in any manner; they shall maintain peace and harmony in the locality and appear before the court on each date of hearing to attend the proceedings…,” directed the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ne-delhi-riots-2-get-bail-on-ground-of-parity/articleshow/82108508.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Residents’ bodies gear up to pitch for vaccination||Chandigarh: UT adviser Manoj Parida’s appeal to resident welfare associations of the city to engender awareness about the vaccination process seems to have spurred them to set up camps. On Thursday, the adviser said RWAs should help the administration by persuading eligible residents to get themselves vaccinated. While local councillors of Chandigarh and Mohali have been quite active in spreading awareness regarding vaccination and also in organising camps for the purpose, residents welfare bodies have not been proactive. It is hoped that the adviser’s nudge would make them step up their efforts. Hitesh Puri, chairman, Chandigarh Resident Associations Welfare Federation (CRAWFED), said, “Almost 90% of the leaders of Resident Welfare Associations are not young people but senior citizens, who themselves fear coming out of their houses due to the Covid-19 outbreak. We will now talk to health officials and set up camps on weekends at the nearest community centre and CRAWFED will make sure that things are well managed.” Leaders of the various Resident Welfare Associations have appealed to those eligible to come forward for vaccination. Baljinder Singh Bittu of the Federation of Sector Welfare Association, Chandigarh (FOSWAC), said, “Vaccination camps will now be set up and awareness regarding the same will be created. Awareness needs to be increased so that people who were scared come forward. All presidents of RWAs are going for vaccination, which would motivate people too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/residents-bodies-gear-up-to-pitch-for-vaccination/articleshow/82107828.cms||---

He said that the Centre has already announced that CBSE exams for Class X will be cancelled and Class XII will be postponed till June. Based on the Centre’s announcement, many states have also followed suit and either cancelled or postponed their board exams. “Chief minister Pramod Sawant should follow this and implement it in Goa,” NSUI president for North Goa said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-students-wing-asks-govt-to-postpone-boards/articleshow/82109168.cms||---
---||Pune||Dist gets 4,300 vials of drug after 2 days, more on cards||Pune: The district on Friday received 4,300 vials of remdesivir after a gap of two days and FDA officials claimed that a substantial number of newly manufactured vials of the antiviral drug were expected to start arriving within the next two-three days. The fresh stock of remdesivir eased the shortage of the drug in Pune to some extent. The remdesivir batches expected in a couple of days were at the post-production stage at various pharma companies and would address the shortage of the drug in Pune for good, said an FDA official. Currently, the daily requirement of remdesivir in Pune district has gone up to 11,000 to 14,000 vials per day. “The production of a batch of remdesivir vials takes about 72 hours. Post-production, the next 14 days are utilised in ensuring sterility and quality controls,” S B Patil, joint commissioner (drug), FDA, Pune, told TOI. Quite a few pharma firms had slowed down the production of remdesivir in December. “These companies resumed manufacturing in full swing from April 1,” Patil said. — Umesh Isalkar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dist-gets-4300-vials-of-drug-after-2-days-more-on-cards/articleshow/82108522.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Govt revives plans to open jumbo centre for patients||NAGPUR: The state government has revived plans to set up a jumbo centre to treat Covid patients on the lines of Mumbai and Pune. After a review meeting, guardian minister Nitin Raut said an expert team was constituted to identify a suitable place. The team visited probable locations like the Mankapur indoor stadium, Nagpur University’s campus off Amravati Road and its ground at Ravi Nagar, Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) Hospital and Haj House. A report would be submitted soon. On Thursday, Raut had declined to start a 500-bed hospital at the Mankapur indoor stadium, a plan suggested by mayor Dayashankar Tiwari. The minister had told TOI that it wouldn’t be feasible due to lack of health manpower like doctors and nurses. Earlier too efforts were made by the then NMC commissioner Tuakram Mundhe to set up a jumbo Covid centre at Radha Swami Satsang off Katol Road. The NMC had purchased cots and mattresses worth lakhs, but the plan fizzled out. Raut had even said that efforts were under way to collectively add around 1,000 beds at the Government Medical College and Hospital, Indira Gandhi GMCH and AIIMS. “We’re making every possible effort to provide beds to critical patients. Additionally, we’ve granted permission to many nursing homes and other small hospitals to set up Covid beds. We’re also opening up hospitals like Ayurveda Colleges and ESIC for Covid patients,” he said. The minister, however, stated that the only difficulty would be the supply of oxygen for patients for which the administration was in contact with several companies in Visakhapatnam and Bhopal. “We’ve already started receiving oxygen supply from Bhilai and efforts are being made to produce in-house oxygen through the atmosphere. Efforts are also being made to restart a oxygen-producing unit at MIDC Hingna. We’re also directly recruiting MBBS interns to tide over the crisis of qualified manpower required in hospitals.” The minister even rushed a letter to medical education minister Amit Deshmukh seeking state-of-the-art Crisper Feluda machines to expedite RTPCR testing. “The results are available in flat 30 minutes,” he said. According to Raut, the 200 beds proposed for the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in Jamtha would be an added advantage. Structural audit finds NNSR feasible: Collector Collector Ravindra Thakare told TOI that the structural audit report of Nagpur Nagrik Sahakari Rugnalaya (NNSR) was found positive with recommendations to use the ground and first floor. The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court had directed Thakare to check NNSR’s feasibility and submit a report. “I inspected the place. We will take a decision after discussions with all stakeholders,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/govt-revives-plans-to-open-jumbo-centre-for-patients/articleshow/82108518.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Delhi||A fifth of Hindu Rao beds to be for Covid||New Delhi: Preparations have started to convert a section of Hindu Rao Hospital — 210 out of its 980 beds — into a Covid-designated facility, said officials. The mayor of North Delhi Municipal Corporation, Jai Prakash, said the facility, along with Balakram Hospital that will become an isolation ward, will be ready by Sunday. The mayor on Friday visited the Balakram Hospital site where the isolation centre is being set up. “Due to the alarming rate at which Covid cases are rising in Delhi, the municipal bodies have decided to offer all its key facilities to meet the additional demand of beds. It will be called Deen Dayal Covid Care Center, which will have 100 beds at the beginning and a capacity to double the number of beds, if needed,” he added. “I appeal to Delhi government to help us with funds to expand these facilities,” Jai Prakash said. Hindu Rao, the biggest municipal hospital, is mostly visited by patients from economically weaker sections of areas like Burari, Malkaganj, Bara Hindu Rao, Punjabi Basti and the surrounding regions. From next week, non-Covid patients will have to look for alternative arrangements. A senior official said 125 patients who are currently admitted to the hospital would be reloacted in a phased manner. “OPD services and elective services will also be closed down. Around 30 surgeries are currently pending. Besides 200 general beds, 10 ICU beds for Covid patients will also be set up,” the official said. Some of its doctors will be shifted to smaller facilities to handle additional load there, said officials. The hospital had witnessed some controversies during its previous stint as a Covid-designated facility. Between June 27 and October 13, 2020, Hindu Rao had admitted 186 patients, out of which 129 recovered and 28 passed away. It also recorded several patients leaving their treatment midway — categorised as LAMA, leave against medical advice. Its healthcare workers and staff were accommodated in two hotels to minimise the chances of spread of Covid infection. The civic body is yet to clear the Rs 3.7-crore bill incurred due to this arrangement. During the previous phase, 208 doctors, 179 nurses, 67 paramedical staff and 193 ward boys and staffers were deployed in eight batches. In October, doctors had gone on a strike due to non-payment of salaries and 20 Covid patients had to be shifted to other hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-fifth-of-hindu-rao-beds-to-be-for-covid/articleshow/82108536.cms||Paras Singh

A total of 11,045 new positive cases were reported in the state, taking the count of positive cases to 3854563.

Positivity rate is the number of people found positive out of every 100 samples tested, thus out of every 100 who were tested in the state on Friday more than 22 people were found positive. And Friday was the eleventh consecutive day when more than 4000 Covid-19 positive cases were reported in Madhya Pradesh. And Friday was also the fifteenth consecutive day in the state when every day came with a new high in terms of reporting highest number of fresh Covid-19 cases in a single day.

A group of drama and folk artists, attired in the drama costumes, took out a procession from the Ayyappan temple to Trichy collector’s office, drawing the attention of everyone. “We carried out the procession to highlight our plight to the people and the government. The ban on conducting temple festivals is adding to our woes,” said coordinator of Tamil Nadu Drama and Fold Artists welfare association, K VShanmugam. In the memorandum submitted to the Trichy collector S Divyadharshini, the artists explained in detail about their financial constraints caused by the Covid-19 pandemic for the past one year.

We appeal to the government to allow us to hold such programmes for our livelihood,” said artist ‘Kalaimamani’ Mangalam Natarajan of Trichy. “We appeal to the government to provide Rs 10,000 per month for each family until the situation returns to normal,” said an artist S Selvakumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/folk-artists-seek-nod-to-stage-plays/articleshow/82108525.cms||---
---||Delhi||40-year-old held from UP for abducting, raping teen||NEW DELHI: A week after a 16-year-old girl was kidnapped from northeast Delhi’s Bhajanpura, police managed to rescue her from Uttar Pradesh’s Firozabad. The cops have also arrested her 40-year-old neighbour for abducting her and a case of kidnapping, rape and under the POCSO Act has been registered. Police learnt about the kidnapping on April 8, after which a manhunt was launched to find her. During the initial probe, it was found that a neighbour, Shakil, who worked as a contractual labourer, was also missing since the same time. “We found that Shakil is from Firozabad. A team was sent to his native village to track him down, but he was not found at his house. His phone records were then checked and technical surveillance used,” said Sanjay Kumar Sain, deputy commissioner of police (northeast). The officer said that Shakil was frequently changing locations, based on the technical surveillance. “Following several raids, he was found in Firozabad and arrested. The girl was found at the house of a relative of the accused,” the DCP said. “After a medical examination, he was booked for rape, under the POCSO Act and for kidnapping the girl.” Shakil confessed to kidnapping the girl and said he had promised to marry her. “He had first taken her to his house and assaulted her before hiding her at a relative’s place,” a police officer said. The girl was handed over to her family and counselling sessions have been arranged for her, police said.

According to him, 100 beds each could be increased in the GMCH, IGGMCH, 500 in AIIMS and 300 in Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) various hospitals spread across the city. He also informed that he would be helping Kshirsagar’s firm in Wardha to get a license to produce remdesivir injections and it can start production as early as possible. The city MP’s directives came after a meeting with NMC commissioner B Radhakrishnan, mayor Dayashankar Tiwari, MLC Pravin Datke, AIIMS deputy superintendent Dr Manish Shrigiriwar and NGO Maitri Parivar’s Chandu Pendke. The BJP stalwart assured to arrange 5,000 oxygen cylinders and 2,000 ventilators for the city hospitals, which were facing massive shortage of the equipment. He also gave instructions to AIIMS authorities to start 500 beds, including oxygenated and ventilated ones, and NMC would provide the material for it. “We need to work on a war scale to save the patients’ lives, who are dying due to lack of beds and oxygen cylinders. We will provide all help to the administration in this regard to save the precious lives,” he said. The minister also asked the NMC to appeal to private hospitals to increase their beds for the Covid patients. The BJP heavyweight further directed NMC to explore setting up of oxygen producing plants at its hospitals to reduce dependency on others. He said he had spoken to experts in this field and they were ready to help. “As of now, Inox in MIDC is producing 85% oxygen, and the city is getting supply from this company. I had asked them to take their capacity to 100%, but they don’t have required material. So, it would be better of NMC offers its land to anyone who intends to set up an oxygen producing plant in the least possible time,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gadkari-directs-admin-to-increase-1200-beds-for-covid-patients/articleshow/82108540.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Delhi||Most environmental cases in SC against govts, finds thinktank||New Delhi: A research study by an independent thinktank has revealed that a majority of environmental cases filed in the Supreme Court are against the government. The findings by Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy observe that are filed by individuals and the government, followed by private companies and other entities. In the majority of cases, both central and state governments are usually made respondents. The report titled ‘Courting the environment- implementation of environment judgements’ has been carried out in two parts. The first part is a database of environmental judgments from the Supreme Court from 1980-2018.The second part is an in-depth analysis of five landmark judgements between 2019 and 2020. The study says in 60% of the cases, the court relied on external assistance to gather evidence. “Such assistance is especially required in environmental matters, which can be technical and require specialised expertise that judges do not have core competence in. In order to make up for this gap, the court mainly relied on amicus curiae, expert committees, etc,” stated the research. Meanwhile, the thinktank on Friday released a documentary ‘Garbage Matters’ on solid waste management in the national capital. The online premiere of the short film was followed by a discussion on solid waste management. Justice Gita Mittal, former chief justice, Jammu & Kashmir High Court said during the discussion, “The informal sector needs to be integrated with formal sector, sensitised and equipped in better waste segregation methods so their health is not compromised.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/most-environmental-cases-in-sc-against-govts-finds-thinktank/articleshow/82108560.cms||---

The BJP event was completed peacefully and farmers were detained to avoid any confrontation.” Among others who attended the event were Kurukshetra MP Nayab Singh Saini and Haryana chief minister’s political secretary Krishan Kumar Bedi and BJP district president Raj Kumar Saini.Earlier in the day, farmers held a panchayat under the banner of BKU Haryana (Charuni) at Shaheed Udham Singh Memorial Hall on Barara road in Shahabad-Markanda town, to discuss police action in case related to smashing the windshield of Kurukshetra MP’s SUV on April 6 in Shahabad. Police has added Section 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide) of the IPC in the case. After the meeting, they gathered outside the Shahabad-Markanda police station and burnt the effigies of Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and Kurukshetra MP Nayab Singh Saini to protest the “politically motivated police action”. In Shahabad, BKU (Haryana) Charuni state spokesperson Rakesh Kumar Bains said, “Section 307 of the IPC was added to suppress the voice of farmers, following pressure from a politician. The same section could not stand in the court and it has been changed to 308... They had arrested our four union workers but they got bail from the court. We term it as murder of democracy by the police. Therefore, we burnt the effigies and held a protest.” 4 arrested farmers released All four arrested farmers — Gurvinder Singh of Mamu Majra village, Kulwinder of Majra Mohalla, Kehar Singh of Damli village and Hakam Rai Sura of Rattangarh village — were released from Kurukshetra district jail on Friday, following a district court order issued on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/outside-bjp-camp-in-haryana-farmers-protest-against-party-state-chief-dhankar/articleshow/82109177.cms||---

---||Mumbai||As Covid cases spike in Maharashtra jails, HC on its own initiates PIL||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday initiated a suo motu (on its own motion) public interest litigation in a bid to address concerns over “alarming” rise in Covid-19 cases between April and March this year in prisons across Maharashtra, and sought details on all cases inside jails. The HC referred to media reports that almost 200 prisoners across 47 prisons had tested Covid-19 positive as on April 14. The court noted that the number has gone up from 42 to 200 almost within a month, and 86 staff members working in prisons have also got infected. The HC bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and C V Bhadang placed the suo motu PIL for further hearing on April 20. In its order, the HC said, “On the next date, the respondents will place following information on record. The status of the COVID-19 cases, including both the staff members and the inmates in the prisons in the state of Maharashtra; the measures being taken and proposed to be taken to control the spread of the virus in the prisons; and measures to de-congest the jails.” Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, representing the state government, submitted that the HC had taken up a similar cause in July last year, where the measures taken by the state government were noted and certain directions were issued. He added that the current situation will have to be dealt with similarly. In its order, the HC said, “The reports show a sudden rise of COVID-19 cases in the state prisons, indicating a need for the court’s intervention to revisit the measures. This is a fit case where the court should take note of this situation and take up the cause in public interest.” The court issued notices to secretaries of state home department and revenue department, Director General of Police and Director General of Prisons. Earlier this month, while granting emergency parole to a convict in open prison, the Aurangabad bench of the HC had suggested that the state government should transfer prisoners from overcrowded jails to open prisons to take care of cattle and cultivation and other purposes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-as-covid-cases-spike-in-state-jails-hc-on-its-own-initiates-pil/articleshow/82109181.cms||---

---||Delhi||SW district chosen as model for green plans||New Delhi: A report submitted to National Green Tribunal (NGT) on the status of preparation and implementation of the district environment plans (DEP) in the capital said that the South West district has been selected as a model district for DEP. NGT has directed DEP be prepared and implemented across the country. Each of the 11 districts in the city has to develop a DEP for seven thematic areas — waste management, water quality management, ambient air quality, domestic sewage, industrial wastewater, mining activity and noise pollution. For waste management, the plan should be for separate kinds of waste — solid waste, biomedical waste, construction and demolition (C&D) waste, hazardous waste, electronic waste (e-waste) and plastic waste. The committee has directed Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) to provide all the necessary data in respect of various thematic areas, such as noise pollution, ambient air quality, bio-medical waste, industrial pollution, etc. District magistrates have been asked to coordinate with the officer in-charge of the district concerned from DPCC to obtain the requisite data. The report by the monitoring committee said, “The data of South West district collected from urban local bodies has been compiled and sent to Central Pollution Control Board this February. District magistrates of the other areas have been impressed upon to prepare their DEPs.” The committee observed in its report that district magistrates “need more time to collect and collate the extensive data from various stakeholders or agencies as nothing material was done for over a year.” The report pointed out that the requisite steps for developing DEP were not taken as the officials were busy in combating Covid-19 and at present for vaccination drive. “A common concern of the DMs was that collection of data was a hindrance due to non-alignment of boundaries of the urban local bodies with those of the districts. However, they were directed to coordinate with their counterpart in other districts. They were informed that possibility will be explored to club more than one district for the purpose of preparation and implementation of DEP, if so required, and necessary permission will be sought from NGT,” said the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sw-district-chosen-as-model-for-green-plans/articleshow/82108574.cms||---

---||Pune||Educators hint at pitfalls for SSC students in top colleges||Pune: After the central and international education boards’ decisions on standard XII and standard X exams, educators fear that SSC students from the state board will be at a disadvantage during the first-year junior college admissions in top city colleges. The central and international boards have cancelled standard X examinations and are opting for internal assessments. In the admission season, there is a mad rush to get into some colleges in the city and cut-off marks in all three faculties are over 90%. Since the state education minister has maintained that SSC students will compulsorily appear for a board examinations, educators fear that the internal marking system by other boards will favour their students to get better marks and given them an edge over state board students. Rajendra Zunjarrao, principal of Modern College of Arts Science and Commerce, felt the state board also needs to come up with a formula to promote the students. Since hardly any classes were held and not all have access to online education, there are no ways that students can be given marks on anything that happened during the academic year. Hence, the only other option remaining is coming up with a formula where marks are given after taking into account the performance of students in previous three or five classes, Zunjarrao said.“Another option is that wherever online admissions are done, the Centralised Admission Process committees can devise a way to conduct city-wise online entrance exams. This will again bring a level playing field for all students. But, a statewide entrance may not be possible as the numbers are large,” he added.Chandrakant Rawal, former principal of Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce, said the competition is highest in the top 10 colleges in the city, and if the state decides to go ahead with board exams while others go forward with internal assessment, the scales would be tipped in favour of students from other boards. Vasant Kalpande, member of the expert committee set up by the state education ministry for suggesting an action plan on smooth conduct of board examination in the state, said discussions are still on and he would not like to comment on the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/educators-hint-at-pitfalls-for-ssc-students-in-top-colleges/articleshow/82108572.cms||Ardhra Nair

He said lapses in the buildings used for maintaining EVMs have been frequently reported across the state. The EVMs for the assembly constituencies of Dindigul, Athoor, Oddanchathiram, Nilakottai, Palani, Vedasandur and Natham were kept in the strong rooms on the Anna University campus in Reddiarchathiram.But they had noticed that a tree which had fallen on the compound wall on the western side had not been removed for the past one week, which could aid entry of miscreants into the campus unnoticed. Also, this wall had large gaps for allowing storm water to recede from the campus, but the gaps which were 2 feet x 2 feet in size, could easily allow people to enter the campus. Hence, they should be covered with wire mesh and Border Security Force personnel posted on all sides of the campus.The university staff should be allowed to enter only through the eastern entrance and the two entrances on the western side should be sealed, he said. Additional CCTVs and cameras to monitor all sides of the campus have also been sought.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/give-extra-security-for-strong-room-dmk/articleshow/82109191.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Oxygen shortage hits small towns, cities too||BHOPAL: Not only the bigger cities of the state but the small cities and towns too are jolted by the shortage of oxygen amid the surge in Covid-19 cases. Besides places like Bhopal , Indore and Jabalpur, smaller districts are also upping the demand for oxygen. Hospital managements find it difficult to handle the situation and are waiting for the supply to "normalize." Four deaths were reported in Chhatarpur, again because of alleged oxygen shortage. District administration sources in Ashoknagar said that oxygen was available only for Friday when the district hospital had 15 oxygen cylinders. The district administration of neighbouring Guna was sending 25 cylinders. Hospital authorities in Ashoknagar have written a letter to the health department officials of Gwalior for supply of oxygen cylinders. Civil surgeon SS Chari told the local media that, “we have a 200-bed hospital and have 101 oxygen cylinders when we need about 300.” He said that Ashoknagar comes under the jurisdiction of the office of the joint director of the health department of Gwalior and he had written a letter to the office for the supply of cylinders. On Friday, oxygen suppliers, who are now reluctant to speak over the issue, admit, “shortage “. There was hardly any difference in the supply of the life-saving gas. Smaller districts of Bundelkhand continue to face “shortage of oxygen”, officials said. “The government is focused on the supply of oxygen to the government hospitals but a large number of patients are admitted in private hospitals of many cities where the oxygen crisis is deeper”, health department sources said. The government is expecting that the oxygen supply is likely to improve “very soon”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/oxygen-shortage-hits-small-towns-cities-too/articleshow/82108579.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Hunt on for ‘Rizwan’, whose passport was in Sachin Waze’s home||MUMBAI: The National Investigation Team (NIA), probing the cases of planting of explosives in a Scorpio near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25 and the subsequent murder of the vehicle owner Mansukh Hiran on March 4, is looking for ‘Rizwan’ whose passport was recovered from arrested assistant police inspector (API) Sachin Waze’s Thane house last month. On Friday, the NIA court remanded assistant police inspector (API) Riyazuddin Kazi, who worked with Waze at the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU), to judicial custody till April 23. On Kazi’s request, the court asked jail authorities to ensure his protection, but his plea to be allowed to take cash for canteen use was rejected as only money order is allowed in jail. The NIA didn’t press for Kazi’s custody as he is likely to be made an approver. Sources claimed that he has already given statements under Code of Criminal Procedure Section 164 and spilled the beans on Waze and other officers. They said Kazi has been accused of having prior knowledge about Waze planting gelatin sticks in the SUV near Ambani’s residence, and participating in destruction of evidence though he told the NIA that he didn’t know of Hiran’s murder plot.  “As Kazi was working under Waze’s supervision at the CIU and his deposition will have evidential value, he is likely to be made an approver,” said a source. After Waze’s arrest on March 13, the NIA had searched his Thane flat and seized several incriminating documents, including a passport in the name of Rizwan. The NIA is verifying if the passport is a fake or that of a criminal or terror suspect. TOI was the first to report on April 3 that the initial plan hatched in November 2020 was to plant explosives in a stolen vehicle, identify two members of a terrorist organisation and kill them in a fake encounter near Ambani’s house. Sources said a Maruti Eeco was stolen from Aurangabad with this plan in mind. The vehicle is not yet trac-ed, but the number plate was recovered from Mithi river along with Waze’s CPU, laptop, hard drives and DVRs earlier this month. Waze on Friday sought permission to speak to his lawyer over the phone. The court allowed him to speak to his lawyer for 15 minutes once a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hunt-on-for-rizwan-whose-passport-was-in-wazes-home/articleshow/82109202.cms||Ahmed Ali

Shivkumar N, a parent of a standard X student, said, “Once the CBSE board cancelled their exams, we were positive that CISCE too would either postpone or cancel. There is some confusion about how the board will find a fair way to ensure equivalency in marks of students who opt for exams and those who don't. Each parent can decide for their own ward.” A standard X ICSE student, who did not wish to be named, said she had been preparing for the board exams and she would appear for the it along with the ISC students. “Schools will take all precautions during the pandemic and adhere to safety norms. I have really prepared for the exam and I would like to see how I fare in board exams,” the student said. Another parent said options should not be given as it will be unfair to students. “CISCE should revise their decision and either cancel or postpone the exam,” she said. Principal of Vidya Pratishthan's Magarpatta City Public School, Pune, Chandrika Banerjee, said, “Our students have been attending the online classes since March 2020 and were eager to face the ICSE exam in 2021. Our students prefer to appear for the offline examination.” Rupai Dikholkar, a teacher at Blue Ridge Public School, said, "The whole year the ICSE students have been through so much of stress. They were struggling with online studies along with no clarity about their exams. Students should opt for no exams and focus on their future plans.

The letter suggested that as the economy has begun to turn around from the impact of the earlier lockdowns, the state should avoid imposing another lockdown, even a partial one. “Resorting to such a drastic measure at this stage may not be conducive to the overall situation and will push the economy into a downward spiral,” he wrote to the CM. Shankar suggested focusing on measures like ramping up Covid testing and organising awareness drives about adhering to Covid protocols such as wearing masks, maintaining physical distancing and personal hygiene. He also urged the government to levy penalties for violations of Covid protocols.

The judges observed for the above reasons, the GO in so far as a ban on festivals and religious congregations cannot be interfered with.The court made the observations while dismissing the public interest litigation filed by G D Manikandan, an advocate and a resident of Sivaganga district.The petitioner stated that the Chithirai festival of Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple is one of the important festivals celebrated in Madurai. He stated that the temple authorities had released a schedule for the 15-day festival which commenced with the flag-hoisting ceremony on April 15.Due to the increase in Covid-19 cases, the state government had passed a GO extending the lockdown with restrictions. As per the GO all the festivals and religious congregations shall remain prohibited.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Cremations begin along Saraswati riverbank in Siddhpur||AHMEDABAD: The mounting death toll of Covid-19 patients has left pyres and cremation furnaces incessantly burning across crematoriums in Gujarat. The situation is no different at the Saraswati Muktidham at Siddhpur, known as one of the biggest crematoriums in the state. With barely two furnaces out of 14 rendered operational at the Saraswati Muktidham in Siddhpur, cremations have now begun along the Saraswati river in Siddhpur. This is perhaps for the first time that so many simultaneous cremations are taking place along the river bank. J D Patel, trustee, Saraswati Muktidham Trust, said, “We have a total of 14 furnaces at the crematorium, of which five are under maintenance. Due to cremations taking place constantly, seven furnaces got burnt and are inoperative for the time being, leaving only two running.” “Against some 20 cremations taking place in a day on normal days, due to the rise in death toll of Covid-patients, at least 50 cremations are taking place at the crematorium on a daily basis. It is impossible to do so with two furnaces and therefore, we’ve limited it for deceased Covid patients,” said Patel. Cremation of the dead due to factors other than Covid is presently taking place along the Saraswati riverbank in the conventional way on a wood pyre. Bodies of the deceased are being brought from Mehsana, Patan and Banaskantha districts to Siddhpur for cremation. “Two days ago i.e. on Wednesday, some 68 cremations took place at the crematorium. Of these, 29 were of Covid-patients,” said Patel. At present, people at the crematorium have to wait for at least six hours for their turn to perform the cremation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cremations-begin-along-saraswati-riverbank/articleshow/82108590.cms||Bharat Yagnik

---||Dehradun||Vaishnavite akhadas threaten to cut ties with Niranjani, Anand counterparts on Kumbh exit call||HARIDWAR: After two Shaivite akhadas, Niranjani and Anand, decided to exit the Haridwar Maha Kumbh, the three Vaishnavite akhadas (also known as ‘Bairagi’), Nirvani, Digamber and Nirmohi, threatened to end relations with these two akhadas. The akhadas had decided to make an early exit after a seer, Kapil Dev Das, mahamandaleshwar of Nirvani akhada, died on Thursday following Covid-19 complications. Meanwhile, the apex body of all 13 akhadas, Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad (ABAP), consulted with all the orders of sadhus but failed to arrive at a consensus. The head of ABAP, Narendra Giri, is currently admitted at AIIMS-Rishikesh after he tested positive for the coronavirus. According to sources, talks will resume once Giri is back from hospital. Akhadas under the ABAP include seven Shaivite, three Vaishnavite, two Udasin and one other akhada, Nirmal. The Shaivite or ‘sanyasi’ akhadas consider the third shahi snan, which took place on April 14, as the high point of the Kumbh. Since it has concluded, the mela is all but over for them. For the Bairagis, however, the upcoming Ram Navami festival (on April 21) is an important day and they are incensed that other akhadas are making announcements calling off the mela without taking this into account. Mahant Rajendra Das, a Bairagi saint, told TOI, “Who has given the right to call off the Kumbh mela to the Niranjani and Anand akhadas? All three Bairagi akhadas will take the holy dip on April 27 and stay at the mela premises till April 30. If the seers of other akhadas do not apologise for their statement, Bairagis will cut all ties with them.” Meanwhile, Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati, the 97-year-old shankaracharya of Dwaraka Sharada Peetham, also said that the Kumbh should run its full course. The shankaracharya’s representative Swami Avimukteshwaranand said, “The Kumbh starts and ends based on astrological calculations of planetary alignments. The camp of Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati will run for the entire Kumbh period. However, we will avoid big events to prevent the virus from spreading.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/vaishnavite-akhadas-threaten-to-cut-ties-with-niranjani-anand-counterparts-on-kumbh-exit-call/articleshow/82107060.cms||MS Nawaz

The summit push commenced on Thursday midnight after a spell of snowfall at the Camp-4. “Mountaineers faced the gushing winds throughout the climb till dawn. The route opening team fixed the rope till the summit around noon. After the route opening team’s summit, the Giripremi team followed them and reached the summit after a determined climb,” the statement said. Umesh Zirpe, the leader of the expedition, said, “Due to the shortage of rope just 800 metre below the summit, the route opening team had to stop their climb midway and return to Camp-4 on Thursday. Chhang Dawa Sherpa and I, who were operating from the base camp, arranged the necessary equipment from Kathmandu to Camp 4. This ensured the second attempt to the summit of the route opening on Friday went successfully.” Mt.

Considering the increasing number of cases, district collector S Divayadharshini held meetings on Thursday with deputy director of public health Dr S Ramganesh to discuss stepping up facilities. The district administration says that the positivity rate rose to 5.1 with fresh cases going above 200. The number went up to 241 cases on Thursday and 273 on Friday. The meeting decided to set up CCC at Nehru memorial college at Puthanampatti and Kurinji engineering college at Manapparai to keep them on standby to utilize them if the need arose following a sudden spike and the full occupancy at MGMGH which has 450 beds for Covid-19 treatment. DDHS Dr S Ramganesh visited SRM medical college hospital at Irungalur to check the feasibility of creating isolation ward. A senior public health department official said that the movement of people in peri-urban areas like Thiruverumbur and Mannachanallur to the city area has been increasing the cases in those areas. On Friday alone, the public health department lifted 5,423 samples from contacts, travellers, in-patients, SARI and ILI cases.

It is the second highest in the country after Maharashtra where 419 fresh fatalities were recorded on Saturday. The number of new cases recorded in the last 24 hours in Delhi was 24,375, nearly 10% of all cases reported in the country on Saturday. According to the bulletin issued by the health department, the positivity rate of Covid-19 in the city has now crossed 24% meaning one in every four people being tested for the infection is turning positive. “Things are turning worse with each passing day. If you think the statistics are bad, just visit the emergency wing of any hospital. The sight of family members grieving over the death of their loved one, those struggling to find an ICU bed for their parents or children who are gasping for air has become all too common,” said a senior doctor at one of the top private hospitals. She added that unlike the previous waves, this time many young people were dying due to the disease. Delhi had reported 104 deaths on Wednesday, 112 on Thursday and 141 on Friday. Many of these lives could be saved with timely medical intervention, said another senior doctor. “My aunt is admitted in a private hospital in South Delhi. She needs anti-viral drugs but the hospital has given us in writing that the same is not available,” one of the family members said. Many small hospitals are also reporting a shortage of oxygen cylinders. Delhi, which was reporting less than a 1,000 cases till March second week, has witnessed an explosion of new cases over the past month and currently, the active cases stand at 69,799. Of them, 46% are under home isolation and 25% are in hospitals while the rest are recuperating in Covid Health Centres and Covid Care Centres.

The bins, which will prevent overflow of garbage and clandestine burning of the waste will be placed in a few localities and in 33 micro compost centres (MCC).These bins will have around 40% of the structure buried under the ground and provides more space for the waste. They are made of galvanised steel and have pedal-operated lids to prevent the overflow of garbage. Corporation has utilised Rs 14 crore and has planned to install the bins in 175 locations. The prototype was inspected by the engineering department officials and faculty from NIT Trichy. “Experts verified the quality and specification of the model bin to suggest their inputs to improve the efficiency. The prototype was good. Our staff will also inspect the mechanism of such bins installed in Bengaluru and Visakhapatnam,” corporation commissioner, S Sivasubramanian told TOI.While residents have sought the bins to be placed in all residential streets and markets, the commissioner said that they will be placed only in MCCs. Srirangam and Central bus stand localities may also get a few bins. While the conventional bins can accommodate only 2.5 cubic metres of waste, the modern bins can store 4 cubic metres waste. The bins cannot be lifted like the usual bins and require crane-mounted waste collection vehicle to empty them. The corporation has placed orders for such vehicles. Officials said that they will place the bins in a phased manner across the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/experts-check-prototype-of-new-garbage-bin-for-trichy/articleshow/82108595.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Chandigarh||Over 57% of registered street vendors defaulting on dues: MC||Deepak.Yadav@timesgroup.com Chandigarh: Over 57% of registered street vendors of the city have turned out to be defaulters. The Chandigarh Municipal Corporation has given them time till April 28 to pay their monthly vending fee as well as penalty. Although the civic body authority does not have exact data, sources confirmed that 25% to 30% of registered street vendors have returned to their native places, especially UP and Bihar, due to surge in Covid-19 cases in the city and apprehensions of economic slowdown. According to MC records, out of the 10,888 registered street vendors in all categories, 6,291 are defaulters. Under the non-essential category, there are 6,238 registered street vendors, of which 3,911 are defaulters, while out of 3,510 street vendors in essential service provider category, 1,728 did not pay vending fee to the MC. Moreover, out of 1,140 mobile vendors, 652 turned out to be defaulters. “There may be multiple reasons for street vendors failing to pay their monthly vending fee to the civic body authority. The authority has decided to give them reasonable time to pay their fee. Though economic reasons are also there, but in many cases, street vendors are not paying their vending fee regularly, which looks deliberate and their penalties have also increased manifold due to their consistently lax attitude,” sources said. As many new street vendors have been registered in the past few months, submitting regular vending fee is crucial for them so that they get a vending site in the new phase of draw of lots, which the MC is planning. “Since we have registered a significant number of new street vendors also based on their record and vending period, they will only be given the new vending site in the city if they are found paying the vending fee on regular basis without delay or miss,” an official said. Box: Monthly fee range Monthly vending fee is different for vendors across the city depending on their work but it varies from Rs 300 per month to Rs 2,000 per month. There are 46 earmarked vending zones throughout the city, out of which Sector 15-based vending site is the biggest vending zone with over 800 vending sites. Besides, other street vending zones are given in different areas of the city as per the convenience of vendors and available sites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/over-57-of-registered-street-vendors-defaulting-on-dues-mc/articleshow/82107894.cms||Deepak Yadav

Instead of disposing of the oil in drains, restaurants now sell it to the startup that collects it at the doorstep. Called kB Energy Corporation and projecting the tagline ‘trash to cash’, the firm has tied up with around 40 hotels in Trichy city. It collects used oil at the rate of Rs 25 per litre in 20 litre cans it provides to the hotels. “We will transport the used oil to biodiesel producing companies in Chennai and Bengaluru recognised by the Biodiesel Association of India for a price. The used oil will be recycled and used as fuel in diesel generators,” Kishore Kumar Baskaran, founder of the startup, said. Before this, hotels have been mostly dumping the cooking oil in drains, causing them to clog frequently and cause pollution. A few street vendors have also been purchasing used cooking oil such as sesame oil and sunflower oil from the hotels illegally and reusing it. “We were dumping the oil in drains, now we are getting about Rs 250 a week from selling it to the startup,” P Sathish Kumar, manager of a restaurant in Thillai Nagar said. Employing two youths, the startup uses an electric scooter to collect the oil from restaurants. They can collect 2 tonnes of oil a day and store it in their modest godown in Thiruvanaikoil. “We are presently collecting 1,000 litres from the city restaurants every month. We are approaching a few more eateries to utilise our service which will ensure food and environmental safety,” Kishore added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-startup-helps-recycle-cooking-oil/articleshow/82108598.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Bhopal||Cops share their stresses from the frontlines||Bhopal: The police force battling Covid on the frontline is working day in and day out to contain the virus spread in the state capital. As corona continues to creep into newer areas, cops are worried about their safety and the safety of their family members. In the second wave, around 150 police personnel have tested Covid positive and are undergoing treatment. Over 90% of the Bhopal police force has received both does of Covid vaccine. Despite that, many cops — specially in Ratibad and Bag Sewania area — have tested positive for the virus. The restrictions this year are much lighter as compared to last year, which means police have to manage more people and ensure that Covid protocols are being followed in public places. A senior cop told TOI that his family is very worried about his safety and they have asked him to take an off, but he cannot in the circumstances. He has isolated himself in a room in his house, but unlike last year, this year there has been no provision for police personnel to stay at hotels or lodges. Despite a lot of cops testing Corona positive, the patrolling vehicles are not frequently sanitised and police have to take care of themselves to avoid risk of infection. SHO Ratibad Sudhesh Tiwari said, 15 cops posted at Ratibad have tested positive since April 6. Some family members have also tested positive. He said that police try to avoid direct interaction with public as it poses risk for both the cops and the people. Cops too understand that these are difficult times and do not want to impose fine on violators. They announce and try to counsel people to stay at their homes but still some people could be seen violating the curfew order and cops have to take strict action against them, he said. SHO Bag Sewania Sanjeev Chouksey said, the biggest challenge is that now the number of Covid-19 patients is much more than last year’s lockdown due to which a large number of their family members and relatives go out to arrange for their treatment. Offices are working with 25 percent workforce and the factories are allowed to operate due to which there is a lot of traffic on city roads. Police have to struggle to enforce this partial curfew. He said that around half a dozen cops at Bag Sewania police station tested Corona positive since April 1 and an SI Kunjilal Sen died of Covid-19. The cops are stressed but still discharging their duties with full dedication. He said, police officials have been directed to follow all Covid-19 protocols for their own safety.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/cops-share-their-stresses-from-the-frontlines/articleshow/82108599.cms||Sudeept Mishra

The underpass will help villagers in the vicinity who are prone to accidents due to speeding vehicles while crossing the road.NHAI officials said that the construction work for the project proposed at an outlay of Rs 21 crore, was initiated only a few days ago and will be completed in an year’s time. It was a long-pending demand from people of villages such as Kambur and Karungalakudi in Madurai district and various villages in Sivaganga district, who frequent the road. Elected representatives from Madurai also lent their support for the project by raising the issue at various levels, said an official from the NHAI.“People can cross the road to access the villages on both sides. Highway users need not reduce the speed and have a hassle-free movement. Service roads are available on both sides of the road. They will be enhanced upon completion of the underpass project,” a NHAI official said.A police official from Madurai said that vehicles travelling on the highways can also feel safer as there would not be any crossing once the project is completed. “Police and NHAI tried everything from introducing blinking lights, barricades to bring down the speed to bring down the accidents. The project will be the permanent solution,” he said.At least 12 deaths were reported in a year on an average in the junction before 2018. Most of the accidents took place either in the night or early morning due to poor illumination. The number of deaths came down gradually after the district police and NHAI introduced various safety measures. “We sensitized people to be more careful while crossing the road. We also urged people to carry a torch light to indicate their presence to the drivers of the speeding vehicles. But not many people followed it. We are trying hard to bring down road deaths throughout the district. The project will help us a lot,” the police officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/nhai-initiates-underpass-work-at-karungalakudi/articleshow/82109196.cms||V Devanathan

---||Madurai||Street vendors among low income groups refusing to take jab||Madurai: At a time when special camps are seeing more people coming forward to get vaccinated against Covid-19, many people in the low income groups are not very keen on taking the jab. Lack of awareness and pressures of earning their livelihood are some reasons they cite for their reluctance.Street vendors are among those who come into contact with hundreds of people every day and hence are very susceptible to the dreaded disease. However, they seem to be blissfully unaware of the lurking danger. K Sekhar, 55, a flower vendor at Maatuthavani flower market, said he had incurred a debt of Rs 80,000 during the last lockdown. Now he was working all days a week to repay it. “I cannot afford to skip work even for a day and go to a camp for taking the injection,” says he.G Mohan, the elected president of Madurai Corporation street vendors committee, said City Health Officer P Kumaragurubaran had held a meeting with some of their representatives to conduct a special vaccination camp, but they were not able to convince the vendors on the importance of taking the shot. ``I too haven’t taken the vaccination, I am waiting to do so with some of my members,’’ he said. More awareness sessions are needed for these people, he opined.K Selvam, a member of the committee, said he had tried to convince some of his members even on Friday. ``They asked me if I could give them the assurance, that something like what happened to actor Vivek would not happen to them,” he said.Madurai’s streets have many elderly women vending a variety of goods, like P Pandiammal, 67, who sells vests on Nethaji road, and P Kasammal, 70, who sells vegetables at Sellur. Both of them say they have never fallen sick and don’t remember having taken an injection. Coordinator of Madurai flower market associations, S Ramachandran, said he was in talks with the secretary of the marketing committee for conducting a camp in the market, where there are hundreds of vendors. Most of them are very reluctant to take the injection, he said.Madurai corporation commissioner S Visakan said they were in the process of covering the street vendors also, as they were targeting a population of 5,000 daily, in the eligible category for vaccination. ``We will create the required awareness and cover them also,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/street-vendors-among-low-income-groups-refusing-to-take-jab/articleshow/82109194.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Nagarjuna Sagar bypoll today, result after two weeks||HYDERABAD: Over 2.20 lakh voters will decide the fate of TRS candidate Nomula Bhagat, Congress veteran K Jana Reddy and 39 others in Nagarjuna Sagar which goes to polls on Saturday. Polling will be held from 7 am to 7 pm with the last one hour dedicated for Covid-19 patients to exercise their franchise. EVMs are being used in the bypoll. Counting of votes will be taken up on May 2. The bypoll is going to be a litmus test for the ruling TRS, Congress and BJP as it has potential to set the tone for the 2023 assembly elections. Though the contest is mainly between debutant Bhagat, son of late Nomula Narsimhaiah, and seven-time MLA Jana Reddy, a resurgent BJP is keen to give a tough fight. Among the contestants include three women. The byelection has been necessitated following the death of Narsimhaiah of the TRS, which is seeking to retain the seat. While Bhagat, a Yadav, hails from the BC community which has a sizeable 80,000 voters in the constituency, BJP candidate P Ravi Kumar Naik belongs to the Scheduled Tribe community having nearly 40,000 voters. Though Jana Reddy, who was defeated in 2018 polls, tried to invoke Telangana sentiment, sympathy factor and development done by him as a seven-time legislator and minister, TRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao and ministers tried to neutralise his claims by asserting that several parts of the constituency are still not getting irrigation water despite having Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir. Not stopping at that, KCR even promised the voters what real development would actually mean if they elect the TRS candidate to victory. KCR addressed two public meetings at Halia, promising to complete 13 lift irrigation schemes within one-and-a-half years. He was primarily trying to send a clear message to the people that there is no alternative to the ruling TRS in Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sagar-bypoll-today-result-after-two-wks/articleshow/82108613.cms||Roushan Ali

The pro-CPI Tamil Nadu Farmers’ Association president N V Kannan said all varieties of fertilizers such as di-ammonium phosphate, urea, potash and complex have turned dearer. “Rather than helping farmers double their income as promised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Union government is only doubling their woes,” he alleged. The lockdown apart, increasing prices of diesel and other agricultural input costs has sounded the deathknell for agriculture. However, agriculture department officials claimed they have required volume of fertilizers and farmers can purchase them at existing prices at PACCS and private agencies. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/farmers-slam-rise-in-prices-of-fertilizer/articleshow/82108614.cms||---

Despite reminding the concerned revenue officials and even the district collector, nobody disbursed the same till today,” he added. “Though we approached the bank officials to inquire about the cash assistance, they were not ready to provide proper reply,” said AM Sasikumar, 39, a native of Manappudaiyur in Thanjavur district, who gets a cash assistance of Rs 1000 as he is a differently-abled person. “I have three daughters and a son, while my wife is an agriculture labourer. With the help of the cash assistance we are managing our family. Usually the amount would be credited before the fifth of every month. Bank officials are not ready to give proper answer to our queries,” he added. Another beneficiary V Elangovan, from Kumbakonam, said that none of the old-age pensioners have got the money due for April. “Not only the old age pensioners, even differently-abled beneficiaries known by me are still waiting for money,” he added.

---||Chennai||Can’t inherit reputation: Madras HC to Jayalalithaa's niece||CHENNAI: Can privacy and reputation of a celebrity be inherited by his/her legal heirs like movable or immovable property? No, the Madras high court has said. Privacy or reputation earned by a person during his or her lifetime extinguishes with death. After the death of a person, the reputation earned cannot be inherited like a movable or immovable property by his or her legal heirs, a division bench of Justice R Subbiah and Justice Sathikumar Sukumara Kurup said on Friday. The judges made the observations while dismissing an appeal by J Deepa, niece of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa, seeking to stop the release of a biopic, 'Thalaivi', apparently based on the life of the former CM. The judges noted that the movie is yet to be released and prior to that Deepa is not entitled to seek for an injunction on the ground that her aunt had been depicted badly and thereby her image and reputation is attempted to be brought down. “The release of the movie is subject to the certification to be given by the CBFC. The CBFC will have an opportunity to go through the contents of the movie,” the bench said. “The right of freedom of speech and expression is not conditioned/restricted on the premise that a film maker must only portray one particular version of facts.” If Deepa is aggrieved by the portrayal of the former chief minister or her family members in the web series, the only remedy now open is to seek appropriate legal remedy for damages, the court said and dismissed her petition. Deepa had earlier filed a similar petition and after it got junked by a single Judge, appealed before a division bench and also sought a restraining order on the makers of web series, ‘Queen’ Deepa had said in her petition that the makers of the film had planned to produce and release films on the life story of Jayalalitha as a bilingual film for their commercial and monetary benefits, without the consent of her, a family member and also referred to a web series already out on Jayalalithaa's life. "The life story of Jayalalitha cannot be filmed without adding the life of the her relatives as part of the film. In such an event, the same would amount to invading into our privacy," Deepa's petition stated and contended that her part in the life story, may also be depicted by the filmmakers in their own version, which may affect the family privacy. In response, the makers contended that they did research for years and studied various interviews of Jayalalithaa and read books on her available in public domain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cant-inherit-reputation-hc-to-jaya-heir/articleshow/82107081.cms||Srikkanth D

A few posters of BJP Lok Sabha member from Bhopal, Pragya Singh Thakur, claiming her to be missing during the pandemic have surfaced at the party's state head office, on Friday. The posters going viral in social media were claimed by NSUI Medical Wing, a student unit of state Congress. The BJP has condemned the act and termed it as inhuman. The posters claiming that Pragya Thakur has gone missing amid the worsening coronavirus situation emerged in several parts of the state capital. "Corona mahamari mein Bhopal ki vyavastha ho gai dhwast, janata ne jinko chuna hai sansad vo apni masti mein mast. Laapata sansad ko khoj ke laney wale ko uchit inam diya jayega, NSUI Medical Wing. (Bhopal's system collapsed in Corona pandemic. The people who have chosen her as MP, is having fun. Those who will search and bring the missing MP will be rewarded appropriately)," read the posters by Congress' student wing. The state Congress has neither accepted not denied of having put up the said posters at the state BJP head office. The party has also not released any official statement on the matter. Similar posters on `Thakur gone missing' also surfaced in May last year when the state was hit by the pandemic. BJP alleged that Congress is leaving no chance to take political benefit of a situation like this, which is shameful. "This is Congress' inhuman face who is not even sparing an ailing leader. Sadhvi Pragya is in Mumbai undergoing treatment for the tortures she had been subjected to during the Congress government there. But, Congress leaders have stooped too low to take advantage of this grave situation," alleged BJP state spokesperson, Rajneesh Agrawal. Pragya Thakur has been ill since last one year. Recently she had developed complications and was airlifted to a Mumbai hospital. She had also thanked chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan for providing support during her illness. Sources said the BJP state head office has been closed for ten days after a spike in Covid-19 cases. So far, more than six party leaders have workers in the office have been tested positive. The posters were pasted by anonymous persons on the front wall of the office as the gates were closed on Friday, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/posters-claiming-pragya-missing-surface-at-bjp-office/articleshow/82108615.cms||---

The accused posed as courier boys and tried to gain entry into the doctor’s flat by flashing a knife at his wife, but a neighbour rushed on hearing her screams and managed to disarm the attackers. Shop owner, Vikram Yadav, 33, has told the police he plotted the robbery to clear Rs20 lakh debts he had incurred during the lockdown. He said his son was also removed from school for not paying fees.  Yadav has a medical shop in the vicinity of Jogeshwari (west) where Dr Rajesh Kumar’s clinic is located. “Yadav planned the robbery along with interior designer Ajay Yadav, 32 and collegian Rajesh Yadav,18, to clear his debts. The duo posed as courier boys, while Yadav waited in the building premises,” said ACP Sujata Patil.  The doctor’s wife, Sushila Yadav, was alone in their 6th floor flat at Satellite Park building at 1.30 pm when the incident occurred. “A youth arrived saying he was a courier delivery boy. I spoke to him without opening the safety door and said I not ordered anything. He said my husband had ordered the item. As the box was too big I was forced to open the door. One of the accused immediately barged in and pointed a knife at me. Another person too stepped in with a bag.” Sushila put up a fight and started screaming for help. “On hearing her screams, Nagesh Burla, who lives in the adjacent flat, rushed to her aid. Burla along with other residents chased the duo, but they managed to escape. They found the medical shop owner suspiciously waiting in the premises. They caught hold of him and called the police,” said Jogeshwari police inspector Mahendra Nerlekar. The victim, a teacher, suffered a minor injury on her hand in the scuffle with the two accused. Yadav confessed during interrogation he had plotted the crime as he was in dire need of money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/med-shop-owner-tries-to-rob-doc-to-clear-rs-20l-debt-held-in-mumbai/articleshow/82109211.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

Ranchi MP will now deliver food, medicines at your doorstep||Ranchi: Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth on Friday announced that he will provide food and medicine to Covid -19 patients living in isolation. Seth said the service will be extended to such patients who are living alone as well as those whose whole family has been infected. Seth also made public three WhatsApp numbers for the same. Talking to TOI, Seth said: “The health machinery has completely failed in dealing with the challenge posed by the second wave of the pandemic. I have been writing letters to chief minister Hemant Soren, urging the government to take the necessary steps. But after I saw that people are dying in front of hospitals, I decided to provide assistance to people in distress.” “There are many bachelors, elderly people and students in the state capital who are getting infected and are helpless as they have no one else at home. So I have decided to provide them food at their door steps,” Seth said. “Those testing positive can send their Covid-19 reports to WhatsApp numbers 9431352397, 6203009003 and 9835718119 and place a request for food to be delivered at their doorstep. The patients also need to provide their full address, so that the required items can be provided at the earliest,” Seth said. In a veiled attack at Soren, Seth said that he has been urging the state government to utilize resources that are available with the railways and the various public sector undertakings. “I wrote a letter to the CM on April 7 and had suggested him to use the isolation coaches of the railways and to expand isolation centre at Khelgaon with the help of the CCL. But nothing has been done on that front yet,” Seth said. Meanwhile, state BJP President Deepak Prakash also expressed his concern over the increasing number of cases in the state.

---||Ranchi||FJCCI allows businesses to go for ‘self-imposed lockdown’||Ranchi: The Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FJCCI) has allowed its affiliated associations to keep their respective businesses shut for a few days to contain the virus spread. FJCCI and its affiliated organisations recently held a meeting to discuss measures to break the transmission chain where it was decided that businesses can go for a “self-imposed mini-lockdown”. FJCCI president Pravin Jain Chhabra said, “During the meeting, we gave a free hand to the associations representing different sectors of the economy for imposing restrictions for a few days and some of them are even considering going for it. Even small efforts to break the virus chain are welcome.” Perhaps taking note of the trade body’s suggestion, a sweet shop owner on Friday pasted a notice on his shop in Argora stating that his establishment will remain shut for 20 days in view of the spike in cases. Similarly, one Chandra Prakash, who owns an optical shop at Hazaribag Road in Ranchi, closed his establishment on Friday for an indefinite period. He said, “Given the rise in cases and the fact that there are no beds available in hospitals, it’s better to down shutters as that will reduce the risk of me and the customers contracting the disease.” Meanwhile, Chhabra said that the trade body has undertaken several measures, like initiating a ‘no-mask no entry’ campaign in market places, to contain the spread. “We have also started distributing masks and food packets in some areas,” he added. The trade body, along with the Marwari Sahayak Samiti (MSS), has also started distributing oxygen cylinders to patients. The initiative has been taken by MSS and the FJCCI members are making monetary contributions to it after it came to the fore recently that oxygen cylinders are unavailable. FJCCI has expressed its dissatisfaction over the shortage of beds and ventilators in hospitals, saying that the government’s priority should be to ensure basic infrastructural facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/fjcci-allows-businesses-to-go-for-self-imposed-lockdown/articleshow/82108088.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Thousands of Maha passengers break through barricades at Hatia station to avoid Cov test||Ranchi: Unruly scenes unfolded at the Hatia railway station on Friday evening as passengers arriving from Mumbai on-board the Lokmanya Tilak – Hatia Special Express broke through barricades to evade Covid tests upon arrival. District officials and RPF personnel of Ranchi railway division remained silent spectators as the overwhelming crowd of passengers violated all safety protocols upon arrival. As many as 1,700 passengers had hopped off the train upon its arrival at Hatia station around 3:15 pm. “There were ample number of RPF personnel to ensure crowd management and social distancing norms. As per protocol, each passenger had to be put through testing by the health teams deployed by the administration at the station. But after a while, the passengers turned unruly and broke through barricades,” a senior divisional official said on condition of anonymity. The district administration had deputed two circle officers to ensure implementation of Covid-control measures and testing of all incoming passengers. When contacted, they did not respond. Two hours later, another special express train arrived at Hatia station from Surat in Gujarat carrying 1,700 passengers and even then, the passengers were not tested. With another special train due to arrive from Panvel at Hatia station in the early hours of Saturday, senior officials in the district expressed their inability to depute health teams to screen passengers at the station. “Despite the rise in Covid-19 cases, passengers arriving in express trains which are arriving early in the morning at Ranchi and Hatia stations are not being screened for Covid-19 as health teams usually arrive after 9am,” another railway official said. On Thursday, chief minister Hemant Soren had expressed concerns over the rising Covid-19 cases in the state and the arrival of thousands of migrant labourers in special trains from states with a high caseload. As many as 120 railway officials in Ranchi division have tested positive in the last fortnight and four have succumbed to the virus. On Friday, the station master of Lohardaga and a loco pilot died of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/thousands-of-maha-passengers-break-through-barricades-at-hatia-station-to-avoid-cov-test/articleshow/82107988.cms||Dhritiman Ray

With this, the total number of Covid beds in Dhanbad has gone up to 1,300, including 850 in different government-run hospitals and organizations. As per government guidelines, private hospitals like Dwarkadas Jalan hospital, Asharfi hospital, Yashlok hospital, Pragati Nursing home and Jims hospital have earmarked 50% of their beds for Covid patients. When contacted, Dr Raj Kumar, who is the district in-charge of Integrated Disease Surveillance Project cell, said that while all the ICU beds in state-run and private hospitals are full, there are nearly 200 general beds available for virus patients. Meanwhile, Singh has directed all the BDOs and the medical officers to physically verify the number of beds and other infrastructural facilities available at private hospitals and collect data on the total number of beds available in these hospitals and on the beds earmarked for Covid patients. Besides this, the district fire officer has been asked to conduct a fire audit of all the private hospitals to assess whether firefighting equipment are installed there and train the workforce in handling the fire equipment in case of an emergency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/42-bed-dhanbad-rly-div-hosp-to-function-as-covid-centre/articleshow/82108015.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Former E S’bhum civil surgeon dies of Cov; laxity in treatment: Kin||Jamshedpur: Former East Singhbhum civil surgeon Dr Dharamnath Singh died of Covid-19 at the age of 74 barely within two hours after being admitted to Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College and Hospital (MGMMCH) on Thursday night. His family members alleged Singh, who tested positive for the virus on April 12 and was in home isolation since, was not given proper treatment which led to his death. Singh was admitted to MGMMCH after he complained of breathlessness. Reacting to the allegation, nodal officer at MGMMCH Dr M P Chaudhury on Friday said, “Singh’s oxygen level was 67 when he was brought in and we tried our best to save him. He was immediately shifted from the emergency ward to the Covid ward, but his family members should have shifted him to a hospital much earlier. Being a doctor himself, he should have acted more responsibly and not waited for the eleventh hour.” MGMMCH superintendent Dr Sanjay Kumar said, “Dr Singh was provided oxygen but as the patient was admitted in a very critical condition, nothing much could be done before he passed away. All treatment protocols for Covid patients were followed for Singh.” Kumar added, “Those in home isolation should be constantly monitored and family members must remain in constant touch of doctors.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/former-e-sbhum-civil-surgeon-dies-of-cov-laxity-in-treatment-kin/articleshow/82108072.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
