Long queues outside hospitals is a common sight in many cities and the demand for oxygen and hospital beds is evergrowing. Besides healthcare workers and other COVID warriors, who are working round the clock to save lives, many ordinary citizens as well as celebs have also stepped up to offer help to those in need in this hour of crisis. From helping with medical supplies and arranging ambulances or hospital beds to organising COVID tests at home, these good Samaritans are leaving no stone unturned to put humanity first. CT spoke to a few Kolkatans from different walks of life who are coming to the rescue of COVID-hit families and individuals with their selfless acts of kindness. ‘If we don’t step up to help each other now, when will we?’Our entire health system is falling apart and if we don’t step up to help each other now, when will we? It’s good to see that so many people are coming forward to help others in these difficult times. We are trying to help as many people as possible by organising hospital beds and getting ambulances. Recently, a COVID positive patient had a cerebral attack at midnight. Thankfully, the nurses and doctors in our group managed to arrange for an ICU bed for him. There are many families with aged couples where both the partners have tested positive and they have no one to look after them. We are trying to transfer them to safe homes where they can get proper care and timely meals from our organisation. Our nurses and doctors regularly monitor their health. – Madhabilata Mitra (picture above), model and assistant secretary of Covid Care Network‘I am there for all Garfa residents’ My club, Sapui Para Sabuj Sangha, is trying to extend all the possible help to all the affected people in Garfa area. In the second wave, many families are seeing all the members, including children, turning positive at the same time. They have no one to carry out the household chores or run errands. Apart from delivering ration and medicines to them, we also try to arrange for ambulance, oxygen, blood and emergency helplines. Since Aadhaar and doctor’s prescription are necessary for medical help now, we are connecting people to important contacts for these services instead of providing doorstep delivery. – Pota, singer‘Building a sustainable healthcare system with youngsters, doctors’I, along with my team of medical and non-medical volunteers, have geared up to offer medical assistance to the people affected by COVID. The team is trying to create safe homes with the support of doctors, nurses and health workers. We’re getting oxygen concentrators, gathering non-medical volunteers, organising crowd fundings, creating a crisis response team of medical volunteers and ensuring availability of medicines at MRP to curb black marketing. We feel this is the need of the hour for our country and state. We are trying to build a sustainable healthcare system with youngsters and doctors so as to help as many people as we can. – Kamaleswar Mukhopadhyay, director‘We maintain a list of updated helpline numbers that work’With the help of my best friend and a few of our mutual friends, I am working round the clock to save people hit by the pandemic as the country goes through its biggest medical crisis. From admitting patients to hospitals to arranging oxygen, plasma, blood, medicines etc – we are just a call away for any such help. Nowadays, social media is filled with posts about helpline numbers for oxygen and medicine supplies. But most of these contacts are not really useful. Either they don’t pick up the phone or have run out of stock. So, we maintain an Excel sheet with all the updated numbers that can actually help people in the time of an emergency. We call on these numbers every two-three hours and update our list.  – Anustup Roy,IT professional‘Helping each other is the only way to tackle this outbreak’In this hour of crisis, it is heartening to see so many ordinary citizens coming forward to work day and night for saving lives. There are many critical non-COVID patients who are not getting hospital beds. We are helping them get one. Besides, ICU set-up at home is being arranged with the guidance of a professional nurse and doctor. Helping each other in every big and small way is the only way to tackle this outbreak.  – Saibal Trivedi, who runs an NGO||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkatans-put-humanity-first-step-forward-to-help-residents-affected-by-second-wave/articleshow/82292688.cms||Debolina Sen
---||Bengaluru||Canada’s Lululemon Athletica opens tech centre in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: Canadian athletic apparel company Lululemon Athletica has established a tech hub in Bengaluru, its first outside of North America. The idea is to step up its digital offerings and omnichannel experience. Lululemon Athletica is the second prominent Canadian apparel brand to come to India for tech. Hudson’s Bay Company, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue, set up a centre in Bengaluru a few years ago. Lululemon is expected to hire about 250 technologists for the centre by 2022. Its CTO Julie Averill said India provides a compelling talent proposition. “All of our strategies are underpinned by technology – product innovation, omnichannel guest experiences or international market. We believe that India allows an opportunity for a very long term strategic investment and to find top talent that will be a part of a different kind of brand. India will provide us with capabilities and access to talent that we don’t have today,” she told TOI in an exclusive interaction. A number of global retailers, most prominently Walmart, Target, Tesco and Lowe's, have centres in India that are helping digitise operations and building technology platforms to provide insights and improve customer experience. This has become imperative given the pace at which online players like Amazon have grown. Founded by Chip Wilson in Vancouver in Canada in 1998, Lululemon is a yoga-inspired, technical athletic apparel company. It started as a design studio by day and yoga studio by night and soon became a standalone store in 2000 in Vancouver. It clocked an 11% increase in net revenue to $4.4 billion in 2020 over the previous year. Last year, it acquired home fitness startup Mirror for $500 million. Calvin McDonald, CEO of Lululemon Athletica said, “The opening of our India technology hub will help further our strategic growth plan with technology, enabling both our people and our guest experience as we expand to serve new guests across the globe.” The Bengaluru centre will work in areas like data science, machine learning, and full-stack cloud engineering to support merchandise planning, product and location information management. "We want to set up a data science lab In India that serves the rest of the world. The core of Lululemon is product innovation, merchandising, forecasting, and data science is embedded in all. We are one of the few vertical retailers—we own everything from fabric and design to supply chain. We have a very unique proposition called the science of feel – how is the feel of your fabric. We are innovating at every level of our integrated business and that’s why we are coming to India,” said Vaidyanathan Seshan, vice president of international technology and head of India Technology Hub. Lalit Ahuja, CEO of ANSR, a consulting firm that has helped set up tech centres in India for a number of global brands, including Lululemon, said retailers are turning to India’s tech talent to support digital transformation, provide enhanced omnichannel experience, AI and cognitive competencies. "Cloud and analytics are the key imperatives,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/canadas-lululemon-opens-tech-centre-in-bengaluru/articleshow/82298525.cms||Shilpa Phadnis
---||Bengaluru||Covid surge casts shadow over Karnataka’s agri activities||BENGALURU: After a bumper yield last year, farmers in Karnataka fear the raging Covid crisis may seriously impact agriculture and allied activities in the new season, though they are exempted from the current lockdown. Despite the outbreak of the pandemic last year, the state recorded an all-time high of 153 lakh metric tonnes of food output. But this time, the pandemic is fast spreading from cities to rural areas, which have a higher share of the elderly and at-risk farmers, and this could put a strain on local healthcare systems and farming activities. A senior agriculture official said they are worried that if the current situation stretches, it will have an adverse impact on summer harvest and preparations for the kharif season, especially if infections start spreading among members of the farming community. “Still the situation is not that bad. We are hoping it will ease soon, but if the second wave prolongs beyond May, it could cause huge damage,” the official added. Kurubur Shanthakumar, president of Karnataka State Sugarcane Growers’ Association, alleged police in districts have not been allowing farmers to move to their fields, instead, have been seizing their implements when they question them. “How will farmers harvest their crop or go to mandis to sell it if they are not allowed to move around? This is a big question before every farmer now. We had been urging the government to issue green ID cards, considering the experience we had during last year’s lockdown, but the request has fallen on deaf ears,” he added. “The government must intervene to save farmers from the current crisis as there is a 60-70 per cent decline in supply of fruits and vegetables,” claimed Shanthakumar. The lockdown is also leading to possible labour crisis as hundreds of migrant workers have returned to their hometowns, leaving behind a big void. Growers of commercial crops like coffee, arecanut and pepper largely rely on migrants. “We are going to face a shortage of labour next month. This is also because the government has restricted movement of people due to Covid-19. The state government has not made any attempt to retain them by setting up special camps,” said Vinith Gowda of Chikkamagaluru planters’ association. He asked the government to find some way to ensure farmers do not face any problem in harvesting and procurement of crops. Agriculture minister BC Patil said there should be no restrictions on agriculture and allied activities. “It has come to my notice that some officials have seized agricultural implements. This should not happen. Farmers must be allowed to transport agricultural or horticultural produce to markets, travel to fertiliser shops or Raita Samparka Kendras and take up agricultural activities without any hindrance,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/covid-surge-casts-shadow-over-states-agri-activities/articleshow/82298530.cms||---
---||World||Single Pfizer pill cure for Covid-19 at home could become available||LONDON: The first human trials of a single pill cure for Covid-19 are underway which, if successful, would mean Covid-19 could be treated by patients at home without needing to be hospitalised. Phase 1 trials of a pill developed by Pfizer are taking place in the US and Belgium among approximately 60 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 60. The antiviral drug, classed as a protease inhibitor, has been tested on animals without any significant safety risks. "This Phase 1 trial is being conducted in the US. The oral antiviral clinical candidate PF-07321332, a SARS-CoV2-3CL protease inhibitor, has demonstrated potent in vitro anti-viral activity against SARS-CoV-2, as well as activity against other coronaviruses, suggesting potential for use in the treatment of Covid-19 as well as potential use to address future coronavirus threats," Pfizer said in a statement. "This is the first orally administered coronavirus-specific protease inhibitor to be evaluated in clinical studies." Protease inhibitors bind to a viral enzyme (called a protease), preventing the virus from replicating in the cell. Protease inhibitors have been effective at treating other viral pathogens such as HIV and the Hepatitis C virus, both alone and in combination with other antivirals. The Phase I trial is a randomised, double-blind, sponsor-open, placebo-controlled, single- and multiple-dose escalation study in healthy adults evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the drug. If successful, phase 2 and 3 trials among a larger number of people will take place. Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer chief scientific officer and president (worldwide research, development and medical), said: "We have designed PF-07321332 as a potential oral therapy that could be prescribed at the first sign of infection, without requiring that patients are hospitalised or in critical care." "Given the programme is still in research and development, we cannot speculate on any potential, timeline or outcome," a Pfizer spokesperson said. Pfizer is also investigating an intravenously administered investigational protease inhibitor, PF-07304814, currently in a Phase 1-b multi-dose trial among hospitalised clinical trial participants with Covid-19. Albert Bourla, CEO and chairman of Pfizer, told CNBC this week: "In India it is a horrible situation. In a pandemic you are only as protected as your neighbour. If we cannot provide solutions for India and Africa they will become the pool where the virus will replicate and generate variants."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/single-pfizer-pill-cure-for-covid-19-at-home-could-become-available/articleshow/82298506.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||Bengaluru||Netizens offer to help non-Kannada speakers bridge language barrier in pandemic times||BENGALURU: Language barriers are tough to navigate, even during a crisis like a pandemic. But Twitterati are rising to the occasion, offering to bridge the communication gap between non-Kannada speaking Bengalureans and local officials, including hospital staff. Sindhu Rao, a techie, tweeted on Tuesday: “If anyone needs help in speaking to authorities in Kannada, I can help. No one should suffer because of not knowing a language.” Her tweet received an overwhelming response with more than 450 shares and over 900 likes. Several Bengalureans replied with ‘count me in’ messages and appreciated the gesture. Giri, another Twitter user, responded: “New to the city and the language. Was having a tough time enquiring about basic things as well. Thank you for doing this, will be surely helpful to many.” Even those well-versed in other languages came forward to help. Shiv Kumar tweeted: “If anyone needs help for Kannada and Konkani! Please let us know.” Shivangi Shankar posted: “Yes! Also, if you are a non-Hindi speaker and need help in a Hindi speaking state I can help with that.” Sindhu, 29, said she has always helped people around her in translating bits of Kannada at other times, but realised the gravity of the situation when a colleague was infected with Covid and couldn’t comprehend BBMP directives. Nor could officials understand his side of the story in English or Hindi. Sindhu, born and brought up in south Bengaluru, realised there was a language gap only after moving to Mahadevapura after her marriage and being closer to her workplace. “I saw a different culture in this part of the city with many non-Kannada speakers. In south Bengaluru, every person we met spoke to one another in Kannada, be it shopkeepers or anyone else,” she said. She said sometimes people are caught between two extremes — those pushing others to learn Kannada and those crying foul about Kannada imposition — and they need help the most. “In normal times, I have had people recording Kannada conversations with domestic helps and officials and sending them to me seeking a translation,” she said. However, currently such a communication gap can cost a patient the golden hour, she added. “In these times, both sides are overwhelmed, upset, worried or angry. The language issue adds to it,” she explained. Apart from appreciation tweets, Sindhu received a screengrab of a Kannada channel’s news update from a person. “It had details about what’s allowed and what’s not during the lockdown. And I was happy to help,” she said. “People can send me direct messages, recordings or get me on a call with the person concerned,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/netizens-offer-to-help-non-kannada-speakers-bridge-language-barrier-in-pandemic-times/articleshow/82298564.cms||Farheen Hussain

---||Bengaluru||Four college girls create website for Covid assistance||Bengaluru: Four II-year BA students of Christ (deemed-to-be university) have created a website of accumulated Covid-19 resources for different cities in the country, including Bengaluru, Pune, Delhi, Ahmedabad and Mumbai.  The four girls aged around 20 — Ashwini Katte Raghavendra, N Sindhu, Renibi Mukhia and Geethika Nair — regularly update the information on their website and verify the sources mentioned. The website primarily includes a list of verified contacts, sites and organisations to access hospital beds, Covid medication, plasma donors, oxygen cylinders and meal delivery systems across various states in India. Ashwini told TOI that the idea took off when she and Sindhu saw a spike in requests for plasma and other essentials, while working as part of Christ’s Centre for Social Action (CSA). As members of the committee, they saw the situation first-hand. “We also witnessed some cases in and around our extended families and initially planned to create a Google document with all the information,” she said. But on realising that Google docs are prone to crashes, Sindhu found a platform to create websites free of cost and that finally led to https://sindhu200121.wixsite.com/website-1 Soon, Renibi and Geethika joined their initiative and their website was approved by the university a week ago. Since then, the students have been receiving more than five to six calls a day. They have even made some contacts with BBMP officials after connecting with them regularly. “We ask for details of patients and the requirement and help them accordingly,” said Ashwini. In between studiesBut how do they manage this initiative alongside studies? “We try to have a schedule around it. We are asked if our phone numbers serve as helplines, but we say we are not a 24/7 facility, just some students trying to do our bit,” said Ashwini, adding that sometime in the afternoon or evening, the four take up website updating and verification work as per each member’s schedule.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/four-college-girls-create-website-for-covid-assistance/articleshow/82298581.cms||Farheen Hussain
---||Goa||Stimac has faith in me, I am preparing myself: Seriton||Panaji: FC Goa right-back Seriton Fernandes is ready for his international debut whenever India are next in action. The defender has put up consistent performances in the Indian Super League for the last four seasons, making 78 appearances. Seriton has not slowed down. Infact, he has played an influential role as Goa made their debut in the AFC Champions League and picked up three draws from the five games. His performances have surely impressed national coach Igor Stimac. Seriton was unlucky when he was first called for the national camp last year as the coronavirus pandemic played spoilsport The Goa defender was called again last month for the tour to UAE, but since he was recovering from an injury, he was allowed more time to recover. “He (Stimac) told me he will call me for the next camp, so I am very happy. He has faith in me, so I am just preparing myself for the next game,” Seriton said on Wednesday, ahead of the club’s final ACL game against Al Wahda. The 28-year-old will captain the team with all four foreigners deciding to leave the country fearing travel bans amid rising cases of Covid-19 in India. Seriton, who believes he is the best right-back in the country, is confident Goa will put up a good show in the concluding league clash. “Yes. I always think like that because you must believe in yourself. So, I always think of myself as the best right-back in India. I also proved myself in Asian Champions League and don’t want to talk much as I can show much more on the pitch,” said Seriton. Goa’s goalless draws against Al Rayyan and Al Wahda in the first two games took many by surprise. Since then, Juan Ferrando’s team has grown in confidence. Goa did put up a fight against last years runnersup Persepolis before suffering a 1-2 and 0-4 defeat in consecutive matches. However, they picked themselves up in the last game against Al Rayyan, conceding a last-minute equaliser. “In the Champions League very good teams are there and it is very difficult to play. There are very good players. So, we have to focus on the next match and prepare to win. I will give my best and I am confident,” said Seriton.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/stimac-has-faith-in-me-i-am-preparing-myself-seriton/articleshow/82298614.cms||FLAVIO LOPES
---||Mumbai||Dabbawalas: We have always stood by Mumbai and we will do what we can in such times||They are famously known to deliver tiffins across the length and breadth of Mumbai with skill and clockwork precision. The much-loved dabbawalas’ perfectly connected network has been ferrying meals to offices and homes across the city for years. Last year, when the pandemic struck they had to suspend their services, which left them struggling for a livelihood. The services resumed only recently, where they have been delivering food to a few offices, smaller shops and hospitals. However, city-goers now envisage the dabbawala playing a bigger role in the current scenario, where there is a dire need for medicines, equipment, food etc. “Why can’t this ready network of tiffin carriers help to ferry vital supplies?” ask people on social media. One user tweeted: “Mumbai dabbawala system could help in oxygen sourcing & delivery system. It is almost similar, pick up a filled cylinder from one place, take it to the place of requirement, take empty ones back to the refilling station.” Another added: “Our beloved Mumbai dabbawalas are losing their livelihood again. Kindly use their expertise in providing essential services to the needy. No one can beat them while moving from place to place in trains and bicycles. Think about it.” We cannot use trains or buses as we don’t come under emergency seva: DabbawalasWhile these seem like ideas that can be explored in Mumbai in the current scenario, Bombay Times spoke to dabbawalas for their point of view to understand how feasible this proposal could be. Subhash Talekar, president, Mumbai Dabbawala Association, says, “We are ready to carry small, portable equipment, medicines and other items to those in need. We have always stood by Mumbai and we will do what we can in such times. In fact, I just received a call asking if our dabbawalas could take food to a COVID centre. I asked my dabbawalas and they said, ‘Why not! We will wear a PPE suit and do that’.” He adds, “If there is a need for help, some dabbawalas are ready to do their bit, but suvidha bhi milni chahiye. After all, a dabbawala can’t go on a cycle from Goregaon to Churchgate. We cannot use trains or buses as we don’t come under emergency seva, so it’s all on cycles.  Aur cycle pe aadmi kitna daudega? We want to request the government to let us use the trains, so we can help.” The dabbawalas’ tiffins have reduced in number due to the pandemicWhat’s on their watch now: Giving food to hospitals, kirana stores, watchmenThe dabbawala network has shrunk in number, but their operations are on as they cater to a few establishments that are open. Kailash Mahadev Shinde, who transports tiffins on the Tardeo-Peddar Road route, says, “By God’s grace, we are working again, though the dabba delivery is less in comparison to what it was before the pandemic. I used to have 10 people under me handling the delivery of 170 dabbas. I would deliver 30 dabbas myself, but now I am managing it alone with just eight to 10 dabbas in all, some of which I deliver to shops and kirana stores by 10.30am and some to security guards. I also deliver some dabbas to staff at JJ Hospital, Nair Hospital and Breach Candy Hospital, who come to the gate and take the tiffin inside. We had such a bad time in 2020 that we are barely managing.” Dashrath Kedari, who used to operate on the Dadar-Borivali route, adds, “We can definitely help in these times as this is our work. While many of us are berozgaar, some dabbawalas managed to get other jobs as watchmen, some have taken up haathgadi jobs. So, if we are called to deliver anything, we will. We are all praying for better times, so we can bounce back like before.” Dabbawalas busy at work prior to the 2020 lockdown (pic credit: Prathamesh Bandekar)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/dabbawalas-we-have-always-stood-by-mumbai-and-we-will-do-what-we-can-in-such-times/articleshow/82298061.cms||Ismat Tahseen

---||India||Covid-19: With 3.8 lakh new infections, active cases cross 30 lakh||NEW DELHI: The alarming rise in daily Covid-19 cases and deaths in India continued on Wednesday even as the number of active cases crossed 3 million for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic. In the past 24 hours, 3.79 lakh fresh cases and 3,596 deaths were recorded in the country, highest in a single day. International comparisons show that the US has 6.8 million active cases which is the world’s highest. With over 3 million such cases, India has the second highest number, followed by Brazil, where over a million Covid patients are deemed active. France too has nearly a million active cases while the count is half a million for Turkey. Since the start of the second wave, Maharashtra is reporting the country’s highest cases and Wednesday’s case count of 63,309 was no exception. Uttar Pradesh reported 29,824 cases while the count was 25,986 for the national capital. Maharashtra continues to lead the country in deaths. On Wednesday the state reported 985 fatalities, its highest so far. It is also alarming to note the rate at which active cases are increasing in the country. On February 16 there were 1.38 lakh active patients – the lowest for this year. It took 40 days for these cases to increase from that level to cross 5 lakh. The next milestone of 10 lakh was covered in just 12 days and since then the increase has been unprecedented. India added the next 10 lakh active cases in 10 days and another 10 lakh in just nine days. On Wednesday, 14 states and UTs recorded their highest single-day case count on Wednesday. These included Karnataka and Kerala which reported 39,047 and 35,103 cases, respectively. Similarly, Bengal’s 17,207, Tamil Nadu’s 16,665, Rajasthan’s 16,613, Andhra Pradesh’s 14,669, Bihar’s 13,374 and Haryana’s 12,444 cases were the highest ever in these states. Apart from these, Odisha (8,386), Jharkhand (8,075), Uttarakhand (6,054), Goa (3,101), Himachal Pradesh (2,539) and Puducherry (1,258) also reported their highest case counts on Wednesday. Delhi was the country’s second-worst region with 368 deaths, followed by Uttar Pradesh where Covid killed 266 people. Karnataka reported over 229 deaths linked to Covid. Six more states reported over a hundred deaths — Gujarat, Jharkhand, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/with-3-8-lakh-new-infections-active-cases-cross-30-lakh/articleshow/82301108.cms||Atul Thakur
---||India||SII cuts vaccine price for states to Rs 300/dose, terms it a ‘philanthropic gesture’||Facing a public outcry over pricing of Covishield, Serum Institute of India on Wednesday announced a 25% or Rs 100 reduction in its price for state governments, describing it as a “philanthropic gesture”. The bad news is that at Rs 300 a shot, it will still be twice what the Centre is paying, For private hospitals, the price has been left unchanged at Rs 600 a shot. The vaccine is also unlikely to be easily available in private market until September-October. A Serum Institute official had earlier told TOI: “Owing to the complexity and urgency of the situation, it is challenging to supply it independently to each corporate entity.” Criticism from state governments and civil society, however, seems to have forced Serum Institute to reduce prices. A news agency report had also said that the Centre has taken up the issue with Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech as both companies had raised prices. “As a philanthropic gesture on behalf of @SerumInstIndia, I hereby reduce the price to the states from Rs 400 to Rs 300 per dose, effective immediately; this will save thousands of crores of state funds going forward. This will enable more vaccinations and save countless lives,” the company CEO Adar Poonawalla said on Wednesday, four days after defending his company’s pricing policy. He, however, did not comment on his company’s efforts to link Centre’s procurement price with that for states. The Centre’s procurement price was around Rs 150 per jab for the initial orders placed in January and March. Covishield price in India is higher than other countries such as South Africa and Sri Lanka (around Rs 390 per dose each), European Union $2.15 (around Rs 160) and UN initiative, Covax $3 (around Rs 225). With infection rising at a rapid pace, there is greater demand for vaccines and calls for the government to step up the drive. But manufacturers are unable to step up production.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sii-cuts-vaccine-price-for-states-to-rs-300/dose-terms-it-a-philanthropic-gesture/articleshow/82301152.cms||Rupali Mukherjee
---||Visakhapatnam||Health Dept Has Ordered Over 4 Cr Doses But Delivery Date Yet To Be Communicated||Visakhapatnam: The third phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive for people aged 18 and above is to be rolled out on May 1. But the ‘liberalised’ vaccination drive for the young cohort is likely to be delayed in Andhra Pradesh due to the ongoing uncertainty over the arrival of ordered stocks. The AP health department has identified 2.04 crore people aged between 18 and 45, and placed an order for purchase of 4.08 crore doses from the two existing vaccine manufacturers in the country. But even as of today, the exact date of delivery has not been communicated to the health department. Even though the already registered private vaccine facilities can directly procure the vaccines, they are waiting for clarity on the pricing and supply system. Speaking to TOI, a senior state official informed that the vaccine manufacturers have committed orders at least till the end of May. “There is still no indication of supply of stocks to Andhra Pradesh. It may take time to enter agreements with these vaccine companies for procurement of vials for the third phase vaccination drive. Even though the Union government allowed inoculations for the young people from May 1, it may not be practically possible in Andhra Pradesh in the given situation. We would plan for the third phase depending on the availability of future stocks,” said the official. Based on the recent Union government’s decision, Andhra Pradesh rolled out the vaccination drive for all citizens aged 45 and above from April 1 But due to limited supplies from the Union government, the state is already facing the vaccine shortage every now and then to inoculate the existing priority groups (health care workers, frontline workers and persons aged above 45 years). In fact, the state had to stop the drive for several days in between for want of vials. The state has so far received about 62.84 lakh vaccine doses, both Covishield and Covaxin combined, from the Union government. The state is likely to get another three lakh doses on Wednesday night. Vaccine hesitancy was widely reported among the health care workers and frontline staff in the initial days of the rollout of the vaccination process. The sporadic adverse events and the alleged deaths had also fuelled the fears over the vaccine. But according to health officials, the count of people approaching vaccine session sites to get immunised has seen a five-fold increase in recent weeks as there is a growing awareness about the need to get vaccinated compared to the initial days. This apart, the sudden spike in the daily case load is invariably driving people to get vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/health-dept-has-ordered-over-4-cr-doses-but-delivery-date-yet-to-be-communicated/articleshow/82297523.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Visakhapatnam||Call of duty: Defence docs get ready to serve||Visakhapatnam: Following the Prime Minister’s appeal to ex-servicemen of the medical wing to extend services amid the pandemic, AP Sainik Welfare has started bracing itself. AP Sainik Welfare extended its services last year as well. According to sources, over 500 former defence personnel in medical services are working at different hospitals across the state. There are estimated to be around 8,000 ex-servicemen in the state, around 5,000 of whom are in the 40–50 age group. “Every ex-serviceman is ready to serve the country in any form. Around 700–1,000 ex-servicemen worked in the army medical core. We will get 200–300 former jawans based on trade and experience. We can use jawans who worked in operation theatres or as nursing assistants,” said Sri Balaji, an ex-serviceman dentist from Guntur. Sources inform that there are around 30 ex-servicemen of the army medical core in Guntur. “Most ex-jawans are elderly. The recently-retired and short service commission servicemen will be useful in this situation,” said Satyanandam, AP Sainik Welfare in-charge for Visakhapatnam. Satyanandam further said a majority of ex-servicemen from the army medical core are settled in Hyderabad, bifurcated AP will get 200–300 people only. In AP, the highest number of ex-servicemen live in Visakhapatnam, 16,000. This is followed by 15,000 in Guntur, 12,000 each in Prakasam and Chittoor and 7,000 in Srikakulam. Speaking to TOI, assistant director of AP Sainik Welfare VV Raja Rao said they would extend services if the state requires and asks through district collectors. “Our director, V Venkata Reddy, has asked district welfare wings to send names of people who worked in the medical wing. We will prepare lists and be ready for the call,” Rao added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/call-of-duty-defence-docs-get-ready-to-serve/articleshow/82297634.cms||Siva G

The FIR was registered after a complaint was lodged by regional vigilance enforcement officer Ashok Vardhan, whose team conducted a surprise inspection of Prakasam super-specialty hospital and found that there were 476 Remdesivir injections against the sanctioned stock of 533. Suspecting irregularities in the use of the 57 missing injections, the vigilance and enforcement team informed Prakasam SP Siddarth Kaushal, who directed Ongole I town police to investigate the case. “Diversion of such emergency medicines would be viewed seriously. Some miscreants are trying to exploit the situation and selling these life-saving medicines in black at exorbitant prices,” he said.

The temple officials put up barricades to ensure that all devotees adhered to Covid-19-appropriate behaviour. The goddess is considered to be the reigning deity of Waltair. According to temple authorities, the festival used to draw at least one lakh people in a single day every year. “But due to the second wave of Covid-19, the turnout is very low in number thsi year. All Covid-19 guidelines are being followed at the temple,” said a temple representative. Special prayers were offered to the goddess during the festival.

The rating agency has said that bank credit growth will also get hit because of the restrictions and risk-aversion by them, resulting in bank loans growing 7.3-8.3%. “For Q1FY2022, we had earlier expected a GDP expansion of 27.5%, boosted by the low base. With the surging cases and evolving restrictions, the pace of GDP growth in the ongoing quarter may be tempered to 20-25%,” said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA. While the 20-25% forecast appears to be a high rate of growth, this is entirely on account of the low base because most economic activities slowed to a crawl in the first quarter of FY20. ICRA cautioned that the localised restrictions have started to impede the sequential momentum in certain sectors, such as domestic airlines’ passenger traffic, electricity demand, vehicle registrations and the generation of GST e-way bills, even though the year-on-year growth will be high in April 2021 because of the low base related to the lockdown in April 2020. “We estimate the impact of the second wave of the pandemic on many sectors to be lower than the first — an advantage from the less widespread and stringent lockdowns as of now (vis-a-vis the prolonged nationwide lockdown last year). Other supportive factors include lower global disruptions, absence of pricing pressures on commodity producers, increased digitisation and availability of additional funding lines,” said ICRA president (ratings) Ramnath Krishnan. Nayar added that there was an upside risk to inflation because of supply disruptions during the Covid lockdown, which eliminates the likelihood of a rate cut. However, the RBI was likely to retain its accommodative stance as it has made it clear that this approach is linked to growth impulses improving. According to group head (financial sector ratings) Karthik Srinivasan, credit growth could take a hit as lenders turn cautious and sacrifice growth over asset quality construction. He said that the pandemic and the continuing restrictions will put pressure on asset quality for lenders and result in profit normalisation for banks stretching beyond 2022. Srinivasan said that while the clamour for a moratorium on loan repayment and reintroduction of restructuring could arise as the severity of the lockdown was increasing, it was difficult to second guess the RBI. ICRA expects Indian GDP to grow by 10-10.5% in FY22 as against 10.5-11% expected earlier. The key downside risks to its forecasts are a continuation of the new wave of infections, an extension of the restrictions and severe restrictions being imposed in additional states and the existing vaccines not being effective enough against the new variants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/icra-cuts-growth-forecast-to-10-10-5-from-10-11-earlier/articleshow/82299027.cms||Mayur Shetty

The judge, who brushed aside the court registry’s objections over the locus standi of a third party in filing such pleas, posted the case to May 7 for hearing. The judge also directed the CBI to file its counter by that time. Raju, who was elected to the Lok Sabha on a YSRC ticket, contended in his plea that scores of accused in the quid pro quo case were given official positions in the YSRC government in AP and witnesses in the case are directly working under these accused functionaries. Jagan’s associates in the governance of AP are also his co-accused in the CBI case, he said, citing all these issues as reasons for seeking cancellation of bail given to the CM. The instances of Rajya Sabha members V Vijaya Sai Reddy and Ayodhya Rami Reddy, MLA Dharmana Prasad Rao, IAS officers Aditya Nath Das and Y Srilakshmi were cited in the plea. The case will come up for hearing on May 7. The YSRCP MP in his plea made serious allegations against Jagan and Vijay Sai Reddy saying that they are unleashing a reign of terror in the state by suppressing the voice of dissent. He linked this to the quid pro quo case and described this as an attempt to suppress the witnesses in the case against them. They can now, directly and indirectly, influence the witnesses, he said. Though Emaar scam was not part of the quid pro quo case, Raju made mention about that too in this case and found fault with the decision of YSRCP leadership in giving MP ticket to Koneru Rajendra Prasad, a key accused in the scam, in Lok Sabha elections of 2014. The MP also said that both Jagan and Vijay Sai have been seeking exemption from physical appearances before the trial court for non-serious reasons and described this as an attempt to dodge the trial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cbi-court-notice-to-jagan-in-bail-cancellation-case/articleshow/82299080.cms||---

One of the two wagons also overturned but no casualty was reported. According to reports, the derailment disturbed the track alignment on Kanpur-Kasganj rail section and train traffic on the route came to a halt. The mishap took place on Wednesday afternoon near Kakwan road crossing near Bilhaur railway station. Senior railway officials rushed to the spot to take note of the incident. The technical staff was deployed for repairing the track. Cranes were pressed into service to remove the derailed wagons. Bilhaur railway station superintendent Ram Sajeevan said, “The repairing work to restore the route is underway.” “On Wednesday afternoon, a 45-coach goods train was heading towards Farrukhabad from Kanpur, when the guard cabin and two empty wagons adjoining it derailed with a loud noise close to Kakwan Road crossing at the eastern end of Bilhaur railway station. One of the two wagons of the goods train overturned and the parts including its wheels were broken and strewed along the track. As soon as the guard alerted the pilot, the driver stopped the goods train. The movement of the trains was stopped as soon as the accident occurred. The work to restore the route was underway on a war footing note,” he added. A senior railway official, meanwhile said, a probe would be conducted to know the cause of mishap.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/goods-train-derails-in-kanpur-rail-traffic-disrupted/articleshow/82299508.cms||---

Chavan said Gujarat got 9,623 N95 masks per 1,000 Covid-19 patients, Maharashtra only 1,560, UP 3,916, more than twice of Maharashtra. Gujarat received 4,951 PPE kits, UP got 2,446 and Maharashtra 223 per 1,000. Gujarat got 13 ventilators, UP seven, and Maharashtra two per 1,000.

He urged people not to panic as the government is readying 37,000 more beds to treat Covid-19 patients. Nani held a review meeting on Wednesday to take stock of the Covid-19 situation in the state.  “The call centre (104) would be strengthened and facilities at Covid care centres would be upgraded. We are fully utilising 423 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen allocated by the Centre to save critical patients. There is no shortage of oxygen anywhere in the state,” he said. He added that only 260 MT of oxygen was consumed at the peak of first Covid-19 wave last year. “Consumption has almost doubled in the last few days due to increasing number of hospitalisations,” the minister said. Principal secretary (health) Anil Kumar Singhal said district collectors have been directed to ensure better facilities at Covid care centres so that people do not insist on hospitalisation. “Admission of only critical patients in hospitals would help save lives. We have revived even small oxygen plants in the districts to meet local demand. About 25 MT of industrial oxygen has been diverted for medical oxygen needs and we are also getting another 20 MT from the revived plants,” he said. He further said about 33,000 beds would be set up in about 60 Covid care centres soon. “There is no shortage of Remdisivir injections in the state. We have supplied over 30,000 vials to private hospitals and 25,000 vials to government hospitals. Private hospitals have been directed to route their indents through the drugs inspector,” Singhal added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/37k-more-beds-for-covid-patients-soon-nani/articleshow/82297569.cms||Samdani MN

Joining the growing list of contributors in India’s fight against the second wave of Covid are Facebook, IBM, Hero MotoCorp, Vedanta, Paytm, SpiceJet, Intel, Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai. Facebook promised $10 million to emergency rescue efforts. “I’m thinking of everyone in India and hoping we get this virus under control soon. Facebook is working with Unicef to help people understand when they should go to the hospital and giving $10 million to emergency response efforts,” said Facebook CEO Marc Zuckerberg in a post. Coronavirus: Live updatesSalesforce pledged $1 million for medical equipment, creating vaccine awareness and community isolation centres. IBM too announced funds for oxygen concentrators — medical devices that concentrate oxygen from ambient air — and emergency hospital beds, and Intel said it will be delivering technology and resources to support critical medical needs. Vedanta pledged Rs 150 crore to create 1,000 hospital beds across 10 cities equipped with oxygen support. Paytm placed an order for importing 3,000 oxygen concentrators from the Rs 10 crore it raised. Maruti Suzuki said on Wednesday that it will stop manufacturing cars in its Haryana plants between May 1 and 9 to make oxygen available for medical purposes. Hero MotoCorp contributed oxygen cylinders to hospitals. Additionally, it will provide PPE kits and motorcycles & scooters to health workers in several states, including Delhi-NCR, Gujarat and Rajasthan. Hyundai pledged Rs 20 crore for setting up oxygen-generating plants in hospitals and installing medicare facilities in most affected Covid states. It will also extend support to hospitals in manpower and operational cost for three consecutive months and will augment its mobile medical units and telemedicine clinics in rural areas to break the chain of spread, Hyundai said. Reliance Foundation will set up a 1,000-bed Covid care facility with oxygen supply in Jamnagar. “Additional healthcare facilities are one of the most critical needs of the hour. The first phase of 400 beds will be ready within a week,” said Reliance Foundation chairperson Nita Ambani. Industry body Ficci, along with its partner BVMW (German Association of Small and Medium Sized Enterprises) will procure 1,500 oxygen concentrators to combat the current crisis. “The first batch of the freight containing the medical devices and accessories is being airlifted from Frankfurt Airport today,” both said in a joint statement. SpiceJet airlifted 1,000 oxygen concentrators from Hong Kong to Delhi. Linde said so far eight cryogenic containers have arrived in India and “many more are expected over the next few weeks”. Cryogenic containers are tankers to carry liquid oxygen over long distances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cos-shut-ops-to-supply-o2-provide-bikes-to-medics-fighting-pandemic/articleshow/82299092.cms||---

The silver lining in the dark Covid cloud was that the daily coronavirus cases dipped for the first time in 27 days even though by a marginal 1.6%. With 8,595 discharges in 24 hours, the state recorded a daily recovery rate of 61%. This was 41% on April 23, five days ago. In absolute terms, the daily discharges increased from 5,618, recording a 53% rise in recovery. In another major relief to patients stuck in 8-48 hours of waiting for 108 ambulances, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) announced on Wednesday that it has withdrawn the earlier admission requirement in Covid hospitals through 108 emergency services only. The decision follows the Gujarat high court directive to the state government to do away with the policy to admit patients in AMC hospitals or 20% AMC quota beds in 161 Covid-designated hospitals through 108 only. “From April 29, 8 am onwards, anyone can use either a private ambulance, 108 service or any other private vehicles or just walk in for reaching all Covid hospitals in the city. Admissions shall be given by these hospitals if the patient requires so depending on the available beds in that hospital,” stated a letter issued by additional chief secretary Rajiv Kumar Gupta, who is in-charge of Covid-19 control in Ahmedabad. Gupta along with AMC commissioner Mukesh Kumar, who have been credited with taking sweeping decisions in the interest of Covid patients in the first and second wave of Covid in 2020, also withdrew the requirement of an Aadhaar card with an Ahmedabad address with immediate effect to facilitate quick admissions and treat patients requiring urgent care. “All Covid hospitals have been asked to put up big-sized display boards outside hospitals for the public at large and also provide real time information through the state portal,” said the release. The AMC directive also states that no Covid hospital shall deny admission to any and Covid patient requiring urgent attention on any technical grounds whatsoever. All the decisions are to be implemented from Thursday 8am and adequate time is provided for making necessary preparations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/silver-lining-daily-recovery-rate-up-by-53-in-5-days-in-gujarat/articleshow/82298622.cms||---

The order relates to Aptech’s entry into the pre-school segment as a business venture and the company’s failure to impose a no-trading rule by its insiders when the negotiations were on. This allowed some of the insiders to make illegal gains, Sebi said. The Sebi order also mentioned that 11 people, who were designated as insiders, and their relatives together had made unlawful gains aggregating Rs 12.7 crore because of the non-disclosure by the company. Although the Sebi order doesn’t mention it, in this same case billionaire investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala was also sent a show-cause notice for alleged illegal gains. Reportedly, Jhunjhunwala — the promoter of the company with a 48.5% stake — filed a consent plea with Sebi to settle the case by paying a fine. In its order, Sebi said had Aptech “effectively used the trading window mechanism as an instrument for preventing insider trading by the designated persons and their immediate relatives who are ‘insiders’, such wrongful gain made by them could have been averted”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-fines-jhunjhunwala-co-aptech-rs-1-crore/articleshow/82298994.cms||---

The design head of the group’s flagship Tata Motors, Pratap Bose, is leaving after a 14-year stint even as the homegrown automobile major searches for a CEO candidate to replace Guenter Butschek, who is on an extension till June-end. Richa Sharma of Tata Consumer Products too is on her way out after leading its packaged foods business for seven years. Coronavirus: Live updatesWhile Bose and Sharma are heading for greener pastures, others like TCS, Titan and Tata Elxsi’s chief financial officers V Ramakrishnan, S Subramaniam and Muralidharan H V, respectively, are superannuating. Recently, Renu Basu retired as senior VP (sales & marketing) at Indian Hotels Company (Taj) after more than a two-decade stint. Senior leadership exits are happening at the Tata Group at a time when the conglomerate is seeing mixed performance with some of its businesses languishing and others flourishing. Despite its myriad interests, TCS continues to be the biggest money spinner for the conglomerate. Group chairman emeritus Ratan Tata’s half-brother Noel Tata, who is MD at Tata International, will be relinquishing his executive responsibilities at the company this November when he turns 65. He, however, will continue as the non-executive chairman of Trent, Voltas and Tata Investment Corporation. According to Tata Group’s HR policy, executives superannuate at the age of 60, while executive directors retire at 65 and non-executive members at 70. Key positions across major Tata companies are increasingly being filled in by lateral hires as compared to a decade ago when internal executives were promoted to helm those roles. Bose, based in Warwick, UK, oversees three design centres of Tata Motors in Pune, Turin (Italy) and Coventry (UK). Tata Motors declined to comment on Bose’s departure. Bose has made significant contributions to all Tata Motors models that have been launched with the Impact 2.0 design element — from the hatchback Tiago to the SUV Harrier and the recently launched Safari. Sharma, who joined Tata Chemicals in 2014, moved to Tata Consumer Products after the latter acquired the foods portfolio from the former. The foods business was the second biggest contributor to Tata Consumer’s earnings during the third quarter of fiscal 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tatas-see-exits-of-sr-execs-amid-corona-storm/articleshow/82299057.cms||Reeba Zachariah

These executives include the fund house’s managing director/chief executive officer, chief investment officer, chief operating officer, fund managers, research analysts and some others who are directly involved in running each scheme. This rule will be effective July 1, 2021, Sebi said through a circular. The regulator believes that the management of risk return profile of MF schemes rests with the fund houses and its key employees. To align the interest of the key employees of the fund houses with the unitholders of the MF schemes, “it has been decided that a part of compensation of the key employees of (the fund houses) shall be paid in the form of units of the scheme(s),” the circular noted. According to the regulator, the compensation paid in the form of units should be proportionate to the assets under management of the schemes in which the key employee has a role or any oversight. Sebi said exchange-traded funds (ETFs), index funds, overnight funds and existing closed-ended schemes are excluded from this rule. All these units will be locked-in for three years. The lock-in rule will continue even if the person leaves the fund house. However, a fund house may put in place a system for its executives to borrow from the fund house “against such units in exigencies such as medical emergencies or on humanitarian grounds”, Sebi said. In case an executive retires from the fund house, the units could be released from the lock-in rule. According to Sebi, to allow key employees of fund houses to diversify their unit holdings, in case of dedicated fund managers managing only a single scheme/single category of schemes, “50% of the aforementioned compensation shall be by way of units of the scheme/category managed by the fund manager and the remaining 50% can, if they so desire, be by way of units of those schemes whose risk value as per the risk-o-meter is equivalent or higher than the scheme managed by the fund manager”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/top-mf-execs-to-get-20-of-pay-in-units/articleshow/82298982.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar: University teachers and staff demand exemption from physical attendance||PATNA: With the crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, teachers and non-teaching staff of the universities and the colleges have gone restive. They are at their wits’ end as to how to obey the government order of making physical attendance at their institutions in rotation, risking their lives. The Federation of University Teachers’ Associations of Bihar (FUTAB) has written a letter to the chief secretary, drawing his attention towards the untold sufferings faced by teachers in attending to their duties amid rising cases of people getting infected with the Covid-19 virus and demanding complete closure of all educational institutions till the situation normalizes. In the letter, FUTAB’s working president Kanhaiya Bahadur Sinha and general secretary Sanjay Kumar Singh, MLC, pointed out that there is hardly any rationale in calling the teachers and non-teaching staff to their respective departments when all the institutions are already closed till May 15 and all classes are being held online. All university examinations scheduled during the period also stand postponed. They further pointed out that more than a dozen teachers of Veer Kunwar Singh, Patliputra, Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur and Patna universities have succumbed to Covid-19 and several infected teachers are either admitted in hospitals or are in home isolation. Public transport used by most teachers for commuting are not at all safe at the moment. They urged the chief secretary to waive the condition of teachers making their physical attendance in colleges. Any teacher can be called anytime by the management in case of some urgent work, they added. Echoing almost similar feelings the Bihar State University Employees’ Federation has urged the chancellor to issue necessary orders for exempting the officers and staff of universities and colleges from attending their duties in person. In a memorandum submitted to the Raj Bhavan, Federation president Shankar Yadav pointed out that several officers and employees of different universities have been affected by the pandemic, creating an atmosphere of fear among all the staff. Hence, all the officers and staff should be allowed to work from home till May 15, he added. Patna University Employees’ Association’s president Subodh Kumar has submitted a memorandum to the vice-chancellor for closing all the units of the university, including offices, colleges and post-graduate departments completely from May 3 to 15 as a large number of employees have already been infected with the Covid-19 virus and are in isolation. In case of some important work, any employee can be asked to report to the university, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/university-teachers-and-staff-demand-exemption-from-physical-attendance/articleshow/82297276.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||Bihar: Covid hits income of Saran floriculturists||CHHAPRA: The Covid-19 has not only adversely impacted the marriage season, but also destroyed the prospects of farmers who spent money and labour on floriculture. The cultivators of different villages under Aquilpur panchayat in Dighwara block of Saran district are unable to get return on the capital invested in this business due to the postponement of marriages and other celebrations for the second consecutive year. Amit Kumar of Dighwara said flowers are cultivated in several villages like Dudhiya, Batrouli, Salhali and Bangalapar under the panchayat. Flowers have good marketing prospects in Patna, Chhapra, Muzaffarpur and Vaishali during marriage season, in temples during Durga Puja or other celebrations and political rallies. He said they suffered heavy losses due to the Covid-19, followed by postponement or simplification of marriages. “The famous Harihar Kshetra Sonepur Fair has been a major consumer of the flowers for a month, but unfortunately this fair had to be cancelled in 2020 and the same has been the fate of different festivals like Ram Navami, Durga Puja etc,” Amit said and added that all these have made the prospects of the farmers bleak. The floriculture has not only provided economic strength to the farmers, but several others like women engaged in making garlands and in the cultivation and marketing have also suffered economically, said locals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-hits-income-of-saran-floriculturists/articleshow/82296951.cms||H K Verma

VB vice-chancellor Bidyut Chakraborty, who is not even contesting, has come to represent the “iron hand” that drove a wedge between the town and Tagore’s Visva-Bharati. The perception has come in the way of BJP heavyweight Anirban Ganguly’s projecting Tagore’s Santiniketan and Sriniketan as a “home beyond home”. Ganguly had been trying to distance himself from the VC and work on the lines of BJP seniors — PM Modi and Amit Shah — to showcase BJP as a part of Tagore’s lineage and his vision. Ganguly reached out to the disgruntled teachers and students of Visva-Bharati and paid a visit to Amar Kutir to send out the message that he was alien to this grand culture. Outgoing minister and Trinamool candidate Chandranath Singha doesn’t forget to mention to Bolpur traders that the Visva-Bharati VC was appointed by the Modi government. The Visva-Bharati issue has come in handy for Singha to tell Bolpur residents and a section of ashramiks what the BJP can do to Santiniketan if the party comes to office. The debate on Visva-Bharati has traction among a larger audience in Santiniketan, Sriniketan and Bolpur town. “The VC cancelling Poush Mela and Basanta Utsav is not an affront to culture. It had a debilitating impact on the local economy and livelihoods of traders and artisans,” a VB inmate said. The importance of the issue becomes apparent from 2019 Lok Sabha poll results. The Left vote in four-time RSP MLA Tapan Hore’s turf depleted to 14,129, while the BJP vote count rose to 90,986 and Trinamool got 1,06,172 votes. BJP was leading in Trinamool Birbhum president Anubrata Mandal’s ward. Since then the BJP presence in Bolpur has increased. Trinamool leaders hope to regain ground among educated middle class in Bolpur by focusing on the Visva-Bharati issue. But the constituency also includes the Ilambazar town that has a mixed population, and three gram panchayats — Raipur-Supur, Ruppur and Sattor — inhabited by the Adivasis and sat chashis. The peace broke at Panrui four years ago when villagers took the BJP flag before the leaders reached the spot. Villages with heavy Hindu presence, like Ghurisa, have got consolidated, resulting in a sharp polarization in villages as in the minority-dominated Sattor villages. Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh made an intensive campaign in a bid to charge up the villagers scared of the Anubrata Mandal writ in Tagore’s land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/trinamool-pins-hopes-on-vb-issue-to-regain-ground-in-tagores-abode/articleshow/82298687.cms||Someswar Boral

This segment in north Kolkata goes to polls in the last phase of Bengal assembly elections on Thursday. Multiple hotbeds in the segment, like Hatibagan market, Sonagachhi, slums and the Kumartuli artisans’ colony, have overshadowed the excitement and chatter surrounding the elections this time. “I have done a lot of work in the constituency across all sections of people. During Amphan and Covid, our party members have extensively supported those in need,” said Panja, a two-time MLA from the constituency. Panja had been suffering from fever since April 17 and had gone into home isolation. Following a Covid-positive report, she was admitted to a private hospital on April 22 and her daughter Puja took over her campaign. She was discharged on Wednesday. “I will not head outdoor on poll day and will cast my vote in the last hour in a PPE,” she said. Intensifying their past few days of campaign, Trinamool put up posters across the constituency accusing the BJP candidate for spreading Covid, with a photograph of him hugging a child without a mask, apparently taken days before his report came positive. “It’s nasty politics by Trinamool. I wasn’t sick when the photo was taken. Trinamool knows people in this constituency want a real change and will vote for me. That is why they are spreading these fake messages. My agenda for the election includes eradication of gundaraj from Sonagachhi, rehabilitating artisans at Kumartuli and overall development of the slums,” said Biswas, a Trinamool turncoat who owns resorts in Mandarmani. Biswas said if he gets a Covid-negative report, he will step outside on Thursday, but will stay in his car. A Forward Bloc den for 20 years from 1991, Panja won the seat in 2011. However, during 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BJP had a minor lead of 2001 votes over Trinamool. “BJP had a lead thin lead banking on votes from Left supporters. This time, I am contesting again and all those votes will be back along with some new ones,” said Jiban Prakash Saha, the 71-year-old Forward Bloc candidate and two-time MLA between 2004 and 2011. “If we win, we will end the syndicate raj and focus on solving the traffic chaos around Shyambazar,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/virus-fear-subdues-poll-chatter-in-shyampukur/articleshow/82298738.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

For this initiative, Zoho has identified a team of around 50 people who have gone through basic health checks. “The whole team is screened daily; managers train the team and ensure that the safety protocols are being adhered to by everyone,” a Zoho official said. Springworks, a tech product startup based in Bengaluru, is providing freshly cooked food to daily wage labourers and their families in the city using their office kitchen. Starting off by serving over 200 labourers and their families-some of the people hardest hit due to Covid-19 and lockdowns — the initiative is being driven from the startup’s own funds and is run by employees with logistical support being taken care by NGO Robinhood Army. A team of employees and two cooks who live on the office premises drive the initiative. However, since Springworks founder and CEO Kartik Mandaville tweeted about their community kitchen four days back, donations have also started pouring in from people who wish to contribute by supplying grocery and provisions like rice etc for the kitchen. “We have received almost 700 kgs of rice since the donations started coming. Thanks to all the donations, we are now serving twice a day, around 400+ meals across morning and afternoon,” Mandaville said. Even with the current lockdown in Bengaluru, the team is looking at finishing distributions by 10 am in the morning. While some others are supporting feeding activities financially. Mid-tier software firm GAVS Tech, is supporting meals for Covid patients in Chennai’s Voluntary Health Services (VHS), a community hospital which mostly treats poor patients. With plans in place to contribute around Rs 5 lakh for the food cost currently, the company plans to scale this and do it for as long as the current crisis goes on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/as-india-reels-under-second-covid-wave-companies-re-start-community-kitchens/articleshow/82298705.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

Sixty-three-year-old Sunil Desai even survived a brain stroke in March this year. But he lost the battle against Coronavirus. After two weeks of treatment, Desai, who was quadriplegic, died at his home on April 21.“He tested positive on April 5 and immediately admitted to hospital for treatment. I also got admitted just to look after him as I didn’t want to leave him alone. The doctors put him on oxygen but his lung infection was severe. So, we brought him home on April 17 and kept him under home care,” said his wife Darshana Desai.“Our two daughters and sons-in-law took good care of him. On April 21, he passed away,” Desai told TOI. He had taken the first dose of vaccine on March 16. After few days, Desai suffered a brain stroke and was admitted to the hospital for treatment before he got infected with Covid.Desai had suffered severe injuries on his spinal cord when the bus he was travelling in met with an accident in Rajkot in 1996. He barely survived the mishap but it left his body below the neck dysfunctional. Doctors diagnosed him with quadriplegia following which Desai underwent a number of surgeries. But his condition didn’t improve. He had at one point of time thought of approaching the courts to request for ending his life through euthanasia.But he managed to pull himself together and started an old age care centre that took care of the ill and elderly by providing them helpers some years ago. “He had a zest for life and always wanted to help others. Though bed-ridden, he was always busy and at times even motivated us to achieve something in life. We will miss him,” Darshana added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/quadriplegic-who-ran-centre-to-help-elderly-loses-battle-against-covid-19/articleshow/82297245.cms||Tushar Tere

In the last three sessions, the sensex has added over 1,800 points to settle at 49,734 on Wednesday on the back of strong cues from global markets and positive results from leading domestic corporates. The gains on Tuesday came despite record daily new Covid cases, rising by more than 3.5 lakh, which economists say could hit the fragile economic recovery process. During these three sessions, combined investors’ wealth rose by Rs 6.4 lakh crore with BSE’s market capitalisation now at nearly Rs 211 lakh crore. On Wednesday, Nifty closed at 14,865, up 212 points. According to S Hariharan of Emkay Global Financial Services, sentiment has been boosted by a set of strong results and continuing strong momentum in global markets, which has overshadowed concerns over economic activity arising from renewed lockdowns and the second wave of Covid. “Metals & banking sectors in particular have seen renewed long open interest build-up (in the derivatives segment, which indicate bullishness), while the IT sector has lagged in a case of rotation of positioning,” Hariharan said. In the last three sessions, RIL rose nearly 5% after a foreign brokerage said that their interaction with about 100 fund managers abroad indicated that they were ready to wait for RIL to deliver over the long run. In Wednesday’s market, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Bajaj Finance contributed the most to the sensex’s gains. Of the 30 index constituents, 24 closed with gains. Technically, the Nifty may face a major resistance at 14,900 points, analysts said. Meanwhile, the rupee rose by 30 paise to close at a nearly two-week high of 74.36 against the US dollar on Wednesday, extending its gains for a third day on the back of a strong rally in domestic equities. At the interbank forex market, the local unit opened at 74.49 against the greenback and hit an intraday high of 74.29 and a low of 74.50. It finally ended at 74.36 against the American currency, registering a rise of 30 paise over its previous closing. On Tuesday, the rupee had settled at 74.66 against the American currency. This is the third straight session of gain for the domestic currency, during which it appreciated by 65 paise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-jumps-1800-pts-in-3-days-as-ril-banks-gain/articleshow/82298957.cms||---

Revenue from operations increased 37% to Rs 175 crore, the maker of Kamal Cement said on Wednesday. Operating profit grew 52% to Rs 49 crore in the last quarter of fiscal 2021. Pent-up demand as well as lower costs worked in favour of Shree Digvijay amid disruptions caused by the pandemic. Company chairman Anil Singhvi said its operating profit per ton was Rs 1,400 and operating margin of 28% was “one of the best in class”. Singhvi, however, remains cautiously optimistic about Shree Digvijay’s performance in this fiscal as challenges from the pandemic persist. Shares of the company ended marginally down by 0.14% at just under Rs 72 by close of Wednesday’s trade on the BSE. Commenting on Shree Digvijay’s performance, managing director Rajeev Nambiar said, “We were able to control the cost with record clinker and cement production and with smooth waste heat recovery operations.” For the whole year of 2020-21, the company clocked a profit of Rs 54 lakh on revenues of Rs 503 crore. As a result of the performance, Shree Digvijay will be paying a dividend of Rs 2.5 per share to its shareholders. Shree Digvijay is majority owned by private equity firm True North. Under True North’s management, the cement maker has turned from a loss-making entity to a profitable player.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/shree-digvijay-cements-q4-profit-up-18-at-rs-27cr/articleshow/82298912.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Pandemic-induced slowdown returns to haunt realty sector||VISAKHAPATNAM: The second wave of Covid-19 may lead to a downward revision in ratings of real estate projects in Andhra Pradesh due to delays and other issues. The developers are facing shortages and logistical problems with transporting construction material to sites as well as problems with labour. There may also be bottlenecks caused by drops in the production and transportation of the construction materials. The real estate sector, which was slowly returning to normalcy after the effects of the first wave of Covid-19, is again facing challenges during the second wave of the pandemic in cities like Vizag and Vijayawada. Speaking to TOI, B Raja Srinivas, president of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (CREDAI), Andhra Pradesh, said that the real estate sector in Andhra Pradesh has been depending on the northern states for construction materials such as tiles, electrical equipment, pipes and other materials for years. “The second wave of the pandemic may hit production of construction material as well as transport of the material. We are anticipating that real estate projects will be delayed in the state,” he said. “We have been facing at least 20%-30% shortage of skilled workers in the construction sector for the past one year. At present, the workers are not in a mood to return from their home states, but the delay in getting the construction material from other states may hit at least 30%-40% of the real estate projects in the state,” Srinivas added. “We are hoping that demand may recover faster for affordable housing and mid-price homes in cities like Vizag and Vijayawada in the coming days as remote working has encouraged people to buy houses in their hometowns,” said B Sunil, a real estate developer. Housing demand is likely to return to 2019 levels but only if the impact of the second wave is not prolonged, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/pandemic-induced-slowdown-returns-to-haunt-realty-sector/articleshow/82297707.cms||Nalla.Babu

Eyewitnesses spoke of hapless patients and kin moaning desperately amid chaos and consternation. Mani Mishra, who had carried his Covid critical father Shambhu Mishra from Bharwalia near Motihari, was seen frantically pleading for help. A ward boy found the patient’s oxygen saturation level dipped to 57. But there was no doctor on emergency duty. Mishra died before emergency services could be restored. He became one the four casualties at the GMCH on Tuesday. With another 10 patients dying on Wednesday, the death toll has so far mounted to 64 in the last 17 days. Meanwhile, with 719 fresh cases detected by Wednesday, the number of active cases in the district has risen to 3749. Shaukat Ali, an IAF techie from the Bihta airbase, had brought both his parents -- his mother on a wheelchair -- with severe Covid symptoms. He too met gloom as no doctor could be found. Ram Suchit Chowdhary from Sathi Hichopal village, physically challenged with an amputated leg, had been referred from the Narkatiaganj sub-divisional hospital on Monday night. “Had we known (that there would be no doctors), I would have kept him to fate at Narkatiaganj itself,” his son Harendra Prasad told reporters at the GMCH. Shivering with Covid-like symptoms, Yamuna Sharma was carried to this hospital by his wife and daughter from Chuhari village early morning. The 65-year-old died even before he could be tested. “Our medical fraternity is under extreme pressure,” hospital superintendent Pramod K Tiwary said, citing the rising number of patients and deaths that had compelled the hospital administration to marshal limited resources with practical ingenuity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/emergency-services-take-a-hit-for-four-hours-at-bettiah-hospital/articleshow/82297247.cms||---

Braving the scorching heat, people waited for hours for their turn at the centres. However, some centres faced an acute shortage of doses, particularly the Covaxin vials. Andhra Pradesh administered about 90,000 vaccine doses on Wednesday. In Visakhapatnam district alone, about 15,000 people received the vaccine. M Kali Prasad, who received the second dose of the vaccine on Wednesday, said that awareness seems to have increased about the benefits of the vaccine. “Several of my friends discouraged me when I had planned to get the first dose. But now they are also getting vaccinated to get protection from the novel coronavirus disease,” said Prasad, a banker. A special second dose vaccination drive was conducted at Swarna Bharathi Indoor Stadium of Vizag city. CPI(M) corporator Dr B Ganga Rao, in a letter, asked the GVMC mayor G Hari Venkta Kumari to increase the vaccination centres in the city to widen the reach of the drive. Due to the sudden spurt in the case numbers, a huge number of people have been flocking to the vaccination centres. However, as Andhra Pradesh is only receiving limited stocks, several vaccination centres had exhausted their stocks by afternoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vaccination-centres-see-heavy-rush/articleshow/82297544.cms||---

Clearly unable to move steadily, Parmar was flanked by his two relatives, one lifting his oxygen cylinder and another holding a drip bottle in his hands. A bag containing his urine was handled by yet another relative. “We have been carrying him around like this for the past three days,” said Akshayraj, his nephew. “A native of Lodhida village, about 27 km southeast from Rajkot, he had developed symptoms about six days ago and was breathless on the third day. His oxygen level went below 80%. We took him to almost every major government and private-run hospital in Rajkot in a van, but could not find an oxygen bed.” The group finally entered Ahmedabad with hope in their hearts. “A distant relative was admitted in Civil Hospital, and he said that with increase in beds recently, we might get lucky. We did not waste any time and drove overnight to reach hospital with two oxygen cylinders to sustain him. We waited for hours, but eventually got a bed,” said Akshayraj. The relatives admitted that it was not easy to manage him at home. They had consulted doctors and had started a few medicines. His son also learnt to operate the oxygen regulator whereas Parmar was given the injection and oral medication based on doctors’ advice. “We would wait for hours to get the oxygen, praying that the gas must sustain him till we reach home,” said a relative. “We are just hanging by a thread of hope that he would come out hale and hearty.” Civil Hospital authorities said that they have witnessed rise in patients from other districts and cities with exponential rise in cases everywhere and limited resources in terms of hospital beds, oxygen and medicines in some parts of Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/kin-roam-with-man-oxygen-cylinder-for-3-days/articleshow/82298591.cms||---

The silver lining in the dark Covid cloud was that the daily coronavirus cases dipped for the first time in 27 days even though by a marginal 1.6%. With 8,595 discharges in 24 hours, the state recorded a daily recovery rate of 61%. This was 41% on April 23, five days ago. In absolute terms, the daily discharges increased from 5,618, recording a 53% rise in recovery. In another major relief to patients stuck in 8-48 hours of waiting for 108 ambulances, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) announced on Wednesday that it has withdrawn the earlier admission requirement in Covid hospitals through 108 emergency services only. The decision follows the Gujarat high court directive to the state government to do away with the policy to admit patients in AMC hospitals or 20% AMC quota beds in 161 Covid-designated hospitals through 108 only. “From April 29, 8 am onwards, anyone can use either a private ambulance, 108 service or any other private vehicles or just walk in for reaching all Covid hospitals in the city. Admissions shall be given by these hospitals if the patient requires so depending on the available beds in that hospital,” stated a letter issued by additional chief secretary Rajiv Kumar Gupta, who is in-charge of Covid-19 control in Ahmedabad. Gupta along with AMC commissioner Mukesh Kumar, who have been credited with taking sweeping decisions in the interest of Covid patients in the first and second wave of Covid in 2020, also withdrew the requirement of an Aadhaar card with an Ahmedabad address with immediate effect to facilitate quick admissions and treat patients requiring urgent care. “All Covid hospitals have been asked to put up big-sized display boards outside hospitals for the public at large and also provide real time information through the state portal,” said the release. The AMC directive also states that no Covid hospital shall deny admission to any and Covid patient requiring urgent attention on any technical grounds whatsoever.

---||Business||Bad bank to get Rs 2 lakh crore of defaulting cos’ loans||Mumbai: The Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) has asked members to identify large loans where they are lead bankers and get approval from co-lenders so that these loans can be sold to a National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARC, or the bad bank). The association has identified 102 corporate bad loans, totalling to Rs 2 lakh crore, where the amount outstanding in each is over Rs 500 crore. They include loans in a variety of industries — including oil, steel, cement and roads. These have been languishing in the books of banks for years with many admitted under the insolvency process. These loans are almost fully provided for over the years and they exclude the ones where there is fraud involved or those currently under liquidation. Approval from 75% of the lenders by value is required to transfer the loans to an ARC. The IBA had proposed a public sector bad bank to take over bad loans of Indian lenders. A bad bank is expected to be more efficient in recovery as it will step into the shoes of multiple lenders who currently have different compulsions when it comes to resolving a bad loan. “In the first phase, lenders are expected to approve the transfer of 30-40 loans by next week,” said a senior banker. He said that the framework for transferring the loans from the books of banks is already in place. Once the lenders decide on selling the loan, the NARC will make them an offer based on the scope of recovery. With the NARC’s offer on hand, the lenders will hold a ‘Swiss Challenge’, where rivals are allowed to better the offer made by a chosen bidder. While rival ARCs in the private sector will be given an option to bid, it is unlikely they will succeed. This is because the security receipts issued by the NARC for 85% of the value of the loans would be guaranteed by the government. Since private companies do not have government guarantee, they can only hope to win if they can provide cash. The Swiss Challenge will enable the public sector banks to comply with RBI’s norms that require banks to sell loans through a price-discovery process rather than doing a one-to-one deal. The advantage for banks is that these 102 loans have been largely provided for. The NARC will be paying up to 15% of the agreed value for the loans in cash. The NARC is also expected to do a good job in recovery as it will create a trust that will assign the task to an asset management company (AMC) in the private sector.

---||Kolkata||TMC’s ‘leader next door’ focuses on Cov relief||Kolkata: He might be 75 now, and a two-time MLA, but he can still offer a lesson or two in public relations to any wannabe politician. Paresh Paul’s leader-next-door image is not only his USP in Beliaghata constituency — that even a decade ago was considered a Left bastion — but also one that helped him clinch nomination a third time beating “stiff competition”. Whether it’s setting up of busts across Beliaghata-Phoolbagan, arranging for mass weddings, holding citizens’ meets, organizing the Ilish Utsav or organizing Subhas Mela, even Paul’s biggest critics agree that few can match his visibility. His confidence at retaining the seat thus finds resonance even among his partymen. When TOI tried speaking to him on Wednesday, hours before the polls, his aide answered. “Dada is on his rounds meeting booth-level workers. You are aware of his image. He does not read the papers much but believes in reading the pulse of the people,” he said. A couple of hours later, the former MLA insisted on talking more about the Covid relief he is arranging than the election itself. “When someone studies each day, he is not worried about slogging the night before the exam. At present, my concern is my margin,” Paul said. Paul had won in 2016, defeating CPM’s Rajib Biswas by 26,179 votes. In the Lok Sabha polls, when Trinamool found the going tough in several hundred seats, Paul handed his party a lead of 50,902 votes. A major chunk of minority votes from Rajabazar is likely to stay with the party with locals insisting that the Sanjukta Morcha’s ISF is not finding much support here. However, Paul knows the fight will not be easy. Both opposition candidates insist that a “free and fair election” will change the outcome. “The ruling party has turned elections here into a farce since 2011. The voters are threatened and not allowed to vote. If democracy prevails, it will be the CPM that will win. People have witnessed Covid and seen which party has stood by them,” claimed Rajib Biswas, who is contesting here for the second successive time. BJP’s Kashinath Biswas has put his entire energy for the past one-and-a-half months in door-to-door campaigns rather than on big meetings and his effort has been noticed by residents. “I am confident. The Trinamool had built the lead in 2019 based on a bulk of minority votes and relied on their machinery to trounce democracy post 1pm. That will not happen this time,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmcs-leader-next-door-focuses-on-cov-relief/articleshow/82298684.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

It is for the third time in a week that the junior doctors have struck work over the same issue. NMCH is the dedicated Covid hospital in Patna. The junior doctors demanded deployment of paramilitary forces on the NMCH campus for creating a safe environment to discharge their duties. Taking serious note of the incident, Patna DM Dr Chandrasekhar Singh said an FIR has been lodged against the guilty persons. “Such incidents in a hospital with Covid patients would not be tolerated. Strict action would be taken against those who indulged in vandalism and violence and tried to stop the oxygen supply to the patients. However, within minutes, the officials present there restored the oxygen supply,” he said and added that the SDO and SDPO of Patna City were trying to restore the normal functioning. NMCH superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh said there were 375 Covid patients under treatment at the time of the incident. New admissions remained paralysed from about 11am. “Apart from damaging the glass windowpanes, furniture and electrical equipment, the irate group stopped the oxygen supply leading to sudden decline in the oxygen level in some serious patients. This critical situation continued for a few minutes but the officials’ promptness helped in restoring the supply chain soon,” he said. The NMCH Junior Doctors’ Association (JDA) president, Dr Ramchandra Kumar, said trouble began at 4.30am when some irate attendants entered inside after the death of a Covid patient. They assaulted the doctors, damaged property after which several doctors on duty ran for safety. He said some doctors had a miraculous escape after an attendant threw a big oxygen cylinder and hurled chairs and tables on them. “The doctors had to bolt themselves in a room. They called their colleagues who rushed there and saved them,” he said. He alleged that though the district administration had deployed policemen on the hospital campus, not even a single cop came to the rescue of doctors. The JDA also demanded ban on entry of attendants in the Covid wards, increase the number of nursing staff and ward boys. “We are working short of 150 interns due to postponement of MBBS examinations and hence there was an urgent need to depute 150 JRs, senior residents and assistant professors of PMCH in the NMCH,” Dr Ramchandra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nmch-junior-doctors-strike-work-after-vandalism-by-attendants/articleshow/82297190.cms||VK Tripathi

Singh was on oxygen support and arrangements were made to get him admitted to a hospital for treatment on Wednesday evening. However, he died while on the way to the hospital. On April 27 night, Priyadarshi died at a private hospital on Bootnath Road in the course of treatment. Sources quoting his family said he was earlier admitted to a private hospital but had to be shifted to NMCH due to lack of oxygen there. They said Priyadarshi’s family shifted him again to another private hospital from NMCH observing almost negligible care for patients there. Earlier on April 19, the high court lost one of its assistant registrars, Gagan Mishra. He died during Covid treatment at ESIC hospital in Bihta. He was also a Maithili stage artist. Later, on April 20, one of the deputy registrars cum senior secretary of the high court, Nasimul Hoda, died at his official residence in Adalatganj, Patna. He was to retire soon. At least two young judicial officers of Bihar Subordinate Judicial Service have succumbed to Covid-19 in the state so far. Sub-judge cum additional chief judicial magistrate Amit Kumar, posted at Patna civil court, died during treatment at a private hospital in Patna on April 26. He was a native of Bhadohi in Uttar Pradesh. Prior to Kumar, railway magistrate Manish Kumar, posted at Kiul, also died at a private hospital in Patna on April 20. He was a native of Basawanpur in Aurangabad. At least six judicial officers are still admitted in different hospitals across the state.

The district recorded two more deaths, taking the toll to 719. The two victims included a 33-year-old man, who died 12 days after testing positive despite having no comorbidities, and a 62-year-old diabetic man, who died six days after testing positive for the virus.Coimbatore city corporation continued to account for 60.78% of the cases the district recorded in the last one week. Officials said 888 people in the city tested positive until Wednesday evening. Of the 3,608 active cases, 1,187 are under home isolation. West zone, including R S Puram, Saibaba Colony, Vadavalli, accounted for the most number of people under home isolation at 338, followed by the east zone, including Peelamedu, Sitra, Kalapatti Road among others, which has 234 infected people.Pointing to the growing spread of the virus, the day saw the number of streets with more than three cases each jumping by 9.94%, from 684 streets to 752 streets.The bed strength in both government and private hospitals improved marginally with 686 beds available in government sector including ESI and CMCH, and 919 available in private facilities. Of the 1,605 free beds, 178 in the government sector and 478 in the private sector have oxygen and ventilator facilities.Only 5,051 people took the jab against the virus, taking total number of beneficiaries to 3,63,777 on Wednesday. The district had 5,350 doses. According to the district administration and health department, the prospect of vaccinating people between the age of 18 and 45 with the current disease burden is daunting. Officials suggested roping in engineering and nursing college students to help in the vaccination drive from May 1. “Engineering students can handle technical issues, like SMS and certificate issues. Nursing students can easily vaccinate 1,000-2,000 people a day with a health officer’s supervision,” city health officer Dr S Raja said. “Anganwadi workers can also be roped in to handle tokens and watch patients in observation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/963-new-cases-take-districts-coronavirus-tally-to-76259/articleshow/82299095.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||No coercive action against BRS, LRS applicants: HC||Hyderabad: The high court on Wednesday directed the state government not to take any coercive steps in BRS (building regularisation scheme) and LRS (Layout Regularisation Scheme) GOs till the Supreme Court decides the validity of these schemes. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy said this while closing a batch of petitions pending in the high court. “As the apex court is seized of the matter, the best course is to wait for the outcome,” they said. Several states were resorting to regularisation schemes and scores of petitions were reaching the Supreme Court. The SC had made several states, which introduced such schemes as respondents, and sought to know from them the rationale behind these schemes. Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu were among those who received notices from the SC. As the apex court is now examining the validity of BRS and LRS, there was no point in keeping them pending here, the bench said before closing them. Sivaraju Srinivas, counsel for one of the petitioners, brought to the notice of the court the interim order given by the high court on Oct 18, 2016, asking the state to receive the applications for regularisation but not to take any final decision in them. He urged the court to ensure that the protection accorded to scores of people through this interim order remains intact even after the closure of these pleas. The bench asked the state not to take any coercive steps till the apex court adjudicates the validity of its LRS and BRS GOs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-coercive-action-against-brs-lrs-applicants-hc/articleshow/82299102.cms||---

Ramalingam disowned the banner. “The banner was put up by people who did not belong to AIADMK during the election campaign in March. Local AIADMK functionaries spotted it and removed it as it was a violation of election code. Now, a photograph of the banner is being circulated in an attempt to defame me and the party,” he said.The banner, which was kept at Palayakottai panchayat, had images of late chief ministers C N Annadurai, M G Ramachandran and J Jayalalithaa, besides chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, his deputy O Panneerselvam and Ramalingam. The wordings on the banner profusely thanked voters and party cadres for helping Ramalingam win with a margin of 13,483 votes.As soon as the issue was brought to his notice, he had contacted party functionaries, Ramalingam said. “They had no knowledge about those behind the banner. Since the name of the printing press was not there, we could not trace them,” he said. “I have decided to lodge a police complaint.” In 2016, AIADMK had allotted the Kangayam segment to Kongu Ilaignar Peravai leader U Thaniyarasu, who won with a margin of 13,135 votes. This election, AIADMK retained the seat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/banner-proclaiming-aiadmk-win-by-13483-votes-in-kangayam-creates-buzz/articleshow/82299100.cms||Mayilvaganan

---||Pune||Maharashtra will move to dry swab method that gives nCoV results in four hours||PUNE: Covid-19 test reports will soon be available in four hours as the state government moves in to adopt the dry swab technology for RT-PCR tests. It scores over the traditional method of RT-PCT tests as nasal and throat swabs are collected and transported in a dry state without the expensive liquid viral transport medium making the handling of samples easy and less prone to spillage and spread of infection. The testing omits the RNA isolation step from the sample cutting down on the time to process the results from 12 hours to just four hours. Maharashtra increased daily testing from 1,20,000 per day to 2,50,000 in the first two weeks of April. It has remained in this range since then. State task force member Shashank Joshi told TOI that the state will soon adopt the ICMR-approved dry swab technology in all the laboratories. “The CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) has developed this technology. Citizens have been complaining that the wait for the RT-PCR results stretches 12 to 13 hours which will now reduce to four hours with the dry swab direct RT-PCR method,” Joshi added CCMB’s director Rakesh Mishra said the method would scale up testing with no new investment. “Considering its minimal cost and quick turnaround time, it is expected to benefit more citizens,” he added. He said the new testing takes four hours for some 500 samples. VTM and RNA extraction both add a significant burden on costs and time required for mass testing for the coronavirus, he added. “The RNA isolation from the sample takes up time, cost and trained manpower. The dry swap method is cost- effective, easy to implement with no requirement of new kits and can be done with the current manpower. It can make a significant contribution to ramping up the testing capacity,” Mishra said. Director-general of CSIR Shekhar Mande said the institute’s innovation was helpful in a difficult time. Doctors emphasize that early detection of the virus helps in quarantining confirmed cases and stems spread of Covid-19. Many laboratories take 24-48 hours to schedule appointments for home collection of samples. “The laboratory said they had no staff for home collection and they were overburdened with testing,” said a Covid-19 positive patient. Others said Covid-19 negative reports came promptly, but the positive report takes nearly three days. The delay leads to panic among patients, treating physicians said. “It takes two days to get a Covid-19 test done and another 2-3 days to get the report. If positive, the patient starts scouting for a hospital bed though they may not need one,” a treating physician from a hospital in Pune said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/govt-will-move-to-dry-swab-method-that-gives-ncov-results-in-four-hours/articleshow/82299099.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Kunte said the other vaccine options were being studied. “Some vaccines have cold chain requirements that may not be available in the interior parts of the state. We have to study those aspects in greater details before arriving at a conclusion,” he said, adding that the state would be open to other options as and when they become available with no logistical issues. “We will talk to experts too about it,” he said. State health minister Rajesh Tope too said on Wednesday that the state would ready the cold chain facilities, if needed, by ramping up the existing infrastructure. “We are checking the availability of the existing vaccines in the country and will be open to foreign vaccines too,” the minister said, while expressing concerns over the indemnity clause for these vaccines and the temperatures required for them. He said the Centre should speed up the immunisation drive with the disbursement of Sputnik V vaccine to the state. Niti Aayog member Dr Vinod Paul had earlier told TOI that even if the vaccines had to be stored in very low temperatures, it could be done in the urban areas as the need of the hour was more vaccines. The Centre has allowed granting of emergency licence for vaccines approved by the US, the UK, Europe, Japan, or the WHO. However, unlike many other countries, India does not offer any liability shield and vaccine makers will be held liable for any complications or adverse effects that arise from the administration of their jabs, experts said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-global-tender-yet-for-vax-says-state-chief-secy/articleshow/82299105.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The state government had demanded 73 lakh doses from Serum Institute of India, but the manufacturer has not responded to the demand. State health minister Dr Rajeev Saizal said around 31 lakh vaccines were required. “We had made all preparations to launch the drive from May 1, but now non-availability of vaccines has made it difficult to start it on May 1,” he added. Saizal said the date for restarting the drive was undecided and they would reach a decision when the next stock arrives. The Himachal Pradesh cabinet, in its meeting held on April 22, had decided to provide free of cost vaccination to people between 18 and 44 years in government health institutions. A spokesperson of the health department said the state had vaccinated more than 20% population and was amongst the leading states in the country in vaccination drive. He said the registration for the age group had been started on the Co-WIN portal and service could now also be availed on the Aarogya Setu app. The number of estimated persons in the state eligible for vaccination under this category was around 31 lakh. To vaccinate these persons, the state had already placed an order of 73 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccine to be procured from the Serum Institute of India in a phased manner. It has been communicated by the manufacturer that the supplies shall commence after 3-4 weeks, subsequent to which the third phase of vaccination shall be started in the state in government CVCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hp-to-take-vax-call-after-stock-arrival/articleshow/82299127.cms||---

The elderly man told TOI that he had approached a PHC doctor to get a wheelchair for his wife. “The duty doctor said they didn’t have wheelchairs for vaccine beneficiaries and told me that we should have brought one from home, if required one. None of the staff members offered to help me carry her inside.”Jaganathan was left with no other option, but to carry his wife Vijaylakshmi, who has been suffering from rheumatoid arthritis for years and unable to walk, himself to the PHC. “Other people there offered to help, but I chose to carry her myself.” The couple had to then wait another 90 minutes to get inoculated. “The only concession they gave us was allowing my wife to sit, while I stood in the queue,” he said.The fact that the PHC, which is expected to be equipped to perform both normal deliveries and C-sections, and provide emergency first aids, didn’t have a simple wheelchair to offer has shocked even health department officials. “We will ensure all PHCs are disabled-friendly and equipped with wheelchairs,” a health officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/76-yr-old-man-forced-to-carry-ailing-wife-to-vaccination-centre/articleshow/82299107.cms||---

Support is being provided under Mission COVID Suraksha for clinical studies . The facility at Gennova has a monthly production capacity of 40–60 million doses and a plan is in place to boost that to 100–120 million doses by 2022,” she said.As for Sputnik V, Swarup said the technology transfer from the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) is in process and doses are expected to be available soon. “Talks are also on with Pfizer,” she said. On the scaling up of domestic production capacity to meet increased demand after May 1, Swarup said, “Scaling up of manufacturing takes time. But considering there are three vaccines in India that are already in an augmentation mode, it will not be difficult to fulfil the obligation of vaccinating those over 18.” She added, “The DBT is facilitating augmentation of Covaxin production at a cost of Rs 200 crore. It is expected the current manufacturing of Covaxin of 10 million doses per month will be enhanced to nearly 100 million doses per month in the next few months.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/plans-on-to-up-production-of-3-key-vaccines-top-official/articleshow/82299109.cms||Neha Madaan

According to deputy director Amlendu Pathak, the carcass was noticed by patrolling party around 12:30pm. Senior officers were informed immediately and the area was cordoned off. “Surrounding area up to 1km was scanned for circumstantial evidence and there were signs and marks of fighting between two individuals,” said Pathak. The dead animal was female, around two years, and had external injury marks on the forelimbs, hind limbs, neck and throat portion. A post-mortem was performed by a veterinary team comprising Dr Chetan Patond, Pench, Dr Datta Jadhav, livestock development officer (LDO), and Dr Ashwini Gadmade in the presence of local eco-development committee (EDC) president Sahdev Tekam, WII Researcher Yash Dabholkar and other officers. Pathak said the vertebral column (cervical vertebrae), lower jaw and right humerus of the leopard were found to be broken with multiple bite marks on the body. A post-mortem examination revealed that the animal died as a result of trauma to the vertebral column, thoracic cavity, trachea and other organs. There were multiple bite marks and other injuries suggestive of the territorial fight and the individual would have been killed by a bigger and more powerful carnivore. “All the body parts were intact. The body was incinerated in presence of all officers and representatives. The entire process was performed as per the NTCA SOP,” said Pathak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2-year-old-leopard-found-dead-in-pench/articleshow/82299132.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

To avoid the last-minute chaos, the civic bodies had rounds of meetings with Delhi government officials, including district magistrates, for early supply of material, like CCTV cameras, data entry operators and civil defence volunteers. They also sought approval of all the sites after physical verification. North Delhi Municipal Corporation, which plans to add 22 centres to its existing 55, is yet to get all the equipment in place. “Though these 22 centres were a part of the 77 sites approved by the district administration earlier, we are yet to get details about the facilities from the district offices and DDMA. The concern was raised by the nodal officer during a joint meeting on Thursday. Looking at the existing arrangement, it seems unlikely that the exercise will start on Saturday at all the centres. I have sought details from my officials and will pursue the issue with Delhi government on Friday,” said the corporation mayor Jai Prakash. Targeting vaccination for all eligible people by September-end in its areas, East Delhi Municipal Corporation and three district administrations on Thursday formed a “Team Vaccination East” comprising senior officials from EDMC, districts of East, Shahdara and North East. “At the meeting, which was attended by the three DMs and EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand, a call to expedite the process for getting all the approvals and arranging necessary infrastructure for setting up the new centres was taken,” said an EDMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/day-ahead-of-drive-corpns-struggle-to-get-approvals/articleshow/82317911.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Coverage plunges but fresh Covishield stock lifts hopes||Pune: The district recorded a dismal Covid vaccination coverage of just 12,211 beneficiaries on Wednesday. It was the second time in five days that the region has had less than 13,000 vaccine recipients. On April 25, only 10,397 citizens were given their shots. Officials said the serious fall in numbers — from highs of nearly 85,000 beneficiaries in early April — was caused by the shortage of vaccine doses across the district. The situation, however, is expected to improve from Thursday. Late on Wednesday, the district received a fresh batch of 80,000 Covishield doses. The stock, officials said, could be enough to ensure good coverage for at least the next two days.Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “The shortage of doses has impacted the region's vaccination drive. But with the fresh stock, we should be able to conduct the drive more smoothly.”A health department official, who did not wish to be named, said confusion over vaccine supply, ahead of the expanded May 1 drive for the 18-44 age group, has affected distribution and allocation in the district. In Pimpri Chinchwad, civic officials said they have told citizens that vaccinations will continue on Thursday at designated sites. On Wednesday, the PCMC had just 24 operational vaccination sites. Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Hospital Board of India, said vaccination sites of private hospitals have been shut mainly because of shortages. “We will be able to continue with our drives if we get more doses,” he said. Out of Wednesday's total of 12,211 beneficiaries, the PMC recorded 3,783 recipients. The PCMC had 2,287 beneficiaries and the Pune rural administration covered 6,141 people. Nearly 300 sites in the Pune Metropolitan Region were unable to launch sessions due to the vaccine shortage, officials said.Scores of citizens have been affected by the limited number of vaccination sites. Many said they have been unable to find appointment slots anywhere in Pune. And those walking in for their shots have reported long queues outside the vaccination centres — some that started to form as early as 6am. In many instances, senior citizens had to wait for hours for their jabs.Officials said the number of operational sites in the region will increase once vaccine supply to the region becomes steady. One senior official from the health department said citizens will not see vaccine slots unless hospitals activate sessions for that particular date. “They can do that only if they have enough vaccine doses,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/coverage-plunges-but-fresh-covishield-stock-lifts-hopes/articleshow/82299116.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Amid vaccine shortage, only 2nd dose seekers requested to get jabs today||MUMBAI: Citing an acute shortage of Covid-19 vaccines in the city, the civic body on Wednesday requested that only those due for their second doses should approach the centres on Thursday. The BMC said that 40 of the 73 private vaccination centres will remain shut. All public centres, on the other hand, will open after 12pm as they received a fresh stock of Covishield late on Wednesday. The BMC, in a statement released on Wednesday, said Mumbai was left with merely 47,740 doses around 2pm. And given the speed of vaccination, the remaining stock was likely to be fully utilised by the end of the day. Vaccination goes on till 8pm at several centres. On Wednesday, 44,629 people were vaccinated, a 39% drop from a record 72,606 vaccinations seen just the previous day. By 4pm, the BMC had tweeted that Worli Koliwada, Maa Hospital, Ramabai Thackeray, M T Agrawal, Wockhardt,Prince Ali Khan, Lilavati, Zen Multispecialty, CAMA and RCF (Chembur) had all run out of vaccines. Dr Mangala Gomare, the BMC’s executive health officer, said public centres will get vaccines on Thursday, but were unsure how many doses would arrive. An official said if vaccines arrive from Pune (state’s main depot) late on Wednesday, it will be distributed early on Thursday. “But if the stock arrives too late, distribution to so many centres may be a challenge” said a civic official. Since January, Mumbai has received a total of 24,58,600 vaccines of which 24,10,860 have been used. Incidentally, Mumbai’s stockout happened on a day the Centre called out Maharashtra for saying that vaccination was impacted by erratic supply of doses. The Centre said, “There have been media reports quoting some Maharashtra officials pointing out that the vaccines in the state are finished, thereby adversely impacting the vaccination drive in the state. It is clarified that the total doses received by Maharashtra as on April 28 are 1,58,62,470.” It added that after consuming 1.5 crore doses, the state had a balance of 5,06,319 vaccines while another 5 lakh were in the pipeline. State officials, though, contested the claim that doses were lying idle. “Districts that are vaccinating in big numbers are the ones running out of stocks quickly. The Centre has not been able to replenish them at the same speed,” an official said. “Mumbai alone vaccinated over 70,000 on Tuesday, Thane did 40,554 while Nashik and Pune did 35,454 and 31,430 vaccinations, respectively, in a day,” he added. Rajesh Tope, the state’s public health minister has maintained that the state’s had a capacity to vaccinate 8 lakh but could vaccinate only 3 lakh-4 lakh on most days. Besides Mumbai, the Thane corporation, too, exhausted its stock of vaccines, following which mayor Naresh Mhaske announced that the drive will be suspended at all 42 centres from Thursday till stocks arrive. Some of the 14 private hospitals assigned to deliver may continue if they have stock pending. “We have not got any fresh stock of the vaccine and will be forced to shut the drives at all our 42 centres. The response to vaccination from Thane residents was encouraging and we hope the fresh batch arrives soon,” said Mhaske. What brought some cheer was Palghar district crossing 2 lakh vaccinations. The eight talukas of the district have administered 2,07,849 vaccine doses. Of these, 1,74,645 people have received their first dose.

This is not to ferry his customers but get a free mask. After donating thousands of turbans from their ‘turban bank’ to manufacture masks during the first wave of Covid-19, the Sikh community members in the city are again leading by example by organising a mask langar to distribute free double-layered face shields to the needy people. Kawaljeet Singh Manu, president, Yuwa Sikh Morcha told TOI that the community has now launched the mask langar near Sangeet Talkies crossing, where free masks are distributed from 10am to 12 noon. So far, good Samaritans have distributed more than 10,000 masks to healthcare professionals and people in need. “In second wave, price of not just essential medicines but also masks have doubled... When we went to buy a mask, we noticed that the prices had hit the roof. We thought how would a poor man be able to protect himself. Then we decided to make masks at gurudwaras and hired tailors,” he said. “We have come across people, who can’t afford to buy masks for themselves and their family members. Therefore, we have launched a mask langar for them,” he added. This comes on the heels of a gurudwara in Ghaziabad giving a new lease of life to Covid-19 patients gasping for breath by opening oxygen langar for them and refilling cylinders for free.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/mask-langar-offers-free-masks-to-needy/articleshow/82299533.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Pune||Man held on charge of torching two cars over dispute||Pune: The Vishrantwadi police on Tuesday arrested Ashok Mahadev Kamble (52) of Dhanori on the charge of torching two cars parked on a road on Tuesday afternoon, following a dispute with his neighbour. Medical practitioner Ramchandra Prabhakar Chaure (41) lodged a complaint in this regard with the police on Tuesday evening. Both the cars were completely damaged in the incident. The police said Kamble was a casual worker and generally stayed at home. Chaure and another resident, Sohail Pathan, stayed in the neighbourhood and parked their cars on the road. Chaure and Pathan’s cars were damaged in the incident. Kamble and Chaure were having disputes for the past few months owing to commute through a passage in the housing area. Kamble and Chaure had filed a couple of non-cognisable offences against each other with the Vishrantwadi police in the past. A few days ago, Chaure and Kamble picked up an argument with each other. On Tuesday afternoon, when the majority of the residents were inside their homes, Kamble came out and put some inflammable material on the cars and set them ablaze. The police said, “It was not known what material Kamble used to torch the two vehicles.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-held-on-charge-of-torching-two-cars-over-dispute/articleshow/82299117.cms||---

Additional director general of prisons Sunil Ramanand has issued a communication in this regard to all the prison superintendents in the state while citing a directive issued by the Bombay High Court while hearing a suo motu PIL on April 20. In its directive, the HC bench comprising Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice GS Kulkarni stated: “Henceforth, immediately upon arrest of an individual on the ground that his complicity in a crime has transpired, the arresting police officer and the officer in-charge of the police station to which such arresting police officer is attached shall arrange for Rapid Antigen and RT-PCR tests of such arrested accused and if within a few days of receipt of the report he is remanded to judicial custody, he shall not be lodged in the correctional homes unless the report shows that the virus in him was not detected, or that it is a negative report.” The bench added: “In case the arrested accused tests positive, he shall be lodged in the temporary prisons/Covid care centres. We also direct that any accused in excess of 45 years of age, upon arrest, shall be sent for vaccination to the nearest vaccination centre without fail.” Accordingly all prison superintendents have personally reached out to the commissioners as well as superintendents of police having jurisdiction at their prisons and requested them for implementation of the order. As per the protocol, before officially making an arrest, the suspect has to compulsorily undergo medical test. And within 24 hours of arrest, the suspect is to be produced before court for seeking police custody. In accordance with the directives, rapid antigen test as well as RT-PCR will be conducted at the time of medical tests of the suspect. “The RT-PCR result takes about 24 hours, which means while presenting the accused in he court, police will have his test reports concluding to be positive or negative,” said Aurangabad commissioner of police Nikhil Gupta. Osmanabad superintendent of police Raj Tilak Roushan said that an accused aged above 45, on being found negative, will be taken to the nearest state- or civic body-run health facility and will be vaccinated. Aurangabad Central Prison superintendent Jayant Naik said they have started admitting inmates with RT-PCR and antigen test reports only. Earlier, due to a long wait period for RT-PCR results, police conducted antigen tests on arrested suspects. The prison authorities across the state have made separate arrangements for isolating every inmate for 14 days before he or she is shifted to the main prison.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/maha-police-to-inoculate-45-suspects-after-arrest/articleshow/82296376.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The varsity will also be taking placements online so that even students from colleges located in remote areas can register and get an opportunity to try their hand in securing a job. To make this possible, JNTUH formed a college placement umbrella (CPU), which will work closely with the training and placement officers of all the engineering colleges. “Right now, companies are visiting only a few colleges for campus placements. Several colleges, especially those located in rural and remote areas, have no placements, and students from these colleges are forced to do additional courses after engineering to get a job,” said M Sesha Rao, head, CPU, adding that their main motive is to help these students. “The entire selection process will be conducted online through this platform. Any student can register and be part of the placement process. This is going to benefit rural students,” said M Manzoor Hussain, registrar, JNTUH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jntuhs-placement-cell-for-students-from-remote-areas/articleshow/82299122.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad joins campaign to reduce carbon emission||Aurangabad: Aurangabad is among five cities from Maharashtra who will join the ‘Race to Zero’ campaign aimed at achieving net zero carbon emission. The other cities include Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur and Nashik, civic authorities said, referring to latest announcement by state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray. The global campaign by cities which are committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 is known as ‘Race to Zero.’ The objective of this campaign is to build momentum towards decarbonized economy ahead of COP26, the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow scheduled to be held later this year. Responding to this development, Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) administrator Astik Kumar Pandey said that the city will have to take environmental-friendly decisions as a part of the campaign. “We have already started taking steps towards the net zero target and strengthening our solid waste management, river rejuvenation and developing cycling infrastructure in the city as part of the same. But, there is a long way to go and we will need partnership of all stakeholders,” he said. As part of the Paris agreement signed in December 2015, almost 200 countries pledged to control greenhouse gas emissions so that the global rise in temperature can be limited to two degrees celsius and to keep warming at or below 1.5 degrees celsius. “Towards achieving this goal, many cities across the world have committed to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions to net zero. It means converting public and private vehicles to run on electricity as much as possible. Cities also would encourage industries to switch to wind power, hydro power, solar power, and geothermal for their operations to reduce carbon emissions,” Pandey said. To compensate for unavoidable carbon emissions, the cities must plant trees to absorb the carbon dioxide so that overall emissions balances out to be zero. Such an effort to increase the green cover is already underway in Aurangabad, civic administration has said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-joins-campaign-to-reduce-carbon-emission/articleshow/82296380.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Vaccination sessions at private hospitals likely to stop for next two months||PUNE: Private hospitals in the Pune civic limits are in a fix over holding their regular vaccination sessions after Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials on Wednesday told them to source the doses directly from the vaccine manufacturers. The move is likely to halt the vaccination sessions at private hospitals in the Pune civic limits for the next two months, starting May 1. The PMC has asked the private hospitals to return their unused doses (from the existing supply) before May 1. PMC officials, however, claimed that vaccination sessions would continue at government/municipal corporation hospitals according to the availability of doses. A doctor from Joshi Hospital, requesting anonymity, said, “The PMC officials have washed their hands of the responsibility of providing us with the vaccine doses from May 1. They have asked us to approach the manufacturers. When approached, Serum Institute of India (SII) officials expressed their inability to supply any doses to private hospitals at least for the next two months, citing prior commitments to the Union and state government.” Officials of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) sounded clueless about the fate of the vaccination drive at private hospitals in their jurisdiction after May 1. They clarified that it would continue at government/PCMC-run vaccination centres according to the availability of stock. The rural parts of Pune would continue with the vaccination drive at private and public hospitals even after May 1, Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer (CEO), Pune Zilla Parishad, said. “We shall be continuously supplying doses to private hospitals in our limits. We supply approximately 3,000-4,000 doses to them daily,” he said. The Maharashtra government on Wednesday made it clear that it would be deferring the Covid vaccination drive for the 18-44 year age group from May 1 because of constraints of vaccine availability. The new vaccine policy stipulates that the state government and private hospitals arrange for their own procurement. Sanjay Lalwani, medical director of Bharati Hospital — one of the biggest Covid vaccination centres in the city — said, “Currently, 90% vaccination is done with Covishield and, hence, SII remains our first major point of supply. SII officials told us that they would require at least 2-3 months to ramp up production.” According to the PMC officials, the decision of stopping the supply of vaccines to private hospitals has been taken after the state government’s directive. “We will take a call about providing vaccines to private hospitals if we get any directives from the state government,” said Suryakant Deokar, immunisation officer of the PMC. Deokar said the civic body would continue to vaccinate beneficiaries in the PMC-run hospitals after May 1. “Yes, the drive will continue. It will, however, be subject to stock availability,” he said. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical) of health services, Pune circle, said government and private vaccination sites had been told to exhaust their stock by April 30, as the guidelines after it would be conveyed accordingly. Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil said the inconsistent provision of vaccine stock had led to an inconsistent response to the drive. “We had aimed at around 25,000 vaccinations per day, but it has not been possible because of the supply shortage,” he said. There are 580 vaccination centres in the Pune district. Of them, about 200 vaccination centres are in private sector/hospitals.

A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli took on record the latest order passed by the government and disposed of the suo motu petition initiated on April 27. The court had taken cognisance of the news reports, which said 100 rooms of Ashok Hotel had been converted into a Covid health facility for judges of Delhi High Court on its request. The high court said no communication of this kind was made to anyone in this regard. At the outset, Delhi government standing counsel Santosh K Tripathi informed the bench that the April 25 order requisitioning 100 rooms of the hotel for setting up Covid-19 facilities for judges and their families, has been withdrawn with immediate effect. “This is very misleading. The high court has not made any such request for setting up beds in any such five star hotel,” the bench had said and added that the order passed by the sub-divisional magistrate was wrong as the state cannot create a facility exclusively for a class. pti||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/withdrawn-order-on-a-100-bed-facility-for-judges-govt-tells-hc/articleshow/82317919.cms||---

Ten of the infected students are girls. Three teachers had also been found positive. Umedh Singh, the director, was booked under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and under Sections of Disaster Management Act. He was later bailed out. On April 26, a team of health department and civil administration headed by naib tehsildar Arjun Singh Grewal visited Career Point Gurukul and found the management had opened the school and classes were going on. Children were found residing in a hostel. Grewal said, “We have isolated the positive students. Those tested negative have been sent home. Prior to raid, many parents had already taken their wards back home after finding them to be suffering from fever.” A parents’ association claimed many parents had complained that their children were suffering from fever for past five to six days. The school management had then claimed that due to wheat harvesting season, children do get such fever. Parents alleged the management gave 10 to 15 Paracetamol tablets daily to such students. Parents alleged the management did not inform them about students suffering from fever and did not offer proper medical aid. Parents too test positive Sources said after most of the parents who took their wards back home have also tested positive for Covid-19. One of the parents said, “When we came to know that our child is suffering from sore throat, we drove down to Mohali and took him away. After reaching home, we got our tests conducted and found that we have also been infected.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/after-42-kids-are-infected-residential-school-director-held/articleshow/82279595.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 37 univs get UGC nod to offer fully online courses||Mumbai: In a first big step towards opening up the higher education space, 37 universities in India will offer fully online programmes with an unlimited student intake capacity. From an array of undergraduate programmes in commerce and public policy to full-time MBA and MCA courses, these online programmes would also be the gateway to attract foreign students whose numbers have remained abysmally low, and dipped further due to Covid. Up until now, the University Grants Commission had permitted only Open and Distance Learning (ODL)education, but has now opened up to the idea of fully online courses too. Of those institutions that made the cut to offer online programmes, 13 are state universities, 17 are deemed universities, 4 are private and three central universities. Institutes with a NAAC score of at least 3.26 or a rank in the top 100 in university category of NIRF (National Institutional Ranking Framework) in at least two of the last three cycles can open their doors to international students too. “These insitutes can also start 13 programmes, three undergraduate and 10 postgraduate online courses without any kind of UGC permission,” said a senior UGC officer. Maharashtra has four deemed universities that will offer online programmes — Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies, DY Patil Vidyapeeth, Bharti Vidyapeeth and Symbiosis International.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-37-univs-get-ugc-nod-to-offer-fully-online-courses/articleshow/82300313.cms||---

However, ventilators continue to remain occupied in government and private hospitals in the city with not a single such facility available by Wednesday evening. The rural areas of Aurangabad district, which cover nine talukas, largely have Covid Care Centres(CCCs) in place during the current pandemic which were showing availability of 899 non-oxygen/isolation beds by Wednesday evening. President of Aurangabad chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA) Dr. Santosh Ranjalkar on Wednesday said that it was encouraging to see flattening of Covid curve and, in turn, reduced burden of health machinery. “Even if there is a drop in active cases of Covid-19, the society at large should not become complacent at all. The next at least three-months are crucial in battle against Covid-19. As a part of multi-pronged strategy, mass vaccination is highly essential to wage an effective war against Covid-19 and, therefore, everyone above 18-years of age should undergo immunization without fail,” he said. Besides eased out situation of bed crunch, the IMA office-bearers said they were receiving less frantic calls for remdesivir injection among other anti-viral drugs. “The district administration has kept an effective watch on smooth supply of the injections. The frantic calls we used to receive have come down in numbers as compared to earlier. The smooth supply of drugs is prerequisite to bring down active cases,” Ranjalkar said. Meanwhile, besides Mazi Health Mazya Hati (MHMH) mobile app, the updates about bed availability can be also seen on bamu.ac.in/covid and aicbamu.org.in/covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/bed-crunch-eases-out-ventilators-still-unavailable/articleshow/82296378.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC plans 227 centres in corporator wards to vaccinate all aged above 18||MUMBAI: The BMC started reaching out to all its 227 corporators on Wednesday asking for locations where they may want to set up vaccination centres. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said all the 227 centres would be open to citizens aged above 18 years. “The 63 existing BMC and government vaccination centres will be available for those in the age category of 45 years plus. New 227 BMC centres will be opened, one in each corporator ward and for all citizens in the 18 years plus category,” said Chahal. Currently, too, there are 73 vaccination centres in private hospitals, which would be increased to 100 to vaccinate all citizens aged above 18. Civic corporators, though, have demanded that these centres must be started only if the BMC can be assured of definite stocks of the vaccines. Samajawadi Party corporator and MLA Rais Shaikh said they have identified a hall at Clare Road in Byculla where a vaccination centre could be started. “The hall is well-ventilated and can occupy a large number of people while ensuring physical distancing. However, I feel that only one centre may not be enough, especially for people who have to travel from far. Besides, for Muslim community members, I will be requesting that vaccination timings be extended further from 7pm to 11pm due to the holy month of Ramzaan,” said Shaikh. Congress corporator Ravi Raja said he has identified a school in Sion Koliwada. “But then, the administration should be assured of adequate stocks. There is no point in starting a centre just for the sake of it. If adequate vaccine stocks keep coming, we will also be able to wrap up the drive faster for our ward residents,” he said. Meanwhile, civic officials said they plan to set up help desks in slums where citizens may find it inconvenient to register themselves. The need to focus on slums also comes in the wake of the recent sero survey pointing out how antibodies in slum pockets have reduced to 41.6%. The first sero survey last July showed 57% of the population in slums had antibodies. This reduced to 45% in the second survey conducted in August 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-plans-227-centres-in-corporator-wards-to-vaccinate-all-aged-above-18/articleshow/82299128.cms||Richa Pinto

Police suspect the fire broke out during cooking of food. The deceased were identified as Dolly Kumari (12), Rakhi Kumari (8), Arti Kumari (6) and their youngest brother Amit Kumar (4). Their house was made of straws, plastic sheets, plywood and other temporary items beside the Patna-Gaya railway line. “Some of the villagers told the police that the house was locked from outside as the parents didn’t wish the children to venture out amid the Covid-19 pandemic. This was one reason that the children were unable to run out to safety after the fire broke out inside the house,” Punpun police station SHO Kundan Kumar Singh said. “The couple had five children. They had gone to the nearby fields with one of their daughters early in the morning for harvesting. The other four children stayed behind,” the SHO said. CM Nitish Kumar condoled the deaths and and ordered immediate ex gratia payment of Rs4 lakh to the next of the kin of the deceased. SHO Singh said the deceased were children of Chotu Paswan and Laxmi Devi. Singh said few of the villagers spotted thick black smoke emanating from the house around 9am and rushed there but in vain. “Police and firefighters were informed. The fire was doused within half an hour but till then the four children were charred to death,” he said, adding none of the villagers heard screams of any of the siblings. The SHO said all the four bodies were sent to Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) for postmortem after which they would be handed over to the parents. “The grieving parents are yet to be quizzed in this connection,” he said. The SHO said Masaurhi SDO Sanjay Kumar, SDPO Sonu Kumar Rai besides block development officer and circle officer had also reached the spot. “One cheque for Rs4 lakh has already been handed over to the family. Civil authorities said the rest Rs12 lakh of the ex gratia amount would also be paid to them soon,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/4-siblings-charred-to-death-as-house-catches-fire-in-punpun/articleshow/82298060.cms||Debashish Karmakar

---||Allahabad||Eight medical staff test positive, reducing number of RRTs from 96 to 88||Prayagraj: At least eight medical staff who are part of the Rapid Response Teamss (RRTs) tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday, reducing the number of RRTs in the city from 96 to 88. In order to ensure proper treatment, care and adequate quarantine arrangements for the many Covid patients isolating in their respective homes, the district health department has formed a total of 96 RRTs. The permission for home isolation is granted only after the RRTs inspect the home of a patient and approve of the facilities, including the presence of a caregiver and decent living conditions. However, after eight medical and para medical staff tested positive, there are 88 RRTs operating in the city currently. Statistics of the health department revealed that as many as 50,356 patients had applied/been permitted for home isolation since the outbreak of the disease, and 41,766 of them have completed the period of home isolation. Currently, over 9,000 patients are under home isolation facility. Senior medical officer and nodal officer (RRT), Dr Anupam Dwivedi informed that only asymptomatic patients below 60 years can opt for home isolation if they have the requisite facilities at home and can avoid contact with other family members. On Tuesday (April 27) alone, as many as 1,565 patients completed home isolation. Patients must have a home quarantine kit comprising of a pulse oximeter, thermometer, masks, sterile gloves, sodium hypochlorite and tablets of ashwagandha, giloy and vitamin C. Earlier, there were a medical and a para medical staff in each RRT, but after the health department doubled the strength of RRTs, just one medical officer or a para medica staff visits and inspects the home of a patient to approve the facilities there. Dr Dwivedi, however, admitted, “On an average, over 50-60 per cent of Covid patients without symptoms seek home quarantine facility. Once a patient applies for home isolation, an RRT visits their home for inspection. The team compiles details including patient’s name, age, sex, address, ward number (number of monitoring committees), mobile number and the date when they tested positive. “The RRT also notes if the patient is suffering from cough, cold, breathlessness, high/low blood pressure and oxygen saturation, besides details of any other ailment,” he added.. He, however, made it clear that patients suffering from any other ailments are not eligible for home isolation facility. Officials, meanwhile, said patients should monitor their health regularly and keep the district surveillance officer informed about the latest status.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/eight-medical-staff-test-positive-reducing-number-of-rrts-from-96-to-88/articleshow/82299607.cms||---

---||India||Govt, BJP cite statute to justify polls, junk super-spreader charge||NEW DELHI: The government and BJP have repudiated the suggestion that the dispensation at the Centre contributed to the alarming spread of the Covid-19 pandemic by holding elections to four states and a Union Territory. “Coming from people who have run the affairs of government for decades and are aware of the provisions of the Constitution, this insinuation is a testimony to their bias and the desire to profit from the pandemic,” said a senior minister who underlined that Article 172 of the Constitution made it mandatory to hold polls once the term of an assembly expired. “The Centre had the option of imposing President’s rule in the states and UT where elections were due. But leave aside the attacks that we would have inevitably faced for imposing central rule, this would have not been in consonance with the tenets of democratic accountability which requires a regime to seek a fresh mandate after the completion of its tenure. That is the very essence of democracy,” the minister said. Article 172 of the Constitution says, “Every legislative assembly of every state, unless dissolved sooner, shall continue for five years from the date appointed for its first meeting and no longer and the expiration of the said period of five years shall operate as a dissolution of the assembly, provided that the said period may, while a proclamation of emergency is in operation, be extended by Parliament by law for a period not exceeding one year at a time and not extending in any case beyond a period of six months after the proclamation has ceased to operate.”  A senior BJP leader said emergency was the only situation when the tenure of an assembly could be extended. He and other BJP sources pointed out that the criticism about holding rallies as part of electioneering smacked of “opportunism”. “The quarters which are crying hoarse were applauding when Tejashwi Yadav’s false promise of 10 lakh jobs drew droves to his rallies or when Rahul Gandhi, without wearing a mask, was showing martial arts skills to school students, holding roadshows and jumping from fishing boats. The Left was ecstatic when their ally, Abbas Siddiqui, brought thousands of his supporters to the Brigade Parade ground to mark the launch of the Left-Congress campaign,” the leader said. The Union minister said the critics also celebrated when farmers were holding dharnas on the borders of Delhi and were holding “mahapanchayats just next door to Haridwar”. “The worry about presence of devotees in Haridwar became a matter of genuine concern and so PM Modi appealed to the sants to scale down the celebrations to a token affair. But can you recall a single instance of any opposition leader issuing a similar appeal to the farm leaders?” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-bjp-cite-statute-to-justify-polls-junk-super-spreader-charge/articleshow/82301209.cms||---

The association also demanded that if any nurse gets infected on duty, then the hospital should provide them treatment, food and stay on their own cost. The association also gave a memorandum to the superintendent of the hospital and said the nurses are under pressure while working in Covid wards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nursing-staff-of-jln-hosp-stage-dharna-want-rotation-of-duty/articleshow/82299180.cms||---

However, in a relief to patients, two dedicated health centres became functional in the city later with 70 beds and 50 oxygen cylinders each in Satellite and Panchsheel hospitals. In the last 24 hours, 790 tested positive while two deaths were confirmed by officials. All the 1,400 beds in JLN Hospital are occupied and the 16 private hospitals in the district are also loaded with patients. On Wednesday, five ambulances with patients seen waiting for admission. After an hour’s wait, most of them were referred to Satellite and Panchsheel hospitals. District administration confirmed there was no shortage of oxygen, but sources said the major problem was of beds. An elderly woman, who brought her husband in an ambulance in a critical condition and waited for two hours outside the Covid ward of JLN Hospital said, “No one is hearing as there is no senior doctor here. The number given by administration is not responding. My husband is dying without treatment.” Later, she was asked to take her husband to Satellite hospital. Another relative of a patient waiting in ambulance said there was no one to hear him. Similarly, there was also a long queue for RT-PCR tests in JLN Hospital. They waited in the sun for their turn to get tested and were worried about their condition. Meanwhile, residents of Panchsheel on Wednesday staged a protest over opening of Covid care centre as they fear that the infection would spread in their area. The district administration deployed civil defence workers who will work in three shifts to ensure smooth supply of oxygen cylinders. Earlier, the relatives of the patients were carrying oxygen cylinders from the plant to the ward of the hospital, which TOI reported on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ambulances-with-patients-line-up-outside-ajmer-hosps/articleshow/82299232.cms||---

The police stations were merged in the limits of Pune police on March 23 due to rapid urbanisation and rise in crimes. City police commissioner Amitabh Gupta told TOI on Wednesday, “It has been observed that criminals from rural Pune areas like Shikrapur often travel to Pune and commit crimes. They go back to their native places after committing the crimes. We have opened a makeshift office of the crime branch at Wagholi to check the activities of criminals operating in rural areas.” Gupta said, “We have appointed inspector Ganesh Mane the in-charge of the crime branch (unit VI) and 15 policemen for preventing and detecting crimes in the rural areas under the police stations. We are looking for a spacious place on a rental basis in Wagholi for making the crime branch office fully functional in the days to come.” Additional commissioner of police (crime) Ashok Morale told TOI, “The crime branch officials will play a key role in controlling illegal activities. They will take preventive action against gangs, hardened criminals and focus attention on prevention and detection of crimes and play a key role in collecting criminal intelligence information.” Morale said, “The idea behind opening the crime branch office is to aid in checking criminal activities in the eastern part of the city as the jurisdiction of the two police stations is huge. For instance, the jurisdiction of Lonikand and Loni Kalbhor police stations is 241.69sqkm and 347sqkm, respectively.” “We have provided vehicles to the crime branch and plans are on cards for providing more manpower for meeting various challenges relating to crime and law and order in rural pockets,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/crime-branch-cell-at-wagholi-to-address-cases-from-newly-merged-police-stations/articleshow/82299244.cms||Asseem Shaikh

Sobran Singh (70) had been undergoing treatment for the past five days. The hospital management confirmed that five people, including Kushwah’s father, died due to the unavailability of oxygen. Director of Yashwant Hospital, Dr Surrendra Baghor, said, “Sobran Singh tested Covid-19 positive and was suffering from lung infection. Following difficulty in breathing, he was transferred to the ICU ward. Following unavailability of oxygen, we were not able to save him.” According to health department officials, at least 70 metric tonnes of oxygen a day is required for the 26 designated Covid hospitals in the district but supply is way too less. Senior member of IMA, Agra unit, Dr Ravi Mohan Pachori said, “A majority of the hospitals involved in treating Covid-19 patients are suffering due to paucity of oxygen supply. It will be difficult to save patients in critical condition without oxygen. Machines like BiPAP, HFNC and ventilators have stopped working in several hospitals. The situation is getting worse day by the day.”Chief medical officer of Agra district, Dr RC Pandey, said, “We are making all-out efforts to ensure hospitals do not suffer from oxygen shortage. Supply has not stopped but is much less than the high demand. District administration has ordered that supply to industries be stopped so that hospitals get it. More than 10 teams are working to bridge the gap between supply and demand.” Meanwhile, 696 fresh cases were reported in Agra district on Tuesday, the highest ever. The number of active cases increased to 4,330. The health department reported that 10 Covid-19 patients had died in the past 24 hours. The total number of deaths since March 2020 is 251 now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/bjp-agra-district-prezs-covid-ve-father-dies-due-to-lack-of-o2/articleshow/82297180.cms||---

The deal was brokered by leading real estate consultancy services firm, Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL). Speaking about the Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000- crore-worth project, expected to eventually spread over 150 acres, Narsi Reddy, chairman and managing director of IRA Realty said: “The township will comprise affordable apartments (in the Rs 45 lakh to Rs 50 lakh range), high-end villas (Rs 2.5 crore and above), an international school, hospital and commercial ventures. We have applied for permissions and the project is expected to be rolled out in the next few weeks.” As per plan, the school is set to start operations by the next academic year while the villas are likely to be ready in three years. “We are hopeful that the basic infrastructure will be up and running in 18 months,” Reddy said upholding Shamshabad as the next big realty destination of Hyderabad, after the IT corridor. “It has great infrastructure and is not as expensive as Financial District. We see great potential in area and believe we can create valuations to the tune of Rs 1,000 crore here,” he added. According to Sandip Patnaik, managing director and head, JLL (Telangana and Andhra Pradesh), Shamshabd has not only seen a significant rise in end-customer demand and since 2018 but also piqued the interest of developers owing to its proximity to commercial hubs. “In the past two years, Shamshabad’s residential as well as plot development projects have seen a significant uptake,” he added. According to JLL’s Q1 residential market report, residential sales in Q1 (January to March) 2021 recovered to more than 90% of the volumes witnessed in Q1 of 2020 (pre-Covid) across the top seven cities. Residential market in Hyderabad - particularly the Gachibowli -Manikonda-Kukatpally belt accounted for more than 65% of the sales during the quarter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/soon-a-150-acre-township-project-is-all-set-to-come-up-in-shamshabad/articleshow/82299258.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Thane||Thane: Short-circuit sparks fire in Mumbra hospital, 4 critical patients gasp to death||THANE: The spate of hospital fires continued in the state with four critically ill patients admitted to a private hospital in Mumbra dying early on Wednesday.  The four died gasping for breath while being wheeled out amid dense fumes that engulfed the structure following a short-circuit in the main electric panel, Thane municipal officials said. Just last week, 15 patients had died at the Vijay Vallabh hospital in Virar after a fire broke out there. Twenty non-Covid patients were being treated at the Prime Criticare Hospital in Kausa, including six in the ICU. The patients were pulled out without any burns, but the four who died had possibly inhaled fumes, an official said. Some quick thinking and alertness shown by local residents, a majority of whom were gearing up for sehri, also perhaps helped contain the fatalities and rescue patients who were stuck. Advocate Farhan Ansari (28), who lives close to the hospital, said he rushed out after hearing screams for help and immediately started loosening the iron grilles on the hospital windows to help patients escape as there was massive smoke at the main entrance. ‘Safety norms violated, complaints ignored’Four critically ill patients admitted to a private private hospital in Mumbra died after a fire broke out in the facility early on WednesdayA civic rescue worker said, “The fire was triggered at around 3.40am by a short circuit in the meter room, following which it spread to other areas. There was dense smoke, and our teams had to use special exhaust fans and oxygen masks to enter the premises. While patients in the general ward on Level 1 managed to escape in time, those in the ICU on the ground floor had to be relocated with assistance. A few tried to break the window grilles and escape.” Those who died were Yasmeen Sayed (46), Nawaz Shaikh (47), Halima Salmani (70) and Hari Sonawane (57). An accidental death report has been registered by Mumbra police for now, while a parallel probe will be conducted by municipal officials. Police and rescue teams reached the spot and managed to douse the blaze that was eventually controlled by 9 am along with active participation from locals. A few witnesses said there was a huge blast in the early hours, which woke up many locals. “There was total darkness all around, and soon we could see flames emanating from one corner and engulfing the wooden furniture kept there. There were patients and relatives screaming for help, and in the melee, many didn’t know what to do as they looked for the exit,” said the relative of a patient who had stayed back on Tuesday night. Rescue officials said they evacuated the entire building as a precautionary measure and continued with their rescue operations. Some local residents ensured some oxygen cylinders kept within the premises were instantly removed. A senior fire brigade officer said preliminary investigations revealed short-circuit to be the reason behind the blaze that gutted down the entire ground-plus-one hospital constructed in the seven-storeyed Hasnain Tower building. A few nearby residents said they had complained about the possibility of the hospital violating safety norms in the past, but to no effect. MLA and housing minister Jitendra Awhad, who reached the spot, spoke to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and announced monetary compensation to the kin of the dead. Thane guardian minister Eknath Shinde also visited the facility in the morning along with municipal commissioner Dr Vipin Sharma and announced additional monetary compensation to those affected. “The mishap is unfortunate. I have asked the municipal administration to take prompt steps and undertake fire, structural and oxygen audit of all Thane hospitals to avoid recurrence,” said Shinde. There was brief tension at the spot as BJP leader Kirit Somaiya tried to enter the facility, but local NCP leaders including TMC opposition leader Ashraf Pathan staged a protest against Somaiya, alleging he was politicising the matter. Somaiya had earlier lashed out at the Maha Vikas Aghadi government following three back-to-back mishaps involving hospitals in Thane city. Meanwhile, officials said the healthcare facility had failed to conduct a fire safety audit as mandated by the corporation recently. The bustling suburb of Mumbra has nearly 50 small and medium-sized nursing homes and hospitals, but most of them seem to have failed to get the mandatory safety clearances, leading to such disasters, activists said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-safety-norms-violated-complaints-ignored/articleshow/82299299.cms||Manoj Badgeri

The duo Vishal Karpate (21) and Vicky Bhurgate (25) from Handewadi road had hired the auto from the railway station for reaching Sasanenagar in Hadapsar. The driver, Kunal Agarwal (21) in his FIR said, “The suspects stopped the vehicle at Alankar theatre momentarily to pick up the keys of the motorcycle. The autorickshaw passed via Koregaon Park and reached Mundhwa when one of the suspects asked to stop the vehicle.” “After getting down from the vehicle, the duo abused and thrashed Agarwal and tried to rob him of cash and his cellphone, but he resisted them. The suspects then pushed him aside and sped away robbing his vehicle. Agarwal shared the information of the incident with the city police control room soon after the incident,” Senior inspector Yashwant Gawari said. Gawari said, “A police patrol rushed to the spot and tried to trace the vehicle but in vain. However, Agarwal could recall the registration number of the motorcycle of which the suspects had picked up the keys. He shared that number with the police. With that piece of information, we traced the address and arrested them.” Gawari added that the suspects are first-time offenders and hired the auto with an intention to commit robbery. An FIR relating to the robbery was registered under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/duo-held-for-robbing-auto-driver-of-his-vehicle/articleshow/82299262.cms||---

Different varieties of flowers and fragrant roses have, of late, been budding and blooming in the government botanical and rose gardens in Ooty, which usually draws a large number of tourists in April and May, one of the peak tourism seasons in the hill retreat. As in the past year, this time too there aren’t any tourists to enjoy the enchanting beauty of the major gardens, which are in full bloom, in the hill town, as the government has closed the Nilgiris for tourism activities in the wake of the recent sprout in Covid-19 cases. While the flower show committee had last year announced the dates for the annual flower and other shows in the Nilgiris as part of the summer festival, they were cancelled to contain the contagion. This year, the flower show committee did not convene a meeting, which was supposed to be held in February. The botanical garden won’t be hosting the annual flower show for the second consecutive year since its introduction more than a century ago. Shiva Subramaniam Samraj, joint director, horticulture department, said, “Unfortunately, this year too we could not conduct the flower show. The gardens are, however, being maintained as usual. The summer blooms have started and the gardens are filled with colourful and fragrant flowers.” The botanical garden hoses more than two lakh flower plants of 176 varieties, while the rose garden, one of finest in Asia, has more than 40,000 plants of 4,200 varieties. The rose garden is spread across four hectares. The botanical garden is also home to more than 680 rare botanical species, of which 340 are rare trees that are more than 100 years old.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/in-full-bloom-but-ooty-gardens-miss-crowd/articleshow/82298149.cms||---

Haryana government has given an indent for 66 lakh doses, which include 40 lakh doses of Covishield and 26 lakh doses of Covaxin. Since, the allocation has to be done by Government of India, the government is keeping the fingers crossed over the arrival of stocks for this category. “We have made all arrangements related to preparation at session sites. We are making all out efforts to get an allocation as well as stocks of vaccine before deadline. Since other states too have made the indent and the allocation will be done by the central government, lets see how it works out,” said Rajeev Arora, ACS health, Haryana. “Despite surge in Covid cases, we had been comfortably maintaining the pace in vaccination,” he added. Till Tuesday, Haryana’s vaccination count had reached 37,02,098, which was more than Punjab, Himachal and New Delhi.

---||Aurangabad||Patient dies while shifting at GMCH||Aurangabad: A 40-year-old patient died in the ambulance while he was being shifted from Government Medical College and Hospital’s casualty building to the super-specialty building on the same premises on Tuesday night. The deceased was identified as Sunil Magre, a Dalit activist and resident of Bapunagar area of the city. When contacted, his brother, Gautam, blamed the hospital for his brother’s death and demanded action against the guilty. Soon after Magre’s death, the situation became tense for a while on the GMCH premises. His family alleged that an empty oxygen cylinder was attached to the supply pipe while he was being shifted in the ambulance and he died because of that. The incident has been caught on the CCTV camera installed at the entrance of the casualty building. The CCTV footage shows the patient being taken on a stretcher to the ambulance. Soon after he was put into the ambulance, the mobile oxygen cylinder was detached and taken back inside the casualty building due to some issue. Within a couple of minutes, a mobile oxygen cylinder was brought from the casualty building, but that too did not work. Yet another cylinder was brought, but it was too late by then. “The patient was under treatment at another hospital. His oxygen saturation was 75% when he was brought to the GMCH around 8pm on Tuesday . He was made stable in another two hours, but died while being shifted to the dedicated Covid facility at SSB,” hospital superintendent Suresh Harbade told TOI. “While connecting his oxygen mask to the cylinder in the ambulance, there was noise of air leakage and it might have given the impression that the cylinder was empty,” he said. Sachin Nikam, an activist said, “The CCTV footage shows Sunil getting up from the stretcher in the ambulance. However, the staffers first attached his mask to an empty cylinder. That was followed by arranging another oxygen cylinder, but it started leaking. By the time, a third cylinder was brought, he died.” The Begumpura police said that have not received any complaint so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/patient-dies-while-shifting-at-gmch/articleshow/82296447.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Agra||All 4 platforms at Agra’s lone electric crematoriumstop working, kin wait for hours to perform last rites||(Agra): Overheating and too much load caused by continuous burning of the dead has resulted in a major disruption at Agra's only electric crematorium with all the four platforms now being completely non-operational. With a five-fold increase in workload since the Covid surge, this is the second such disruption in a week.There is also despair everywhere. Relatives waiting to perform last rites were forced to wait for hours in the queue due to the snag.Sources said that at least 50 bodies were cremated in the last 24 hours at Tajganj alone while the other major non-electric crematoriums, too, remain fully occupied.“We have four platforms [or furnaces] for electric cremation here. Usually, each process takes around two hours and a furnace is designed to cremate four bodies a day. But, following the surge for the last two weeks, the platforms have been operating beyond full capacity - for over 20 hours daily," Sunil Vikal, senior member of Shree Kshetra Bajaj Committee, a social organisation which manages the Tajganj crematorium said.Now, at least 15 bodies are being cremated on each platform per day, he added.To speed up the cremation process, the iron platforms had to be operated at 800 degree Celsius instead of the usual 600 degrees. "Overheating due to non-stop burning of bodies has caused the melting of the external parts of the platform. So, all the four platforms stopped working on Wednesday," Vikal further said.Tajganj crematorium in-charge Sanjeev Kumar Gupta said, “We are trying to make the platforms operational soon. Mechanics are not available. So, we are trying to replace the damaged parts locally. All the four platforms should be back in the next 48 hours." Caretakers at the crematorium said the number of bodies arriving here has jumped five-fold in the last two weeks. Since Tuesday evening, 75 bodies have been consigned to flames with woods. Earlier, 15 bodies used to be cremated per day on an average, they pointed out. Meanwhile, chief medical officer (CMO) of Agra district Dr RC Pandey said, “In 24 hours, 10 Covid-19 patients have died in Agra district. The huge rush at crematoriums may be due to some other reasons." The CMO didn't spell out the "other reasons" though. Scenes at the crematoriums tell a different story. With barely any space to stand, families of the deceased are not allowed to even wait inside the compound.“My father was having breathing difficulties two days ago. We failed to get a hospital bed for him. He died at home today. Now, we are waiting for his last rites for over two hours. There is no vacant space. So, we have been told to wait for another 3-4 hours," Anil Goyal, a Pratapura resident, said.As per the ritual, cremations are usually avoided after sunset. But for the last three days, the bodies are being cremated right through the night, a local said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/all-4-platforms-at-agras-lone-electric-crematoriumstop-working-kin-wait-for-hours-to-perform-last-rites/articleshow/82297199.cms||Deepak Lavania

---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: 48 remdesivir vials stolen from Aurangabad facility||AURANGABAD: Amidst reports of remdesivir injections being black marketed, 48 vials of the vital drug were found to be stolen from a civic body-run dedicated Covid hospital on the premises of the Meltron company at MIDC Chikalthana in Aurangabad city. Taking serious cognizance of the same, civic body administrator Astik Kumar Pandey has issued a show-cause notice to five civic body employees asking them to respond within 24 hours. The employees have been warned that if they fail to come clean on the matter, they would face police action. Aurangabad Municipal Corporation’s health officer Dr Neeta Padalkar said the civic body had supplied 26 boxes — comprising 48 vials of remdesivir each — to the Meltron facility on April 20. In addition, there were 14 loose vials in another box. This means, on April 20, the Meltron facility have a total of 1,262 vials of remdesivir. On April, 23, the pharmacist deployed at Meltron found that one of the boxes had vials of some other drug intead of remdesivir. He immediately raised an alert with the Covid control room. Not taking any chance, the civic body contacted the drug manufacturer to check if it had, by mistake, sent some other vials. However, the manufacturer said there was no error at its end. There was then a preliminary inquiry by a medical officer. Subsequently, five employees were issued the show-cause notices. Padalkar said that out of the 10,000 remdesivir vials directly procured by the civic body from the manufacturer, 2,000 each were given on loan to the Government Medical College and Hospital and private hospitals through the district collector’s office. The remaining 6, 000 were kept in the store room, especially for the critical patients getting admitted to the Meltron facility. Sources said instructions have been issued to check the CCTV footage of the store room. Moreover, the record of the injections utilised at the facility is also being analysed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/48-remdesivir-vials-stolen-from-aurangabad-facility/articleshow/82296451.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Coimbatore||Staff shortage in MCH hits Covid-19 patients badly||Coimbatore: The Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) is battling manpower shortage amid the rising cases of Covid-19. It has obviously added to the woes of patients, who don’t get timely care often.K Thangaraja, a resident of Gandhi Managar, recalled his harrowing experience. “I came to CMCH with severe headache and fever on Tuesday after I tested positive for the virus. I had to, however, wait for more than an hour to get a bed.”This wasn’t because of the acute shortage of beds in the hospital, but owing to the lack of sufficient manpower. There are just four nurses to handle the entire job of registering Covid-19 patients, verifying their medical certificates, checking availability of beds and allotting them, and nursing the patients in the special wards.Thangaraja, a father of two, said, “It is not that nurses are hesitant to deliver their duties. It looks like their workload is enormous and hence patients are forced to wait longer even to get a bed. Patients are left on their own to get medicines and CT scan.”At least 514 of the 1,045 beds at the CMCH were occupied on Wednesday.Another patient, Subash, said he was asked to take a CT scan and there wasn’t anyone to guide him to the lab or about the payment. “I had no other option but to ask other petitions and helpers. All the staff at the Covid-19 ward seemed to be extremely busy and I felt sorry to disturb them.”Another patient had an entirely different bitter experience. He was taken to the ESI Hospital in a government ambulance after he tested positive for the infection. “I was referred to the CMCH since I had comorbidities and denied ambulance service. At CMCH, I had to wait another one hour to get a bed.”Pointing out that it was a private agency that was serving them food in the hospital that too only to those in its list, he said nurses would take at least a day to register the patients’ name in the list. “As a result, patients have to arrange their own food on the first day of hospitalization. How will the patients, who are without attenders, will arrange the same?” He said the doctors would visit them only twice a day - in the morning and evening. “If we want to report any discomfort, we will have to approach the nurses on the ground floor and they would ask us to wait for the doctor’s visit.” A nurse, who didn’t want to be identified, said they were short-staffed. “Only 65 of us are working in three shifts in the Covid-19 ward that has about 520 patients. It’s difficult for us to manage. We have communicated our struggles to the management, but to no avail. We are exhausted and stressed out because of the workload.”A senior official with the hospital, meanwhile, said they were taking all the necessary steps to tackle the situation. “We have recommended the state government to increase the manpower. We have also approached private nursing colleges to send their graduates to the hospital for the time being. But none of them have paid heed to our request so far.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/staff-shortage-in-mch-hits-covid-19-patients-badly/articleshow/82298196.cms||Nivedha Selvam

The industry representatives in the state said if the proposals go unchallenged and get implemented, the gem and jewellery industry will have a crippling impact as the US has proposed to levy tariffs up to 25% on the products. “We are readying plans to challenge the proposals in the in the US courts and are also writing to the Centre to address the issue,” said Rajeev Jain, former chairman of Gem and Jewellery Exports Promotion Council. He said many products made or processed in Rajasthan like semiprecious stones, silver jewellery, gold necklaces, and base metal chains clad with gold are mentioned in the list. “If this happens, the whole business will shift to Hong Kong and we have to close our export business because the US accounts for 25% of the direct shipments. Besides, a huge volume is routed through the US to other global markets,” added Jain. Last year, India levied an equalisation tax on ecommerce companies that have no physical operation in the country. The 2% digital service tax (DST) on purchases through these companies came into effect from April 2020. The Indian government is currently examining the USTR proposals and may knock the doors of the WTO if it is levied. The USTR list includes other products like shrimps, basmati rice, bamboo items, wood furniture, and cigarette paper, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gem-jewellery-industry-frets-over-new-tax-by-us-on-exports/articleshow/82299293.cms||---
---||Goa||As cases surge, FC Goa foreign players, coach leave for home||Panaji: With Covid-19 cases on a rapid rise, FC Goa’s coach and foreign players have all left for home on Wednesday in the middle of the high-profile AFC Champions League over fears that any more delay could mean they will be locked down in India. The foreign contingent includes captain Edu Bedia, Jorge Ortiz and Ivan Gonzalez, besides coach Juan Ferrando and conditioning coach Javi Gonzalez—all from Spain. Australian defender James Donachie is also on the flight from Delhi to Madrid via Paris on Wednesday. Goa still have one match left to be played in the AFC Champions League against Al Wahda on Thursday. “If they don’t make it to Spain tonight, they may get stuck here for another month. Spain will impose a mandatory quarantine for everyone travelling from India. There could be a travel ban too, besides we don’t know about restrictions or a lockdown here. It made sense for them to leave immediately,” a club official told TOI. “We cannot fault the players (for leaving early). They gave everything to this club and were professional in every sense,” said the official. Goa will now field an all-Indian squad against second-placed Al Wahda on Thursday. Seriton Fernandes is expected to captain the team. Goa have done well on debut in the AFC Champions League, Asian football’s premier club competition, with three points from their first five matches. They started with draws against Al Rayyan (Qatar) and Al Wahda (UAE), before two consecutive losses against Iranian champions Persepolis FC. Goa almost registered a historic win against Al Rayyan, before conceding a last-minute equaliser in the previous game.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-cases-surge-fc-goa-foreign-players-coach-leave-for-home/articleshow/82300423.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Police identified the deceased motorcyclist as Abhishekh Kishor Kadam (25) of Anandnagar on Sinhagad Road. “The identity of the deceased pedestrian is being ascertained,” said senior inspector Jagannath Kalaskar of the Bharati Vidyapeeth police on Wednesday. “Rahul Bhagwat Bawangave (25) of Dhankawdi, the injured pillion rider, is undergoing treatment at a hospital. He narrated on Wednesday afternoon how the accident occurred. We have also found a CCTV footage of the accident from a camera placed inside the tunnel,” Kalaskar said. “Bawangave is a civil engineer and works as a supervisor at a construction site in the Ambegaon area. Kadam was also a civil engineer and worked at a construction site at Ganesh Peth. Both were classmates since their school days. They had left their homes on Tuesday morning and went to the construction sites. They had informed their parents that they would be coming home late in the evening,” he said.  “Kadam and Bawangave met each other around 3.30pm on Tuesday and then they went to Khed-Shivapur for some work. They stayed there till late evening. Then they went to the Navale bridge area from Khed-Shivapur, took a U-turn and crossed the tunnel. They again took a U-turn towards Pune city from Khed-Shivapur and reached the tunnel when the accident occurred,” Kalaskar said. “The CCTV footage shows the motorcycle riders collided against the pedestrian walking towards the Sinhagad Road area at a high speed. The deceased motorcyclist and the pedestrian flung into the air and fell on the road surface,” he said. The other deceased man, around 35-year-old, was wearing a lungi and a shirt, the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/biker-pedestrian-killed-in-accident-at-new-katraj-tunnel-pillion-rider-injured/articleshow/82299317.cms||---
---||Delhi||Covid testing is down by nearly 27% in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Daily testing for Covid-19 in Delhi has reduced by nearly 27% over the past two weeks. This, even as the positivity rate is around 32%, meaning every third person getting tested in the city is turning positive. On Wednesday, Delhi recorded 25,986 new cases and 368 fresh fatalities. The new cases came out of 81,829 tests, including 55,702 RT-PCR and 26,127 rapid antigen tests (RAT). The data shared by the health department shows Delhi recorded maximum 1.14 lakh Covid-19 tests in a day on April 11. Since then, the count has been below the one-lakh mark. TimesViewData doesn’t lie. It just shows the mirror. Reducing test doesn’t help control Covid-19. Rather, it creates a false sense of security. Playing blind is dangerous when so many lives are at stake.The average number of tests conducted over the past two weeks has also reduced. In the second week of April, Delhi conducted an average of 99,460 tests daily. In the third and fourth weeks, it reduced to 76,195 and 73,027, respectively. “The reduction in testing at a time when the Covid-19 outbreak is at its peak is wrong. We should be conducting more tests to ensure timely diagnosis, isolation and treatment,” doctors say. But Suman Kumar, a resident of Green Park, said, “I have been trying all labs to book home collection for two days but there is no response. Most of the labs and hospitals aren’t even taking calls.” There are two main types of tests for Covid-19. RT-PCR, which detects the presence of infection by targeting specific genetic sequences of SARS CoV2, the virus that causes Covid-19, has 68% to 80% sensitivity — ability to correctly identify the infection. The second is RAT that detects the presence of infection by targeting specific viral proteins present in the patient sample. Though RAT gives results faster, it throws up a high rate of false negative results. RT-PCR testing is available for free at government hospitals while private labs charge Rs 800 and an additional Rs 400 for home collection. In the past few weeks, there have been multiple complaints of private labs refusing home collection due to unavailability of staff or results being delayed. The labs say this is because they are overburdened.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-testing-is-down-by-nearly-27-in-city/articleshow/82299320.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa CM Pramod Sawant declares ‘lockdown’, but leaves most businesses open||PANAJI: The state government on Wednesday issued an order tightening the existing curbs to “help break the chain” and control the exponential spike in Covid-19 cases in the state. Although chief minister Pramod Sawant had on Wednesday afternoon announced a four-day “lockdown” from April 29 to May 3, in the evening, the two district collectors issued a ‘lockdown’ order, which was contradictory to Sawant’s announcement that other than essential services, life in Goa would come to a standstill. He also stated that the weekend lockdown was to “help break the chain of the virus’ spread”. “There is no need to panic. All essential services will be on. Life will normalise from Monday morning. The markets will be shut as crowding at weekly markets is being witnessed. All services classified by the government as essential services will be on. Casinos will be shut. Public transport will be shut. Pharmacies will be open,” Sawant said. However, as per the orders issued by the North and South Goa collectors, from 9pm on April 29 to 6am on May 3, except for banning of public gatherings and shutting of casinos and bars, all other economic activity will continue. With all shops and establishments also permitted to remain operational up to 9pm, the order has effectively only advanced the night curfew by an hour, which will now be extended up to May 3. Except for a few additions, similar restrictions were already in place, and the ongoing night curfew, from 10pm onwards, was to be in force up to April 30. The order allows restaurants to operate at 50% capacity from 6am to 9pm, and only provide food delivery services during the remaining hours. “Fish market and municipal/panchayat market will be allowed to function only with proper arrangements for enforcement of Covid appropriate behaviour, like social distancing, use of masks, etc,” the North and South Goa collectors’ orders stated. “If everyone remains indoors during these four days and do not come out in large numbers, then it will be a big favour to all of us. We will be able to break the chain,” chief minister Pramod Sawant said, while adding that there is no likelihood of the four-day restrictions being extended. Sawant said that containment zones will be announced in areas such as Porvorim, Candolim and Margao where the number of Covid-19 cases are high. “These orders may be for longer periods, as required. But even in these areas grocery stores will be open. This will be limited to specific areas. The collectors concerned will issue the orders. There is no need to panic. Labourers should not panic and leave the state,” said Sawant. The announcement of a ‘lockdown’ nevertheless created panic among migrant workers, who were seen lining up to catch the first train out of Goa the same evening. Marriages, which are already scheduled to take place during the four-day lockdown period, can take place with the earlier set guest limit of 50 persons, Sawant said. “We have not kept any window for grocery and essential item shops to be on as this can lead to a rush during the specified time, so the stores will run as usual. Industrial activities can continue within their own premises,” Sawant said. Those who have scheduled vaccination appointments will be able to go ahead with their jabs, as planned. “Taking into consideration the various industries, we have taken the middle path,” said Sawant about the limited days of lockdown announced. He said tourists, who have already booked hotel rooms, will be able to stay at the place booked by them. “They will have to remain inside their booked room. They will not be able to roam outside,” said Sawant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-sawant-declares-lockdown-but-leaves-most-businesses-open/articleshow/82300460.cms||---

In some cases, the hosts are also sending breakfast, lunch, dinner for three days to their relatives. The ritual of singing songs for 26-year-old bride Sapana of Ayodhya Path, Mansarowar, ahead of the wedding on April 30, began online on Tuesday evening with the online participation of around 85 members of the extended family from Udaipur, Banswara, Kota, Bundi and Delhi. “We are currently hosting around 100 guests online at their own respective places for three days with three meals daily and a massive dinner on wedding night when the number of guests is expected to go up nearly 300,” said Krishan Bhadur, uncle of Sapana, who is in-charge of organising all the events. Bhadur said he was happy to bring together all the relatives online for the ceremony. “Decked up in the best attire for the occasion, all family members actively attended the online ritual of mahila sangeet in Indore from our home here,” said Garima, whose cousin’s wedding is on April 29. There are around seven auspicious dates for wedding as per Hindu tradition on concluding two days of the ongoing month and next month, most auspicious of them being on Akha Teej or Akshya Tritya on May 14, when a large number of marriages are performed across Rajasthan, particularly in the rural belt, said Pandit Manish Kumar Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/kin-attend-wedding-functions-online-in-kota/articleshow/82299307.cms||---
---||Goa||In a first, Goa posts over 3,000 cases in a day||PANAJI: The state recorded another grim high of 3,101 fresh infections on Wednesday, by far the highest single-day spike so far. The number of active cases rose to a staggering 18,828, putting immense load on the state’s already crumbling healthcare infrastructure. With 24 deaths, the state’s toll rose to 1,111. It was a chaotic scene at most of the state’s hospitals, as the deluge of patients far outnumbered the available beds. Goa Medical College (GMC) dean Dr S M Bandekar said that the hospital sees 60-70 admissions a day, and that on Tuesday, over 50 patients were on trolleys as there were no beds. “We shift them on beds as and when they become available, or transfer them to another hospital, depending on the case,” he said. In hospitals across the state, patients had to wait for hours whether for testing or any other service, as most establishments saw Covid-19 cases increase drastically over the past few days. “As I see it, things have spiralled out of control,” said Sunil Borkar from Usgao. He had been visiting his nephew at GMC’s pediatric ward, and tested positive. “It is depressing to see the plight of people and the overworked doctors and other staff.” Borkar said that patients were pleading with doctors to save them. “Despite the presence of security, it is not easy to maintain social distancing at GMC,” he said. “I saw a doctor asking a patient’s relatives to leave the premises immediately lest they also be infected.” he said. “I would tell them the same, even if my brother came here. Please leave, the doctor told them,” he said. Although hospital authorities made it clear that not more than one patient attendant would be allowed, inevitably, many of the patient’s relatives and well-wishers visit the hospital, leading to difficulties in maintaining social distancing. “Visit the hospital pharmacies and you will see how people crowd without bothering to maintain social distance,” he said. “The same scenario is seen in canteens. People behave very irresponsibly.” Meanwhile, urban development minister Milind Naik tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday. Last week, he was busy with the municipal election campaign, and on Monday, after the results, his workers visited him after the victory of his panel. Of the 24 deaths reported on Wednesday, 12 died at the South Goa district hospital, eleven at GMC, and one at a private hospital in South Goa. A 35-year-old woman from Aquem was the youngest among the deceased. She was obese and tested positive a day before she was taken to South Goa district hospital on Tuesday, and diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Margao’s active tally surged past the 1,800-mark, while Candolim’s was 1,436 and Porvorim’s 1,291. The state’s recovery rate dropped to 76%, and 839 people were cured in the past 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-a-first-goa-posts-over-3k-cases-in-a-day/articleshow/82300472.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Khattar govt restricts sale of antiviral drugs to Covid hosps||Chandigarh: The Haryana government on Wednesday restricted the sale and distribution of experimental injectable drugs Remdesivir and Tociluzimab to stop their indiscriminate use in case of Covid-19. A spokesperson of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) had approved the restricted emergency use of Remdesivir injectable formulations for the treatment of severe Covid-19 infection. Remdesivir can be sold only under the prescription of medical specialists and supplied for use only to the hospitals for correct application. In the second wave of the pandemic, doctors were prescribing the Remdesivir injection indiscriminately, even though the Drugs Controller General of India had approved it as an emergency drug for the ICU patients on ventilator support. Doctors should not prescribe it for the patients who are under home isolation, outside ICU, off ventilator, or not in serious enough condition to need this medicine. Irregular sale of Remdesivir and Tociluzimab is punishable under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. The seller might lose drug licence. Its black marketing and hoarding are also cognizable and punishable offences. Since the drugs are for the management of very critical Covid cases, their misuse is counted as violation under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), Epidemic Act, and Disaster Management Act. The drug sellers have orders to comply with the Drugs and Drugs Price Control Order (DPCO) read with the Essential Commodities Act. They must also follow the purchase and distribution rules of the state drugs controller and the FDA. They must restrict the sales to Covid hospitals with ICU beds and critical care facility. They must also keep a record of the Covid report, Aadhaar ID, indoor-patient card and drug record card for inspection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/khattar-govt-restricts-sale-of-antiviral-drugs-to-covid-hosps/articleshow/82299319.cms||---

Speaking to TOI, a nurse, who didn’t want to be named, said the hospital hadn’t increased the number of nursing posts for years and there were only 300 nurses, who were overburdened. “Ideally, the government should increase the number of nursing posts in tandem with the rise in the number of beds in a hospital. But the posts were not increased at the CMCH for a long time. While the hospital requires a nursing staff strength of 900, only one-third of them are working. We are forced to work at least 10 hours to 12 hours a day. Sometimes, we have to forgo our weekly offs.” She said as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines, there should be a nurse for every patient in ICU and for every eight patients in general unit. “Now, a nurse takes care of 60 to 80 patients. Covid-19 cases are increasing drastically and the number of Covid patients admitted to CMCH has crossed 500. Our workload has increased manifold. We are tired and are undergoing enormous stress, which is taking a toll on productivity.” The nurse said they were responsible for admitting patients, recording number of vacant and filled beds, injecting vaccines and providing medicines, apart from caring for the patients. “We could not give 100% to patients because of the workload and as a result, we end up facing the wrath of their relatives,” she said. The protesters returned to work after hospital authorities assured to address the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/nurses-stage-token-protest-demand-more-manpower/articleshow/82298235.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The vigilance wing of the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB), led by chief vigilance officer (CVO) M Ravi Chandan Reddy and vigilance inspector P Tirupathi raided properties at two different locations in the city on Wednesday. The first raid was conducted on the premises of Rasheeda Begum at Humayun Nagar. “It was found that the building doesn’t have any permission to have a water connection,” said a release issued by the HMWS&SB on Wednesday. Even as the officials were disconnecting the water connection, Rasheeda’s relative Jahangeer, a history sheeter along with Imtiyaz threatened and obstructed the officials. “Jahangeer and others tried to obstruct the legitimate duties of public servants. They are liable to be punished under section 353 of the IPC. A criminal case was booked at the Saifabad police station against Jahangeer, Rasheeda and Imtiyaz,” said Tirupathi. At a house in Venkat Rami Reddy Nagar in the Medchal-Malkajgiri district a criminal case was booked against Israel, for having an illegal water connection in his building.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/four-booked-for-having-illegal-water-connection/articleshow/82299314.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan banks on assurances by Union ministers on oxygen||JAIPUR: Though the state government termed the visit of three cabinet ministers to Delhi as a success, it got nothing but a few assurances. The ministers sought the help of speaker Om Birla to get an audience with the Union ministers. They were able to meet minister of state for chemicals and fertilizers Mansukh Mandaviya and had a video conference with home minister Amit Shah, health minister Harsh Vardhan, railways minister Piyush Goyal and road transport minister Nitin Gadkari, following Birla’s intervention. The state government which has been accusing the Centre of discrimination and partiality towards the Congress ruled state in the allotment of medical oxygen and vital drugs changed its tactics and sought the help of the Centre as the situation in the state has become worrisome with the case load increasing and hospitals overwhelming with every passing day. According to medical experts, the situation in the coming month might get worse as the peak of the second wave is expected in the second week of May. Without the Centre’s assistance, the state government may face a situation similar to Delhi. With very few friends to the state government in the Modi dispensation, the chief minister had to seek the help of speaker Birla as a pointman. The Union ministers from the state are at loggerheads with the Gehlot government. Union minister Arjunlal Meghwal taking a dig at the state government questioned the rationale of sending ministers to Delhi. The Union ministers, the three cabinet ministers interacted, could give only some assurances on the states demands for more oxygen and cryogenic tankers to transport oxygen. However, the government just hopes that the centre would act on its promises. UDH minister Shanti Dhariwal said, “Speaker Om Birla called all the ministers and officials and asked them to consider the state's demands. We hope that the Indian government will focus on resolving the problems of Rajasthan quickly." The major problem facing the states is the short supply of cryogenic tankers to transport the allotted oxygen. With the centre yet to act on the chief minister's suggestion of taking over the oxygen carriers and allot states according to demand, there is now fierce competition among states to get tankers. After the Delhi government gave an advertisement for the cryogenic tanker owners to contact its nodal officer, the Rajasthan government had also given an advertisement. There is a scramble for oxygen tankers to bring the allotted oxygen to the hospitals struggling to get the system going. Minister B D Kalla said the Railway Minister Piyush Goyal had assured of supply oxygen by railways to Rajasthan from the eastern states. Health minister Raghu Sharma informed that "the Union Ministers have assured us that life-saving medicines like oxygen and Remdesivir will be made available soon in proportion to the consumption. We have full confidence in his assurance. He said that he has also talked to the Ministry of External Affairs to bring oxygen from abroad to Rajasthan.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-banks-on-assurances-by-union-ministers-on-oxygen/articleshow/82299313.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Fauci: Covaxin neutralises Indian mutant Covid strain||Washington: India's indigenous vaccine, Covaxin, got a shot in the arm on Tuesday, with endorsement from a leading western expert. America's leading pandemic expert Dr Anthony Fauci said most recent data from people who received Covaxin found it neutralized the 617 variant of the coronavirus rampaging through India. “This is something we are still gaining data on, but most recent data looking at convalescent sera of COVID-19 cases in people who received Covaxin...it was found to neutralize the 617 variant,” Dr Fauci said at a White House briefing. “So, despite the real difficulty that we’re seeing in India, vaccination could be a very, very important antidote against this virus,” he added. The thumbs-up for Covaxin from Fauci comes after skepticism within India on the domestically produced vaccine, with criticism directed at the urgency with which it was approved for use while still trialing. Developed by Bharat Biotech in partnership with National Institute of Virology and the Indian Council of Medical Research, trial results have showed that Covaxin has an efficacy of 78%, a shade less than what is claimed by Big Pharma in the west. Although some Indian experts had also said Covaxin works against the mutant variant, many analysts believe India's best bet is a domestically produced vaccine rather than wait for imports. Separately, Dr Fauci also implicitly criticised wealthy nations for their failure to tackle the global nature of the pandemic, leading to situations like the one in India. “The only way that you’re going to adequately respond to a global pandemic is by having a global response, and a global response means equity throughout the world,” Fauci told the Guardian Australia, amid widespread criticism of western nations for cornering supply of vaccines and sitting on excess stockpiles. “Right now, it’s a terrible tragic situation where people are dying because there’s not enough oxygen, where there’s not enough hospital beds. We have to try, looking forward, to get as much equity when it comes to public health issues as we possibly can,” Fauci said, adding, “there are responsibilities that countries have to each other, particularly if you’re a wealthy country and you’re dealing with countries that don’t have the resources or capabilities that you have.” Fauci said the US has “really revved up” in helping out India, lining up oxygen, remdesivir, personal protective equipment, and a variety of other medications followed by vaccines. The Biden administration is awaiting FDA clearance before exporting the 60 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine, including to India should New Delhi ask for it. India has been pressing for relaxation in export of raw material and intellectual property issues to ramp up its own domestic production.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fauci-covaxin-neutralises-indian-mutant-covid-strain/articleshow/82300518.cms||---

They can spend the amount without taking the consent of the house or the finance and contracts committee (F&CC). The MC house during its first meeting unanimously delegated powers to mayor Amarjit Singh Sidhu alias Jeeti Sidhu to constitute the F&CC members. However, opposition councillors demanded two of their councillors be made members of the committee. Mayor Amarjit Singh Sidhu alias Jeeti Sidhu said, “All these decisions have been taken to get uninterrupted and maximum development done for Mohali residents.

Ghosh was forced to book a flight to Kolkata from Mumbai for April 30 after finding no flying option from Pune due to the total closure of its airport, as announced earlier, because of the runway recarpeting work from April 26 to May 9. “Seven of us are flying from Mumbai to Kolkata. This means I will have to get at least four cabs to reach Mumbai from Pune and this will cost me around Rs11,000. Then I came to know that the runway closure plan has been postponed. I am desperately trying to contact the airline since the past three days to get our flight rescheduled from Pune. If this happens, I can avoid the road travel and also save some money,” Ghosh told TOI. Several airlines have opened bookings for some flights after the runway closure plan was deferred by the IAF. Since then, a large number of people from Pune, who were forced to book flights from Mumbai, have been requesting airlines to reschedule their flights from here. A senior Pune airport official told TOI that at least two airlines had cancelled all their flights from Pune after the runway closure was announced. “There are just 20 flight movements at present. Besides the drop in the number of passengers, the runway closure announcement also forced some airlines to stop their flights. But since IAF has postponed the work, few airlines have opened the booking window for some destinations from Pune. From May 1, we will have more flights. After May 9, flight operations are expected to be back to normal,” the official said. When the summer schedule came into effect from March 30, the airport witnessed over 100 flight movements with direct connections to destinations such as Jabalpur, Goa, Darbhanga, Patna and Prayagraj. But around mid-April, the total flight operations came down to 65-70 and direct connections to all these destinations have stopped. “On April 20, I booked a flight from Mumbai to Lucknow for April 30. I then knew that I would not get any flight from Pune. On Tuesday I was casually going through flight availability. I was surprised to find a direct flight from Pune to Lucknow. Since the airline is same, I have requested them to reschedule my flight to Lucknow. It is a hassle travelling to Mumbai by road because of the current restrictions,” Pune resident Kartik Tiwari said. Nilesh Bhansali, director of Travel Agents Association of Pune, said chances of rescheduling were less. “Airlines generally don’t prefer to do sector rescheduling. But under the current circumstances, passengers can always try the option,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/travellers-seek-flight-rescheduling-after-airport-closure-postponement/articleshow/82299326.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Negligence of hosps to blame for fires, says Experts||Mumbai: As many as 40 lives have been lost directly or indirectly to a hospital fire in Maharashtra in nine months, giving rise to serious fire safety concerns and that of accountability among officials. In many instances, patients were undergoing treatment for Covid and were strapped to a life-support that hindered their chances of getting rescued. Wednesday’s fire in Mumbra was the third to be reported from a medical facility in Thane district. It came less than a week after 15 people being charred to death at Virar’s Vijay Vallabh Hospital. Barely a month ago, Mumbai witnessed a fire in Sunrise Hospital that claimed 10 people, most of them admitted to ICUs and on ventilator support. Surprisingly, fire incidents continue to be reported with the same frequency despite the year starting with one of the biggest tragedies the state has seen—the death of 10 infants at Bhandara district hospital. Ex-chief fire officer Pratap Khargopikar called it unfortunate that inquiry committees and reports filed after every incident only gather dust. “They seldom take strict action like jail sentences or hefty fines as laid down under the Fire Safety Act. Audits often find that maintenance of electrical systems is sub-par, hospitals don’t pay attention to loose wiring, overloading or installing appropriate circuit breakers,” he said, adding such small negligence has led to dozens losing lives. He said despite so many incidents, hospitals are unwilling to spend 15%-20% more to install fire-retardant curtains, bedsheets. However, a forensic analysis after the recent Virar fire showed Covid hospitals could be at a higher risk. According to fire expert Nilesh Ukunde, “Covid hospitals, overloaded with patients, are sitting on a time bomb.” In the fires in the ICUs of a Virar and Nagpur hospital, it was found huge quantities of alcohol, due to excess use of sanitizers over the months, was present in the atmosphere. “In case of an electrical failure, caused due to overuse of various machines, the heat mixed with the cloud of alcohol expands and a pressure wave is generated. This can cause an explosion of sorts and a phenomenon called flashover is followed that engulfs beds within seconds,” said Ukunde, who heads the fire audit team of Nagpur. The curtains are the first to catch fire and should be taken off, he said. Khargopikar agrees and suggests ICUs or hospitals with air handling units must tweak it to 20 air changes per hour (ACPH) as opposed to default setting of 8-12 ACPH. For those without sophisticated air handling units, Ukunde said an immediate measure could be to invest in suction pumps that can be used at least 3 times a day to pull out alcohol from atmosphere. “ICUs do not have proper ventilation and alcohol from sanitizers settles on the ceiling as it’s lighter than air,” added Ukunde.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-negligence-of-hosps-to-blame-for-fires-says-experts/articleshow/82299328.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Delhi||CM takes stock, tells officials to increase ICU, oxygen beds||New Delhi: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday convened a meeting with health department officials on the Covid-19 situation in Delhi and directed them to expedite the process of adding more ICU and oxygen beds for Covid-19 patients in Delhi. “We are noticing that this new strain of coronavirus is quite dangerous and often leads to respiratory and breathing issues. It has become very important to provide beds to every patient who needs oxygen. We have to expedite the process to add more ICU and oxygen beds in the coming weeks,” he said in the meeting where deputy chief minister and nodal minister for Covid-19 management Manish Sisodia, health minister Satyendar Jain, additional chief secretary and health secretary were present, along with other senior health officials. Kejriwal also reviewed the home isolation system of Delhi government and said, “We have to further strengthen our home isolation system. Every patient who is recovering from Covid-19 under home isolation should receive regular calls from Delhi government doctors and an oximeter,” he said. “We have to monitor the daily condition of every patient recovering at home,” he added. Taking to Twitter, Kejriwal said, “Convened a meeting with officials. Discussed the plan to increase oxygen beds in the coming days, and strengthen the home isolation system in Delhi. Please take all precautions and stay safe.” In the last few days, Kejriwal has visited several hospitals to review the preparedness and recently said that 1,200 oxygen beds will be added for Covid-19 patients in the city by May 10. Out of these, a 500 oxygen-bed facility is being established at Ramlila Maidan opposite LNJP hospital and another 500 oxygen-bed centre will be added near GTB hospital on a ground near it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-takes-stock-tells-officials-to-increase-icu-oxygen-beds/articleshow/82299340.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Jaipur||Jaipur Metro frequency cut during curfew hours||JAIPUR: As Jaipur Metro is running on 10% of its expected ridership, the Jaipur Metro Rail Corporation (JMRC) has decided to reduce the frequency during the curfew hours. Amid the rising coronavirus cases in the state, Rajasthan government on Friday announced stricter guidelines for the curfew period during which the shops selling essential commodities shall remain open only for four hours, from 6am to 11am. At the same time, the state government has allowed the metro to operate between 6.20am to 5.30pm between Mansarovar and Badi Chaupar corridor. An official said, “Decision has been taken to reduce the train frequency. A train will arrive every 10 minutes between between 6.20am to 11am and after 11am, a train will arrive every 20 minutes.” Before the Covid-induced curfew, the average daily passenger journeys covered on the Jaipur Metro were nearly 30,000, which have plummeted to about 3,000 at present. With minimal income from ridership in last two years, the Jaipur Metro has become a big loss-making entity. The source further said, “Approximately, Jaipur Metro consumes electricity worth Rs 2.5 lakh in a day, of which, units worth Rs 50,000 are produced on its own. As per previous assessments, JMRC faces Rs 41 crore annual loss, if it runs on 60% ridership. The amount will rise up to Rs 71 crore a year if the loss is calculated at 20% ridership. At present, the ridership is negligible, but nothing can be done in these difficult times.” Unlike other state Metros, maximum share of operational losses of Jaipur Metro are being borne by residents since state government is raising money for Rajasthan Transport Infrastructure Development Fund (RTIDF) by levying cess on several services. After RTIDF fund was increased to 15%, JMRC was approximately receiving Rs 42 crore and the gap of deficit amount (operational losses and earning) was covered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaipur-metro-frequency-cut-during-curfew-hours/articleshow/82299323.cms||---

However, based on the available data with the India meteorological department (IMD), the comparison of cumulative rainfall of March and April over a span of 21 years, speaks otherwise. “Pre-monsoon showers are a regular affair over Goa. This year, till now, Goa hasn’t seen any unseasonal or unprecedented rainfall in March and April,” IMD scientist, Rahul M said. However, the state has received higher than normal rainfall this year in March and April – with the normal value being a minimal of 9mm rainfall. “Though the rainfall has been higher than that, it is still not unprecedented rainfall. In fact, even in 2015, March and April were rainier,” Rahul said. Goa has received a total of 29 millimeters of rainfall in these months of 2021 compared to 30mm in 2011 and 52mm in 2015.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/march-april-rain-above-normal-imd/articleshow/82417806.cms||---

In the first executive council meeting of the trust, additional chief secretary, mines and petroleum, Subodh Agarwal said the money collected for the trust will be utilised for the exploration which in the first phase will be undertaken in districts like Kota, Baran, Jodhpur, Bhilwara, Jhunjhunu, Udaipur and Ajmer. He said that because of lack of modern drilling machines only about 2,500 metre drilling is possible today, which is very less. The trust can hire or buy new machines to expedite the exploration work, he added. In its report on March 21, TOI had drawn attention to the fact that even after six months have passed since the creation of the trust, it remained non-functional as funds collected for the trust were not released to it by the government. Under the rules of the trust, all the mining and quarry lease holders are required to pay 2% of the royalty they pay to the state government. The corpus will be used by the trust to carry out its activities. The trust is modelled after the National Mineral Exploration Trust which also gets a contribution from the major mineral lease holders to undertake exploration work in the country. The executive council members include representatives from Mining Exploration Corporation Ltd, Geological Survey of India and Department of Geology and Mines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mineral-exploration-trust-to-undertake-five-projects/articleshow/82299338.cms||---

Dismissed IPS officer Pankaj Choudhary had challenged Kailash’s election and rejection of his nomination by the returning officer as a candidate of BSP from the same constituency. While rejecting the petition, Justice Arun Bhansali said that it could not be ruled in the light of facts that the returning officer rejected his nomination wrongly. It may be noted that his nomination has been rejected on April 10, 2019 on the ground that he had not submitted essential documents required under sections 9 and 33 (3) of the Representation of the People Act 1951. Section 9 of the Act says, “A person who having held an office under the Government of India or under the Government of any State has been dismissed for corruption or for disloyalty to the State shall be disqualified for a period of five years from the date of such dismissal.” While section 33 (3) states that if such person submits a certificate from Election Commission that he has not been dismissed on the abovementioned ground(s) and his dismissal has not completed five years, is eligible for filing nomination. Arguing on petitioner’s behalf, counsel Rajak Haider said that Choudhary had been dismissed on the ground of a family matter and not for corruption or disloyalty to the state. “Inspite of this, the election commission did not issue him the certificate and in absence of the same, his nomination was rejected,” Haider argued. Raising question on the role of election commission for not issuing him certificate till the last date of filing nomination on April 8, 2019 despite his having applied for the same on April 1.

---||Thane||Maharashtra: One patient was to be shifted, family of another says he was breadwinner||THANE: Fate appeared to have played a cruel joke on the families of the dead in the Mumbra hospital fire as they were looking forward to their dear ones recovering swiftly and returning home. Halima Salmani (70) was admitted to Prime Criticare hospital on Tuesday and was immediately shifted to the ICU late evening after she complained of uneasiness in the chest. TimesViewThe pandemic has exposed how ill-equipped our hospitals are to handle such disasters. In the recent past, there have been a series of fires, claiming lives across the state. In the Mumbra incident, the victims did not die even of burns; they collapsed when their ventilators were removed while being wheeled out. “My grandmother didn’t want to be shifted and kept telling my sister that she had been getting a weird feeling since evening. My sister tried to pacify her by making her listen to her favourite ghazals till late in the night, and we also video-chatted. We didn’t think in our wildest dreams that it would be our last chat,” said her grand-daughter. One of the victims, Hari Sonawane (57), a retired MTNL clerk, was to return to his hometown in Ahmednagar after getting discharge, but he tested positive for Covid and was to be shifted to a special facility on Wednesday. “He tested negative in the antigen test but showed positive after a repeat test. We got his reports late on Tuesday and were to shift him on Wednesday, but the fire claimed his life before that,” his son said. Nawaz Shaikh (47) was a physically challenged auto driver and breadwinner of his family. This Khopoli resident was first admitted to a Taloja facility but was later asked to shift to the Mumbra hospital four days ago. “We have no words to express our grief as we were expecting his health to improve and for him to return home soon,” said his brother-in-law. The brother of Yasmeen Sayed (46), another victim, said the Eid celebrations this year had brought back fond memories of their childhood. “We had a strong bond as siblings and used to celebrate Eid with fanfare. I was staying at the hospital till sehri daily, and it was only yesterday I left home at 2 am. I had barely reached home when I heard of the fire, and I rushed back, but we had lost her,” the brother said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-one-patient-was-to-be-shifted-family-of-another-says-he-was-breadwinner/articleshow/82299360.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Sewage plant makes way for highrises||Mumbai: A sewage treatment plant (STP) in Kandivli (E) is making way for a residential complex. The plant spread over 37,000 sq ft is part of the Samata Nagar Mhada layout for low-income group, middle-income group and high-income group families. The complex, which has around 3,000 families, went in for redevelopment in 2007, and the law requires each building to have its own STP so every redeveloped building now treats its own sewage and recycles it. In 2015-16, when the new Development Control Regulations were being drafted, the Maharashtra Housing Area Development Authority (Mhada) asked for the STP plot to be converted into a residential zone. The BMC and state urban development department, last month, approved the change in reservation of the plot. A Mhada official said the STP had been defunct for a long time. “We shall now be able to use the plot to construct more affordable housing,” he added. Sudhir Wakure, department head of S D Corporation that has undertaken the redevelopment of the 165 buildings in the 52 acre layout, said this was the first time that such large integrated redevelopment is being carried out. Around 1,965 flats have already been constructed and 1,750 residents rehabilitated so far, he said. Wakure said 80% of the treated sewage will be recycled and reused by residents, while 20% will be discharged into the BMC’s sewage network. “The layout’s drainage system is being connected to the new sewage disposal network that is being laid across the suburbs.” Environmentalist Debi Goenka, however, pointed out that since it is a large layout, the government should have insisted on a single STP, rather than one for every building. “Residents often do not maintain these plants and are averse to use recycled water. The plot could have been used for secondary and tertiary treatment of sewage water,” he said. Goenka said if all redeveloped and new buildings in Mumbai are to have their own STPs, then the BMC must do away with its plan to set up large STPs in mangroves and wetlands. “One such STP is coming up amongst the lush Malad mangroves,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sewage-plant-makes-way-for-highrises/articleshow/82299344.cms||Clara Lewis

The state is focusing only on Sassoon Hospital for Covid treatment. Civic hospitals are suffering due to non-availability of essential items for treatment. The neglect is leading to a health crisis in Pune,” said Jagdish Mulik, city unit chief of BJP. A party delegation met municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar to discuss the current pandemic situation.“There is a severe shortage of vaccines, oxygen and remdesivir in civic limits. This is happening due to unfair treatment meted out to Pune by the state government,” said Mulik.MP Girish Bapat, who was also present at the meeting, said availability of vaccines, should be a key priority. “People are going to vaccination centers, but they are being sent back as no vaccine is available. A majority of those, who got shots in the first phase of vaccination, were senior citizens. They must get the second dose on time. Micro-planning for it is a must,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bjp-blames-state-govt-for-ignoring-health-crisis-in-city/articleshow/82298311.cms||---

The DRDO said the transfer of MOP technology has been undertaken to Bengaluru-based Tata Advanced Systems Limited and Coimbatore-based Trident Pneumatics. These two companies will set up 380 plants for installation across various hospitals in the country, with at least five such plants coming up in the Delhi-NCR region next month. “The MOPs are designed to generate 1,000 litres of oxygen per minute. The system caters for 190 patients at a flow rate of 5 litres per minute and can charge 195 cylinders per day,” said a DRDO official. “The rest 120 plants of 500 litres per minute capacity will be set up by industries working with the Indian Institute of Petroleum, Dehradun,” he added. The MOP technology, a spin-off of the Tejas developmental programme, is capable of generating oxygen with 93±3% concentration, which can be directly supplied to hospital beds or can be used to fill medical oxygen cylinders.

---||Surat||Tribal lifestyle of safe distancing protects them from Covid: Experts||Surat: The proximity of houses and intermingling of people in small towns and big cities have shot up Covid-19 cases in major parts of the state. However, several tribal pockets in the tribal belt of the state are still protected from the alarming situation despite the lack of medical infrastructure that the cities have.Dang located at the southern tip has the least number of cases in Gujarat at 524, as on Tuesday. Remote pockets in Narmada and Chhota Udepur districts too are not the contributors of the cases in the district. Administrators and social scientists say that several sub-communities within the tribal population have a certain lifestyle wherein they traditionally keep distance from each other.Those from the community living in the hilly terrain and forest areas have their houses and farmlands at a distance from another person’s house and farmland. “Social distancing is automatically observed in Dang district because people here build their houses away from each other and their farmlands are quite apart, so there is little chance of mingling,” said N K Damor district collector of Dang. “In case of Dang, it is hilly and forest region and villages expand over large areas as people live in a segregate way because huts are located at different points,” said professor Kiran Desai of Centre for Social Studies. “However, in the plains of Bardoli, Valod and Vyara, there are groups of tribal who live in a setup which is similar to urban areas,” Desai said. “Those living in hilly terrain have their houses on the top due to which they enjoy privacy and are also able to look after their farmlands on the foothills. We witnessed this last time too, that because of their habitats there is little contact between them which does not allow the spread of the virus,” said Dr Madan Meena, director of Adivasi Academy in Chhota Udepur. Towns like Bodeli, Chhota Udepur and Sankheda in the district are witnessing high numbers of cases while the remote pockets in Naswadi and Kawant are comparatively protected. Meena added that due to self-awareness among the tribal, they have given up social smoking where people used to share beedis. However, the tribal population living in the plains of Tapi district are witnessing a surge in case this time. “The district shares border with Maharashtra so there is lot of commuting between the bordering taluka and Nandurbar. Many people also travel to Surat for work and others from Surat come to our district,” said R J Halani, district collector of Tapi. Halani added that due to the lockdown last year the rural areas in the district had not witnessed high number of cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/tribal-lifestyle-of-safe-distancing-protects-them-from-covid-experts/articleshow/82297285.cms||Jay Pachchigar

But in rare instances of cooperation in India, competitors Bharat Biotech and Indian Immunologicals Ltd (IIL) have turned collaborators for rapid scale-up of capacities for indigenous Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin. IIL will be making the drug substance, a critical component of a vaccine, for Covaxin at its new Karakapatla vaccine facility, which is located just a short drive from Bharat Biotech’s facility in Hyderabad’s Genome Valley. According to sources, IIL will begin making the drug substance for about a couple of million doses of Covaxin from July onwards as part of the two-year tie-up and in the second phase, from November, this will be ramped up to close to 10 million doses. Sources pointed out that such commercial agreements usually take months to hammer out, but were sealed in four weeks flat in this instance keeping in mind the larger national interest of producing as many doses as possible in the face of the surging second wave. Globally, too, Covid-19 has made allies of MNCs such as Sanofi & GSK, who are collaborating on developing a vaccine. More recently Sanofi has agreed to manufacture Moderna's vaccine in US and Merck has agreed to make J&J's vaccines at its facilities in the US. “At a recent high-level meeting helmed by Bharat Biotech Bharat Biotech chairman & managing director Dr Krishna Ella and Indian Immunologicals Ltd managing director Dr K Anand Kumar, both top honchos were very clear that this was of national importance and they should not see any other thing than to come together for the sole purpose of providing vaccines for the country,” said a source with direct knowledge of the matter. “They gave clear instructions to their respective teams to work closely as a team and to keep national interests as priority instead of self-interests,” the source added. IIL, which was using the Karkapatla facility for churning out rabies vaccines, has now decided to ramp up rabies vaccine capacities at another facility in Tamil Nadu and dedicate the Genome Valley facility entirely to Covaxin. IIL MD K Anand Kumar confirmed the company has worked out its capacities in such a manner that its prior commitments for other vaccines like rabies, DPT, pentavalent and Hep-B won’t be compromised by the tie-up. Pointing out that Covid has not just done disastrous things but wonderful things like turning foes into friends, Indian vaccine industry pioneer and Shantha Biotech founder chairman KI Varaprasad Reddy said: “Sanofi and GSK were bigger rivals than these two (IIL and BB) but they are together now. Times have changed. Covid brought them together. The most wonderful thing is two rivals are coming together and making a vaccine against Covid-19.” “The immediate mission is to produce more. So, every company is talking to every other company to produce (Covid-19 vaccine), whether they are friends or foes,” Reddy added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-19-chokes-competition-vax-makers-bb-iil-join-hands/articleshow/82300564.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

---||Goa||Track symptomatic persons, ensure no super spreaders in your area: Pramod Sawant to panchayats||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant has told panchayats to impose whatever restrictions possible within its powers to ensure no crowding takes place in public areas. In a video conference meeting with sarpanchs and other officials on Wednesday, Sawant asked them to get more involved at a personal level with villagers and ensure those with Covid-19 symptoms are tracked and start their medication, even before test results are out. “In a big way, promote in your panchayats the medicines announced to be taken during self-isolation,” said Sawant. “We should promote among people the need to not step out of the house at all. “In many cases, it is seen that those who have tested positive have started roaming out and they have become super spreaders. Issue two warnings to such persons and then we will forcefully send them to Covid care centres with the help of police.” Sawant said medications announced for those under home isolation do not have any side-effects and therefore panchayats have to ensure they are taken by those with symptoms immediately. “In many cases, those who report to hospital die within the first few hours. This is happening because their lungs, it is seen, collapse in this second wave. Therefore, from Day One they should start medication, which have no side-effects. Do not wait for test results. Once your lungs collapse and you are put on a ventilator, it makes recovery difficult,” said Sawant. He told panchayats to get involved at a more personal level with its villages and now each panchayat’s focus should be on making the area under it Covid-19 free. “Do not limit your focus only on sanitisation,” said Sawant. “You should try to ensure that no Covid death takes place in your panchayat. It will depend on how personalised a help you provide at panchayat level.” Sawant said 20-30 persons die every day on an average. “The state government is working to bring down the mortality rate. Only doctors cannot bring down the mortality rate. We will have to work on how we can bring it down at our end,” he said. Separate vaccination centres will now be put up, away from the primary health centres, to reduce mingling. He told panchayat members to raise awareness among villagers so they do not all rush to Goa Medical College and Hospital and burden the central team of doctors. He said all facilities, including Remdesivir vials, have been made available in district hospitals. Sawant said he continues to receive complaints that patients in home isolation are not receiving calls to enquire about their parameters. He said as PHC calls may not go through at times and panchayats need to be vigilant and help out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/track-symptomatic-persons-ensure-no-super-spreaders-in-your-area-sawant-to-panchayats/articleshow/82300563.cms||---

Nagesh, a resident of Haldenahalli in Anekal taluk, had fever when he came to the Anekal hospital around 10am on Tuesday. He took both rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests. The RAT confirmed that he has Covid, and Nagesh, who was already struggling with breathlessness, requested the hospital to admit him. Driver was asked to come to hosp only with BU numberLocals said the hospital allegedly declined to admit him as he did not have a Bengaluru Urban (ID) number. He was asked to come to the hospital only with that number. Nowhere to go, Nagesh sat in the hospital building, dialling helplines to get a BU number. Around 1.30pm, Nagesh got it, but the bed was yet to be allocated. He died around 3pm. Bengaluru Urban deputy commissioner J Manjunath said: “I am not aware of this incident and will look into it. We have to see whether it was an individual’s problem or a systemic issue which led to the incident. I will ensure it will be rectified and not repeated.” The district health officer did not respond to TOI’s repeated attempts to reach him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/after-6-hr-wait-driver-27-dies-outside-hospital/articleshow/82301355.cms||Kiran Parashar
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Uncertain supply threatens to disrupt 18+ vaccine drive||BENGALURU: Shortage of Covid-19 vaccines threatens to disrupt the plan to immunise all those between 18 and 44 years from May 1. Dr Rajani MH, deputy director, mental health, department of health and family welfare, told TOI the government has placed an order for 1 crore Covishield vaccines with Serum Institute of India (SII) but it’s yet to receive them. “They haven’t given us a definite date of delivery,’’ she added. “Having placed the order for 1 crore doses, the scheme of vaccinating people between 18 and 44 years will begin as soon as the company starts supplying to the state. We’ll continue the drive for 45+ even after May 1 as scheduled,” said chief secretary P Ravi Kumar. While the bureaucrats sounded cautious, health minister K Sudhakar, in keeping with the government line that things are under control, said the fourth phase of the vaccine drive from May 1 will go on smoothly and there won’t be any shortage. “We have 3.5 lakh doses as of today and 4 lakh more will reach the state by Wednesday night,’’ he added. Health officials: Need 3-3.5 crore vax doses for 18-45 age groupHealth department officials said they may not be able to meet the increased demand for vaccines from May 1 unless they get fresh stocks by Thursday. “We need 3-3.5 crore doses to cover those in the 18-45 age group. One can easily assess how much we need daily to cover this group in the next 2-3 months,’’ they said. What’s worse is that a majority of private hospitals have reportedly decided not to join the fourth phase of the drive citing severe shortage of healthcare staff due to a rise in Covid patients. They have suggested the government avail the services of non-governmental organisations involved in health-related activities and paramedical staff to administer the vaccine. “Our priority right now is to save lives,” said Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association president Dr HM Prasanna. Some private hospitals have already stopped online registration on the Co-Win website due to the shortage of vaccines. “We stopped online registrations and are asking people to walk in and take a chance. While we need at least 10 vials of vaccine every day for the number of people coming in, the government has provided us with 3-4 vials,” said Prasanna. As the registration of all those above 18 opened on Co-Win portal at 4pm Wednesday, many people complained that it crashed. Some posted their experience on social media about the glitches. “Co-Win portal is not working. It says only the 45-plus can register,” they said. Sudhakar said it was only a temporary glitch. “When a lot of people log on at the same time, like on examination results day, it’s bound to cause an overload,’’ he said. People above 45 years are now worried they may miss the second dose, said some health officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/uncertain-supply-threatens-to-disrupt-18-vaccine-drive/articleshow/82301362.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

Jadhav’s recent plea said that he was more than convinced that the judge had developed a bias. Calling the allegations baseless, the prosecution, in its reply submitted before the principal judge of the sessions court on Wednesday said, “It is important to note that the matter was adjourned on various occasions and the advocate was given more than sufficient opportunity to proceed with the matter.... the hearing of the matter was fixed only with the consent of the parties and was never thrust upon them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ex-mlas-bias-charge-in-mscb-case-baseless/articleshow/82305363.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: The pandemic’s silent victims||NEW DELHI: Amid the raging second wave of Covid-19 in the city, many children who have lost their parents or whose single parent is in hospital have become the pandemic’s silent victims. Several experts and NGOs working with children say they have been receiving SOS to help these kids every day and the number has been increasing steadily. “We urgently need to find out some institutional support for a 14-year-old child, no one to take responsibility. Child is Covid-positive and in home isolation right now,” one such note read. A family friend eventually turned up, and Child Welfare Committee and Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Right (DCPCR) were also informed. “The child is in grief and devastated. Finding institutional support for her is a long-term solution,” said an activist. For another child who has lost both parents, the extended family came to the rescue. But experts point out that the extended family and friends are coming forward in the moment of grief, but some mechanism needs to be developed. NGO Protsahan, which works in 48 slums in Dwarka’s Uttam Nagar, has been inundated with calls. “For now, they are being taken care of by mama, chacha. But they are not getting closure as they are not seeing the body and are being told ‘mom will come, dad will come’. The people are in denial,” said Sonal Kapoor Singh. For now, these organisations are passing on the details to DCPCR or government shelter homes. DCPCR has also launched a helpline to help children with essentials or stress. “Individuals cannot keep a minor at home if there is no blood relation. Adoption laws are creating hindrances,” Singh added. The NGO has found many children going through post-traumatic stress disorder. “Somebody somewhere needs to come in as children do not have a space to vent out. They do not have parents to talk to. After parents, teachers are trusted, but schools are also shut.” Sunitha Krishnan, founder of Prajwala India, said that in most cases, the extended families were helping these Covid orphans. “We are looking at providing such support that one may not get from the extended family,” the Padmashree awardee told TOI. “Right now everyone in grief, everybody is looking after them; but over a period of time, they may become a burden.” She said her organisation was trying to provide educational support to these children for at least two years. Lawyer Sanhita Dasgupta is trying to form a network of lawyers to find institutional support.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/the-pandemics-silent-victims/articleshow/82299369.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Hyderabad||Prez Biden’s Congress’ speech crafted by Telangana’s Vinay Reddy||Washington: All eyes will be on US President Joe Biden as he steps up to the lectern on Wednesday night to deliver his first address to a joint session of Congress. Many ears will also be cocked to hear the US President essay an address crafted by Vinay Reddy, Biden’s chief speechwriter, whose job it is to translate the President’s ideas into words. Son of immigrants from India, Reddy was raised in Dayton, Ohio, earning a bachelor’s degree from Miami University and a Juris Doctor from the Ohio State University Moritz College of Law. His father Narayana Reddy, who is from Telangana’s Pothireddypeta village in Karimnagar, migrated to the US in 1970 after completing MBBS from Hyderabad. The family retains ties with the village, where Vinay’s grandfather Thirupathi Reddy was the sarpanch. Reddy, whose official designation is White House Director of Speechwriting, has long been Biden’s man of words, having joined him as a speechwriter during the latter’s second term as vice-president in the Obama White House. After a stint as vice president of strategic communications for the National Basketball Association, he is back at the helm of the White House team of wordsmiths, kicking off with Biden’s Inaugural address, praised for its elegance and healing touch after four years of rambling speeches by the previous incumbent. A man of few (spoken) words, Reddy abjures publicity, declining interviews and making very few public appearances. But he commands enormous respect from the covey of presidential speechwriters. “You may not know Vinay — he’s not on Twitter (smart!) and doesn’t seek the limelight. But he’s had a hand in nearly every major Biden speech, is a brilliant writer, and is incredibly kind and decent. So happy for him,” Obama’s principal speechwriter Jon Favreau said when Reddy was appointed to head the White House speechwriting team in January. And from Ben Rhodes, another top Obama aide: Biden couldn’t have chosen a better director of speechwriting than Vinay Reddy — a brilliant writer and an even better guy who knows his boss, is exceedingly smart about policy and messaging, and is in it for all the right reasons. Both the policy chops and smart messaging will be on test on Wednesday night in a speech that is expected to herald profound changes in America, bringing about what could arguably be the greatest wealth redistribution in US history packaged as relief. Parent of two small kids, Reddy is well-placed to appreciate one of the central ideas in Biden’s $1.9 trillion “American Rescue Plan,” that focuses on “once in a generation” investment to provide free or subsidised childcare and education to low and middle-income families. White House officials said the President has been working on the speech over the last few weeks with senior adviser Mike Donilon and Vinay Reddy involved in “line editing” meetings. “The President will also use the speech as an opportunity to talk about many of his other priorities, including police reform, immigration, gun safety, his ongoing work to get the pandemic under control and to putting Americans back to work,” White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said Tuesday, adding that there would also be a foreign policy section in the address. Contrary to some reports, Reddy is not the first US presidential speechwriter of Indian origin. That honour belongs to Sarada Peri, who served in Obama’s speech writing team. But Reddy got called out to prominence for his Indian heritage by Biden himself during one of the President’s typical gaffes. “It’s amazing. Indian-descent Americans are taking over the country — you, my vice president [Kamala Harris], my speechwriter, Vinay [Reddy],” Biden said impromptu, off-the-cuff remarks last month to NASA scientist Swati Mohan, who headed the Mars Rover guidance lead, adding. “I tell you what. But thank you. You guys are incredible.” Left to Vinay Reddy, he could have expressed it more elegantly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/prez-bidens-congress-speech-crafted-by-ts-vinay-reddy/articleshow/82300625.cms||---
---||Goa||Jittery migrants make beeline for railway stations to return home||MARGAO/VASCO: Memories of reverse migration that happened during the lockdown last year, where hordes of migrants began leaving for their native places, were revived on Wednesday as hundreds of migrants turned up at Vasco and Margao railway stations hoping to board the weekly Vasco-Patna express train. Bihari migrants started gathering at the Margao railway station soon after they got to know about the four-day partial lockdown announced by the state government. Railway authorities initially dismissed the arrival of the migrants as a usual situation as the Bihar-bound weekly train usually runs packed to capacity. However, as the number of migrants rushing to the stations increased significantly on Wednesday as the arrival time of the train neared, the authorities realised the gravity of the situation, and the railway police to be on alert. Konkan Railway sources, however, said that only passengers with reserved tickets are allowed to board the “special trains” that are currently in operation. A group of around 20 labourers from Jharkhand were on their way back after they didn’t see any hope in getting any immediate work. “They couldn’t find any work during the past few days and decided not to take a chance,” a volunteer who assisted them getting home told TOI. “They were working for an event management company to install mandaps, etc, before last year’s lockdown. But after returning, they were not able to find any steady work in event management. The company they used to work for hasn’t cleared their wages since December 2019, so they were forced to do odd jobs. Recently, they were working under a sub contractor to lay the underground electricity cable in Porvorim/Betim area. They finished the work assigned to them last month and were then doing odd jobs,” the volunteer said. The migrants had their families back home asking them to return. “Yet again they were made to travel in crowded compartments. The government should have communicated with the South Central Railway and Konkan Railway and arranged a few free Shramik trains before announcing the lockdown,” the volunteer said. After finding that they were going to travel ticketless, some volunteers tried to pay for tickets and food. “There were some who boarded the train without tickets, but the TC let them go,” he said. Another group of workers from Nepal said they wanted to head home because hotels and smaller guest houses are closing. At Vasco railway station, Railway police had a hard time managing the migrants who tried to break through the security check in a bid to board the train. Vasco station manager Ramdas Gudemane said, "We had an unexpected large number of migrants outside the railway station. We will have to be prepared for next Wednesday. The Vasco-Patna Express 02741 only accepts confirmed passengers. But, as they were unaware, they came with the hope of buying the tickets and boarding the train.” The train has a capacity of 1,480 passengers. At Vasco alone, 1,200 passengers boarded the train. Meanwhile, the Railways has cancelled several trains due to reduction in number of passengers in view of the Covid-19 situation. 02414/02413 Nizamuddin-Margao Rajdhani superfast bi-weekly special have been cancelled from April 30/May 2, 02120/02119 Karmali-Mumbai CSMT Tejas Superfast special from April 28/29, 02620/02619 Mangaluru Central–LTT Mumbai daily superfast from April 29/30 and 07107/07108 Margao – Mangalore Central special from April 29, Konkan Railway sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/jittery-migrants-make-beeline-for-railway-stations-to-return-home/articleshow/82300584.cms||---

Although the registration for 18-45 year olds has started, people were not able to book appointments as the government is unsure about getting supply to begin vaccinating this age group from May 1. “I could register, but none of the centres are processing appointments for the below 45 age group. The portal was opening, but I could not get a slot,” a 30-year-old told TOI. In another case, a mother of an asthmatic daughter, said that those with comorbidities in this age group should be given preference. The CoWin system doesn’t allow citizens who are medically vulnerable if they are not above 45 years, she said. ‘In every age group, there are people who need the vaccine medically. Currently, the younger ones with comorbidities are being made to wait while the second wave is raging,” the mother told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/citizens-unable-to-book-slots-for-jabs/articleshow/82300596.cms||---

As part of this, the police have decided to put up Quick Response (QR) codes at all the Covid hospitals in the city. The patrolling teams of the police will visit the hospitals in their respective jurisdiction and scan the QR codes on the mobile phones so their senior officers can know the exact location of the teams on a real-time basis.If the situation arises at some hospital, the police can take the necessary steps. Police commissioner Deepak Pandey said they have instructed the owners of private covid hospital and senior officials of government hospitals to first call the police station in their respective jurisdiction in case of a death of a covid patient. The police will rush to the hospital concerned to check the situation there. If the police think that the situation can turn volatile, they will take the necessary steps. Panday said this was important as the attacks on doctors can demoralise them. A larger number of Covid patients are being treated at private hospitals and hence at no point should the private hospitals close in fear of being attacked by patients’ relatives.Meanwhile, deputy police commissioner (Zone 2) Amol Tambe said an FIR has been lodged in connection to the case of an attack on a private hospital in Mumbai Naka after the death of covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/police-to-put-qr-codes-at-all-covid-hospitals-in-city/articleshow/82296507.cms||Santosh Sonawane

In the second wave of Covid, a total of 220 police personnel of the police commissionerate had contracted the infection. Among them, four police personnel have succumbed to the infection. Of the remaining 216 personnel, 57 have resumed duty after recovering from Covid, while the 159 patients are either hospitalized or in-home isolation. Deputy police commissioner (Zone 1) Amol Tambe said, “Police personnel cannot shy away from their duty no matter what the situation is. Since a large number of personnel are either hospitalized or are in home isolation, the police are left with no other option than to deal with the situation.” “In the time of strict restrictions imposed all over the city, the police personnel are not only going about their routine duty, but they also have the responsibility to ensure strict bandobast in various parts of the city so that citizens do not violate the Covid norms, which can lead to spreading of the infection,” said Tambe. Though the police have volunteers and home guards to assist them in the bandobast duty, the police have to remain present at various points. Currently, a huge police force has been deployed on the streets to ensure people are not moving around unnecessarily. Apart from the patrolling, every police station has set up at least three nakabandi points in their respective jurisdiction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/220-nashik-city-cops-get-covid-in-second-wave/articleshow/82296529.cms||Santosh Sonawane

At least two firemen will be deployed 24x7 at these facilities as a precautionary measure. The 16 facilities include the dedicated Covid-19 jumbo units in Shivajinagar and Baner, Covid hospitals like Naidu hospital, Kamala Nehru Hospital and six major Covid care centres, civic officials said. The PMC-run Kamala Nehru Hospital reported a fire in its parking area a couple of days ago, though the damage was limited. The PMC fire department said that its staffers were being deployed at the facilities. Prashat Ranpise, head of the PMC fire department, said, “We are deploying the staff as per availability. Some contractual staffers are expected to join in the next one week, which will strengthen our existing workforce. This will enable us to divert more staffers at the centres and also manage daily work.” The fire department has already deployed fire tender for the College of Engineering Pune (CoEP) jumbo unit, which has over 600 beds. “We have deployed a vehicle since it is a huge facility. In addition to this, our staffers are visiting the other centres regularly to check fire-fighting systems. We are seeking feedbacks from the staffers as well. The focus is to keep the fire-fighting system ready,” Ranpise said. The department has been facing shortage of manpower. Sources from the civic administration said the merger of 23 villages in the PMC limits was likely to put additional burden on various departments, the fire department. The proposal to fill vacant posts is still awaiting the state government’s nod, the sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-to-appoint-firemen-at-16-covid-facilities/articleshow/82299367.cms||---

While those with booked tickets will be allowed to travel to railway stations and the airport in their private vehicles, those who are expected to arrive could be stranded if tourist taxis are not allowed to operate. “The airport is an essential service and will be functional. There have been several flights cancelled this week. We will have to see what happens this weekend,” said Goa Airport director Gagan Malik. On Wednesday, around 40 flights were cancelled as passengers across the country continued to postpone their travel plans because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Most flights for Thursday and Friday have already reported cancellations, said sources. “Passenger footfalls have reduced to 1,500 arrivals and maybe 2,000 departures,” said Malik. Goa, which was once a preferred getaway for domestic tourists, has also been shunned as the number of Covid-19 cases surged to record highs. On Wednesday, Goa reported 3,101 fresh Covid-19 cases and 24 deaths. The total number of active cases in the state has hit 18,829. “There is no clarity whether taxis will be allowed to operate. The chief minister said public transport will not operate, but a statement by Kadamba Transport Corporation says buses will operate with 50% capacity. There is no clarity if tourist taxis will be considered as public transport or not,” said a taxi operator at Goa Airport. Most of the tourist taxis, particularly in North Goa, have been on strike for over a fortnight and have refused to ply their vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/airport-to-operate-but-no-clarity-over-taxi-service/articleshow/82300624.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The health department officials said they were all set for the vaccination drive and a plan has also been made, but the vaccines were yet to be received from the state government. In the earlier drives, vaccines were provided by the government of India. For 18-plus, the GOI has asked the state governments to meet the requirements of their residents and purchase vaccines on their own.District immunisation officer (DIO) Dr Meenu Sassan said, “The state government will provide us vaccines for 18-plus. So far, none has come. We have prepared a plan and are all set for the drive, but are awaiting the doses.”The health department is expecting a heavy rush as this age group comprises the maximum population in the country. The administration is planning 20 to 22 vaccination centres in the district from May 1. The registration for the 18 to 44 age group started on Wednesday evening, but there is no reply from the state government to any of the district health departments about the vaccines. Sources said, “The state government is waiting for registrations and supply of vaccines will be made accordingly.” The district health department is already facing acute shortage of doses due to which the senior citizens are, at times, turned back from the centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pkl-yet-to-receive-vax-from-state/articleshow/82298338.cms||Arvind Bishnoi

The man, Dinesh Tiwari (42), has been arrested. He used to work with the child’s mother at a construction site. Assistant inspector Shrikrishna Gore of Manpada police station said that Tiwari had asked the woman to elope with him, but she was not ready to abandon her husband and the child. The woman’s husband, who is also construction labourer, was away at his home town in Madhya Pradesh at the time. The police said that Tiwari then planned the abduction. Early Tuesday morning, the child’s mother woke up to find the girl missing. Given the circumstances narrated by the woman coupled with the fact that Tiwari was missing, the police suspected him. They tracked him down from technical evidence. He was found 40km away, in Badlapur where the child was traced and rescued. —Pradeep Gupta||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-yr-old-lifted-by-her-moms-lover-found-after-8-hours/articleshow/82299461.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: More oxygen from Centre, but still short of quota||NEW DELHI: Although the supply of oxygen for Covid-19 patients in the city has improved, it is still less than the quota allocated by the Centre, Delhi government said. The capital received 402 metric tonnes (MT) of medical oxygen on Wednesday as against 408MT on Tuesday. “We have been allocated 480MT of medical oxygen on April 21 and 490MT on April 25, but it is hardly reaching us in that quantity. Currently, the allocation is happening keeping in mind the number of ICU and non-ICU oxygen beds,” the AAP government said. According to a report on April 25, Delhi received 120MT oxygen from Panipat, 69MT from Modi Nagar, 30MT from Ghaziabad, 15MT from Bartiwala, 12MT from Faridabad, among other places. Due to the rising demand, it is becoming difficult to find oxygen cylinders and refilling them.  Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had sent SOS messages to industrialists and other chief ministers for providing oxygen or help with transporting it in cryogenic tankers. Hospitals have deployed officers in-charge for oxygen and are also carrying out an audit to identify cause of its excess use.  A helpline, 011-41400400, has been provided to the hospitals for making requests in a critical situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/more-o2-from-centre-but-still-short-of-quota/articleshow/82299377.cms||---

This is the first incident of farm-related suicides in the drought-hit Rayalaseema region of the state this year. Though instances of individual farmers ending their lives are common in the state, this is the first time in the recent years that an entire farmer family had entered into a suicide pact, unable to clear the farm debts. According to the police, Mancha Chandrasekhar, 37, and his wife Kalavathi, 32, gave soft drinks laced with a pesticide to their two daughters, Anjani, 15, a Class X student, and Akhila, 13, a Class VIII student, before they themselves consumed it. The incident is believed to have taken place on Tuesday, but came to light on Wednesday after a friend of Chandrasekhar went to his house, but did not receive any response on knocking the door. He then peeped into the house through a window and found the bodies lying on the ground. Nandyal deputy superintendent of police Chidananda Reddy told TOI that the police broke open the door and found the entire family dead. They had consumed soft drinks laced with a pesticide. Preliminary investigation revealed that Chandrasekhar had taken a huge loan of up to Rs 1 crore to build his house, apart from the debt he incurred due to crop loss. A dent in the revenue due to Covid-19 drove Chandrasekhar and his family to take the extreme step.  “We are investigating the case and so far, we learnt that there was close to Rs 1 crore debt that the family owed with a huge drop in income. This is the main reason for their suicide pact,” Chidananda Reddy added. The cops also suspect that there could be a cricket betting angle behind the suicide pact as the police team investigating the case found that Chandrasekhar had lost money in gambling too. The police shifted the bodies to Nandyal government hospital for postmortem. A case was registered under Section 174 of CrPC (unnatural death) at Nandyal town police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-farmer-kills-2-daughters-ends-his-life-along-with-wife/articleshow/82300678.cms||---

Among the fresh infections, as many as 3,978 were recorded in the Pune municipal limits, followed by the rural pockets (3,479) and the Pimpri Chinchwad areas (1,956). With this, the region’s total caseload has increased above 8.17 lakh. The Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal areas recorded more recoveries than new cases again on Wednesday. As many as 4,936 patients were declared cured in the PMC limits, while 3,315 patients were discharged in the Pimpri Chinchwad areas, taking the total recoveries in PMR to 7.10 lakh. Of the total number of recoveries, more than 3.59 lakh patients have been been cured in the PMC limits alone. The Pimpri Chinchwad have reported recoveries of 1.80 lakh patients, while the rural areas have recorded 1.70 lakh discharges so far. An increase in the number of daily discharges has pushed down the tally of active cases in the region. On Wednesday, the active caseload decreased to 94,256. These included 63,337 patients in home isolation and 30,919 patients being treated at various hospitals across PMR. Of the 154 fatalities recorded in PMR on Wednesday, 58 deaths were reported in the PMC limits alone, followed by the PCMC reported areas (55) and the rural pockets (41). The tally of deaths in PMR has now increased to 12,762 so far. “Many of the deceased suffered from comorbidities like hypertension,” a health official said. The region also reported an increase in daily tests to 41,833 from Tuesday’s tally of 33,665. The day’s positivity rate dropped to 22.5% in PMR on Wednesday. “Testing and contact tracing are vital to keep the situation under control,” a health expert said, adding that vaccination needed to be ramped up to keep a check on positivity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmr-toll-hits-new-peak-recoveries-top-infections/articleshow/82298394.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Dehradun||10-fold rise in funeral fires past month: Geo-analytic expert after satellite data||DEHRADUN: It was a normal working day for Raj Bhagat, a geo-analytic and earth observation expert who works with a global environment research organisation in its India office, but what he saw on his computer screen was very unusual. There were signs of a huge fire, mostly near the river beds in the cities of Northern India. "There are orange dots --- an unprecedented rise in fire signals picked up via satellite short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands --- that, too, near river beds, something very rare to be found in this area,” said Bhagat, who uses satellite mapping to track forest fires and farm stubble-burning incidents. Out of curiosity, he dug more, using Google co-ordinates and to his shock, those areas---which were showing huge fire-like incidents--- were actually crematoriums. “In most cases, the intensity of fires had increased 10 times,” said Bhagat who used data from the European Union Earth Observation Programme, an award winning satellite imagery service. The areas tracked by him include ghats in cities like Varanasi, Kanpur, Mau, Ghazipur, Prayagraj, Noida and Mathura to name a few. “The fact that the cremation fires are burning with so much intensity -- which has never been seen before -- puts a question mark on the death figures given by the governments of these areas,” said Bhagat, who tracked the high-intensity flames between April 20 and 25. As per government data, Kanpur district reported 102 Covid deaths between April 20-25, while in Varanasi, the number of Covid deaths in this period was 64. In Mathura, the figure was 13 in this duration whereas it was 49 in Gautam Buddha Nagar, 74 in Prayagraj, 14 in Ghazipur and only 1 in Mau district of UP. According to Bhagat, the satellite data indicates intense fires in crematoriums in all the districts during these dates. Speaking specifically about Varanasi, where ghats witness a large number of cremations every day, Bhagat told TOI that the fire intensity at Manikarnika ghat, which sees the maximum number of cremations was “2.4 times more than the highest detected intensity in the past.” “The fire intensity was 75 times more in an area called Wajid Patti. I found two ghats to the east of Varanasi — which were detected for the first time, which means that cremations started happening at massive scale here as well,” he added. Reacting to the findings, Pramod Tiwari, veteran UP Congress leader said, “The government claims that Covid-related deaths are decreasing and under control. What we see is just the opposite. At present, when people are not moving much, accidental deaths and several other kinds of deaths have decreased, but still if cremation fires are burning with such intensity that they are being captured in satellite data, this shows that actual data regarding deaths is being hidden.” TOI tried to contact Varanasi district magistrate Varanasi, Kaushal Raj Sharma, Kanpur DM Alok Tiwari and Gautam Buddha Nagar DM Suhas LY for their response but they could not be reached despite several attempts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/10-fold-rise-in-funeral-fires-past-month-geo-analytic-expert-after-sat-data/articleshow/82297318.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Goa||Cong files police plaint against CM, BJP MLAs||Bicholim: Congress on Wednesday filed a police complaint against chief minister Pramod Sawant and two BJP MLAs for violating social distancing protocols during the inauguration of a bridge over Valvanti river in Sakhali. Criticising the chief minister for being part of a gathering of 300-odd people, Congress questioned Sawant’s seriousness in managing the pandemic and avoiding super spreader events. “Two days ago, I demanded that the Goa chief minister must walk the talk on handling and management of Covid-19. Today Pramod Sawant walks with hordes of people while spreading awareness of social distancing. This is how the BJP government responds to concerns of the opposition,” opposition leader Digambar Kamat said. The Margao MLA said that it was “shocking to see hundreds of people walking on the bridge along with the chief minister, sending social distancing norms for a toss”. He demanded that the authorities book all those who violated Section 144. “When the chief minister himself violates restrictions imposed under Section 144 by his own government, it sends a wrong signal to the public,” Kamat said. The party’s North Goa district president Vijay Bhike filed a police complaint at the Bicholim police station and sought action against Sawant, Mayem MLA Pravin Zantye and Mapusa MLA Joshua de Souza. In his complaint, Bhike said that as per the order issued by the North Goa collector Ajit Roy, no more than 50 people can gather at a location for an event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-files-police-plaint-against-cm-bjp-mlas/articleshow/82300634.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Kolkata||Ambulances fleece families as demand soars in second wave||KOLKATA: For a ride from Dhakuria to a private hospital at Panchasayar — without oxygen — with a brief stop over at another private hospital at Mukundapur, Nirmala Baidya had to spend Rs 3,500. Similarly, an accountant, who lives in Girish Park, said that no one picked up the government helpline numbers when his father’s condition deteriorated and he had to be hospitalised. Local ambulances refused. One driver asked for Rs 8,000. Finally, a neighbour gave the two a lift. There are stories galore about private ambulances making a killing in this distress situation, extorting thousands of rupees from families when the fares should be a few hundreds. Ambulance operators are demanding Rs 3,000-Rs 4,000 for a transport from RG Kar Hospital to Medical College, a distance that is within 6km. They are charging Rs 3,000 for 3.5km distance from Park Circus to SSKM. Swapan Ghosh, a resident of Park Circus, said that he asked for oxygen supply but it was never provided to his 13-year-old son experiencing respiratory distress. Flooded with complaints, Kolkata traffic cops have decided to step in after Thursday’s elections. “We will undertake special drives with health and transport department officials. We will also keep men posted at hospitals and act against those who are overcharging with spot cancellation of registration,” warned a joint commissioner of police. KMC officials will also meet local clubs and ask them to ensure that ambulance drivers charge rationally. “Clubs have rented out ambulances to third parties. But they cannot absolve their responsibility. The maximum fare for transportation to a hospital within the city limit is Rs 600. An additional Rs 100 can be charged for oxygen support,” said a civic health official. But despite assurances from the administration, TOI found rampant overcharging by ambulance operators in the city. When asked about the charge for a ride to New Alipore from SSKM, an operator replied Rs 1,200. “It could go up by another Rs 400 if you hire an AC ambulance with an oxygen cylinder,” he said. Most of them charge an additional Rs 100 if the patient has to be driven into a by-lane off the main road. In case, the distance from the main road is over 500m, a further Rs 100 is levied. The average rate is marginally lower than SSKM. A ride between CNMC and Chittaranjan Avenue could cost Rs 1,000 for a non-AC vehicle. But operators warned that the rates could fluctuate, depending on the demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ambulances-fleece-families-as-demand-soars-in-second-wave/articleshow/82298407.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Mumbai||Vaccine registration opens for 18+, but state may begin drive only by May-end||New Delhi/Mumbai: Online registration for Covid-19 vaccination picked up on Wednesday after the government opened CoWin for the next phase of the drive to cover all those above 18 years of age. However, people were unable to book appointments as most centres displayed 45-plus as the minimum age required to receive the jabs. On Wednesday, a total of over 1.23 crore registrations took place till 10.45pm. In Maharashtra, the MVA government made it clear it would not roll out the drive from May 1 due to erratic supply. It may take off by May-end instead. The state hopes to complete vaccinations for this age group in six months, provided they have a monthly stock of 2 crore doses. “A vaccination schedule will be announced once planning for procurement of vaccine stocks is done,” said CM Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday. “The state cabinet has approved free vaccination at government centres. People opting to go to a private facility will have to pay for the vaccine,” said public health minister Rajesh Tope. The state’s overall population is estimated at roughly 12.5 crore. The allocation includes the cost of procuring vaccines and logistical expenses. Officials said the state is likely to purchase in bulk and sell it to private hospitals as per requirements. Rates to be charged by private hospitals to vaccinate beneficiaries has not been fixed though. The cabinet has decided to set up a committee with ministers and officials to plan the rollout strategy. It is likely that the state may further segment age categories into 18-25, 25-35 and 35-44 and give priority to the older ones and those with comorbidities, till vaccine supply steadies. Nearly 22 states in the country have announced free vaccination for the 18-plus gge group. Several states have said they are unable to start the drive due to lack of doses. “We want to keep the pace of vaccination consistent and unaffected and complete it in a time-bound manner and so we will first ensure seamless vaccine supply and then roll out the drive,” said Tope. Officials said to avoid crowding, inoculation centres for the 18-44 group will be different from those used for the 45-plus age group. In this drive, people with only pre-registration will be allowed, walk-ins will not be allowed. Maharashtra will require nearly 12 crore doses to vaccinate the 18-44 age group. It is in talks with manufacturers of Covaxin and Covishield to procure stocks. In a meeting with Thackeray, Serum Institute of India CEO Adar Poonwalla had said their production is committed to the Centre entirely till May 24. “Covaxin has in a letter to the state said that they will be able to provide 10 lakh doses for two months starting May and will double its supply to 20 lakh. But this may not be enough. Covishield makers have not sent a written reply, but they have verbally committed one crore doses from May end,” said Tope. The pricing for supplies has not been finalised. Tope said the cabinet has also approved the proposal to import vaccines and the state is in talks with manufacturers of Sputnik V, Zydus Cadila and Johnson and Johnson, which may be available in the next 3-4 months. Officials said the younger age groups will not prefer waiting in long queues and will rather go to private hospitals by paying for doses. “Though we have planned for 5.7 crore, nearly 40% of beneficiaries, mostly from cities, will go to the private sector,” said an official. Also, several corporates, business associations have shown interest in vaccinating their staff at their own cost. Officials added once procurement starts, the state will buy doses for the 45-plus age group as well. Meanwhile, the state’s Covid task force has suggested that vaccinations be done in two shifts when the drive for the 18-44 group is rolled out. While morning shifts can be for senior citizens and those above 45, the evening shifts can be for those between 18 and 45. “There are long queues of senior citizens. So we have advised the state government to increase the number of centres and timings too. The centres can operate in two shifts. Morning shift for 45 and above and senior citizens. In this slot, there can be space for specially abled persons between 18-45. The other young persons from 18-45 should be vaccinated in the evening shift,” said Dr Sanjay Oak, head of the state’s Covid Task Force.

Goa’s industry bodies said that the government still needs to take stringent steps to ensure social distancing and adherence to Covid protocols in public spaces. “Industry welcomes the decision of the chief minister to keep economic activity on. We commit to the CM that we will take utmost care to follow all the SOPs laid down for the industries,” Goa State Industries Association president Damodar Kochkar said. Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Manoj Caculo said that even though the restrictions would impact the retail sector, the state government had taken the right decision. “Walking a tightrope to balance the views and needs of medical fraternity and keeping the economy running, we feel the chief minister has taken the right decision. This lockdown will not totally disrupt the industry functioning, although there will be challenges and difficulties,” Caculo said. Though industry heads accepted the state government’s move to impose the restrictions, they categorically stated that the lockdown is not the solution to manage the pandemic. Widespread testing, aggressive vaccination drives and stringent enforcement of Covid protocols offer a better strategy to tackle the pandemic, industry leaders said. Several industrial units have reduced floor strength to 50% and have asked non-essential staff to work from home or on rotation. Some units have also started deducting a day’s pay or half a day’s wages of any employee found without a mask or not maintaining social distance. Jadhav also said that four to five day wait for RT-PCR test results is not acceptable if the state wants to cut down on Covid-19 cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/relief-for-goa-inc-as-industry-kept-out-of-lockdown/articleshow/82300675.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The civic body is also urging them to come forward for donation of plasma voluntarily. The idea is to help other employees who are facing a shortage. The east corporation has also started a similar exercise. During the current Covid pandemic, the number of critical patients requiring plasma has been increasing with each passing day.  “Since a number of our employees and their family members have recovered, we are requesting them to voluntarily come forward and donate plasma. The HODs have been asked to collect details of such employees who have recovered in the past one month and are willing to help. The compiled report will be shared with hospitals via email or on WhatsApp,” said north corporation mayor Jai Prakash. “We are also in the process of establishing a plasma bank at Hindu Rao. Meanwhile, a bank account has been created wherein officials are requested to donate funds for helping the needy staff,” said the mayor. In east Delhi, civic authorities are collecting information of Covid-positive staff on a daily basis. “We have about 61 staff who tested positive till April 25, out of which 41 are doctors.

For more than a week, he was undergoing treatment at a private hospital. Eighty-one-year-old Gaikwad was the father of school education minister Varsha Gaikwad. Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, NCP president Sharad Pawar, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, state Congress president Nana Patole, public works minister Ashok Chavan and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat have condoled his death. “As a member of the state legislative assembly and later as a member of the Lok Sabha, Gaikwad constantly endeavoured for the development of Mumbai. In his demise, the city has lost a leader of the masses,” Koshyari said in his condolence message. Gaikwad, a popular politician in Dharavi, from where he was elected to the legislative assembly, was always accessible to people. Gaikwad’s top priority was to the people of his constituency. Born in Satara district, Gaikwad was a hard core Congress activists and throughout his political career, he was loyal to the Congress party and the Gandhi family.

---||Goa||Al Wahda prove two good for FC Goa in concluding group clash||Margao: Al Wahda proved too good for FC Goa as they cruised to a 2-0 win and sealed a place in the knockout stage of the AFC Champions League. Needing a win to assure themselves a place in the next stage of the high-profile league, Al Wahda were jittery in the first half but did enough in the second to grab all points against Goa, who were forced to field an all-Indian lineup at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Thursday. After trying and missing several times in the first 45 minutes, Omar Khribin gave Al Wahda the lead just after the hour mark, while Dutch coach Henk ten Cate was a relieved man only in the final minute when captain Mohammed Al-Menhali made it 2-0. The UAE side finished with 13 points which guarantees them one of the three best second-placed slots from West Asia. Goa’s goals stemmed from defensive mistakes, not surprising for a side that fielded an all-Indian squad after all foreign players and coach Juan Ferrando left for Spain over Covid-19 fears, less than 24 hours earlier. The debutants were on the backfoot from the start and conceded 67 percent ball possession. Without foreign players, Goa didn’t have anyone to either start from the back, or keep the ball in the middle. Goa tried, though. In the opening half, the defence led by centre-back Adil Khan – heavily criticised for a shaky performance against Persepolis where he lasted just 28 minutes – kept the rival attackers at bay with goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh again playing an influential role. Glan Martins, Amarjit Singh and Brandon Fernandes all tried to stay true to the Goa style of play. But whenever they tried to string passes together, they found themselves swarmed by Al Wahda players, who didn’t find it difficult to win the ball back. Goa conceded the first goal after being put under pressure by a high-press in the 61st minute. Glan lost the ball to Tim Matavz in a dangerous area and the Slovenian striker outfoxed his marker, got into the box and delivered a low cross for Khribin to do the rest from close range. Khribin, a former Asian player of the year, was brilliantly stopped by Dheeraj in the opening half. The Syrian striker was one-on-one with the youngster, but as he tried to lift the ball, Dheeraj managed to get his hand. The goalkeeper also made a five save to deny Matavz but was forced off the field due to an injury he picked up, after colliding with defender Sanson Pereira. His replacement, Naveen Kumar, didn’t really inspire confidence within his teammates, or the fans. He was guarding Goa’s goal in the 0-4 defeat against Persepolis and was guilty of conceding soft goals. But nobody could point a finger at him for the second one. It happened in the 90th minute, again from a defensive lapse. This time Aiban Dohling lost the ball inside the box to Khribin, who squared it for Al-Menhali. The Al Wahda captain’s attempt struck Adil’s outstretched leg and sailed into the net, giving no chance to the goalkeeper. In sharp contrast to Al Wahda’s 25 attempts, Goa had little to show. There were three shots, two of them on target, but nothing that could force the young Mohamed al-Shamsi to make a good save. Goa finished their maiden campaign without a win but had three points in their kitty, one more than bottom-placed Qatar Stars League side Al Rayyan, coached by France’s 1998 World Cup winner Laurent Blanc. For a team making its debut in Asian football’s premier club competition, they’ll take that.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/al-wahda-prove-two-good-for-fc-goa-in-concluding-group-clash/articleshow/82317195.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

---||Chandigarh||FIR against cops for interrupting O2 supply for patient who died||Jind: Jind police landed in controversy after a 60-year-old Covid patient allegedly died in a hospital in Ghaziabad, in Uttar Pradesh for want of oxygen, as the supply got interrupted by the Gatauli police chowki in the district on Monday night. A relative of the patient Rajender Singh has lodged a complaint with the deputy inspector general and superintendent of police of Jind that he got a call from his relative that one of their family members is admitted in hospital and needed oxygen as the hospital’s oxygen supply was likely to finish by 3-4am. The victim alleged that he arranged two oxygen cylinders and sent a person Gurpreet Singh alias Nikka to deliver oxygen to the patient in a hospital in Ghaziabad from Dhuri town of Sangrur district in Punjab. The complainant alleged that the vehicle carrying oxygen was stopped near the Gatauli police chowki in Jind district by the police at around 11 pm. The driver tried to argue that he was on the way to supply oxygen to a patient who is in emergency condition. However, he said, the police did not listen to him and the patient died for want of oxygen in the hospital. Therefore, he demanded action against the cops who halted the vehicle. The driver said, “I made a video call as well to show the admitted patient but my phone was snatched by the police. I continued to appeal them to leave me but I was locked in a room. In the morning, police took me to the civil hospital and we came to know about the death of the patient. The police left leaving me alone at the hospital premise.” Deputy superintendent of police Pushpa Khatri said they received a complaint alleging that the police had stopped the vehicle carrying oxygen cylinders for a patient. She said the Jind police SP has ordered an inquiry into the matter. “We will take action against those found guilty,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/fir-against-cops-for-interrupting-o2-supply-for-patient-who-died/articleshow/82299480.cms||---
---||Nashik||18-44 year olds have a frustrating first day of vaccine registration||Nashik/Aurangabad: The first day of online registration for Covid vaccination for citizens in the 18-44 year age group — a new category added to the existing groups of beneficiaries — did not go as smoothly as the officials would have hoped for. Many people were let down by technical glitches in the CoWIN app and portal, while others were left frustrated trying again and again to enrol their names on Wednesday morning not aware that the registration process was to start only at 4pm.“The government’s decision to allow people above 18 years to get the Covid vaccine is very good. I tried to register myself as soon as the government opened its app and portal for registration. However, I failed as the server was down and there were other technical glitches too,” said Prashant Suryvanshi, a private employee in Nashik. “I tried for almost one-and-a-half hours before giving up,” he added. Suryavanshi feels the system would have worked better if the 18-44 years category was split into three groups — 35-44 years, 25-34 years and 18-24 years — to prevent the rush which may have overwhelmed the system.Shubham Rakecha, another Nashik resident, too tried to register multiple times but in vain. “I could not register on the CoWIN app as the server was very slow. That was a disappointment,” he said.Abhishek Kale, an insurance and financial consultant, had a similar experience. He said he first tried to register sharp at 4 pm, but could not succeed even after an hour. “Finally, I stopped and decided to wait for the app to work properly,” said Kale.In Aurangabad, many people had planned to register themselves early in the day, not knowing that the necessary window was accessible only after 4 pm. Many citizens said they wasted their time and effort because they were not made aware of the registration timing. The second half of the day compounded their frustrations as they faced severe technical problems while using the official portal — www.cowin.gov.in. The technical glitch issue was also trending on social media.“I tried to register as soon as I got up at 7 am. I was taken aback to see that it was facilitating formalities only for those above the age of 45. Later, through WhatsApp groups, I came to know that the registration was slated to begin only at 4 pm,” said Supriya Kale, a homemaker in her 30s.Ulhas Deodhar, a 39-year old professional, said the online issues in the evening were frustrating. “There is already so much gloom around due to the pandemic and reports of deaths. While the vaccination is seen as a ray of hope, the authorities had not planned the registration process well. Moreover, the news of no immediate vaccination for those in the 18-45 category is disappointing,” he said.Meanwhile, the municipal limits of Aurangabad on Wednesday witnessed 4,489 vaccinations amid depleted vaccine stocks. The civic administration said the fresh supply of doses is expected shortly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/18-44-year-olds-have-a-frustrating-first-day-of-vaccine-registration/articleshow/82296567.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi University college creates a 100-bed isolation centre||NEW DELHI: In the midst of an unprecedented Covid crisis, Delhi University’s Lakshmibai College has set up a 100-bedded isolation centre inside the campus. The centre in northwest Delhi will start taking in Covid patients from Thursday onwards. However, it will only cater to those with mild and moderate symptoms and people below 70 years of age. Sangita Sharma, one of the teachers at the college, had lost the battle to Covid last week. The centre has been dedicated to her. Pratyush Vatsala, principal of the college, told TOI, “As we cannot manage ICU facilities, we are not going to accept serious patients. However, we have arranged for oxygen too. The opening got a little delayed as we were also trying to have a back-up.” The centre has been set up in collaboration with an NGO and with permission from the district administration. “I thought, when there is infrastructure in place built with public funds, why not use it for people who are struggling for facilities. For almost a year, the educational institutions have been closed. At least if patients with mild and moderate symptoms can be admitted here, a lot of pressure can be reduced from the hospitals,” she added. All the necessary arrangements for food, medical waste disposal, barricading, etc have been made. The health and wellness centre of the college has been turned into an office. “Many people from Ashok Vihar supported us. We have doctors and a dedicated team of nurses. We have taken young nurses who have completed their studies. Facilities for them to stay in the campus have also been provided,” said the principal. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya (DDU) College is also planning to set up a similar facility. Hem Chand Jain, the principal of the college, said, “We are trying for it. Once it is done, everyone will be informed. We are trying to involve some civil society members as well. It is a collaborative effort of the DM office, DU, Iskcon temple and the college.” According to an official from the university, it will be a 180-bed Covid isolation centre. It is expected to be operational from the weekend and will be located at the hostel block of DDU in Dwarka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-college-creates-a-100-bed-isolation-centre/articleshow/82299489.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Surat||Govt hospitals in Surat stop taking in new patients||SURAT: Two of the biggest Covid-19 hospitals in the region — the New Civil Hospital (NCH) and the Surat Municipal Institute of Medical Education and Research (SMIMER) — have closed their gates to new patients on Wednesday. This, the administrations attribute to the acute shortage of oxygen supply. Despite having beds and necessary infra to handle even critical patients, these hospitals have turned their backs on severely infected patients only to avoid a crisis-like situation in managing patients already under treatment there. Till Monday, many ambulances were bringing in Covid-19 patients round the clock. But with the oxygen crisis taking a sharper turn, the situation has become difficult even for the government hospitals to manage patients, majority of whom arrive requiring urgent oxygen support. Earlier, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Surat, which had sought supply of 230 MT oxygen for government and private hospitals in the city alleged that nearly 20 percent less oxygen was disbursed to the city against earlier supply. Private hospitals too are decreasing their bed count or admitting new patients even if a bed gets vacated. “I don’t know what to do now. I have been coughing constantly and its getting difficult to breathe without oxygen support. I need to get hospitalized but they are denying me entry,” said Santosh Panda, (56), a migrant labour in a textile mill from Chalthan. A native of Odisha, Panda was brought to the NCH in an 108 ambulance, but after denied entry, the emergency medical technician said they will take him to an isolation centre after checking if there is space anywhere. “Since NCH and SMIMER are not taking patients we are now taking them to isolation centres. Those needing ventilator support have only option of going to private hospital if they can provide for the bed,” said an official of 108 ambulance service. “Due to shortage of oxygen we are unable to admit new patients. We are hopeful the situation will improve soon,” said Yogesh Chaudhary, nodal officer for NCH. “We are getting less oxygen than our daily requirement and so, we have stopped taking new patients. If we continue admitting more, it will be life threatening for the existing patients,” said Puneet Nayyar, nodal officer of SMIMER.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/govt-hospitals-stop-taking-in-new-patients/articleshow/82297399.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Dehradun||Hospital in Doon says it has 3 hours of oxygen left, gets supply for 7 more hours after sending SOS alert||DEHRADUN: Kailash Hospital, one of the biggest private hospitals in Dehradun, sent an SOS alert to the district administration at 3pm on Wednesday, saying its oxygen supply would last for three hours only and at 6 pm, all patients on oxygen support would have to be shifted. At the time, 200 Covid-19 patients were undergoing treatment at the facility, 150 of them on oxygen support. The announcement by the hospital sent patients and families into shock. The district administration managed to arrange 1 ton of oxygen against the hospital’s demand of 3.5 tons by 6 pm, which would last the next seven hours. The hospital said that some patients started gasping as the stock depleted and medical staff used portable oxygen cylinders for them. Pawan Sharma, director of the hospital, told TOI that they had been seeking help for oxygen since the morning on Wednesday and the authorities were only making assurances of supply. “Considering we had such a high number of patients, we were forced to issue an SOS call. I’m aware that the situation is difficult for everyone but there was no other option,” said Sharma. He said that the hospital had consumed 350 tons of oxygen in the past 10 days. Sachin Kurve, nodal officer of oxygen supply in Uttarakhand told TOI that oxygen was immediately arranged for Kailash Hospital and that there was no need to panic. “We are alert and continuously in touch with all hospitals. The matter was resolved within minutes after we received the SOS message,” he said. Other hospitals in the district, which recorded 2,329 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, are also facing similar crises. Arihant Hospital, where 75 Covid-19 patients are in ICU, ventilator and on oxygen support, sent out an SOS alert to the administration for oxygen on Tuesday night. They also used portable cylinders till the time oxygen concentrators reached. Dr Abhishek Jain from Arihant Hospital confirmed the development. “We are overburdened and the demand for oxygen has increased drastically. There is a limit to how much oxygen we can store,” he said. Dr Mahesh Kuriyal from CMI Hospital, told TOI that the hospital is currently stretched to its maximum capacity. “We have 60 beds of oxygen and are filling the concentrators twice daily, which is three times our usual demand. We have oxygen but supply and distribution will be hit if we increase even one more bed,” said the doctor. He added that “the administration is helping in every possible way, be it for oxygen or medicine, but the patient load is too much to handle with a limited number of staff, as most employees had contracted the virus. “ Similar is the case with Max Hospital, where there are 200 oxygen beds at present. “We can’t increase even one more bed. The entire oxygen supply system will collapse if we do,” said Dr Rahul Prasad, chief medical superintendent of Max Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hospital-in-doon-says-it-has-3-hours-of-oxygen-left-gets-supply-for-7-more-hours-after-sending-sos-alert/articleshow/82297388.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Chandigarh||PGI to conduct follow-up study of patients after ICU discharge||Chandigarh: The PGI will conduct a follow-up study in Covid-19 patients’ post ICU discharge for a period of three months. The study will be done to compare if the type of oxygen therapy received either in the form mechanical ventilation or non-invasive ventilation has a bearing effect on the patients’ post discharge complications. Often, such patients develop complications from oxygen therapy after they are discharged. The trial has been approved by the institute’s ethics committee. Principal investigator Dr Amarjyoti Hazarika from the department of anaesthesia and intensive care unit at the PGI will conduct the non-randomised active control trial for a year. The researchers at the Covid-19 hospital have seen that post discharge, Covid-19 patients land up in physical and medical complications that might interfere with their daily life. “Patients after getting discharged from the ICU may have a readmission rate going up to 80%. New or worsened impairment after an ICU stay, persist past hospital discharge. Anxiety and depression were reported in most of the ICU patients,” mentioned the research statement. The doctors, who have been treating such patients in the ICUs, have witnessed that prolong mechanical ventilation leads to muscle weakness and fatigue which may be the reason for deterioration in health and quality of life and physical function. Rehabilitation of these patients post ICU pose several challenges. “The information from the study may help in formulating a uniform directive and rehabilitation programme to be followed for Covid-19 patients after they are discharged from the ICU,” mentioned the statement. The study shall recruit 50 patients. The study proposed that based on the outcome, the health care workers can evolve strategies to address these concerns in such patients. Exercise programmes directed towards increasing strength and balance along with good nutrition to improve functional capacity should be commenced soon after discharge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgi-to-conduct-follow-up-study-of-patients-after-icu-discharge/articleshow/82299470.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra to adopt dry swab tech to get Covid results in 4 hours||PUNE: Covid-19 test reports will soon be available in four hours as the state government moves in to adopt the dry swab technology for RT-PCR tests. It scores over the traditional method of RT-PCT tests as nasal and throat swabs are collected and transported in a dry state without the expensive liquid viral transport medium, making the handling of samples easy and less prone to spillage and spread of infection. The testing omits the RNA isolation step from the sample, cutting down on the time to process the results from 12 hours to just four hours. Maharashtra increased daily testing from 1,20,000 per day to 2,50,000 in the first two weeks of April. It has remained in this range since then. State task force member Shashank Joshi told TOI the state will soon adopt the ICMR- approved dry swab technology in all the laboratories. “The CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) has developed this technology. Citizens have been complaining that the wait for the RT-PCR results stretches 12 to 13 hours, which will now reduce to four hours with the dry swab direct RT-PCR method,” Joshi added. CCMB’s director Rakesh Mishra said the method would scale up testing with no new investment. “Considering its minimal cost and quick turnaround time, it is expected to benefit more citizens,” he added. He said the new testing takes four hours for some 500 samples. VTM and RNA extraction both add a significant burden on costs and time required for mass testing for the coronavirus, he added. “The RNA isolation from the sample takes up time, cost and trained manpower. The dry swab method is cost-effective, easy to implement with no requirement of new kits and can be done with the current manpower. It can make a significant contribution to ramping up the testing capacity,” Mishra said. Shekhar Mande, director-general of CSIR, said the institute’s innovation was helpful in a difficult time. Doctors emphasise that early detection of the virus helps in quarantining cases and curbs the virus spread.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-to-adopt-dry-swab-tech-to-get-covid-results-in-4-hrs/articleshow/82298466.cms||Nisha Nambiar

A purported video of this heartbreaking moment went viral on social media on Wednesday, even as there is a major "oxygen crisis" in the country triggered by the Covid surge. The video was said to have been filmed on Monday evening outside the city's prominent hospital in Sadar locality. In the clip, amid the chaos, a private ambulance can be seen parked outside the hospital. Oxygen cylinders taken out from the hospital and escorted by cops were being loaded into the waiting ambulance. A man in a PPE suit, son of a critical patient, then appears and says, “From where will I arrange the cylinder. I had come after promising my family that I will bring back my mother alive." Further, in the clip, the man can be seen getting down on his knees and starts begging before the cops not to take away the cylinders, but the cops continue with their work. The individual who purportedly shot the video, told TOI, “Cops came and took two cylinders filled with oxygen from the hospital. A man in a PPE suit with his mother under treatment at the hospital begged the policemen not to take away the cylinders." "The hospital had no oxygen left to save the critical patients,” he claimed. SP (City) Botre Rohan Pramod refuted the allegations of policemen taking away the oxygen-filled cylinders from the hospital. “The man was requesting the police to provide him with an oxygen cylinder for treatment of his relative. But, no one was taking away any cylinders. The video is misleading,” Pramod said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/man-begs-cops-not-to-take-away-oxygen-cylinder-meant-for-hospital-video-viral/articleshow/82298465.cms||Deepak Lavania

Healthcare workers are dispensing services under fear of being attacked and getting roughed up,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association's Hospital Board of India, an association of small and medium-size hospitals in Pune.A doctor of Sathe hospital in Deccan Gymkhana said, “We are getting only 40% of the daily requirement of oxygen supply every alternate day. We have 15 oxygen beds and three ICU beds. It has now come to begging and borrowing oxygen cylinders to support our patients now."The oxygen crisis has not improved in the past 15 days. “We have seven Covid patients on ventilator support. Besides, 30 patients are on basic oxygen support. The oxygen storage in our hospital will last only for a few hours. We kept sending out distress messages on various doctor/hospital’s groups to gather support," said a doctor from Silver Birch hospital in Dhayari requesting anonymity.“We finally got a re-filler, who had 4,000 litre of medical oxygen, on Wednesday. He could support 25 small and medium-size hospitals reeling under a severe shortage. But this supply will not last them for more than two to three days,” Patil said.Consumption of medical oxygen in the Pune district has reached 383 tonnes as against its full daily production capacity of 350 tonnes. Pune has over one lakh active Covid-19 cases and around 30,000 patients are admitted to various hospitals. This is highest for any district. Currently, almost all big hospitals’ casualty or emergency departmen remain crowded with 15 to 20 Covid patients accommodated on recliners or beds put up outside these wards.Pramod Kubade, secretary of, the Pimpri Chinchwad Hospital Owners Association, said the Oxygen situation was no different in the private hospitals of the twin towns. “Over 100 hospitals are associated with us and we support each other in testing times like these. We borrow (oxygen cylinders) from other member hospitals or request them accordingly. The patients’ lives come first,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/o2-crunch-compels-hospitals-to-beg-or-borrow-cylinders/articleshow/82298480.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The doctors — Yogeshwar Chaudhary from Mumbai’s J J Medical College Hospital and Santosh Pawar from Pune’s Sassoon hospital — hail from Nandurbar district and have been working at the Nandurbar civil hospital for over eight hours daily. While Chaudhary was requested by Nandurbar district collector Rajendra Bharud, his close friend, to help him out in the district which has been wracked by the second wave of the pandemic, Pawar volunteered to offer his services in view of the shortage of doctors there. Chaudhary will be appearing for his post-graduation examination this year while Pawar has already completed his post-graduation. “Bharud requested me to treat Covid patients in Nandurbar as the district needs more doctors. He is my close friend and, at this critical juncture, I want to help him,” Chaudhary told TOI. Chaudhary and Bharud have been friends since their school days and both were active sportsmen. Both are alumni of Seth GS Medical college and KEM Hospital, Mumbai, although Bharud is four years senior to Chaudhary. “The place of work, be it Mumbai or Nandurbar, hardly matters to me. Our goal is to save the lives of patients. Moreover, I am standing by my close friend in these trying times,” said Chaudhary. Pawar said he learnt that Nandurbar was in dire need of doctors and volunteered to go there. “Nandurbar is my own district and I am helping the people here in times of distress. It’s extremely satisfying.” Both doctors, wearing PPE kits, examine around 200 Covid patients on oxygen support daily and instruct the nurses about the treatment and medicines that are needed. Bharud is thankful to the two doctors. “I am grateful to them for travelling to Nandurbar to treat patients. The people in the district will always remember them. Unless we have adequate number of doctors, how can the patients get treatment?” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/2-doctors-from-pune-mumbai-join-fight-against-covid-in-nandurbar/articleshow/82296577.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor, meanwhile, said salaries of north and east Delhi municipal corporations are not being paid on time because the AAP government has not released the outstanding funds to the civic bodies.

---||Mumbai||SII cuts vax price 25% in ‘philanthropic gesture’||Mumbai: Facing a public outcry over the pricing of its Covid vaccine Covishield, Serum Institute of India on Wednesday announced a 25% or Rs 100 reduction in its price for state governments, describing it as a “philanthropic gesture”. The bad news is that at Rs 300 a shot, it will still be twice what the Centre is paying, reports Rupali Mukherjee. For private hospitals, the price has been left unchanged at Rs 600 a shot. The vaccine is also unlikely to be easily available in the private market until September-October. A Serum Institute official had earlier told TOI: “Owing to the complexity and urgency of the situation, it is challenging to supply it independently to each corporate entity.” Criticism from state governments and civil society, however, seems to have forced Serum Institute to reduce prices. A news agency report had also said that the Centre has taken up the issue with Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech as both companies had raised prices. “As a philanthropic gesture on behalf of @SerumInstIndia, I hereby reduce the price to the states from Rs 400 to Rs 300 per dose, effective immediately; this will save thousands of crores of state funds going forward. This will enable more vaccinations and save countless lives,” the company CEO Adar Poonawalla said on Wednesday, four days after defending his company’s pricing policy. He, however, did not comment on his company’s efforts to link Centre’s procurement price with that for states. The Centre’s procurement price was around Rs 150 per jab for the initial orders placed in January and March. Covishield price in India is higher than other countries such as South Africa and Sri Lanka (around Rs 390 per dose each), European Union $2.15 (around Rs 160) and UN initiative, Covax $3 (around Rs 225). With infection rising at a rapid pace, there is greater demand for vaccines and calls for the government to step up the drive. But manufacturers are unable to step up production.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sii-cuts-vax-price-25-in-philanthropic-gesture/articleshow/82300782.cms||---

While air conditioners couldn’t be switched on as part of the Covid-19 treatment protocol, the hospital did not have enough fans to serve its 680 infected patients. Thirty-year-old Revathi and her husband Rajesh, 40, who run Rainbow Care Systems, learned from a news article, which quoted ESI dean Dr M Raveendran as saying that the hospital needed around 300 fans, which he requested the well-wishers to donate to the facility. “We were planning to do some social service during the pandemic. So, we met the hospital dean in person on Tuesday to confirm the requirement and type of fans that were needed,” Rajesh said. When the dean confirmed that the hospital was in need of around 250 pedestal fans, the couple decided to contribute 100 fans. The couple didn’t want to delay their contribution as the covid-19 beds in the hospital were full. “Without wasting anytime, we approached a supplier, who quoted Rs 2.2 lakh for 100 fans. As we were slightly short of funds, I mortgaged a portion of my jewellery the same day and bought the fans for the hospital,” Revathi said. The couple said they have taken back their jewellery on Wednesday after repaying the loan amount. Hospital authorities were, meanwhile, surprised when the couple returned a few hours later with a truck load of fans. “We felt bad when we learned they had to mortgage their jewellery for this. We thought they would contribute only three or four fans,” the hospital dean said In a press statement, the hospital said they had contacted district collector S Nagarajan since the couple wanted to donate such a sizable number of fans. “He was also pleasantly surprised by the couple’s kind gesture and allowed us to accept the donation after speaking to them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/couple-pledge-gold-to-donate-100-fans-to-hosp/articleshow/82298479.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: SII fails to confirm state order for vaccination, may delay May 1 start||JAIPUR: The vaccination drive for those who are 18 years and above may get delayed as the state government has not received any confirmation or communication on the availability of vaccines from the Serum Institute of India (SII), the manufacturer of the drug. The state government had sought 3.75 crore vaccines and stated that it required nearly seven crore vaccines for giving two doses for 18+ beneficiaries. It is unlikely now that the state government will be able to start the vaccination drive for the category on May 1. On Wednesday, TOI spoke to health department officials regarding the status of the drive. “We have nearly 3.75 crore people in the age of 18 years and above. But we are yet to get any reply from SII. We are waiting for their communication and confirmation to prepare ourselves for the vaccine drive for this category,” said Siddharth Mahajan, secretary (medical and health), to TOI. Speaking on the state's requirement, health minister Raghu Sharma said, “We have nearly 3.75 crore people in that category, including health and frontline workers who are already being vaccinated. We need nearly seven crore vaccines to give them two doses. To start with, we have asked them to provide 3.75 crore vaccines.” “If we get it on time, we are determined to vaccinate the youth and would provide it free as announced by chief minister Ashok Gehlot,” he said. Since the SII has already said that they would first deliver vaccines to the Centre, it is unlikely that the state would get them in the next couple of days. Dr Raghuraj Singh, nodal officer (vaccination), said, “People may have started registering on Wednesday, but they will get the vaccination site option in the app only after we receive the vaccine. So, all those who have registered should keep checking the status. We have not yet identified vaccination sites as we don't have vaccines for this category, so far.” He said only after they receive further communication would things like the price they have to pay the manufacturer would be fixed. Rashi Sharma, a student who registered for the vaccination on Wednesday, said, “After I received the OTP and uploaded my ID, I was told I am registered, but I didn't receive the notification for the vaccination site.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sii-fails-to-confirm-state-order-for-vax-may-delay-may-1-start/articleshow/82299504.cms||Ashish Mehta

---||Pune||Concentrators on loan help save lives at home in Pune||PUNE: A group of NGOs and social organisations in the city have come together to loan oxygen concentrators to Covid-19 patients for 3-5 days at their homes for free. Caretakers and relatives of the patients are expected to look for a bed in hospitals in the meantime, shift the patient and return the concentrator which is then loaned to another needy patient. One such organisations, Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, which started the effort last year, said they had bought two concentrators to help patients with lung disease in 2019. After the pandemic struck, they bought 10 more machines and have helped hundreds of people. They get between 100-200 calls a day. Shaikh Imran Hussain of the organisation said they give out the concentrators only when the doctor prescribes it and if the patient’s relatives submit the Aadhaar number. “There are hundreds of calls and only so many concentrators. So, about 4-6 months ago, other NGOs also started looking at how best they can help and we suggested buying oxygen concentrators because the capacity to breathe is the biggest help we can provide even without medical help. Currently, I know about four NGOs who are providing 40-50 oxygen concentrators on loan to people for free. These machines are easy to use and portable. We also help the needy get ambulances, plasma, ventilator beds among others,” said Shaikh. Navin C’s mother’s oxygen level was down to 80 and there were hardly any oxygen supported beds available in the city. “The doctor told us that if we are able to get oxygen, he would treat her at home. One call to these people and I could get the machine. When we requested them to extend it for two more days, they did so for my mother. Now she is much better.” Another NGO is Khisal Jafri’s Ahlebait Covid Helpline. “We started four months ago and we have 10 oxygen concentrators and are expecting three more. We provide an oxygen supported bed for 1 to 3 days. We have a team of 10 doctors and some students of psychology who counsel the patients and relatives,” Jafri added. Santosh Pandit, who used Ahlebait’s helpline, said, “My friend’s 95-year-old father needed a hospital bed. We called the helpline. They immediately took the concentrator to his house. His father passed away peacefully at home in two days. We can’t thank the organisation enough,” Pandit said. Other organisations like Tamboli Trust and Dar-E-Arqam also provide oxygen for free.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/concentrators-on-loan-help-save-lives-at-home/articleshow/82298505.cms||Ardhra Nair

A CR official said, “The occupancy, both in Up and Down direction, is below 10 percent on Tejas Express trains.” The train runs between Mumbai and Goa which has also announced a lockdown. Maharashtra is also going to extend the lockdown after May 1. Karnataka too has announced lockdown because of which occupancy of trains that would be headed to the southern state, including the LTT-Mangalore Express, is expected to be low. On Monday, Central Railway cancelled almost 10 pairs of trains whose originating and terminating destinations were in Maharashtra.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: CBI team records sr cop’s statement on Deshmukh||New Delhi: The CBI is learnt to have recorded the statement of senior IPS officer Rashmi Shukla in connection with its probe into corruption and extortion related allegations levelled against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh by former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh.A CBI team, sources said, recorded Shukla’s statement in Hyderabad. Shukla was requested to elaborate on her report on the transfer-posting racket of last year. The move is being considered significant as the FIR lodged by the agency into the matter mentions part of Param Bir Singh’s 104-page-long complaint about Deshmukh and others having undue influence over transfer-postings of police personnel “thereby exercising undue influence over their performance”. Shukla was the commissioner of Maharashtra’s state intelligence department last year when it tapped telephones of influential people. Some of those whose numbers were intercepted were politically connected and their discussions regarding transfers and posting of police officers, including IPS officers, in exchange for money, was recorded. Shukla had subsequently submitted a report to the then DGP Subodh Jaiswal seeking an enquiry by the chief minister office. However, the government did not act on the report and Shukla then proceeded on deputation to the CRPF. Months later, the Mumbai Police registered an FIR to probe procedural lapses, leak of a confidential document and allegations of phone interceptions being illegal. Shukla was summoned by Mumbai Police but she didn’t appear citing Covid-19 crisis and sought a questionnaire. On April 21, the CBI had filed an FIR against Deshmukh under section 7 of the prevention of corruption Act and section 120B (criminal conspiracy). The agency conducted massive searches at multiple locations across Maharashtra, including at the office and residence of Deshmukh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cbi-team-records-sr-cops-statement-on-deshmukh/articleshow/82300773.cms||Raj Shekhar

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra records 985 Covid-19 deaths, highest in a day; CFR 1.5%||MUMBAI: While Covid-19 cases appear to have stabilised in Maharashtra, fatalities continue to rise alarmingly. On Wednesday, 985 deaths were reported—the highest addition so far. The cumulative death figures showed a higher 1,035, though, as the state added 50 additional fatalities to the tally over and above the toll reported on Wednesday. With this, deaths in the state totalled 67,214, up from 66,179 on Tuesday. The state has added 12,236 deaths this month—higher than 12,024 in September 2020, the peak of the first wave. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) added 220 deaths, of which 78 were from Mumbai and 142 from the rest of the region. Thane Municipal Corporation reported 92 deaths. The daily case fatality rate is on a steady rise—up to 1.5% from 0.8% last week. Officials say the surge in deaths is due to data reconciliation of the total deaths, of which 392 are from the past 48 hours while the rest are more than one week old. A state official said the deaths recorded by the state follow the big surge in cases seen in the past few weeks. “We expect the fatalities to remain as high as this or even surpass it. But a lot of deaths are old and not from the past 24 hours”. In Mumbai, of the 78 deaths, only 40 were of those with comorbidities, suggesting that a near-equal number without any underlying health conditions succumbed. Thirty-four of the 78 deaths were of people aged between 40 and 60 years. The state on Wednesday added 63,309 cases, taking the total caseload to 44.7 lakh. Mumbai, which was reporting under 4,000 cases for the past two days, recorded 4,926 on Wednesday taking the total to 6.4 lakh. According to data submitted in the state cabinet, the weekly CFR of the state is also on the rise. The CFR was 0.9% in the week that ended April 25, up from 0.5% a week before. Sindhudurg district reported a weekly CFR of 3.6% and Nanded 3.4%. Data shows it is not just the bigger districts such as Mumbai and Pune that are reporting deaths in big numbers. Even Nagpur and Aurangabad with a much lower population are clocking 80-90 deaths daily. In Nashik circle, Nashik and Ahmednagar remained the big contributors, while in Pune circle, 149 of the 217 deaths came from the Pune district. From the Akola circle, Yavatmal has reported most deaths. Dr Milind Kamble, dean of Government Medical College in Yavatmal, said the situation continues to be as grave as it was a month ago. The hospital is treating 614 patients on 577 beds. “What is worrying is young patients are coming late with a CT scan severity score of 17 and 18. They come by the 10th day and are impossible to salvage,” he said. He cited the example of a 45-year-old man who travelled nearly 100km to reach the hospital in a serious condition. “People who are symptomatic can progress very rapidly and hence they shouldn’t waste any time to seek care,” he said. On a positive note, the rate of increase in active cases in the state has also declined due to the increase in discharges. The state on Wednesday discharged 61,181 people, taking the total discharges to 37.3 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-records-985-deaths-highest-in-a-day-cfr-1-5/articleshow/82298510.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Pune||Pune: No summer break, colleges set to begin Std XII in June||PUNE: Junior colleges in Pune have decided against taking a summer break and will continue teaching to finish the remaining portion of Std XI. Most colleges said they will hold internal assessments in May and will try to start the next academic year for Std XII in June. FYJC admissions for 2020-21 were marred by delays with some happening till the last month. Seema Pandit, principal of Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce (BMCC), said they were lucky enough to get almost all their seats filled in the first two rounds and had the time to finish most of the portion. “Whatever is remaining is being completed now and within one week, the syllabus will be covered. We are planning to conduct an online examination in May using multiple choice questions and as soon as the exam ends, we will start with the next academic year. We are aiming for May-end, or June first week to start Std XII lectures. We want enough time to prepare our students for the board exams,” Pandit said, adding that they would try to squeeze in a 10-day break. P B Buchade, principal of Abasaheb Garware College, said they have decided to conduct a unit test at the end of May. “In most colleges, the classes had begun when 70% of the admissions were confirmed. So currently, everyone is at the last stage of syllabus completion. While we will see if the state issues any guidelines regarding Std XII, we also hope to start the Std XII lectures immediately afterwards,” he added. Pratha Joshi, a student at St. Mira’s College For Girls, said although she got admission in January and there was a huge syllabus to be completed, her teachers were extremely patient and helped the students go through all the topics. “Our lectures are still going on. We had one unit test last month and the next is scheduled for May 7 onwards. The syllabus is almost complete. While it was a challenge, considering the late admission, less time, a new concept of online classes and vast syllabus, teachers did not make us feel rushed while taking the classes. The college has not given any guidelines on when Std XII will start as they are waiting for government guidelines,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-summer-break-colleges-set-to-begin-std-xii-in-june/articleshow/82298515.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Mumbai||50% drop in Maharashtra registrations, revenue||Mumbai: The state government decision to roll back stamp duty cut from April 1 has led to a 50% drop in property registrations and stamp duty revenue in Greater Mumbai this month compared to March. Between April 1-28, only 8,754 property documents were registered in the city, while revenue collection as stamp duty was Rs 464 crore. In March, data shows 17,728 property documents were registered, which earned the state Rs 875 crore. Similarly, stamp duty revenue collected across Maharashtra in March and April showed a sharp difference. In March, the state earned Rs 9,067 crore as stamp duty when 2.13 lakh property documents were registered. In April (till Wednesday afternoon), the collection was Rs 1,103 crore from 83,843 registered documents. The main reason for a sharp drop, said Pankaj Kapoor of Liases Foras, which compiled this data, was the state decision not to extend stamp duty benefits. Last year, when the first wave of Covid-19 crippled the real estate market, the state government slashed stamp duty from 5% to 2% from September 1 till December 31, 2020. It was then marginally increased to 3% from January 1 till March 31, 2021. The duty cut led to a surge in apartment sales during between September 2020-March 2021. Developers urged the state to extend the benefit, but the government rolled back the duty to 5% from April. Kapoor said, “Stamp duty reduction was a big motivator for consumers to purchase properties. After it was rolled back, it took a big hit. The second pandemic wave this month further impacted the market.’’ “Government should have continued the incentive of stamp duty for some more time. Builders will now have to roll out more offers to entice customers,’’ he added. Market sources said many secondary transactions have happened over the past few months. M any investors, holding on to properties, offloaded stock to take advantage of the stamp duty cut.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/50-drop-in-maharashtra-registrations-revenue/articleshow/82300779.cms||Nauzer Bharucha
---||Hyderabad||Asymptomatic need not take test: Experts||Hyderabad: State health authorities on Wednesday said the current wave of Covid-19 is likely to wane by May-end. They also advised people not to rush to hospitals, occupy beds and create artificial scarcity. They also asked asymptomatic people not to get tested for the infection. “The next 3-4 weeks are crucial and people need to take extra care to avoid getting infected. Till then, people should defer all functions, marriages etc and also limit people at funerals. Currently, the situation is stable,” director, public health, Dr G Srinivasa Rao said on Wednesday. He reiterated the need to wear masks, maintain social distancing and hand hygiene at all times in addition to staying at home as much as possible. “Panic among people is leading to an artificial shortage of beds,” health authorities said. Around 85-90% Covid-19 patients do not need hospitalisation but many were looking for beds assuming that they would require in future, they added. “Don’t panic and rush to hospitals. Only, if the oxygen saturation is below 95, people need to go to hospitals,” the official said, adding that asymptomatic patients should not go and line up for Covid tests as well. On the other hand, he also alerted about patients coming to hospitals too late and succumbing within an hour. “Patients in districts should go to district hospitals. Patients are unable to take such long journeys and the district hospitals have the same facilities like Gandhi Hospital and TIMS,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/asymptomatic-need-not-take-test-experts/articleshow/82298996.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Vaccines short, jabs for 18-44 may be delayed in Telangana||HYDERABAD: On a day registration for Covid-19 vaccination for people aged between 18 and 45 opened, an aggressive rollout from May 1 is unlikely in Telangana due to confusion over availability of vaccine stocks. The state government has given instructions to local authorities for the roll-out of the vaccination programme on May 1, but has not issued clear guidelines for the programme so far. Sources said that the government is currently more focused on completing the second dose for people above the age of 45. “We are prepared to administer one million doses daily. But there are many shortcomings insofar as vaccine stocks are concerned. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao will review the situation in a day or two on the issue,” according to director of public health, Dr G Srinivasa Rao. Telangana has so far received 45.96 lakh doses of vaccine, of which 44.23 lakh have been utilised (including 0.53 per cent wastage). The state currently has a balance of 1.73 lakh doses. Another three lakh vaccine doses are expected to reach the state in next two days. “These are meant for people above 45 years. We are in touch with the vaccine companies as well,” the public health director said. Faced with shortage of vaccine doses, Telangana has largely limited the supply of vaccines to private hospitals, which are meant to be administered for people aged above 45 years. “More number of vaccine doses may be available only in June unless foreign vaccines are allowed into the country immediately,” according to top sources in the administration. Of the total doses, only 5 per cent of them are Covaxin jabs. The total vaccine production of Covishield and Covaxin is around seven crore doses per month. State government sources said that the current daily production is 23 lakh, which is not sufficient to serve even those in the age group of above 45. “In view of this (production capacity limitations), administering the second dose is top priority for the government,” a senior official said. It may be recalled that the state government had stopped the vaccination drive on March 17 across the state when many health centres reported that they did not have vaccine doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vaccines-short-jabs-for-18-44-may-be-delayed/articleshow/82298814.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Of these, the highest share—10,820—is from Mumbai. In the first 10 days of March, the state had conducted drives across its 36 districts to identify students who have fallen out of the formal education system during the pandemic year. There are 1.7 crore children aged between 3 and 14 in Maharashtra. According to the data, 7,806 children in the 6-14 age group had never been enrolled in school and 17,397 had been counted as dropouts due to irregular attendance in 2020-21. Students who do not attend school for one month or more are considered to have dropped out. Mumbai city and suburban districts together had 417 children who had never enrolled in school and 10,403 who had dropped out. Among the students who had dropped out of schools in the state, 288 said they were now employed as child labour and 1,212 couldn’t attend due to their special needs. The survey also presented migration data in 2020-21. As many as 33,390 stud-ents migrated from one district to another, and 14,084 moved outside the state, including 8,801 fr-om Mumbai. Meanwhile, 7,784 students came to Maharashtra. Experts feel the number of out-of-school children will be much larger than the state’s estimate. “It is unbelievable that only 288 children are employed as labourers in the entire state, when a 15-year-old estimate had pegged the number at 7 lakh,” activist Herambh Kulkarni said. “When an out-of-school survey was done in 2015, the department had found nearly 74,000 such students.  The numbers are only higher in Covid times as many students by the state’s estimate did not have access to digital learning.” A survey by Maharashtra State Council of Educational Research and Training, in collaboration with UNICEF, in July 2020 found that 59.8% of students had access to smartphones with internet. The lowest dropout numbers were in Bhandardara (19) and Washim (22). “This is impossible since these are tribal districts and access to learning would have been limited during the pandemic,” said Kulkarni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/in-pandemic-yr-over-25k-kids-out-of-school-in-maharashtra/articleshow/82299609.cms||Vinamrata Borwankar
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Now, many moving to districts in search of beds & treatment||HYDERABAD: The city had been witnessing an influx of patients from all over the state since the beginning of the second wave of Covid-19 but now a reverse migration has started taking shape. With the city’s health infrastructure currently overburdened, many are now heading to smaller towns hoping to find facilities. In one instance, a family went to Warangal to secure an ICU bed as they were unable to get one in Hyderabad. “We called every possible hospital but everywhere they asked us not to come. My father’s oxygen level was around 85 and we were in a hurry. Finally, with the help of some relatives we got to know of availability in Warangal and went there,” said Lasya V, the patient’s relative. “A fortnight back when it was still possible to get beds in small hospitals, we had two family members put up at a small hospital in Adialabad. We feared that we will not be able to afford treatment in Hyderabad,” admitted a patient’s relative who was turned back from Gandhi Hospital as it was a mild case. “This kind of reverse migration has begun now. The volume of patients is crumbling our already fragile healthcare infrastructure. After the first wave subsided, there was little time to prepare for the second wave, it was already predicted but we did almost nothing to improve our infrastructure,” said Dr P Raghu Ram, public health expert and director KIMS- Ushalakshmi centre for breast diseases. While earlier people were going to peripheral areas of the city, now many are going to Adilabad, Warangal and Nizamabad. “However, they are ones who have some kind of access in these districts, be it a relative or previous stay. Apart from the fact that there is no availability of resources (in the city), easy accessibility of doctors and cost are factors that drive this. For instance, getting an update of a Covid-19 patient in Hyderabad is very difficult as its only done on video at stipulated times, whereas in districts calling and getting an update is easier. Also access to drugs, oxygen and other is easier in districts,” said Dr Sanjeev Singh Yadav, national secretary for IMA’s Academy of Medical Specialities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/now-many-moving-to-districts-in-search-of-beds-treatment/articleshow/82298952.cms||Amrita Didyala

The empty tankers would be filled with liquid oxygen at Angul and return to the state. This is also the first oxygen express(empty) train to be started from South Central Railway. Indian Railways have started operating oxygen express trains on a mission mode to meet the oxygen requirement in different parts of the country. Under this initiative, tankers filled with liquid oxygen were being transported by the railways through Ro-Ro (Roll on– Roll Off) service. As part of this initiative, SCR has deployed empty oxygen express at the request of the Telangana government. “The zone had proactively identified the station capable of handling the Oxygen Express in the twin cities area. Immediately, on receipt of the request from the state government, the originating station as well as the green corridor to move the oxygen express was mapped till the destination station,” SCR said in a release. SCR said that green corridor was mapped to ensure faster movement of these tankers by taking into consideration various constraints such as height, curves, road over bridges, platform canopies, overhead equipment, among others along the route.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/oxygen-express-with-5-tankers-on-its-way-to-odisha-for-o2-fill/articleshow/82298985.cms||---

MSN group executive director Bharat Reddy said the company is ramping up capacities from the existing over 1 lakh dosage regimen per day, which translates into 5 lakh strips of different strengths of its brand Favilow, up to 6-8 lakh dosage regimen per day (around 30 lakh strips) by next month. For adults, the government has recommended a Favipiravir dosage of 1800 mg orally twice on the first day followed by 800 mg orally twice daily, up to a maximum of 14 days The capacity ramp-up will happen at its API and finished formulations facilities in Hyderabad, he said. MSN, which had launched the world’s most affordable generic Favipiravir 200mg at Rs 33 per tablet under the Favilow brand in August last year, has rolled out the 800mg version of Favipiravir at Rs 144 per tablet. “In the light of increasing Covid-19 cases in India, affordable treatment options are the need of the hour to flatten the curve.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Officials in a fix over vaccine availability||HYDERABAD: With no clarity over the availability of Covid-19 vaccines, the state government is now in a fix over starting vaccinations for those aged between 18 and 44 from May 1. Sources in the government said it is likely to be delayed with many factors to be considered. These include clarity on availability of vaccine doses, assistance from Centre, number of vaccinations centres, identification of migrant workers among others. Decisions over these matters have to be approved by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao who is currently in isolation after testing positive for Covid-19 one week back. The CM had earlier announced that everyone in the state, including migrant workers, will be given vaccines free of cost. The government had even planned to complete the vaccination drive withing three months, starting May and started negotiations with vaccine manufacturers such as Barat Biotech to procure doses. Official sources said that as of now, the government had been administering vaccines to one to two lakh persons every day and that 43 lakh persons over the age of 45 had been vaccinated since administration began in the state. They said that if the government intends to start vaccination persons below the age of 45, it would need another two lakh vaccines per day. Bharat Biotech had reportedly informed the chief secretary that they would get back to the government over allocation of vaccines. Officials said the current allocation by the Centre would not suffice the state’s requirement. The government is also waiting for the Centre’s decision on financial help to states on vaccination to people aged between 18 and 44 years. Officials pointed out that the state plans to administer vaccines through government hospitals and primary health centres but said staff at these hospitals are currently occupied with Covid-19 treatment. They also pointed out that while the chief minister had promised to vaccinate migrant workers, there was no data available on their current numbers. “As on June 20, there were 3.5 lakh migrant workers in the state but these numbers keep changing. We have asked district collectors to identify migrant workers in their jurisdiction and inform us,” Telangana labour department commissioner Ahmed Nadeem told TOI. As per unofficial estimates, there are around six lakh migrant workers in organised and unorganised sector. While some CMO officials said the government wants to vaccinate everyone, this statement has been questioned by those in the health department. “As of now, Centre has allowed to give vaccine to people above 18 as vaccine trials were conducted on people above 18 years of age. How can the CMO say vaccine for all?” asked a senior official of the state health department. Meanwhile, government officials said the chief minister would resume duties within the new few days and announce the policy decisions on the vaccination drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/officials-in-a-fix-over-vaccine-availability/articleshow/82298885.cms||Koride Mahesh

The medical oxygen plant (MOP) technology, developed by DRDO for on-board oxygen generation for LCA, Tejas, by DEBEL, DRDO, would now help in fighting the current crisis of oxygen for Covid-19 patients. The oxygen plant has been designed to produce 1,000 litres per minute (LPM). The system could cater to 190 patients at a flow rate of 5 LPM and charge 195 cylinders per day. Transfer of technology has been done to Tata Advanced Systems Limited, Bengaluru and Trident Pneumatics Pvt. Ltd., Coimbatore, who would be producing 380 plants for installation across various hospitals in the country. As many as 120 plants of 500 LPM capacity would be produced by industries working with CSIR’s Indian Institute of Petroleum, Dehradun. Medical oxygen plant technology is capable of generating oxygen with 93±3% concentration, which could be directly supplied to hospital beds or used to fill oxygen cylinders. It utilises pressure swing adsorption technique and molecular sieve technology to generate oxygen directly from atmospheric air, as per DRDO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/drdo-to-set-up-380-plants-for-o2-production/articleshow/82298969.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Private hospitals unlikely to give vax to 18+||HYDERABAD: While several citizens hoping to enrol for Covid vaccination from May 1 were left dejected with the crashing of CoWin website on Wednesday, there is a big question mark whether the drive will actually begin for the 18-45 year category in the state in the first place. Private hospitals already have a long waitlist of beneficiaries awaiting second dose of Covid vaccine. Most hospital representatives TOI spoke to said that they have the infrastructure for administering the vaccines kept ready, but are awaiting a word from either the Centre or the state. “Currently, the Centre and the states have not entered into an MoU for the vaccine allocation. We have no information on when or how will the allocation be made to private hospitals. Vaccination will not begin at our centre from May 1 for sure,” a representative of a corporate hospital in Gachibowli told TOI. “As per our understanding 60% of the doses will be allocated to the Centre, while 30% will be given to states. The states are likely to supply to state-run hospitals. As of now, we don’t know whether the allocation will come from Centre or state,” said a representative from another hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pvt-hospitals-unlikely-to-give-vax-to-18/articleshow/82298876.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Hyderabad||Telangana to concentrate efforts on testing symptomatic||HYDERABAD: With the state’s new plan to focus on testing on symptomatic persons, daily testing for Covid-19 came down by around 20,000 in the previous 24-hour cycle. The state health department conducted 82,270 tests on Wednesday, fewer than the over 1 lakh tests which were taking place for past ten days. Health department had increased testing by double, to around 40,000, just prior to the second wave of infections. Now, as part of the revised plan, the state has set a target of 50,000 antigen tests per day, as reported by TOI on Monday. Health department director Dr Srinivas Rao has urged people not to rush to testing centres as symptomatic persons are in urgent need of testing as compared to those who suspect they may have contracted the virus. Despite shortage of antigen testing kits, the state has managed to conduct close to 1.3 crore tests till now. World Health Organisation has set a benchmark of 140 tests per million a day. The state has so far conducted 342,519 tests per million. State health authorities have said that some people were coming in for tests repeatedly and that this should be avoided as there is a possibility of contracting infection at the testing centre. The state currently has a capacity to do only around 35,000 tests while private labs and hospitals are not permitted to do antigen tests. Currently, there are 20 RT-PCR testing centres under government and close to 60 under the private sectors. Government also has over 1,000 antigen testing centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-to-concentrate-efforts-on-testing-symptomatic/articleshow/82298843.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||India||Most states postpone May 1 vaccination plan||NEW DELHI: May 1 was to be a ‘hope day’ for the country, beginning a big bang inoculation drive for the youth. But, on Wednesday, when the registration process began, most states put off their plans, faced with vaccine shortage while many beneficiaries could not get dates for inoculation. Even as thousands logged in to register for vaccination, many states went back to the drawing board, not knowing when they could begin the drive. In Maharashtra, the drive may now begin only by May-end, while UP may do a token drive on May 1. MP has decided to put off vaccination for 60+ and 45+ for two days so that the drive for the 18-44 age group could begin on May 1. “A vaccination schedule will be announced once planning for procurement of vaccine stocks is done,” said Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal had said on Monday the state government has approved the purchase of 1.3 crore vaccines. Sources in the government said the shots are yet to arrive and it is likely that the third phase of the inoculation drive might not start in a big way on May 1. Beneficiaries in Delhi also had to deal with technical glitches while trying to register — from not getting OTPs to not being allowed to register and inability to upload documents and scheduling an appointment for vaccination. In Goa too, many of those who managed to register themselves, could not get appointments. In TN, many users complained of glitches in accessing and registering themselves on the Co-Win app. Complaints poured in from Kerala too. Many states like Bihar, Odisha, Assam, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, TN, Kerala, Goa, Rajasthan, HP have placed orders with pharma companies but are not sure if stocks would reach them on time putting the May 1 plan in a limbo. Gujarat government will release its revised schedule once it receives dates for arrival of vaccines. In Bengal, beneficiaries could register but no appointment dates have been provided. Meanwhile, adding to the list of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, Congress on Wednesday said Punjab may not be able to roll out new vaccination in time because of shortage of stock. The party said Punjab wrote to the SII for vaccines but the state has not received any reply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/most-states-postpone-may-1-vaccination-plan/articleshow/82301455.cms||---
---||Pune||Rural teachers worry about students, hope for early decision on syllabus||Pune: School teachers in rural areas, where very few students have access to online classes, are wondering if the government will continue with a 25% syllabus cut for the 2021-22 academic year too. Sahebrao Mahajan, a Zilla Parishad teacher from rural Thane, said while students attended all lectures in Std VIII, there was no annual examination. Mahajan said in Std IX, the classes were held online, but it is not as effective as physical classes. Once again, no examinations were held and these students are being promoted to Std X. “Now, if the situation in the state does not improve, the first few months will again be gone in online teaching. Hence, we want the government and education department to decide in advance, at least for Std X and XII students, about a syllabus cut. If there is a syllabus cut, teachers can plan their lectures accordingly, but the decision must be communicated well in advance,” he added. Santosh Musale, a ZP school teacher from Jalna, said while lack of offline classes will impact students in higher classes, the entry-level classes, which will be affected the most. “At least these children have got knowledge of language, mathematics and English till class VII. But what about students who were in Std I last year and now have been promoted to Std II. If the situations continue these students will go to Std III without the ability to read the alphabet or have a concept of numbers. In normal circumstances, it takes almost a month or two to make these children sit through the entire school day. Their hands and fingers are not used to holding a pencil and writing so we hold their hands and make them write. None of it was possible during the lockdown. An entire lot of students is being promoted with no skills,” Musale added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rural-teachers-worry-about-students-hope-for-early-decision-on-syllabus/articleshow/82298527.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Mumbai||Mental health helpline rings off the hook with 70k calls in Covid times||MUMBAI: Over 70,000 people across India dialled a mental health helpline in the last financial year, indicating the profound impact that the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown has had on people's psychological state. The Mpower helpline, which has an ongoing tie-up with the Government of Maharashtra and the BMC, received maximum calls from people between 26 to 40 years of age. Besides employees of corporate groups, teachers and farmers also sought help for mental health issues. Psychiatrists recounted a case where a man in his mid-twenties reached out to the helpline with increasing depressive thoughts. He was finding it difficult to overcome a heartbreak. Trapped at home during lockdown and conflict with family made him feel suicidal. He was advised medication and psychotherapy. After extensive work on grief therapy, his symptoms have reduced. In another case, a young student reported having constant thoughts of his arm being cut off and facing disability for life. He was suffering from an obsessive compulsive disorder. The helpline team referred him for medication and Exposure Response Prevention (ERP) therapy which helped him gain control over obsessive thoughts. He is now doing better and is studying for competitive exams. "Nearly 25% of our callers reported stress and anxiety, whether it was anxiety related to career growth, health, exams, the pandemic or problems at the workplace," said a spokesperson. About 8% of calls were about relationships, which included concerns with partners or conflicts with family. Ten percent of calls pertained to depression and loneliness. A large number of patients also called up with anger management and addiction problems. In one of the cases the helpline received, a man pursuing his MBA while working in the sales sector reported feelings of work stress, self doubt and constantly feeling less qualified compared to colleagues. He thought that people around him were judging him for the way he walked or spoke to others. Due to overtime and working on holidays, he was experiencing burnout. He couldn’t recall the last time that he was cheerful and when stressed, he would skip meals and sleep for just five to six hours at night. He was diagnosed with Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and therapy. Seventy percent of all callers on the helpline in the past year were male. "In the 2020 lockdown, there was a lot of anxiety but still a lot of optimism. What seems to have changed this time is the feeling of hopelessness and acceptance of fate. There is numbness setting in about how long we can go on this way," said child and adolescent psychiatrist Dr Sapna Bangar. With increasing instances of younger children catching Covid, there is a whole new spectrum of anxiety among parents with regard to child mortality, she added. Information overload via social media is not helping either. "In patients already suffering from mental health conditions, round-the-clock flow of news like insufficient hospital beds or difficulty in finding oxygen cylinders is exacerbating their condition," said Dr Ambrish Dharmadhikari, head psychiatrist at Mpower Foundation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mental-health-helpline-rings-off-the-hook-with-70k-calls-in-covid-times/articleshow/82299621.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Goa||AIFF likely to keep relegation on hold in I-League||Panaji: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) will not relegate Neroca FC to the second division, despite finishing at the bottom in this season’s I-League. Neroca had just eight points from 14 matches in their kitty this season, two less than Indian Arrows – who are immune from relegation – and seven behind Chennai City FC. Unlike previous editions, the I-League was held at a centralised venue with a different format that saw the 11 teams play each other once and then get classified in different groups. The top group of six teams fought for the title, while the remaining five were left to save the drop. AIFF president Praful Patel has called for a meeting of all stakeholders – executive committee members and presidents/general secretaries of all state associations – on Friday where technical director Isac Doru will make a presentation regarding the suspension of relegation for this season. “The technical director has recommended that for this year, due to the pandemic, there should not be any relegation in the I-League. He will make a presentation explaining the thinking and the AIFF (executive committee) will take a decision (at a separate meeting),” a senior AIFF official told TOI on Thursday. Even before the conclusion of the I-League, clubs like Chennai City and Neroca had formally requested the AIFF to keep relegation on hold for this season. “Many clubs had written,” said the official. “We will look at this from a technical point of view. Let the technical director make his presentation.” If AIFF agrees with its technical director that there should not be any relegation in the I-League this season, it will not be the first time that teams finishing in the relegation zone have been allowed to continue. In 2015-16, Aizawl were marked to go down after finishing in the relegation zone but were still retained. Churchill Brothers FC were relegated from I-League in 2017-18 but the former champions were allowed to play in the top division since there was no representative from Goa. Goan powerhouses like Salgaocar FC, Dempo SC and Sporting Clube de Goa had all earlier pulled out, protesting the AIFF’s roadmap that proposed to make Indian Super League (ISL) the top-tier league and relegated I-League to the second division.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aiff-likely-to-keep-relegation-on-hold-in-i-league/articleshow/82317310.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The case was registered after an official from the BMC Gardens department carried out a probe based on a complaint it has received last June on Twitter. A non-cognizable offence had been registered on July 1, 2020. Later the police sought permission from the metropolitan magistrate court to probe the matter, and accordingly, the FIR was registered against the coffee shop owner on Monday. Last year on June 25, civic officials got a tip-off on Twitter that the owner of a coffee shop had put up metal sheets around a tree and poisoned it. “A probe revealed that the tree had withered,” said a police officer. The accused has been booked under MaharashtraTree Protection and Preservation Act. No arrest has been made yet.

---||Chandigarh||Centre allocates 20 MT oxygen quota to UT, as much to PGI||Chandigarh: The administration has set up a control room in UT health department to keep a track of oxygen availability and other needs of hospitals and take immediate remedial steps. The Centre has allocated 40 metric tonnes (MT) per day of liquid oxygen for Chandigarh, including 20 MT for PGI. Of the 40 MT, 20 MT will be provided from Lindee Dehradun to PGI, Chandigarh, and another 20 MT from Inox plant at Barotiwala, Solan, to Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMH), Sector 16, Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, and Covid hospital in Sector 48. “To ensure regular and uninterrupted supply of oxygen to both government and private hospitals, it has been decided that sufficient quantity of medical oxygen, out of the 20 MT quota, will be provided to the private vendor for the purpose of refilling cylinders,” said Yashpal Garg, nodal officer for oxygen supplies in UT.“At present, there is one private vendor. Efforts are being made to include a few more. Most probably, two to three more private vendors will be included by Thursday for refilling of cylinders with medical oxygen,” Garg added. Recently, the UT administration had submitted its report before the Punjab and Haryana high court. The report stated that oxygen compressed into liquid form is stored in cryogenic tanks set up at PGI, Chandigarh, GMCH-32, Sector 48 hospital and GMH-16. “The government of India has provided three oxygen generators. These have been installed at GMCH-32, Sector 48 hospital, GMH-16,” it added. These PSA oxygen generators separate oxygen from compressed air by way of a process known as “pressure swing absorption” and all three are functional.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/centre-allocates-20-mt-oxygen-quota-to-ut-as-much-to-pgi/articleshow/82298545.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The APMC has also imposed Rs 44,000 fine on them. Madhukant Garad, the APMC secretary, said, “We had asked all agents to not indulge in illeaggal practices. However, these three commission agents still packed the Karnataka fruit in Devgad ‘Alphonso’ boxes and put them up for the sale. Based on the input received, we seized all boxes before they could sell any.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/apmc-fines-3-agents-over-fake-alphonso/articleshow/82298566.cms||Sandip Dighe

Seeing his musician friend slip into depression, Dr Sadashiv Bhole came up with the idea of bringing the guitar of Sandeep Baraskar, who was admitted at Seven Star Hospital. Dr Bhole, who is one of the directors of the hospital, prodded Baraskar to hold jamming session which soon became a superhit in the Covid ward. As Baraskar played the guitar, some patients and staff members, including head of supply chain Nitin Zerbade, took the mike singing melodies of Kishore Kumar, Mohammad Rafi and Kumar Sanu from the 80s to 90s. “I tested positive on April 9. A lot of weird thoughts clouded my mind for the first four days. It was difficult to live those moments. Dr Bhole asked me to me admitted. Two days after admission, he asked me to call the guitar from home,” Baraskar said. Baraskar was reluctant but soon got his guitar, laptop and speaker making the mood musical. “An announcement was made calling entries for performance. Most patients came as audience. That evening, within an hour, all my weakness was gone. All patients congratulated me and said they felt good,” said Baraskar. Taken by surprise, the patients recorded the event on their phones and shared with their family members. A day later, another session was held on the next floor in the ICU. “Patients came up with demands like bhajans or Hindi songs of their choice,” he said. The activity not just rejuvenated everyone but also helped Baraskar get early discharge. “I had to complete five days but they discharged me on the fourth as I was doing well,” he said. Baraskar thanked the doctors for forcing him to eat food and medicine. “I hardly feel weak now,” he said. Dr Shantala Bhole, a gynaecologist at the hospital, is in-charge of recreational activities for patients and staff. “It was a wonderful experience. Music has a healing power. It makes you forget pain. The activity videos too were popular. Staff members feel motivated. We are also giving a sapling to all patients. We keep on doing creative activities,” she said. Dr Mohan Nerker, the hostipal’s Covid unit head, said such events do create a sense of well-being. “Patients stay isolated and boredom sets in. Music is a remedy. Patients were happy as they may not have expected it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/music-sessions-in-hosps-covid-ward-help-patients-staff-detox/articleshow/82299650.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Nagpur||Wardha co may start Rem production from Saturday||Nagpur: Even as Union minister Nitin Gadkari said that the Wardha-based Genetek Life Sciences would start manufacturing Remdesivir from Wednesday, it’s likely to come out with its first batch on May 1. Gadkari made the announcement while inaugurating the 100-bed Covid hospital at KT Nagar along with leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis and MLC Parinay Fuke on Tuesday. However, the company’s director Mahendra Kshirsagar clarified that they would be receiving the raw material from Hyderabad-based Hetero Drugs Limited on Wednesday. “It would take a couple of days for testing the material, which is a long and complicated procedure. We don’t have any idea about the quantity of raw material we would be receiving. By Saturday, we would probably be able to produce the first batch of 30,000 Remdesivir vials, provided all test results are according to the parameters and there’s sufficient supply of raw material,” he told TOI. Elaborating on the possible plan, Kshirsagar said they have developed a new technology at their Sevagram MIDC plant through which they can produce a whopping 2.5 lakh Remdesivir vials per day that would take care of the entire country. “We produce injections for CT scan and MRI machines and have used this technology on other products successfully. This technology is called ‘Form Fill Seal’ from where Remdesivir would be made available in plastic vials, instead of glass. It needs numerous testing, compatibility and stability that would take another two to three months,” said Kshirsagar. Earlier, Gadkari announced that Nagpur district would be receiving 110MT oxygen from the Bhilai plant from the earlier 60MT, and SAIL would be providing 30MT. Even Inox Company would be setting up a plant for producing 80MT from the air. “We will be receiving 140MT oxygen, but faced problems of transportation as four trucks went back to Delhi and Chhattisgarh. Now, Pyare Khan came to our rescue by providing tankers for the purpose. He would be monitoring their movements. We’re also receiving tankers from Bellari and Visakhapatnam.” The minister has also requested VNIT director Pramod Padole to send a team to provide technical support to various oxygen plants in the city, for repairs and other purposes. “US-based businessman Dr Shah has promised 1,100 oxygen concentrators which we plan to bring to the city through Air India, free of cost. We’re trying our best to provide oxygen and ventilators to all parts of Vidarbha, including Sironcha,” said Gadkari. Kshirsagar told TOI that ‘chemical-physio instrumental testing’ would be conducted on the Remdesivir formulation and thoroughly checked on various parameters. “We also conduct a sterility test on the product at our in-house facility which takes many days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/wardha-co-may-start-rem-production-from-saturday/articleshow/82311876.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Mumbai||Inspector Sunil Mane abducted SUV owner, handed him to killers: NIA||MUMBAI: National Investigation Agency (NIA), probing the murder of Scorpio owner Mansukh Hiran, has learnt that inspector Sunil Mane posed as ‘inspector Tawde’, kidnapped him in his car and snatched his mobile phone, and handed him over to the killers at Hill View hotel at Ghodbunder Road in Thane on March 4 night. Mane, the fourth policeman to be arrested in the case was produced before special NIA court on Wednesday and remanded to NIA custody till May 1. NIA is probing the planting of gelatine sticks inside a car outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house on February 25 and murder of Mansukh. While seeking Mane’s custody, it submitted that a statement was recorded of a person to whom Mane allegedly discussed disposing of Mansukh’s body. NIA told court it had seized documents from Mane’s house and his security office at Andheri and recorded statements of accused and witnesses, confirming that at the time of Hiran’s killing, Mane had taken Mansukh’s mobile phone, switched it off, and kept it in his bag. Special public prosecutor Prakash Shetty sought Mane’s further custody. Mane’s counsel Aditya Gore opposed extension of remand, saying witnesses’ statements were not admissible as evidence. He submitted that Mane’s confrontation with “incriminating documents, call data records and co-accused” could be done while he was out on bail. NIA said there were seven calls between Sachin Waze and Mane before the murder. While two were missed calls, NIA suspects five were made to plan the conspiracy. Like Waze, Mane had an alibi on March 4, when he kept his mobile phone on in his Kandivli crime branch office and reached Thane to pick up Mansukh. Later, he told a junior to pick up his phone from office and send it to his house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mane-had-posed-as-tawde-handed-over-hiran-to-killers-in-mumbai-nia/articleshow/82299636.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Cloud of doubt over vaccination drive for 18+ from May 1||GANDHINAGAR: Although chief minister Vijay Rupani has announced that the vaccination drive of all persons older than 18 years will begin as scheduled on May 1, health department officials are concerned as the state government has not received the necessary stock of vaccine doses yet. Registration for the vaccination drive started on Wednesday. Rupani recently claimed that the state government has placed orders for 1.50 crore doses. However, officials said the government is yet to receive any stock of vaccines. A key source playing a significant role in managing the vaccination drive said, “Although we are among the first few states to have placed orders for the vaccine, we are yet to receive any supply schedule from the manufacturers and the Union government. We fear it may not be possible to take up the drive on a large scale in the first few days. In the meantime, the government has planned to increase vaccination centres to meet the increased demand.” Reliable sources said, “At present, the state government has 7.9 lakh doses of Covid vaccines which have been received from Centre for the 45+ age group. We are yet to receive fresh stock for that group as well.” For the 18 to 45 years group, the Gujarat government estimated a requirement of 6.50 crores doses (two per eligible citizen). State has not met 5 lakh per day target yetThe Union government had set a target of five lakh vaccine doses per day for the 45+ age group. However, the state government has not been able to meet the target on even a single day. The maximum number of doses administered in a single day was 4.90 lakh. A shortage of vaccines doses and medical staff engaged in other Covid control activities has meant that the state has been able to administer between 50,000 and one lakh doses on a daily basis during the past month. Day 1: Few could register for jabsThousands from Gujarat awaited April 28 to get themselves registered for the Covid vaccine as the only sure-shot way to remain safe. However, to their dismay, they could not get themselves registered despite repeated attempts. Senior state health department officials did not divulge the figure of registration on Day 1, but few could get themselves registered. “The registration would take place once we get the vaccine delivery schedule. A new date will be announced soon for the same. We are hopeful that we would be on schedule,” said a senior official. Govt withdraws 108 policy for Dhanwantri hospitalAfter AMC, the state government has issued a directive withdrawing its policy of admitting only those patients brought in by 108 ambulance at the new Dhanwantri Covid Hospital. Patients’ kin will have to obtain token from outside the hospital from 8am onwards, having submitted Covid and other reports. Patients whose oxygen levels are below 92 will be prioritised. Tokens will be issued only for vacant beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cloud-of-doubt-over-vax-drive-for-18-from-may-1/articleshow/82299717.cms||Kapil Dave
---||Pune||Contractor held for woman’s death||Pune: The Airport police on Wednesday arrested a labour contractor, Santosh Rathod (32), on the charge of bludgeoning a woman to death at Lohegaon on Monday midnight over a previous dispute.  “We showed photographs of her smashed face to the local residents and construction labourers and this helped us to establish her identity as Anita Rathod (28), a resident of Lohegaon,” said senior inspector Gajanan Pawar. Pawar said, “Information collected from people known to Anita revealed that she was married and was working as a labour at a construction site when she entered into a relationship with contractor Rathod, who hails from Solapur and currently resides at Lohegaon. She left Rathod over some dispute and got friendly with another man. When Rathod learnt about her friendship with another man, he tried to woo her back, but in vain.” “Rathod, during questioning, told police that he had met Anita on Monday night and chatted with her for some time,” he said. He then lured her to accompany him for some work, took her to the field and throttled her to death. He then smashed her face with stone and took to heels,” he added. “We arrested him on the charge of committing murder and destroying evidence under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC),” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/contractor-held-for-womans-death/articleshow/82298552.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Tapan-da, the go-to bookseller for Ray, Sen and Smita Patil, succumbs to Covid||Kolkata: One of Satyajit Ray’s favourite haunts in central Kolkata was this “hole in the wall” bookstore in the Grand Hotel arcade on Chowringhee. It might be difficult to visualise now, but the larger-than-life Ray would sit on a wooden stool outside the store and go on browsing foreign film publications to his fill; buying some and placing orders for some more. The man, who knew of Ray’s choices, is no more. Tapan Chatterjee — known to generations of film directors and scholars of film studies as Tapan-da — passed away at a Covid hospital in Howrah. Foreign Publishers Agency was set up in 1941 by his uncle and Chatterjee came as a young 19-year-old boy from Bankura, to manage the business. The store dealt only in foreign publications and specialised in books on films. It was a one-stop shop for anyone who wanted to buy rare books and magazines on films. Much like Ray, Mrinal Sen, Tapan Sinha and Rituparna Ghosh were regulars at the store, looking for Tapan-da to help them find what they were looking for. “Ray was a regular buyer of Sight and Sound, Cineaste and American Cinematographer from this store. He would come to Tapan-da with his list of books. Tapan-da was self-taught. He read the books at the store voraciously and gained rare knowledge that enabled him to engage in conversations with the city’s top intellectuals,” said Ashish Bhattacharya, his cousin and present owner of the bookstore. “Tapan-da was a much sought out person by Govind Nihalani and Smita Patil, who would buy from here,” Bhattacharya added. Ray’s son, filmmaker Sandip Ray, was sad. He would often accompany his father to the store and would browse and buy too. “Those days were different, such rare foreign publications were not easily available and hence this bookstore stood out despite its modest look. My father was a regular here and Tapan-da was only too happy to assist. They shared a rare bonding,” Ray reminisced. The senior Ray started visiting the store in the 60s and made acquaintance with Chatterjee from 1974 onwards after the young man started managing the store by himself. The famous picture of Ray sitting on the stool outside engrossed in reading was taken by his photographer, Nemai Ghosh, who too is no more. Chatterjee was 66. He had taken the first dose of vaccine but still contracted the disease. He started having multi-organ failure at the ESI Hospital Balitikuri and died on Tuesday afternoon. He is mourned by hundreds of booklovers, who say that he encouraged reading to such an extent that he didn’t mind taking out his accounts books and keeping a record of “pore diye diyo biota nao.” One such is writer-critic Shamik Bandyopadhyay, who said in a heartfelt tribute: “Tapan was so kind and generous. There were times when I ran up bid arrears. More than half my life I have been without a job and never had the patience to wait to procure a book till I had the means to pay for it. Tapan was always a kind, trustful saviour.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tapan-da-the-go-to-bookseller-for-ray-sen-and-smita-patil-succumbs-to-covid/articleshow/82298610.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

He submitted a memorandum to the minister on behalf of the employees and FPS dealers and said distribution of rice through fair price shops was inevitable every month despite a surge in Covid-19 cases. The FPS dealers’ association had said that several dealers died of Covid-19 and many of them were still under home isolation. Putting up a brave front, the staff and FPS dealers had extended their services to ration card holders during these testing times. Stating that while health, police, revenue and municipal department employees were treated as frontline warriors and were being given Covid-19 vaccine on a priority basis, he said there was a need to declare even those working in civil supplies corporation and FPS dealers as frontline warriors. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/civil-supplies-staff-want-frontline-worker-tag/articleshow/82300792.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Last week, a woman had committed suicide by jumping from the fifth floor of this building, two days after testing positive.The nine-storey building has been converted into Covid facility where about 900 patients are under treatment at present. All are on oxygen support. Charansinh Gohil, additional collector and in-charge of the facility, said, “Some patients who are on oxygen support may suffer from O2-induced delirium and develop suicidal tendency. So, we have fixed this net. It can come handy in case fire also and save any patient who jumps off due to anxiety.” After the woman’s suicide, a decision was taken to install a net on the fourth and first floors. According to sources, at least four Covid-19 patients in Rajkot district have committed suicide in April.

The registration opened 4pm onwards on Wednesday, but the portal said, “Minimum age limit for bookings is 45+” Many residents faced problems in getting bookings for vaccination slot, though the portal is taking registrations. Kamaljit Kaur of Phase VII, Mohali, said, “I wanted to get a booking, but the portal did not respond as I am below 45 years.”Another Mohali resident, Manpreet Kaur, said, “I was able to register on the portal, but when proceeded to book a slot, it did not respond as it is still accepting bookings for above 45 years age group.” In Chandigarh too, those trying for registration for jabs from May 1 were left staring at the application. While some complained that the application crashed, others could register only after many attempts. However, they could not get any slot. “I have been trying since morning and the message I got was: ‘Currently registration is allowed for citizens older than 45 years only’,” said a resident of Sector 42. She said, “I am unable to register either through the website or Arogya Setu.”Amit Garg, a UT resident, said, “I tried a number of times in vain. When the traffic will slow down at midnight, I will try again.”It is not the first time that the Co-Win app crashed or was unable to register a new beneficiary. “As the system is not new, it should not have crashed. But often due to high traffic, the system can get slow. Besides, the application is only for registration at the moment and not for slots,” said a PGI doctor. In Panchkula, too, residents faced the same problem. “I was unable to register on Co-Win portal despite multiple attempts,” said Garima Arora, 24, a medical student who lives in Sector 8.Naina Garg, 29, a resident of Amravati Enclave, said, “As per the directions of MHA, I tried to register on both Co-Win and Arogya Setu, but none worked.” Vikram Sinha, 34, a resident of Sector 25, Panchkula, said, “I want to take the vaccine as soon as possible, but the link provided by the government is crashing.

---||Thane||Maharashtra curbs to continue till May 15 as daily Covid toll nears 1,000||MUMBAI: The state cabinet on Wednesday unanimously decided to extend the lockdownlike restrictions in Maharashtra for another fortnight, that is, from May 1 to 15, after the current fortnight of curbs ends at the end of this month. The decision came on a day the state recorded 985 Covid deaths, its highest daily toll since the start of the pandemic. While public health minister Rajesh Tope said all cabinet ministers were unanimous that the curbs be extended to check the spread of Covid-19, NGOs working for the poor and representatives of the retail sector and restaurants said the restrictions were having a serious adverse impact and they had expected some relief. Tope told mediapersons that though the number of daily Covid-19 cases in the state seems to have stabilised to 60,000-odd against the prediction of 70,000-plus cases, “I pray to God that hopefully this may be the peak and declining graph should start.” He said all the curbs would be extended for 15 days. Help informal sector: NGOs to stateThe state cabinet on Wednesday unanimously decided to extend the lockdown-like restrictions in Maharashtra for 15 days. The official order on the extension is expected in a day or two, state officials said. Minister for revenue Balasaheb Thorat also favoured extension of curbs. “To prevent the spread of Covid, lockdown-like restrictions must be extended for the next two weeks,” he said. But groups working with the poor were unhappy and said better relief measures were required. “Informal workers have been the worstaffected. As many do not have ration cards, relief has not reached them,” said Ulka Mahajan from Sarvahara Jan Andolan. “Also, the government has offered subsidies to segments of informal workers like construction workers, but many are unregistered and do not have bank accounts,” Mahajan added. “The government needs to set up food kitchens offering ready meals in slums. The free ration scheme and Shiv bhojan thalis are not enough,” said Bilal Khan from the Ghar Bachao Ghar Banao Andolan. Industry groups said they were hoping for some relaxations in Mumbai. Viren Shah from the Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association said, “We are hoping for some reopening of the retail sector in Mumbai, where cases have gone down, and also for a package for the retail sector.” Indian Merchants’ Chamber president Rajiv Poddar said, “We can understand the need to extend restrictions since the pandemic is still severe, but perhaps they can increase attendance in private offices to at least 30%.” The restaurant sector will face more closures if restrictions continue for much longer, said Shivanand Shetty, president of the Indian Hotel and Restaurants Association. “Home deliveries of food items are only helping to keep the kitchens open and to offset losses by 15-20%,” he said. “Given the high rents, in the absence of a relief package, many restaurants will have no option but to shut down,” he said. Hoteliers and retailers said around of the 35% establishments have not opened since the first lockdown. Now, in the second wave, those owning the premises or those who can afford rent are functioning with just 25% staff for the sake of home deliveries and takeaways, which contribute little to the overall income. “Paying taxes and surviving will be a tough task.

The decision came on a day the state recorded 985 Covid deaths, its highest daily toll since the start of the pandemic. While public health minister Rajesh Tope said all cabinet ministers were unanimous that the curbs be extended to check the spread of Covid-19, NGOs working for the poor and representatives of the retail sector and restaurants said the restrictions were having a serious adverse impact and they had expected some relief. Tope told mediapersons that though the number of daily Covid-19 cases in the state seems to have stabilised to 60,000-odd against the prediction of 70,000-plus cases, “I pray to God that hopefully this may be the peak and declining graph should start.” He said all the curbs would be extended for 15 days. Help informal sector: NGOs to stateThe state cabinet on Wednesday unanimously decided to extend the lockdown-like restrictions in Maharashtra for 15 days. The official order on the extension is expected in a day or two, state officials said. Minister for revenue Balasaheb Thorat also favoured extension of curbs. “To prevent the spread of Covid, lockdown-like restrictions must be extended for the next two weeks,” he said. But groups working with the poor were unhappy and said better relief measures were required. “Informal workers have been the worstaffected. As many do not have ration cards, relief has not reached them,” said Ulka Mahajan from Sarvahara Jan Andolan. “Also, the government has offered subsidies to segments of informal workers like construction workers, but many are unregistered and do not have bank accounts,” Mahajan added. “The government needs to set up food kitchens offering ready meals in slums.

Viren Shah from the Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association said, “We are hoping for some reopening of the retail sector in Mumbai, where cases have gone down, and also for a package for the retail sector.” Indian Merchants’ Chamber president Rajiv Poddar said, “We can understand the need to extend restrictions since the pandemic is still severe, but perhaps they can increase attendance in private offices to at least 30%.” The restaurant sector will face more closures if restrictions continue for much longer, said Shivanand Shetty, president of the Indian Hotel and Restaurants Association. “Home deliveries of food items are only helping to keep the kitchens open and to offset losses by 15-20%,” he said. “Given the high rents, in the absence of a relief package, many restaurants will have no option but to shut down,” he said. Hoteliers and retailers said around of the 35% establishments have not opened since the first lockdown. Now, in the second wave, those owning the premises or those who can afford rent are functioning with just 25% staff for the sake of home deliveries and takeaways, which contribute little to the overall income. “Paying taxes and surviving will be a tough task.

The court reserved the order for May 3. Also, the recording of statement of lone eyewitness, Gurniwaz Singh, son of Aikom and Seerat, that was slated for Wednesday has been deferred to May 12 after Seerat’s counsel cited her absence. Darshan Singh Dhillon, brother of Aikom, said they have been fighting for justice for the past four years. He said, “We opposed the bail application, as the statements of Gurniwaz and prime witness Tul Bahadur, an auto driver, were yet to be recorded. If Seerat is let out on bail, she will definitely influence the witnesses.” Tul Bahadur is yet to record his statement as police failed to produce him in court. He had last appeared in court in December 2017, but his statement was not recorded. He is suspected to have moved to his native place in Nepal. Police have also not been able to produce the BMW car in court in which suitcase stuffed with the body was loaded outside the house of Aikom. Tul Bahadur, in his statement to the police, had mentioned the car in which he saw Seerat loading the suitcase from which blood was oozing. BMW is now parked at Mataur police station. Seerat, lodged in Ropar jail, was recently accused of ferrying drugs to the prison. She was caught at the jail gate with drugs hidden in sanitary napkins. She was booked under the NDPS Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/body-in-suitcase-accused-wife-seerat-applies-for-bail/articleshow/82298508.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

Though the registration started from Wednesday, the jabs will begin in a phased manner from May 1. As per the census data, there are around 3-lakh residents between 18-44 years of age. Chandigarh will only get Covishield vaccines at the moment. The UT health department has been communicating with the Serum Institute of India (SII), which has said they would confirm about the supply within three days. Also, there is no clarity on the price of the Covid vaccine at present.The UT health department has 94,078 doses left for residents above 45 years of age, but no new consignment for those above 18 years. “As there is no confirmation of supplies, we have opened limited slots. The UT administration has approved to buy one lakh doses from SII for this age group category. The manufacturers will let us know when and how much can be supplied here. However, we will be opening 50 slots at 15 sites for the new category. This will benefit around 1,000 beneficiaries per day,” said UT director health services (DHS) Dr Amandeep Kang. She said, “We have minimum vaccine wastage and thus will be able to provide better coverage to the beneficiaries.”The Centre has given flexibility to the states and UTs to open slots from May 1, depending on the vaccine availability. “If we do not get fresh consignment for the new category, we will halt their vaccination for some time. We cannot let the second dose beneficiaries wait for their booster shots. We will inform about the selected sites on Thursday,” said the DHS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/20k-doses-diverted-to-18-yrs-and-above-pool/articleshow/82298504.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Hospital authorities said the tree branches fell following gusty winds. About 300 patients were admitted at the hospital, 40 of them on oxygen, at the time of the incident. The police control room and the district administration received emergency calls from the hospital. Within 10 minutes, Parbhani superintendent of police (SP) Jayant Meena drove his own car to the hospital while his team from the headquarters too rushed to the spot. Soon, district collector D M Muglikar and additional SP Mummaka Sudarshan also reached there with their teams. The authorities said the winds had also caused a power failure, making the rescue operation even more difficult. However, the police team picked up the jumbo cylinders and rushed them into the ward where the critically-ill patients were taking treatment. The oxygen supply from the tank was restored after three hours, with biomedical engineer Sunil Kulkarni assisting in the task.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/tree-branches-snap-o2-supply-at-hosp-cops-rush-in-gas-cylinder/articleshow/82296678.cms||---

K Anjan Kumar, 29, a medical representative from Alair in Buvanagiri Yadadri district, and K Bhaskar Rao, 39, a medical store owner from Nacharam, were arrested by Medipally police of Rachakonda commissionerate on Tuesday night while they were trying to sell Covifor Remdesivir injection vials for Rs 30,000 each. At 3 pm on Tuesday, police received specific information about black market sale of Remdesivir injection at Medilife Medical and General Stores at Annapurna colony, Boduppal.

As the month comes to an end, the number stands at a staggering all-time high of 32,427. Also, every second containment zone in Delhi is now in south Delhi. With over 22,000 new Covid-19 cases every day, the number of active cases in Delhi stands at more than one lakh now, double the previous high of 44,456 active cases on November 14, 2020. As a result, this month has seen more than 1,000 new containment zones being notified every day. On April 2, there were 2,701 containment zones in the capital, of which 2,007 were active zones. The total number of red zones on Thursday, April 29, stood at 35,924, with the number of active zones being 32,427. The last four weeks have seen an astounding increase of 1,230% in the number of active zones as the number of Covid cases has exploded in the city. Of the 32,427 active containment zones in the city, 44.2%, or 14,324, are located in just one of the total 11 revenue districts in the capital — South district. The South district not only has the highest number of active zones among the 11 revenue districts, but has also added the highest number of new containment zones in the given period. Compared with the South district, the Central (5,189) and New Delhi (3,167) districts are a distant second and third in the list. There now are 1,798 active containment zones in South-East district Earlier this month, Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain had said that micro containment zones were being created wherever 2-3 Covid cases were detected in close proximity in order to contain the spread of the coronavirus. While the middle- and upper-middle class localities were reporting more cases during the initial days of April, the highly congested, lower-middle class neighbourhoods have seen an exponential growth in Covid cases of late. While the South district has the highest number of red zones, the Central district has seen the active zones there go up by a staggering 9,690% since April 2 — from 53 to 5,189. The East district, which has the lowest number of red zones, has seen the number of localities being sealed increase 377% from 52 to 248. In south Delhi, while areas like Vasant Kunj, Vasant Vihar and RK Puram had a proportionately much higher number of containment zones at the beginning of the month, the areas that have seen a huge spurt in the number of infected individuals and, as a result, an increase in containment zones are residential areas like Malviya Nagar, which now has nearly 1,500 red zones, Chhatarpur with more than 800 red zones, Dakshinpuri and nearby Sangam Vihar with around 600 containment zones each. Apart from these neighbourhoods, Saket has around 500 red zones and Gautam Nagar, Safdarjung Enclave and Green Park each have 400 such zones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/32k-sealed-zones-over-44-in-south-district-alone/articleshow/82317459.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Surat||Surat: 45-day-old slays Covid-19, fights off severe lung infection||SURAT: On Wednesday, when a month-and-half-old Arul was brought home by his parents, he was welcomed in a celebratory atmosphere similar to when he had come home for the first time after his birth. For Arul’s parents Rajneesh Pandey and Udita Pandey, it was another birth for their son in such a short period of time. Just a few days ago, Arul had all tubes tied to his body and kept in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) because 10 days after his birth, he had tested positive for Covid-19. “My wife had tested positive first and then our son. We took him to an urban health clinic because he had fever and his pulse was high,” said Rajneesh, who works with Adani Hazira Port Pvt Ltd in Surat. At the centre the baby had tested positive for coronavirus. Rajneesh then took him to a private hospital on Ring Road from where he was discharged after four days. Rajneesh and Udita’s moment of relief was shortlived as Arul started vomiting and developed breathing problems. When his x-ray was taken on April 8, the doctors at the hospital were shocked to find that his right lung was filled with bullae. Doctors started treating the infant but the bullae would reappear. “There was a moment when the bullae had ruptured and created air leaks in the lungs,” said Dr Mohit Sahni, a neonatalist. “Such situation was seen in a very few adults who were infected with Covid, but never heard of it in infants,” he said. To drain out the bullae, doctors had to create a nick in Arul’s body and insert a tube. “Usually the tube is kept for four hours, but in this baby’s case we kept it for 24 hours and then took the x-ray,” Sahni said. After the bullae were drained out, Arul was kept on ventilators for three days. “It was a very difficult time for us. I used to get depressed by thinking about it, but when I used to see my son through video call, we used to get hope that he will make it,” said Rajneesh. “I moved to the city just a year ago so I knew nothing, but I received great support from colleagues as they were the only ones like a family here,” he added. Besides being kept on a ventilator, Arul was also administered heavy medicines like remdesivir and steroids. “Our concern was that the bullae should not reappear so even after we removed the ventilator, we kept the baby under observation for a few days,” Sahni said. “When we brought him home today, it was a moment which cannot be described. My wife and I are happy that our son is back home safe and sound,” Rajneesh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/45-day-old-slays-ncov-fights-off-severe-lung-infection/articleshow/82297592.cms||Jay Pachchigar
---||Chandigarh||Pan-city 24x7 water supply project gets nod||Chandigarh: The municipal corporation general house has approved the pan-city 24x7 water supply project and enhanced expenditure from Rs 438 crore to Rs 591 crore, which includes Rs 96 crore European Union grant. The amount was increased in the wake of the enhancement of the scope of the work, change in its socio-economic nature and capacity building programmes. Agence Française de Développement (AFD), a French agency, has already approved a loan of around Rs 410 crore for the project. Out of Rs 591 crore, besides the loan and the EU grant, the MC will have to spend Rs 80 crore in a phased manner. At present, the pilot project is being done by the Smart City authority, but this one will be undertaken by MC, which will take over the entire project for maintenance and other related works. Some major works included in the project are replacement of pumping machinery and around 2km pipes coming from Kajauli. The plant, situated in Sector 39, will also be upgraded so that after starting the project, there are no technical or supply issues.“The French team that came a few months back visited Kajauli, Sector 39 based-water works, and various areas of the city. Later during a discussion, they asked the authority to include rehabilitation colonies and economically-weaker section areas and also sensitise people about the project. A soft plan has also been made for the project,” an official said.No water tariff revision There will not be any revision in water tariff. The tariff will be revised when the project is started. The selected company will be given five years to implement the project after getting approval from the competent authority. The MC will pay interest of 1.47% per annum on the loan, which is minimal.  The French team A team of the AFD, comprising technical experts of the French government, had visited the city recently to discuss details of the 24x7 water supply project. Since they were to give grant and loan, the French team had explained the mode of payment, its criteria and how the money will be released. The team, which stayed in the city for five days, had assessed the water supply system and held multiple talks with all the stakeholders, including officials, technical experts, engineers, municipal councillors and residents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pan-city-24x7-water-supply-project-gets-nod/articleshow/82298451.cms||Deepak Yadav

Mukesh Shukla, SHO of Majhola police station, said an FIR has been registered against the accused under various IPC sections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/4-staffers-of-3-top-pvt-hospitals-held-for-trade-in-remdesivir-fabiflu/articleshow/82297590.cms||Maria Khan

Therefore, from May 1, salaries of the employees will be linked with GPS watches. Location of the employees would also be available on MC’s official website in coming few days, said municipal commissioner KK Yadav.Initially, some councillors were of the view that there was no need for the watches, as these had technical issues, but Yadav strongly advocated the use to improve the system. He told members of the house that there were financial implications too. Yadav also announced to form a committee, including some councillors, to look into technical issues.“It was the unanimous decision of the house to approve GPS watches that cost around Rs 18 lakh ,” Yadav said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-staff-will-have-to-wear-gps-watches/articleshow/82298410.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra to get 800 Tocilizumab doses||NAGPUR: Maharashtra has got the highest (800) life-saving Tocilizumab injections, known to have fairly sound response in the severely affected Covid patients. As per the district administration, and Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) sources, the latest allotment of the central government will be released in the coming days. Given the current rate of positivity and active cases, especially number of hospitalizations and death rate, the ratio of Tocilizumab allotted to Nagpur was expected to be higher than the existing lot, said an official from the Core Covid Task Force. Some of the states like Gujarat, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, MP and central institutions have got 200 injections each. States like Uttarakhand and Jharkhand have got only 25. The ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) and the department of pharmaceuticals have issued an allotment letter advising the states to ensure the limited stocks are used ‘judiciously’ and strictly as per the ‘standard treatment protocol issued by the joint monitoring group of the MoHFW’. The stock, which is in the process of being despatched to Cipla company depots in various regions, will go to Covid hospitals via state governments. The imported drug has been in short supply in the market after the Covid surge hit, taking the health infrastructure and administration by surprise. The foreign manufactured injection, manufactured by Roche, is priced around Rs41,000. Despite the high price, the injection is much in demand as medical fraternity feels it is highly useful in suppressing the cytokine storm (aggravated response of the immune system) in patients with high degree of Covid severity. Nagpur, one of the worst hit cities of Maharashtra in the second Covid wave, is learnt to have received 16 injections around a week ago. This was far too short than the demand in the entire region. The injections also go to other parts of Maharashtra from Nagpur depot of the carrying and forwarding agent. The dealers in Marathwada, Vidarbha, Madhya Pradesh and some in Chhattisgarh are dependent upon stocks at the Nagpur depot. Nagpur district collector Ravindra Thakare, who is already rationing the other in demand drug Remdesivir and oxygen, said stock of Tocilizumab expected is so less that there would be no meaning in trying to ration it. “There are almost 50-60 prescriptions being generated for Tocilizumab from each Covid hospital per day. In comparison, the stock expected would be very less,” he said. Thakare, reflecting on the trend in the medical fraternity, said replacements like Bevacizumab are gaining popularity now in place of Tocilizumab. The district collector also said the city has not received any consignment of Remdesivir till late evening, and no allotment could be made to hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/maha-to-get-800-tocilizumab-doses/articleshow/82299691.cms||Soumitra Bose

SMC staff came out on road asking shop owners and traders to close their units. However, offices were allowed to operate with 50% strength. Diamond and textile units also remained operational. “The government should have communicated earlier. Today majority of the local traders were not aware of the closure order,” said Narendra Saboo, president of Surat Mercantile Association (SMA). At the diamond markets in Mahidharpura and Mini Bazaar, the crowd was as usual in the morning, but later police cleared it. Team of SMC officials visited different areas in the city and asked shop owners to close down.“As per the government notification restaurants, shops, malls and other commercial establishments are required to remain closed. We will ensure strict enforcement of the order since it is important for controlling the spread of Covid-19,” said Ajay Tomar, city police commissioner.

Police said that with the help of a woman customer they were able to catch one Mayur Chandubhai Dudhat, who had promised to sell the injections at Rs 25,000 for the first one, and Rs 35,000 for the next.

---||Dehradun||Women entrepreneurs providing doorstep delivery of home-cooked meals to Covid affected families in Doon||DEHRADUN: Amid rising Covid-19 infections in Dehradun, several women entrepreneurs associated with Tejasvani Business Association (TBA) have taken it upon themselves to provide home-cooked meals to the infected people and their families. An affected family only needs to produce a Covid-19 positive report to avail their free service. The food tiffins usually contain pulses and cooked green vegetables to ensure that the family in need gets the right nutrition. The women running the service are the owners of small businesses like boutiques, salons, and others. Some of these women also run self-help groups. Priya Gulati, the founder of TBA (a company providing business administration service), told TOI, “We are getting dozens of orders every day. In some cases, we are providing food to big joint families. The women associated with this initiative are overlooking their businesses to reach out to others in need. We believe that this is the time to serve humanity and not be driven by commercial interests.” She further said, “Our service depends upon the availability of volunteers in a particular area. We are trying to cover as much ground as possible. The big localities with more households are being looked after by women who are better placed financially..” While some of these women deliver the food themselves, many others have hired people (usually vendors) who are delivering the food for free. “In our family, three people have tested Covid-19-positive. Thus, we cannot turn to a maid or some relative for help. In such times, the Tejasvani group is doing us a big favour by delivering home-cooked meals,” said Ravi Kumar, a resident of Race Course in Dehradun. TBA volunteers say that the food is provided at least two times a day but when requested, they also try to deliver morning breakfast and evening snacks. Not just food, some women are also delivering medicines to the people in need. Several city-based eateries have also come forward in this regard. “We have delivered food to over 500 households so far. We have been catering to families in Rajpur Road, Canal Road & Sahastradhara,” said Manjeet Singh, restaurant in-charge, Four Points by Sheraton which started a similar drive a week ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/women-entrepreneurs-providing-doorstep-delivery-of-home-cooked-meals-to-covid-affected-families-in-doon/articleshow/82297602.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Delhi||Covid admissions at ITBP facility in Chhatarpur go up||New Delhi: A day after ITBP, which is managing Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre at Radha Soami Satsang Beas in south Delhi’s Chhatarpur, reported oxygen shortage as a reason behind less oxygen beds in operation—the centre saw slight improvement in oxygen supply leading to more admissions on Thursday. An ITBP official said they were gradually expanding the operational beds to 500. While only 211 beds were occupied on Wednesday, the number rose to 361 on Thursday. The statement issued by ITBP stated that, till 6pm on Thursday, 273 men and 122 women were admitted to the facility. An official said 97 fresh admissions were made during the day against 52 on Wednesday. Five patients were discharged and seven were referred to other hospitals on Thursday, ITBP said. At a time when the capital is reeling under Covid-19 crisis and almost all available oxygen and ICU beds in hospitals are occupied, SPCCC Radha Soami Satsang Beas centre was expected to provide a relief. However, lack of oxygen supply has affected expansion of operational bed. The centre was restarted on Monday with 150 oxygen beds, which is expected to be scaled to 500 by the end of this week. The centre, which was first started in July last year, was not in use since earlier this year after Delhi saw a major dip in cases. The reopening on Monday was marred by chaotic scenes, as a large number of patients and their relatives landed up looking for beds. The government plans to further increase the number of beds at the facility to 2,000, and eventually to 5,000. The government is also creating a 200-bed ICU facility at the centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-admissions-at-itbp-facility-in-chhatarpur-go-up/articleshow/82317467.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chandigarh||Drop in devotees at Golden Temple amid daily curbs, weekend lockdown||Amritsar: Daily curbs and weekend lockdown, owing to surge in Covid-19 cases, has led to a significant drop in devotees at the Golden Temple even though there has been a demand that government lift the weekend lockdown in view of the religious sentiments on the occasion of 400 centenary celebration of Sikh’s ninth master Guru Teg Bahadur. The TOI visited Golden Temple on Wednesday and interacted with a few devotees as well all the management. Kabal Singh , a devotee from Hoshiarpur said he along with his wife and two children left for Amritsar in his car around 4.30am. “In normal circumstances, I leave Hoshiarpur around 8am and reach home by 10.30pm. But now, it is 2.30pm and we are rushing back as evening lockdown will be imposed by 6pm,” he said. His wife Kuldeep Kaur said, “Pandemic has changed our lives. We are not even free to fulfill our religious aspirations.” Charanjit Singh from Fatehgarh Churian, near Amritsar, said he was surprised to see the low turnout. “I don’t see even 50% of the sangat as compared to my last visit in March. Due to Covid, people are not willing to visit crowded places,” he said and added that the Punjab government should give special permission for the Guru’s anniversary celebrations on May 1. Jagjeevan Singh, who owns a retail shop in the vicinity of Golden Temple, claimed that he had seen so few visitors for such a long time for the first time in his life. “We open our shops at 9am, but don’t know whether there will be any customers.” He said that last year there were few devotees coming from other cities but even the local devotees or those arriving from nearby cities had declined significantly now. SGPC spokesperson Kulwinder Singh Ramdas held the coronavirus pandemic responsible for low turnout of devotees. “There is around a 50% drop in the number of devotees since people are scared of the pandemic,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/drop-in-devotees-at-golden-temple-amid-daily-curbs-weekend-lockdown/articleshow/82299694.cms||Yudhvir Rana

---||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana HC extends interim orders passed by it & subordinate courts till June 30||CHANDIGARH: In view of the alarming increase in the Covid-19 cases and the grave situation that has arisen in the region, the Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday suo motu extended the interim orders passed by it and the subordinate courts till June 30. With this, all kinds of bails or interim relief granted to an accused by the HC or the subordinate courts for a limited period and which were likely to expire, have been extended till June 30, 2021. This relief would continue till the accused are found abusing such liberty. In case of abuse, it may be cancelled at the instance of the state or the complainant, on application with adequate proof of the abuse of liberty by the accused. Similarly, parole granted to a person by the order passed by a court that is near expiry will now be extended till June 30. The HC order has also clarified that unless there is a necessity of arrest for maintenance of law and order or any other emergent case, in a cognizable offence prescribing sentence up to 7-year imprisonment, the police will desist from arresting the accused up to June 30. The HC order, however, has clarified that such directions may not be understood as an interdict on the power of the police to arrest, but should only be considered a mere advisory in the face of the ongoing crisis following the second wave of novel coronavirus. The HC order has also made it clear that till June 30, the state governments of Punjab and Haryana and UT Chandigarh, or any of its departments or any municipal corporation/council/board or any gram panchayat or any other local body or any other agency and instrumentality of the state shall not take any action for eviction and demolition in respect of any property, over which any citizen or person or party or any Body corporate, has physical or symbolic possession as on date. The bank or financial institutions have also been directed not to take action for auction in respect of any property of any citizen or person or party or any Body corporate till June 30. The time of compliance of any directions given by the HC or subordinate courts to the states, UT Chandigarh, or the central government by the HC to do a particular thing or carry out a certain direction in a particular manner in a time frame has also been extended till June 30. The time for filing of a written statement or return in any suit or proceeding pending before any civil court or any other forum, unless specifically directed, will be extended till June 30. However, this will not preclude the parties from filing such a written statement or return before June 30. Any order passed by the high court, subordinate courts, or tribunal or any quasi-judicial form regarding eviction, dispossession, demolition, etc, shall also remain in abeyance till June 30. A division bench comprising Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha and Justice Suvir Sehgal passed these orders after taking the opinion of the advocate-generals of the states, additional solicitor-general of India and the senior standing counsel of UT Chandigarh. The bench has also appointed senior advocate Anupam Gupta as amicus curiae to assist the court on the issue. “It is observed that the litigants are not able to get in touch with counsels who in turn are finding it difficult to prepare files and get the matters listed at an early date. The situation that has arisen demands that certain measures be taken up so as to ensure that during this crisis, generation of litigation can be controlled for some time,” observed the bench in its detailed order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-extends-interim-orders-passed-by-it-subordinate-courts-till-june-30/articleshow/82299700.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Kolkata||‘His plots always had a touch of science’||Kolkata: The world of Bengali literature lost another popular author, Anish Deb, to Covid on Wednesday. He was also a noted professor of applied physics at the Calcutta University and doubled up as an author of mystery stories, science fiction and ghost stories. After retiring from CU, he was teaching at the Adamas University. Deb wrote both for young adults and adults and in time filled up the void that was left by writers like Adrish Bardhan. He built up his stories in a way that created an eerie atmosphere full of suspense and inexplicable fear. “He was a student and teacher of science and hence never left the path of logic while building up his plots. That is where he was different from other horror and mystery writers,” said Tridib Chattopadhyay, head of Patra Bharati, who published most of Deb’s books. “He was more an observer than a speaker, soaking in everything around him. We could see a reflection of that in his stories. In the present times, he was one of the leading mystery and science fiction authors in Bengali,” said Subhankar Dey, director of Dey’s Publishing who also published some of Deb’s adult writings. A student of Hindu School, Deb did his graduation in physics and then his B Tech, M Tech and PhD in applied physics. He won the university’s gold medal twice and a silver medal. Some of his popular books include, Goenda ACG collection, Teish Ghanta Shat Minute, Agun Ranger Bullet, Bhootnath-er Diary, Shera Science Fiction collection, Pi niye Rupkatha, Bigyaner Harekrakam, Sahaj Kathae Internet and so on. Among the awards he won were Prachin Kalakendra Sahitya Puraskar (1998), Gyanchandra Ghosh national award, Delhi University Narasimha Das Award, Dinesh Chandra Smriti Puraskar and Vidyasagar Puraskar from the state government for his lifetime achievement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/his-plots-always-had-a-touch-of-science/articleshow/82298691.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Ahmedabad||‘Consider raising govt quota to 50%’||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday asked the state government to seriously consider increasing its quota of beds at private Covid designated hospitals from the current 20% to 50%, on which patients can get free treatment. The issue was raised by advocate Anand Yagnik on Tuesday during the hearing of the PIL on Covid-19 and he demanded that the government’s quota be increased from the present 20% to 50% as fixed last year. When the judges inquired with the government, the court was told that last year there was resistance from private hospitals in this regard. In its order, the court observed that the suggestion appears to be justified when the number of cases have shot up many times over from the first phase. “We required the state to consider this aspect seriously when in the previous round of the first phase 50% beds had been allocated as government quota, then why only 20% this time,” the court sought a reply on this aspect during the next hearing. On the shortage of human resources, the state government complained that it is not getting trained manpower and is trying to engage students of medical and paramedical courses. It has authorized collectors and municipal commissioners to fill posts and orders have been issued to 1,242 bonded doctors to immediately join duty.The HC asked the government to complete this exercise of engaging people from the medical field “on a war footing at breakneck speed”. It further said, “Any one found violating and not complying with the directions of the state should be adequately dealt with in accordance with law.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/consider-raising-govt-quota-to-50/articleshow/82298696.cms||---

The incident was reported from Kishni village under the jurisdiction of Bisalpur police station. The victim, Nanhe Lal, alias Suneel, 35, was a marginal farmer. The injured were admitted to a hospital, said police adding that their condition is stable. The victim’s family alleged that their house was set on fire by a candidate for the post of village head over political rivalry. The family alleged that a village head contestant had threatened them of dire consequences after they refused to vote for him during the recently concluded panchayat elections on April 26. When they were sleeping in the night, the accused set their house on fire, they alleged. A probe is on. The victim’s younger brother Naresh said, “When we woke up, there was no time to put out the fire that reduced everything to the ashes. My brother also died. I’m sure Bankelal and his men were behind the fire as we had not voted for him.” Bidalpur circle officer Prashant Singh, who inspected the spot along with revenue department officials, told TOI, “The family has been given interim compensation. The body was sent for autopsy and the injured were given proper treatment. We are yet to assess the loss. It seems to be a case of an accidental fire. We have not received a written complaint, so far. We are investigating the matter.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/election-rivalry-one-dead-3-injured-after-house-set-on-fire/articleshow/82297609.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Nagpur||Animal cruelty videos by teens irk activists||NAGPUR: Cases of youngsters indulging in cruel animal abuse amid the current extended restrictions due to Covid have surfaced on social media, infuriating animal welfare activists. They have now approached police and cyber cell authorities who are now tracking the culprits. The complaint was made by city animal welfare group Save Speechless Organization (SSO). “Few days ago we received a complaint on social media through a post which showed two teenagers hanging a dog by his neck with a rope. They were seen enjoying the brutal act and kept on strangulating the animal till it died. When we contacted them on their social media account, the video was immediately deleted. We have retained a screenshot,” said founder of SSO Smita Mire. In another such horrendous case, a video came out on social media on Tuesday in which a young boy was seen squeezing and hurting a dog’s ears. In the video seen by TOI, it is apparent that the boy was enjoying the heinous act while the animal kept screaming in pain. The boy’s social media account has more such videos in which he is seen hurting animals through different objects. The boy keeps on laughing while doing so. While the NGO members are yet to trace the location of first video, they managed to get details of the second. “In one of the videos, a motorcycle can be seen along with the number plate. When we traced the vehicle number, we found that the video was shot in Washim,” said Mire. Disturbed by the incidents, the NGO met deputy commissioner of police DCP Vinita Sahu and senior inspector Ashok Bagul of cyber police station. “Both have assured to take stern action. The police will be filing a first information report in the next two days and then the matter will be forwarded to the cyber cell,” said Mire. As per the rules, FIR should be registered under sections 428 and 29 of the Indian Penal Code, section 11 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 and section 66D of IT act as few accounts are reportedly fake. According to activists, committing such acts is not just illegal but also signs of abnormal behaviour. “Children and youngsters are not going to schools and colleges due to lockdown. Parents now need to be alert and keep an eye on their activities, especially on social media. If youngsters think they can get popularity by posting such videos on social media, they need to be told that animal cruelty is a punishable offence,” said Mire.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/animal-cruelty-videos-by-teens-irk-activists/articleshow/82299695.cms||Manka Behl
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Struggle for beds continues, helplines hang up to SOS calls||LUCKNOW: Despite addition of more hospitals for Covid-19 treatment, patients continued to struggle for critical care bed in a Covid facility on Wednesday. From lack of information in public domain about availability of beds to not getting response to SOS calls on helplines, finding a hospital bed remains a Herculean task. The online dashboard (https://beds.dgmhup-covid19.in/EN/covid19bedtrack) providing bed occupancy status in Covid hospitals started functioning on Wednesday, but since adequate publicity of the portal has not been made by the administration, many were not aware about it. Even those who were aware about it found that the portal, as on Wednesday night, had names and details of only two dozen hospitals out of 72 in the city. Those who managed to get the contact numbers of private hospitals were greeted by engaged tones. In some cases, calls were taken but people were informed that all beds that are to be filled without the chief medical officer’s (CMO) referral are occupied. People also complained about inadequate response from the Integrated Covid Command Control Centre (ICCC) when they called for beds reserved under CMO-referral category. Most were told that critical care beds are not available, while isolation beds are in abundance. Some were fortunate to get beds through ICCC but issuance of CMO referral took 3-6 hours. In such a desperate situation, a few sent SOS to district administration officers directly but with little relief. As per the recent government order, private Covid hospitals can take admissions directly in 90% beds and with CMO referral in 10%, while the ratio for government supported facilities is direct admission on 30% beds and CMO referral for remaining 70%. “We know only some big Covid hospitals and are not aware about others,” said Anoop Kumar who frantically called helplines to get a hospital bed for his mother, a Covid-29 patient whose blood oxygen level dropped to 70% on Tuesday night. Homemaker Roma Suri, who desperately wanted to hospitalise her ailing husband, complained that numbers of some private hospitals remained constantly busy. “A few hospitals which took the calls informed me that no oxygen supported bed is available. Then I called ICCC for a CMO referral bed but got the response that all beds with oxygen support are full,” she added. Rajneesh Kushwaha had to wait for six hours to get a CMO referral to get his wife admitted to a government aided medical college. “All my family members tried desperately from 10am and we could get a bed in the evening,” he said. He later got phone numbers of some private Covid hospitals from his friends. “I called at least 15 hospitals, but in most places the phone was busy. I then drove from one hospital to another with my mother in the car for four hours when finally, I could get a bed in a facility on IIM Road in the morning,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/struggle-for-beds-continues-helplines-hang-up-to-sos-calls/articleshow/82299725.cms||Mohita Tewari
---||Delhi||Cut for infra, dead trees will now be used to meet funeral demand in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Trees being cut to make way for large-scale infrastructure projects are now going to meet the rising demand of wood for Covid cremations in the national capital. Public health officials say crematoriums have wood left for another week or so, and buffer stocks will have to be created to meet the ever-rising demand for funeral pyres. Two truckloads of trees chopped for the Delhi-Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System project have already been received and the municipal corporations are now looking for more, said an official. North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash said they had asked for wood from trees being felled by National Highway Authority of India for various highway and road expansion projects. “We will also approach Delhi Metro Rail Corporation and other agencies executing various projects that require tree felling. If these trees are already required to be removed, they should be used to meet the demand at the city crematoria so that pressure on the supply chain can be eased,” he added. Each cremation requires four-five quintals of wood and more than 700 Covid-protocol funerals over and above the non-Covid cremations are taking place in the city every day. Some officials say the current stock in the city crematoria can last only for another eight-nine days. Jai Prakash said that while he had also contacted Uttar Pradesh to fill the gap, the internal demand in UP itself had gone up significantly due to a large number of deaths. A letter has also been sent to the forest department and the Delhi chief minister. “As you are aware that the number of deaths due to Covid-19 is on the rise and to cremate the bodies in the traditional manner, a large amount of wood is required. This is to request you to direct the forest department to ensure steady supply of firewood to these crematoriums without fail,” it states. The letter urges Delhi government to issue appropriate directions “so that the crematoriums can continue doing their work uninterrupted and the bereaved families are not put into any kind of trouble”. Last week, TOI reported that the forest department had permitted South Delhi Municipal Corporation to chop nearly 200 standing dead or dry trees for utilising the wood for cremations. Civic officials are now pushing for more actions in this regard. Around 2,900 trees are expected to be axed for five sewage treatment plants. DMRC has identified 11,454 trees for felling for the expansion work on the Janakpuri-RK Ashram, Maujpur-Majlis Park and Aerocity-Tughlaqabad corridors under Phase IV. “A large number of trees will be chopped for infrastructure projects. An early decision needs to be taken by the forest department in this regard,” a civic official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cut-for-infra-dead-trees-will-now-be-used-to-meet-funeral-demand/articleshow/82317483.cms||Paras Singh
---||Ahmedabad||Nehru Bridge reopens after 45 days||Ahmedabad: Nehru Bridge, which was closed to traffic on March 4 for repairs reopened on Wednesday, after 45 days. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) officials said that as promised the work was completed in time as the bridge is an important one for the city, connecting Ashram Road to Lal Darwaza, Relief Road and the walled city. The bridge, which was built in 1960, needed urgent repairs. The repairs on the 442m long and 22.6m wide bridge cost Rs 3.25 crore. Traffic had been diverted to Gandhi Bridge and Ellis Bridge and this led to heavy congestion on these bridges, which already bore heavy traffic use. In 2019, that AMC had closed Subhash Bridge for 20 days. In the coming months, the AMC will repair the Chimanbhai Patel flyover, which was built in 1994, the Dakshini railway flyover built in 2009, and the Prabodh Raval flyover built in 2001. On March 14 the AMC began the second phase of repairs to the bridge. The first phase involved grouting (filling and repairing cracks in the concrete) on the piers and carriageway, followed by maintenance of the bearings. Officials said that the 12 piers of the bridge have 12 bearings each, which needed to be cleaned and greased. The bearings that were badly damaged were replaced. Another 162 bearings which are part of the seven-suspended spans also underwent repair and maintenance. Of the seven spans of the bridge, five are 18.9m long while two are 11.3m long.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/nehru-bridge-reopens-after-45-days/articleshow/82299730.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Oxygen shortage in districts rising||JAIPUR: Several districts are facing oxygen shortage and are unable to meet the growing demand in hospitals. Currently, the district oxygen committees are not allowed to allocate cylinders more than the number of oxygen beds leading to scarcity. Baran district is getting 248 refuelled cylinders daily from Chittorgarh, while the number of patients have surpassed 300. In Hanumangarh district, the quota of 100 cylinders per day for the last seven days ended on Wednesday. Baran CHMO Dr Sampath Raj Nagar told TOI they had a quota of 248 daily cylinders seven days ago. “Every district has to provide an estimate of oxygen cylinder requirement in advance for seven days. Our reserve estimates considering the mean increase in the number of cases and recoveries is 280-300. Anything below the figure would create a problem for us,” said Nagar. The mismatch in demand and supply, if not corrected, in the coming days can be problematic for patients with severe condition. The state rule says that every district has to form an oxygen supply committee that will access the requirement and inform the state government. A medical staff requesting anonymity said they have to discharge patients soon after they show the first signs of recovery, maintaining normal oxygen level for some hours, to allow a critical patient to occupy the space. Raising an alarm on the ending quota, CMHO Hanumangarh Dr Navneet Sharma said they had been getting 100 cylinders every day from Ganganagar for the past six days and their quota of 700 cylinders will end on Thursday. “In our letter raising the demand for the next seven days, we have written it to increase it by 50 since the rise in positive cases is steady,” said Sharma. A doctor said they were struggling to meet the oxygen requirement since April 15. “The assessment we give to the CMHO office has often been reduced. Until oxygen is available in excess in every hospital, rightful treatment is not feasible,” said a doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/o2-shortage-in-districts-rising/articleshow/82298753.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Kindling hope: Family support helped them defeat Covid-19 in Lucknow||LUCKNOW: Family support and positive thinking made several critically ill Covid-18 patients defeat the virus and come home after spending days in hospitals. Advocate Vijay Kumar Gupta (40), a resident of Vrindavan colony, felt acute chest pain and breathlessness on April 14. The blood oxygen level also started dipping. He tried several hospitals, but no beds were available. Finally, a day after, he got a bed in Balrampur hospital. “Condition improved after hospitalisation, but four days after, I noticed blood traces in sputum after continuous coughing. A sudden thought came to my mind that I might not survive, but my wife continued to motivate me. She was in the covid ward sitting next to my bed all through my days in hospital and later even got infected, but did not budge. She gave me medicines regularly, helped me with an oxygen support system and kept saying that I need to fight and survive for our five-year-old son,” he said. “Doctors too were available round the clock. I recovered after about seven days," he added. Wife remained asymptomatic and recovered soon, he said. Rekha Sethi (61), a homemaker and resident of Aishbagh, said she was scared while going to hospital on April 8 after being diagnosed with Covid-19. “I was afraid to be alone in the hospital away from loved ones and fight the battle alone. However, my husband and son kept calling me after every two hours, providing mental and emotional support,” she said. Rekha recovered after 13 days of hospitalisation. Her son Shubh was informed that his mother was first admitted to a government hospital, but as her condition deteriorated and there was no ICU facility there, she was shifted to a big private hospital. “However, in the private hospital ICU charges were Rs 50,000 per day, which we couldn’t afford. Hence, after three days, we got her shifted to another private hospital which provided the same facility at lower rates. In between, her blood oxygen level fluctuated between 70-80%. At times, she told us that she has lost all hope, but we kept on motivating her. In the meantime, my father also tested positive, but had mild symptoms and recovered in home isolation,” he recalled. “It was a tough time for our family, but we triumphed through will power," said Subh, who during this period had to handle everything at home from cooking to sanitisation and medical care of father and rush to hospital to arrange for medicines and drugs prescribed by doctors for her treatment. Krishnanagar resident Ashok Vardhan (70), a retired engineer from Uttar Pradesh State Bridge Corporation, came back home after spending 18 days in hospital. He was hospitalised on April 6 following acute chest infection and low blood oxygen levels. “My family remained in touch with me constantly through video calls. Some patients in the ward became friends. We ate meals together and motivated each other as doctors and nursing staff told us that nothing works as better as the hope,” he said. “I went as a stranger to the hospital, but people in hospital became my second family,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kindling-hope-family-support-helped-them-defeat-covid/articleshow/82299750.cms||---

His family in the US, Patel was living alone in Gandhinagar Society in Khokhra. When his neighbours found out about his death, they were reluctant to help perform the last rites. But a group of Good Samaritans, who got to know of the situation, landed up at his house and prepared his body for cremation.  Harshad Patel, a social worker from Amraiwadi, said that they got to know about Patel’s demise and realized that the neighbours were reluctant to help in performing the last rites. “Locals called up councillor Chetan Parmar and a few youths who came in PPE kits, gloves, and protective gear to help the family. The group brought his body down, bathed him, and performed necessasry rituals before taking his body to Isanpur crematorium,” said Patel, adding that his son was contacted in the US for his consent. Shirish Patel’s brother reached the crematorium to light the pyre and the last rites were performed according to the Covid protocol. “It was the second such funeral for us. We had performed the last rites of Maya Parmar, 33, who could not be taken to the crematorium by her family as all were infected,” said Parmar. Patel said that this wave is crueller for the family as often entire families are infected, and they get no external help to perform the last rites. “Of course, extending help is not completely safe – but at least it gives the already aggrieved family some solace that the last rites will be performed properly,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/good-samaritans-join-hands-to-lay-covid-victim-to-rest/articleshow/82299771.cms||---
---||Amritsar||Punjab inflated cotton cultivation claim on 5L hectares last year||BATHINDA: Punjab has drastically decreased the cultivation target for the area under cotton for the 2021-22 crop year to 3.25 lakh hectares. In the 2020-21 season, the Punjab government had claimed that the area under cotton cultivation had increased to 5 lakh hectares. The drastic cut in the cotton cultivation area was effected despite the fact that farmers got good remuneration in 2020-21 after many years of misery. The prices hovered above the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 5,725 per quintal for 27.5-28.5 mm staple. The prices had also breached the psychological mark of Rs 6,000 per quintal in February 2021. The Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) purchased over 50 percent of the total crop that landed in mandis in Punjab. It is after many years the CCI made such a big purchase and stopped after the prices had gone beyond the MSP. When questioned about the rationale behind decreasing the cultivation target area for cotton, the Punjab agriculture department claimed that during actual ‘girdawari’ (revenue assessment), the area under cotton in 2020-21 was found to be 2.51 lakh hectares not 5 lakh hectares. So, Punjab government’s claims last year were inflated by almost two times. Punjab agriculture department director Sukhdev Singh did not respond to repeated calls and text messages sent to him. However, additional chief secretary (development) Anirudh Tiwari in a text message confirmed that “actual area after girdawari was 2.51 lakh hectares under cotton during 2020-21.” On May 26, 2020, the then ACS (development) Viswajeet Khanna in a press statement had claimed Punjab had almost accomplished its target to bring 12.5 lakh acres (5 lakh hectares) under cotton with the sowing on 10 lakh acres (4 lakh hectares) and target would be completed very soon, in the first week of June. Again, on August 3, 2020, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh lauded the state farmers for the successful diversification of crops over 2.28 lakh hectares by withdrawing from the conventional wheat-paddy cultivation cycle in the Kharif sowing season. It was also claimed that the decision would save nearly 2.7 billion cubic metres of groundwater and Rs 200 crore in power consumption. ACS (development) Tiwari had said at that time that cotton cultivation has been carried out across 5.01 lakh hectares, which was 1.09 lakh hectares more compared to the previous year acreage of 3.92 lakh hectares. The sowing of cotton this year is getting delayed due to delayed procurement of wheat. Bathinda chief agriculture officer (CAO) Bahadur Singh said, “The state government has put the target at 3.25 lakh hectares in Punjab and it is 1.05 lakh hectares for Bathinda and cotton has so far been sown on 1,400 hectares.” Farmers are perplexed over the Punjab government’s decision to decrease the target for cotton sowing. “We were satisfied with the cotton crop last year as the prices remained good all around the year and were hoping the area under cotton would increase as after the central government coming up with the farm laws there is uncertainty over procurement of paddy. Under such circumstances, the state government should have made efforts to increase the area under cotton but astonishingly it has been decreased,” said farmers from Sangat and Jai Singh Wala villages in Bathinda district. Cotton trading body Indian Cotton Association Limited (ICAL) president Mahesh Sharda told TOI: “It is learnt that the Punjab government was inflating figures to show more cotton sowing in the state. This year, the farmers got good prices for the crop and the decreasing target of sowing is unimaginable. The state government should have gone for cotton sowing over more area.” Aam Aadmi Party MLA and party’s kisan wing head Kultar Singh Sandhwan said: “The government must look into this serious issue. It should investigate how the area set up for all crops was made, how many cotton seed packets were used and how much pesticide was used. All these point towards a scam”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/punjab-made-inflated-claim-about-cotton-cultivation-on-5-lakh-hectares-last-year/articleshow/82299736.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Ahmedabad||Consider easing death registration deadline: HC||Ahmedabad: At a time when people have queued up before the offices of the registrar of births and deaths, the Gujarat high court asked the state government to consider granting a relaxation in the deadline for registration of deaths during the lockdown, till the situation returns to normal. Many people could not get births and deaths of their kin registered for a year due to the lockdown and Covid-19 situation and they are now facing difficulties in going through the longer procedure. During a hearing on Tuesday on a suo motu PIL on the recent surge in Covid-19 cases, the bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Bhargav Karia suggested that the state government should extend the deadline for death registration to help people. The government was told that the department concerned can come out with a notification in this regard. The chief justice said he was asking the government to consider this after having received the suggestion from one of his brother judges. He said that the rule stipulates that a person has 30 days to apply for registration of birth or death in the family. If they miss the deadline, there is a long procedure to be followed to get a death registered. The chief justice said, “The number of deaths has also increased this year and there were movement restrictions. The common man is facing problems. They have to run around to district courts, to notaries for affidavits, tehsildars, patwaris and then the registration is carried out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/consider-easing-death-registration-deadline-hc/articleshow/82298785.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan High Court notice over discrimination in oxygen supply||JAIPUR: The high court on Wednesday issued notice to the Centre and state on a petition alleging discrimination by the Centre in allotting medical oxygen and lifesaving drugs to the state. Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice Indrajit Singh issued notice on a petition by lawyer P C Bhandari and sought replies by April 30. On another petition by the high court bar association, the court asked the central and state governments to give suggestions by Friday to reduce the hardship of Covid patients due to lack of oxygen in the hospitals of the state. The court directed the state government to update the status of beds in hospitals on its portal daily. The court asked the government to convert the Advocate Bhawan of Bar Council of Rajasthan in Jaipur and Jodhpur into Covid care centres. The court also directed that priority should be given to lawyers and their families at these Covid centres. The court has also asked for a committee to be formed to look after the cases of Covid among lawyers. The court said the issue of shortage of oxygen is pending in the Supreme Court and at present it did not intend to interfere in this matter. During the hearing, Advocate General M S Singhvi said the reported death of four people in a private hospital in the city was not due to lack of oxygen and there was sufficient oxygen in the hospital. The court then directed Singhvi to file an affidavit to this effect.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-notice-over-discrimination-in-supply-of-oxygen/articleshow/82298778.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Doctor removes pacemaker from Covid victim’s body||KOLKATA: A doctor at Baruipur hospital donned PPE gear to operate on a Covid dead body on Tuesday. It was not a post mortem that Dr Indranil Mitra had to perform. His intervention was required to remove a pacemaker from the body of Basudev Das, 72, before it could be consigned to the flames. The pacemaker needs to be extracted from a body before it is placed in an incinerator for cremation. “Pacemakers use a special sealant on their casing which, when exposed to extreme heat and pressure during the cremation process, can explode and cause damage to the crematory chamber. That is why it needed to be removed,” an electrical engineer in charge of maintenance of incinerators at crematoriums in Kolkata explained. The Narendrapur resident, who died of Covid on Monday, had undergone a heart surgery in Bengaluru in 2018, after which the pacemaker had been installed. After Das’s death, his son-in-law Sushanta Das contacted the local police which then sent a KMC hearse. When the driver learned from the family that a pacemaker was installed, he said the family needed to contact the police and get it removed. The police then contacted Dr Mitra, the assistant chief medical officer health of Baruipur sub-division. The body was transported to the Covid hospital in Baruipur where Dr Mitra and an assistant removed the pacemaker. The body was then sent to the Covid crematorium in Canning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/doc-removes-pacemaker-from-cov-victims-body/articleshow/82298786.cms||---
---||Meerut||Unions give names of ‘577 teachers who died during panchayat poll duty’ to SEC||Bareilly/Bijnor: Various teachers’ unions in UP came together on Wednesday to give a list of “577 teachers and support staff who died while doing panchayat poll duty in the state” to the Uttar Pradesh State Election Commission (UPSEC). The unions have now asked teachers to stay away on counting day, May 2. TOI has a copy of the letter prepared by Dinesh Chandra Sharma, president of UP Shikshak Mahasangh (UPSM), that has names and addresses of the 577 teachers and shiksha mitras. On Tuesday, the Allahabad HC had sent a notice to the SEC seeking explanation on Covid preparedness and the alleged deaths. A senior teacher’s union leader said, “To be honest, the court’s issuance of the notice has not benefited teachers because the next date of hearing in this case is May 3, which is a day after counting day. What was needed was postponement of counting at least, if not the fourth phase of elections on April 29.” Special work officer, SEC, S K Singh has issued a letter to all the DMs, SPs and district electoral officers to check the truth about the deaths of the teachers being reported in their district and provide a report within 24 hours. Sharma said they are yet to receive information on the health of teachers on election duties from several districts like Fatehpur, Balrampur, Shamli, Aligarh and Hamirpur. “I am afraid about the numbers. Their families are also affected. The situation is extremely critical,” he said. “We had requested the SEC, after there was a surge in cases on April 12, to postpone the polls but our request was ignored. We may be forced to boycott counting duty,” added Sharma. District presidents of another union, Rashtriya Shaikshik Mahasangh, have also given a memorandum to the SEC’s office in all the districts of the state. In Bijnor, 4,000 government employees, including teachers, have been deputed for vote counting but there’s widespread fear among them. Senior vice-president of UP Primary Teacher association, Rajendra Singh, said, “Polls have already done the damage. Now counting may wreak more havoc. We are living in fear.” Employees who have been selected for counting duty are working overtime to get their names removed from the list but with little success. In fact, officials went ahead and organised a training session for the staff on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/unions-give-names-of-577-teachers-who-died-during-panchayat-poll-duty-to-sec/articleshow/82297658.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Nagpur||Kapoor’s khichdi daily feeds 400 poor from even before pandemic||NAGPUR: Crisis situations often churn out some good Samaritans. Jamshed Singh Kapoor, 41, is one among them. Kapoor has been distributing ‘daal khichdi’ to the poor city in these devastating times. One can easily spot Kapoor wearing a white T-shirt having ‘Langar Seva’ (free food service) printed on the back. He loads the meals on his two-wheeler and moves from Law College Square to Kasturchand Park every evening serving food to the poor and needy and sometimes to even those from well to do families. He has a big container tied to the pillion seat and a couple of bags while feeding people. He claims he has been engaged in this social service since 2013, even on Sundays, without break. Every day, he claims to serve hot ‘dal khichdi’ to approximately 400 persons. Ever since stricter restrictions were imposed, his services are much sought after as all eateries and restaurants are closed and food has become scarce. For some it is ‘dal-khichdi’, for others, a divine blessing handed out by Kapoor. He dismisses any risk of contracting the virus. “Why not do some noble work before any eventuality happens,” he asks. “Even my family, including two sons, object to my social service in this pandemic. But I tell them that people are dying without moving out of home.Why should I not help the deprived people, particularly in this emergency when everything is closed,” he says. Kapoor’s dream is to have a round-the-clock langar where he can cater to all sections of the society. “Citizens’ right from the beggars to slum dwellers to rickshaw pullers, to even those moving in cars stop at my langar and I never say no to anyone. Many times, they ask for multiple servings,” he says. Kapoor, whois also an astrologer, starts preparations for ‘dal khichdi’ all by himself. “Till last year, I was helped by a small team in this endeavour, but after a pandemic struck, the team members are apprehensive of contracting the virus. So, I do it all by myself and without any break. I don’t return home until every morsel finds a hungry stomach,” he adds. Kapoor says he is only following the preachings of Guru Nanak that greatest service to humanity is to satisfy hunger of those in need. “Guru Nanak Devji had visited Nagpur in 1512 on the way to the south where he had served food to Gond tribals in those days, as per our elders. I am not only inspired by him but also by Mahatma Gandhi who too preached service to the poor. I am helped by my team members and other donors, who give rice, pulses and vegetables for our Seva,” he says. Twitter post on him gets 1.5mn hits A Twitter post with his photo of a poor man posted by management guru Sanjay Arora has garnered over 1.5 million views in the last couple of days. It was retweeted over 5,700 times, liked by over 27,000 users and has over 350 comments from across the globe. Many hail him a “real hero” and a “silent warrior”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/kapoors-khichdi-daily-feeds-400-poor-from-even-before-pandemic/articleshow/82299819.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Inquiry revealed that one of the cars involved in the accident was ferrying a consignment of countrymade liquor. The Sabarmatis police said two cars rammed into each other between Chainpur and Jagatpur crossings. The cops reached the spot and were about to check the vehicle when the crowd assembled there began pelting them with marbles and stones. Some of them used catapults to attack the cops. The cops ran for cover and waited inside the police vehicle till the situation calmed down. Two men from the police party received minor injuries. Later, the team took possession of the car used to smuggle liquor.

Both major towns Warangal and Khammam have been reporting nearly 700 and 500 cases respectively every day. Polling for Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation, Khammam Municipal Corporation and five other municipalities will be held on April 30 and results will be out on May 3. Sources in municipal administration department said that in 2016 elections, Greater Warangal registered only 58% and Khammam corporation had 68% turnout. Going by the current situation, the officials are expecting less than 50% polling in the civic elections. “Generally, in the towns, voters do not come out of their houses to vote in comparison to rural areas. In GHMC elections, the turnout was only 45% whereas 88% polling was recorded in just held Nagarjuna Sagar byelections,” a senior official said. With the fear of Covid-19 cases looming, the electorate was not given voter slips. Worried over poor voting and how low turnout could derail the winning chances of their candidates, all political parties are asking leaders and workers to see that people come out and vote in huge numbers. “We have asked booth-level workers to call up each voter and come to booth to utilise their franchise,” a senior TRS leader, who is party in-charge in GWMC, said. Interestingly, some parties are even facing problems to get election agents to sit in the polling booths and during counting also.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/low-turnout-worry-for-parties-ahead-of-polls/articleshow/82299791.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Vaccine shortage might hit drive in industrial areas||JAIPUR: Keeping in view the concentration of people, the state government has allowed vaccination drives in industrial areas and for workers of individual companies which employ large number of people. Vaccination sessions have already been conducted in Mansarovar industrial area and Vishwakarma Industrial area. In the coming week, vaccination sessions for workers in Sitapura industrial area will be conducted. In response to a request by CII-Rajasthan, the medical, health and family welfare department had mentioned that in places where more than 100 people can be vaccinated, the district administration can conduct sessions. The first drive was conducted in Mansarovar industrial area where 250 employees belonging to various units got vaccinated. Similarly, the second session was held in VKI on Wednesday where more than 300 workers got vaccinated. “While there are about 1.5 lakh workers engaged in VKI, all are not eligible. People above 45 years of age are given vaccination. In the first session, about 350 employees of the industrial area got vaccinated. A similar number is getting the jabs on Wednesday,” said Tarachand Choudhary, president of VKI area. Sitapura Industrial area has also written to the CHMO for a date which is expected to be in the first week of May. “We will get a date during the first week of May. Our association has asked the members to send the details of their employees so that their registration can be done,” said Nilesh Agarwal, president of the association. Agarwal said they had facilities required for vaccination in their association office. Federation of Rajasthan Handicraft Exporters also written a letter to the medical department for vaccination of workers in units where more than 100 people work. “A big chunk of workers fall in the age group of 18-45, who are eligible in the phase-3 of the vaccination drive. There are units that engage several hundreds of workers. We are ready to provide all facilities but want the government allocate the vaccines required,” said Atul Podar, president of FORHEX. Sessions have already been conducted at some individual companies which employ more than couple of hundreds of people. But it seems vaccine shortage will be a handicap for the government to meet the demand of the industry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-starts-vaccination-at-industrial-areas-but-vaccine-shortage-to-hit-drive/articleshow/82298787.cms||---

Either some patients did not get full course of Remdesivir or received it with interruptions. As per data of the district administration, 53,923 doses of Remdesivir were received between April 10 and 27. There were 1,36,633 functional beds in these 18 days. Thus, 39.47% of required number of doses were received. The district did not get a single dose on three days — April 18, 20 and 24. Also, the district received doses equivalent to total number of functional beds only on one day, April 12. The district receives doses from seven companies, but none of the companies supplied vials on all days. Convener of Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA) Dr Anup Marar told TOI, “It is very clear from the data of district administration that only 40% Remdesivir was allocated to the district as against the number of admitted Covid-19 patients. Many days, there was no supply. Someday, it is in range of 20-50%. Considering that nowadays only group E and F Covid patients i.e. those with oxygen saturation level below 94%, are getting admitted, the dosage of 2-1-1-1-1 has to be strictly followed for patients as per guidelines,” he said. “Relatives of patients shout at hapless Covid teams of the hospitals when patients do not get Remdesivir. Most times, dosages cannot be executed as per guidelines. Over and above, authorities verbally threaten to file criminal action if prescriptions are issued. A doctor is bound to issue prescription. It is the responsibility of patient or government to bring the medicines and consumables. If later on patients file cases against the hospitals for non-provision of treatment as per guidelines affecting the patient, who will be responsible,” he questioned. He also said, “Private hospitals are alarmed at these developments and indifferent attitude of authorities.” Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said, “Availability of Remdesivir’s two doses on first day and one each on next four days is very important for recovery of patients and reduction in duration of hospitalization. Interruptions in doses will led to further spread in infection and may also land patients in critical stage. It also means delay in discharge of patients, which means one more bed remaining occupied. At present, availability of beds is a major problem. Therefore, hospitals should get uninterrupted and sufficient quantity of doses.” The district administration is yet to consider private Covid Care Centres (CCCs) for distribution of Remdesivir despite these CCCs admitting patients with CT score of 8-10 considering shortage of beds in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dist-got-only-40-of-required-remdesivir-doses-in-18-days/articleshow/82298800.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

With efforts of Barmer collector Lok Bandhu Yadav and revenue minister Harish Choudhary, 13 tankers of various companies have been acquired for transporting oxygen. These tankers from Barmer will ply to different parts of the state to transport oxygen. Choudhary said for transportation of oxygen, the Barmer district administration and public representatives made efforts and arranged for 13 tankers, which will prove to be helpful in oxygen transportation. He said Barmer district had played an important role in the oxygen transport chain. He said in coming days, all possible efforts will be made to increase the number of tankers. Three oxygen plants in Pachpadra will soon start producing 3,000 cylinders per day, which will not only fulfil the demand of the district, but could be sent to other districts also. Barmer district administration on Tuesday night sent these tankers for oxygen transportation. Collector Lok Bandhu Yadav said it was a big contribution of Barmer not only for the state, but for the country. These tankers were put to use for different works at oil, gas and coal companies. These tankers are of different capacities of 7, 10 and 12 tonne and the tankers of around 100 tonne have also been acquired. Now, these oxygen tankers can be sent directly to hospitals from Jamnagar and Bhiwadi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/13-tankers-from-barmer-to-help-with-oxygen-tranportation/articleshow/82298792.cms||---

Police have picked up three men - Adnan Ahmad, Mohd Aftab and Hashim Ahmed - from near the Regional Transport Office (RTO). Three vials have been recovered from them, police sources said. All three work in the medical field. Civil Lines circle officer (CO) Devesh Singh said, "We received a tip-off that workers from nearby hospitals were indulging in black marketing of the drugs. And a deal was to be made near the RTO office. We laid a trap and nabbed the three culprits on Tuesday evening." Police sources said the gang's kingpin is an operation theatre in-charge of a private hospital and has been identified as one Tazim. He is currently at large, the CO added. The latest arrest comes days after police held two ward boys of another private hospital where cops went in as "customers". They arrested the duo after exchanging Rs 25,000 as promised. Six security guards who allegedly tried to protect the staff and confronted the cops were also held. In another recent incident, three staffers of a prominent hospital in Hapur district were arrested on charges of selling the vial in black market. A vial and Rs 82,000 in cash were recovered from them. They had already managed to sell 4-5 vials at higher prices before they were caught.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/another-remdesivir-racket-busted-in-up/articleshow/82297674.cms||Sandeep Rai

While the SN Medical College administration has pushed for setting up an oxygen generation plant, one of the three stalled since six months, a financial aid has come from Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhwat for the one at MG Hospital. On Tuesday, Shekhawat arranged a sum of Rs 1.5 crore through CSR for the MG Hospital oxygen generation plant, apart from providing two ventilators, five monitors and some key equipment. “This amount of Rs 1.5 crore has been generated through CSR funds of some corporates and has already been credited to the account of the hospital,” Shekhawat said, adding that the plant will be set up soon. Shekhawat, who was on a visit to MG Hospital, a dedicated Covid centre, on Tuesday, was apprised of the dire need of an oxygen plant by the hospital administration. Superintendent of MG Hospital Rajshree Behra did not respond to calls. But according to experts, the task is not expected to be accomplished in next 3-4 weeks, which means there will not be any immediate reprieve for patients dying for want of oxygen. On the other hand, civil work has resumed for an oxygen generation plant at MDM Hospital, which had been stalled since December. Covid incharge for MDM hospital Vikas Rajpurohit said that the civil work for foundation for the plant has been completed and they are waiting for the unit to arrive for installation. According to the sources, the order for the unit has already been placed, but it will take atleast a week to arrive and another 3-4 days for installation and commissioning. On the other hand, patients and hospitals here are solely dependent on the oxygen supply from outstation plants like Bhiwadi and Jamnagar. On Wednesday also, two tankers bearing 12.78 tonnes and 17 tonnes oxygen reached Jodhpur. But all these efforts are falling way short of the requirement. Government hospitals, however, have been receiving oxygen from these tankers, but condition at private hospitals is worse, who have been constantly referring patients requiring oxygen to the government hospitals in critical condition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rs-1-5cr-csr-fund-for-hosp-to-build-oxygen-generation-unit/articleshow/82298802.cms||---

The fifth-generation infra-red guided Python-5 missiles, which have a range of around 20 km, will add to the air-to-air combat capability of Tejas. The Israeli Derby beyond visual range missiles, with a 50-km range, had earlier been integrated with the fighter. “The test-firing of the two missiles at Goa completed a series of trials to validate their performance under extremely challenging scenarios. The Derby missile achieved a direct hit on a high-speed manoeuvering aerial target. The Python missiles also achieved 100% hits, thereby validating their complete capability,” said a DRDO official. Prior to the actual test-firings, extensive missile carriage flight tests were conducted at Bengaluru to assess the integration of the Python-5 with aircraft systems on board the Tejas, ranging from avionics and fire-control radars to missile weapon delivery and flight control systems. “After successful separation trials at Goa, the live launch of the Python on a Banshee target was carried out. In all the live firings, the missile hit the aerial targets,” said the official. The Indian Air Force is slated to induct 83 new Tejas, including 10 trainers, in the 2024-2028 timeframe under the Rs 46,898 crore deal inked with defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics in February this year. The 73 new Tejas Mark-1A jets will have 43 “improvements” over the 40 Mark-1 jets ordered by IAF earlier||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/israeli-missiles-give-tejas-more-firepower/articleshow/82301464.cms||---

The plan includes establishment of 13 plants for hospitals with varying bed capacity. Additionally, 200 oxygen concentrators are also expected to be bought from disaster relief fund. The meeting was held by Covid in charge from the district administration and officiating DM, Roshan Jacob, during which quotations were invited for the purpose. In another meeting, officials were directed to ensure that RRT (rapid response teams) of various community health centres (CHCs) increase sampling of Covid-19 patients and their families. The chief medical officer (CMO) has been asked to provide medicines to affected families the very next day they test positive and conduct antigen testing of close contacts. To increase bed capacity for Covid-19 patients, two hospitals – Mahatma Gandhi Hospital (60 beds) in Chinhat and Combined Hospital, Thakurganj, have been identified. The DM also carried out inspection of the hospitals on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/admin-sets-ball-rolling-for-oxygen-plants-in-hospitals/articleshow/82299782.cms||---

It was filed by advocate Fayzan Khan and three law students, aggrieved at “varying charges” announced by Serum Institute of India to give each dose of Covidshield for Rs400 to states and Rs600 to private hospitals. Bharat Biotech’s announced Covaxin rates at Rs600 for states and Rs1,200 to private hospitals. The petitioners annexed a comparative chart that showed the vaccine was cheaper in some other countries. “This denotes that pharma companies are milking fear psychosis of increased death rates due to Covid-19,’’ said the PIL filed through advocate Vivek Shukla. It said increased rates were “not realistic and arising out of exigency”, but are intended to be an “organised loot” taking advantage of coronavirus threat to Indians. “Combating coronavirus pandemic is of national interest and private entities like SII cannot be given control over health of citizens,” it asserted. It cautioned that a huge difference in cost of vaccines was bound to promote illegal storage and black-marketing. It urged HC to direct Centre and state government to ensure it is for Rs150 a dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-now-pil-seeks-rs-150-per-dose-uniform-rate-for-vaccines/articleshow/82299802.cms||Rosy Sequeira

The mob also damaged the team’s diagnostic kit. The team was sent to the village as 10 Covid cases were detected there a day before. Saurabh Chaudhary, the driver in the team, was the worst-hit. He was attacked by a sharp-edged weapon that caused a deep gash on the right side of his forehead. Shikha Singh, medical officer, said, “We are a team of three and had gone to Kirthal village to explain home isolation and home isolate a few families whose members had tested Covid positive a day before. But we were confronted by a group of angry villagers, particularly the youth. They levelled baseless allegations against us that our reports were fake and we were unnecessarily harassing the residents. They even manhandled our senior, Doctor Mansoor Ahmad, and our driver was hit when he tried to save me from the agitated crowd. He was hit with a sharp-edged weapon that led to profuse bleeding near the right eye. Things did not stop at that level. Our diagnostic kits, including rapid antigen testing kits, were also damaged and crushed under their feet.” The team has lodged a written complaint at Ramala police station and investigations are on in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/2-hurt-as-village-youths-attack-covid-response-team-damage-medical-kit-in-baghpat/articleshow/82297684.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Chandigarh||Amarinder must get a survey of his own image done, says Pargat after MLAs’ meet||Chandigarh: Congress MLA from Jalandhar (Cantonment) Pargat Singh on Wednesday hit out at his own Congress government over the Kotkapura firing case, adding that chief minister Amarinder Singh’s own image had taken a hit. “I suggested to the CM that he should get a survey of his own image (as the CM) done. In 2017, the election was fought in his name. We will know where we stand today. Today, the idea seems to be to bury every issue,” he said. The former Indian hockey skipper, who is considered to be close to former Cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu said, “MLAs of Doaba region met with the chief minister today. In 2017, it was a personality-based election and we had promised action on the sacrilege issue. People voted for Amarinder Singh and not the Congress party. But four years hence, we haven’t moved forward.” “The state government had no interference in the SIT. At the same time, when 2-3 members of the SIT stopped participating in the investigations, someone has to take responsibility. Being the home minister, Amarinder Singh should take responsibility. During the last term, the same CM had acted against Ravi Sidhu. The perception was clear. If there is no intent (to act) then what will happen. It’s been four years; we have to face the people. The ministers were asked to resign if they want but how will they defend this issue. What will they tell people?” he added. “When we go for meetings, they tell us technical things about what all happened. I am a hockey captain and even when I played well individually, as captain, I had a responsibility. The SIT (members) fought publicly for three months and it was bound to have an impact. Who had to handle that?” asked Pargat. “In the last few days, ministers too have been criticised. I said have you left the ministers in a position to speak. What is public perception? I told Amarinder that time is precious, and we need to face the problem. We should at least introspect and try to find a solution. Window dressing will not help, the accused should be taken to task as perception is the key,” he added. Pargat also referred to the letter he had written to the chief minister in 2019 wherein he had listed certain issues. “What all is happening are not things expected from an administrator like Amarinder Singh. I think other MLAs also see reason with me. Otherwise, why aren’t they defending the government openly? We should stay focused on the issue and try to improve the perception. Ultimately, it is about getting justice (in the sacrilege case),” he said. “It’s not the same Captain as in the previous tenure… A perception among people is that Badals and Captain are together. Who will break that perception? It’s for the government to do that. Amarinder could have played his last inning well, but he didn’t,” he said, adding that setting up a mining board could be admitting the problem in a way. CM’s challenge to Sidhu won’t solve sacrilege issue On Amarinder’s challenge to former cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu on Tuesday that he was welcome to contest against him from Patiala, Pargat said: “The CM is a fatherly figure, we should not get into this. Even if both the CM and Navjot fight from Patiala, will it solve the (sacrilege) issue? It doesn’t suit a big leader to say such things.” Letter leaked from CMO Referring to his letter to the CM in 2019, Pargat said it got leaked from the office of the chief minister and he had not gone to the media. “They themselves create indiscipline. Then they ask us not to go to the media. But they themselves create indiscipline... Before that, I was not given an appointment for more than a month... Internal democracy seems to be disappearing,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/amarinder-must-get-a-survey-of-his-own-image-done-says-pargat-after-mlas-meet/articleshow/82299792.cms||Vibhor Mohan

The youth, who worked at a private company, died almost an hour after the video went viral. Vikas’s family said while they thought doctors are God, they have seen a different side of the health system and lost all faith in it. Heart-breaking: Kin of Covid-19 patients beg Noida CMO for RemdesivirTOI reported on Tuesday about a video in which a group of women family members of Covid patients could be seen touching the CMO’s feet pleading for the Remdesivir injection. Rinku Devi, a resident of Khora, was one of them. She had come to plead for the injection for his son Vikas who had been admitted to Shivalik hospital in Sector 51. Vikas’s maternal aunt Reena Devi said that she had first gone to the CMO office to ask for the injection for her nephew. “We begged and cried but to no avail. I had told the CMO that if I don’t get the injection, I will come again. I was told that if I come again, I would be put in jail,” she said. After that, Reena’s sister Rinku too went to the CMO office to plead for the injection. However, around 4.30pm, Rinku’s son died at Shivalik hospital. “He complained of chest pain on Friday suddenly and we took him to Shivalik hospital on Saturday morning. He was fine on Sunday but on Monday, his condition started deteriorating again. He was prescribed Remdesivir but we could not get it despite all efforts,” Reena said. Reena said that they had thought doctors were God but the experience had shattered them. “My sister has lost her only son. Vikas was the only brother to two sisters. He could have been saved but we got no help from anywhere,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/woman-who-touched-cmos-feet-to-get-remdesivir-loses-24-year-old-son/articleshow/82300912.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Meerut||Unions give names of ‘577 teachers who died during panchayat poll duty’ to SEC||BAREILLY/BIJNOR: Various teachers’ unions in UP came together on Wednesday to give a list of “577 teachers and support staff who died while doing panchayat poll duty in the state” to the Uttar Pradesh State Election Commission (UPSEC).  The unions have now asked teachers to stay away on counting day, May 2. TOI has a copy of the letter prepared by Dinesh Chandra Sharma, president of UP Shikshak Mahasangh (UPSM), that has names and addresses of the 577 teachers and shiksha mitras. On Tuesday, the Allahabad HC had sent a notice to the SEC seeking explanation on Covid preparedness and the alleged deaths. A senior teacher’s union leader said, “To be honest, the court’s issuance of the notice has not benefited teachers because the next date of hearing in this case is May 3, which is a day after counting day. What was needed was postponement of counting at least, if not the fourth phase of elections on April 29.” Special work officer, SEC, S K Singh has issued a letter to all the DMs, SPs and district electoral officers to check the truth about the deaths of the teachers being reported in their district and provide a report within 24 hours. Sharma said they are yet to receive information on the health of teachers on election duties from several districts like Fatehpur, Balrampur, Shamli, Aligarh and Hamirpur. “I am afraid about the numbers. Their families are also affected. The situation is extremely critical,” he said. “We had requested the SEC, after there was a surge in cases on April 12, to postpone the polls but our request was ignored. We may be forced to boycott counting duty,” added Sharma. District presidents of another union, Rashtriya Shaikshik Mahasangh, have also given a memorandum to the SEC’s office in all the districts of the state. In Bijnor, 4,000 government employees, including teachers, have been deputed for vote counting but there’s widespread fear among them. Senior vice-president of UP Primary Teacher association, Rajendra Singh, said, “Polls have already done the damage. Now counting may wreak more havoc. We are living in fear.” Employees who have been selected for counting duty are working overtime to get their names removed from the list but with little success.

Police said the accused would source the vials from a lab technician working with AIIMS in Delhi and a contractual employee at the chief medical officer’s (CMO) office in Noida, who are yet to be arrested. While two of the four accused are law students, another works with a pharmacy and the other is a physiotherapist. The accused — identified as Shubham Goyal, Vaibhav Sharma, Shivam Sharma and Yogendra Singh — were arrested from near Kailash hospital in Greater Noida. Two 100mg vials of Hetero Remdesivir injections were recovered from their possession. A Honda Civic and Rs 49,600 in cash were also seized, police said. Knowledge Park SHO Sanjay Singh told TOI that the accused were involved in the sale of Remdesivir injections for the past 15-20 days outside Greater Noida hospitals. “Sumit, a lab technician working at AIIMS, and Vikas Kaushik, a contractual employee of the health department, provided the four with the jabs. The role of the others was to trap the family members of Covid patients admitted at different hospitals and charge them up to Rs 1.5 lakh,” he said. The accused sold one jab on Tuesday to relatives of a patient outside Kailash hospital, the SHO said. While Shivam is a physiotherapist from the Jaitpur area of Greater Noida, Shubham Goyal and Vaibhav Sharma are law students at a private college of Greater Noida. Bulandshahr native Yogendra is a supplier for a local chemist. Additional DCP (Greater Noida) Vishal Pandey said Sunil and Vikas would take away the bigger share of the sale while the four arrested accused would get the customers and a commission. Police said the batch number of the jabs was yet to be checked and hence, it was unclear which manufacturing unit they were produced at. The accused have been booked under IPC sections 420 (cheating), 120b (conspiracy) and the Drug and Cosmetics Act, Epidemic Diseases Act and Disaster Management Act. Earlier, the crime branch had arrested a man named Rachit Ghai for selling Remdesivir injections to patients’ kin across NCR after sourcing it from agents in Chandigarh and Delhi’s Dwarka, and recovered 105 vials of Hetero Healthcare and Cipla-made injections from him. He had been charging up to Rs 40,000 for a vial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/remdesivir-vials-sold-for-up-to-rs-1-5l-outside-gr-noida-hospitals/articleshow/82300906.cms||Shikha Salaria

The announcement was made as part of the company’s filings with the BSE and NSE. “As part of the car manufacturing process, Maruti Suzuki uses a small amount of oxygen in its factories while relatively larger quantities are used by the manufacturers of components. In the current situation, we believe all available oxygen should be used to save lives,” a statement issued by SMG said. “Production in all factories will close for maintenance during this period. Accordingly, Maruti Suzuki has decided to advance its maintenance shutdown, originally scheduled for June, to May 1-9,” the statement adds. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/smgs-hansalpur-plant-to-produce-medical-oxygen/articleshow/82299813.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Teachers demand complete switch to work from home||AHMEDABAD: At a time when advisories by doctors and the state government insist people to stay within the confines of their homes and not venture outside until unavoidable, schools and colleges are seeing about half the faculty and other staff members attending their workplaces. This has drawn the ire of parents and faculty members, many of who have demanded the government to shut down the institutions and announce work from home for all the school and college employees. The large queues outside hospitals and crematoriums are enough signs to indicate that the second wave has hit the people of Gujarat hard. On Tuesday Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani in an appeal to all the people of Gujarat, said that people should avoid venturing out of their houses for the next seven to eight days to break the chain of the virus transmissions. Digvijaysinh Jadeja of the Primary Teachers’ Association said that in the second wave of Covid-19, many schoolteachers have been infected. The situation is bad not only in urban centres but also in rural areas, he said. “When online teaching is going on and government has ordered shut down of schools and colleges due to the Covid-19 situation, why should teachers and other staff members be forced to attend their workplaces. We demand the government to close down these institutions and completely switch to work from home,” said Jadeja. Many teachers have been assigned duties that require them to venture outside their homes. For about a year now, about 1,100 teachers of AMC-run schools have been engaged by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) for various Covid-19 duties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/teachers-demand-complete-switch-to-work-from-home/articleshow/82298820.cms||Bharat Yagnik

The findings, led by the University of Birmingham and University College London (UCL), showed that the rise in PM2.5 and NO2 reflect increasing vehicle ownership, industrialisation and the limited effect of air pollution policies to date. This contrasts with trends in the UK’s London and Birmingham, which show modest, but ongoing declines in PM2.5 and NOx, reflecting the success of policies targeting sources that emit these pollutants. The study, published in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, also showed increases in the air pollutant formaldehyde in Delhi, Kanpur and London. ians||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pm2-5-no2-rising-in-delhi-kanpur-study/articleshow/82317523.cms||---

The registration option on the Aarogya Setu mobile app too didn’t work, they said.Those who were able to get themselves registered said no appointments were available for booking. Wednesday was the first day for registrations for the upcoming phase of vaccinations from May 1, nationwide.“Attempts to get a registration done on the Aarogya Setu app fell flat as the pathway to reach the registration page was not available. The app also displayed a notice saying those under 45 are not eligible for the jab,” Manish Kumar, a resident of Noida Extension, said. The district administrations of Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad have not updated any details on the session sites for the new vaccination drive. Officials didn’t respond to queries by TOI.Lakhs of people in both districts will be eligible for Covid jabs in the upcoming phase. Many residents had been trying to log on since Wednesday morning, but the registration window opened only at 4pm. A handful got themselves registered then, but couldn’t book a slot. “I have got myself registered on the portal and am now waiting for the appointment slot, which has not been allocated yet,” Ankit Gupta, a resident of Indirapuram, said.“I couldn’t complete registration as the portal was not accepting the one-time password (OTP) I received,” Gautam Pandey, a Noida Extension resident, said.Shyam Kumar, another Noida Extension resident, said: “The site hung multiple times. Some managed to get themselves registered. Many others will be trying in the days to come.”“I waited for an hour after 4pm as I thought there would be a rush. But even after that I failed to get registration done. There might have been some technical problem because of which the portal wasn’t responding,” said Shivangi Mishra, a Kavi Nagar resident. “The page would just not open and after an hour of futile attempts, I gave up. I was later told that there was an official response saying that the system had crashed,” said Santosh Mondal, who lives in Vaishali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/co-win-gates-open-but-no-vaccination-slots-for-18/articleshow/82300916.cms||Sharmila Bhowmick
---||Lucknow||As temp soars, patients’ kin feel the heat in long refill queues||Lucknow: Despite scorching April sun, long queues outside oxygen manufacturing plants from day break till evening continued for the eighth day in a row on Wednesday. Most people in the queues were either those who had a Covid-19 patient with low oxygen levels at home or those whose family members were under treatment in private hospitals which have asked them to get a refill. There were also some whose family members suffer from other respiratory diseases and need oxygen support occasionally, hence they have to keep a full cylinder on standby all the time. Sanjay Singh of Munshipulia in Indirangar, who was standing outside an oxygen plant in Nadarganj, said he reached there early morning but distribution for individuals started around noon. “It is 2pm now and the way the queue is moving, I will have to wait at least for two more hours,” he said. Singh had come for a refill for a relative admitted in a private hospital in Khurramnagar. Gaurav Bhatia of Yahiyaganj, who was waiting in a queue outside a plant in Talkatora, had come to get a refill for his Covid-19 positive grandfather battling for life at home. “I have been standing here since 10am. It has been four hours now but distribution to individuals has not started. The plant is first refilling cylinders in vehicles sent by hospitals,” he said. Anjani Prasad’s wife suffers from chronic asthma and needs oxygen support when her condition deteriorates. “I have been running from one plant to another for the last two days with no luck. I am 55-year-old and have diabetes. My health also does not allow me to take much strain. Since there is nobody else in the house, I have to run around for oxygen. My regular supplier who used to deliver at home refused this time saying he has no oxygen left as the entire lot is being sent for Covid care,” he said. BJP MLA loses son to Covid, alleges oxygen shortage in hosp: BJP MLA from Sandila, Raj Kumar Agarwal, on Wednesday lodged a complaint of medical negligence at Kakori police station against a private hospital on IIM Road. He alleged that his son, Ashish, who was Covid-19 positive, died on April 26 due to shortage of oxygen in the hospital. He alleged that one of the doctors in the hospital even refused to take oxygen cylinders arranged by his family. “There were more victims like my son and the police must check the hospital’s CCTV to verify it,” he said. SHO, Kakori, Kuldeep Singh Gaur said the CMO had been informed about the allegations for investigation. “The CMO will form a panel to conduct a probe after which legal action will be taken,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/as-temp-soars-patients-kin-feel-the-heat-in-long-refill-queues/articleshow/82299821.cms||Pranchal Srivastava

Subodh Uniyal, state agriculture minister and government spokesperson, said, “A dose of Covishield costs Rs 400 in government facilities and that of Covaxin comes for Rs 600. In the first phase, we are ordering 25 lakh doses of Covishield and 2.5 lakh vials of Covaxin. The director-general (health) and director (medical health) have been authorised to make the advance payment to the vaccine manufacturers and get the other formalities done.” The minister added that secretary (industries) Sachin Kurve has been asked to coordinate with both the vaccine manufacturing companies — Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute of India — and ensure a smooth inoculation drive. Earlier on April 26, the Uttarakhand government had approved Rs 450 crore to provide free Covid-19 vaccination to an estimated 50 lakh state residents falling in the age bracket of 18-to-45 years. Out of these 50 lakh (estimated) locals, 90% would be administered Covisheild and the remaining 10% are to be given Covaxin. Meanwhile, several people faced issues while trying to register themselves online for Covid-19 vaccination on Wednesday. Only the people above 45 years of age have been given an appointment for vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-orders-25-lakh-covishield-2-5-lakh-covaxin-for-the-first-leg-of-adult-vaccination/articleshow/82297713.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Chandigarh||Accused held guilty in Kotkhai rape-murder case||Shimla: A court of special judge on Wednesday convicted a woodcutter in the shocking four-year-old Gudiya rape and murder case. Anil Kumar alias Neelu Charani was held guilty on all four charges. The quantum of the sentence will be pronounced on May 11. A girl studying in Class X had gone missing while returning home from school on July 4, 2017. Two days later, her naked body was recovered from the Dandhi forest area of Kotkhai in the district, sparking outrage and massive protests across the state. In the hearing on April 16, only arguments were held. The court of special judge Rajeev Bhardwaj had posted the matter for Wednesday. The court held the accused guilty under sections 302, 376 (2)(i) and 376 (A) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 4 of Pocso Act. The prosecution was able to establish the presence of the accused near the crime scene. The post-mortem report had gone against him too. Soil samples had shown the offence was committed at the spot where the body was recovered. The DNA samples of the accused matched with those lifted from the crime spot, according to a report. A dental report had suggested bite marks on the body of the victim were of the accused. The court, however, did not accept the plea that the accused had a criminal history and sought a psychological report. The case was initially investigated by Shimla police but following the violent protests in July 2017 after the custodial death of an arrested suspect, the state high court had handed over the case to the CBI that had registered the case on July 22, 2017. The CBI had claimed to have solved the case with the arrest of Anil Kumar on April 13, 2018. However, the parents of the girl kept on claiming more people were involved in the crime, who, they said, are still roaming free.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/accused-held-guilty-in-kotkhai-rape-murder-case/articleshow/82299834.cms||---

The state has 72,000 monitoring committees in rural and urban areas. Yogi said that prevention is extremely important in the fight against Covid-19 and praised ASHA and anganwadi workers, members of yuvak mangal dal, mahila mangal dal and civil defence for the good work they were doing. “During the first wave, monitoring committees played a crucial role. More than 40 lakh migrant workers returned to the state then and monitoring committees ensured their quarantine, maintained dialogue with home isolation patients, helped with food distribution etc,” he said. The CM said that UP had adopted the right policy against Covid-19. Monitoring committees had a huge contribution in ensuring that people got timely treatment. He said that all committees should have infrared thermometers, pulse oxymeters and sanitisers. These committees should tell people that all positive patients need not get admitted to hospitals, exactly how not all Covid patients need oxygen, ventilator or Remdesivir. They have also been tasked with distribution of medical kits to Covid patients who are in home isolation. Quarantine centres in villages should be set up in schools, panchayat bhawans or any other community hall etc. Food, sanitation, security etc should be arranged for. The monitoring committees have also been tasked with ensuring that there are no crowds at vaccination centres when vaccination opens up for all above the age of 18 years from May 1. A pre-determined number of persons must be allowed at the centres each day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-yogi-hails-work-of-nigrani-samitis/articleshow/82299841.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

As many as 1,904 people out of 1,18,020 infected with the virus died between April 1 to 28 — 2.83 deaths per hour, worse than previous highest hourly death count of 2.63 recorded in September last year. In March, 1.39 deaths per hour were reported. Barring April 3 when 49 people lost their lives to the virus, the death count has been well over 50. A total of 142 people succumbed to Covid on April 28, the deadliest day since the start of the pandemic. The rate of death has increased in recent weeks as the last seven days accounted for over 33% of the death toll reported in April so far. Of 589 deaths, Amritsar contributed the highest of 76 deaths followed by Ludhiana where 64 people died, 62 in Patiala and 56 in Mohali. The trend is expected to continue in the coming weeks as there has been a sharp rise in the number of new patients getting critically ill and requiring ventilator and intensive care unit (ICU) support. As on April 28, 97 patients were in critical condition and ventilator support while 700 on oxygen support. Since January 1 to April 27, as many as 3,289 people have died in Punjab which is the fifth-highest count in the country after Maharashtra 16,658, 4473 in Delhi, 4,411 in Chhattisgarh, 3326 in Uttar Pradesh.

The local grocer hesitated to supply essentials, neighbors avoided crossing their house and friends refused to help in any way.  That is when Sethi, a Nainital-based businessman, decided he wouldn’t be the same and instead lend a hand to affected people. Now that the second wave has hit the state, Sethi, with the help of his friends and relatives, is helping people get access to blood plasma and oxygen. He has himself donated plasma seven times in the last four months. Talking about the time he and his family spent in isolation, Sethi said, “Those were the most horrible three weeks of our lives. For 20 days , we could not step out of our home. Our neighbors completely ignored us. We decided we would be different and help people in need by whatever means possible.” Sethi has now created WhatsApp and Facebook groups with over 300 members from across the state. “Every day, we receive hundreds of messages and calls. I have friends coming from across the state who are donating plasma,” he said. With his car accessories shop in Doon being closed due to the lockdown, the family is struggling financially. “For the last several months, I haven’t been able to take out any time for my family, including my eight-year-old daughter. My shop was closed because of Covid curbs and the curfew has made it even worse,” Sethi said. He added that it was still difficult to convince people to donate their blood plasma. “No one wants to donate to a stranger in need. I request all of those people who have recovered to come forward and help everyone in need,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/man-who-faced-boycott-when-he-tested-positive-now-helps-infected-people-access-plasma-oxygen/articleshow/82297766.cms||Prashant Jha

The constituencies of Port, Bhowanipore, Ballygunge and Rashbehari registered 64.4%, 61.3%, 61% and 59.8% polling percentage, which parties said, were the worst in the past several elections. Worried, poll managers in Jorasanko, Entally, Chowringhee, Maniktala, Beliaghta, Belgachhia and Shyampukur in north Kolkata have been spending the past two days, identifying pockets, where they would need to mobilize their organisational machinery to convince voters to step out and cast their ballot. North Kolkata is a mix of diverse population from different parts of the country, including the business community in Burrabazar, Chinese in Tiretta Market, Anglo Indians in Bowbazar and a substantial Muslim population spread across several wards. It also has a big migrant population from neighbouring states working in wholesale and retail markets and associated with transportation of goods. “The low polling percentage is a cause for concern. Despite aggressive campaigns, rallies and local connect, it all boils down to which party can mobilise its voters on the voting day. If voters do not step out due to the virus fear, it will not be a good sign,” said a campaign manager of a BJP candidate. It is also a challenge for the EC to conduct polls under the fear of the virus and widespread criticism from various quarters, including the judiciary. “We have abandoned old premises, which were used for polling for decades because of insufficient space . Like all other phases, there will be thermal scanning and sanitisation at the booths. Voters will also be provided with gloves,” said a returning officer. Since Tuesday morning, candidates in constituencies, like Jorasanko, Entally, Chowringhee, Maniktala, Beliaghta, Belgachhia and Shyampukur, have been meeting their foot soldiers and digital teams to work out a strategy on getting the electorate to vote. “The polling percentage in south Kolkata has come as a surprise. It is very low even by the standards of Kolkata where the figure is lower than districts,” said a Trinamool candidate from north Kolkata. Candidates and their poll managers have been campaign online. WhatsApp messages and pre-recorded calls are also being sent out. “We have started posting on FB. For senior citizens, we will arrange for auto-rickshaw to ferry them to and from booths,” said the campaign manager of another candidate. Parties are focusing on high-rises and gated communities. “People from the lower-income strata depend on parties for various services and doles and so, they will come out to vote. Those living in high-rises might stay away out of virus fear. The challenge will be to mobilise them,”said another candidate. Parties have been collating details of families with senior citizens and those with co-morbidities. “We will arrange for them to be taken to booths and back,” said a ward coordinator in Burrabazar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/low-voter-turnout-amid-covid-spread-a-concern-for-parties/articleshow/82298888.cms||Zeeshan Javed

But he momentarily forgot all his troubles as his wish to don the army uniform was finally fulfilled. On Wednesday, Naitik was all smiles as he received training as an officer at EME campus in Vadodara. He was one of the beneficiaries of the Make a Wish Foundation that marks April 29 as World Wish Day. The foundation tries to fulfil wish of children with severe diseases. The Gujarat office said that about 1,600 kids were approached by the foundation during the pandemic. Dr Anil Khatri, state in-charge of the foundation, said that such small gestures often bring magical results. “It not only boosts their confidence and gives them strength to fight the disease, but also creates a long-lasting memory for the kids,” he said. Likewise, Jia Bariya, a five-year old cancer patient on Civil Hospital campus, got her favourite kitchen set and dolls. The foundation officials said that she’s too small to understand her condition, but all are trying to make her as healthy and comfortable as possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/wishes-fulfilled-boy-dons-army-fatigues-5-year-old-gets-doll-set/articleshow/82298884.cms||---

However, he sought adequate police deployment at hospitals and oxygen plants to prevent any untoward incident. “During crisis, it’s necessary to be sensitive. If patients or their family members lose their temper, we should reciprocate with patience and restraint. All officials should pick phone calls and continuously be in touch with people. The integrated command and control centres and all helplines should be made effective,” the CM said. During a review meeting on Wednesday, the CM said, ambulances and other vehicles should be made available on time. To keep pace with demand, sufficient vehicles should be made available in districts. The response time of ambulance should be brought down to minimum, the CM said. Saying that efforts were being made to provide oxygen and medicines to patients in hospitals or in home isolation, the CM added that officials must help if someone needed lifesaving drugs or oxygen. “Special care is needed for home quarantined patients and CM Helpline should maintain contact with them every day. Medicine kits should be delivered to them on time, as per protocol,” he said. Discussing ways to improve the teleconsultation services, the CM said, more phone lines were needed for this service. Phone lines would be increased in areas like Kanpur Nagar, Prayagraj, Lucknow, Varanasi, Bareilly and Agra, where there are a higher number of Covid patients. Also, doctors should advise home-quarantined patients on correct course of treatment and medicines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/be-patient-dont-blow-fuse-in-face-of-crisis-yogi-to-frontline-workers/articleshow/82301732.cms||---

Moreover, the opening date of Valley of Flowers getting deferred and Hemkund Sahib Yatra cancelled has added to the uncertainty of tour operators like Bhatt. “Even the 50-60 bookings we had for April and May have been cancelled and I had to pay back the deposits to all of them. We have a few bookings for Sattopanth trek, but it seems even those would be cancelled as Covid-19 cases across the country continue to rise,” Bhatt said. The concerns were echoed by those in the tourism industry in places like Munsyari, Uttarkashi, Kausani, Khirsu and Lansdowne. Devendra Singh, a hotelier from Munsiyari, said that of all the 50-60 hotels and homestays in the town, none have even a single booking for the next several days. “We organise treks to Nanda Devi as well as several other spots. Most of them are foreigners, but with most countries cautioning against travel to India, there are no tourists this year. We had suffered heavy losses last year too. It is becoming increasingly difficult for us to survive,” Singh said. The absence of foreigners has also dented the state’s wellness tourism industry. The yoga centres which are usually packed with tourists from abroad and outside the state are now deserted. Piyush Kumar, owner of the Almora-based Dunagiri Retreat, said that he had a six-week event planned but now it has been shelved. “Almost half of our visitors are from outside the state, from Delhi and West Bengal and because of the surge in cases, no one is willing to travel. We still have to pay Rs 1 lakh per month as upkeep costs. We have also sent our senior staff on leave without pay,” he said. Jayendra Rana, president of Uttarkashi-based Garhwal Himalaya Mountaineering and Trekking Association, said that all their bookings have been cancelled indefinitely. “The situation is worse than last year,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/homestays-hotels-wellness-retreats-on-verge-of-closure-trekking-operators-say-all-bookings-cancelled/articleshow/82297781.cms||Prashant Jha

---||Hyderabad||Why has KCR not taken vaccine: Bandi||Hyderabad: BJP state chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar on Wednesday sought to know why chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and TRS leaders have not taken Covid-19 vaccine. Addressing a press conference, he said, “Vaccination plays a major role in controlling Covid- 19 spread and TRS regime is not sincere about it. First, the CM and other leaders should tell if they got vaccine dose or not.” Sanjay alleged that TRS ministers were trying to sling mud on the Union government when the vaccine was being given by the Centre. “Oxygen was sent by tankers from Centre, but state is showing off,” he said. Alleging that the chief minister was responsible for the virus spread in the state, he said, “As KCR said the intensity of Covid-19 is less in the state, people have taken it easy, leading to the second wave. Though BJP did not want municipal polls, TRS went ahead.” He also said all Covid-19 cases could be attributed to negligence of the government. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi is trying to sensitise the nation on the pandemic and support the state, but the TRS government is not bothered about it. Chief minister KCR has not conducted a single review on the issue,” he added. He also said that data of the state government on Covid-19 deaths and cases might not be correct.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/why-has-kcr-not-taken-vaccine-bandi/articleshow/82299872.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Mumbai||Proposed to raise fine for spitting to Rs 1,200, BMC to Bombay high court||MUMBAI: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has informed Bombay high court that it has on April 16 placed a proposal to amend bye-laws of 2006 to raise fines from Rs 200 to Rs 1200 for those found spitting on public streets.  The proposal placed before municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal comes over a week after the HC had, while hearing a PIL to tackle the spitting menace, said, “It defies logic” how BMC has been collecting Rs 200 as fine when the act mandates Rs 1,200. The BMC, in its reply to the PIL filed by advocate Armin Wandrewala, said it has taken additional steps to spread awareness about the order passed on April 7 by the HC to sensitize the public to dangers and legal consequences too of spitting including fine and ‘community service for an hour like sweeping road or graffiti-cleaning as directed by the nuisance detector.’ It also painted a “side wall’’ in Bandra with a ‘do not spit’ public message and is using a ‘mobile van’ and placing banners, posters and hoardings too. “But finally it is the citizen who has to take proper care to avoid Covid and to maintain Covid-appropriate behavior...” said the affidavit filed by a deputy chief engineer of the BMC  Wandrewala had made several suggestions to curb spitting to prevent spread of Covid-19. The HC in its order had directed the authorities to “implement some of the suggestions of the petitioner as would appear to them to be acceptable and can be translated into action”. The state affidavit filed by deputy commissioner of police (operations) said the suggestion to make offenders do community services is “not reasonable, workable or practical as there are no legal provisions authorising the police to make any person do community service”. However, if the high court passes an order, the police said it is “ready and willing to abide” by it. Fine collected till April 20 by BMC: Rs 46 crore from ‘face mask cases’ and Rs 25 lakh from spitting cases Fine by Mumbai police: Rs 5.7 crore from spitting cases Fine by clean up marshal agencies from ‘errant’ maskless travellers of the suburban railway and found spitting: Rs 50 lakh. State says:14,655 cases registered between January 1, 2020, and April 19, 2021, under sections 115 to 117 of Maharashtra Police Act which provides for Rs 1200 fine to people creating ‘nuisance on the public street’ by spitting. 18,000 cases in the same period under section 269 and 290 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which provides for six months and/or fine for ‘negligently spreading infection of any disease dangerous to life and fine of Rs 200 for public nuisance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/proposed-to-raise-fine-for-spitting-to-rs-1200-bmc-to-bombay-hc/articleshow/82299898.cms||Swati Deshpande

Police said function halls were out of bounds as guests cannot stay there and added that in Hyderabad the venue of these marriages are star hotels and high-end resorts. Telangana government has imposed a cap of 50 attendees to any marriage being held during the non-curfew hours at all function halls, to contain the spread of the virus and a complete ban after 9 pm in these venues. A top officer from Hyderabad police commissionerate described it as a ‘tricky issue’, but added that even inside hotels Covid appropriate behaviour will apply. “So, allowing marriages which violate Covid norms inside hotels is an offence,” he said. Cyberabad police said they are not keeen on granting permission. “Given the prevailing coronavirus situation, we will not be keen to grant such permission,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cops-marriages-cant-be-held-in-function-halls-during-curfew/articleshow/82299900.cms||---
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Fallen coronavirus heroes get immortalized in govt buildings||RAJKOT: They say fallen heroes represent the character of a nation with a long history of patriotism and honour. Indeed, this can be best ascribed to Gujarat’s frontline corona warriors, who, imbibed with the spirit of service, laid down their lives while helping the needy. And, what can be best an honour to them, but to immortalize the names of these unknown, unsung heroes, etched in concrete, quite literally? In a unique tribute to rural health workers who sacrificed their lives fighting the pandemic, the Bhavnagar district administration on Tuesday decided to re-name three government buildings — two primary health centres (PHCs) and one government school — in the names of the workers in their native villages. The decision was implemented on Wednesday by rechristening these buildings. District development officer (DDO) V J Baranwal said, “As a token of honour for our deceased workers and also to boost sagging morale of health workers, we have decided to honour our three corona warriors who gave up their lives battling the virus during the past one-and-a-half years.” The administration changed Bhavnagar taluka’s Bhumbali primary health centre’s (PHC) name to Ritaben Gohel Prathmik Arogya Kendra. Gohel, 52, was a female health worker in this PHC and died serving patients here on April 20 this year. The second building to get a new name in Talaja taluka was of Trapaj PHC which was renamed as Kalpnaben Joshi Prathmik Arogya Kendra. Joshi, 58, was a health supervisor here who was to retire on April 30, but succumbed to the virus 10 days before she hung her boots. Finally, the name of Mithivirdi primary school in Talaja taluka was changed to Ajay Dabhi Prathmik Shala to honour a lab technician at Sir T hospital Bhavnagar who was native of Mithivirdi and was working on contractual basis at the hospital. The administration will put up boards soon with the new names of these public buildings. Rural health workers are the first contact persons who identify Covid suspects and provide primary treatment. They are then referred to bigger hospitals if required. Community health centres and PHCs have 187 beds to treat Covid patients with mild and moderate symptoms. Besides, the health workers are also responsible for regular visits to homes of isolated persons and pregnant women. Bhavnagar district has nearly 1,300 health workers and nearly 1500 Aasha workers on Covid duty at present. “The taluka development officer and other senior officers including myself have now decided to also visit health workers and their family members as a gesture of appreciation for their immense contribution towards society,” Baranwal added. District panchayats normally bear the cost of treatment of infected health workers and their family members including medicine but from now will now pay some cash also to workers with salaries below Rs 20,000 per month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/fallen-coronavirus-heroes-get-immortalized-in-govt-buildings/articleshow/82297837.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

According to the figures issued by the state government, UP recorded 1.11 lakh MT of wheat procurement per day this year, which was much more than daily procurement of 72,000 MT in 2020-21. A state government spokesperson said the procurement of wheat has touched 9.66 MT (till April 27) which was more than double the last year’s 4.07 MT during the same period. The procurement of wheat is being done through 6,000 purchase centres on the minimum support price of Rs 1,975 per quintal. Food and civil supplies commissioner, Manish Chauhan, said, “The procurement process has picked up pace and total purchase of nearly Rs 1,909 crore has been made so far. The payment is being directly credited to the farmers’ bank accounts in a hassle-free manner.” Chauhan said 1.86 lakh farmers have already been benefited from the procurement exercise. “To ensure that farmers do not face any problem, the government has nominated seven purchasing agencies, including the department of food and civil supplies, Pradeshik Cooperative Federation (PCF), Mandi Parishad and Food Corporation of India,” he added. He said the department had taken all precautions in view of the pandemic. To prevent farmers from getting infected, a Covid help desk has been set up at every centre. “No one is being allowed at centres without a mask. Farmers not wearing masks are being provided one by the Covid helpdesk and social distancing is being followed,” he said. The centres are also providing facilities like handwash, water, sanitizer, thermometer and oximeter to keep a check on the spread of coronavirus. The state government has initiated geo-tagging of all storage godowns and purchase centres for the benefit of farmers. At the same time, online tokens have been arranged by the government for the convenience of farmers to prevent Covid spread.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/despite-corona-spike-average-wheat-procurement-up-by-54/articleshow/82299894.cms||---

The district registered 7,503 positive cases of which 4,803 are from the city, 2,690 from rural and 10 from other districts. Cumulative cases surged to 3,93,830 and are likely to cross 4 lakh in the next couple of days. Between April 21 and 25, the district set new record cases every day. The total number of cases were 37,828 and the daily average 7,566. The cases declined to 5,852 and 6,287 on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, for a total of 12,139 cases and daily average of 6,069. A 26,525 samples were tested on Wednesday. Fewer people were tested on Monday and Tuesday. The district recorded 41,905 tests in these two days for a daily average of 20,952. On Saturday and Sunday, tests were 50,001 for a daily average of 25,000. Between April 22 and 28, the highest-ever 50,241 cases have been registered (daily average 7,177) and 636 deaths (91). The test positivity rate (TPR) was also a record high of 31.06%. Tests reduced to some extent to 1,61,732 (23,105). Case fatality rate (CFR) was 1.27% and low compared with August to October last year due to high number of cases in the second wave. The 85 deaths on Wednesday took the toll to 7,211. RT-PCR tests are likely to increase from Thursday as the NMC will be sending samples to the mobile lab of SpiceHealth which is stationed at Suresh Bhat auditorium. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said that 500 tests will be conducted initially. “It will increase to 2,000 in phases and finally to 12,000 per day,” he said. Results will be available in 24 hours although Union minister Nitin Gadkari, who pushed the project, had said it would be within four hours. The state government will bear cost of Rs 283 per test. Meanwhile, former mayor Sandip Joshi alleged that some private hospitals are asking for huge advance amount, issuing exorbitant bills and “openly saying that they have managed auditors appointed by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC)”. In a press release on Wednesday, Joshi warned that action would be taken against such private hospitals and auditors. “Majority of hospitals are doing good work amid district facing worst-ever situation. At the same time, few private hospitals are demanding an advance of Rs 2-5 lakh when patients reaching the hospitals. Health minister Rajesh Tope had announced hospitals will not take any advance and stringent action will be taken in case such thing happens in the state. Despite capping of rates for 80% beds, some private hospitals are charging exorbitantly. Bills worth Rs 3.50 lakh are issued for 3-day admissions. I spoke to a private hospital where a doctor confirmed that the auditors are ‘managed’. It is a serious issue. I will be able at the office of ruling party leader from 4 to 6pm daily where people can filed excess bill complaints. It will be resolved within 48 hours. Details can be had on 9822204677, 9561098052, 7744018785 and 7447786105,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-2-day-dip-covid-cases-back-to-7-5k/articleshow/82298901.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Reviewing the procurement progress at a virtual meeting with his cabinet, Amarinder ordered strict adherence to Covid protocols amid the current surge. He urged all farmers, arhtiyas, labourers, employees of procurement agencies and other stakeholders visiting grain markets to get themselves vaccinated at Covid vaccination camps in all 154 market committees across the state. Regarding availability of gunny bags, principal secretary of food, civil supplies K A P Sinha informed the chief minister that the issue had been sorted out and there was no shortage. Some instances of shortage were reported earlier from some mandis as the Centre had allocated fewer bales in contrast to the requirement of the state agencies and early arrivals had pushed up demand, he said. The chief minister expressed satisfaction at the smooth procurement amid challenges faced by the state due to the ongoing farmers agitation against the farm laws passed by the Centre, the initial hostility of arhtiyas towards DBT, shortage of labour and bales as well as heavy and quick early arrivals along with the surge in Covid cases in the state. Wheat procurement commenced in Punjab on April 10. In a span of just 18 days, 98 LMT wheat has arrived in mandis, of which 95.97 LMT has already been procured. Further, 70% of the stock due to be lifted in 72 hours has been lifted from mandis, while 90% of the due payment of MSP — Rs 14,958 crore — has been cleared by the department directly into the bank accounts of nearly 5 lakh farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-shortage-of-gunny-bags-5l-farmers-paid-rs-14958cr/articleshow/82298896.cms||---

According to additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad, as many as 1.86 lakh tests were conducted in the past 24 hours and of those tested, 29,824 people were found positive. He said that the number of recoveries in the same duration was 35,903 and after a gap of over four weeks, the recoveries have outnumbered the new cases.

As on date the number of recovered reached 8,70,864. Expressing happiness over the rise in the number of recoveries, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that it is very important to sustain the on-going efforts with patience and stand strong against the pandemic virus. “The participation of every single person is vital to the containment strategy and each one must do their bit by wearing masks, following hand hygiene and maintaining social distance,” he said.

They say that it is essential for them to get vaccinated before being sent on Covid-19 duties. Some district administrations have already urged the respective chief education officers to look into the possibility of vaccinating teachers against Covid-19 on priority. This demand comes in the wake of the state government mulling to involve government teachers in monitoring those who have been put under home isolation. “The vaccination of teachers is necessary. Also, PPE kits should be provided to the teachers who will be sent on Covid-19 duty. The prevailing situation is quite scary and one can never be too safe in such conditions,” said a member of the state teachers association. Meanwhile, state education minister Arvind Pandey has said that the government will fulfill this demand soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/vaccinate-teachers-before-sending-them-on-covid-duty/articleshow/82297829.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Ahmedabad||Now, rickshaw ambulances to help ferry Covid patients in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: A non-governmental organisation has come to the aid of corona patients by roping in 10 auto rickshaws to act as ambulances and shift patients to hospitals. Bhavika Bhogekar of Panah Foundation said that it is working largely for the benefit of the poor and helping them to get various benefits announced by the government. “We earlier used to help migrants get their documentation in order so that they can avail of government benefits,” she said Bhogekar said that during a meeting, they realized that 108 drivers were doing their best to admit patients, but with such a high number of calls, it was not possible for them to reach out to everyone. This also resulted in a rise in wait time. “We decided that we would start an auto rickshaw ambulance only for patients who need hospitalisation or need to go to laboratory for test or High-Resolution CT scan.” “Usually, rickshaw drivers do not ferry Covid-positive patients. So, the auto ambulance will be very handy,” she said, adding: “The driver would be in PPE kit and help ferry the patient to any hospital that s/he wants to go to.” However, this service will not be available for critical patients. “If any patient has oxygen cylinders and wants us to shift him/her to a hospital, we will lend assistance. As soon as we receive a call, we ask about the condition of patients first.” The foundation, which has five branches in the city, says the aim is to provide a vehicle to shift patient within 20 minutes of the call. The foundation will pay these drivers and if they received from funds from donors they will rope in more rickshaws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/now-rickshaw-ambulances-to-help-ferry-covid-patients/articleshow/82298943.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

The department of social justice, empowerment, and minorities implemented the scheme. Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh clarified that the scheme applied is also for Muslim girls above 18, along with the Scheduled Caste, Christians, Backward Classes and Castes, economically weaker section, and daughters of the widows of any caste. Scheduled Caste widows and divorcees are also entitled at the time of re-marriage. The hike will benefit 60,000 people and cost the state Rs 180 crore.

British Association of Physician of Indian Origin (BAPIO) has extended members who will conduct tele consultation with Covid afflicted patients registered or admitted under Kingsway Hospital (260 beds), and their Covid care center at Hotel Center Point (180 beds). Dr Rajkumar Khandelwal, Managing Director, Kingsway Institute of Health Sciences informed that the doctors from UK have also offered their expertise from various fields to interact with the treating consultants. “The doctors will be taking virtual rounds of admitted patients along with RMOs and also periodical tele-consultation to home isolation patients. This will also reduce burden on treating team of physicians,” he said. Prof Parag Singal, Consultant Endocrinologist and National secretary BAPIO is heading this initiative with support of Dr Ramesh Mehta, President BAPIO. Dr Mehta, who hails from Vidarbha, said that doctors in UK are eager to see patients in Nagpur as the city has witnessed sudden surge in the number of cases probably due to the Indian variant of the virus. Some uncommon symptoms, sudden lung deterioration in youngsters and rise in deaths are the issues the doctors willing to focus on. “We are also planning more help in form of equipments to bring some relief to the suffering patients,” he added. Doctors of Indian origin from UK selected Kingsway hospital for this association because BAPIO is having old association with the hospital. BAPIO’s training academy (BTA) runs courses in Emergency Medicine along with the Royal College of Edinburgh. Kingsway Hospital is the only center in Central India running these courses since 2020. Two batches of students have joined these courses since then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/uk-docs-to-see-nagpur-covid-19-patients-online/articleshow/82298960.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Covid claims third BJP MLA in a week||LUCKNOW: BJP’s Nawabganj (Bareilly) MLA Kesar Singh Gangwar, 64, died of Covid at a super-speciality hospital in Noida on Wednesday, making him the third BJP MLA from Uttar Pradesh to succumb to the virus within a week. Lucknow (West) legislator Suresh Srivastava and Auraiyya MLA Ramesh Chandra Diwakar died last Friday amidst the pandemic’s second lethal run. CM Yogi Adityanath, state BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya expressed grief, saying Kesar Singh’s death was a big jolt to the party. In the first pandemic wave last year, two UP ministers, Chetan Chauhan and Kamal Rani Varun — MLAs from Naugawan Sadat and Ghatampur respectively — died of Covid complications. After testing positive on April 18, Kesar Singh was taken to Ram Murti Medical College, Bareilly, where his condition worsened. His son, Vishal, even took to social media to express his angst over the quality of treatment. Later, the state government shifted him to a private super-speciality hospital in Noida, where he passed away on Wednesday. The MLA is survived by his wife, two daughters and a son. Two years ago, his elder son Munindra passed away. Singh was with BSP before being expelled by party chief Mayawati in 2016 on charges of anti-party activity. He later joined BJP and won from Nawabganj seat in the 2017 assembly elections. Kesar’s sister-in-law Usha Gangwar has been a chairperson of Bareilly zila panchayat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-claims-third-bjp-mla-in-a-week/articleshow/82299955.cms||Pankaj Shah

With work drying up, the sex workers don’t have earnings. The 19-year-old student has, however, managed to collect enough funds to help a section of the sex workers. When the city was put under a lockdown on April 19, with no prospects of any income, many of the GB Road workers went back to their villages. Those who stayed back rely on their savings and food stocks to feed themselves and their children. One sex worker said, “Police have forced us to keep the doors to our rooms shut because they said an open door could attract customers. With everything closing down, I have had to take loans to feed my child and myself. I have been unwell too but there’s no help.” Another sex worker rued that they couldn’t afford “good masks or hand sanitisers”. “Without assistance from the government, we are without soaps or detergent, or even cooking gas,” she said. Nakul and his friend, both children of sex workers, thought of how they could be of help. “We decided to approach an NGO, which suggested that we collect and distribute food items like rice, dal, oil, turmeric powder, coriander powder and red chilli powder as well as sugar and flour — all the basic items required in any household,” said Nakul. The teenager, who recently passed his Class XII from the National Institute of Open Schooling, said the cops were reluctant to allow distribution of the items initially, but later realised that the two youngsters only wanted to help the community. The plan is to distribute ration packets to the nearly 800 sex workers still at GB Road. “Currently, we have ration kits for 200 people. We will distribute these and add more to the project,” said Nakul. As locals, the two lads think it will prove easy to reach out and connect with the sex workers. “We will wear PPE suits and go to each of the hundreds of rooms to hand over the rations kits. That will be safer than calling people to our room,” said the youth, who will seek admission now in Delhi University. “We have the support of a number of civil societies and NGOs like Light Up.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sex-workers-kids-do-their-bit-to-ward-off-hunger/articleshow/82317691.cms||Mohammad Ibrar
---||Kolkata||Popular TMC contender takes dissent in stride, BJP banks on devpt promise||Kolkata: Unlike some constituencies in and around Kolkata, Cossipore-Belgachhia will witness a fight between a popular Trinamool leader in north Kolkata and a BJP candidate was till recently associated with the incumbent party. Development is the key poll issue across six wards of Cossipore-Belgachia assembly seat. While BJP candidate Shibaji Singha Roy is betting big on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Sonar Bangla” agenda, Trinamool’s Atin Ghosh, a former deputy mayor, promises to carry forward the development work rolled out by his party. Ghosh said the Trinamool-run KMC had upgraded the civic infrastructure and he would continue with the work with assistance from the state. Ghosh has been on tours of his constituency to listen to peoples’ grievances, which he alleged, were “fanned” by the BJP candidate. Singha Roy has been raising issues about water crisis, coupled with a poor drainage network flooding large areas of Cossipore, Belgachia, parts of Dum Dum and Raja Manindra Road, every monsoon. Ghosh is a popular face in north Kolkata, an advantage he has over his BJP contender. But some leaders, considered close to him, conceded a major challenge for him would be to bring two warring Trinamool groups in the Cossipore-Belgachia belt to the election platform to brighten his poll prospect. “At least two Trinamool councillors do not agree with four party councillors, known as Ghosh loyalists. This has made Ghosh jittery,” said a leader. Singha Roy seems confident of his victory. “Let’s talk about development. I have planned to make my constituency a major tourist destination. We will take help of the Centre’s Namami Gange project and beautify the riverfront. We will launch water taxis,” he said. But Ghosh told TOI that he would like to remind BJP about KMC’s initiative to beautify Cossipore riverfront and upgrade Ratanbabur ghat. Politicians should also focus on the living condition at slums, said Subir Dutta, a retired government official from Belgachhia. “They should improve the basic health and hygiene condition at the Belgachhia slum,” Dutta said. Nasima Bibi from a Cossipore slum hoped the new MLA would be available in times of need. “We are waiting for the day when the elections are over and still, our MLA visits us,” she said. Pratip Dasgupta, the Sanjukta Morcha candidate, has been visiting door to door, including slums, promised to reach out to people when they needed him, whether he won or lost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/popular-tmc-contender-takes-dissent-in-stride-bjp-banks-on-devpt-promise/articleshow/82298966.cms||Saikat Ray

The premium Indian brand sells 90% of its sourced tea abroad, especially the US. Bala Sarda, founder & CEO, VAHDAM India, told TOI: “Our first flush collection was launched with early invoices from 15 legendary tea estates of Goodricke Group. If most of the Indian five-star hotels can offer Darjeeling tea bags packaged by foreign companies such as Dilmah or Twinings, why can’t we? Proper international packaging and logistics can take us to that position.” VAHDAM India, which was awarded the Global SMB by Jeff Bezos during his visit to India, launched its products in India last year and has witnessed an early growth with the help of a strong brand positioning in key markets. It ships tea to 1.5 million customers in over 100 countries. Elaborating on the deal, Goodricke MD and CEO Atul Asthana said: “Vahdam plans to source teas directly from producers and they have entered into a strategic procurement partnership with Goodricke. This will enable us to use their global distribution network,” However, the tea will not be sold via joint branding. “They will tell stories about the teas they are packing. If they are selling a Margaret’s Hope tea, they will explain and give details about the garden etc. They will sell the tea as a single estate product such as MH or Castleton,” added Asthana. Vahdam’s First Flush Collection is air-lifted to its BRC Global Standard-certified modern facility in the NCR (National Capital Region), where it is packed and shipped instantly. The company has also set up a new state-of-the-art 1,00,000 sq ft factory at NCR. The company has posted a delivered net revenue of Rs 159 crore in FY21, up from Rs 75 crore in FY20, registering a 110% YoY growth. The brand also garnered net profit in FY21. “We plan to continue to grow by focussing on three key growth triggers such as going deeper into its current markets (the US, Canada, the UK & Germany) and growing its omni-channel distribution, strengthening presence in new markets like India and diversifying into other product categories.” The brand which was featured on Oprah Winfrey's List of Favorite Things and Ellen Degeneres Show in the US also has a strong social purpose and is certified climate and plastic neutral.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/vahdam-to-source-darj-tea-from-goodricke-eyes-rs-500-cr-revenue-in-3-years/articleshow/82298968.cms||Sovon Manna
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: On-&-off Co-Win response hits Phase III vax booking||KOLKATA: Many vaccine enthusiasts in the 18-44 years age bracket, who had been waiting for the turn to get the jab, logged into the Co-Win software as soon as it opened for registration on Wednesday evening. While some could register themselves, many found the app inaccessible and were left frustrated. Those who could register have been unable to book an appointment. Ajay Mittal, an NGO worker who lives in Hazra, tried to log into the portal in the morning only to realise that Phase III version of the portal would be operational only after 4 pm. “At 4pm sharp, I logged into the website and got the OTP on my cellphone. The registration was smooth but when I tried to book an appointment, the page said no vaccination centre was available,” said Mittal. Even as the third phase inoculation is expected to be rolled out on May 1 across the country, in Bengal the drive will start only on May 5. Unlike the other two phases where the drive could be carried out offline partially, the government has made online registration mandatory this time. Vedansh Patel of Bhowanipore had donated blood a few days ago and was keenly waiting to register for the vaccine shot as soon as the third phase drive is launched. But he was unable to register. “The website crashed and several of my friends who tried to log in for the registration could not access the portal. My parents are vaccinated. My sister and I need to get the shots,” said Patel.  These technical glitches were intermittent as Swati Chakraborty, a Southern Avenue resident, discovered. She could log in a little after 8pm and registered herself. But she too was unable to book an appointment. Glitches had been reported when the vaccination portal was launched for the first time. The phase I vaccination had to be carried out offline for several days. During the second phase rollout, too, many faced problems in booking slots initially while some were allotted slots in vaccination centres located far away from home. “I hope these technical issues get sorted out soon so that I can book my appointment. Another worry is availability of vaccine. Otherwise, there is no point in registering for the drive.

Now, we have appointed nodal officers who will ensure that we get the injection on basis of the requirement in the state,” said the CM. On being asked about the spiralling Covid-19 infections in Dehradun, the CM said that the cases are rising as people have come to the state capital from adjoining states of Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana. “We will help everyone and efforts are ongoing to bring down the number of Covid-19 cases,” he added. In reply to a question on preparations for the second wave, he said, “We are adding 50 oxygen beds in the Government Dehradun Medical College and 30 more in Coronation Hospital. We are arranging for more beds and oxygen in other districts as well.” The CM further said that 1,000 beds have been arranged in Dehradun sports college and 150 in Haldwani sports college. The CM also denied any shortage of medical oxygen in Uttarakhand. “There is no shortage of medical oxygen in Uttarakhand. We are even supplying oxygen to some states. Cylinders are a concern but we are trying to find a solution at the earliest,” he added. Meanwhile, the CM also pointed out that the state cabinet has approved Rs 450 crore for the vaccination of around 50 lakh people falling in the age bracket of 18-to-45 years. “I have directed the authorities to take strict action against those who are found flouting curfew norms. We have further strengthened checking at the state border,” said Rawat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/2500-more-remdesivir-injections-to-reach-ukhand-soon-cm/articleshow/82297873.cms||Kautilya Singh

On Sunday, at a similar camp at Urbana complex, 350 residents had received their first jab. However, most of the other housing complexes complained that private hospitals and clinics that had earlier given them camp dates are now either deferring or cancelling them claiming shortage of vaccine stocks. “We were hopeful about the May 2 camp but Apollo Hospitals, our partner, has said that it is not in a position to confirm the date right now. Our facility is ready and inspection is over,” said Manav Mehera, president of Siddha Pines. Similar cancellations have happened at Uniworld, City Centre Residency, Astitva Complex, Swarnamani and many more complexes. “We arranged the entire set up only to be told that the camp will not happen. Residents are frustrated,” said Asim Dutta, secretary of Lakeview Complex in Dumurjala. Kunal Khilani, who runs three Apollo Clinics in the city, said: “I was forced to call the camps off because there is sheer shortage of supply. I don’t have enough to run my own clinics. How can I hold vaccine camps in complexes?” said a frustrated Khilani. South City complex is leaving no stone unturned and has applied for camps with three private hospitals but no date has yet been given.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vaccination-hopes-dashed-at-gated-complexes/articleshow/82297856.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Kolkata||Recipients toil hard to get jab amid acute vial crisis in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Amidst the acute shortage of vaccine shots, rush for the jabs and the uncertainty looming over vaccine supply to private Covid vaccination centres (CVCs), the state government has assured private hospitals of helping them with the second dose that they have committed to recipients. The government has also said that it will work out on an agreed methodology with private hospitals for people coming in for the first dose. Meanwhile, people continue to throng CVCs but with the supply of doses being rationed, many had to return without the jab while the rest had to wait for hours to get their turn. Even as most CVCs struggled to meet the rising demand with the curtailed supply, many sites especially under Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) remained close for non-availability of vaccines. Among the worst affected by the shortage are centres under BMC. Only three CVCs are conducting the drive. The rest have shut down due to non-availability of doses. “Since we are giving priority to the second dose, we sent off people who had come for the first dose as our stock ran out,” said a coordinator at a state-run facility. “From about 170 to 180 vials earlier, we are now receiving only about 35 vials for vaccination. On Tuesday, all the centres except Matri Sadan had to be kept closed,” said an official. Due to the curtailed supply, the backlog — especially those whose second doses are due — has piled up. “In addition to around 8,000 people lined up for the second dose at our hospitals, the number of people coming in for the first dose has surged. The demand and supply mismatch has rendered us unable to give the shot to everybody who turns up at our centre,” said Nibedita Chatterjee, CEO of ILS Dum Dum. Government officials have told private hospitals to mediate and monitor their effort to procure vaccine from the manufacturers for the drive from May 1 onwards. “We have taken appointments till May 30 and no further. We will start taking in vaccination appointment only after we get a clarity of the supply from May 1 onwards,” said Sudipta Mitra, CEO of Peerless Hospitals. On Wednesday, the state got another consignment of 4 lakh doses of Covishield. But sources at the state’s vaccine store said they will start despatching it to districts only after getting the count for each district from the health department officials. “The fresh consignment will help tide over the crisis only partially. The shortage continues. These doses would last only a single day if we pressed all our CVCs into service,” said a health department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/recipients-toil-hard-to-get-jab-amid-acute-vial-crisis/articleshow/82297868.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Lucknow||Rural polls final round: Tough fight at BSP fort||Lucknow: The fourth and final phase of UP panchayat elections on Thursday will witness a pitched electoral battle in 17 districts, including BSP stronghold of Ambedkarnagar and jailed gangster Mukhtar Ansari’s pocket borough of Mau. The districts, which will go to polls include Aligarh, Kushinagar, Kaushambi, Ghazipur, Farrukhabad, Bulandshahr, Basti, Bahraich, Banda, Mathura, Shahjahanpur, Sambhal, Sitapur, Sonbhadra and Hapur. A keen contest is likely to be seen in Ambedkarnagar, where BJP seeks to make deeper inroads ahead of UP assembly elections. At least 10,754 candidates will be in fray for 738 zila panchayat wards, 86,049 candidates for 18,356 kshetra panchayat wards and 1,13,092 candidates for post of chairpersons in 14,111 gram panchayats, as per state election commission data.A keen contest is likely to be seen in Ambedkarnagar, where BJP seeks to make deeper inroads ahead of UP assembly elections. The district, which was carved out of Faizabad by BSP chief Mayawati in 1995, comprises 41 zila panchayat, 1,020 kshetra panchayats and 902 gram panchayats. In fact, Mayawati has represented Akbarpur seat (now in Ambedkarnagar) thrice – in 1998, 1999 and 2004 Lok Sabha elections. The seat was represented by BSP’s Rakesh Pandey in 2009. But in 2014, it was snatched by BJP’s Hari Om Pandey. In 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BSP’s Ritesh Pandey wrested the seat back from BJP. So is the case with Mau and Ghazipur, where don-turned-neta Mukhtar Ansari and his brother Afzal Ansari hold sway. While Mukhtar happens to be BSP MLA from Mau, Afzal represents BSP from Ghazipur in Lok Sabha. Mau is an assembly segment of Ghosi parliamentary seat, which was won by BSP’s Atul Kumar Singh in 2019. Mau has 34 zila panchayat wards, while Ghazipur comprises 67. Sitapur also happens to be crucial for political parties given its size – it has the maximum number of 79 zila panchayat wards, 1978 kshetra panchayat wards and 1596 gram panchayats. The Sitapur parliamentary seat, which has a sizable population of OBCs and Dalits, is currently represented by BJP’s Rajesh Verma who is party’s state unit chief of OBC Morcha. Stakes are high for BJP in Mathura, which is represented by actor-turned politician Hema Malini in Lok Sabha and party MLA and cabinet minister Srikant Sharma. The district comprises 33 zila panchayat wards, 813 kshetra panchayat wards and 504 gram panchayats. The same holds true for Shahjahanpur, which is represented by senior BJP leader and parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Khanna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rural-polls-final-round-tough-fight-at-bsp-fort/articleshow/82299983.cms||Pankaj Shah

However, the woman did not want to marry him for some reason,” said assistant inspector AK Dabhade of the Wakad police station. The officer said that ever since the suspect and his family members harassed the woman and persuaded her to get married. “The suspect was threatening her over the phone and he had even written posts defaming her on social media platforms,” Dabhade said. The woman’s brother, who lodged an FIR against the suspects stated that his sister was under stress for the past six months due to the harassment. “On Monday, around 7am, when the brother had gone out, she hanged herself,” Dabhade said. The police found that the woman had left six different notes on her cellphone. “She has named all six suspects in the notes.

The directives came after AIIMS director brought to HC’s notice about shortage faced by them to manage their increased bed capacity. She informed that all 220 beds can’t be used for want of sufficient oxygen supply and an inadequate number of doctors. She made a request for immediately sending on deputation about eight to ten MBBS doctors, and if not possible, at least Ayush, BAMS and Homeopathy experts, who could be sufficiently trained by the AIIMS team. A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote asked the NMC commissioner and collector to select doctors having Ayush, BAMS and Homeopathy qualifications by issuing necessary orders and depute them at AIIMS. “We also direct both to consider sending on deputation some MBBS doctors from GMCH or fresh medical graduates to AIIMS, before the next hearing. We find that the doctors’ need can be fulfilled if the DMER considers allocating bond services of MBBS graduates in pursuance of its April 16 notice in sufficient numbers to AIIMS. We direct the DMER to allocate bond service for such medicos in an adequate number ranging from 25 to 40 doctors.” Earlier, IMA counsel Bhanudas Kulkarni informed that Air Force Maintenance Command was having its hospital in the city that wasn’t declared as Covid hospital. Therefore, some of its doctors and nursing staff could be requisitioned for serving at various hospitals, including AIIMS. “We direct NMC chief and collector to make a request in this regard to the Maintenance Command commanding officer and inform the court accordingly. The IMA members must also consider the clarion call for their services by AIIMS. We would request all its members to volunteer their services as specialists there,” the bench said, before asking IMA to submit a list of doctors before next hearing on Thursday. On increasing the oxygen cylinders supply to AIIMS, the judges said an appropriate decision can be taken in a day or two. “Till that time, we would request the collector to increase oxygen cylinders supply by issuing an order.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-asks-govt-ima-dmer-to-provide-docs-to-aiims-for-covid-patients/articleshow/82298977.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Posta and some other markets that deal with food items would be functional. The decision was taken on Wednesday by the Confederation of West Bengal Trade Associations (CWBTA). The association believes that it would help break the corona chain. CWBTA president Sushil Poddar said: “We appeal to all our constituent associations to keep their markets, shops and establishment closed from Thursday till Sunday to break the chain of coronavirus. Please bear it in mind that Thursday is an election day and hence will have to be closed. The markets are scheduled to remain closed Saturday and Sunday as per a previous circular. So we just need to keep our shops closed for Friday to maintain the continuity and break the chain.” CWBTA general secretary Rajesh Bhatia pointed out that for the safety of all traders, their staff, customers and the general public, some advisory is being issued to curtail and contain the pandemic. This includes operating all markets/shops/offices from 10am to 5pm and remain closed on Saturdays and Sundays. “Try to encourage work from home culture once again. Wearing of mask is compulsory for all staffers and customers. Offer free mask to customers not wearing one,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/non-essential-item-markets-to-stay-shut-for-four-days/articleshow/82297875.cms||---

Told to pay fine, maskless man sets pet on cop||KALYAN: A shop owner has been arrested for allegedly setting his two dogs at a policeman who demanded that he and his two employees pay up a fine for not wearing masks. One of the dogs ended up biting a policeman. On Tuesday afternoon, a special squad comprising four police personnel and four employees of Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation found the shopkeeper Satyanarayan Gupta (43) and his attendants Anand Gupta (27) and Aditya Gupta (25) had kept their shop in Dombivli open beyond the permitted timing, said senior inspector Sachin Sanbhor of Dombivli police station. “Also, all three of them were sitting without wearing masks outside the shop in Khambalpada locality,” said Sanbhor. The special team has taken photos of the maskless men, said an officer. When members of the special team asked them to pay a total penalty of Rs 1,500 as all three had no masks, an argument broke out. The shopkeeper refused to pay the fine, said the police. As the argument continued, Satyanarayan unleashed his two pet dogs at the special squad members. “One of the pet dogs bit a policeman,” said Sanbhor. The dogs were around the place at the time, and were barking due to the commotion. While Satyanarayan and Anand have been arrested, the police are on the lookout for Aditya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-act-of-dog-told-to-pay-fine-maskless-man-sets-pet-on-cop/articleshow/82300012.cms||Pradeep Gupta

Those who escaped have been identified as Sher Singh of Lopoke in Amritsar, Inderjit Singh Dhiana of Kapurthala and Jasvir Singh of Kiratpur Sahib in Ropar. The trio escaped on Tuesday night after making a hole in the wall of the prison cell. The jail officials came to know about the incident Wednesday morning. Sher Singh was deported from the United Kingdom and was undergoing a 22-year sentence. He was brought to the Patiala jail from Bathinda jail earlier this month. IG Jail Roop Kumar said search operation was carried out inside Patiala jail, however, the accused jail inmates could not be traced as they managed to scale the boundary wall. He said Sher Singh was deported under a bilateral treaty and was undergoing jail term in India. He said Sher Singh was imprisoned for 22 years in the UK in a murder case. “Sher Singh was lodged in Bathinda jail and was recently shifted to Patiala Central Jail. He along with the other two escapees managed to make a hole in the washroom of the cell and then escaped by scaling the boundary wall. It is not an easy task to scale the wall and it seems that some planning was made, and help was arranged from outside. Prima facie no connivance of officials is observed but a case is registered and the probe is underway,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/3-prisoners-escape-from-patiala-jail/articleshow/82298989.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||No vaccine from May 1 irks 18+, many unable to register on Co-Win app||NAGPUR: Utter confusion and disappointment prevailed among 18+ people eager for Covid-19 vaccination. A majority kept on trying through the day but could not register on Co-Win website. Later, the government upset their plans further by deciding not to start inoculation of 18+ from May 1. Activist Shashank Gattewar told TOI, “Many people were waiting for 4pm and thronged the website to register. Only one in 10 persons could register. Most were unable to login after entering the contact number. Karandeep Renu was lucky to register but could not proceed further to select centre and schedule vaccination.” Gattewar added, “I received complaints from many about glitches in Co-Win website. Aatish Lahane managed to open the website and enter contact number, but did not receive OTP for login. Deep Kotecha and Aditya Nagrajan said website was crashing and home page was not opening. This sent a bad message among the youth. I have been witnessing websites of government, whether it be Co-Win or university, always crash even though we are in a digital era.” Many others complained that they only got the message “Co-Win server is facing issues. Please try later” on the website. Advocate Ankita Shah said, “I kept on trying for hours and happened to get registered late in the evening. Even, the list of centres was displayed. When I clicked on date displayed at the centres to fix appointment, it displayed a message ‘minimum age limit is 45 years for this centre’. The same message is displayed for almost all centres. I am very excited to get vaccine for myself, my husband and younger sister.” Social worker Nikunj Dayma said, “Covid-19 is widespread in the district. Government should have completed vaccination of all people by now. The centre needs to have a better system in place. Also, it has left it to the states to give free vaccination to 18+. Now, the state has announced delay in commencement. At least, the state should begin vaccination of vendors, hawkers, staff in shops and delivery boys, who daily come in contact with many people from May 1.” Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said, “Centres will be increased to 200 from existing 148. Timings will be the same, from 9am to 5pm for all centres, excluding seven where vaccination is being facilitated till 10pm. Around 17 lakh people are estimated to be over 18 years in the city, of which 4.1 lakh above 45 years have taken the jab. We have sought 13 lakh doses from the government.” Meanwhile, despite the civic body receiving 30,000 doses of Covishield a day ago, many centres had run out of stock by 12noon on Wednesday. Activist Narayan Ahuja said, “People, especially senior citizens, crowded at centres for second dose after returning for last two days. They are in a hurry to take the jab fearing rush and long wait after May 1. NMC distributed coupons to prevent crowding. A large number of people were disappointed after vaccination was stopped at many centres after administering dose to 50 people.” NMC officials said doses were distributed to centres as per their past performance to avoid wastage and storage. “There were 13,370 vaccinations in the city on Wednesday as against average of 7,000 per day in last week. Response was more than expected on Wednesday. Therefore, centres exhausted all the stock early in the day. Vaccination went on till evening at centres where performance was good in previous days, as had been given enough stock,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-vax-from-may-1-irks-18-many-unable-to-register-on-co-win-app/articleshow/82299019.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

This includes 321 tons of medical oxygen supplied by Food and Drug Administration, said additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi. “We also have an allocation of 850 tons of oxygen from the Centre, which is the highest allotment among all states. However, to pick up our quota from other states like Bihar, we need more tankers. Earlier, we had only 30-35 tankers, but there are 84 in the fleet now,” said Awasthi. The state has also activated its oxygen monitoring system, which is a first-of-its-kind 24x7 oxygen-tracking module which enables real-time monitoring of GPS-fitted tankers by district magistrates. “We will provide police escort to tankers where possible and open a green corridor for quick transport,” said Awasthi. The monitoring system was set up by Rodic Consultants Pvt Ltd in collaboration with Food and Drug Administration, department of medical education, department of medical health and family welfare and department of transport and home affairs. The oxygen control room which is running for some time now will provide minute-by-minute information on oxygen demand in hospitals in various districts, allotment and loading of oxygen in vehicles, live location of vehicles, supply and utilization of oxygen.

Speaking to TOI, chief secretary Somesh Kumar said the campaign in social media and other platforms, saying the government would go for a lockdown is incorrect.  “This is wrong and creating panic among people, and leading to an artificial shortage of essentials.

Kumar said that the situation in other states where lockdown was imposed is different, but things are under control in Telangana. “Don’t panic and rush to testing centres. Wear masks and stay at home,” Kumar urged. Earlier, home minister Mahmood Ali told reporters that CM K Chandrasekhar Rao was not interested in a lockdown as poor people suffer a lot. “Based on the situation after the night curfew and as per health department's recommendations, the CM will take a decision on these issues after April 30,” the home minister said.

Now people who do not have oxygen will not get Remdesivir either,” Justice Prathiba Singh said after the Centre submitted that under the protocol being followed, only patients on oxygen support were being given Remdesivir. The judge was hearing a plea by a Covid-positive lawyer who could get only three of the six doses of Remdesivir required. Following the court’s intervention, the lawyer got the remaining vials on Tuesday night. The court said it would consider later whether a medical committee should review if the protocols for administering Remdesivir needed any modification. “Don’t change the protocol only to reduce shortage. That is wrong. As a result, doctors are not able to prescribe Remdesivir,” it pointed out, calling it “complete mismanagement”. On the allocation of the drug to Delhi, Centre said that over 52,000 vials, of the allocated 72,000, had been sent to the capital till Tuesday. It said the allocation was being made on the basis of actual caseload of a state. The court, however, said the allocation could not be so low for Delhi. The court also said it was “shocking” that an MP was able to procure 10,000 vials of the medicine from Delhi for distribution in Maharashtra’s Ahmednagar. “This is shocking the conscience of the court. That 10,000 vials could have been given to patients in Delhi. There is complete mismanagement of the quota being received by the state.” The Centre then said that in the coming days, the allocation would increase as there would be a rise in production. Delhi government, represented by additional standing counsel Anuj Aggarwal, said it had received only 2,500 vials of the over 52,000. The court was informed that the rest was distributed via private channels to hospitals and patients. Delhi government, thereafter, told the court that in view of the private distribution of the drug, it had decided to create a portal only through which hospitals would be able to procure the medicine. The court, however, did not agree with the proposed system, saying many people who needed the medicine were not hospitalised due to lack of beds or were availing treatment at home. Justice Singh said the better option would be to allow the patient or family or attendant to place the request on the portal for the drug and, thereafter, the person could collect it from the hospital after making payment. The court added that this would ensure that 90% of the patients requiring Remdesivir received the medicine, while the number would be around 50% if only hospitals administered the drug. It directed Delhi government to put on hold the launch till the suggestions are incorporated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/it-appears-you-want-people-to-die-hc-to-centre/articleshow/82299069.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Tribal school to medical college amid pandemic, 15 students refuse to give up their ‘doctor’ dream||MUMBAI: In the midst of the pandemic and lockdown last October, 15 tribal students from Melghat in Amravati district managed to secure seats in medicine.  They thought they just one step away from realising their dream of becoming a doctor, but with physical lectures being cancelled amid the second wave, they are now back home struggling to attend online lectures due to poor internet connectivity and power cuts. These teenagers cleared class XII from the state-run ashramshala and NEET in October 2020 under the Ulgulan initiative, a collaboration of the state tribal development department, Integrated Tribal Development Project and Pune-based NGO Lift for Upliftment run by BJ Medical College to provide training and guidance to tribal students. Of the 15 students, eight got admission in government medical colleges for Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS), four each for Bachelor of Ayurveda, Medicine and Surgery (BAMS) and Bachelor of Homeopathic, Medicine and Surgery (BHMS), and two for Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS). A few of them attended college earlier this year, but after the second wave brought in lockdown-like restrictions, they were forced to return home. “I barely manage to attend lectures on a small cellphone in my village Zapal in Dharni taluka,” said Shantilal Kasdekar, a first-year BDS student of TN Medical College attached to Nair Hospital in Mumbai. “But I will pursue my dream. The pandemic will not deter me.” Renuka Patorekar, first-year BAMS student of a Ratnagiri college, commutes 25-30km daily from her home in Chipoli to her maternal uncle’s village for internet connection. “I’m not sure how long this lockdown will last, but I am sure I will soon attend college again,” she said. KC Padvi, tribal developme-nt minister, told TOI that the st-ate will ensure help to these students if they miss lectures or face any issues due to the lockdo-wn-like restrictions. “We are ha-ppy that they are working hard to fulfil their dream. We will ensure that next year, more students will get into medicine.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-tribal-school-to-medical-college-amid-pandemic-15-students-refuse-to-give-up-their-doctor-dream/articleshow/82300081.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

The man, who runs a consultancy business, transferred the amount via three transactions between March 19 and 24. After realizing that he had been duped, the man approached the police to lodge a complaint. Inspector Prakash Jadhav of the Dighi police told TOI that the two callers — a man and a woman — posed as executives of a leading private finance company. They contacted the complainant in March. “The woman first took all the details of the complainant and then offered him a loan of Rs10 lakh for his business,” Jadhav said. He said that the complainant told the callers that he wanted a loan in his wife’s name. “The complaint then sent the soft copies of his wife’s Aadhar card, payment slips and photographs to the suspects,” Jadhav said. The suspects told the complainant that he needed to pay EMIs of three months in advance. “The complainant first transferred Rs27,000 to a bank account number given to him. Later, he transferred Rs33,000 for the No Objection Cerficate (NOC) charges and Rs30,000 for GST,” Jadhav said. He said that the complaint became suspicious when the callers continued to demand money. “When he tried to contact the suspects for his queries, their cellphones were not reachable. He then realized that he had been duped,” Jadhav said. He said that prima facie probe revealed that the suspects were based in Uttar Pradesh and New Delhi. “We have registered a case under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Information Technology Act,” Jadhav said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bizman-duped-of-rs-90k-over-online-loan-offer/articleshow/82299048.cms||Mihir Tanksale

The accused, Beant Singh of Mari Mustafa in Baghapurana sub-division, is the main shooter of gangster Davinder Bambiha group. “He is wanted in cases of ransom and dacoity too. Beant was arrested along with his accomplice, Sunil Kumar of Moga. He too is facing over 12 criminal cases,” said Moga SSP Harmanbir Singh Gill. Police recovered five pistols — two .30 bore and three .32 bore — ammunition and drug powder from them, Gill said. He said in retaliation of Brar’ murder, the Bishnoi group had killed one Rana near Muktsar and then another Gurlal Bhalwan at Faridkot. “Beant has revealed he along with his accomplices Neeraj Chaska and Mandeep Mandy, both residents of Jaito in Faridkot, had killed Gurlal Brar to avenge the murder of Lavi Deora (associate of Bambiha group). He was killed by members of Bishnoi gang at a fair in Kotkapura in 2017,” the SSP said. Police have registered a case under Arms Act and NDPS Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sopu-ex-prez-killer-arrested/articleshow/82278237.cms||---
---||Delhi||Vaccine for above 18 in Delhi: Rush job sends tech crashing||NEW DELHI: Innumerable Delhiites in the 18-45 year age group complained of massive technical glitches while registering for Covid-19 vaccination on the government’s Co-Win portal and the Aarogya Setu mobile application.  From May 1, vaccination is open for all citizens above the age of 18 years. This phase of the vaccination drive, however, might be delayed in the capital because the required doses of vaccines are yet to acquired, sources in Delhi government said. The registration for the vaccination process for the newly eligible group began at 4pm on Wednesday, but was marred by glitches. Most people complained that they didn’t get an OTP (one-time password) and those who did, said that the portal was not allowing those older than 45 years old to register. Those who did manage to register said they faced problems uploading documents and then in scheduling the appointment. Registration and appointments are mandatory with walk-in not to be permitted. Isha Banerji, 26, editor at a publishing house, said, “I opened the Co-Win website to register at 4pm sharp. It took me a while to even login because the website kept crashing frequently. Then, after spending more than 10 minutes to generate the elusive OTP, I couldn’t even input my gender and photo ID type on the form because the option to add details in those categories was missing and refreshing several times didn’t work either.” On checking the dates for the entire month of May, it became clear to Banerji that none of the hospitals allowed booking for anyone below 45. “For the latter half of the month, there were no slots altogether. Why start registrations when the option to book slots is not even available? There are many people who don’t have access to technology or can’t handle it as well. How will they manage?” she asked. Tanya Anthwal, a psychologist, had a similar experience. “We tried to register at 6pm, but the app showed no available slots for May 1 onwards. Also, it displayed the vaccination as being open for those aged only over 45 years,” said Anthwal. Some people who tried to schedule an appointment for the vaccination on the Co-WIN portal on Wednesday said that many government centres in the capital where Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin vaccine will be administered were not accepting appointments. Government sources, however, said that there were no problems in getting Covaxin for those slated to get their second jab. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on April 26 that Delhi government had approved the purchase of 1.3 crore vaccines. Sources said the vaccines are yet to arrive and the vaccination drive might not begin, at least on a large scale, on May 1. “The only solution to the rapid rise in Covid case appears to be the vaccine. Delhi government has decided to administer the vaccine free of cost to all 18+ residents of Delhi,” Kejriwal had said on Monday. “It will be our effort to carry the inoculation drive swiftly and efficiently. Today we gave the go-ahead for the purchase of 1.34 crore vaccines for Delhi.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vaccine-for-above-18-rush-job-sends-tech-crashing/articleshow/82299054.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Patna||Night curfew extended in Bihar, shops to close at 4pm||PATNA: The state government has extended the period of night curfew by three hours, from 6pm to 6am, and ordered closure of shops and business establishments at 4pm, instead of 6pm from Thursday till May 15. Earlier, the night curfew was from 9pm to 5am. However, vegetable and fruit vendors are allowed to sell their items on the carts by moving around and restaurants can deliver the cooked food at customers’ homes till 9pm. The decisions were taken after a marathon meeting CM Nitish Kumar held with the crisis management group of the state on taking further measures to contain the surge of coronavirus cases. The state recorded 13,374 new Covid cases in the past 24 hours. Later, development commissioner Amir Subhani and principal secretary (health & disaster management) Pratyaya Amrit briefed the media about the decisions taken at the meeting. As per the home department’s notification, the number of guests has been reduced from 100 to 50 for marriage functions and from 25 to 20 at funerals. “However, the night curfew will be effective from 10pm in case of the wedding function. But the use of DJ will be banned in the wedding events,” the notification reads. “The district administration can stagger the markets to check crowds at such places. The administration can issue orders to open markets on alternate days, either region or mohalla wise. If required, the administration can put a ban on opening of mandi(s) located in highly populated areas or can shift them to other open places,” the notification says. “All government and private offices (except the offices related to the essential works) will function only with 25% attendance till 4pm daily. All employees will be encouraged to work from home. All government and private offices will be closed by 4pm,” the order reads. Subhani said the state government would meet the expenses for the performance of last rites of Covid-19 victims and also of those testing negative but having symptoms of the deadly virus. “For this, the urban development and housing department and the rural development department will authorize the urban local bodies and the block development officers, respectively, and allot necessary funds to them,” Subhani said. It was also decided to make ready all necessary medical infrastructures, including beds, piped oxygen, ventilators and oxygen concentrator machines, considering that the state has over 98,000 active Covid cases. “To meet the requirements of the active Covid patients, it was also decided to hold walk-in interviews to appoint necessary number of doctors, nurses, lab technicians and paramedical staff for a period of one year after creating temporary posts,” Subhani said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/night-curfew-extended-in-state-shops-to-close-at-4pm/articleshow/82297932.cms||Madan Kumar

The demand for each vial of the drug was Rs 60,000.The joint operation was conducted under the leadership of SDM (Defence Colony) Vinod Kumar Yadav after authorities received information that the lifesaving drug was being black-marketed by agents. Officials from the drug control department of Delhi Police were also part of the operation.The source had provided the contact of the person who was allegedly supplying the drug, and the officials sent a decoy customer to confirm its veracity. “Initially, a person named Suraj (canteen in-charge of hospital) met the decoy customer. He then introduced another person, Uttam, who gave the two vials of Remdesivir to the customer. Uttam was caught red-handed by the officials,” the district administration said in a statement.Delhi government has formed Special Task Forces in each of the 11 districts, which have been tasked with undertaking measures required for ensuring availability of the life-saving drugs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/crackdown-on-remdesivir-sale-in-black/articleshow/82299059.cms||---
---||Nagpur||After sister’s Covid death, builder provides O2 machines to others||NAGPUR: The oxygen concentrator that 45-year-old Baba Mendhe had purchased for elder sister turned him into a Covid warrior for the second time. During last year’s lockdown, Mendhe would take food packets to destitute families and migrants. This year, he has been rushing oxygen concentrators to the doorstep of the Covid patients for free. Mendhe, a builder, purchased an oxygen concentrator at double its original price as his sister required one immediately. Though his sister, having high co-morbidities, ultimately fell prey to coronavirus, Mendhe did not lose heart. He started using the same oxygen concentrator to save life of others. Starting off with one machine, Mendhe has now procured another four with a few more expected to reach soon. “First, I request for identity proof, oxygen reading and test report. This machine works only for those having oxygen level more than 90. I generally leave the machine with patients till their oxygen level stabilizes and request them not to hold it back as it can be passed on to the others,” said Mendhe who has already provided the machines to 70-80 patients in the last one week or so. Mendhe, who also run an NGO, said social work was a passion that drove his soul. “If someone is smitten by the social work bug, it propels one to run around helping others and saving lives. He or she would not stop at any given risk or constraints,” said Mendhe. “I did not use my NGO to do this work as it feels better as an individual to save someone from falling prey to Covid,” he added. Mendhe risks his life by helping Covid patients set up the machine, in case someone is not able to understand its functioning including senior citizens unable to learn it from the social media. “Generally, I ask the patient’s kin to learn the operation through YouTube and other social media. In case, there is no one able to do so, I have no choice but to fit it for them,” said Mendhe. “I do not earn anything from this work except blessings,” said Mendhe. “I approach the families or individuals who had used the concentrator requesting them to spare it for my work till the crisis ends,” he said. Mendhe has appealed to those having a spare oxygen concentrator and willing to provide it for free to patients can contact him on his cell number 7066700200.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-sisters-covid-death-builder-provides-o2-machines-to-others/articleshow/82299089.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Kolkata||Bengal: Govt beds in private hospitals only after panel nod||KOLKATA: Private hospitals must admit a patient to a government acquired bed in the facility only after Swasthya Bhawan admission cell’s nod. Without it, the state will not bear the patient’s cost. The government had requisitioned beds 20 to 200 at various private hospitals and nursing homes. Admission to government Covid facilities is centralised through the admission cell. The health department advisory on Wednesday said the cell should consider admission to a government facility first.  A team of doctors in the admission cell can recommend a patient to a private facility. The state will reimburse the charges for such a patient as per a fixed rate. The government has also requisitioned beds in district private hospitals. Admission cells of each district have been asked to maintain a daily record of patients admitted. “The admission cell should give due priority to recommendations and directions that come from district magistrates and CMOH,” said the advisory. The health department also empowered principals of medical colleges, superintendents of government hospitals and CMOHs of health districts to expand Covid care facilities on their own after informing Swasthya Bhawan. The government has deputed 15 doctors to the Kolkata Police Hospital. Sources in the health department said private hospitals are yet to respond to a proposal from the state govt task force to convert Nicco Park into a hospital. The Kishore Bharati Stadium that Medica Super Specialty Hospital has adopted as an annex Covid unit is expected to become operational on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/govt-beds-in-pvt-hospitals-only-after-panel-nod/articleshow/82297945.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Delhi||Spread out: How to make vax for all safe & secure||NEW DELHI: As India plans to expand the criteria for vaccination against Covid-19 to include younger people, those above 18 years, there is a palpable excitement among many waiting for the jab. On Wednesday, there were lakhs of hits on the Co-Win app to register for vaccination, which reflected the keenness among the intended beneficiaries to get vaccinated and to protect themselves from the disease that has killed thousands across the country. However, experts fear the rush expected for the jab in the initial days may lead to super-spreader events if safety protocols like physical distancing aren’t followed properly. “Vaccination is the only way out of this crisis. But it has to be done in a manner that the process itself doesn’t become a super-spreader event. For this, we need to ensure that visits should be allowed in a staggered manner. The centres could use a token system or pre-booked appointment for this,” Dr Randeep Guleria, the director of AIIMS, said. He added that many countries have utilised open spaces such as playgrounds and stadiums to vaccinate people in large numbers while ensuring physical distancing. “We can adopt this here as well because the available vaccines – both Covaxin and Covishield – have been administered to many without any serious complication,” Guleria said. Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology division of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said everyone, including the healthcare workers, other staff and intended beneficiaries, should be screened and anyone having symptoms of Covid-19 shouldn’t be allowed inside the centre.  “The entrance, screening area, registration area, payment zone and waiting area for vaccination should be the focal points. Authorities should ensure there is no crowding in such places. There should be at least one-meter distance between people—be it the staff or the intended beneficiaries—at all points,” Dr Kant said. According to Dr HS Chhabra, medical director of Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, they plan to accept only those who have registered online on Co-Win portal and Aarogya Setu app. “We have shifted the venue for vaccination to a bigger place. There are separate enclosures for vaccination and observation. We have also totally separated Covid and non-Covid pathways in the hospital so that there is no intermingling in any manner,” he said. At Akash hospital in Dwarka, the doctors said they have two vaccination sites of which one of them has been reserved for people above 45 years of age and the other to those aged between 18 and 44 years. “All necessary steps of thermal scanning, sanitisation and social distancing measures are being taken to safeguard the interest of people coming for vaccination,” said Dr Kousar A Shah, COO, Aakash Healthcare. However, there are many hospitals which maintain there aren’t enough vaccines available. “We are getting 200-300 vaccines daily. How are we going to cater to the huge demand expected once the process is opened to all above 18 years? Also, we haven’t received any guidelines or directions from the government as yet,” said an official from one of the major private hospital chains. Unlike the first wave of Covid-19 in India, when complications were seen mostly among the elderly and those with comorbidities, doctors say they are finding many young people developing severe symptoms in the current outbreak.  Deaths have also increased in the younger patients, which is a worrisome trend.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/spread-out-how-to-make-vax-for-all-safe-secure/articleshow/82299065.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

---||Ranchi||Intel-gathering on LWE suffers lockdown blues||RANCHI: The restrictions on the movement of people during the ongoing Swasthya Suraksha Saptah have caused a scarcity of intelligence inputs for Jharkhand Police regarding left-wing extremist (LWE) activities in the state. Police sources said that with the movement of people from villages to towns reducing, the gathering of inputs through man-to-man contact has been affected. The police are, however, getting information through other means like the mobile phones. Additional director general of police (operation) R K Mallick admitted the slowdown in intelligence inputs saying, “Almost all the operations in state are based on intelligence inputs. Police are also able to prevent Maoists violence based on inputs provided by locals. Hopefully, the situation would normalize after restrictions owing to Covid-19 pandemic are removed.” The lockdown has had little impact on the extremists who has indulged in violence in the last few days. Notably, a railway track was damaged in East Singhbhum district on April 26 when the CPI(Maoist) had given a call for Bharat bandh. Several vehicles were burnt in Chatra district a day after. In a related development, Ranchi police have arrested an active member of splinter extremist outfit JJMP under the Mccluskiegunj police station area on Tuesday night. The accused, Anil Lohra, was caught with a gun and a mobile phone. Rural SP Naushad Alam said that the accused was demanding levy from the contractors and the brick kiln factory owners of the area. Police carried out a raid near Dhamdhamia to nab the accused. Lohra’s accomplice, however, managed to flee away from the spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/intel-gathering-on-lwe-suffers-lockdown-blues/articleshow/82299047.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Jamshedpur||Lack of antigen kits in S-K halts test drive||JAMSHEDPUR: Seraikela-Kharsawan administration’s planned mass Covid-19 testing drive in Adityapur and other parts of the district has been halted by the unavailability of Rapid Antigen Testing (RAT) kits. “As on Wednesday morning, there were just 500 RAT kits available. Hence mass testing drives, which were planned in Adityapur industrial area, have been stopped,” a senior district health official said requesting anonymity. There is no RT-PCR testing facility in the district. The samples collected are sent to Jamshedpur for examination. Health officials were focusing on mass testing through RAT after Covid-19 cases rose exponentially in the past fortnight. As on Tuesday night, there were 840 active cases. As many as 11 people in the district died in the past fortnight. The shortage of kits has forced the officials to go easy on the planned screening of the thousands of workers in the Adityapur industrial area. “There are 1,000 industrial units in Adityapur that employ nearly 50,000 people,” officials said. Officials said the state health department was allocating RAT kits to the districts based on their respective population density and the number of active cases. “Hence, our district is getting less kits compared to others,” they added. The shortage of kits also compelled health officials to change their strategy. Localities such as Sini, Gamharia and Rajnagar, which reported new infections, were being targeted for testing. That apart, RAT kits were now being put to use to test the contact persons of active patients. “Due to the shortage of the kits, the health department is conducting tests on a targeted basis so that people who deserve to be tested on priority are targeted,” civil surgeon Dr Himanshu Barwar said. The district has reported 4,748 Covid-19 cases till Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/lack-of-antigen-kits-in-s-k-halts-test-drive/articleshow/82298995.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Ranchi||Add 50 general beds in all Covid facilities: CM||RANCHI/SINDRI: Chief minister Hemant Soren on Wednesday said the state health department has been directed to add at least 50 general beds in all government and private hospitals as a step-down-facility for Covid-19 patients who are out of ventilator and oxygen support but require medical monitoring. “With rising cases, the hospitals are facing shortages of oxygen supported beds. However, it is being seen that many patients with mild symptoms are still using oxygen-supported beds,” Soren said after inaugurating a 40-bed oxygen-supported hospital built by Ranchi Municipal Corporation in Ratu Road. Soren’s office later issued a press release stating he has asked health officials to constitute an expert team of doctors from Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences and private hospitals of the city to check the condition of infected patients at Ranchi sadar hospital and ascertain if they can be moved to non-oxygen beds. Meanwhile, the Dhanbad district administration has decided to monitor the vital parameters of all Covid-19 patients admitted in ICU wards of different government and private hospitals on a daily basis and shift those found stable after treatment to non-ICU beds. The decision has been taken to ensure ICU beds for needy patients with lower oxygen saturation running helter-skelter for ICU beds. Dhanbad deputy commissioner Uma Shankar Singh said on analysis of reports submitted to the Covid control room, it has been observed that several patients are not relinquishing ICU beds despite improvement in their condition. As a result, the administration is finding it difficult to arrange ICU beds on time for more needy patients with oxygen saturation below 65. The District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has directed all covid care centres along with government and private hospitals to shift all stable patients from ICU to non-ICU wards with maintaining treatment protocol and discharge that are found fit to be discharged. For this all the covid care centres have been asked to submit vital parameters of all patients admitted to ICU wards on a daily basis. The DDMA has also decided to provide RAT kits to all private hospitals for testing all the patients admitted to ICU and non-ICU wards so that they can be discharged from hospitals immediately as and when required.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/add-50-general-beds-in-all-cov-facilities-cm/articleshow/82297892.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Ghagra residents complain of air pollution, fear contracting virus||RANCHI: Residents of Ghagra complained of environment pollution and said they fear contracting Covid-19 due to the round-the-clock cremation of infected corpses in the area. Corpses of the deceased Covid-19 patients are being cremated at the ghat for nearly a month now after the Ranchi Municipal Corporation owned gas-fired incinerator at Mukti Dham developed a snag and went out of order for several days. Kaushal Kishore Mishra, a resident of the area, said, “The mass burning of bodies is causing so much pollution that we are forced to shut our doors and windows. The strong smell arising out of rituals saturates the entire atmosphere.” Mishra added that locals fear going near the ghat as infected PPE kits are scattered all over the place. “Municipal workers and relatives of deceased persons are throwing away medical waste in the open before leaving which is also a major cause of concern,” he said. Another resident Nawlesh Kumar said, “My children fell ill due to the prevailing atmosphere and I was forced to shift to my relatives house.” Meanwhile, in a letter to Ranchi deputy commissioner and Ranchi Municipal Corporation another resident Dheeraj Kumar, who is also the treasurer of Advocate Association of Jharkhand high court, said, “Residents are facing the risk of contracting Covid-19, while toxic medical wastes and the fumes from the pyres are suffocating and causing air pollution.” He also said that rate of infection in Ghagra is growing and several people have succumbed to the disease. He demanded the cremation ground to be shifted elsewhere as the fire is also posing threat to the overhead bridge. Kumar suggested two full electric cremation furnaces to be installed in Ranchi and the number of cremations at Ghagra to be restricted. He stated that more places must be identified for the last rites in the city. Asking the administration to look into the issues, Kumar said, “The disposal of medical wastes in the open must be stopped. The burning of dead bodies should not take place in the night hours.” Commenting on the matter, Ranchi SDO Utkarsh Gupta said, “The administration will take steps for proper disposal of medical wastes. We are also searching for more venues for the last rites of Covid patients.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ghagra-residents-complain-of-air-pollution-fear-contracting-virus/articleshow/82297852.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Goa||Cong: Govt clueless,needs full-time guv||Panaji: Despite being clueless on how to manage the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the BJP-led state government refuses to consider the constructive suggestions made by the opposition, said the Congress party here on Wednesday.  Opposition leader Digambar Kamat said that the lack of a full-time governor for Goa only makes the situation worse.  Congress also said that the three-day partial lockdown announced by chief minister Pramod Sawant was a “blessing in disguise” for the state. Kamat said that with the rising Covid-19 cases and ‘unstoppable deaths’ people need to take utmost care of their health, maintain social distancing and follow strict Covid protocol.  Highlighting the pro-active role played by former Goa governor Satya Pal Malik, Kamat has urged the Centre to appoint a full-time governor who could help arrest the deteriorating Covid situation in Goa. “Today, no one knows what is happening in the state. Ministers are making announcements contradicting the chief minister and government officials appear clueless. Now, local panchayats are announcing lockdowns. Are we heading towards anarchy,” said Kamat.  Kamat said that Bhagat Singh Koshyari, who is the governor of Goa and Maharashtra is rarely available and has is hands full with the affairs of Maharashtra which is facing an acute Covid crisis.  Reacting to Union defence minister Rajnath Singh’s meeting with governors and Lt governors where he urged them to take the help of ex- servicemen, nurses, lab technicians and retired army personnel to deal with the Covid crisis, Kamat said that Singh should impress upon the prime minister to appoint a full-time governor for Goa. “There is no scope for us to escalate the matter to the governor as he is not available full time in Goa,” said Kamat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-govt-cluelessneeds-full-time-guv/articleshow/82300179.cms||---

---||Vadodara||Fire breaks out at Sayajigunj underpass||Vadodara: Fire broke out at Sayajigunj underpass on Wednesday evening, bringing the vehicular movement to a halt on the RC Dutt Road. Firemen doused the flames within 15 minutes. Traffic density on the stretch was low at the time of the incident so no casualties were reported. According to fire brigade officials, a short-circuit in the advertising boards installed inside the underpass caused the fire. “The advertising boards’ material caught fire and soon the flames leapt out of the underpass that connects Sayajigunj with Alkapuri,” said Parth Brahmbhatt, fire officer. The hoardings installed at the end of the underpass too went up in flames and locals said that they could see smoke billowing in the skies from several kilometres away. The railway authorities had to delay the train movement for about 15 minutes as the rail tracks runs above the underpass. When asked if the tracks suffered any damage, Brahmbhatt said, “It wasn’t a high intensity fire so the tracks didn’t suffer any damage. The rail movement resumed after some time.” Three fire-fighting vans reached the spot within few minutes and doused the fire. Investigations have begun to know the exact cause of the fire.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/fire-breaks-out-at-sayajigunj-underpass/articleshow/82297275.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Hazaribag runs out of timber amid spike in Covid deaths||HAZARIBAG: Hazaribag is running out of timber to cremate the bodies of Covid-19 patients and of those who are succumbing to other causes. The kin of deceased Covid patients are waiting for hours, sometimes throughout the night, at the burning ghat on the banks of Konar river, which has been earmarked to cremate Covid-19 victims. The administration, however, has not made any arrangements to ensure an unhindered supply of timber. “Due to the rise in the number of Covid deaths, the burning ghats are facing an acute shortage of timber. Last year, we tried to make the defunct electric crematorium operational. A tender was floated, inviting interested parties to convert the electric crematorium into a gas-fired facility. One company had shown interest last November but later backed out without giving any explanation,” Hazaribag municipal commissioner Madhavi Mishra told TOI. When contacted, deputy commissioner Aditya Kumar Anand said, “We are doing everything to make the crematorium functional again.” He, however, did not comment on the scarcity of timber at the burning ghats. As many as 57 people have died of Covid till date in Hazaribag, with six deaths taking place on Tuesday. Seeing the surge in fatalities, many are voluntarily stepping forward to help out the families in cremating the Covid victims. Mohammad Khalid, who heads Murda Kalyan Samiti here, reached out to the city-based timber depot owners, seeking logs for setting up pyers. Munna Singh, a city-based timber depot owner, donated 216 quintals of timber for lighting up 36 pyres. Each quintal costs around Rs 2,000. However, Singh did not charge money from some of the victims’ kin as many of them could not afford to pay for the last rites of their deceased family members. “We purchase timber in auction from the forest department and from West Bengal. But the department seems to be reluctant in auctioning off timber at this hour of crisis. I request the government to auction the logs which are lying next to the NH-33 stretch in Barhi for this purpose,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hbag-runs-out-of-timber-amid-spike-in-covid-deaths/articleshow/82297926.cms||Abhijit Sen
---||Nagpur||In 11 days, 152 ‘superspreaders’ quarantined in NMC, police RAT drive||NAGPUR: The Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) drive against those violating Covid curbs launched by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and city police has ensured 152 ‘superspreaders’ were nabbed in 11 days, and isolated at institutional quarantine centres.  All these persons were out during the curbs put in place to break the corona chain, and did not have any idea they were Covid positive until subjected to the RAT, and hence spreading the infection to others unknowingly. Kickstarted on April 17, the drive was initiated to instil fear in the minds of aimless loiterers and casual violators, who venture out from home without valid reasons. The measure was devised after violators were unfazed by actions like fines for not wearing masks, violation of social distancing and vehicle detention. Maximum tests were conducted on April 18, when 434 persons were put through the RAT and 18 were sent to the quarantine centres after testing positive. In total, 3,245 tests have been conducted and 152 were sent to quarantine centres. Though it could not be found out how many stayed at the quarantine centres for how long, and if any contact tracing could be done. City police chief Amitesh Kumar and NMC chief Radhakrishnan B had started the drive. Kumar said the drive would be strengthened in the coming days with the main purpose of isolating and quarantining superspreaders while also penalising people taking the curbs lightly. “Asymptomatic superspreaders are the most lethal for the city’s population as they roam around without any restrictions and spread the disease, which we are aiming to stop. We need to pull up people for being careless about curbs,” he said. The CP also said the drive would be intensified. “After starting at five places, we had conducted the drive at six places on Wednesday and would contemplate changing the locations and increase the manpower as per the ongoing assessment,” he said. On Wednesday, city police had conducted 234 tests till 1pm and detected 13 superspreaders apart from fining 53 for not wearing masks and another 305 for violating social distancing norms. Police also detained 189 vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/in-11-days-152-superspreaders-quarantined-in-nmc-police-rat-drive/articleshow/82299256.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||Goon’s illegal lawn ‘Rajmahal’, built on encroached land, razed||NAGPUR: The ‘Rajmahal’ lawn constructed by notorious goon Ranjit Safelkar on a 3-acre plot by encroaching upon a state’s irrigation department canal was on Wednesday brought down by the anti-encroachment squad of Kamptee Municipal Council with protection provided by Nagpur police. DCP (crime) Gajanan Rajmane said the KMC team equipped with excavators started demolishing Safelkar’s wedding lawn, which also housed Safelkar’s sprawling bungalow. The Nagpur police crime branch has arrested Safelkar, his accomplices Bharat Hate, Kalu Hate, Ishaq Maske and Hemant Gorkha Batho in the Manish Shrivas murder case. After their police custody ended on Wednesday, the Kalamna police arrested them in a extortion case. Rajmane told TOI the information about this property (market price estimated at Rs 9 crore) came to fore during Safelkar’s custodial interrogation. During investigation, it also came to fore that no permission or sanction was taken for the wedding lawn from any of the authorities, the DCP said. Sources said Safelkar had approached Nagpur Metro Regional Development Authority for sanction of the lawn, but it was rejected. Sources, however, wondered how the irrigation department officials kept mum over Safelkar’s brazen encroachment of the canal. Safelkar had also forcibly occupied a MTDC resort in the Ramtek area. The contract to run the MTDC resort was allotted to some other person. However, Safelkar using his muscle power took possession of the resort and was running the same for the last couple of years. The price of that property is pegged at Rs 12 crore. “He had also rented out one of his illegal properties to a wine shop, which too came to fore,” he said. Safelkar was booked under stringent MCOCA after an extortion case. The police have charged Safelkar with murder, extortion and forcible possession of property. Rajmane said that 20 to 25 more complaints have been filed against the goon and the process to file FIRs was underway. Besides, Nagpur Municipal Corporation had confirmed that Safelkar had forcibly occupied eight more properties in the city. Safelkar was also allegedly involved into supari killing of city architect Eknath Nimgade. He had reportedly taken Rs 5 crore for it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/goons-illegal-lawn-rajmahal-built-on-encroached-land-razed/articleshow/82299279.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Nagpur||Jayoti Banerjee to head Melghat Tiger Reserve||NAGPUR: In what could be a damage control exercise in the aftermath of Harisal RFO Deepali Chavan’s suicide case last month, the state government on Wednesday appointed Jayoti Banerjee as the first woman officer to head Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR), the country’s fourth biggest and one of the oldest tiger reserves. Banerjee, an IFS officer of 2003 batch who was conservator of forest (CF) with social forestry department (SFD), Thane, has been posted as field director of Melghat on promotion as chief conservator of forest (CCF). The post has been downgraded from APCCF to CCF. It was earlier held by APCCF MS Reddy, who is under suspension. After Chavan’s suicide, normalcy has not yet returned and many women employees are still apprehensive about working in the tiger reserve, especially after the harassment meted out to the staff by suspended Gugamal deputy conservator (DyCF) Vinod Shivkumar. “It was necessary to send a message to the field by appointing a woman officer. We need to remove fear among staff and change the working environment there. We have posted Wadsa DyCF Niranjan Vivrekar at Gugamal. Now, the entire team is young and energetic. I trust things will be all right,” said Milind Mhaiskar, principal secretary (forest). Banerjee told TOI, “I’m joining with an open mind and it’s a big responsibility and challenge to work in Melghat with many burning issues at hand. It will be a learning experience too. We will work as a team.” On Wednesday, the government affected a major reshuffle in the department by replacing Maharashtra State Biodiversity Board (MSBB) member-secretary Jeet Singh as PCCF (production & management). As reported by TOI, Singh was in trouble for working from Pune despite being posted in Nagpur. PCCF (P&M) Praveen Srivastava has been sent to the biodiversity board now. The government has promoted and posted controversial Naresh Zurmure as the state’s nodal officer. He will replace Sanjeev Gaur, who has been shifted to FDCM as chief general manager (CGM). Amravati CCF Pravin Chavan has been promoted and posted as APCCF (protection), a post lying vacant since long. The vacant post of Maharashtra Bamboo Development Board (MBDB) has been filled by Srinivasa Rao, who was CGM at FDCM. Surprisingly, CCF SV Ramarao, who was posted at Yavatmal last year, has been transferred to Thane. Ramarao was investigating the tigress death case in Mukutban. The Yavatmal CCF post has been downgraded as CF with the posting of PJ Lonkar. Nagpur DyCF Prabhu Nath Shukla has also been shifted to Ballarshah. He will be replaced by Bharat Singh Hada. There are other 10 DyCFs who have been shunted out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/jayoti-banerjee-to-head-melghat-tiger-reserve/articleshow/82299322.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Vadodara||Remdesivir black marketing racket busted; 90 injections seized, 5 caught||Vadodara: One of the biggest rackets selling remdesivir injections in black was busted by sleuths of the crime branch who not only arrested five men from the city, but also seized 90 vials of the life saving injection. Investigating officials suspect that the racket may have many more persons involved in it. “It was an organized racket wherein the accused used to source remdesivir injections and sell them for Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000 apiece. The crime branch had received a tip-off on the basis of which we first nabbed an agent who led us to the other four accused,” said Shamsher Singh, city police commissioner. Based on information that DCP (crime) Jaydeepsinh Jadeja had received about one Rishi Jedh, a resident of Ellora Park, who was to sell some remdesivir injections in Subhanpura area on Wednesday, cops kept vigil and caught Jedh who was carrying 17 vials with the brand name COVIFOR. Jedh told the police that he had got the injections from a medical store staff at Shroff Foundation Hospital in Kalali, Vikas Patel. Cops asked Jedh to call up Vikas asking for more injections. “We then trapped Patel who was carrying 12 injections with him. He revealed getting 75 injections from Jatin Patel, owner of Jaynam Pharma in Anand. Patel used to sell each injection for Rs13,500,” Jadeja said. Vikas told cops he sold 25 injections to a friend Pratik Panchal, who was trapped by cops along with his partner Manan Shah from Sama Savli Road. “We also arrested Jatin Patel of Jaynam Pharma who revealed he purchased the vials from Vivek Shah who owns D K Enterprise that sells medical equipment in Vadodara,” Singh added. Cops picked up Shah for questioning. The gang confessed to selling nearly 300 injections in black in the past two months. Apart from the 90 injections, cops also seized Rs 2.05 lakh in cash besides mobile phones. Earlier, city police had busted another drug racket on April 11 and arrested two men.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/remdesivir-black-marketing-racket-busted-90-injections-seized-5-caught/articleshow/82297294.cms||---

---||Nagpur||PF, FDs, gold loans, mutual funds all point to Covid effect on financial health||NAGPUR: Covid continues to take its toll on the financial health of the middle income group. Talking to bankers, investment advisors, insurance agents and other professionals in finance sector shows that the struggle continues, though there are some indications of improvement. There has been a major dip in contributions to the Employees Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) during the last financial year. EPFO contributions are directly related to the salary levels. At over Rs1,000 crore, the PF contribution for the financial year ending on March 20, was already down as compared to the year before. Against this, nearly Rs800 crore were withdrawn by EPFO subscribers from the Nagpur office, which covers eastern Vidarbha, during 2019-20. For financial year 2020-21 the contribution is expected to go down further by 30%. More than 50% increase in withdrawals is also estimated, said a source. EPFO withdrawals happen on termination of job, retirement or else when funds are needed to tide over a crisis. EPFO covers private sector workers. As the salary levels for contribution is capped at Rs15,000, the scheme mainly covers low income workers. An impact has been seen on the savings too. Bankers reported dip in fixed deposits and even savings accounts. This was attributed to requirements of funds due to dwindling incomes or Covid treatment. Private lenders said even if their shops are closed due to lockdown there have been a number of inquiries for pledging gold to get loans since last 20-25 days. The calls are from relatives of Covid patients in need of money. “The fixed deposits as on March 2020 stood at Rs6,000 odd crore, it came down to Rs5,300 odd crore as on March 2021. In April, there is a growth of Rs60 odd crore,” said a senior official in one of the PSU banks having a regional office at Nagpur. Even as officials of other banks refused to share the details, there were reports of deposits having gone down in general. This can also be due to falling interest rates, said a source. Mutual fund agent GV Iyer said, “There were mutual fund redemptions to meet urgent expenses earlier. The figures may not be much. At our end it is around 5% in terms of value and number of accounts.” Parag Paranjpe of Think Consultants, an investment advisory firm, said there have been minor redemptions. Falling incomes levels did lead to stopping of further investment in systematic investment plans (SIPs). The remaining corpus remains largely intact, he said. Insurance agent Bharat Parekh said March was beyond expectations both in the country as well as Nagpur office. There is a marked dip in April collections of first premium, especially in Nagpur. It may be nearly half of the collections last April. Sukesh Zanwar, managing director of Buldhana Urban Cooperaitve Bank, said loan against gold touched Rs100 crore in the cooperative during the Covid period. No other lending except loans against gold is happening these days, he said. Jewellers Vatsal Bangre and Pawan Rokde also confirmed calls from patients’ relatives to get loans against gold.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pf-fds-gold-loans-mutual-funds-all-point-to-covid-effect-on-financial-health/articleshow/82299355.cms||Shishir Arya

The victim, a teacher, had been lured to spend a romantic evening at a desolate place along Nagpur-Jabalpur Highway on April 24. The gay mastermind and his three accomplices, all facing financial crisis due to the ongoing lockdown, left the teacher injured after robbing him. The mastermind, working as a window fitter specialized in aluminium frames, had prima facie plotted the robbery to get some fast cash as the ongoing lockdown has left him without a steady income. He was also habituated to purchase narcotics on a daily basis. He roped in three accomplices to play the armed ‘robbery’ drama. In the past, gangs have robbed couples seeking privacy at desolate places along the highway. The mastermind wanted to project the robbery as one such incident. The gang ran out of luck after cops from Hudkeshwar police station managed to unearth the facts from the mastermind during interrogation. They became suspicious after the versions of the mastermind and those of the victim partner did not match. After arresting all four the day after the fake robbery, police found most of the valuables wrenched from the teacher from the gang. The teacher had been lured by the mastermind to come along with him, with the promise of giving him Rs200 and also spend some time together enjoying. The victim and the mastermind have had several such romantic encounters in the past. The teacher decided to go with the mastermind presuming it would no different an evening than what they had spent on several occasions. Police said the mastermind had taken the teacher to a desolate place on a bike. They were enjoying when the three accomplices rushed to the place and started thrashing them as per their plan. The mastermind sneaked away from the place before the others robbed the teacher. The crime was detected after the teacher registered an offence. HOW IT WAS DETECTED Hudkeshwar police team of API Swapnil Bhujbal, head constable Deepak More and others noticed the mastermind had some chilli powder on his hair, but not on his face or rest of the body Victim teacher had chilli powder on his entire body Police said mastermind sprinkled some chilli powder on himself during the drama Mastermind confessed to robbery trap during interrogation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gay-man-scripts-drama-to-rob-partner-of-valuables-to-overcome-lockdown-crisis/articleshow/82299358.cms||Soumitra Bose

Testing infrastructure is reportedly constrained in many locations. Hospitals are reporting shortages of supplies, oxygen, and beds for both Covid and non-Covid-related patients. US citizens are reporting being denied admittance to hospitals in some cities due to a lack of space.” The alert said the CDC had issued a Level 4 Travel Health Notice and the state department a Level 4 Travel Advisory, its highest. It urged “US citizens to enroll in STEP at step.state-.gov in order to receive critical information related to health and safety in India”. In the past week, about 20 countries have either suspended passenger flights from India for varying periods of time or imposed strict entry norms for travellers from here. Some countries are not allowing entry to travellers who have been in India for the previous 14 days. These include Canada, UK, Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Iran, UAE, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bangladesh, Maldives, Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand. People can travel from India to some of these places only if they have spent more than 14 days in a third country and have a negative Covid test report from that place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/leave-india-as-soon-as-its-safe-us-advises-citizens/articleshow/82301509.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: No hospital bed or oxygen, 68-year-old dies 10 days after testing Covid positive||GURUGRAM: Ten days ago, Naresh (name changed) tested positive for Covid-19. When his health started deteriorating quickly, his family members went from one hospital to another looking for a bed to ensure timely treatment. They found none. The family then decided to treat Naresh at home. But on Tuesday, his oxygen saturation levels started dropping alarmingly and fell to 27. “We tried all the government helpline numbers and several leads from social media but could not get an oxygen cylinder anywhere,” Naresh’s brother Rakesh told TOI. They reached out to many friends and family members for help too, he said. A flicker of hope came when the family managed to find an oxygen cylinder in Kaithal, about 200km from Gurugram, but Naresh passed away before it could reach his house. He left behind his wife, a son and a 91-year-old mother who is still not aware that her son is no more. “We lost him before we could get the oxygen. We received no help at all from the government’s end. We tried their helplines several times and failed to get a response,” an angry and upset Rakesh said. The nightmare did not end there for the family. They could not find an ambulance to take the body for the last rites. “We kept the body at home all night. We managed to find an ambulance in the morning, but it charged us Rs 50,000,” said Rakesh. He added that he did get a response from the government ambulance, but was told it would be available in four hours. For the family, it was too little, too late. Hitting out at the healthcare infrastructure, which the second surge of the pandemic has overwhelmed, Rakesh said, “For 10 days, we could not find a single hospital bed for my brother. We could not find oxygen and then we could not cremate him in time. I just don’t want anyone else to go through the struggle we faced. I hope the government wakes up and takes measures for others who need hospitals and ambulances.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/no-hosp-bed-or-oxygen-68-yr-old-dies-10-days-after-testing-ve/articleshow/82299554.cms||Shubhra Pant
---||Vadodara||Twice -ve Tanzanian dies,nCov infection suspected||Vadodara: When he travelled from far away Tanzania to the M S University (MSU) here, to pursue a PhD degree, hardly anyone would have expected a tragic end to his journey. But Emmanuel Harrison Ngowi who was suspected to be suffering from Covid-19 breathed his last at the GMERS Gotri Hospital on Monday night. Ngowi (34) was pursuing his PhD at the department of business economics of the Faculty of Commerce of the university. He had joined the university just a month back. Officials said that he was a lecturer in Tanzania and had taken a leave to pursue PhD here. “Ngowi was unwell for some time and thus went for a Covid-19 test. But his results were negative,” said director of the Office of International Affairs (OIA) Prof Dhanesh Patel. Ngowi was, however, treated as a Covid patient because he was displaying all the symptoms associated with the viral infection. Patel said that after treatment at the Yagnapurush Hall in Atladara he was shifted GMERS Gotri Hospital as his condition deteriorated. “All possible treatment was made available to him at the hospital. We kept in touch with his family and kept them informed about the developments,” said Patel. Ngowi’s oxygen saturation kept going down despite being on a BIPAP machine. He had tested negative once again during the course of the treatment. Ngowi died at the Gotri Hospital on Monday night. Sources in the hospital said that as per the protocol the body of a person who has tested negative can be handed over to relatives. “The family is trying to take the body to Tanzania. The Tanzanian high commission in Delhi is also helping the family,” said Patel. Ngowi is survived by his parents and a younger sister. The sister left a moving message she wished to be read to Ngowi. Patel said that the university was in touch with both the family and the high commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/twice-ve-tanzanian-diesncov-infection-suspected/articleshow/82297316.cms||---
---||India||SC: Protect disabled women who face threat of violence||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court batted strongly for more systemic protection to disabled and caste-oppressed women saying they live under a constant threat of violence, both physical and sexual, that curtails their constitutionally guaranteed right to lead a full and active life. "For many disabled women and girls in India, the threat of violence is an all too-familiar fixture of their lives, contracting their constitutionally guaranteed freedom to move freely and curtailing their ability to lead full and active lives. This threat of violence can translate into a nagging feeling of powerlessness and lack of control, making the realization of the promises held by Parts III and IV of our Constitution a remote possibility for women with disabilities," said a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah on Tuesday. Upholding the life sentence awarded to one Patan Jamal Vali of Andhra Pradesh for sexually assaulting a blind girl, who was the sister of his friend, the bench said women with disabilities are more susceptible to sexual violence as the accused perceives that the testimony of the rape survivor would not be fool proof because of her physical impairments Writing the judgment, Justice Chandrachud said, "we do not mean to subscribe to the stereotype that persons with disabilities are weak and helpless, incapable of charting the course of their lives or to deprive them of the agency and bodily autonomy that we all possess and are entitled to exercise. Such a negative presumption of disability translating into incapacity would be inconsistent with the forward-thinking conceptualization of disabled lives embodied in our law and, increasingly, albeit slowly, in our social consciousness." "Instead, our aim is to highlight the increased vulnerability and reliance on others that is occasioned by having a disability which makes women with disabilities more susceptible to being at the receiving end of sexual violence. As the facts of this case make painfully clear, women with disabilities, who inhabit a world designed for the able-bodied, are often perceived as 'soft targets' and 'easy victims' for the commission of sexual violence. It is for this reason that our legal response to such violence, in the instant case as well as at a systemic level, must exhibit attentiveness to this salient fact," Justice Chandrachud said. The bench said testimony of a prosecutrix with a disability, or of a disabled witness for that matter, cannot be considered weak or inferior, only because such an individual interacts with the world in a different manner, vis-a-vis their able-bodied counterparts. "..the court appreciating such testimony needs to be attentive to the fact that the witness’ disability can have the consequence of the testimony being rendered in a different form, relative to that of an able-bodied witness," the bench said. The court also drew attention to the feminist movements failing to take note of ill-treatment of caste-oppressed women by the upper caste women. It said, "the mainstream feminist movement also failed to take into consideration the specific forms of oppression that SC & ST women face not only at the hands of upper caste men but also upper caste women." The SC said this case is an exploration of the symptomatic of a trend of sexual violence against women and girls with disabilities and intended to set in motion a thought process for how the structural realities resulting in this state of affairs can be effectively addressed. However, it said that lamentably in India, there is no disaggregated data maintained on the extent of violence against women and girls with disabilities. "This poses a formidable obstacle to understanding the problem better and designing suitable solutions," it said. It quoted a 2004 survey in Orissa conducted in 12 districts with 729 respondents, which found that nearly all of the women and girls with disabilities surveyed were beaten at home, and 25% of women with intellectual disabilities had been raped. It quoted another 2011 study, which found that 21% of the 314 women with disabilities surveyed had faced emotional, physical or sexual violence from someone other than their intimate partner. The bench laid down some guidelines to make the criminal justice system more disabled-friendly: *The National Judicial Academy and state judicial academies are requested to sensitize trial and appellate judges to deal with cases involving survivors of sexual abuse *The Bar Council of India can consider introducing courses in the LL.B program that cover these topics and the intersectional nature of violence more generally *The National Crimes Record Bureau should seriously consider the possibility of maintaining disaggregated data on gender-based violence. Disability must be one of the variables on the basis of which such data must be maintained so that the scale of the problem can be mapped out and tailored remedial action can be taken *Police officers should be provided sensitization, on a regular basis, to deal with cases of sexual violence against women with disabilities, in an appropriate way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-protect-disabled-women-who-face-threat-of-violence/articleshow/82301535.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

On Wednesday, the state government announced that it has authorized the Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation, a body that procures drugs and equipment for all government hospitals, to place orders for 1.50 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccines to start the free vaccination drive for people above 18 from May 1. Sources, however, said that neither of the manufacturers — Bharat Biotech or Serum Institute of India — has so far offered to supply vaccines in bulk or in phases to the state government. While Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech has told TN that it can supply its first five lakh doses of Covaxin only by the third week of May, Serum Institute of India, which manufactures Covishield, has been silent on its supply schedule. There is also confusion over price difference between the two vaccines. “We don’t know at what price we could buy the vaccine,” a senior official said. According to the population registry, TN has 3.65 crore people in the 18-44 age group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-orders-1-5-crore-jabs-for-may-1-drive-no-clarity-on-price-supply-schedule/articleshow/82301538.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Holding Kumbh made Uttarakhand a laughing stock: High court||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court on Wednesday took to task the state government over the Covid-19 situation, saying that the state has become a laughing stock due to its organising the Kumbh Mela in the midst of a raging pandemic. The remarks came in the form of an oral observation from the bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma while it was hearing a bunch of PILs about the state's handling of the Covid-19 situation. The judges also questioned the decision of going ahead with the Char Dham Yatra which is slated to begin from next month onwards, saying that the prospect of conducting the pilgrimage in these times is “a frightening one”. The government meanwhile said that it would come out with the standard operating procedures for the yatra very soon. Increase number of crematoriums, court tells U’khandThe court also issued a series of directions after it was informed by counsels appearing for the petitioners about shortage of beds and oxygen which is causing panic among patients and their kin. Citing media reports which highlighted long queues for cremation, lack of firewood and overpricing by ambulances to carry patients and bodies, the court directed the state to increase the number of crematoriums by declaring certain areas as temporary cremation grounds and to ensure that there is no scarcity of wood. Further, the district magistrates (DM) were directed to check overpricing by ambulances and take strict action against the errant ambulance operators. “The court has directed the hospitals to strictly adhere to the SOPs for discharging of bodies of patients who were Covid-positive. The state has also been asked to consider employing dental surgeons in Covid care to supplement the MBBS doctors,” said Shiv Bhatt, counsel appearing for one of the petitioners.  The court further said that since people are required to register for the Covid vaccination online, and since there is a difficulty of connectivity in the hilly regions of the state, an alternate method of registration should be created. Secretary (health) Amit Negi who had earlier informed the court about the steps being taken by the state to tackle the pandemic, was directed to submit a report by May 7 with regard to the implementation of the directions issued by the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-holding-kumbh-made-uttarakhand-a-laughing-stock/articleshow/82301565.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Vijayawada||HC: Submit details of action taken against erring pvt hosps||Vijayawada: The AP high court on Wednesday directed the state government to file a memo with details about the action taken against private hospitals fleecing Covid-19 patients. The court also cautioned the government to be prepared for a worst-case scenario and not be under the impression that all is well. “We should not let our guard down till the situation becomes normal. Once complacency sets in, something worse will happen. We should learn from past experiences and prepare ourselves to tackle any kind of exigencies that may arise in the future,” chief justice Arup Kumar Goswami said after hearing two PILs on the prevailing Covid situation and fleecing by private hospitals in the state. The bench, also comprising Justice C Praveen Kumar, suggested various measures to be taken in the fight against the pandemic. It asked for testing to be ramped up further and the result time brought down to arrest the spread of the virus. The government should have projections about oxygen requirement, essential medicine supplies and number of beds required by taking worst-case scenario into account, the court said. Narra Srinivasa Rao, the petitioner’s counsel, told the bench that the situation on the ground remains grim, despite the state government issuing several guidelines. Private hospitals are collecting exorbitant amounts from patients and the nodal officers appointed by the government are turning a blind eye to the irregularities being committed, he alleged, adding that even essential medicines like Remdisivir and Tocilizumab are being sold at exorbitant prices. “Though the dashboard created by the government shows availability of beds, hospitals are denying admission unless the patients agree to pay the fee as per their treatment package. Many hospitals are not admitting patients having employee health insurance or other medical coverage from the government like Arogyasree,” he said. Explaining the measures taken by the government, advocate general S Sriram said that a slew of steps has been initiated to address the issues raised by the petitioners. There may have been some isolated incidents but as soon as it was brought to the notice of the authorities concerned, action was immediately being taken, he said. Special government pleader C Sumon and additional advocate general P Sudhakar Reddy explained to the bench about the dedicated 104 call centre, which was launched for dissemination of information as well as receiving complaints from patients. Nodal officers have been appointed for every Covid hospital to ensure that all norms are adhered to, they said. They further stated there is no short supply of oxygen in the state and the government is carefully regulating and coordinating the supply of essential drugs. The court asked them to submit details of the action taken against erring hospitals. “The directions of the government should not remain on paper, they should reflect in action. Submit details of flying squad visits to the hospitals and their observations,” the bench said. It further directed them to resolve the issue of non-response from nodal officers and display the names of the authorities concerned to be contacted to raise a complaint. It also suggested to increase the number of isolation facilities, especially for those unable to stay in home isolation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-submit-details-of-action-taken-against-erring-pvt-hosps/articleshow/82297633.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Vijayawada||KA Paul files PIL in HC to delay exams||Vijayawada: Global Peace Foundation and Prajashanti party founder KA Paul has moved the Andhra Pradesh high court with a public interest litigation petition seeking directions to the state government to postpone Class X to XII examinations by at least by two months in view of the Covid-19 situation. Paul argued in his petition that about 35 lakh students will be in danger of contracting the virus if the examinations were held amidst the pandemic. While students and teachers will face the direct threat of virus, their families, too, will be exposed, with a cumulative effect on 1.75 crore people. If the examinations are conducted before the Covid-19 situation subsides, they could become super spreader events and the multiplication of cases will be very high, he said. He argued that travelling to and from examination centres, discrimination between students living in red zones and green zones, social distancing, accommodation to the students at outside locations, health of guardians and the health of students with ailments like asthma are to be considered before conducting examination. The risk of infection is higher at the examination centres that are converted into isolation centres recently, he said. If one student is tested positive during the examination period, the centre has to be shut down and other students will be in fear of contracting the virus and they could not concentrate on examinations, he said. As other boards like CBSE and ICSE have already cancelled the examinations, the state government should also consider the same as the situation is no different in Andhra Pradesh, said Paul. As the representation given by him to the chief minister’s office elicited no response, Paul moved the high court for directions to postpone the examinations by at least two months if not cancelled. The high court is yet to hear the petition.

Narayan Dabhalkar had been taken to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation-run Indira Gandhi Rughnalaya on April 22 and was temporarily kept in the casualty ward when he noticed the woman beseeching doctors to give her husband a bed, his family said. “We had got a bed after great effort, but he was back home in a couple of hours,” Dabhalkar’s daughter Aasawari Kothiwan said. “He said, ‘I have already lived my life and would rather leave it to fate instead of blocking a bed at the cost of a younger patient’.” Narayan Dabhalkar told his family he didn’t want to block a bedHosp says bed can’t be given to specific person on request Kothiwan said doctors at the hospital tried hard to dissuade her father from going back home, citing his critical condition, but he insisted on taking discharge. A senior official of the hospital confirmed to TOI that the records mention Dabhalkar taking discharge against medical advice. The official, however, clarified that even if a patient voluntarily leaves, a bed cannot be given to any specific person on his request. “Whom to give the bed to is the prerogative of the doctors, although Dabhalkar’s leaving would have certainly eased the pressure by creating space for someone else.” Hospital sources said Dabhalkar left before he could be moved to the designated Covid ward from the casualty area. On Monday, a social media post went viral with the news that Dabhalkar, a retired Maharashtra government employee and an active member of the RSS, had “sacrificed a bed” for a young patient, much against his family and doctors’ advice. The deceased was also associated with the Shriram Shakha Pawan Bhumi. “Our entire family is down with Covid. On April 16, we got his samples tested and the results came on April 19. The treatment continued at home,” Dabhalkar’s daughter said. “His last moments were painful. His nails turned black and limbs became numb. He died after having a few morsels from my hand.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/85-yr-old-gives-up-bed-for-younger-man-dies/articleshow/82301573.cms||Shishir Arya

Neighbouring Tuticorin was not very different. The coastal district had 594 fresh cases, the fifth highest in the state, despite the fact that there were no major clusters there. A look at the state’s Covid data shows that semi-urban districts had witnessed massive spikes of Covid spread, more than urban districts. In the past 20 days, there was a 18% increase in total Covid cases in Chennai and Coimbatore, while semi-urban districts with smaller towns such as Tirunelveli, Tuticorin and Dharmapuri saw a 22% increase in the cases. In absolute numbers, Tuticorin reported only 193 new cases in the whole of March. But this month the district had 5,657 new cases by the 28th. Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri, Ramanathapuram, Tenkasi, Tiruvannamalai, Tirupattur and Ranipet have also recorded a massive surge in cases. On the other hand, rate of growth in Chennai and Coimbatore was less than in the semi-urban districts, though absolute numbers were far higher. Health officials say the surge could be because of the high number of election rallies held in semi-urban and rural areas of the state. These rallies saw people gathering in large numbers with no masks or social distancing. “There was zero compliance to Covid norms during these rallies,” said a health officer from a southern district. Besides there were large congregations during weddings and temple festivals in the small towns and villages. Yet another reason cited by officials was that several people from southern towns such as Tirunelveli and Tuticorin had relatives in high incidence states such as Maharashtra who travelled down during the election. These two districts also recorded Covid-19 positivity rate of around 13% on average in the past week, which is the highest in the state after Chennai. The districts are testing 2,000 to 2,500 samples a day. In industrial towns such as Tirupur, workplaces as well as packed workers quarters enabled faster transmission. While adherence to Covid norms improved as soon as cases started spiking in the second week of April in bigger cities, it took a lot more time and effort for the seriousness to trickle down to smaller towns. State health authorities say they have enough infrastructure to handle the surge. “People need not panic. Higher numbers are actually good since they indicate that our testing mechanism is effective and we are able trace, test and isolate more people,” said a health officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-covid-spike-steeper-in-semi-urban-areas/articleshow/82301569.cms||---

Sawant’s appeal to people not to panic did little to assuage people’s fears. Vegetables, eggs, bread, milk and other food items quickly flew off of shelves at some stores. Wariness about the government’s intentions and disbelief in Sawant’s assurance that the lockdown would not be extended was clear, as many people purchased sacks of wheat flour and rice sufficient for a month. People queued up outside Goa Sahakar Bhandar in the afternoon, sending social distancing norms for a toss as they attempted to complete their grocery shopping. “Less than an hour after the CM finished his speech, people suddenly turned up and started buying vegetables in big bags,” said Raju, a vegetable vendor in Panaji. A large number of people were seen queuing up at supermarkets at grocery shops to stock up on essentials. People were also seen stocking up on alcohol, cold drinks and instant noodles. In the Pimpalkatta area, the commercial hub of Margao, people were seen crowding despite the authorities having put in place restrictions on shopkeepers of the two municipal markets located in the vicinity. In his address, Sawant made it clear that essential services such as grocery stores would continue to be open and that nobody would be prevented from stepping out to purchase food items or pick up food from restaurants. “Till yesterday, the chief minister kept saying that there is no lockdown. Today, he says there is a lockdown for three days. Maharashtra has extended its lockdown. What guarantee do we have that Goa will not do the same,” said Maheswari Gupta, a resident at Old Goa. Similar scenes unfolded in most towns of South Goa, including at Curchorem and Quepem. People were sceptical about the period of the lockdown. “We were caught off-guard last year when the lockdown was announced, as they kept on extending the lockdown. I am wiser this time,” said a customer. In order to avoid crowding and enforce social distancing, some superstores limited the number of people allowed to enter. “I had come for my usual shopping as any other day. But going by the large number of people here, it looks like panic buying has set in,” a customer at a superstore in Arlem said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/groceries-fly-off-shelves-even-as-cm-urges-citizens-not-to-panic-buy/articleshow/82299826.cms||---

He said there was a need to bolster the state government’s revenue through legal mining activities. He asked the officials to impose hefty penalties on illegal miners.  Peddireddy and finance minister Buggana Rajendranath reviewed revenue performance of the mines and geology department with senior officials here on Wednesday. Peddireddy said the government has set a revenue target of Rs 4,000 crore in the current fiscal. He asked the officials to strengthen vigilance in all districts to check illegal mining. Speaking to the media, Peddireddy said the department achieved 81 per cent of the target during the last fiscal despite the Covid-19 crisis. He said all clearances for mining activity should be granted through a single desk system. “We have imposed penalties to the tune of Rs 42.66 crore in 10,736 cases for illegal mining. We have asked the officials not to spare anyone involved in illegal mining activity,” said Peddireddy. He said they fetched Rs 2,917 crore revenue through the mines department during the last fiscal which is nearly 81 per cent of their target. He said skilled labour went back to their native states due to Covid-19 last year resulting in decrease in revenue. He asked the officials to ensure that workers would not leave mining towns and work places in the next few months as it would hit work in factories. “Take all possible measure with the help of managements of mining factories and quarries to provide better working environment to skilled workers as the production and revenue would be hit if they leave work places,” said Peddireddy. Venkata Reddy, director, Mines and Geology (DMG), said they were adopting a three-pronged strategy to improve revenue. He said they were collecting seigniorage on granite on weight basis instead of value metric basis which helped them get additional revenue of Rs 425 crore. He said that collection of seigniorage through third party inspections had helped garner another Rs 205crore. He said that they have collected additional royalty of Rs 24 crore. The system has been introduced on pilot basis in Srikakulam, Chittoor, Prakasam and Ananthapuram. He said that the new system would help them achieve at least Rs 4,345 crore revenue in the current fiscal if successfully implemented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/minister-calls-for-crackdown-on-illegal-mining-activities-in-state/articleshow/82297711.cms||Samdani MN

According to Governorpet police, the incident could have happened a couple of days ago and came to light on Tuesday after the shop owners realised that around two boxes of gold jewellery were missing. Upon receiving information, cops reached the spot and examined the scene with a clues team. Cops suspect that the shop clerk Harsha, a resident of Krishna Lanka area, could have stolen the jewellery. Harsha, who was hired around a year ago, has not turned up for work over the last two days and hasn’t picked up his phone either. Cops sent two teams to find Harsha at his residence and other places. Cops said that they are gathering CCTV evidence from the shop and surrounding areas to track the accused and are also looking into other gold jewellery assets to check if anymore gold jewellery is stolen. A case has been registered at Governorpet police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/rs-3-crore-worth-gold-stolen-from-jewellery-store/articleshow/82297747.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Deen Dayal Swastha Seva Yojana to cover 80% Covid treatment costs at pvt hosps||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Wednesday announced that cover under the state medical insurance scheme, Deen Dayal Swastha Seva Yojana (DDSSY), will now also be provided for Covid-19 treatment at private hospitals. He said 70-80% of the cost will be borne by the state under DDSSY, a move that is expected to alleviate the massive burden on government facilities that are involved in Covid-19 treatment. He also urged more private hospitals to come forward to provide treatment for the viral infection and said that Covid-19 test results would be received within 24 hours from Friday onwards as all backlog would be cleared by Thursday. “There is an increasing burden on government doctors. We are telling private hospitals to increase their bed capacities. We are now providing Covid-19 treatment under the DDSSY card. If any hospitals are not part of DDSSY, they should join. We have taken the decision after considering the burden on government hospitals. As much as 70-80% of treatment costs will be covered under DDSSY,” said Sawant. He said patients would have to pay only a small fraction of the bill from their own pockets. Four renowned private pulmonologists and chest physicians from Margao have come forward to offer their services voluntarily at the government hospitals, the chief minister said, even as her urged members of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) and other doctors to come on board. Sawant appealed to symptomatic people to start the medication course announced by the state government as part of the protocol for home isolation even before they receive their test results. “If you follow this protocol, you can avoid hospitalisation. As per the SOP declared, you can start your own treatment,” he said, while also advising those with severe symptoms not to stay at home for fear of hospitalisation. As many as 90-93 patients are presently on ventilator at the Goa Medical College (GMC), Bambolim, and at least four Covid-19 deaths each day occur within just 24 hours of the patient being hospitalised, the chief minister said and added that there are at least two cases everyday of patients being brought dead. “There is no shortage of oxygen in Goa. Eleven metric tonne has been approved for the state already. We are set to get another 20 metric tonne from the Centre,” Sawant said. “There are four plants in Goa. Of these, Vedanta has started providing supply free of cost. Through the PMO’s intervention, we are getting additional supply.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ddssy-to-cover-80-covid-treatment-costs-at-pvt-hosps/articleshow/82299844.cms||---

The deceased were identified as Lakshmaiah (70) and his wife Bhagyamma (68). According to Amruthaluru police, the incident happened during the early hours when both of them were asleep. Police said that they are yet to ascertain the cause of fire but suspect that an electrical short circuit could be the main reason. Cops said that the couple’s shanty tenement was getting unauthorised electricity from an electric pole adjacent to the house. Fire tenders reached the spot and doused the flames. But by then, both had succumbed to severe burn injuries. A pall of gloom descended the village after their children returned to the place to find their parents dead. Cops registered a case under section 174 of CrPC (unnatural death) at Amruthaluru police station. Both the bodies have been sent to Tenali government hospital for post-mortem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/house-on-fire-elderly-couple-dies-of-burns/articleshow/82297772.cms||---

---||Goa||North Goa hosp being readied to treat Covid cases||Panaji: The process to turn the North Goa district hospital into a Covid hospital has commenced. All non-Covid patients have been either discharged or asked to go to Goa Medical College (GMC). Except for one or two, most of the hospital’s departments that catered to non-Covid patients were shut on Wednesday as it prepared to open totally for Covid admissions. A notification declaring it a Covid hospital was yet to be issued. “Patients were given the option of either going home or to GMC. Obviously, patients preferred to go home rather than get infected with Covid-19. Most of the departments have been shut after the patients were discharged,” a hospital staffer said. Two days ago, health minister Vishwajit Rane announced that they were planning to turn the North Goa district hospital into a full-fledged Covid hospital. Only one ward of the hospital was being used for isolating Covid patients. The hospital with 250 beds caters to patients from Bardez, Pernem and Sattari talukas. With the state health infrastructure crumbling under the weight of the ever increasing patient load, the government has been exploring all options to increase beds for Covid patients, a health official said. Till Tuesday, the labour and anti-natal rooms were operational, but the authorities were looking to shut them, too. “Where would women who delivered just a day before go, and that too at night,” he said. The immediate consequence of this arrangement, however, is being felt by the poor and needy non-Covid patients that rely on this hospital. “Out-patient departments (OPD) may be kept open for a half-day, but patients will be exposed to the risk of Covid infection once it is turned into a Covid hospital. I don’t know what the final arrangement is,” the staffer said. Medical superintendent Mohan Pednekar did not respond to multiple calls nor did he reply to the message sent to him on his Whatsapp number asking if non-Covid OPDs will be functional after the hospital is declared a Covid hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/north-goa-hosp-being-readied-to-treat-covid-cases/articleshow/82299964.cms||---

Keshav Bhajanka, executive director of the company, told TOI: “Our indigenously developed firewall technology has the potential to save lives and minimise damage of furniture by containing the spread of fire and toxic gas. We are not taking any additional cost for this technology. However, there is a substantial raw material cost that has been incurred in implementing the technology across all our products.” The company has not joined hands with any entity for the introduction of the technology. Bhajanka sounded confident that the present scenario in plywood business is positive and the recovery of demand in the post-lockdown phase has been far faster than what was anticipated. “We are extremely bullish on plywood and other building materials. We have some big plans for the eastern India and a couple of projects is being considered for Bengal. Now, all future plans are under discussion,” he said. Currently, the company’s several new business plans are in the pipeline for Bengal and some projects are still under discussion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/centuryply-unveils-fire-proof-tech-across-products/articleshow/82298983.cms||Sarthak.G

All slots for the opening day were taken up almost as soon as registrations opened on Wednesday evening, initial CoWin glitches notwithstanding. “We had 77,000 slots for May 1. Registration opened in the evening and it was all filled in a couple of hours. Around 4,000 of those who registered are from Indore, and 2,500 for Bhopal. They will be vaccinated on May 1,” National Health Mission state director Chhavi Bhardwaj told TOI. Sources said the state government has ordered 45 lakh doses of Covishield for the opening phase of the vaccination of 18-44-year-olds in May. However, none of these supplies have arrived so far. Owing to the low availability of vaccines, only 77,000 slots were opened for the 18-44 age group on May 1, said sources, adding that the slots for Indore and Bhopal were filled up in less than an hour. Minor technical glitches were observed during the registration on the CoWin portal and Aaroyga Setu app. Sources said initially there was difficulty in getting OTPs and fewer vac centres showed up when you input pin-codes. The government has stopped the ongoing vaccination of 60-plus and 45-plus population on April 29 and April 30 to prepare for the vaccination of 18-44 campaign. The plan is to shift vaccination centres outside of hospitals so that people do not have any hesitation. On May 1, vaccination for the other two groups will resume even as the mega campaign kicks off. Two separate teams will handle vaccinations in the 18-44 and 45-plus categories.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/77000-sign-up-in-madhya-pradesh-for-vaccination-on-may-1-all-slots-filled-in-a-jiffy/articleshow/82301594.cms||---

The Union government had announced that from May 1, every citizen above 18 years of age can get vaccinated and announced that registration for the same will begin at 4pm on Wednesday in the Co-Win app, portal. However, within minutes of the registration beginning, several users complained of the app either crashing down or taking too much time to process. The situation was the same across the country. To sign up for the vaccination, one has to first register themselves on the portal/app and then proceed to schedule a slot for vaccination. On Wednesday, while some managed to complete registration in a click, several had to wait for hours to complete the registration itself. “I got through the registration after what seemed like forever. But, then the portal showed that vaccination cannot be scheduled for anyone less than 45 years in any of the hospitals in Chennai,” said K Pramodh, 29, a resident of Kodambakkam. Across the city, users complained of being unable to schedule vaccination. Several users even complained that getting the OTP (one time password) for registration was a tough task. “Vaccination appointments for 18 plus will be possible once the State Governments and Private Vaccination Centers schedule Vaccination sessions. Registration is happening on http://cowin.gov.in,”read a tweet from official handle of Aarogya Setu, Gvernment of India's mobile application for contact tracing & dissemination of medical advisories to contain spread of Covid-19. The state government, meanwhile, announced on Wednesday that it has ordered 1.5 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses to be made available for the inoculation drive from May 1. As on April 27, 55.51 lakh people across the state have been vaccinated and efforts are being intensified to administer jabs for people aged 45 years and above, the state said. In Chennai, as on April 27, a total of 13.97 lakh people have been vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-co-win-glitches-mar-vax-sign-up-of-people-18/articleshow/82301597.cms||---

The archbishop appealed to the people to join the rest of the faithful in India in observing May 7 as a day of special prayer and penance for relief from the Covid-19 pandemic. “While we join the Church in India in observing that special day, I would also propose that we spend May 13, the day of Our Lady of Fatima, as a special day of prayer and fasting in our archdiocese. On that day I would like to appeal particularly to our priests and religious to spend at least one hour before the Blessed Sacrament, praying earnestly for this intention. I have requested the Diocesan Family Service Centre to send some aids for the family rosary, to be used on that day,” Ferrao said. In view of meeting the crisis situation, the archbishop said “our priests have been instructed to take appropriate decisions for the good of their flock”. Ferrao added that “most parishes have adopted suitable plans in this direction”. The archbishop also appreciated the work of the “real heroes” - the doctors, nurses, frontline workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/observe-may-7-as-day-of-prayer-for-relief-from-covid/articleshow/82300008.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

This time, vaccination will be held outside of hospitals to reduce hesitancy, and these two days will be used to make alternate arrangements and train vac staff, said sources. There has been a sharp dip in vaccination in the past couple of weeks as people are scared of contracting the infection if they go to vaccination centres in hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/vaccination-drive-in-madhya-pradesh-stopped-for-two-days/articleshow/82301599.cms||---

The block is being converted into a Covid-19 hospital and is likely to be commissioned in the first week of May. “I have instructed the respective departments and agencies to roll up their sleeves and ensure timely commissioning of the block that will cater only to Covid-19 patients,” Rane said. He discussed the preparedness for commissioning 150 intensive care unit (ICU) beds in the superspeciality block which will be in addition to the existing 400-plus Covid-19 beds at the GMC. Hospital admissions of Covid-19 patients have more than doubled over the past week and the GMC itself sees an average of 60-70 admissions per day. Several patients have to be accommodated either on trolleys or wheelchairs for lack of beds even as the state’s premier hospital opens a new ward everyday for Covid-19 patients. Bandekar said patients on trolleys are shifted to beds or taken to other Covid-19 hospitals as soon as beds become available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/commission-superspecialty-block-on-time-demands-rane/articleshow/82300089.cms||---

While the prices of packed mustard oil has increased by Rs 6 per litre across Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, it has increased by Rs 24 per litre or 16% during this period in Kolkata. Many cities and states have imposed weekend lockdowns or curfews in the past one month including Maharashtra, Delhi and Karnataka to tackle the surge in Covid cases. The consumer affairs ministry has alerted the states to ensure that the prices of essential commodities don’t increase artificially during the lockdown. According to the data available on the price monitoring portal of the ministry, the prices of tur or arhar dal per kg has increased by Rs 5, Rs 9, Rs 5 and Rs 2 in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai respectively in the past one month.

Covid isn’t new to her; she served during the first wave last year, too. But this time she feels things are different. “It’s so depressing to see young people falling sick and deteriorating.” Just like her, the other staff members are not expecting things to ease out anytime soon. They are expecting Covid duty hours to go beyond the six hours that they put in last year. “We managed six hours of duty with mutual understanding but now probably, we will have to work for 12 hours. I don’t know how we will manage such long hours in PPE suits,” she said, adding that the hospital has told them they will not be granted leave even if a family member falls sick. Considering the risk involved, some nurses have decided to hire accommodation close to the hospital and stay together. “We want our families to be safe,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/im-scared-says-nurse-at-covid-facility/articleshow/82300132.cms||---

Tocilizumab, manufactured by Roche, is imported and distributed by Cipla in India. In a joint letter to states, the department of pharma and health ministry said the drug went out of stock a few weeks ago due to a sudden surge in its demand. “Fresh limited stock of the drug has now been imported and is available with the lone marketer company Cipla Ltd. for marketing and distribution,” the letter said. While the Centre has made interim allocation of this drug among states, the allocated stocks will be distributed further to government and private hospitals by respective state governments. No separate allocation is being sent to private hospitals, the letter added. The Centre also advised states to ensure that these limited stocks are used judiciously and strictly as per the standard treatment protocol issued by the joint monitoring group of health ministry. “The allocation is interim and would be reviewed shortly,” the government said. Meanwhile, Roche Pharma is working with local health authorities to accelerate an emergency use authorisation (EUA) for its investigational antibody cocktail Casirivimab and Imdevimab in India (based on the data that have been filed for the EUA in the US and the EU). “An EUA in India would enable the import of globally manufactured product batches as soon as possible,” the company said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tocilizumab-stocks-have-arrived-govt/articleshow/82301606.cms||Sushmi Dey

The Rims hospital management said they are looking into the issue to take up appropriate action. According to Sudhir Kumar, his father-in-law Sadhu Saran Thakur and mother-in-law were admitted to Rims on April 15 for the treatment of Covid-19 infection. Thakur, who was attended by Dr C B Sharma, died the following day because of pneumonia. After Thakur's death, the Rims officials told Kumar that it would take at least two days to release the body and the deputy commissioner's office would call him. Kumar alleged, "Since my mother-in-law is also serious, I got involved in her treatment. However, when I approached Rims to get the body after two days, the Rims authority sent me to one counter to another but to no avail." He further said the Rims register showed no signature of any recipient against his father-in-law's name. Kumar added that since several other members of his family are also infected, he is engaged in looking after them and could not find time to approach the police.

---||Kolkata||EC: Covid -ve report, vax must for candidates & counting agents||KOLKATA: The Election Commission on Wednesday issued a lengthy Covid advisory to be strictly followed in the run-up to and on May 2, when counting of votes is scheduled in Bengal, and called for a state-level comprehensive plan. Any polling agent or candidate who is symptomatic, doesn’t have a negative RT-PCR test report and hasn’t taken both doses of vaccine must not be allowed into counting halls, the chief electoral officer has been told. District electoral officers (DEOs) have been asked to arrange Covid tests for candidates and counting agents a day in advance. The EC also wants a counting agent in PPE to be seated between every two counting agents. Elaborating on the time frame, the poll panel guidelines say that the list of counting agents must be submitted to returning officers three days prior to May 2. Also, candidates and agents must produce their “negative RT-PCR or RAT report” and vaccination certificate within 48 hours of the start of counting. Trinamool Congress’ Rajya Sabha MP Derek O’Brien has sought a clarification from the EC on how a negative report submitted on May 4 would help the situation. He has also pointed out that a counting agent may test positive after 5pm on April 29, the deadline issued by EC to submit a list to returning officers. The advisory reiterates that no victory procession will be allowed on May 2 while not more than two persons can accompany the winner as he or she receives the MLA certificate. Those violating Covid safety norms will be prosecuted under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant) of the IPC, it said. On counting hall protocol, the guidelines recommend a big enough area to maintain physical distancing, proper ventilation with adequate number of windows and exhaust fans and a thorough disinfection drive before, during and after counting, which means “even EVMs must be sanitised”. The EC has appointed DEOs as nodal officers for counting centres. “The DEO must obtain a compliance certificate from the health officer concerned. Counting of votes in a constituency may be done in three to four halls by appointing additional assistant returning officers,” the advisory said, adding that counting agents must be replaced in case of Covid-positive reports. Thermal scanning and availability of soaps/sanitisers, face shields and gloves are mandatory at the entrance of counting centres. A list of dos and don’ts will have to be displayed at the entrance too. The advisory also directed “proper disposal” of used masks, face shields, PPE kits and gloves. Seating arrangements for counting personnel and agents must follow NDMA or SDMA guidelines. “For counting of postal ballots, an additional number of AROs may be deputed,” EC order said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ec-covid-ve-report-vax-must-for-candidates-counting-agents/articleshow/82300305.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Preventive detentions biased, Trinamool writes to EC||Kolkata: The Trinamool Congress on Wednesday complained to the Election Commission against anticipated detention of party workers ahead of polling in Birbhum in the final phase on April 29. A letter by advocate Sanjay Basu, on behalf of the party, stated that EC officials had decided on preventive detention of “trouble-mongers” under Section 151 of CrPC and the same was an attempt to “arbitrarily detain people having affinity to AITC”. “In the past, it has been seen that people who are illegally detained are neither charged with any offence nor are they handed over any memo of arrest. On the other hand, members/supporters of the BJP who are repeat offenders and have been accused of election-related crimes are not detained despite numerous complaints filed with the EC,” Basu wrote. The letter also argues that detaining Trinamool workers is an attempt to prevent them “from exercising their franchise and election duties, which is a violation of their fundamental rights”. It asks why such “stringent steps” are being taken without valid reason. The letter further questions why a police officer earlier reprimanded by the EC for slapping a shopkeeper during the 2016 assembly polls had been appointed as an SP. “Such action is akin to a state of emergency being declared, merely to suit the political interests of the BJP,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/preventive-detentions-biased-trinamool-writes-to-ec/articleshow/82300394.cms||---

This is the most effective way to break the chain of infection, he told officials at a review meeting. Janata curfew has started giving positive results, the CM said. The state has moved from No. 7 in the country to No.11 in active cases, but it’s time for extreme caution as the Covid virus can quickly change strain, he warned. Oxygen supply has increased five-fold in just three weeks this month — from 130 MT on April 8 to 540 MT on April 28. About 29% isolation beds and 58% oxygen beds are occupied.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-corona-curfew-to-be-enforced-strictly-till-may-7-says-chief-minister/articleshow/82301611.cms||---

After the onset of the pandemic last year, the court had excluded the period from March 15 last year till March 14 this year from being taken into account for computing the period of limitation. Various statutes provide between 30 to 90 days’ period for filing of appeal or completing certain statutory tasks. A bench of CJI N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and A S Bopanna took note of suggestions from attorney general K K Venugopal, solicitor general Tushar Mehta and SC advocates-on-record association president Shivaji Jadhav and used its inherent powers under Articles141 and142 of the Constitution to order indefinite extension of limitation period for all matters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-extends-deadline-for-filing-appeals/articleshow/82301619.cms||---
---||India||Shift Kappan to a Delhi hospital: SC||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed the UP government to shift journalist Siddique Kappan, arrested and in custody since October 5 for alleged links with PFI and accused of going to Hathras purportedly for creating disharmony in the aftermath of death of the gangrape victim, from Mathura jail to to a Delhi hospital in Delhi for treatment. This direction met with strong disapproval and resistance from UP government, which through solicitor general Tushar Mehta said all hospitals in Delhi are brimming with Covid patients and admitting Kappan, a 42-year non-Covid inmate accused under Unlawful Activities Act (UAPA), to a Delhi hospital would result in asking a Covid patient, who could be a senior citizen, to vacate his bed. "I cannot request tany hospital to do such a thing," the SG said. A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and A S Bopanna ordered shifting of Kappan from Mathura jail to a Delhi hospital for treatment after advocate Wills Mathews, appearing for Kerala Union of Working Journalists and Kappan's wife, told the court that the accused was in a serious health condition with severe diabetics and that he had been in jail for the last more than six months. The CJI-led bench disposed of the writ petition filed by the Union and said Kappan would be taken back to Mathur Jail after doctors certify him fit for the purpose. "Kappan would be free to take recourse to procedures established under law to seek bail from a competent court after he is treated and sent back to jail," the bench said. The SG said that the UP government is responsible for the health of not only Kappan but all inmates of Mathura prison, many of whom are Covid patients with or without co-morbidities. When he wondered loudly whether all of the inmates should be admitted to a hospital in Delhi, the bench said, "We are only considering Kappan's case on humanitarian grounds and giving him proper treatment would be in the interest of the state government also." When the bench did not heed to UP government's request to subject Kappan to a medical board and give him treatment at Mathura hospital or outside as suggested by doctors, the solicitor general asked what was so special about Kappan that he could not be treated at any of the hospitals in Mathura? "Thousands of honest taxpayers and law abiding citizens are being treated in the hospitals of Mathura. We should not forget that we are dealing with a 42-year-old non-Covid inmate who is facing serious charges under UAPA. In Mathura there are several Covid positive senior citizens who are finding it difficult to get a bed in a hospital because of the sudden surge in the Covid cases. Should they also be sent to Delhi? The journalist association does not even seek his shifting to Delhi for treatment. Why should the SC so direct," the SG asked. When the CJI-led bench remained firm on admitting Kappan to RML Hospital or any government hospital in Delhi, the SG said, "The court has to direct the hospital to vacate a bed to accommodate Kappan as more serious covid patients with comorbidities ae not getting a bed in the Delhi hospitals already full with patients. Some Covid positive patient would have to be moved out of the hospital as no bed is available in any of the government hospitals." The bench told the SG to request any of the hospitals to arrange a bed for Kappan. The SG said,"I cannot request as it would lead to depriving a more deserving patient a bed. The SC can direct." The bench said "leave it there".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/shift-kappan-to-a-delhi-hospital-sc/articleshow/82301622.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Kolkata||Teacher caught abusing students, IIT-Kgp says won't stand such conduct||KHARAGPUR: A member of IIT-Kharagpur’s faculty of humanities and social sciences has been caught on camera abusing her students during an online class, but the premier institute had not set up an inquiry till the filing of this report on Wednesday. The faculty member was teaching English to SC/ST students as part of a preparatory course and became abusive when they did not stand up for the national anthem. Some of her expletives were also directed at the parents of her students. Recordings of the lecture were put up on social media and forwarded beyond campus. Initially, it was said that a review/inquiry had been instituted to investigate what had happened. However, registrar Tamal Nath denied the same on Wednesday evening. “The complaint has reached the director and such behaviour is definitely not supported. Appropriate action will be taken if necessary. No inquiry committee has been set up,” he added. A senior teacher of the institute said students who had attended the class “seemed shaken by such behaviour”. He said students who had brought forward the matter had been assured that their identities would be protected and that the higher authorities were looking into the complaint. “It is unfortunate. Such behaviour is not expected from a teaching faculty. She has been previously accused of being extremely strict, but we have not come across any incident when she has been verbally abusive to students before,” said another faculty member. The department holds these preparatory classes for SC/ST students every year. “Those who attended the online class have given us details of what had happened. You can clearly hear how many times she hurls abuses at her students. She keeps shouting at them throughout,” said a senior student, adding that they were waiting for the director to take action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/teacher-caught-abusing-students-iit-kgp-says-wont-stand-such-conduct/articleshow/82300324.cms||Sujoy Khanra

This is the highest single-day cure count. All four major hotspots in MP — Bhopal, Indore, Jabalpur and Gwalior — had more recoveries (6,507) than new cases (5,483). Wednesday was also the first day this month when the active load dropped — a dip of 1,500 but a hope-inspiring one. The positivity rate also dipped by 1% over 24 hours to touch 22.6%. However, the cheer was dampened by the fact that it was the day of most deaths as well — 105. Nearly 30% of the fatalities were in the big four districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/recoveries-outnumber-new-covid-cases-in-madhya-pradesh/articleshow/82301630.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Anubrata gives tailing team the slip, traced to Tarapith||Kolkata: Trinamool Congress’ Birbhum chief Anubrata Mondal did what he has done twice before — he made a local magistrate, eight paramilitary personnel and a videographer, who were supposed to tail him 24x7, chase thin air as his car sped away from a traffic crossing within the borders of rural Bolpur. He was traced to Tarapith temple almost three hours later, with the Election Commission directing the district administration to send a second notice to him reminding him that he cannot, “under no circumstances”, escape the surveillance. The district Trinamool chief has now been asked to inform the magistrate of his every move before stepping out. Many were reminded of scenes from 2016 when he rode a bike pillion, throwing the surveillance team in disarray on election day. The police report stated that Mondal’s car was ahead of the traffic signal and hence managed to move ahead, and that he had not done anything that showed his act was deliberate. Mondal, his close aides said, had a habit of travelling across the district a day before elections when he met his partymen and took stock of the situation. He usually sits at the party office, 400m from his home in Bolpur, after casting his vote on polling day. Sources said that in the few hours he managed to dodge the surveillance team — until police teams were alerted about his movement and he was traced to the temple town — he was busy with “election work”. “He visited Nanoor, Labhpur, Illambazar and Mallarpur and had a word with locals from inside his vehicle. He did not come out of his SUV,” a local aide claimed. Mondal neither denied nor confirmed the claims. “I will call Didi at night to report to her about the ground situation,” he said after returning to Bolpur later in the day. The EC had on Tuesday asked the Bengal chief electoral officer to put Mondal under “strict surveillance” of the executive magistrate and Central Armed Police Forces, starting from 5pm on April 27 till 7am on April 30, to ensure conduct of free and fair polls.

---||Kolkata||District seats in final phase will seal fates of veterans||KOLKTA: Seven assembly seats in north and central Kolkata along with 28 others spread over Malda, Murshidabad and Birbhum — a total 35 assembly seats — are going to polls in the eighth and final phase of Bengal elections that have turned into a medico-political battle by now. This phase is packed with a number of quick sand pits, particularly in Congress belts of Murshidabad and Malda, that might seal the fates of political veterans. The signs were there in the depleting vote share of Congress in five of the seven assembly seats under Behrampore parliamentary constituency in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Congress was found trailing in Burwan, Bharatpur, Beldanga, Nowda and Rejinagar seats that have a heavy Muslim presence. Trinamool leaders hope to gain from this trend because they feel BJP’s majoritarian approach would further push the minorities towards Mamata Banerjee. As an equal and opposite reaction, this could lead to a counter-consolidation of Hindus that might increase BJP’s vote share in Murshidabad, particularly in Behrampore and Kandi, where Hindus are a majority. However, the simple polarization might not work at Domkal, where the Left matters still. CPM is also a factor in Nowda. The Left suffered erosion at Jalangi after some CPM leaders switched sides. In Bharatpur, Congress would be facing a three-pronged contest — Trinamool, BJP and AIMIM. Like in Murshidabad, Congress for the first time is facing a tough challenge from Trinamool in Mothabari and Sujapur where Muslim population is 70% and 90% respectively. The BJP is better placed in Malda and Englishbazar while the party might lose a chance in the Manikchak seat due to inner squabbles. The BJP won Baishnabnagar seat located near the Indo-Bangladesh border in 2016. The party this time struggles to hold on to the seat because the ruling Trinamool has targeted Chain Mandal community that plays a role in determining fates of candidates. Birbhum is one district in Bengal where signs of dissent against Trinamool came out in the open way back in 2014. Yet, BJP couldn’t reach its expectation on this Anubrata Mandal turf for all these years. And this, after the Trinamool district president was put under house arrest during polls in Birbhum. Mandal was summoned by CBI on Tuesday but he intimated that he couldn’t make it to the CBI office because of health reasons. Birbhum has a record of all zilla parishad seats being won uncontested in the 2018 rural polls. Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh and Union ministers campaigned intensively in this district to bring a change in its political map. BJP leaders are banking on Mayureswar, Sainthia and Dubrajpur while Trinamool is confident about Nalhati, Murari and Rampurhat. BJP heavyweight Anirban Ganguly has locked horns with Trinamool’s outgoing minister Chandranath Sinha in Bolpur. Ganguly, despite his suave image and the general anti-incumbency, is at odds with the resentment among Bolpur residents over the role of Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty. Labhpur, Suri and Hasan assembly seats are headed for a tough contest. Sharing its borders with Jharkhand, Birbhum is home to legal and illegal stone mining, sand mining and coal smuggling where mafias make and unmake politicians.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/district-seats-in-final-phase-will-seal-fates-of-veterans/articleshow/82300473.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Plasma black market ring busted in Gwalior||BHOPAL: At least five medical practitioners are under the scanner of Gwalior police after a ward boy and an auto driver were arrested for allegedly stealing and selling plasma units in the black. Hitika Vasal, a 2017 batch IPS officer, is investigating the plasma ring after intelligence inputs from SP Amit Sanghi. “We have arrested two suspects and some others are being interrogated. The autorickshaw driver, who was operating from inside Jaya Arogya Hospital, used to scout for customers and pass on the information to the ward boy and some blood bank employees. They sold the plasma for around Rs 20,000,” Vasal, who is posted as ASP of Jhansi Road police station, told TOI. Police had sent a decoy to the autowallah, who fell into the trap and promised to get the plasma for Rs 20,000. He took the plainclothesman to the insider, who asked the ‘customer’ to arrange for a doctor’s slip. After sending the slip, the decoy was told to rendezvous near a temple to collect the plasma. As soon as the person came to deliver the plasma, he was arrested. “Plasma was not for sale. They were simply stealing it from the JAH blood bank and selling it off. They have confessed to selling plasma to around 10 people, but we think there are more. We are trying to trace them as well. The slips issued by doctors and names of patients were found to be fake,” said ASP Vasal. We will take our investigation to the hospitals where these plasma units were used,” said ASP Vasal. Police said the gang was not even selling the correct plasma. The decoy customer had asked for ‘O’ blood group, and the unit given to him was of ‘AB +’, the officer added. A case has been registered under various sections including Epidemic Diseases Act. Earlier, Gwalior police had arrested four people for selling substandard plasma, which had claimed the life of a Covid-19 patient. The accused were arrested under IPC 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder).

---||Delhi||LG is now govt in Delhi; AAP says didn’t expect this during pandemic||NEW DELHI: The Government of NCT of Delhi (Amendment) Act, notified by the Centre on Tuesday, significantly changes the functioning of the government in Delhi that’s reeling under a Covid apocalypse and mounting deaths. It withdraws powers from the elected government and bestows them upon the Centre-appointed lieutenant governor. Now, the elected AAP government needs the approval of the LG before taking any executive action under any law because the amendment makes it clear that the LG is now the “government”. TimesViewAny major change in an administrative structure entails some teething troubles. The important thing is to ensure that the shift in this case doesn’t hamper or delay Covid work. In this crisis in the national capital, the administrative machinery cannot fail thousands of patients and their relatives.Amid the pandemic, the development may make decision-making a longer process because all files related to executive action will be sent to the LG for approval. The LG has called a Covid management meeting on Thursday. “The expression ‘government’ referred to in any law to be made by the legislative assembly shall mean lieutenant governor,” the notification issued by the Union ministry of law and justice on March 28 stated after the President gave his assent to the amendment. ‘LG as govt’ could hit pandemic fight: AAPThe notification added: “…before taking any executive action in pursuance of the decision of the council of ministers, to exercise power of government…under any law in force in the Capital, the opinion of the lieutenant governor in term of proviso to clause (4) of article 293AA of the Constitution shall be obtained on all such matters as specified, by a general or special order, by the lieutenant governor.” While the state government maintained a discreet silence, AAP said in a statement that the notification of the amendment right in the middle of the second wave can prove to be disruptive. “We really hoped the central government would wait at least till the end of the second wave. Delhi is amidst a Covid-19 crisis and notifying this right in the middle of the second wave can lead to a lot of chaos,” AAP said in a statement. “This could definitely adversely affect Covid management in the national capital. Under the leadership of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, we are working on every possible aspect to tackle the second wave. The central government and the Delhi government are working together. But such a notification will bring a lot of confusion, and when work is going on on a war footing, the last thing people expect is chaos and confusion among the administrations.” However, a Delhi government official said the amendment was unlikely to affect Covid management because LG is the chairperson of Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) and all DDMA decisions are always taken with the approval of the chairperson. Many powers, including financial powers in the state administration, have already been delegated to the head of the departments, secretary and authorities beyond. “The amendment does not change the delegation of power among the authorities and they will continue to be empowered to take decisions within their jurisdiction, like repair of roads, etc.,” said an official. According to sources, the administrative decisions of the elected government of Delhi, however, may not be implemented as fast as earlier because the files will be sent to the LG for his nod. The decisions can be implemented only after his approval. The LG’s office already has a mechanism in place and no files are delayed, claimed another source. “Special focus is given on urgent files and they are disposed of on priority,” said the source. The amendment may trigger a major confrontation between the elected government and the Centre. The leader of the opposition, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, and Delhi BJP have already urged the LG to reject the proposed amendment to Delhi’s excise policy approved by the Delhi cabinet and scrap the proposed doorstep delivery of ration. The amendment also seeks to ensure that the business in assembly is conducted in accordance with Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha. This provision will put an end to any scope for criticising any leader or person who is not member of the house. In the past, there have been several instances where names of top central government ministers were taken in the Delhi assembly. There is ambiguity about the impact of the amendment on the Delhi assembly and its committees. The amendment states that “…the legislative assembly shall not make any rule to enable itself or its committees to consider the matters of day-to-day administration of the capital or conduct inquiries in relation to the administrative decisions.” It also stated that any of the rules made in contravention of this proviso, before the commencement of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2021, shall be void. “It is also not clearly defined as what topics and issues fall under the term ‘dayto-day administration of the capital’ used in the amendment,” said a source, adding that it was a very vague term. “An officer who is summoned by the assembly’s committees may say that the issue for which they are being summoned falls under the ‘day-today administration’ and thus is beyond the purview of the committees according to the amendment. The departments may also make similar excuses upon being summoned by the committees.” The source claimed that the speaker is the final authority when it comes to interpretation of the rules of procedure. “In case of difference of opinion, the speaker will be the final authority and anyone going against his decision may invite privilege proceedings,” said the source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lg-is-now-govt-in-delhi-aap-says-didnt-expect-this-during-pandemic/articleshow/82301635.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: 10% put off second vaccination dose for fear of stepping into hospitals||BHOPAL: At least 10% of people who have received the first dose of vaccine could not turn up for the second dose, primarily due to fear arising in the aftermath of the spread of infection. Sources said that internal assessment reveals that it is due to fear, following the spread of infection, that people are refraining from coming to hospitals. Primarily because the vaccination centres are set up at hospitals and clinics. Only if the frontline workers and health workers are considered then 8,31,075 beneficiaries were administered with the first dose but only 5,73,344 were administered with the second dose till now. This 2,57,731 workers however is not of those who did not turn up as the vaccination is still on and there are a few who are yet to complete the 28 days required for getting the second dose, said sources. Similarly, around 66 lakh people belonging to the 60 plus and 45 plus age group have been vaccinated in the state so far, but atleast 10% of the eligible ones, have not turned up for second dose of vaccination, said sources. Thus, overall around 7-8 lakh people are there who are eligible for the second dose but did not turn up. These are mainly those people who completed the required four-week time for the second dose in the month of April when the infection is widespread, thus, majority of these people, mostly elderlies have refrained from visiting hospitals for the second dose and are waiting for situation to normalise, said sources. This fear of getting infected due to the increase in spread of infection as well as the news regarding spread of virus through air, has led to this reluctance. This was also revealed in an internal assessment of the health department, said sources. Based on it, officials have now instructed the districts to plan out vaccination at places outside of the hospitals, like community halls, college campuses, schools etc, added sources. The main objective in the month of the May for the government is to ensure that those who have been administered with the first dose, also receive the second dose of vaccination and at the same time more and more people are covered in the universal vaccination of 18 to 44 year old beneficiaries which starts from May 1 onwards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-10-put-off-second-vaccination-dose-for-fear-of-stepping-into-hospitals/articleshow/82301656.cms||Amarjeet Singh
---||Delhi||‘People will die, you won’t do anything?’: Delhi HC to Centre on oxygen scarcity||NEW DELHI: “How many states are facing the kind of (oxygen) shortage Delhi is facing? People will keep dying and you will not do anything?” This is how an anguished Delhi high court bench questioned the Centre on Wednesday, observing that Delhi hadn’t received its allocated quantity of medical oxygen for a single day. The court was referring to the quantity of 490 metric tonnes (MT) of liquid medical oxygen allocated to Delhi. “What happened to that figure? What about the promise of 480-490 MT?” it asked. Senior advocate Rahul Mehra submitted that if the city’s daily supplies touched 490 MT in a day or two, a buffer of 10-20 MT could be maintained separately for individuals. “But it will depend on the oxygen supply,” he argued. The court then duly noted, “The allocation made by the Centre to Delhi is 490MT. Not for a single day has Delhi been able to receive the allocated quantity.” The court also expressed concern over the time taken by gas tankers in making round-trips from various locations to Delhi. ‘Sort out O 2 transportation to Delhi from 3 plants’Criticising the central government, it said, “You (Centre) have to do it on an SOS basis. You can't say one round of oxygen will take five days. You can airlift empty tankers. Why aren't you doing anything?” Additional SG Chetan Sharma responded by saying, “Whatever is humanly possible is being done on a real-time basis. There is complete coordination in this regard. There is no such thing that there is a gap.” The bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli, however, wasn’t satisfied and remarked, “Things haven’t improved.” Mehra acknowledged that in the past week, owing to the high court’s intervention and “street smartness” of two of Delhi government’s officers, a buffer was created and hundreds of lives were saved. However, he pointed out that a majority of hospitals were just building up pressure. To illustrate this, he said that while responding to an SOS from a hospital, it was discovered that 20 of the hospital’s 30 cylinders were full. Meanwhile, the bench appointed an amicus curiae (friend of the court) to study the central government’s medical oxygen allocation. Senior advocate Rajshekhar Rao has been asked by the court to communicate any suggestions he might have on maximising tanker usage and minimising transport time to solicitor general Tushar Mehta. “Independent of that, we hope and expect that the central government will look at the problems being faced in transportation of oxygen from the said three plants to Delhi,” the Justices said, referring to the plants at Durgapur, Rourkela and Kalinganagar in Odhisa, 1,500-1,600km from the capital. The high court also called on people to stand together in these trying times. “The nation is facing an unprecedented crisis. It is at times like these that people need to stand up and showcase qualities and virtues. We appeal to the good sense of people to not resort to black marketing or hoarding of either oxygen cylinders or medicines and to make them available to the needy people.” Expressing disapproval of a patient’s kin assaulting the medical staff at a hospital, the bench noted, “Such incidents are bound to demoralise the medical community, which is working tirelessly to save lives.” It hoped such misadventures would not recur and asked police to be vigilant in preventing any untoward incidents. The Delhi government also informed the court that Seth Air hadn’t engaged in hoarding or black marketing after the supplier’s logbook entries were put on record. On April 27, the high court had instructed the state government to take over the plant operated by the company. On Wednesday, the bench observed, “We have not ousted him…In normal circumstances we wouldn’t pass such drastic orders. We are dealing with a very difficult situation. We have to upgrade the action. We also realise we may be going a little overboard. But it is the need of the hour.” The issue of delays in discharging patients and subsequent delays in admitting other patients was highlighted before the bench by senior advocate Sachin Datta. The court noted, “After Covid treatment is over, the process of grant of no-objection by the insurance TPA is taking a long time – 5-8 hours – resulting in a delay in the discharge and admission of patients. Therefore, we direct all insurance companies and their TPAs to ensure that the time taken to grant the NOCs is reduced so that such problems do not arise.” Responding to the problem of a large section of people developing symptoms or testing positive for Covid but not getting access to doctors, the court suggested that the government “could invite such doctors to volunteer to render daily conferencing by adopting the ICMR protocol for treatment of Covid patients”. The bench said, “These doctors, offering their services voluntarily, could be assigned through a centralised system. The patients could dial the advertised number and calls could be redirected to the doctors for consultations.” The suggestion, the court highlighted, was worth serious consideration and directed both the Delhi and central governments to examine it. Taking note of another suggestion on assistance from the armed forces, the court observed that looking at the large number of Covid patients in the city, Delhi government could examine and take appropriate steps. It also considered the suggestion regarding the use of ambulances in the city in the current situation. It was put on record that at present ambulances were not being utilised for ferrying patients from homes to hospitals and vice versa. “Many of them are engaged in transporting dead bodies to cremation and burial grounds. Given the latest numbers of mortality, the vehicles have to wait in a queue to complete their journey,” the court noted. Therefore, the justices said, Delhi government could consider using DTC buses for transporting bodies of Covid patients so that ambulances could be left free to ferry patients to hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/people-will-die-you-wont-do-anything-delhi-hc-to-centre-on-oxygen-scarcity/articleshow/82301664.cms||Aamir Khan
---||Kochi||Kerala to buy 1 crore vaccine doses from manufacturers||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state cabinet on Wednesday decided to purchase one crore Covid-19 vaccine doses from manufacturers to address the shortage. These include 70 lakh units of Covishield from Serum Institute of India and 30 lakh units of Covaxin from Bharat Biotech. The government decided to place orders for the vaccine subject to the verdict of the high court and Supreme Court in related cases. The decision to buy vaccines for the next three months is based on recommendations of the expert committee led by chief secretary V P Joy. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the state would have to spend Rs 294 crore, excluding 5% GST, to purchase 70 lakh Covishield doses (at Rs 400/dose) and Rs 189 crore, including GST, for 30 lakh Covaxin doses (Rs 600/dose). The Centre is providing free vaccines only for those aged above 45, which itself is insufficient. He said that the Centre should provide free vaccines to all those aged above 18 besides intervening to ensure vaccines for states at the rate given to the Centre. The chief minister said his government was not for a lockdown at present while it felt tightening restrictions would be enough. However, he did not rule out the possibility of a lockdown, saying it will be considered only as the last option.

These include 70 lakh units of Covishield from Serum Institute of India and 30 lakh units of Covaxin from Bharat Biotech. The government decided to place orders for the vaccine subject to the verdict of the high court and Supreme Court in related cases. The decision to buy vaccines for the next three months is based on recommendations of the expert committee led by chief secretary V P Joy. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the state would have to spend Rs 294 crore, excluding 5% GST, to purchase 70 lakh Covishield doses (at Rs 400/dose) and Rs 189 crore, including GST, for 30 lakh Covaxin doses (Rs 600/dose). The Centre is providing free vaccines only for those aged above 45, which itself is insufficient. He said that the Centre should provide free vaccines to all those aged above 18 besides intervening to ensure vaccines for states at the rate given to the Centre. The chief minister said his government was not for a lockdown at present while it felt tightening restrictions would be enough. However, he did not rule out the possibility of a lockdown, saying it will be considered only as the last option. The state’s medical facilities are being strictly monitored, and steps have been taken to update the availability of beds in hospitals in each district every four hours, he said. The oxygen availability is sufficient in the state and only the excess will be shared with other states, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-to-buy-1-crore-vaccine-doses-from-manufacturers/articleshow/82301666.cms||---

Calling Vardhan’s statement shameless, party spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said India lacked basic infrastructure ranging from oxygen to hospital beds to vaccines. She said the Sero survey had warned the government of a devastating second wave but it was ignored. She said the government’s negligence has been so brazen that the empowered group of ministers on Covid didn’t meet for one year after its meeting in April 2020. “Who’s responsible for this criminal negligence,” she asked. She slammed PM Modi for blaming the “system” after being in power for seven years. “You are continuing with vanity projects like the Central Vista project. With what face do you seek help from the US and the UK who are asking you about these vanity projects?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/vardhan-should-step-down-says-congress/articleshow/82301668.cms||---

---||Goa||SC panel terms Mollem railway project ‘unjustified’, ‘potentially destructive’||Margao: Apart from concerns about the threat to the biodiversity hotspot of Mollem, as persistently underscored by TOI in its series of reports, the difficult terrain of the ghat section that still poses operational challenges to the Railways, and failure of the Railways in utilising most of the existing capacity of the single railway track, were the major reasons that led the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) of the Supreme Court to term the South Western Railway’s track doubling project as “inefficient”, “unjustified” and “potentially destructive,” a perusal of its report submitted to the Supreme Court on April 23 reveals. The CEC has smashed to smithereens all justifications proffered by the Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd (RVNL) for SWR’s double tracking project from Castlerock to Collem (Kulem), raising doubts essentially about capacity enhancement of the double track when it is proposed to be built parallel to the existing “equally inefficient track again with a steep 1:37 gradient”. “Since the proposed new line to be laid will be parallel to the existing line, it will be naturally following the same existing gradient (1:37, considered to be one of the toughest Ghat sections in Indian Railways) and will also be subjected to similar existing severe restrictions as the first line on the movement of trains up and down the Ghat. The second line therefore can increase the efficiency in the Ghat section only to the extent of availability of an additional line and is not likely to add either to the turn-around time of each train or loco or to the speed of the train,” the CEC report reads. Presently five engines — three engines in the front and two at the rear — are required to propel each train up the ghat section. Due to the existence of sharp curves and gradients in the section, trains run with severe constraints, including speed restrictions (30km/hr for goods trains and 40 km/hr for passengers), thereby increasing the running time of the train by six to 10 times the normal course. In its submissions to the CEC, RVNL had pointed out that on account of sharp curves and gradients in the ghat section, while all trains running down the ghat are required to mandatorily stop at every station enroute “to ensure that proper braking force is available and not to roll down”, trains going up the ghat are attached with Multiple Unit Locos for passenger trains and TLC (Tripled Loco Consist) for goods trains”. RVNL had further explained to the CEC that owing to the additional loco requirement for up ghat trains, these locos after reaching Castlerock are required to be sent back down ghat to haul the next up train. This loco balancing in the ghat section, RVNL told the CEC, was occupying most of the available path for trains resulting in underutilisation of the line capacity. This is what led the CEC to question the rationale of the Railways in building the second line along the same alignment. “The same arrangement and mechanism will need to be repeated in the proposed new line also thereby knowingly, there being no alternative, ensuring that this section of the new proposed second rail track passing through the wildlife sanctuary and the national park (Mollem) will continue to be one of the most inefficient railway track…In the present day context, while planning for extensive nationwide network of rail lines, any plan for doubling the existing most inefficient rail track between Castlerock and Kulem with a parallel equally inefficient track again with a steep 1:37 gradient along the existing alignment is not understood.” The CEC has further observed that on an average not even 20% of the existing capacity of the single railway line was being used by the hinterland in Karnataka for movement of goods to MPT, and that on an average about 92% of goods being transported from Goa to Karnataka through this line was coal. Pointing to the Railway’s response that the revised policy of government of India does not support import of coal and the new policy encourages use of indigenously mined coal, the CEC observed: “The change in policy combined with empty rakes reaching Goa from Karnataka only goes to confirm the huge existing capacity available in the present single track itself for transport of goods from Karnataka to Mormugao Port and back.” The CEC has also effectively dismissed the Biodiversity and Environmental Assessment Report between Collem and Castlerock prepared by Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. Referring to observations of National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) that the report “lacks in critical assessment, particularly of project impacts, and merely reiterates project proponent’s views”, the CEC in its report stated that while the recommendations and mitigation measures were “fairly generic in nature,” certain suggestions were “impractical and theoretical.” Significantly, the CEC has suggested that a cumulative cost benefit analysis be done of the track doubling project and the widening of NH 4-A “in the interest of sustainable development”. The panel has also pointed out the irregularities on the part of the standing committee of National Board of Wildlife (NBWL) in granting approval for the project in the Goa stretch. The CEC questioned why NBWL chose not to obtain the recommendation of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) in respect of Castlerock–Kulem railway line as it had done for the Karnataka part, thereby “bypassing” the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Environment Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC). The CEC also said that there was a “strong case” for use of ports in the east coast as an alternative to MPT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sc-panel-terms-mollem-railway-project-unjustified-potentially-destructive/articleshow/82299493.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

---||World||Daniel Kaminsky, internet security saviour, dies||Daniel Kaminsky, a security researcher known for his discovery of a fundamental flaw in the fabric of the internet, died on Friday at his home in San Francisco. He was 42. His aunt, Dr Toby Maurer, said the cause was diabetes ketoacidosis. In 2008, Kaminsky was widely hailed as a latter-day, digital Paul Revere after he found a serious flaw in the internet’s basic plumbing that could allow skilled coders to take over websites, siphon off bank credentials or even shut down the internet. Kaminsky alerted the department of homeland security, and helped spearhead a patch. He was a respected practitioner of “penetration testing,” the business of compromising the security of computer systems at the behest of owners who want to harden their systems from attack. It was a profession that his mother, Trudy Maurer, said he first developed a knack for at 4 years old. By age 5, Maurer said, Kaminsky had taught himself to code. When Kaminsky was 11, his mother said, she received an angry phone call from someone who identified himself as a network administrator for the Western United States. The administrator said someone at her residence was “monkeying around in territories where he shouldn’t be.” Without her knowledge, Kaminsky had been examining military websites. The administrator vowed to “punish” him. The family spent three days without internet. Nearly two decades after he lost his access to the internet, Kaminsky wound up saving it. What Kaminsky discovered in 2008 was a problem with the Internet’s Domain Name System, or DNS, a dynamic phone book that converts human-friendly web addresses into their machine-friendly numeric counterparts. He found a way that thieves or spies could covertly manipulate DNS traffic so that a person typing the website for a bank would instead be redirected to an impostor site that could steal the user’s account number and password. Kaminsky’s first call was to Paul Vixie, a longtime steward of the internet’s DNS system. Over the course of several days, they cobbled together a solution in stealth, a fix that Vixie compared to dog excrement. The web was spared. In 2005, researchers discovered Sony BMG was covertly installing software on PCs to combat music piracy, Sony played down the move. Kaminsky forced the issue into public awareness after discovering the software had infected more than 568,000 computers.

A division bench comprising justices Ashok Menon and Murali Purushothaman sought Centre’s response after considering, during admission hearing, a petition filed by doctors KP Aravindan and Praveen G Pai. The petitioners are seeking a court order setting aside the new policy, Liberalised Pricing and Accelerated National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy, to the extent it provides for a differential pricing between central and state governments. Other demands in the petition include a directive to the central government to procure and distribute vaccines to state governments for free, to transfer the technology of manufacturing Covaxin to all interested manufacturers, to fix a price ceiling for vaccines, to expedite vaccine acquisition from all available national and international resources, to grant emergency authorization to all available vaccines and to publish all information on approved vaccines and those in development, including intellectual property on them. It is contended by the petitioners that the central government’s decision not to provide free vaccination to those between 18 and 45 years of age is unjustifiable and arbitrary. Vaccines should fall under the list of essential medicines and the central government cannot shirk its responsibility to cap the prices of vaccines, resulting in exorbitant prices in the free market, the petition said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-high-court-seeks-centres-view-on-vaccine-pricing/articleshow/82301692.cms||---

But we pointed out that people will not allow us to enter the villages if decisive action is not taken. It is the bureaucracy and the office of the advocate general (AG) that is responsible for the mess,” said an MLA after the meeting. Sources said the MLAs demanded that to correct the negative perception building against the Congress government, there should have been visible action against the Badals. The Congress MLAs also demanded that if any MLAs are involved in any unscrupulous activities, they too should have been taken to task and the state government should have been on the front foot. “The CM told us that he will take legal opinion over the next two days and finalise the next step. However, most MLAs were of the view that the promise of taking action against those behind the sacrilege has not been taken and it could hurt the Congress badly. They said the new SIT should be given a shorter time frame,” said another MLA. After the fireworks at the last Cabinet meeting, Punjab chief minister has been holding meetings with party MLAs over the last two days. On Wednesday, MLAs from Doaba and Maja regions were called for a briefing about the legal lacunae that led to an unexpected turn of events into the probe of the sacrilege issues. “Two retired judges and the AG were present, along with Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar. They tried to explain the legal position in the Kotkapura firing case. But a section of the MLAs was not satisfied. They pointed out that people are not interested in the ramifications but want to know the outcome of the investigations carried out over the last four years,” said a Congress leader. On Tuesday, Amarinder and Jakhar had met with MLAs from the Malwa region and many of them had flagged the anxiety over the alleged delay in justice over the sacrilege cases. Some of them also complained about the missing organisational structure of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) even though elections are around the corner. ‘Sidhu should follow party rules’ A day after the chief minister hit out at Navjot Singh Sidhu, cabinet minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot it is up to Sidhu whether he wants to continue to be in the Congress, but he will have to abide by the rules and the systems of the party. “He has been repeatedly targeting the CM. Even family members tolerate this,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cong-mlas-vent-ire-over-sacrilege-say-time-running-out/articleshow/82299689.cms||Vibhor Mohan
---||World||Michael Collins, ‘forgotten astronaut’ of Apollo 11, dies||Michael Collins, who piloted the Apollo 11 spacecraft Columbia in orbit 97km above the moon while his crewmates, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, became the first men to walk on the lunar surface, died of cancer on Wednesday. He was 90. Often described as the “forgotten” third astronaut on the historic mission, Collins remained alone in the command module for over 21 hours until his two fellow astronauts returned. “Not since Adam has any human known such solitude as Mike Collins,” the mission log said, referring to the biblical figure. When the lunar module Eagle, descending from Columbia, touched down on the moon on July 20, 1969, Collins lost contact with his crewmates and with Nasa, his line of communication blocked as he passed over the moon’s far side. “I am alone now, truly alone, and absolutely isolated from any known life,” he wrote of the moment in his 1974 memoir, “Carrying the Fire.” After 48 minutes cut off from any human voice, he emerged from moon’s far side. He contacted Nasa and learned that the lunar module had touched down safely, Armstrong having radioed: “...The Eagle has landed.” Collins had carried a packet around his neck containing 18 contingency plans for rescuing his crewmates. His strongest memory from Apollo 11, he said, was looking back at the Earth, which he said seemed “fragile”. Acting Nasa administrator Steve Jurczyk hailed Collins as “a true pioneer”.

This would be one of the first major IPOs from the new generation of Indian internet startups. Of the total, nearly $1 billion will be through the issue of fresh shares. Zomato’s early investor Info Edge will sell shares worth $100 million (around Rs 750 crore) through an offer for sale (OFS). Zomato, according to the filings, may also consider raising $200 million (about Rs1,500 crore ) more in a pre-IPO round. This would be on top of over $900 million it raised in the last 12-18 months. Info Edge, parent firm of online portal Naukri, first invested in Zomato in 2010 and still holds about 19%. The Gurgaon-based firm was valued at $5.4 billion after the last financing round. Sources said Zomato could go public at a valuation range of $7-9 billion. If successful, Zomato’s IPO would also set the stage for other local startups aiming to go public this year and the next. Zomato’s rival Swiggy, which is valued at $5 billion, is in the final stages of talks to raise around $450 million from SoftBank. Zomato says its competitors include Swiggy, Domino’s, McDonald’s, Pizza Hut and cloud kitchen major Rebel Foods. Among its risk factors, it has said there is “intense competition in food delivery and other businesses”. “We expect our costs to increase over time and our losses will continue given significant investments expected towards growing our business,” Zomato, founded by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah in 2008, said in its filing. Zomato said it saw revenue of nearly $184 million in the first nine months of the last fiscal (between April and December, 2020), while its losses were close to $92 million. It has identified advertisement and sales & promotional expenses as key to acquiring new users and building its brand among consumers. It spent around 49% of its total income for advertising and promotions in the financial year ended March 2020, while the same in the April to December 2020 period was under 23%. Zomato plans to use 75% of its IPO proceeds for organic and inorganic expansion in five years. “We expect to utilise at least 40% of the proposed deployment towards funding organic growth initiatives,” the company said. This would be largely in the areas of customer and user acquisition, delivery and technology infrastructure. “We have made these investments in the past, and we expect these to continue to be critical for the growth of our business in the future,” it added. Info Edge shares on Tuesday ended 1.5% higher on the BSE following Zomato’s DRHP filing with Sebi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/zomato-files-for-8200-crore-ipo/articleshow/82301714.cms||---

Call centres and control rooms have been opened for guest workers at the Labour Commissionerate and 14 district headquarters to raise awareness and ensure social security. Officials who speak these languages are assigned to answer the workers’ queries. In addition, guest worker facilitation centres are also being set up in various districts. “We have worked out alternate action plans for the guest workers so that they do not have any difficulty in continuing to work in the state. Our aim is to ensure their welfare. We are looking at three scenarios -- if there is no lockdown, in case of lockdown and in case of contracting Covid,” said labour commissioner S Chitra. She said that guest workers were still coming to work, mainly at Thiruvananthapuram and Ernakulam. “We will also look into cases of people who would want to go home. Last year, ration kits were given to all workers during the lockdown. It will be continued and hence registration of all guest workers is being done to ensure that nobody is missed out. The first list is expected to be ready by April 30,” labour commissioner said. Meanwhile, officials informed that assistant labour officers across the state are working to register guest workers on the Cowin portal for vaccinations. Labour officers will ensure that hospital and ambulance services are put on standby. Posters and video, audio WhatsApp messages are being sent to ensure that the community leaders are alert. Besides, industries and establishments have been asked to ensure their welfare. Covid checkpoints have been set up in each district to detect the spread of the disease among guest workers and to intensify preventive measures. The department is considering setting up special Covid first-line treatment centres in Ernakulam and Thiruvananthapuram. District collectors have been instructed to find adequate institutions to set up camps for guest workers in case of emergencies. The railways have been asked to help prepare and hand over the details of the guest workers returning home. Steps are also being taken to set up facilitation centres at major railway stations. Labour Commissioner Chithra said that the guest workers should be paid by their employers during the quarantine period and steps would be taken to enforce it vigorously.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-labour-department-steps-in-to-guest-workers-aid/articleshow/82301727.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

But it also cautioned that the surge in cases could hurt the recovery. The ADB forecast assumes that vaccines are deployed extensively across the country and the second wave of Covid is contained. The multilateral agency has upgraded India’s GDP growth projections from its earlier estimate of 8% expansion. The devastation caused by the second wave has triggered worries about the health of the economy and economists say the localised lockdowns across the country could hurt growth. Ratings agency ICRA on Wednesday said it expects the country’s GDP to grow by 10-10.5% in FY22 as against 10-11% expected earlier. The key downside risks to its forecasts are a continuation of the new wave of infections, an extension of the restrictions and severe restrictions being imposed in additional states and the existing vaccines not being effective enough against the new variants. Expenditure secy is finance secretaryExpenditure secretary T V Somanathan has been designated as the finance secretary, a personnel ministry order issued on Wednesday said.

The practical examinations were supposed to begin on May 5. The fresh time table for the IT practical examinations would be announced later, said an official statement from the director of general education and examination commissioner Jeevan Babu on Wednesday. The SSLC theory examinations would be over on April 29 (Thursday). Following widespread protest against the intervention by the rights panel, the general education department had postponed the higher secondary practical examinations on Monday. Though there were similar demands to postpone or suspend the SSLC IT practical examinations, the government was of the opinion that there was no valid reason for such a demand. The theory examinations were held adhering to strict Covid-19 protocol. As many as 4,22,226 students have registered for this school final examination.

The practical examinations were supposed to begin on May 5. The fresh time table for the IT practical examinations would be announced later, said an official statement from the director of general education and examination commissioner Jeevan Babu on Wednesday.

Following widespread protest against the intervention by the rights panel, the general education department had postponed the higher secondary practical examinations on Monday. Though there were similar demands to postpone or suspend the SSLC IT practical examinations, the government was of the opinion that there was no valid reason for such a demand. The theory examinations were held adhering to strict Covid-19 protocol. As many as 4,22,226 students have registered for this school final examination. There are 2,947 examination centres, which includes nine centres each in gulf Countries and Lakshadweep.

The Neelachal executive association said production in the steel plant in Odisha’s Kalinganagar has been stopped since March last year after the government began privatisation proceedings. It said the 418-tonnes-per-day oxygen plant was commissioned in 2013. The association also urged the government to merge NINL with SAIL, RINL or NMDC and save its assets. It also said employees have not been paid their salaries and 12 months’ wages were pending. The government has received multiple bids for the privatisation of NINL and the process has moved to the next stage. The department of investment and public asset management (Dipam) had invited bids in January for the privatisation of NINL.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/psu-steel-cos-staff-seeks-to-restart-o2-plant/articleshow/82301740.cms||---

He said Sidhu lacked consistency and he had information that he was also touch with Aam Aadmi Party supremo Arvind Kejriwal. Asked the reason for their discord, Amarinder said: "Sidhu is an opportunist. First, he fought with the Akalis – the Badals and Majithia. Then he came to the BJP and despite their making him an MP, he fought with them, too. He came to us and now he tweets against me repeatedly. I am the Punjab CM, a representative of the Congress president who appointed me. If he attacks me, he attacks my leadership indirectly." Claiming that Sidhu has met Kejriwal three or four times, The CM said: "If he is preparing to fight election from Patiala, I say welcome." Asked why Sidhu would do that, Amarinder replied: "Ambition. He’s been a good cricketer but that was 35 years ago. He thinks he’s a great actor but laughing in a chair is not acting. He speaks well but what people want is consistency, and something done for the constituency." Asked why he had removed him as minister for local government, the CM said: "Files were not cleared from his table for up to seven months. Urban areas are our support base. If our projects are stuck, how will the Congress succeed. Then he tried for Pradesh Congress president but why should we remove Jakhar, so senior to him? Also, he’s a great friend of Imran Khan, so I can’t give him any other sensitive portfolio? Asked about the chances for reconciliation, he said: "For me the door is closed, it’s up to the high command now."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/imran-friend-cant-get-home-dept-amarinder/articleshow/82299733.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab brings parity in building bylaws, offers benefits to developers||Chandigarh: Punjab has decided to have parity in the building bylaws followed by the departments of local government and that of housing, resulting in benefits for developers such as reduction of minimum area for a plotted colony under the affordable housing scheme and an increase in the saleable area in commercial colonies. Considering the ground reality of high land prices and unavailability of suitable land in some cities, it has been decided to reduce the minimum area from 5 acres to 1.5 acre for plotted development and bring it down from 2 acres to 0.5 acre for group housing, said an official. Earlier, for the commercial colonies under Punjab Apartment and Property Regulation Act (PAPRA), 40% saleable area was allowed but now it has been decided to give an extra benefit of 5%. Besides, promoters who have already paid the entire amount of EDC charges or regularisation charges don’t need to pay extra connectivity charges for water and sewerage connections. Also, outstanding dues of ED on real estate projects can be paid in six half yearly instalments along with the applicable interest by way of post-dated cheques. Several representations have been received pointing out the differences in the norms being followed by the local government department and the department of housing. The approval of CLU and building plan is made under PAPA by the two departments. As per the decision a park will be 5% of the area of the affordable housing project. The maximum saleable area will not be more than 65% of the total site area. For town planning schemes, a promoter who intends to develop a land into a colony will have to get a promoter license, besides a CLU and license from a competent authority. The local government department gives 5% additional FAR to the buildings which have green rating Puda has allowed FAR of up to 10% “In case of SCOs and SCFs, 100% coverage area is allowed on plots with depth upto 24 m and height upto 15 m whereas earlier 20% of the area was required to be left. This will give a big relief to property owners who bought commercial sites,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-brings-parity-in-building-bylaws-offers-benefits-to-developers/articleshow/82299761.cms||Vibhor Mohan

In the wake of the second wave of infections, these apex rural bodies in several villages across India have banned the sale of cold items and prohibited entry of outsiders. This has also impacted the sales of FMCG items, ranging from chips and curd to fruit juices and biscuits as working hours of shops have been curtailed and entry of outsiders prohibited. “We are facing a strange problem,” said a senior executive at one of the largest beverage companies in India. “The elders in these villages are alleging that cold products increase the risk of contracting Covid-related infections.” “Even the sale of ‘srikhand’ is not being allowed in several village clusters,” said the sales head of a large food company. While TOI has reviewed some of the notices that have been issued by the panchayats. Emails sent to MNCs such as Coca-Cola India and PepsiCo India did not elicit any response. “Any business related to cold items such as cold drinks and ice creams will not be allowed in the village,” stated one notice. “There is only one entry point and one exit point and outsiders will not be allowed.” “Shops will be allowed to open only from 7am to 9am. Violators will be fined Rs 500,” said another. “It’s like a Chinese whisper. You know how it is. Some doctor would have said that soft drink gives you a bad throat and that would have spread like wildfire,” said Rakesh Khanna, proprietor of a local cola brand City Cola. “Business is down by 90%.” The current situation in rural India is a far cry from the final few months of last year, when demand in rural and semi-urban India was outstripping that of urban India on the back of strong government support, reverse migration of labour and good agriculture. “Unlike the first wave, the virus has not spared rural India this time. There are several clusters that have high rates of infections,” said Subhashis Basu, COO at Prataap Snacks. “Although there isn’t a complete lockdown and demand is still higher in rural than urban, sales have slowed down.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/panchayats-block-soft-drink-ice-cream-cos/articleshow/82301746.cms||John Sarkar
---||Business||Bad bank to get Rs 2 lakh crore of defaulting companies’ loans||MUMBAI: The Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) has asked members to identify large loans where they are lead bankers and get approval from colenders so that these loans can be sold to a National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARC, or the bad bank). The association has identified 102 corporate bad loans, totalling to Rs 2 lakh crore, where the amount outstanding in each is over Rs 500 crore. They include loans in a variety of industries. These have been languishing in the books of banks for years with many admitted under the insolvency process. These loans are almost fully provided for over the years and they exclude the ones where there is fraud involved or those currently under liquidation. Approval from 75% of the lenders by value is required to transfer the loans to an ARC. The IBA had proposed a public sector bad bank to take over bad loans of Indian lenders. A bad bank is expected to be more efficient in recovery as it will step into the shoes of multiple lenders who currently have different compulsions when it comes to resolving a bad loan. “In the first phase, lenders are expected to approve the transfer of 30-40 loans by next week,” said a senior banker. He said that the framework for transferring the loans from the books of banks is already in place. Once the lenders decide on selling the loan, the NARC will make them an offer based on the scope of recovery. With the NARC’s offer on hand, the lenders will hold a ‘Swiss Challenge’, where rivals are allowed to better the offer made by a chosen bidder. While rival ARCs in the private sector will be given an option to bid, it is unlikely they will succeed. This is because the security receipts issued by the NARC for 85% of the value of the loans would be guaranteed by the government. Since private companies do not have government guarantee, they can only hope to win if they can provide cash. The advantage for banks is that these 102 loans have been largely provided for. The NARC will be paying up to 15% of the agreed value for the loans in cash. The NARC is also expected to do a good job in recovery as it will create a trust that will assign the task to an asset management company (AMC) in the private sector. Each corporate nonperforming asset (NPA) will be converted into a special purpose vehicle, which will be sold by the AMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bad-bank-to-get-rs-2l-cr-of-defaulting-cos-loans/articleshow/82301750.cms||Mayur Shetty

Of the online registrations, 90% users registered after 4pm, when the portal began accepting 18-plus beneficiaries, a senior official said. The exact numbers of new beneficiaries would be a dynamic figure, officials said. In the first three hours (4-7pm), 383 million API hits, initially as high as 2.7 million hits per minute, were recorded. As many as 1.45 crore text messages were successfully delivered, the health ministry said. Read AlsoMost states postpone May 1 vaccination planMay 1 was to be a ‘hope day’ for the country, beginning a big bang inoculation drive for the youth. But, on Wednesday, when the registration process began, most states put off their plans, faced with vaccine shortage while many beneficiaries could not get dates for inoculation.Times ViewMillions logged in yesterday hoping to register and schedule an appointment for vaccination. Social media is filled with posts of disappointment for being unable to set up a date for the jab. We only hope that the scheduling is enabled at the earliest. The vaccination process must be accelerated to control the outbreak.The registration process was accompanied by the announcement that appointments at state government centres and private centres will depend on how many centres are ready on May 1 for vaccination of 18-plus beneficiaries. Several states have in the past few days indicated they may not be able to begin the drive on May 1 as they are still tying up supplies. Coronavirus live updatesThe platform experienced initial glitches as the system was flooded with registration requests and OTPs were not received and dropdown menus did not function for a while. The portal, however, became accessible after a while and registrations proceeded smoothly shortly after being opened. Though scheduling was not possible, the surge in registrations and high interest in the younger population as evident on social media and WhatsApp conversations was a welcome sign amid concerns that fresh infections are discouraging people from getting vaccinated. It will help convince states, private hospitals and vaccine-makers that there is a demand for inoculation. Read AlsoSII cuts vaccine price for states to Rs 300/dose, terms it a ‘philanthropic gesture’Facing a public outcry over pricing of Covishield, Serum Institute of India on Wednesday announced a 25% or Rs 100 reduction in its price for state governments, describing it as a “philanthropic gesture”. The bad news is that at Rs 300 a shot, it will still be twice what the Centre is paying, ForAs of now, jabs are available in private hospitals only for 45-plus people till the end of the month. Thereafter the Centre-supported vaccine rollout for this category will be available only in government hospitals. Under the new scheme, states, private hospitals and corporates can access 50% production of Covishield and Covaxin for the 18 and above category. The intention, according to central officials, is to allow states more leeway in planning drives and creating incentives for vaccine-manufacturers to boost production. The higher price at private hospitals will also allow those who can pay to reduce the load on government facilities. So far, the drive was driven by walk-in registrations. Of the total 14.71 crore registrations so far, 9.33 crore are walk-ins, 2.82 crore people are online. Around 2.55 crore health and frontline workers have also been registered by state governments. According to officials, online registrations witnessed a major jump after 4pm on Wednesday. For people between 18 and 44 years, online registration and booking of appointments is mandatory for inoculation. Eligible beneficiaries can register directly on the Co-Win portal (cowin.gov.in) or through the Aarogya Setu app. The government maintained that appointment for 18 to 44 is based on slots made available by private vaccination centres as well as respective state governments. While many were disappointed with the unavailability of slots, officials urged patience and said they will soon be offered. "Things will improve within 8-10 days. Most states and private hospitals are still tying up with vaccine manufacturers. For many, supplies are on the way. Also, private hospitals right now are strained because of rise in infection. So resources are limited but it will improve as we move on," a senior official said. While initially some people faced issues in registration, the health ministry said the server supporting the Co-Win digital portal continues to work smoothly at its highest efficiency. "These statistics indicate that far from crashing or performing slowly, the system is performing without any glitches. It is recording 55,000 hits per second and is completely stable," it said.
