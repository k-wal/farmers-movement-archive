According to police, the assailants in an SUV, two cars and a pick-up jeep were speeding and they started firing at a patrol party at 11pm when the cops tried to stop them for checking. “The police team at Sricharbhuja temple under Kotadi police station attempted to stop them. The passengers in the vehicles started firing intermittently,” said a senior police officer. “One constable Onkar Raika (25) was injured. He was rushed to the hospital where he succumbed. He had taken bullets on his chest and other parts,” he added. Soon after, police started barricading the district’s borders and alerted every police station in the area. However, about 30 minutes later, unknown assailants again opened fire almost 40km from the previous spot at Raila area of Bhilwara, injuring and killing another constable. “The constable, identified as Pawan Chaudhary (27), sustained bullet injuries and fell unconscious. Our team rushed him to the hospital where he was declared brought dead,” the officer said. Preliminary investigation suggested that the same gang was involved in both the incidents. “We have recovered a jeep and one more vehicle involved in the firing. A large quantity of narcotics, mainly poppy husk, has also been recovered,” said Bhilwara superintendent of police Vikas Sharma. He said some suspects have been detained. “We have concrete information on the whereabouts of the smugglers. They will be caught soon,” he added. Bhilwara additional SP Chanchal Mishra said a case of murder and obstructing officials from discharge of duty has been registered against unidentified accused. CM Ashok Gehlot condoled the deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/drug-smugglers-open-fire-kill-2-constables-in-rajasthan/articleshow/82021088.cms||---

Post the data breach, the company on its website said all of the customers’ shares and funds were safe and it has enhanced the security system at its servers. In the last few weeks there have been massive data breaches at some of the leading domestic and global companies which include Mobikwik, LinkedIn and Facebook. On Saturday, Upstox on its website said that it has upgraded its security systems after it received emails claiming unauthorized access into its database. “These claims suggested that some contact data and KYC details may have been compromised from third-party data-warehouse systems,” Ravi Kumar, Upstox’s co-founder and CEO wrote on its site. On Saturday, some web security analysts also tweeted about the data breach, saying data of 25 lakh users were leaked. The data breach happened at a third-party data warehouse and the files were put up on the dark web, sources said. Recently there were reports of a breach at digital payment firm MobiKwik involving 11 crore of its users. After this data breach RBI had asked for a report from the firm. Post this data breach, Upstox fortified its systems to the highest standards, Kumar wrote in his post. It immediately restricted access to the impacted database, added multiple security enhancements at all third party data-warehouses, set up real-time, 24x7 monitoring and also ring-fenced its network, he said. “As a matter of abundant caution, we have also initiated a secure password reset via OTP.” “We would like to assure you that your funds and securities are protected and remain safe. Funds can only be moved to your linked bank accounts and your securities are held with the relevant depositories,” Kumar wrote. Upstox, backed by investors like Tiger Global and Ratan Tata, has nearly 30 lakh users, making it the second biggest broker in terms of client numbers behind Zerodha. Over the last three years, boosted by sliding data prices and easy availability of smart phones, discount brokerages including Upstox have ramped up their operations and grown their client base many fold. In the process these brokerages, working on wafer thing costs of trading, have also run ahead of traditional big players in the sector like ICICI Securities, HDFC Securities and others. Recently Upstox also signed up with Broad of Cricket in India to be one of the sponsors of Indian Premier League (IPL).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/upstox-face-data-breach-co-says-ramped-up-security/articleshow/82021166.cms||---

Calling it “genocide”, Mamata said, “They were shot in the neck and chest, not the lower parts of the body” and added that the 72-hour ban on politicians entering Cooch Behar — which prevented her from meeting the bereaved families — would allow “evidence to be destroyed”. The EC should rename the Model Code of Conduct the Modi Code of Conduct, she told reporters in Siliguri, north Bengal. Rejecting her allegations and accusing her of “politicising” the deaths, Shah told reporters in Nadia district that it was Mamata’s “gherao CRPF” call that had provoked the clash. He also said, “A voter by the name of Ananda Burman was killed but Mamata Didi condoled only the deaths of the other four people as he’s not from her vote bank,” — a reference to them being from a minority community. TMC later said the CM had referred to all five deaths and the plaque where she paid homage on Sunday bore all five names, not four.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/its-genocide-says-didi-cm-provoked-it-counters-shah/articleshow/82021223.cms||---

The CBI is likely to record Deshmukh’s statement this week. The two staffers — Sanjeev Palande and Kundan Shinde — were questioned on the basis of statements given by Singh and arrested API Sachin Waze, who have claimed that the duo was privy to Deshmukh’s demands, said sources. The duo was questioned at the DRDO guest house in Santacruz, said officials. Singh had alleged in a letter that Palande was present when Deshmukh allegedly asked Waze to extort over Rs 100 crore a month from bars and restaurants in Mumbai. Similarly, Waze had purportedly claimed that Kundan was present during the demands made by Deshmukh. The CBI has filed a preliminary inquiry into the matter on Bombay HC’s order and has to submit a report by early next week. The agency will inform the HC whether or not a regular case is made out and if an in-depth investigation is required. On Friday, the agency had questioned former constable Vinayak Shinde and bar owner Mahesh Shetty in the case. Shinde was arrested by the NIA in the Mansukh Hiren murder case. The CBI also recorded the statement of DCP Raju Bhujbal and questioned Singh and Waze again on Friday. The CBI has also sought the diary and documents that were seized from Waze. The CBI also recorded the statements of two drivers working for Waze. Singh first wrote a letter to the CM stating that Deshmukh had called Waze and ACP Sanjay Patil along with DCP Raju Bhujbal separately at his official residence and made his demand. In his letter, Singh alleged that when Deshmukh had called Waze at his residence, one or two staff members of the minister, including Palande, were present. In a letter that Waze wanted to submit to the special court during his remand , it was alleged that Kundan Shinde was present when Deshmukh made his extortion demand. The letter said Shinde suggested that Waze comply with Deshmukh’s demand to keep his job.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cbi-questions-2-aides-of-deshmukh-may-soon-call-ex-min-for-statement/articleshow/82021393.cms||Raj Shekhar

They were cremated on the outskirts of their village Panchu Mandal Tola in Bihar’s Purnia. Kumar’s mother was suffering from several age-related ailments. His father had died around seven years ago, Kumar’s maternal uncle Subhash Singh told TOI over phone. “She died of heart attack around 5.30am on Sunday. Initially, she wasn’t told about the incident, but her condition started deteriorating after Kumar’s body reached home on Saturday,” he said. Purnia divisional commissioner Rahul Ranjan Mahiwal, IG (Purnia range) Suresh Prasad Choudhary, DM Rahul Kumar, SP Daya Shankar, Kishnganj SDPO Anwar Jawed and other civil and police officers were present during the cremation. Kumar is survived by his wife and three minor children, including two daughters. The SHO was a 1994-batch inspector-rank officer. He was posted as Kishanganj Town SHO on August 5, 2020. Kishanganj SP Kumar Ashish said the mastermind, Mohammad Israel, and his son Mohammad Abdul were arrested on Sunday for their alleged involvement in Kumar’s lynching at Pantapara village in Bengal’s North Dinajpur district on Saturday. Three persons were arrested in this connection on Saturday. He said it was Israel who had used the public address system of a mosque to instigate people, who attacked Kumar. He said police also arrested two more accused from border area when they were trying to escape with a looted bike on Saturday after the incident. “They are also accused in the SHO’s murder case. It is the same bike which was looted from Kishanganj Town area on Saturday. Kumar and his team had gone to Pantapara to recover it,” the SP said, adding that altogether 21 named and 500 unknown people have been made accused in the lynching case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lynched-shos-mom-dies-of-shock-cremated-together/articleshow/82021511.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Though Delhi Police officials say delivery boys with passes can commute, due to fewer passes and lack of clarity, the service has been affected in the city. On Thursday, some delivery boys in south Delhi were stopped from delivering food post curfew hours. Restaurateur Bobby Kochhar says, “Our delivery boys faced issues after the curfew announcement, when they were out for delivery. Usually, we take orders till 11pm, but are now closing the restaurant by 10pm till there’s clarity on whether food can be delivered beyond 10pm.” Spokespersons from food delivery companies Zomato and Swiggy say that they are doing their best to work with the restaurants and state authorities to follow safety guidelines and deliver meals to people. Food delivery comes under essential servicesDinner orders have been affected‘Restros have set their time for last orders’The National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) has written a letter to the Delhi Lieutenant Governor, Delhi Chief Minister, Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) Secretary and Delhi Police Commissioner seeking clarity on the matter. The letter states, “The restaurant industry is facing severe challenges and harassment by authorities in Delhi in continuing with food delivery services beyond curfew hours. The actions by authorities include issuing challans and even workers being detained by the police. This is a serious situation, especially at a time when the industry was once again in the process of re-hiring its employees.” Kabir Suri, Vice President, NRAI says, “The police officials on ground have no clarity, so they’re stopping delivery boys. Restaurants have set their own time for last orders, but most of them are closing at 10pm. We have taken up this matter with the authorities.” Dwarka resident Ishika Rao, whose niece had placed her dinner order at 8.30pm and received it after 10.30pm, says, “The delivery boy said that we should have ordered in evening as restaurant isn’t operating beyond 10pm, adding that he took a longer route to our home to deliver the meal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/night-curfew-limited-passes-hit-delhis-delivery-boys-hard/articleshow/82018093.cms||Niharika Lal
---||Mumbai||Ambani bomb scare case: Sachin Waze’s right-hand man in crime unit held||MUMBAI: The NIA on Sunday arrested one more police officer, API Riyazuddin Kazi, in the Ambani explosives and Mansukh Hiran murder case. Kazi, who worked under arrested API Sachin Waze in the crime intelligence unit (CIU), is the fourth individual and third police personnel to be arrested in the case. A special NIA court remanded him in police custody till Friday. The NIA, seeking custody for 10 days, argued that at Waze’s behest, Kazi destroyed evidence in the case while being aware of the conspiracy. The prosecution argued that the NIA needed to interrogate Kazi on his role in the planting of the gelatine sticks near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence and the murder of Mansukh Hiran, whose Scorpio was found parked with the explosives. ‘Kazi cooperating, may be made an approver’Kazi is accused of going to Waze’s Saket cooperative housing society in Thane under the pretext of investigation and forcibly taking away and damaging the DVR that contained the CCTV footage of the Scorpio parked there by Waze for a week before the planting of the gelatin sticks.  He is also accused of forcibly taking away DVRs from the shops in Thane from where he, at the behest of Waze, got several fake number plates made. Kazi is learnt to have said to the NIA that he had followed Waze’s orders as he was heading the CIU. Sources said that Kazi was cooperating with the investigation and had given leads in the case, and that he might be made an approver. In the CIU, Kazi was part of all high-profile cases in the recent past, including the fake Twitter accounts case, the call centre racket, the TRP scam and the case of dual registration of vehicles involving car designer Dilip Chhabria. Kazi was recently transferred to the local arms unit and, like Waze, is likely to be suspended. In court, public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves, seeking custody for 10 days, said: “The duo (Waze and Kazi) started to destroy the evidence after the case was handed over to NIA on March 8. Kazi was well aware of the entire matter as the Scorpio, whose theft case was registered at Vikhroli police station and later was used in planting gelatine sticks near Antilia, was parked inside Waze’s apartment in Thane, but he did not raise an alarm.” Defence counsel Hasnain Kazi said Riyazuddin Kazi had been made a scapegoat in the case. “My client has maintained a diary entry of everything,” he said. “If he was involved then why would he make a diary entry?” Earlier, another officer close to Waze, assistant police inspector (API) Prakash Howald, had been questioned by the NIA, though he was not arrested. The other two arrested in the case so far are dismissed police constable Vinayak Shinde and Gujarat bookie Naresh Gor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ambani-case-wazes-right-hand-man-in-crime-unit-held/articleshow/82021671.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||India||As ‘Tika Utsav’ gets underway, Modi calls for optimum utilisation of vaccination capacity||NEW DELHI: As the four-day ‘Tika Utsav’ (vaccine festival) he had called for got under way, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday appealed for optimum utilisation of the country's vaccination capacity. “We have to move towards optimum utilisation of the country's vaccination capacity. This is also a way to increase our capacity,” the PM said and added, “Our success will be determined by our awareness of the ‘micro containment zone’, not to leave the house when there is no need, when the eligible are vaccinated and will also depend on whether we wear masks and follow other rules.” Terming accelerated vaccination as the second round of the fight against Covid-19, the PM pitched for a four-point action plan — ‘each one, vaccinate one’, ‘each one, treat one’, ‘each one, save one’ and designation and enforcement of ‘micro containment zones’. On the first day of the vaccination campaign coinciding with the birth anniversary of social reformer Jyotiba Phule, Modi reiterated that enforcement of ‘micro-containment’ zones with the help of those infected and their kin was crucial to check the second surge of infections. The four-day campaign for vaccination will conclude the birthday of Dalit icon and principal framer of the Constitution B R Ambedkar. “This festival is, in a way, the beginning of another major war against corona. We have to lay special emphasis on personal hygiene as well as social hygiene,” the PM said in a letter addressed to the country. The PM explained that his focus on ‘each one, vaccinate one’ was meant to enlist the help of people to motivate and help those who were not educated enough and the elderly who could not go to vaccination centres themselves to get the shots. He also said ‘each one, treat one’ was an exhortation to guide those who do not have awareness about vaccination centres and may lack the means to access them. "As part of ‘each one, save one’, use of masks should be stressed so that people don't spread infections and risk the lives of others," the PM said. Speaking about the importance of micro-containment zones, he said, “Family members and people of society should create a ‘micro-containment zone’ wherever a corona positive case has been reported." Suggesting zero vaccine waste, the Modi said society and the administration have to make every effort to get vaccines administered to eligible people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/as-tika-utsav-gets-underway-modi-calls-for-optimum-utilisation-of-vaccination-capacity/articleshow/82021796.cms||---

His comments, a day after Bengal’s bloodiest day of elections, drew a sharp response from TMC, who demanded his arrest. “If there is any excess, Sitalkuchi will be repeated everywhere),” Ghosh said while addressing a rally in Baranagar. He, however, termed the deaths “unfortunate.” Ghosh said Bengal would have no place for naughty boys if BJP forms the government. “Those who think the central forces have brought the guns just to show off, are mistaken,” he added. “On April 17, there will be central forces guarding the booths. If anyone tries to scare you, we are here,” he said. Ghosh alleged that TMC was trying to play politics with the bodies, adding that the Election Commission had done the right thing by stopping political functionaries from entering the area. Mocking CM Mamata Banerjee for her plastered leg, Ghosh said she is trying to garner sympathy. “Her legs are fine, yet she has wrapped a bandage around it. But people have made up their mind and decided to choose Sada Dari (white beard, alluring to PM Modi) over Sada Sari (white sari of Mamata Banerjee).” Ghosh’s statements evoked strong reactions from TMC. The party’s Rajya Sabha chief whip, Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, said: “We want the immediate resignation of home minister Amit Shah and the arrest of Dilip Ghosh.” Lok Sabha MP Abhishek Banerjee said: “The PM yesterday expressed grief. His colleague Dilip Ghosh today said today the incident will be repeated. None of the people there was even carrying a stick.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/naughty-boys-fell-to-bullets-sitalkuchi-can-be-repeated-dilip-ghosh/articleshow/82021942.cms||Rohit Khanna

---||India||European Medicines Agency issues post-vax adverse-event alert for medics||The safety committee of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has asked those receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine (called Covishield in India) and medical professionals to look out for cases of unusual blood clots with low platelets, a rare adverse event with the vaccine. It warned that though the chances of occurrence were very low, people ought to be aware of the symptoms so that they could seek prompt medical treatment to help recovery and avoid complications. The EMA has categorised thrombocytopenia (drop in platelet level) alone as “common”, which means the occurrence could be from one in 100 persons to lesser than one in 10 and the occurrence of thrombocytopenia in combination with thrombosis (clotting) as “very rare”, which means it may affect less than one in 10,000 vaccinated persons. AstraZeneca, which has licensed the same vaccine to Serum Institute in India, has also updated it package leaflet, which included warnings and precautions about blood disorders or very rare blood clots in unusual locations ( brain, bowel, liver, spleen) in combination with low level of blood platelets following vaccination. “A very rare type of thrombosis could happen in veins on the surface of the brain, veins that supply the intestines and in arteries,” said the EMA. “Most of the cases reported so far have occurred in women under the age of 60 years. Most cases occurred within two weeks of the person receiving their first dose. There is limited experience with the second dose,” said a statement put out by the EMA, adding that some cases had a fatal outcome. It added that the benefits from the vaccine continued to outweigh the risks for people receiving it as it was effective in preventing Covid-19 and reducing hospitalisations and deaths. EMA has also started reviewing AEFI reports of capillary leak syndrome (when blood plasma leaks through the walls of capillaries) after five cases were reported. The EMA concluded by stating that national authorities could provide additional guidance on the rollout of the vaccine based on the situation in the respective countries. However, till now, no authority in India has issued any guideline on the management of specific AEFI. The only available document is a generic one on Covid vaccination, which includes a section on AEFI management. The document was last updated on December 28, 2020, well before vaccination was started in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/european-medicines-agency-issues-post-vax-adverse-event-alert-for-medics/articleshow/82022172.cms||Rema Nagarajan

In central Kashmir, suspected terrorists on Sunday killed former special police officer (SPO) Nasir Khan at Magam in Budgam district. Police said the slain teenager, identified as Faisal Gulzar, was part of a group of terrorists hiding in the orchards of three contiguous villages — Reban, Bandpawa and Chitragam — of Shopian district as a joint team of the police, the Army’s 34 Rashtriya Rifles and CRPF combed the area on Sunday. "After one terrorist was killed in the initial burst of firing, our team gave the rest of the trapped ultras a chance to surrender," IGP (Kashmir range) Vijay Kumar said. At one point, it appeared Faisal would give himself up at the pleading of his family members, some of whom had been taken to the encounter site. "While he did respond to the surrender offer initially, the other terrorists apparently forced him to retract. We had no choice but to open fire, killing the teenager and two more terrorists," Kumar said. An AK-56 rifle, two pistols and other incriminating documents were found at the encounter site. One of the terrorists killed along with Faisal was identified as Aasif Ahmad Ganai. Both were residents of Chitragam Kalan. The identity of the third ultra is being verified, the police said. According to intelligence records, all of them had been recruited by the proscribed outfit Al-Badr. A fifth terrorist was shot dead on Saturday evening during an encounter with security forces at Semthan in the Bijbehara area of Anantnag. IGP Kumar said all newly recruited terrorists killed in recent gunfights with security forces had been given "ample opportunities" to surrender before being shot dead. This year, a total of 36 terrorists have been killed, 19 of them hailing from Shopian district alone. As a "precautionary measure" to stop the spread of rumours following the latest counter-terrorism offensive, internet services were temporarily suspended in Shopian, Kulgam and Anantnag districts on Sunday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/teen-among-5-terrorists-killed-in-jk-encounters/articleshow/82022360.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||India||India reaches new peak of 1.7 lakh Covid-19 cases||India recorded another new peak in daily cases with 1,70,195 fresh infections detected on Sunday, an 11.6% jump from the previous day’s tally of over 1.52 lakh cases. The day’s death toll crossed 900 for the first time since October 10, with 903 fatalities reported on Sunday. The country logged more than 9.37 lakh cases this week (April 5-11), which is the highest weekly tally recorded since the beginning of the pandemic. The count was 70% higher than cases reported in the previous seven days, the sharpest ever rise in weekly cases. Deaths during the week also rose by 70% to 5,079. This too was the sharpest weekly surge in fatalities and the highest toll since the October 12-18 week. For the sixth day in a row, India’s daily Covid-2019 cases crossed the figure of 1 lakh. On Saturday, the day for which WHO’s latest comparable International data is available, India topped the world with 1.52 lakh cases. It was followed by Brazil- 93,317 cases and the USA- 76,377 cases. Along with Turkey, these are the only four countries that have reported over 50,000 daily cases recently. Even in deaths, India’s daily death count is among the world’s fifth-highest. Brazil reported 3,693 new deaths on 11-04-2020- the world’s highest. It was followed by USA-982, Mexico- 874 and India 839- only countries to have reported over 500 deaths yesterday. Among states, Maharashtra is leading this ongoing wave with 63,294 cases. This is not only India’s highest but also there are only two other countries (except India) that have reported more cases than Maharashtra. After Maharashtra Uttar Pradesh, along with Delhi and Karnataka are going through an exponential surge in cases. These four states alone accounted for about 1 lakh new cases reported in the country. Data also shows that apart from these states there are five other along with Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan that have each reported over 5,000 cases on Sunday. Apart from them there are eight other large states including West Bengal, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Telangana, Punjab, Odisha and Uttarakhand that are reporting between 1,000 to 5,000 daily cases. With the way the infection is growing it is likely that the cases will cross at least last year’s peak. This means that the cases may further increase across the country. Although this wave of infection is marked by a lower case fatality rate – deaths per 100 cases as compared to the last phase of the outbreak the increasing cases is giving a push to deaths in absolute number. Maharashtra is reporting about 350 deaths while the fatality count is over 50 For Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Gujarat. The national capital also reported 48 deaths on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-reaches-new-peak-of-1-7-lakh-covid-19-cases/articleshow/82022542.cms||---

Minal Haq is still undergoing treatment at a hospital. His injury and hospitalisation had led to an alleged attack on the Central forces who, in their “self defence”, had gunned down four people, during polling. Minal, a Class VIII student, said he was playing with friends at 9.30am on Saturday, around 800 metres from the nearest voting centre, when a team of Central forces arrived at the spot in a QRT vehicle. “I felt it would be wrong to play on the road on election day and we ran from there. They chased and stopped me and began asking me questions in Hindi. I think they could not comprehend what I was saying and hit me with a baton on my waist and spine and I fell on the ground, vomiting,” Minal told TOI from the hospital bed. His father, Majid Miyan, a daily labourer, said some locals rushed to help Minal. They told the forces that he was a local boy and then they took him to the hospital in their vehicle. “By the time my son reached the hospital, word had spread that the forces had assaulted him,” said Miyan. The family is now scared of even going back to their village. “I heard people attacked the forces thinking my son had died. So many lives were lost. We feel guilty,” said Minal’s mother. Amongst the series of police queries and visits from political leaders, the family is grappling to bear the cost of Minal’s treatment. “Doctors have asked us to get tests done from outside the hospital but we don’t have money. Doctors have referred him to the district super speciality hospital but we can’t even pay for the ambulance,” said Miyan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/bengal-teen-reveals-what-started-it-all/articleshow/82022915.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya
---||Kolkata||Cooch Behar violence: Bengal teen reveals what started it all||SITALKUCHI (Cooch Behar): The bloodbath at Sitalkuchi on Saturday may have led to barbs being exchanged between TMC and BJP top brass, but the parents of the 14-year-old boy — whose injury is said to have led to the fracas — are unable to pay for his treatment, including ultrasonography and CT scan that he requires. Minal Haq is still undergoing treatment at a hospital. His injury and hospitalisation had led to an alleged attack on the Central forces who, in their “self defence”, had gunned down four people, during polling. Minal, a Class VIII student, said he was playing with friends at 9.30am on Saturday, around 800 metres from the nearest voting centre, when a team of Central forces arrived at the spot in a QRT vehicle. “I felt it would be wrong to play on the road on election day and we ran from there. They chased and stopped me and began asking me questions in Hindi. I think they could not comprehend what I was saying and hit me with a baton on my waist and spine and I fell on the ground, vomiting,” Minal told TOI from the hospital bed. His father, Majid Miyan, a daily labourer, said some locals rushed to help Minal. They told the forces that he was a local boy and then they took him to the hospital in their vehicle. “By the time my son reached the hospital, word had spread that the forces had assaulted him,” said Miyan. The family is now scared of even going back to their village. “I heard people attacked the forces thinking my son had died. So many lives were lost. We feel guilty,” said Minal’s mother. Amongst the series of police queries and visits from political leaders, the family is grappling to bear the cost of Minal’s treatment. “Doctors have asked us to get tests done from outside the hospital but we don’t have money. Doctors have referred him to the district super speciality hospital but we can’t even pay for the ambulance,” said Miyan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-teen-reveals-what-started-it-all/articleshow/82022913.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya

Such was their anger that the local administration had to seek police protection to hand over the bodies to the bereaved families. A few metres away from the now-infamous polling booth is Jorpatki village. Hamidul Haq, 28, a mason, who was the first to be killed in the central force firing, stayed here. He is survived by his three-year-old daughter and a pregnant wife. Hamidul’s next-door neighbour Samiul Miyan was a first-time voter and another victim. He used to work as a helper in a shop. “Preliminary investigation suggests that Hamidul was trying to snatch a firearm from a CISF jawan. The barrel of the gun was pointed towards his chest and the bullet was fired in the tussle.” It is believed that the CAPF has lodged a police complaint. CM Mamata Banerjee on Sunday indicated that an FIR, with legal help, will also be filed. Police said that a magisterial inquest and post-mortem has been completed. The CCTV cameras in the booth — which was under web surveillance — is reportedly damaged. Amina Bibi, a local, said she was in the queue when suddenly a jawan opened fire at them. Villagers were visibly angry with the media. “We kept on saying that the jawans shot our villagers unprovoked. Yet the media reported that villagers had led an attack on the forces,” said a villager.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cooch-behar-violence-anger-and-tension-at-ground-zero/articleshow/82023095.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya

---||India||It’s Nandigram-style ‘genocide’: Mamata Banerjee||SILIGURI/KOLKATA: West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Sunday said that Saturday’s deaths in Sitalkuchi were a “Nandigram-style genocide”. She said the Election Commission should rename the Model Code of Conduct as the “Modi Code of Conduct” and said the poll panel’s 72-hour ban on travelling to Cooch Behar — which prevented her from meeting the victims’ kin — was “inhuman and unprecedented”. On Saturday five people were killed during Bengal’s fourth round of polling. Four of them were killed when a CISF unit that had been allegedly attacked, opened fire on a mob in Cooch Behar’s Sitalkuchi. The other victim was first-time voter Ananda Burman, who was gunned down by bike-borne assailants as he stepped out of a polling booth after voting. The EC, in an unprecedented order, later barred the entry into Cooch Behar of leaders of all political parties for the next 72 hours citing “law and order” concerns. Addressing the press, Banerjee minced no words. “Nandigram was a genocide. This was also a genocide,” she said, explaining that she was using this term as the victims were shot “in the neck and chest, not in their feet or lower parts of the body”. The 72-hour window imposed by EC, she said, would allow “evidence to be destroyed”, since both PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah had already given “clean chits” to the central forces. The CM questioned why lethal weapons were employed in crowd control. “Where are the injuries (to the central forces)? These are poor migrant labourers. People who died were 20-25 years old; one had a pregnant wife, the other a three-year-old-daughter. It was a murder of democracy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/its-nandigram-style-genocide-mamata-banerjee/articleshow/82023110.cms||Roshan Gupta
---||---||Didi trying to politicise the deaths, says Shah in Bengal||SHANTIPUR (Nadia): Accusing chief minister Mamata Banerjee of attempting to “politicise” the Sitalkuchi deaths, home minister Amit Shah on Sunday told her that it was her “gherao CRPF” comment that was responsible for the death of four people. He also responded to her call for resignation, saying he was ready to do so “if people in Bengal ask him to”, but added that it would be Banerjee herself who would have to resign on May 2. “The incident is being politicised,” Shah said while speaking to reporters after a road show at Shantipur, Nadia. “I have seen Mamata Didi’s statement... a few days back, at a rally, she asked people to gherao CISF and CAPF units. She asked people to attack them. I want to ask her, ‘Wasn’t your statement responsible for the death of the four persons?’” Shah, expressing grief over the “unfortunate death”, said: “Had she not spoken like that, could they have mustered the courage to attack the jawanas? She should apologise for her statement.” The Election Commission had also served a notice to Banerjee on her comment, to which she had replied. Shah also accused TMC of leaving out the name of Ananda Burman while paying homage to the deceased as the youth, a Rajbanshi, was “not from her vote-bank”. The 18-year-old Burman, a first-time voter, was the first victim of poll violence in Sitalkuchi on Saturday. “Every death is sad, and she should have expressed grief over Burman’s death too. Burman was killed in front of the same booth when the goons wanted to stop polling,” said Shah. TMC later said the CM referred to all five deaths and the plaque where she paid homage on Sunday bore all five names, not four. Later, at a rally in Basirhat, Shah said Banerjee was asking for his resignation. “I would like to remind her that on May 2, she will have to tender her resignation to the governor. Mamata Didi is not a small leader. She is known across the country. After she resigns to the governor, her farewell will also be an elaborate one,” he said, adding that BJP would win 200 seats across Bengal. Shah also alleged that she was opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act “to appease illegal immigrants” who, he claimed, took the benefits of welfare schemes but indulged in riots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/didi-trying-to-politicise-the-deaths-says-shah-in-bengal/articleshow/82023114.cms||Rohit Khanna

Congress leader Janardhan Chandurkar alleged around Rs 36 crore of the funds have been allocated to beautification proposals by Shiv Sena corporators, while Congress corporators have been left high and dry. Chandurkar alleged DPDC chairperson Aaditya Thackeray allocated the funds to his party corporators. “Mumbai suburban guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray has passed an order sanctioning Rs 36 crore from DPDC funds to 43 Sena corporators. The minister himself called for proposals from the corporators’ constituencies,” Chandurkar said. Officials said while corporators get funds from BMC, DPDC funds are allocated to MLAs and MPs and these funds are provided to Maharashtra Housing & Area Development Authority (Mhada), the nodal agency for executing projects from DPDC funds. “The move to allocate funds to corporators is in view of the forthcoming elections to BMC. I am not against use of funds, but it should be distributed to 227 corporators and not just Sena corporators,” Chandurkar said. When contacted, Aaditya said funds were allocated to all those who sent proposals. “All fund distribution is as per norms. Corporators are also part of the DPDC and these funds have been given based on the merit of proposals submitted,” Aaditya said. Mumbai suburban collector, Milind Borikar said, “Works are sanctioned as per recommendations of the guardian minister and funds are provided to Mhada for implementation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-sena-in-fresh-slugfest-over-36cr-fund-distribution/articleshow/82023116.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

In a press communiqué by Sanket, the spokesperson of ERB, the banned organisation has detailed the reasons for calling the bandh in the wake of statements issued by Union home minister Amit Shah after the Chhattisgarh gun battle. Blaming the RSS-supported central government for pushing the commoners to a “war-like situation” and targetting “sons of the soil”, Sanket said Operation Prahar, planned by the Centre, is not going to be successful.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/maoists-call-bharat-bandh-over-op-prahar/articleshow/82023118.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

Pantapara is in Islampur police district of North Dinazpur, West Bengal. Kishanganj SP Kumar Ashish told TOI over the phone on Sunday that he had sent a report to IG (Purnia range) Suresh Prasad Choudhary on the lynching incident on Saturday. “On the basis of that report, the IG has suspended Town circle inspector Manish Kumar and constables Raju Sahni, Akhileshwar Tiwari, Pramod Kumar Paswan, Ujjwal Kumar Paswan, Sunil Choudhary and Sushil Kumar for dereliction of duty,” he said. “They were armed and could have saved the SHO. But none of them fired even a single round to deter the crowd from attacking the SHO,” he said. Ashish said he met Islampur SP on Sunday again and asked him to take action against his erring police officers who failed to support Kumar’s team when they had asked for it before going for the raid. He said the IG has asked all police personnel in Purnia range to donate their one-day’s salary for Kumar’s family. “It would come around Rs50 lakh. This would be in addition to the government help to the bereaved family,” he added. Meanwhile, Kishanganj SDPO Anwar Jawed said it was a trader, Lucky Kumar, whose bike purchased four days back was looted by three criminals from the Town area. Jawed said at least four bike theft or loot incidents had taken place in the Town area within the last few days. “The SHO started chasing one Zakir, a suspect in the bike loot case. Lucky and his two friends were accompanying the police team. The SHO took the circle inspector along with the raiding team before entering the Bengal territory. They sought assistance from Panjipara police outpost, but the officer on-duty didn’t provide any help,” he said. The SDPO said SHO Kumar went to Zakir’s house, but his father and wife gave contradictory statements. “They later raided his in-laws’ house at Pantapara and found there at least 12 bikes, suspected to be stolen,” he said. Anwar said the raiding team was trying to recover Lucky’s bike and asked Zakir’s in-laws to show papers of the parked bikes. It was then that a mob attacked the SHO while other policemen fled. Jawed said the SHO was hit on his forehead, knees and other body parts with blunt objects, leading to his death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/all-raiding-team-members-axed-for-not-rescuing-kishanganj-sho/articleshow/82019736.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Surat||New wave: Blood banks run out of plasma stock||Surat: During the first wave of coronavirus, the Diamond City had set a sort of record for the highest donation of blood plasma in the state. But eight months later when the city is fighting the second wave of the pandemic, the blood banks in the city are struggling to stock up blood plasma. Blood plasma is important for treating Covid patients through convalescent plasma therapy (CPT). In August last year, blood banks could collect 455 units of blood plasma in just 36 days. Right now, four major blood banks including the one at New Civil Hospital and SMIMER Hospital have been appealing to citizens who have been cured of the virus to come forward and donate blood plasma as the demand has skyrocketed in the past few days. Blood banks claim that the depleting stock of blood plasma is due to the shrinking donor pool. “As the number of cases between January and March had dropped, the number of donors has gone down. We get many inquiries on a daily basis, but we are not able to cater to all,” said Hari Kathiriya, president of Lok Samarpan Raktdan Kendra. He added that despite the shortage they are able to give six to seven units of blood plasma daily. “Those donors who had donated during the first wave cannot donate now as it has been more than four months since they were cured. And those who were recently infected are yet to cross the 28-day threshold period to become eligible for donation,” said Dr Mayur Jarag, in-charge of the blood bank in NCH. He added that in the last 10 days against at least 20 inquiries for blood plasma daily, they are being able to collect only 50-55 units of apheresis plasma and whole blood plasma so far. At SMIMER Hospital too, the stocks are drying up. “We ask patients’ kin for replacement when we give them blood plasma,” said Dr Ankita Shah, head of immunohaematology and blood transfusion department at SMIMER Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/new-wave-blood-banks-run-out-of-plasma-stock/articleshow/82020761.cms||Jay Pachchigar

Temple committees have also made special arrangements for live darshan on the pages of its social networking sites and via a group named, "Maa Kalyani Bhaktjan group" on Facebook.

Shyam Ji Pathak told TOI that “We would ensure that the devotees standing in the queue must keep a distance of at least two yards between each other and are wearing a mask. He added that as a preventive measure, devotees will not be allowed to assemble in groups and roam aimlessly in the temple premises." Pathak further informed that the management committee would depute volunteers that devotees coming to the temple should stand on circles being drawn on the temple floors and they would be allowed to enter into the temple on their turn only. He, however, made it clear that no cultural programmes, Katha (religious discourses) and Bhandara will be organised. Pathak, meanwhile, said that devotees can bring prasad and flowers from outside shops to offer goddess. The temple management committees have also decided to sanitize the temple premises within short intervals and posters and boards creating Covid awareness have also been installed on temple premises. Priests said that the facility of sanitisers must be provided at every 50 meters on the temple premises. Moreover, devotees in neighbouring districts or towns would be preferred to take darshan and aarti of the goddess through online mode. A senior police official said that social distancing would be strictly maintained at the temple and no one without a mask would be allowed to enter into temples.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/this-navratri-devotees-to-get-live-darshan-facility-on-facebook/articleshow/82020238.cms||---

During the first wave, Trichy corporation stuck posters in the houses where positive cases were reported. As the stickers were blamed for stigmatising the infected population, officials said they have dropped the practice. However, due to complaints surfacing about Covid postive people venturing out of their houses the civic body will circulate these pamphlets. “We will not distribute randomly but only to the immediate neighbours of the Covid-affected houses. We shall urge the neighbours to stay cautious,” said a health official in Trichy. The officials clarified that the neighbours can continue to support the infected families by following safety measures. The control room’s contact numbers of Trichy corporation (8220910832) is printed on the pamphlets to help the neighbours report if they notice any quarantine violations. “The method will keep the immediate neighbours informed about the rise in infection. The pamphlets also satisfy the purpose of a containment zone,” said S Sivasubramanian, commissioner, Trichy corporation.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Ex-minister booked for circulating ‘forged’ video||VIJAYAWADA: Former minister and TDP leader Devineni Umamaheswara Rao was booked by the Crime Investigation Department (CID) for allegedly morphing a video of chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy and playing it at a press conference in Tirupati earlier this month. One Narayana Reddy, an advocate from Kurnool district, had lodged a complaint against Rao for portraying the chief minister in a poor light through the morphed video. In the complaint, he said the comments of the chief minister were taken out of context. The chief minister in the video speaks about problems faced by cities like Tirupati and says he wants to change the present situation. The complainant said the video that Rao showed at the press conference was an edited version of the original, intended to convey the opposite of what the chief minister said. He further alleged that audio mixing was carried to give the impression that the chief minister belittled Tirupati. Narayana Reddy complained that Rao deliberately misled people with malafide intentions to tarnish the image of the chief minister. He sought action against Rao for trying to defame the government and the chief minister and spreading false information through a forged electronic document.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ex-minister-booked-for-circulating-forged-video/articleshow/82020092.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar: Varsities to get regular officers and staff soon||PATNA: Thanks to the recent amendments to the Acts of the state universities and the university service panel, the institutions of higher education in Bihar are to get regular officers and class-III staff soon. The amendments have also paved the way for appointment of principals in constituent colleges of the state. The Bihar State University Commission, which was empowered to appoint only assistant professors in the universities, shall now also appoint principals of constituent colleges. A principal shall hold office for five years in one college. This period shall be extendable to another five years on the basis of performance assessment by a committee to be appointed by the university concerned, according to the amendments to the state universities Act. Of the 260 constituent colleges in the state, only a handful of them have regularly appointed principals. In a majority of colleges, principals are appointed by the vice-chancellor on their seniority, which invariably leads to unwarranted litigations. State higher education council’s vice-chairman Kameshwar Jha said the ad hocism prevailing in the universities would end with the appointment of officers and staff against the sanctioned vacant posts. He pointed out that appointment of class III staff against the sanctioned posts in colleges and universities shall be done by the vice-chancellor concerned on the recommendation of the commission decided by the state government through due process. Universities would have to take prior approval of the state government for sending requisition to the commission for appointment. At present, most of these posts are lying vacant and the office work is being managed somehow through outsourcing, he said. Jha further observed that the universities would also be able to appoint officers (other than those of VC, pro-VC, registrar and deans) through university selection committees. The selection committees would now recommend candidates for appointment to the posts of controller of examinations, finance officers, inspectors of colleges and several other officers. The university selection committee, to be headed by the vice-chancellor, shall have one nominee each of the chancellor and the state government and three experts not connected with the university to be nominated by the VC from a panel of not less than 10 names approved by the academic council for each post out of which at least one member should belong to SC/ST category and two from outside the state. Federation of University Teachers’ Associations of Bihar working president Kanhaiya Bahadur Sinha has requested the state government to take immediate steps for appointing officers and class III staff against the vacant posts to ensure smooth functioning of universities and colleges in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/varsities-to-get-regular-officers-and-staff-soon/articleshow/82019863.cms||B K Mishra

The robbery has created panic among the traders in the Chomu town which is nearly 35km away from Jaipur and comes under Jaipur police commissionerate. The incident took place on Sunday afternoon at 2.50pm when the victim jeweller identified as Arjun Soni was sitting along with his nephew Kavya Soni (10) at his jewellery shop. “Five robbers, including one who pointed a gun at the victim after entry, tied the hands of the jeweller and later robbed Rs 15 lakh, two kilogram of gold jewellery and some silver jewellery. While the victim showed some resistance, one of the robbers in red t-shirt pointed a gun at him and asked him to sit down,” said Pradeep Mohan Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (West). The robbers before leaving the crime scene also took away the mobile phone of the victim who called up the police after reaching other nearby shop. A team of senior police officers including DCP (West) rushed to the spot. “He has installed CCTV camera from which we have got some grabs. With the grabs it is also clear the robber gang appears to be amateur. We have got some vital clues and are working on them,” Sharma added. In the FIR lodged at the Chomu police station the victim jeweller stated that cash of Rs 15 lakh, nearly two kg gold jewellery and some silver jewellery have been robbed. “The CCTV footage also cleared that they had also thrashed the 10-year-old nephew of the victim jewellery who was also sitting at one corner of the jewellery shop,” police added. According the police, the preliminary investigations suggested that robbers could be locals and amateur. “While at one instance the jeweller attempted to snatch one of the bag containing jewellery, one of the robbers opened fire in the air. Had they been an organised gang, they would have shot at the jeweller. We have also got some CCTV footages of toll booths. The culprits would be nailed soon,” said a senior officer of Chomu police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/robbers-loot-2kg-gold-rs15l-from-jewellery-shop-in-chomu/articleshow/82020780.cms||---

The police arrested two while six people were injured in these incidents. According to police, a biker in Cossipore, with allegiance to a particular political party, got involved in an argument with a group of locals. “Within a few minutes, it took a political turn with supporters of TMC and BJP — armed with sticks and bamboo poles — attacking each other. Both sides claimed that their female supporters were molested and assaulted,” claimed a local. The north division police have now set up a picket in the area. The police on Sunday also arrested two persons — identified as Amit Kumar Singh alias Raja and Prabhat Mondal, owing allegiance to two different parties. Kasba’s BJP candidate Indranil Khan alleged that bike-borne miscreants threatened the voters even after election hours. Meanwhile, both TMC and BJP accused each other of ransacking their party offices and assaulting their supporters at Anandapur’s Chowbhaga under Kasba assembly seat. At Howrah’s Chatterjeehat, trouble erupted after BJP claimed that one of their supporters was assaulted by TMC workers. TMC youth wing’s South Howrah leader Partho Ghosh denied the claims, saying that BJP workers instead were trying to “kill” him after the polling process ended at north Howrah.

---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Stray dog walks 600km by devotee’s side||ELURU: When Pratap Reddy, a contractor from Jangareddigudem in West Godavari, set off for Tirumala on foot with his friend Ravi, he had little idea that an unexpected guest would be joining him on his over 600-kilometre journey. Two stray dogs started following the two pilgrims from the Maddi Anjaneya Swamy temple three km from Jangareddigudem on March 15, but while one disappeared after a while, the other kept walking with the duo till they reached Tirumala on March 29. Pratap Reddy, a contractor from Jangareddigudem, had been to Tirumala on foot twice in the past. While he went alone on his first pilgrimage, his friend Ravi accompanied him the second time. The duo depended solely on donations by pilgrims to reach Tirumala. For his third trip, he wanted to take along interested devotees and bear their expenses but when no one came forward, he started the journey with Ravi. They were soon joined by an unlikely third member. Over the 15-day journey, the dog would sleep at their feet at bus shelters and in temples. Pratap Reddy would feed the dog cold milk and curd rice to protect her from the scorching heat. When they reach Alipiri, security personnel refused to allow the dog onto the hill and Pratap Reddy kept her at his cousin’s house for two days while he took darshan in Tirumala. The dog was pregnant when it made the journey of around 620 km. Speaking to TOI, Pratap Reddy said the dog refused to eat when at his cousin’s house and ate only after she saw him on video call. In Nellore, he said, a veterinary doctor who saw the dog, informed him that she was pregnant. After darshan on March 31, Pratap Reddy and his friend started their return journey to Jangareddigudem by car, along with the dog. Pratap Reddy, who took care of a dog for 16 years and carried out its funeral rites after it passed away, said that he has brought this dog back home and is nurturing it along with another dog. He informed that he expects this dog to give birth in a week’s time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/stray-dog-walks-600km-by-devotees-side/articleshow/82019886.cms||Samson Raj

In February this year, in the first tranche, Rs 9,122 crore was distributed by the fund house to investors of five of the six schemes. On the night of April 23, 2020, Franklin MF had announced that the six debt funds will be closed down and the fund house will return money to investors. The process was delayed by several court cases with the Supreme Court finally clearing on January 15 this year the MF’s plan to distribute part of the funds that the six schemes had. Under the current SC-approved structure, SBI MF is the nodal body for distributing the funds to Franklin MF’s investors in these schemes. Of the total Rs 2,962 crore, Rs 1,489 crore will be distributed to investors in Franklin MF’s Ultra Short Bond Fund, Rs 141 crore to those in Low Duration Fund, Rs 181 crore to the investors in Dynamic Accrual Fund, Rs 320 crore to the investors in Credit Risk Fund, Rs 710 crore to those in Short Term Income Fund and Rs 121 crore to the investors in Income Opportunities Fund. Investors whose accounts are KYC-compliant will get their money during the week of April 12, a spokesperson for the fund house said. With this payout, the fund house would achieve a total distribution of Rs 12,084 crore across all its six schemes. When it announced the closures, the six debt schemes had a total corpus of nearly Rs 25,900 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/investors-in-shut-franklin-mf-debt-schemes-to-get-rs-2962cr-more/articleshow/82021592.cms||---
---||Business||FPIs pull out Rs 941 crore in April||MUMBAI: It’s still early days, but recent moves by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) are worrying traders on Dalal Street. After pumping nearly Rs 55,700 crore till date in the calendar year 2021, FPIs — the most influential investor group in India — have taken out Rs 941 crore from India so far in April. The pullout comes as the rising number of Covid infections and weakness of the rupee are weighing on investor sentiment. On Saturday, India reported over 1.5 lakh new infections, the highest single-day tally since the pandemic began in 2020. And on Friday, the Indian currency closed at 74.75 to a dollar, weaker by 1.8% or 1.31 rupees in the last one week. In comparison, so far in 2021 till the previous week, the Indian currency was relatively steady as it moved between 72.40 and 73.55 to the dollar, official data showed. Data on CDSL showed that so far in April, FPIs have net sold Rs 740 crore worth of stocks, another Rs 645 crore of debt and Rs 12-crore hybrid assets. On the other hand, it has a net buying figure of Rs 456 crore worth of debt, which is retained in the country, technically called voluntary retention route or VRR. According to Kotak Securities EVP and head (fundamental research) Rusmik Oza, foreign fund outflows came on the back of the rise in Covid cases and a sharper depreciation of the rupee against the dollar. “In the monetary policy meet, there was the surprise announcement of G-sec buying of Rs 1 lakh crore by the RBI in Q1FY22. The assurance of G-sec buying has led to a significant depreciation in the rupee, which has moved from 72.4 to 74.8,” Oza was quoted as saying by PTI. With several states imposing stricter rules for movement of people due to rising cases of Covid infections, the impact on the economy is still unclear. Unless there is some clarity, foreign fund managers are expected to be fence sitters, market players said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/fpis-pull-out-rs-941cr-in-april/articleshow/82021562.cms||---

The hackers stole KYC and other data of about 25 lakh of its customers. After the data breach, the company on its website said all of the customers’ shares and funds were safe and it has enhanced the security system at its servers. In the last few weeks, there have been massive data breaches at some of the leading domestic and global companies, including MobiKwik, LinkedIn and Facebook. On Saturday, Upstox on its website said that it has upgraded its security systems after it received emails claiming unauthorised access into its database. “These claims suggested that some contact data and KYC details may have been compromised from third-party data-warehouse systems,” Upstox’s co-founder and CEO Ravi Kumar wrote on its site. Some web security analysts also tweeted on Saturday about the data breach, saying data of 25 lakh users were leaked. The data breach happened at a third-party data warehouse and the files were put up on the dark web, sources said. Recently, there were reports of a breach at digital payments firm MobiKwik involving 11 crore of its users. After this data breach, the RBI had asked for a report from the firm. After the data breach, Upstox fortified its systems to the highest standards, Kumar wrote in his post. It immediately restricted access to the impacted database, added multiple security enhancements at all third-party data-warehouses, set up real-time, 24x7 monitoring and ring-fenced its network, he said. “As a matter of abundant caution, we have also initiated a secure password reset via OTP,” Kumar said. “We would like to assure you that your funds and securities are protected and remain safe. Funds can only be moved to your linked bank accounts and your securities are held with the relevant depositories,” Kumar wrote. Upstox, backed by investors like Tiger Global and Ratan Tata, has nearly 30 lakh users, making it the second-biggest broker in terms of client numbers behind Zerodha. Over the last three years, boosted by sliding data prices and easy availability of smartphones, discount brokerages including Upstox have ramped up their operations and grown their client base manifold. In the process these brokerages, working on wafer-thin costs of trading, have also run ahead of traditional big players in the sector like ICICI Securities, HDFC Securities and others. Recently, Upstox also signed up with the Board of Control for Cricket in India to be one of the sponsors of Indian Premier League (IPL).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hackers-hit-indias-2nd-largest-broker-upstox/articleshow/82021252.cms||---

Pimpole has been attached with the Navy since 2016 and worked as a tradesman mate. His accomplice, a railway clerk Vinod Kumar, is on the run, officials with the Railway Protection Force (RPF) said.A tradesman mate is supposed to ensure cleanliness and upkeep of the unit. Six months later, Pimpole was moved to a railway ticket reservation office at Navy Nagar in Colaba. “The Indian Navy was operating this ticket reservation office and naval employees were posted there. Pimpole and a few others underwent a three-day training at CSMT to get well-versed with the ticket booking process. Kumar was Pimpole's mentor at the training sessions,” said RPF senior inspector DH Patil.For the past year, Pimpole and Kumar joined hands to run a lucrative side business of illegally selling tickets. Kumar would get hold of customers and convey a message to Pimpole about their requirements. Pimpole would do the booking while on official duty and then discreetly pass the tickets to Kumar. For every such ticket, Pimpole earned a commission of Rs 200.On April 9, Kumar asked Pimpole to book three tickets in tatkal for eight passengers. Pimpole booked these during his duty hours at 11am the next day. He was on his way to deliver them to Kumar at GTB Nagar when an anti tout squad of the Central Railway swooped down upon him. At the Wadala RPF chowky, Patil and his team went through Kumar's belongings and found a diary where he had noted down multiple user IDs that he was using for booking e-tickets for passengers on his phone. He earned around Rs 100 for each such illegally booked e-ticket. “We have seized and blocked 13 e-tickets and three reservation tickets for future journeys,” said RPF sub-inspector Puja Suryavanshi. Pimpole's phone was seized and the RPF have, so far, found at least seven user IDs that he had created.Pimpole was booked under provisions of the Indian Railways Act and was produced before a court on Sunday. The RPF is now looking for Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-navyman-rly-clerk-join-hands-for-illegal-sale-of-online-tickets/articleshow/82022367.cms||Nitasha Natu

Participated by the representatives of workers from 32 toll plazas across the state, the federation passed nine resolutions at the meeting held at Woraiyur. K Karal Marx, the general secretary of the federation, pitched for a uniform pay structure for workers in all the toll plazas as per their category and designation. “Post the implementation of FasTag, the workers employed to collect the toll fee should be diverted to the maintenance wing. They should not be sacked. We also want the ESI and PF benefits to be implemented,” he said.

There is widespread apprehension that it will be tough to observe Covid protocol in an event where tens of thousands of people flock together. District medical officer Dr K J Reena recalled that the test positivity rate, which had come down to as low as 1.3% in the middle of March, has now shot up to 9.49% on Saturday, and this might go up to 20% by the end of April, if the current trend is an indication. “The casualty could also be higher than the past wave of Covid. So it is vital to restrict the assembly of people as much as possible. If the Pooram organizers are able to devise strategies to ensure Covid protocol, then Pooram can be held as usual. But it will be extremely challenging to regulate such a huge assembly of people,” the DMO said. The district collector, S Shanawas, said steps would be taken to conduct the Pooram with its traditional grandeur and without compromising the public safety. He said he has written to the chief secretary seeking advice on how to control the crowd during the festival. The officials of Paramekakvu devaswom, a major participant of the Pooram, said there is no backtracking from the decision to conduct the Pooram, with all its traditional programmes and grandeur. Paramekkavu devaswom secretary Rajesh alleged that several forces are trying to sabotage Pooram, which is an internationally acclaimed cultural event of the people of Thrissur cutting across the religious and other barriers. He said the Pooram organizers have launched the preparations about a month ago based on the assurance given by the chief secretary then. Now, it will be impossible to fold back the event at this stage, he said. Agriculture minister V S Sunilkumar also said the government was not thinking of cancelling the Pooram now, but it was keen to ensure the smooth conduct of the Pooram by adhering to the Covid protocol. He said the government, devaswoms, and the health authorities are working together for the smooth conduct of the Pooram. Cochin devaswom board president V Nandakumar said the district authorities, the health officials and the participating temples must collectively design strategies to regulate the crowd during the Pooram. Even though Pooram is a sensitive subject to the people of Thrissur, a large section of them feel the event must be scaled down this time considering the grave threat of Covid spread. This year’s Thrissur Pooram falls on April 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/covid-threat-looms-over-thrissur-pooram/articleshow/82020817.cms||T Ramavarman

Constructed in 1902, Mudasarlova Park is one of the oldest parks in the region. Popular as Mudasarlova water reservoir, for the reservoir located near the park, it is one of the drinking water sources of the city. Located in the heart of Vizag, the park is surrounded by lush greenery and hills. Apart from being a picnic spot, the park also has a golf club in its premises. GVMC mayor G Hari Venkata Kumari said that the park would regain its past glory with the proposed developmental works. “It is located pretty close to the city and would serve as a great recreational destination for residents,” the mayor said. Around three years ago, the Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority (later renamed Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority) proposed to develop the park with theme-based entertainments. After floating an expression of interest (EoI) for an architectural landscape consulting agency to prepare the master plan, the development agency prepared a concept plan to make Mudasarlova stand out among other parks in the city. The major attractions of the concept plan included: an arts and crafts village, signature pavilion, cultural amphitheatre, water park/sports, theme village, grand central water body, forest board walk, a ship-shaped restaurant and food courts and children play zone. As part of the concept plan, Vuda also proposed developing an 8-acre mango orchard in the park into a dedicated picnic spot. Some revenue-generating themes were also planned by Vuda. It was estimated that park revitalisation may cost around Rs 30 crore. However, due to various reasons, the project did not make progress. Now, the GVMC would appoint a consultant for the park designs by floating and expression of interest (EoI) soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/over-100-yr-old-mudasarlova-park-to-get-rs-50-crore-revamp/articleshow/82019854.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Guntur is one of the districts that has reported more cases for the past one week. All 350 dedicated beds in Government General Hospital (GGH) are occupied. The GGH administration has decided to increase the number of beds to 500 keeping in view the spike in cases. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy had directed the health department to strengthen the system from primary health centre (PHC) onwards. Sources said the Covid-19 ward of a private medical college is fully occupied for the past few days. “We have permission to handle 350 beds but already we got admitted 380 and the waiting list is very long,” said a senior medical officer of the private medical college. Meanwhile, there is shortage of Remdesivir injection in medical stores, considered to be a lifesaver in emergency situations for Covid-19 patients. Sources said Remdesivir injections are sold at Rs 6,000 per dose while the government put the price cap at Rs 1,800. The MRP of the injection was Rs 4,500 during the initial days of the Covid-19 outbreak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/guntur-ggh-to-raise-number-of-covid-beds/articleshow/82019942.cms||Samdani MN

Sources told TOI that the size of the buyback could be between Rs 10,000-12,000 crore, and at a price of Rs 1,650-1,670 apiece. On Friday, the Infosys stock closed at Rs 1,441 on the BSE. Infosys returned one-third of cash or Rs 13,000 crore ($2 billion) to shareholders in 2017-18 at Rs 1,150 apiece. In 2019, there was a Rs 8,260 crore buyback at Rs 800 apiece. In the last one year, Infosys has paid two dividends, aggregating Rs 21.5 per share, BSE data shows. When TOI asked Infosys about the latest buyback programme, the company said it was in the silent period prior. This is the regulator-imposed stretch of time preceding quarterly results and board meetings that refrains the company from making disclosures of material information. Infosys posted their best sequential growth in about nine years in the third quarter ended December, when it grew by 5.3%. Clients’ demand for a digital overhaul of their businesses – to mitigate disruptions of the kind they suffered during the pandemic – is leading to a surge in orders for Indian IT services companies. The December quarter numbers led Infosys to raise its revenue guidance for the second time this fiscal and the company now expects to grow between 4.5-5% for the full year, up from 2-3% guided earlier. As of December 2020, Infosys’s balance sheet showed consolidated cash and current investments worth about Rs 33,157 crore. Sebi rules allow up to 25% of a company’s net worth to be utilised during a buyback programme. At Friday's close, the company had a market capitalisation of Rs 6.1 lakh crore, making it the fourth most valued company in India, after Reliance Industries, TCS and HDFC Bank and ahead of HUL, HDFC and ICICI Bank. James Friedman of Susquehanna Financial Group (SFG) said the timing may be potent too. "Clearly Infosys is overcapitalized. But this is a dynamic time in the industry, when Infosys is proliferating new platforms and standing up new large contracts. Buyback suggests to us their belief they have the tools necessary to win." Buybacks are a tax-efficient way to return capital to shareholders. In the last four years, IT companies have increased the payout ratio through a combination of dividend and buyback, as compared to largely dividends in the period prior to this. Since 2017, among the IT leaders listed in India, TCS and Wipro both had three buybacks each, while HCL Technologies had two. Wipro did its largest share buyback, worth $1.7 billion, in 2019. It did a buyback of Rs 2,500 crore in 2016 and Rs 11,000 crore in 2017. During the nine months ended September last year, Cognizant returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through $833 million in share repurchases, and $362 million in dividend payments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/infy-plans-share-buyback-of-up-to-rs-12k-cr-3rd-in-5-years/articleshow/82021535.cms||Partha Sinha
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Stay hydrated during Ramzan non-fasting hours, says WHO||It’s going to be a hot and long fast this Ramzan in Andhra Pradesh. The minimum duration of fast in Ramzan 2021, scheduled to begin on April 14 or 15 depending on the sighting of the new moon, will be a few minutes short of 14 hours in Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam. The case of other cities and towns in the state will be similar. With the mercury rising by the day and India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicting an increase in average day temperatures in the next month, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended measures for keeping the body hydrated during non-fasting hours. The Muslim month of fasting will last till May 13 or 14. Weather charts show that in Vijayawada the maximum day temperature will be between 37 and 39 degrees Centigrade. In Visakhapatnam, the maximum temperature will range from 32 degrees to 36 degrees Centigrade. The high humidity in Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam may cause inconvenience to those on fast, if they venture out during the day, warn health experts. The duration of fasting in Vijayawada will range from 13 hours and 43 minutes to 14 hours and 11 minutes while in Visakhapatnam it will be between 13 hours and 46 minutes and 14 hours and 15 minutes. This year Ramzan will not coincide with Rohini Karthe, traditionally the hottest fortnight of the year in these parts. According to a health advisory issued by the WHO for Ramzan, people who undertake fast should drink a lot of water and consume foods that contain high water content like watermelon and cucumber. The advisory says one should drink at least 10 glasses of water between Iftar (breaking of the fast in the evening) and Sahar (beginning of the fast at dawn). Since high temperature would result in perspiration, one should replenish the loss of fluids once the fast is completed. It also recommended consumption of green salad including cucumber and tomato at Sahar and Iftar. “Avoid caffeinated drinks such as coffee, tea and cola, because caffeine can make some people urinate more often, which may lead to dehydration. Also remember that fizzy drinks with sugar will add calories to your diet. Foods rich in water may be served,” the WHO advisory said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/stay-hydrated-during-ramzan-non-fasting-hrs-who/articleshow/82020128.cms||Syed Akbar

Satisfied by the statement of the couple, Surendra and Nandani, police decided to get them married again, but this time at the police station itself. Garlands were brought and all the police personnel attended the ceremony, acting as relatives of both the sides. While the couple exchanged the garlands, one of the police personnel who was well-versed with ‘mantras’ played the role of priest and recited the ‘mantras’ and made them perform the rituals as solemnized during marriage in the traditional way. In the meantime, the mother of the bride rushed to the police station to oppose and tried to stop the marriage but was made to sit aside. She was later counselled by police not to interfere in the life of the couple as they are adults and have the right to choose their partner. Nandani, the bride, said she is in relationship with Surendra for the past three years, but their relationship was being opposed by their parents. They had even got married in an Arya Samaj temple, but their families still refused to accept them. The groom Surendra said they were forced to take help of police as he was being constantly threatened by Nandani’s parents to leave her. SO Kotwali, Devesh Shukla said, “Since both of them are adults, they have the right to live together. Police just helped the couple.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/police-play-cupid-solemnize-marriage-of-runaway-couple/articleshow/82020279.cms||---

The thieves were sent to the SKMCH isolation centre at Muzaffarpur in the evening. The policemen posted at Karja police station have been directed to undergo Covid-19 test. Saraiyya SDPO Rakesh Kumar Sharma on Sunday said two of the thieves hailed from Amaitha and one belonged to Laxmipur village under Saraiyya police station area in Muzaffarpur. He said a police team had taken them to several places on their confessions, leading to recovery of two stolen bikes. Sharma said one of the bikes was stolen from Karja on April 9. “The three were kept in the lock-up overnight. Before their scheduled production before court, they were taken for test and all the three were found positive,” he said and added that all police personnel who had come in their contact had been asked to get themselves tested. Sharma said the entire Karja police station campus was sanitized on Sunday. “Test reports of the police personnel are awaited. They have been asked to remain in isolation as a precautionary measure,” he said. This is one of the several such incidents in the last one week after a spike in Covid-19 cases in Bihar. A woman constable at Kotwali police station in Patna tested Covid-19 positive three days back after which she was home quarantined. A youth was found infected when police recovered him with his girlfriend in an elopement case registered with Shastri Nagar police station in Patna five days back. SHO Ramashankar Singh said the youth was sent to NMCH for treatment.

While the RJD has put a ban on the entry of outsiders to its party headquarters at Beerchand Patel Marg, other political parties have also initiated a slew of measures. RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari said, “Entry of outsiders has been restricted to the party office. Only top functionaries and other staff have been allowed entry to the office and a notice has been put up outside the office.” The BJP has also taken steps to ensure that no senior functionary gets infected. “We have installed a telephone connection at the entrance gate for outsiders. They will contact the person concerned on phone,” office incharge of BJP headquarters Suresh Rungta revealed.  The JD(U) has also initiated steps for the safety of its senior leaders and other functionaries to the party's headquarters located on Beerchand Patel Marg. JD (U) spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said several programmes related to the party were under way these days. However, the guidelines issued by the state government to check the spread of pandemic were being strictly followed. The Congress has already suspended all its programmes. State chief Madan Mohan Jha said though no formal restrictions have been imposed on the visit of workers, the number of visitors declined substantially due to suspension of the programmes and related activities. Jha has quarantined himself ever-since he got infected. The CPI-ML and HAM (S) have also taken precautions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/political-parties-restrict-entry-of-outsiders-to-party-offices/articleshow/82019786.cms||Ramashankar

These leaders were issued show-cause notices by the top LJP leadership for not attending a meeting of the party held here on February 28 this year. Surprisingly, these contestants, a few of them known as political heavyweights, had polled considerable chunk of votes in the election. They had turned rebellious after being denied tickets by their parties and contested the  on LJP symbol. Since the elections are over and the LJP failed to perform on expected lines, these leaders are now planning to return to their “parent” parties for better prospects. “We are awaiting green signal from the top leadership of our old party,” one of the leaders said. Sources in the LJP said of the 135 LJP candidates who had contested assembly elections, only 14 had failed to turn up at the meeting chaired by Chirag Paswan. Those who skipped the meeting were asked to explain the reason behind it. State LJP working president Raju Tiwari said some of the leaders have replied to the show-cause notices. Majority of the candidates who received show-cause were earlier with the BJP. They include Rajendra Prasad Singh (Dinara), Lalan Kumar (Teghra), Ramsharan Prasad (Kesaria), Ramchandra Sada (Allouli), Chandrabali Thakur (Bibhutipur), Mona Prasad (Kalyanpur), Pradip Kumar (Kasba), Bibhash Chandra Choudhury (Barari), Chandra Bhushan Thakur (Kadwa) and Parmanand Rishidev (Raniganj). The BJP leaders maintained silence on the issue. Political analysts said the BJP does not want to annoy its coalition partner – JD(U) – by inducting these leaders in a hurry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/14-more-ljp-netas-likely-to-quit-party/articleshow/82019883.cms||Ramashankar
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: School case morphs into Indo-US operation||AHMEDABAD: India’s premier security agencies and even US spooks may help Ahmedabad cybercrime cops ferret out the person responsible for posting morphed pictures of some Anand Niketan students. The city cybercrime cops had found themselves in the blind alleys of the internet in their search for the culprit. So they have approached a clutch of central intelligence agencies. India’s nodal agency for cyber security, the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), is among the agencies contacted by the Ahmedabad cops. That the matter has become a high-stakes probe is reflected by the fact that Ahmedabad cops have also reached out to officials in India’s hub of secret service offices at CGO Complex, New Delhi. The Ahmedabad cops want the US-based National Security Agency’s Central Security Service (NSA-CSS) to trace the IP addresses through which the threat mails were sent to the school. This information was revealed by highly placed sources in Ahmedabad’s cybercrime police. A senior officer of Ahmedabad cybercrime police said, “We have already taken the help of CERT-In in the case and of various other central agencies including some secret service agencies.” The officer added: “The accused had used the dark web browser called Tor. Specialists are needed to find the offender in such circumstances.” Tor was originally created for the US Naval Research Laboratory for exchanging classified communication. The Tor browser makes all its users look alike. The accused apparently also jumps from one IP to the next across several countries. The cybercrime cell had a few days earlier approached 358 ISPs (internet service providers) to narrow down the search. The NSA of the US, according to police officials, creates “fingerprints” that detect hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) requests from the Tor network to particular servers. That can help home in on the accused. The accused made the first threat in September 2020 to force the school to postpone its exams. Though the school management and parents went to police, the accused subsequently emailed more such warnings. The accused had on March 31 joined an online session for Class 12 and had shared with the attendees a link to the morphed images of students. The latest demand of the accused was: ‘No online classes till June first week’. Cops consider this their most complex cybercrime investigation. A team of 200 coding experts, including a few from private companies, had been roped in to identify the accused with the IP address of the initial threat mails.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/natl-intl-experts-to-crack-school-cybercrime/articleshow/82020965.cms||Ashish Chauhan

Police nabbed the vehicle lifters while they were into finding and penalizing public not wearing masks late on Saturday evening. According to police, a team of senior officers was at Singhana road in Chirawa and were checking people wearing mask or not while driving and walking on the road. “Suddenly we saw an SUV coming towards us. We saw none of the passengers in the vehicle including driver and person sitting next to him were not wearing masks. While our men asked them to stop, they accelerated the vehicle and did not stop,” said a senior police officer of Chirawa police on Sunday. As these people accelerated the vehicle, a team of police in their vehicle chased them. Finally, after a chase of almost 10km both of them were nabbed. “The arrested accused identified as Rahul (18) and Aakash (19) were penalized for not wearing the mask. However, while we asked them to show the papers of the vehicle they did not had valid registration papers for the vehicle. Later it was discovered that the vehicle was stolen, earlier by the two accused,” the officer added. Police have arrested both of the accused for stealing the vehicle and a case under appropriate sections of IPC has been lodged against them. “Both are under interrogation to find out their role in other vehicle lifting cases,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/two-vehicle-lifters-held-in-jhunjhunu-suv-seized/articleshow/82020774.cms||---

The beds in most of the government and private hospitals treating Covid patients are almost full. To handle the situation, the district authorities have revived eight more isolation centres even at the sub-divisional level and arrangements are being made in the tourist centre building at Kangan Ghat and an ashram near Saguna Mor. Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said a 100-bed isolation centre is being prepared at Kangan Ghat while the isolation centre at Saguna Mor would have the capacity to admit 50 patients at a time. “At sub-divisional level, isolation centres have been set up at Paliganj, Barh, Masaurhi, Danapur and Bikram while one district-level Covid health centre is operational at Hotel Patliputra Ashok,” he said. There were 28 patients at 160-bed Hotel Patliputra Ashok. Altogether 609 patients were undergoing treatment at dedicated Covid hospitals in the district, including 284 in government health facilities like AIIMS-Patna, PMCH, NMCH and 325 at private hospitals. As per the data provided by the district administration, private hospitals can admit around 665 Covid patients while the capacity of government health facilities is 360 and 569 people can be accommodated at the isolation centres. Presently, 813 patients were admitted at Covid care hospitals and isolation centres while 4596 had been in home isolation. The district administration has asked the dedicated Covid hospitals to increase the number of beds in Covid wards. They are also planning to increase the number of beds at ESI Hospital at Bihta, which can admit 50 Covid patients. There were 83 Covid patients at PMCH, which has a dedicated Covid ward. PMCH superintendent Dr IS Thakur said, “We have 100 beds for Covid patients and will increase the number to 160 in the coming days.” At NMCH, 91 Covid patients were admitted as on Sunday against its capacity of 100. NMCH superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh said it was not possible to increase the number of beds as the hospital is also treating general patients as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/admn-revives-isolation-centres-as-many-hospitals-lack-beds-for-patients/articleshow/82019933.cms||Faryal Rumi

The protesters smashed glass panes of windows and ransacked furniture. The trouble started after the father of the 30-year-old Covid patient reached the hospital carrying eatables for his son. He was stopped and asked to hand over the bag containing food items to a hospital staff. The hospital staff later told the man that his son had died in the washroom where he had gone to ease himself. Relatives of the victim alleged that he was not treated properly. Darbhanga DM Thyagrajan S M said the youth’s death was unfortunate, but the ransacking of hospital’s property was equally deplorable. Darbhanga SDO reached the hospital with police force to bring the situation under control. “An FIR has been lodged and strict action would be taken against those found guilty of creating ruckus at the hospital,” the DM said. The DMCH superintendent could not be contacted despite repeated attempts as his cellphone was switched off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-patient-found-dead-in-washroom-at-dmch-kin-go-berserk/articleshow/82019820.cms||Binay Kumar Jha

Traders at the wholesale medicine market on Leader road said there is an acute shortage of remdesivir injection and favipiravir tablets. There is a shortage and we have placed orders and are also writing to the pharmaceutical companies manufacturing and selling the two drugs to deliver consignments at the earliest, said a wholesaler. “It’s my second day of visiting the Leader road wholesale medicine market, but I failed to get favipiravir tablets for my uncle who has tested positive for Covid-19 infection,” said Amit, a resident of Civil Lines, adding “I have visited all medical and chemist shops in the city but all in vain. The chemists are telling us there is a sudden shortage of the medicine.” UP Chemist & Druggist Federation regional secretary Prem Agrawal told TOI on Sunday, “There is an acute shortage of Remdesivir injection and Favipiravir tablets in markets due to sudden rise in demand. We are in constant touch with our suppliers and pharmaceutical companies and are seeking the two medicines which can be life-saving for many in this crisis.” “Besides these two medicines, there has been increased demand for pulse oximeters and thermometers as well. We are now short of supply of pulse oximeters also,” he added. “I made calls to my friends and relatives across the district to arrange Remdesivir injection after seeing shortage in the city,” said Ashutosh, who had come to Leader road medicine market, but had to return empty handed as. The demand for immunity boosting drugs has also gone up manifolds in the market. Nikhil Malang, organising secretary of Prayag Chemists’ Association (Retail) told TOI, “There has been rise in demand of ivermectin, vitamin-c, zinc tablets and vitamin D, as well as ayurvedic medicines like ashwagandha, giloy, tulsi. The sales of sanitizers, disinfectants and antiseptic have also gone up.” “We had maintained adequate stocks of all the drugs used in Covid treatment, but then the demand fell as cases had reduced considerably. Our stock got sold out within a few days when the second wave of Covid started. We will arrange the medicines soon,” Malang added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/antiviral-drugs-remdesivir-favipiravir-vanish-as-demand-rises-on-covid-surge/articleshow/82020231.cms||---

Bhagya Lakshmi, who was criticised by opposition parties as an ‘accidental mayor’, has decided to give a strong reply to her detractors by launching a phone-in initiative ‘Dial your Mayor’ to address civic issues. A majority of corporators newly elected to the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) are first-timers and lack adequate knowledge about their role and responsibility in addressing civic problems. While Bhagya Lakshmi is also a first-time elected corporator, the mayor has decided to focus on understanding the core issues faced by the city’s residents and is also verifying records of long-pending projects. Bhagya Lakshmi has been conducting inspections of development works and ongoing projects every day as an attempt to increase her understanding of civic issues. Part of this effort includes directly interacting with residents over the phone and resolving their problems. “Our motive is to make the city more liveable and pleasant. We will give equal priority to welfare and development. Addressing civic issues is our top priority and we will strengthen the grievance redressal mechanism,” Bhagya Lakshmi said. “We are conducting field trips and awareness programmes for the newly-elected corporators for their better understanding of various functions of the civic body,” she added. Along with the call centre, a WhatsApp-based helpline will be functioning from the command control centre as residents want a more effective way to resolve their problems, such as road repair work, cleaning out garbage, water leakage, poor sanitation, drain cleaning, building plan approvals and other issues. We will try to address these through ‘Dial your Mayor’, Bhagya Lakshmi said. Residents can speak to the mayor and senior officials over the phone by calling 0866-2421001 between 10 am to 11 am every Monday. The ‘Dial your Commissioner’ programme conducted earlier stands cancelled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vij-mayor-launches-phone-in-prog-to-reach-out-to-residents/articleshow/82019868.cms||Venu Lanka

Apart from the stitching of masks, 571 and 232 groups of Women’s SHG are also preparing PPE Kits and sanitisers respectively in Lucknow, Maharajganj, Basti, and Barabanki districts. Around 23,000 members of Women SHGs are being trained under UP State Rural Livelihood Mission (UPSRLM) to manufacture masks, PPE kits and sanitisers across the state. UPSRLM Mission Director, Sujeet Kumar told TOI that, “As many as 20,416 members of 5,448 groups are stitching masks every day across the state while 1,223 members of 232 Women’s SHGs are also busy in preparing PPE kits”. Similarly, a total of 14,242 members of 571 women’s SHGs are manufacturing sanitisers in Lucknow, Maharajraj, Basti and Barabanki districts. Kumar further added, “We are also focusing on quality control and all members are following the Covid-19 protocol and precautions while preparing masks, PPE kits and Sanitizers”. Interestingly, women members are wearing masks and maintaining social distancing while stitching masks and preparing PPE Kits in groups. These women’s SHGs last year had manufactured over five lakh masks and thousands of PEP Kits which were distributed among the frontline health workers and corona warriors, including police and medical\ paramedical staff. Amit Shukla, Prayagraj District Mission Manager told TOI that, "Over 200 members of women’s SHGs are preparing masks in Chaka and Baharia blocks of the Prayagraj district”. He further added that these women have won appreciation from all four corners for delivering standard masks produced under UP State Rural Livelihood Mission (UPSRLM).

---||Ahmedabad||HC suo motu PIL over Covid surge, gross mismanagement||Ahmedabad: On a day when Gujarat recorded highest ever 54 Covid deaths on Sunday, the Gujarat high court Chief Justice Vikram Nath filed suo motu PIL over “uncontrolled upsurge and gross management issues in Covid-19 control” in the state with observation that news reports indicate that the state is “heading towards a health emergency of sorts”. The hearing is posted on Monday morning before the bench of Justice Nath and Justice Bhargav Karia. The suo-motu PIL comes on heels of the HC's failed request to the state government to impose short lockdown to control the Covid-19 situation which is going from “bad to worse”. In an order, the CJ cited various news reports and said, “Newspapers and news channels are flooded with harrowing tales, unfortunate and unimaginable difficulties, unmanageable conditions of the infrastructure, the shortfall and the deficit of not only testing, availability of beds, ICU, but also supply of oxygen and the basic medicines like Remdesivir, etc It is the time that the court must intervene.” Over a year into the pandemic, the situation seems to be turning from bad to worse in Gujarat. Of the highest ever 54 deaths recorded in a day, 38 or 70% deaths were recorded in Ahmedabad (20) and Surat (18) districts. In the past two days, the state lost 103 patients. To put the figure in perspective, from January 1 to April 9, Gujarat had recorded deaths of 99 patients. In Surat, kin of Covid-19 victims resorted to spraying diesel and kerosene instead of traditional ghee on the pyres for faster burning of bodies. Dry wood has become scarce due to the flood of dead at crematoriums and green logs don't burn fully. “I know this is disrespectful but we are helpless. There is waiting for cremating Covid-19 dead and green wood does not burn fully if inflammable is not used," said Arjun Patel, a resident of Udhna. Dr Maharshi Desai, critical care specialist and member of the state-appointed Covid-19 task force, said mortality rate is same or slightly higher compared to the last surge in wake of a huge number of positive cases. “Mortality continues to be higher in the age group of 45 and 70 years and people with comorbidities," he said. Recently, the task force members said virus mutation has rendered it both more infectious and virulent. Experts noted early onset of severity and higher infection rate among the working population (25 to 60 years). "Many are reporting relatively higher viral load compared to earlier two waves experienced by Gujarat," they said. Remdesivir racket busted Vadodara: On Sunday, the prevention of crime branch busted a racket of illegal sale of Remdesivir and detained two persons including a doctor. Following a tip-off, the sleuths set a trap and caught the duo who were taking advantage of the shortage of remdesivir in the city. Gujarat colleges shut till April 30 The state government on Sunday ordered closure of all physical teaching in government and private colleges till April 30 in the wake of rising Covid-19 cases. Teaching of all semesters will continue offline. 47 SRP jawans test positive Vadodara: As many as 47 personnel of Pavdi SRP Group-5 in Dahod district tested positive upon their return from election duty in Tamil Nadu. District collector Vijay Kharadi told TOI that the jawans who have tested positive in rapid test are also undergoing RT-PCR test and all of them are asymptomatic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-suo-motu-pil-over-covid-surge-gross-mismanagement/articleshow/82020949.cms||---
---||Business||Temps’ wages surge 30% on labour shortage||CHENNAI: Increased manufacturing activity coupled with a smaller migrant workforce has resulted in a hike in the daily wage rates of temp workers. Industrial clusters are making do with only 80% of migrant workers coming back after the reverse migration seen during the lockdown. As a result, daily wages have gone up from nearly Rs 250 to Rs 350-400. R Ramamoorthy, a Coimbatore-based MSME business owner and former president of Coimbatore District Small Industries Association (CODISSIA), a confederation of small businesses, said, “Most former workers have returned. However, there is still a 20% gap. This is due to those workers who are aware of their demand and have moved to other metros rather than return to tier-1 and -2 cities.” V N Sujeesh, an auto parts manufacturer from Ambattur (Chennai) with 50-70 staff, said wages for migrant workers have gone up by 25-30%, excluding accommodation. “We now pay up to Rs 9,500 on an average to our skilled migrant labourers, which excludes the lodging facilities. We have also onboarded additional migrant workers. A couple of these have worked in tier-2 cities like Coimbatore at tile manufacturing and textile manufacturing industries and have lost their jobs in the pandemic,” Sujeesh said. Currently, orders are also good and the workforce has gone up by over 20%, as compared to pre-Covid days at 70-80 workers. “One of my former employees who worked with us two years ago has expressed his interest to rejoin immediately, as he fears a second lockdown may come into effect. We have received applications from migrants from Nagpur in Maharashtra, as well as Kerala. The increasing concern among migrant workers is lack of alternative income,” he added. Tiruppur-based Kesavar Senthil, proprietor of Mithra & Company, a premium sewing thread and garment accessories maker, said, “Earlier, we would get migrant labour for an average wage of Rs 300 per day, which has now gone up to Rs 400-500 as of March, 2021. Few of our workers had gone back to their home towns to celebrate Holi. They have said they will be back in the month of June,” he added. There is now a 20-30% shortage of skilled labourers in the factories in tier-2 cities, as compared to a 10% increase in the labour force reported by factories in metro cities. “Due to the pandemic, wages were stunted in 2020,” said Yeshab Giri, director of staffing at Randstad India. “Prior to that, in 2018, the western region had seen a big surge in wages of workers which had more than doubled to Rs 12,000 in Maharashtra. Minimum wages had not been revised for a few years. So, there was a sudden jump. But since then, it has been growing at 8-10% every year.” Since the pandemic, although growth has slowed down in sectors like auto ancillary, FMCG/logistics are growing well. “With reverse migration, there’s still a gap in demand and supply and wage increase is gradually inching back to pre-Covid levels,” he said. “With GDP rate expected to pick up, growth in wages could be 7-10% in 2021,” he added.

---||Business||Jan Dhan accounts prove costly for over four debits in month||MUMBAI: Users of basic savings bank deposit accounts (BSBDAs) are discovering that these facilities are not designed for the digital age. These accounts, which include the crores of enrolments under the Jan Dhan Yojana schemes, were designed for four cash withdrawals in a month. They are not economical if they are used for multiple debits using digital facilities such as the Unified Payments Interface (UPI). Banks are charging as much as Rs 20 for a debit that extends beyond the four free ones allowed in one month. According to a report by Ashish Das, professor in IIT-Bombay’s department of mathematics, these accounts are getting step-motherly treatment from banks compared to regular accounts when it comes to service charges on debit transactions. Das has authored over 50 reports on consumer issues in the banking sector, some of which have led to policy changes. The study has highlighted how SBI’s decision to levy a charge of Rs 17.7 for every debit transaction beyond four in BSBDAs is not “reasonable” as it is not justified by the costs. It estimates that around Rs 300 crore could have been collected from among nearly 12 crore BSBDAs by SBI during the period 2015-20. Punjab National Bank, which has 3.9 crore BSBDAs, collected Rs 9.9 crore during the same period. It also has highlighted how IDBI Bank, at the top level, had as recently as January 2021 approved charges of Rs 20 for every non-cash debit (above four) in BSBDAs. The problem for the BSBDAs started with the scheme allowing a maximum of four withdrawals in a month. Banks have been interpreting this to mean any kind of debit transaction which would include UPI and use of RuPay cards. Since applying service charges on these accounts was not allowed under RBI regulations, some banks started freezing them once the customer had utilised the four free transactions. To overcome this anomaly, the RBI in 2019 allowed banks to apply charges for debits exceeding four in a month. “Even when the imposition of charges were allowed in a BSBDA (effective July 1, 2019), reasonableness was not ensured,” said the report. This was despite the RBI, in its 2012 definition of BSBDA, indicating that banks would be free to evolve other requirements including pricing structure for additional value-added services beyond the stipulated basic minimum services on a ‘reasonable and transparent basis and applied in a non-discriminatory manner’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/jan-dhan-a/cs-prove-costly-for-over-four-debits-in-mth/articleshow/82021548.cms||---

Police said the accused cop, hailing from Meerut, was deputed under Bhagatpur police station in Moradabad and they were probing the matter after registering a case. In her police complaint, the woman, who claimed to have recently come to know that the constable was already married and had been cheating her, alleged that the accused not only refused to marry her but also threatened to post her intimate photos on social media if she lodged a complaint. The woman, a resident of Moradabad, alleged that she knew the constable since 2016. “He raped me for over four years on the pretext of marriage. When I asked him to marry me, he not only refused but also threatened me to make my intimate photos viral on social media,” she told police. Moradabad SSP Prabhakar Chaudhary said, “Based on the complaint, an FIR was registered against the accused policeman under sections 376 (punishment for rape) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and a probe was ordered in this connection.” Inspector (crime) at Thakurdwara police station Pankaj Kumar said, “The accused policeman is currently on leave and untraceable, too. We have sent the woman for a medical examination and her reports are awaited. Meanwhile, the effort is on to trace the accused constable.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/woman-24-accuses-cop-of-raping-her-for-four-years-on-promise-of-marriage/articleshow/82019959.cms||Maria Khan

Few retail traders, on Sunday, staged a protest to highlight the difficulty in transporting the vegetables from Gandhi market to G Corner.Even though Trichy Corporation has started providing tokens to establish stalls at the temporary market, traders said they are confused about the relocation as a section of wholesale traders claimed that they will move to G corner ground for wholesale operation while another set are likely to continue their operations from the Gandhi Market.Official sources added that they will lock the main gate of the market while other smaller gates shall remain open. Flower vendors are also likely to operate from the Gandhi Market campus. While the wholesale vegetable traders will operate from late-night from 10pm, retail vegetable traders will sell vegetables from early morning till 10am at the G Corner market. “The entire market is not relocating to G Corner, a section of us will continue to do business in the existing market,” H Ramachandran, a vegetable trader from Gandhi Market said.The district administration has deployed police personnel near the market to avoid further protests. The uncertainty over relocating has also irked the consumer organisations due to the poor planning. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/vegetable-traders-still-divided-over-shifting-to-g-corner/articleshow/82021622.cms||---

---||Bareilly||UP: Patient killed by fellow patient following argument over bed occupancy||BAREILLY: A patient admitted to a medical college was killed by another patient over occupancy of bed in Shahjahanpur. The quarrel began when accused Abdul Rehman asked fellow patient Hansram to vacate his bed. As Hansram refused, Abdul started beating him. By the time the hospital staff arrived, Hansram was dead. Police have detained Abdul, whose father said the man was mentally ill and under treatment. According to the hospital authorities, Hansram (45) had complained of high fever and weakness after which he was admitted to the hospital on Friday Accused Abdul (25) was getting treatment for dehydration at a nearby bed of the same ward. On Sunday morning, Abdul came back from the toilet and mistook Hansram bed for his own. He asked him to vacate it. After Hansraj refused, Abdul lifted him from the bed and threw him on the ground. He then sat on his chest and thrashed him, which led to his death. After the incident, Shahjahanpur district magistrate Indra Vikram Singh and senior police officials also visited the hospital and ensured necessary action was taken against the accused.  Abdul’s father Rehman claimed that his son was mentally ill but he couldn’t provide medical documents to support his claim. The family members of the deceased created a ruckus, accusing the hospital administration of negligence. Superintendent of police (city) Sanjay Kumar said, “We have registered an FIR under section 304 (culpable homicide) and the accused has been detained. He is not able to give proper answers to our questions. The family members of the victim are satisfied with police action.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/patient-killed-by-fellow-patient-following-argument-over-bed-occupancy/articleshow/82019998.cms||---
---||Kolkata||With counting days away, heavy security, 24x7 vigil protect EVMs||KOLKATA: The EVMs, which hold key to the political fortunes of several candidates of the Kasba-Tollygunge-Jadavpur-Behala belts, have been locked up in the strongrooms at nine counting centres across six premises in the city and the area around them have been fortified with a two-tier security arrangement (comprising of central forces and Kolkata Police personnel and special checking arranged at four different points) and round-the-clock vigil. The counting is still three weeks away and, thus, the protection of EVMs will be a challenge this time. “Kolkata usually votes in the last phase. This time too, proper south and north Kolkata will vote in the last two phases. However, the added areas have gone to vote early with South 24 Parganas having already completed the elections. Hence the challenge of protecting EVMs — in the middle of a raging political heat — will be greater,” said a senior officer from Behala division. The EVMs for Kasba, Tollygunge, Jadavpur and Behala have been secured at Vivekananda College in Thakurpukur, Hastings House, Behala Bratachari School, Dinabandhu Andrews College, Geetanjali Stadium and the Alipore treasury, said officers at Lalbazar. Six more centres will be added to this list when voting takes place on April 26 and 29 in other parts of Kolkata. Till May 2, when the counting of votes is scheduled, only authorised personnel of the central forces and Election Commission can go anywhere close to strongrooms, housing the sealed voting machines . “The district EVMs are being protected through a three layered security where, besides CAPF and local police, the state’s reserved police provides the extra security ring. Since Kolkata Police do not have such an unit, officers from the battalions will join the local police in securing the area. Guard rails have been kept at approach roads to the counting centres to prevent any vehicle from getting close and pickets have been set up outside the strongrooms with sandbags and armed personnel of central forces to foil any attempt to snatch voting machines. There are strict instructions not to let any unauthorised person inside the counting centres. The drivers and other staff engaged by central forces have been allotted separate space, away from the strongrooms housing EVMs. “The outermost layer is monitored by Kolkata Police to prevent any unauthorised person from getting close to the counting centre. It is followed with a security layer just outside the entry points to the counting centres. Security personnel are guarding the gates while the innermost ring is around the strongrooms where the EVMs are kept. Eight to ten armed personnel are guarding the strongrooms round the clock,” said a senior cop adding that a total of 24 CAPF personnel will be on duty in each 24 hour cycle. Each strongroom, too, has CCTV cameras. No workers of any party would be allowed anywhere close to it. However, political parties — especially the TMC — have arranged for party workers to keep a vigil on the strong rooms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/with-counting-days-away-heavy-security-24x7-vigil-protect-evms/articleshow/82021632.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Amma Mandapam main road branching off near Mambalasalai junction near Cauvery bridge goes all the way till the Rajagopuram of Arulmigu Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam. Dozens of residential streets branch off from the main road on both sides as people frequently cross the main road. As devotees including VIPs reaching the temple use the stretch, they are being accused of speeding near the residential streets. “Even passengers who disembark from city buses have raised apprehension to cross the roads at ease. Minor accidents are repeatedly happening on the stretch but those were not properly recorded for the authorities to investigate,” said SR Kishore Kumar, an advocate. The road near Amma mandapam is four-lane and merges into two-lanes at Malattaru channel bridge. The lethargy of pedestrians crossing the roads cannot be underestimated too. The state highways department that manages the road said that installing speed breakers is not feasible on the main road as it is commuted by VIPs too. “We will investigate the accidents reported on the stretch. If more than two fatal accidents have been reported in a year, speed breakers will be considered. Meanwhile, we will look for other solutions to prevent accidents,” an official source with the state highway said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/plea-for-speed-breakers-on-amma-mandapam-road/articleshow/82021620.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: 240 vaccinated individuals test positive for Covid-19 in Ernakulam||KOCHI: As many as 240 of the vaccinated individuals tested positive for Covid till Friday in Ernakulam, further endorsing the appeal of health authorities to follow Covid protocols even after vaccination. Though a detailed analysis into these cases is yet to be started, it has been noted that most of the infected are Category A patients, where the individual is either asymptomatic or having minor symptoms. The 240 cases include those who tested positive soon after inoculated with first dose, the ones tested positive after many days and those who took both the doses. It also includes healthcare workers, first-line workers and the general public. “The 240 patients are in all categories, A, B and C. But most of them are in Category A. We cannot say that it is the problem of the vaccine. We don’t know whether the vaccinated people were exposed to Covid patients before the inoculation. Though the vaccine is only 70% efficient, it helps to prevent mortality among infected individuals,” said a health official. Meanwhile, the monthly district analysis report, submitted to the district administration, noted that with the increase in positive patients, cases with unknown sources will also increase, adding further burden to the surveillance and containment strategies. The health officials reached this conclusion after noting that nearly half of the cases reported in the last one week were asymptomatic ones. It also found that delay in detecting the infection will lead to disproportionate increase in ICU admissions. Though the cases per million is highest in Thrikkakara, high test positivity rates are in Koothattukulam and Maradu municipalities with 11.88% and 11.73% respectively. While in panchayats, it is in Elamkunnapuzha with 21.08%. The report calls for strengthening of contract tracing. As per the state report, the contacts to case ratio of Ernakulam was two in the last week. It should be increased to at least four per case. The report warns that the average number of new cases will reach 700 in next two weeks if urgent containment measures are not followed. The report had details till April 8. As summer vacation is around the corner, health authorities expect higher inflow of travellers from neighbouring states, which will further increase the surge if surveillance is not done properly. Ernakulam has so far seen 453 Covid deaths till April 8.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/240-vaccinated-individuals-test-ve-in-ekm/articleshow/82020830.cms||T C Sreemol

They urged the government to ensure proper power supply to save summer crops such as paddy, cotton, sugarcane and banana. Farmers said that free power supply was earlier provided 20 hours a day, which was reduced to 14 and then to 12 hours. “In tune with the chief minister’s announcement in the assembly, farmers got 24 hours three-phase power supply from April 1 to 6 – the date of polling. However, from the next day onwards, there was no 24-hour supply. Instead, they received less than 12 hours supply only,” alleged the secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association, Swamimalai S Vimalnathan. Due to low voltage and frequent power cuts, farmers have to spend a minimum of Rs 10,000 to repair their electric motors annually, he added. Residents of Thanjavur and rural areas in Trichy also point out that unpredictable power supply during summer can damage electronic appliances. An official from Tangedco however said, regular power supply was being provided to residents and they had not received any complaints so far. “There is a peak demand for power supply during summer. Due to heavy load, sometimes transformers go defunct. When workers fixing the faults, there is no option but to stop power,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/24-hr-power-stopped-after-polling-day-farmers/articleshow/82021629.cms||D Vincent Arockiaraj
---||Ludhiana||Kotkapura firing: Congress faces questions on social media, MLAs worried||JALANDHAR: Going by social media trends, Congress is facing questions over sacrilege and firing cases after Punjab and Haryana High Court cancelled the special investigation report on Kotkapura firing. While Congress supporters are silent, those of Shiromani Akali Dal are rejoicing. Bargari sacrilege, Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura firing cases were the main issues in the 2017 assembly elections, besides issues like drugs and illegal sand mining. These played a major role in Congress victory after a gap of 10 years and SAD being relegated to third place. Notwithstanding the announcement by Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to challenge the HC order in the Apex court, sources in the Congress said there is considerable concern in party circles and MLAs are worried about the likely reaction they would face at ground level. “In the beginning of our tenure, we could claim that investigation was on and people should wait but now, with less than one year to elections, we are set to face questions. Among MLAs or even in cadres, there are apprehensions about the issue,” said a Congress MLA. Another Congress MLA said, “We have landed in an embarrassing situation on this issue, that too when we are already facing questions about performance on other issues.” The apprehensions of Congress MLAs and other leaders don’t appear to be misplaced, suggest reactions on social media. Sikh netizens have expressed disappointment as well as anger at the latest development. Most are blaming the Congress and several are questioning the sincerity of the state government. Captain Amarinder Singh’s announcement about challenging the HC order on his official FB page received criticism from netizens, who questioned the intentions of his government. “The question remains, who ordered police firing on Sikhs in Kotkapura sitting peacefully to protest beadbi of Guru Granth Sahib in 2015, Bargari. High Court decision to constitute a new SIT, keeping Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh out, is likely to drag the investigation indefinitely. Efforts of a non-Sikh Bihari IPS officer to uncover the truth stand wasted, but I appreciate them,” posted former SGPC general secretary Kiranjot Kaur on her FB wall. Her post was widely shared. Punjab and Haryana High Court advocate H C Arora, known for his important PILs, termed the developments as a “cause of worry” on his FB post.

The fight which started with a verbal duel soon went out of hand when Gupta’s younger brother Sanjay allegedly took out a pistol, grabbed the MLA's collar and thrashed him badly - all in front of cops. The entire brawl has been caught on camera and purported video clips of BJP 'netas' fighting over candidates have now gone viral. The incident took place in Nakha area of Lakhimpur Kheri on Sunday. When contacted, BJP district president Sunil Singh said, “The incident occurred in the heat of the moment. It was mainly due to a misunderstanding. I met both the sides and their issue is now resolved." "I have formed a panel to probe the matter and provide a report within 48 hours. The same report will be forwarded to the party's high command in Lucknow,” Singh added. The BJP MLA told TOI, "I will wait for the party high command's decision before filing an FIR. Few contestants wanted to withdraw their nomination papers on their own will, but [Pawan] Gupta was forcing them to contest in the polls. He behaved like a goon, but I was calm." Gupta was unavailable for comment. Sources said the party had reportedly decided to field a candidate backed by the MLA for the Nakha block while Gupta wanted his close aide to contest from the same seat. Both the contestants had filed their nominations and were threatening each other’s voters. On Sunday, the BJP MLA from Lakhimpur Sadar constituency visited the locality and tried to convince Gupta’s candidate to withdraw his nomination which led to the ugly scenes in full public view. Kheri SSP Vijay Dhull said, "I have sought a report of this incident from the circle officer concerned. None of the sides have lodged any complaint so far." In March 2019, Verma was in the news after being shot at by a mining mafia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/bjp-mla-kheri-block-chief-thrash-each-other-brandish-gun-over-up-panchayat-poll-candidate/articleshow/82020067.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Run entirely by acid attack survivors, the café was facing heavy losses due to the ongoing pandemic and almost negligible footfall of foreign tourists. The NGO, which was running the unique restaurant, cited financial crisis behind suspending operations. The café attracted global attention since it was started in December 2014. For 15-odd survivors, whose stories made it to the big screen in Deepika Padukone-fame ‘Chappak’, life came to an abrupt halt. To keep operations running, they tried online delivery, but orders were very few. “It wasn’t viable, we were left with no other option than suspending operation,” said Ritu, a survivor. A note shared by the café management said, “With extreme pain and grief, we would like to inform you that our most acknowledged venture, Sheroes Hangout Café, Agra is going to be shut down with immediate effect. Ever since the pandemic began, our café at Agra and Lucknow went into a serious financial crisis with a dip of about 80% in total revenues”. The NGO’s parting note said that all those who were dependent on the café now face a bleak future. “Even after the curtailment of restrictions and our constant efforts to revive the café, it incurred heavy losses due to the negligible number of customers visiting the café. The situation has worsened to the extent that we received no financial benefits since the pandemic began. 15 acid attack survivors are dependent on the café to look after themselves and their families. Apart from this, there are several staff members who are financially dependent on the café. With the shutting of the café, their survival is at risk,” said a senior member of Chhanv Foundation, the non-profit that backs the Sheroes initiative. Founder of Sheroes café and director of Chhanv foundation Ashish Shukla said, “We were not able to bear the cost of running the café. Besides a steep decline in sales, donations also reduced by 75% over the last one year. Agra café was hugely dependent on foreign tourists. Following travel restrictions, we were hardly left with any source of income. Sheroes café, Lucknow is trying to survive its online delivery service. We don’t know who long it will be able to operate.” Ashish added, “We will be taking care of the medical requirements of the survivors. Their skill training program will also continue. We need help to revive the café and bring back the lost smiles on the faces of our survivors. We look forward to restarting the café in future.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/no-sales-donations-drying-up-sheroes-caf-run-by-acid-attack-survivors-shuts-down-in-agra/articleshow/82020075.cms||Deepak Lavania

While the city has observed rigorous immunization programme in past 48-hours, Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) said that the vaccination was stopped for planning and logistic purposes. “The mega vaccination drive started by the local civic body is receiving huge response across 115 municipal wards. However, vaccination programme was halted for a day on Sunday as we have to carry out planning for execution of the drive during the next week,” AMC health officer Dr. Neeta Padalkar said. On speculations that AMC might be facing shortage of vaccine doses, Padalkar said that the local civic body still has around 10,000 doses in stock and fresh stock was expected shortly. As per official data, as many as 7,385 beneficiaries took the dose of Covid-19 within municipal limits in Aurangabad on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/vaccination-stops-in-aurangabad/articleshow/82020090.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Sukhbir Badal jumping gun on HC order, says Punjab CM Amarinder Singh||CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Sunday mocked Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Badal for jumping the gun on the Punjab and Haryana high court orders in the 2015 Kotkapura firing case, saying that the judiciary was yet to release the judgment. Amarinder also advised Sukhbir to refrain from making merry, reminding him that the case was far from being over. “At least wait for the copy of the orders before claiming victory,” he advised Sukhbir, who had reacted to media reports of the high court’s decision on the investigation carried out by the state police SIT. The CM pointed out that the high court had not announced the order officially. “In any case, whatever the verdict in the matter, I stand by the investigation of the SIT, which has, at no point, absolved the Badal family of involvement in the heinous incident that led to innocent people losing their lives,” said the CM. He also promised justice for victims’ families and punishment for guilty, irrespective of who they are. Amarinder again made it clear that the Punjab government will challenge any court order that either quashed the SIT probe or removed the officer in-charge, IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh. He also said Sukhbir’s desperation to celebrate exposed his panic in the face of what he must have seen as writing on the wall, given the direction in which the SIT investigation was pointing. The SIT has till now chargesheeted six persons in the Kotkapura police firing case, including against then Kotkapura SAD MLA Mantar Singh Brar. The chargesheet against Brar mentioned: “On the analysis of the call details, it has been established that he made phone calls to the then chief minister of Punjab Parkash Singh Badal through the special principal secretary to the CM (Gagandeep Singh Brar) and OSD to the CM, Gurcharan Singh.” Amarinder pointed out that the Badal family had left no stone unturned in four years to scuttle the probe in the case, which they had been responsible for handing over to the CBI in the first place. “As part of a ruling coalition at the Centre, SAD had pulled all stops to prevent the probe from reaching its logical conclusion, forcing the present government in the state to fight to get the case back from the central agency and hand it over to SIT to complete the investigation,” he added. CM takes dig at AAP’s MannTaking a dig at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for trying to make political hay over the issue, Amarinder said like Sukhbir, AAP MP Bhagwant Mann had also been shooting through his mouth without knowing the high court’s mind. He termed it as the theatrics of Arvind Kejriwal’s party which, he said, had no presence at all in the state. Mann’s charge of collusion between Congress and SAD on the issue is not only ludicrous but logic-defying, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cm-mocks-sukhbir-for-jumping-gun-on-hc-orders-in-kotkapura-police-firing/articleshow/82021647.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Man-animal conflict sees spurt amid raging forest fires in Uttarakhand||DEHRADUN: The raging wildfires in the hill state have brought to the fore another problem of sorts for the authorities -- a spurt in man-animal conflict. In the most recent case on Saturday, a three-year-old girl playing outside her home was mauled to death by a leopard in Pauri district where over 700 hectares of forests were gutted in fires. This was barely 24 hours after an elderly woman was trampled to death by an elephant. The districts which have witnessed a rampant rise in such cases in the wake of the fires are Nainital, Almora, Tehri, Haridwar, Chamoli and Dehradun. While cages have been installed to trap leopards in Almora and Haridwar, the demand for the same is increasing in the areas around Dehradun too. According to data available with the forest department, at least 17 animals have been killed in the recent fires and 22 sustained injuries. This is apart from the scores of animals which have either fled or were charred to death. State forest minister Harak Singh Rawat, who was in Pauri on Sunday to meet the family of the three-year-old killed in leopard attack, said that the rising cases of human-animal conflict in the wake of the fires is a major challenge. “With forest fires, wild animals, too, are venturing out of forests in search of safety. Recently, we rescued a barking deer from a petrol pump. It was being chased by a pack of stray dogs,” said Satish Shah, a forest guard in Pauri. Echoing similar sentiments, Manora range officer BS Mehta said, “Some youths saved a hog deer trapped in Nainital's Ranibagh recently. It was immediately shifted to a treatment facility.” Head of forest force Rajiv Bhartari, too, reached Manora and Bhowali forest ranges of Nainital on Sunday to take stock of the situation and assess preparedness to tackle the fires. He said, “In such testing times, we should all join hands to do our best to save the flora and fauna. It can be anything from driving slow on key stretches to alerting the forest officials about fires or animals in distress.” Speaking about the issue, Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) scientist Pratyush P said, “Brown fauna which lays eggs in bushes and dry branches on the ground are the worst-affected. It is time the forest dwellers of each state are given key roles in fighting such crises. Locals should also be trained to save such animals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/man-animal-conflict-sees-spurt-amid-raging-fires/articleshow/82020095.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Kolkata||False Cov negatives force repeat RT-PCR tests||Kolkata: Scores of patients have tested false negative for Covid across diagnostic centres and hospitals over the last fortnight but repeat RT-PCR tests, conducted within 2-3 days, confirmed the presence of the virus. Some have even required multiple tests to detect the virus which has remained elusive even though symptoms pointed at Covid, say doctors. Various factors, including a low viral load, could be responsible for this, they say. At Belle Vue Clinic, more than a dozen patients have needed multiple RT-PCR tests to detect the virus. “In some cases, the patients’ chest CT scan had prominent indications of the virus but test report didn’t confirm the disease. These included some critical ITU patients who had to be treated for Covid without confirmation. Later, a couple of them did test positive,” said Belle Vue internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain. Several patients at Peerless Hospital, too, have tested positive on repeat tests. Other than a low viral load, they might have been tested too early, according to Peerless Hospital microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Choudhury. “If a sample is collected within 48 hours of the viral intrusion, an RT-PCR may fail to detect it. Often, the collection is wrongly done or the cold chain is not properly maintained. Many are delaying the test and the virus is already gone when they are eventually taking it,” said Choudhury. Those delaying a test despite symptoms could be at risk, pointed out Jain. “I have come across a few patients who turned critical — with all the Covid symptoms — but their test report was negative. They had breathing distress and their lung condition suggested Covid. So, clinicoradiological diagnosis should be followed at all times. We are treating such patients for Covid for it could be fatal otherwise,” said Jain. Inadequate sampling, improper transport and late swabs may miss Covid in RT-PCR tests, said experts. “Heuristics have a big role to play in a pandemic. Any long slender object which slithers in the dark is almost always a snake. A long object which does not move on being struck with a stick is either a dead snake or a rope. Similarly, we must exclude Covid vigorously in all fevers in the present scenario, especially if there is cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea, loss of smell or taste, or other tell-tale cardinal symptoms of Covid,” said Jain. Some test kits now come with a disclaimer that it may not be able to detect the virus in all cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/false-cov-negatives-force-repeat-rt-pcr-tests/articleshow/82020877.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

These start-ups are offering tourists a range of options from customising their trips to showing offbeat places at major tourist spots. Bhaskar Pant, founder of LastClues – a platform that provides a “to-do” list option to its customers at various tourist spots across the country – told TOI, “During the lockdown last year, I realised that once this is over, people would want to go out and travel and that’s why I started LastClues. The idea was soon turned into reality and now, we have close to 20 people working for the platform and over 350 registered service providers across the country are using it to reach out to tourists,” Pant said. He added, “A PDF ticket is generated on the website for which an advance amount is required to be paid. The tourists can visit the location and show the ticket to the service provider. They can pay the rest of the amount once they are satisfied with the service.” Similarly, another website named Truehab is using artificial intelligence to connect travellers with experts and agents to help them find new and offbeat destinations. “We do not just want to provide hotel bookings and travel service. We aim to provide the travellers with a cultural experience of the place. Therefore, we are building a platform for vacationers where people can plan their cost-optimal trips and explore new destinations,” said Prem Kukreja, one of the founders of the start-up. Meanwhile, an upcoming start-up named Terrabot is planning to offer 'Caravan Tourism'. Founded by Delhi-resident Vaneesh Mittal, Terrabot claims to be planning the country’s first 'Caravan Tourism' network. “Caravan tourism has existed worldwide for several years. However, this is a very new concept in India. We have the caravans or motor homes which we call Terrabots and these are stationed at a depot. Travellers can choose and plan their trips in any particular region. We also have a network of caravan parks where travellers can park their Terrabots and spend a few nights with nature,” Mittal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/start-ups-ideated-during-lockdown-helping-tourism-industry-amid-speculations-of-another-round-of-curbs/articleshow/82020109.cms||Prashant Jha

Bamu vice -chancellor Pramod Yeole said conducting online viva voce was part of organized efforts on the part of the university to have minimal or no impact of the pandemic situation on academic activities. “Like every other sphere of life, education sector is also witnessing the new normal owing to the Covid-19 outbreak and we have to brace up for related challenges. The online conduct of oral examinations for Ph.D admissions also ensured saving time and energy of the candidates and university faculties,” he said. Yeole added that no compromise with talent of candidates and quality of research work was accepted. As per official data, engineering stream witnessed the maximum 33 online viva voce for Ph.D course at Bamu followed by English (32), Chemistry (24), Educational Science (23), Management Science (20), among others.

Bamu public relations officer Sanjay Shinde said the examinations were conducted in a smooth manner. “While examinations for traditional courses like Arts, Commerce and Science are on since March 16, those for professional courses have been started since April 6. As majority of students have preferred offline mode of examinations over online mode, all Covid prevention norms are followed to ensure safety of students,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/339-appear-for-ph-d-viva-voce-in-virtual-mode-bamu/articleshow/82020105.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand records 7 deaths in forest fires this season; in recent incident, 19-year-old youth who was trying to douse blaze in Pithoragarh charred||PITHORAGARH/DEHRADUN: A 19-year-old youth was charred to death while trying to save the forests of Bhadgaon village in Didihat in Pithoragarh on Saturday making it yet another casualty of forest fires in Uttarakhand this season, the seventh such death as per the forest department. Sources said that the youth, Pankaj Deopa, had lost his job in the Covid-19-imposed lockdown last year and was staying at his home in the village. He was trying to save the trees surrounding his village when he suddenly slipped into a 300-mtr-deep fire-filled gorge and suffered multiple injuries. He was taken to hospital where doctors declared him dead. Multiple deaths have been reported in this season ever since the state’s forests started blazing in October last year. The first two deaths were recorded from Almora where a woman and her daughter-in-law died in separate incidents while trying to protect the fodder of their livestock and wood from the fires on January 24 and 28 respectively. This was followed by two deaths from a village in Bageshwar on February 3. Dharam Singh (60) and Devki Devi (56) of Daubat village in Bageshwar died while trying to douse wildfires. Then, on February 12, two forest department employees — Harimohan and Dinesh Lal — succumbed while trying to douse wildfires in Pauri district as they slipped into a gorge and suffered head injuries. The deaths of the forest personnel not only exposed how ill-equipped the forest department was in its fire-fighting capabilities but also got the state government to wake up to the enormity of the forest fire situation. Soon after the incident, then-CM Trivendra Rawat had called an urgent meeting of all stakeholders and directed adequate preparations to tackle wildfires. He had also announced that any employee of forest department dying in the line of duty will get Rs 15 lakh as compensation. Besides the seven fatalities, there have been two more deaths in fire-related incidents although forest officials say they are waiting for the respective district magistrates to confirm whether the fatalities were due to forest fires. Man Singh, nodal officer (forest fires) of the state forest department said, “Two deaths had occured in Chamoli and Pithoragarh respectively but they had happened in private agricultural farms and not in forests, therefore, respective district magistrates would take a call regarding their categorisation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-records-7-deaths-in-forest-fires-this-season-in-recent-incident-19-year-old-youth-who-was-trying-to-douse-blaze-in-pithoragarh-charred/articleshow/82020100.cms||Shivani Azad

Sukhbir advised the chief minister to relax and not get “overly jittery” in the face of the impending poll disaster in February next year. Reacting to Amarinder’s statement suggesting that the SAD president was “merry making prematurely” over the high court verdict even before a copy of the judgment had been officially released, Sukhbir said, “This is truly hilarious nonsense. Only a person like Amarinder living in a pleasure dome and famous for leisure and luxury culture could even think of merrymaking while talking about an issue of the most profound gravity such as the painful sacrilege-related incidents.” “If the chief minister is himself not aware of the high court order, what is he or his government going to challenge in the supreme court?” said Sukhbir. The SAD president said that he and his party had faith in the judiciary and that the media reports on the high court verdict on Friday had fully vindicated that faith.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sukhbir-says-punjab-cm-ranting-over-hc-order/articleshow/82021650.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Why one year for a report in ‘trivial’ matter: Bombay HC to top cop||MUMBAI: Bombay high court (HC) has directed the Mumbai top cop to initiate an appropriate inquiry against an investigating officer who took over a year to file a report in a “trivial” matter. HC passed the order while quashing a 2014 case against then engineering student for rashly riding a bike. “Such inquiry report to be submitted to this court within three months,” a bench of justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale said on Friday on a petition filed by Mohaseen Khan, now a 27-year-old engineer. He petitioned HC this year to quash criminal proceedings and an order passed by a magistrate on grounds that the prosecution was barred by limitation. Under criminal law, a magistrate can take cognizance of an offence within a year of its commission, if sentence it attracts is up to a year imprisonment, his lawyer argued. Maximum punishment for rash driving is 6 months. The magistrate took cognisance, a pre-trial step, in 2017. Khan’s lawyer said he lost a chance to work in Oman due to the case, but the offer is still open and so he moved the HC. The prosecutor argued that a magistrate has powers to extend time to take cognisance in public interest. HC said there was “nothing to show that the court of magistrate had either applied its mind to the aspect of expiry of limitation or… condoning the delay” It said the magistrate’s could not have taken cognizance in 2017 and held “further continuance of criminal proceedings cannot be sustained.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/why-one-year-for-a-report-in-trivial-matter-bombay-hc-to-top-cop/articleshow/82022392.cms||Swati Deshpande

The spotting hints at the rich biodiversity in the fringe areas of the city, which need to be protected,” he said. Shy among the different dove varieties, the Oriental turtle dove is known for its attractive plumage and a call in four clear notes producing a “hr-hr oo-oo” sound. Bird researcher Pankaj Shakkarwar said that in the past, Oriental turtle doves were spotted at the Gautala-Autramghat wildlife sanctuary and Sarola area, located around 30km from Aurangabad. “The Sawangi dam is situated in the mountain range that passes through different parts of Aurangabad and is known to be the home for a wide range of flora and fauna,” he said. Located near Harsul, the Sawangi dam was filled to the brim following the monsoon last year after more than a decade. It still holds sufficient volume of water. Besides Oriental turtle dove, the dam has also attracted northern shovelers, garganey, red crested pochard, common pochard, brahminy kite and different wagtails among other birds this migratory season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/oriental-turtle-dove-spotted-at-sawangi-dam-on-outskirts-of-aurangabad/articleshow/82020132.cms||---

During the peak of the pandemic, the single-day high was recorded on August 26 last year, when 3,018 cases were reported. While it took six months for the first wave to reach its peak, it barely took over a month for the second wave to break the single-day spike record. The active novel coronavirus caseload now stands at 20,187, having doubled in the last five days. On Sunday, seven Covid-19 deaths were recorded, taking the total count of coronavirus deaths to 1,759 across the state.

Of the 3,187 cases recorded on Sunday, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), Medchal Malkajgiri, Ranga Reddy and Sanga Reddy together accounted for 1,259 cases. “Currently, majority of the cases are being seen in and around Hyderabad (GHMC limits). Also, cases are increasing in Adilabad, Nizamabad, Nirmal, and few other districts. Due to high infectivity, cases are increasing rapidly. The numbers are likely to increase further,” said Dr Rao. The number of people being tested for Covid-19 has also increased to a record level in the state with health authorities ramping up testing from just 50,000 about 10 days back to 1.15 lakh tests conducted on Saturday and Sunday.

His elder brother, 35-year-old Pappu, who had allegedly helped him in burying the body in a field near their home, was arrested on Sunday. The alleged murder took place on Wednesday when the youth and his younger sister, 16, fought over some issue. The youth, in a fit anger, allegedly hit his sister with a stick on her head. “They fought over some issue. My brother hit her with a stick and she died. Later I helped him in burying the body in the field. There was no one else involved in the family,” Pappu is said to have told police in Khurja. The alleged crime came to the fore when the villagers didn’t see the girl for quite a few days and became suspicious. Police were alerted. During questioning, Pappu confessed to the crime and the girl’s body was exhumed. And it was sent for post-mortem examination. “It looks like the accused accidently hit his sister on the head during the fight. The minor accused is still absconding,” Santosh Kumar, Bulandshahr’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) said. Based on the complaint of the village guard, an FIR under relevant sections was registered at Khurja Dehat police station. Police teams are carrying out raids in search of the main accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/youth-17-on-the-run-after-killing-sister-elder-brother-who-helped-him-bury-her-nabbed/articleshow/82020134.cms||Piyush Rai

Addressing the mediapersons after the high court had ordered formation of a new special investigating team (SIT) in the Kotkapura police firing case by rejecting the probe reports of the SIT, headed by IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, Mann said it seemed less of the decision of the court and more of the mutual association between Amarinder and family members of former chief minister and SAD patron Parkash Singh Badal. The AAP MP from Sagrur claimed the Badals had withdrawn all of Amarinder’s cases at the last moment of their SAD-BJP government. “Now, Amarinder is withdrawing cases against Badals in the last year of his government. The only difference between the two is that the witness in Amarinder’s case turned hostile and in Badal’s case, the lawyer turned hostile,” he alleged. Mann accused the Punjab government of having a “weak lawyer” and said not having a big lawyer in such a big case was a planned conspiracy. He said that in the matter of appointment of retired IAS officer Suresh Kumar as chief principal secretary, Capt Amarinder had immediately called senior advocate and Congress functionary P Chidambaram by air. Similarly, in the case of UP gangster-turned-MLA Mukhtar Ansari, the Amarinder government brought many senior and expensive lawyers to the court, he added. The AAP leader alleged that when the Aarinder government has to win a case, it hired a big lawyer, but when a case had to be lost, he handed over the case to advocate general Atul Nanda. He also accused Nanda of not winning a single big case for Punjab till date. Mann said SIT chief Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh was a “good and honest police officer and he had investigated the case very honestly and prepared the report”, but Sukhbir Badal’s name was coming up in the SIT report, so the Amarinder government’s advocate general did not present the matter well before the court. “This all is because Amarinder wants to save the Badals,” said Mann. He also accused Capt Amarinder of trying to save the conspirators of the sacrilege case and the Kotkapura case. “The whole Punjab knows who was behind the sacrilege case. Then, why does the Captain government want to save the Badals,” Mann asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mann-accuses-capt-govt-of-saving-badals-in-kotkapura-police-firing-case/articleshow/82021653.cms||---

There is lack of doctors and nurses in the hospital to treat the patients, they alleged in a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Bele charged that guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar had made tall claims of creating ample Covid treatment facilities in the district during the peak of the first wave. However, he has failed to fulfill his promises, they alleged. They also alleged that posts of 61 doctors and 135 nurses are vacant in government hospitals. Similarly two oxygen plants having 20 kilo capacity have not started despite assurance. Guardian minister had announced a 300 oxygen bed facility at women hospital, but administration had failed to make it operational so far. The facility of 180 oxygen bed and 80 beds available at GMCH is insufficient and there is a need for an 100 additional bed facility there. They pointed out that there is a need for a full time physician doctor in Covid ward at GMCH. Bele alleged that presently physicians pay visit during morning and evening hours and contract workers deployed at the Covid ward are burdened with the responsibility of treating patients in their absence. He has also complained about lack of Remdesivir and other medicines along with oxygen at GMCH and other government covid hospitals. He has also alleged that there are only four to five Covid testing centres in city which is quite insufficient compared to the high population here.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cong-corporators-covid-hosp-not-functioning/articleshow/82022396.cms||Mazhar Ali

Many places in Aurangabad also witnessed a few short spells of drizzle. The meteorological department has predicted such weather conditions to continue till April 14. Mandodari Ganpat Adhe, a 40-year-old resident of Mauje Kehal Wadgaon in Matha taluka of Jalna district, died after being struck by lightning in a turmeric farm on Saturday evening. “Three more people working in the same farm were injured and were admitted to a local hospital. They are recuperating,” said Jalna district disaster management officer Deepak Kajalkar. Hingoli district, which also received unseasonal rainfall accompanied by thunderstorms, reported the death of 45-year-old Laxman Narayan Tambile in a turmeric farm at the Waghjali village at Sengao taluka. Besides Aurangabad, Jalna and Hingoli, parts of Latur district among other areas in Marathwada also reported adverse weather events in the 24-hour period. In a weather forecast, the Parbhani-based Vasantrao NaikMarathwada Agricultural University has said that gusty winds were likely in many parts of the region in the next 72-hours. “Incidents of lightning, thunderstorms and unseasonal rain are likely in different parts of the region till April 14. Farmers are advised not to stand below trees or take shelter in metal-sheds during these weather events as that increases the chances of getting struck by lightning,” said K K Dakhore, an agricultural meteorologist at the university. As per the India Meteorological Department (IMD), around 45% relative humidity level was observed in Aurangabad. At 39.1 degrees celsius, the maximum temperature in Aurangabad was above normal by one unit.

---||Meerut||UP: Sweets make cops sweat it out before panchayat polls||Meerut: As rural polls drew closer, contestants are outdoing one another in giving villagers boxes of sweets in their bid to woo them. Police, on their part, are confiscating some of them before they reach the address. Hundreds of quintals of sweets have been seized in several parts of the state by police, which is also booking the distributors for poll code violation. And, argubally for the first time, such a large quantity of sweets are sharing space with illicit liquor, illegal arms and other banned stuff in the 'malkhanas' of police. Police on Sunday seized at least three quintals of ladoos in Hapur district ahead of the panchayat elections which start April 15. The recovery was made from Simbhavali area in the district. An FIR under relevant sections of spreading disease of the IPC and representation of people’s act has been registered against two persons, Munsaid and Akram. Both have been arrested. Police said the ladoos will be returned to the owner after valuation. “The owner will pay for the valuation of the seized goods and it will be kept with the police in the ‘malkhana’. Based on the court’s verdict, it will be returned to the owner or deposited with the government treasury,” Sarvesh Mishra, Hapur’s additional superintendent of police said. Agra Police last week seized 70 boxes of soanpapri and 387 boxes of boondi ladoos which were prepared for distribution among voters. A few days before that, a candidate was arrested with 100 packets of rasgullas in Amroha. While in Baghpat district, relatives of a contestant were found using a heavy earthmoving machine and spades for mixing ingredients to prepare ladoos to be distributed to voters. The accused have been being booked. On Saturday, police had seized two quintals of jalebis from a village in Unnao. Polling for all gram panchayats, kshetra panchayats and zila panchayats will be held in four phases from April 15, 19, 26 and 29. Counting of votes will be done on May 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/sweets-make-cops-sweat-it-out-before-rural-polls-hundreds-of-quintals-seized/articleshow/82020141.cms||Piyush Rai
---||India||Now, AI-based device to alert drivers when they doze off||NEW DELHI: The need to ensure drivers of defence vehicles don’t doze off while on a long drive and meet with a road crash has resulted in inventing an artificial intelligence-based device that can alert the driver with a loud buzzer, if his eyes are closed for more than three seconds. The device can prove to be a boon to prevent a large share of road crashes. This device, which was developed by one Colonel Kuldeep Yadav of Military College of Electronics and Mechanical Engineering (MCEME) at Secunderabad, has been tested in three army vehicles for three months. Lt General TSA Narayanan, Commandant at MCEME said the trial run has been very successful and this month they handed over one device to the Telangana government for trial on commercial vehicles. “We have got the IPR for this. We worked on this device to minimise the risk of accidents of our vehicles. The production of this device can be scaled up quickly. The current estimated price would be around Rs 10,000 for a device, but the cost will reduce once there is large scale production,” Narayanan told TOI. The AI-based Accident Prevention System is a small, economical and rugged device that can be mounted in the driver’s compartment. The system is designed to be adjustable and can be easily mounted on existing cars and trucks. With some design change the size can also be reduced. The power supply to the device is taken directly from the vehicle battery and can be used for long hours. It is also equipped to alert the vehicle owners through email. In a study carried out for the road transport ministry in 2019, one-fourth of drivers had admitted that they had fallen asleep behind the wheel while driving and this was more prevalent in the case of truck drivers. Another study by the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) on crashes on the 300-km Agra-Lucknow Expressway had also found that exhausted drivers who dozed off at the wheel were responsible for about 40% of such incidents. Now across the globe there has been more focus on using the AI and technology solutions to prevent crashes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/now-ai-based-device-to-alert-drivers-when-they-doze-off/articleshow/82023123.cms||Dipak K Dash

In the first phase, more than 54,000 students have already been allotted seats and more rounds of admissions will be held. This year, the government authorities completed the mapping of over 34,000 schools which hold more than four lakh seats. Efforts are on to enroll more students under the drive. “As many as 54,727 students have already been allotted the seats under the RTE initiative in the first phase. This year, the government authorities completed the mapping of 34,483 schools which have 4,07,978 seats for RTE students,” read the government order. According to the statistics, maximum applications came from 10 districts of UP -- Lucknow, Varanasi, Kanpur, Aligarh, Moradabad, Gorakhpur, Ghaziabad, Agra, Gautam Budh Nagar and Saharanpur. The second phase of applications will be accepted between April 24 and April 26. Selection will be done on the basis of a lottery on April 28. The RTE aims to provide free and compulsory education to all children in the age group of six to14 years. Under the rules, private schools have to reserve 25% of their seats for children belonging to economically and socially backward families. The education department pays Rs 450 per student per month for their education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-govt-gets-ready-for-over-4l-rte-admission/articleshow/82020136.cms||Ishita Bhatia
---||Agra||UP: District prepare to face Covid-19 surge||MEERUT, AGRA: With a surge in Covid-19 cases across Uttar Pradesh, district administrations are preparing to face the second wave of the pandemic at ground zero. A red alert has been sounded with the nine-day Navratri festival and Ramzan due to begin next week. Besides, the state is also gearing up for the four-phase panchayat polls, campaigning for which has begun. In Meerut, district magistrate K Balaji has ordered the chief medical officer to increase the number of beds at all the medical facilities. At present, over 1,000 beds are available for Covid patients in government and private health facilities in Meerut district. “While there is no shortage of beds in Meerut currently, the number of beds at the medical facilities need to be increased so that the health department is on alert and not taken by surprise whenever the cases increase,” Balaji said. The decision comes at a time when the district registered 210 cases on Saturday, the maximum number this year. In Agra, 119 people tested Covid-19 positive on Sunday, the maximum in the last six months. One person died due to comorbidity complications. The district is already facing a shortage of hospital beds and has run out of Remdesivir injections used to treat Covid patients. District magistrate Prabhu N Singh said, “Following government orders, a decision has been taken to restrict public movement from 9 pm to 6 am for eight days from Monday. Essential services and emergency movement will not be affected.” Health staffers will be allowed to travel during the restricted hours on the basis of their identity card. So will those involved in sanitation work, water supply, food supply and private security. Passengers having rail or bus ticket will not be stopped. Nor will movement of goods carriers be restricted. Movement on highways and large-scale construction work will continue as usual. Mathura administration has also imposed night curfew from 9 pm to 6 am from April 11 in order to curb the transmission of the deadly virus. According to the health department, 171 persons have tested positive for the disease since Saturday evening. In Bijnor, district magistrate Ramakant Pandey ordered closure of all weekly markets till further orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/dists-prepare-to-face-covid-19-surge/articleshow/82025127.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur gave more jabs than Mum, Pune last week||Nagpur: The Nagpur district once again maintained its 4th spot among the state’s 35 districts in the Covid vaccination drive in the week gone by. On Sunday, the state crossed one crore inoculations and the 11 districts of Vidarbha have contributed 20% or 20.97 lakh jabs in the overall achievement. In terms of weekly achievement, Nagpur district was ahead of Mumbai which saw an increase of 18.40%. Pune registered 29% increase in vaccination, followed by Thane at 26%. The three bigger districts — Mumbai, Pune and Thane (in this order) — are ahead of Nagpur in cumulative inoculations till date. In the previous week, the Nagpur district vaccination figure stood at 4,67,513 and posted a healthy 33% increase within the next seven days. Mumbai had achieved 13,32,334, Pune (9,74,720) and Thane (5,35,117) as on April 3 morning. In Vidarbha, Nagpur district is at the top position with 33% share in the region’s cumulative vaccination figures. The district has crossed 7 lakh inoculations though the vaccine shortage has equally affected each district with all of them left with just a day’s stock or nothing at all. On Sunday, 6,666 beneficiaries took the jab at the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) centres while 64 turned up at a couple of centres in rural. This indicates the district may not be able to continue the drive entire day on Monday unless it gets new doses. Interestingly, on Saturday the district recorded just 5,000 less inoculation than Mumbai which has a population several times higher than Nagpur. As per the state data, the Nagpur district (20,427) was the only district after Pune (73,114), and Mumbai (25,681) which crossed the 20,000 mark. Perhaps, due to different reporting time, the data from DDHS Nagpur circle showed 20,634 inoculations in the district. Major achievement in the drive came through inoculation of 45+ citizens in the region. Though they were the first in the queue to get inoculated, healthcare workers (HCWs) and frontline workers (FLWs) haven’t really taken much benefit of the opportunity. Till date, 58,372 HCWs and FLWs have taken the first dose while the second dose has been taken by 25,275. The figures indicate HCWs and FLWs continue to remain reluctant even after more than three months when they turned eligible for the jab. As compared to HCWs and FLWs, the number of 45+ beneficiaries has crossed the 5-lakh mark in just over a month and half.

Talking to mediapersons, Yadav said that the party will soon announce the names of its candidates for all the seats in Uttarakhand. When asked if the party would enter into any pre-poll alliance, he said, “SP will not go into any pre-poll alliance with any major party in the upcoming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. I realise that the party organisation is weak here in Uttarakhand but I have asked the workers to resuscitate the party and prepare a roadmap for success on all assembly seats in the state.” The SP leader also slammed UP CM Yogi Adityanath saying that he is on a political tour at a time when the state is reeling under the Covid-19 crisis. “Fresh cases of the virus are increasing every day and there is an acute shortage of medicines in the hospitals. Consequently, several people are losing lives to Covid-19 in Uttar Pradesh.” During his Haridwar visit, Yadav held meetings with Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad president Mahant Narendra Giri, whose Covid-19 report returned positive later in the day, and Shankaracharya Swami Sawaroopanand Saraswati at their camp in the Kumbh Mela area. Besides, he also interacted with the SP workers at the local party office in Jwalapur.

---||Hyderabad||Can’t control 2nd wave unless Covid rules followed: Telangana govt||HYDERABAD: Admitting that controlling the second wave of Covid-19 cases is becoming an uphill task, the Telangana health authorities on Sunday said many people will get affected if adequate precautions are not taken to beat the virus. Top health department officials said infection rates could be very high this year as nearly 90%of cases are asymptomatic, making it impossible to contact, trace and contain active cases in clusters. “The number of cases will increase substantially. This time the morbidity will be high which means that new infections will be high in numbers but the severity and hospitalisations are likely to be a bit lesser compared to the first wave,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director public health, Telangana. Rao said the spread was now becoming very difficult to control and has reiterated the need to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. The state government has strict rule in place for the implementation of mandatory mask rule with a fine of Rs 1,000 and has ramped up testing and vaccination in a bid to cut down on new cases. Sheer negligence and reluctance of people to follow Covid precautions are reasons for the spike, say experts. “Whoever is eligible to take the vaccine must take it and that is one way to break the chain of the spread now,” added Dr Rao. Dr Kiran Madhala, head of department, critical care medicine, Government Medical College, Nizamabad, said because of the high infection rate, everyone living in closed spaces/less space is getting affected. “More households are getting affected in the present wave. People should follow all precautions which were followed during the first wave. Wearing a mask is important when we are unable to follow social distancing. Masks, social distancing and hand wash will protect us from any variant or wave,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cant-control-2nd-wave-unless-covid-rules-followed-t-govt/articleshow/82022446.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Ct value should not influence treatment, say doctors||PUNE: A laboratory marker to identify viral loads in Covid swab samples has led to a division in opinions over its utility and use. Ct (cycle threshold) value indicates the number of cycles completed to identify the virus in a sample during an RT-PCR test. This value is inversely proportional to the viral load in the sample — lower the value, higher the viral presence. Last week, the state wrote to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) asking if the Ct value cut-off can be at 24 (which meant a sample testing over 24 can be described as negative). The ICMR responded by saying it cannot be lower than 35. Dr Balram Bhargava, director general of ICMR, in a letter to state health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas, said a Ct value of less than 35 should be considered as a Covid-19 positive case, based on a consensus derived from different laboratories in the country. Dr Bhargava wrote that implementing a Ct value cut-off of 24 will lead to “missing of several infectious patients and increased disease transmission.” Health minister Rajesh Tope told TOI that it has now been decided that those with a Ct value over 35 will be declared Covid-negative. He, however, did not respond to a query on why Maharashtra had sought a clarification on the Ct value in the first place. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state Covid-19 task force, said there should not be an over-reliance on the Ct value while treating patients. It's only useful as a diagnostic cut-off and has been reassessed over the past one year, he said. Originally, the ICMR had fixed the threshold at 40 and now it has been revised to 35. "It does not have any relevance for public health or clinical use,” Joshi said. He said, “The rapid antigen tests come back negative for CT value between 24 and 35. We need to do more and more RT-PCR tests. When there is a large population of asymptomatic patients involved, the question is whether they can be spreaders or not. There is a possibility they can be. Lowering the threshold will reduce the so-called 'case-demic'. At the same time, those who need care should be quarantined and treated. The idea is to get the right population." Dr Suhas Pingle, former IMA (Maharashtra) secretary, said other factors, besides just the Ct value, should be considered while treating Covid patients. "As clinicians, we consider a patient’s premorbid condition, age, symptoms and severity of infection. The RT-PCR is a diagnostic tool. From the public health point of view, the rapid antigen is a good screening test, but it also throws up a high number of false negatives. The RT-PCR tests are done when someone comes in with a cold, cough, fever or related symptoms,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ct-value-should-not-influence-treatment-course-docs/articleshow/82021674.cms||---

A new statue of Mahatma Jyotiba Phule has been established in a new place by replacing it from Bais Godam Circle. The height of the installed statue is about 9’3 “feet and weighs 1,050 kg and is made from Ashtadhatu. This statue is installed on a pedestal of 7 feet with railing and chain link, planting of bollards etc. Moreover, a four-lane ROB has been constructed at Jaipur Crossing Gate-102 / 2E, Jahota on Jaipur-Sikar railway line by Jaipur Development Authority. This project costs around Rs 42 crores Due to repeated closure of railway level crossing gates, the traffic coming from Swapna Lok Anand Lok I & II, Kaladera Industrial Area and other places had to face difficulties which is why this ROB was a necessity. Another ROB at the level crossing LC-70 located on the Jaipur-Sawai Madhopur railway line by the Jaipur Development Authority was built that costs around Rs. 75 crores. With the construction of this ROB, the traffic from Tonk Road to Sitapura Industrial Area and Agra Road will be smoothening, the chances of accidents will be less and the traffic of Jagatpura will get uninterrupted and an alternate route will be created. Similarly, Ramnivas Bagh Underground Parking Phase-2 is being constructed by Jaipur Development Authority where total project cost will be Rs. 94.95 crore, the date of completion of the work is August 18, 2023. In 2013, under the first phase, underground parking for 915 equivalent cars was constructed by the Jaipur Development Authority to solve the problem of parking in the Walled City. In its continuation, two-storey underground parking is being constructed in Ramanivas Bagh in the second phase for parking 1515 equivalent cars under the ground of the ground opposite the Union Football Ground and Ravindra Manch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-unveils-statue-of-phule-inaugurates-3-robs/articleshow/82020934.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan government to recruit 6,000 tourist guides even as many quit the job||JAIPUR: The state government is planning to recruit 6,000 tourist guides at a time when the community is leaving the profession in droves and picking up odd jobs to support their families. Even though, visitors to the monuments increased in the past six months just before the second wave of the pandemic, it was a far cry from the pre-Covid days, forcing many to seek other livelihood opportunities. “I have come back to my village. Now I am engaged in agriculture. There was no point to wait in Jaipur for the tourists arrive. Like me, many people who have depended on foreign tourists have decided to move on with works they never thought they would do,” said Jitendra Singh Shekhawat, president of Federation of Tourist Guides, Jaipur. While Jitendra has gone back to Pitoda, his village in Jhunjhunu district, others have chosen different paths in life in their desperate attempt to support their families. “Some of my friends have become delivery boys, assistants in shops, and insurance agents and the jobs are not rewarding financially nor in terms of satisfaction. Those who depended on foreign tourists, their situation is pretty bad,” said Shekhawat. The situation is also no different for the guides who did domestic. What promised like a slow return to normalcy has again been pegged back by the resurgence of the pandemic. Madan Singh, president of Jaipur Tourist Guide Association, said, “Out of the 900 guides in Jaipur, only 150 get some business. But now that prospect is under threat due to the resurgence of the pandemic.” The visitors to the museums and monuments were people mostly youths. They were less inclined to hire guides. Singh said for them the visits were more of enjoying the open air in the atmosphere of nice history and heritage. Learning about the monuments was not on their priority. “Even those visitors who hired guides, the fees were not more than Rs 200. One could manage to get a single assignment in a day. Those who don’t have any other options, they wait all day long at museums and monuments and request visitors. But now that opportunity is also receding,” added Singh. Recruitment of new guides is futuristic, said Shekhawat. What they need is support to run their families and not turn their back on the profession in which they spent a good part of their lives. “We want the government to support us in some way.

They were waiting for the four bodies to reach the village. Such was the anger of the villagers that the local administration had to seek police protection for handing over the bodies to the bereaved families. A few metres away from the polling booth is Jorpatki village. Hamidul Haq, 28, a mason, who was the first to be killed in the central force firing, stayed here. He is survived by his three-year-old daughter, Hasina Parveen, and a pregnant wife. His septuagenarian father, Dil Mohammad Miyan, hasn’t spoken since he heard the news of his son’s death. “A 14-year-old boy was beaten up by the security personnel, following which my younger brother Hamidul had rushed to the booth barely 30 metres away. He was shot after that. Three other youths of our village also were killed,” said Mansur Ali Miyan. Hamidul’s next-door neighbour, Samiul Miyan, was a first-time voter and another victim of Saturday’s incident. “He was an ex-student of Jorpatki High School and used to work as a helper in a shop. Their financial condition didn’t allow him to study further. He didn’t have any interest in politics. It was so unfortunate,” said Jabirul Miyan, a neighbour. “Preliminary investigation suggests that Hamidul was trying to snatch a firearm from a CISF jawan. The barrel of the gun was pointed towards his chest and in the tussle the bullet was fired. We don’t know whether the trigger was pressed deliberately, or it was an accident.” It is believed that the CAPF has lodged a police complaint. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday indicated that a detailed FIR, with legal help, will also be filed. Police said that a magisterial inquest and post-mortem has been completed. The CCTV cameras in the booth — which was under web surveillance — is reportedly damaged. Amina Bibi, another resident of Jorpatki, claimed that she was in the queue when suddenly a jawan opened fire at them. Villagers were visibly angry at the media. “We kept on saying that the paramilitary jawans shot our villagers unprovoked. Yet the media kept saying that villagers had led an attack on them. That is not true,” said Rashidul Haque, a local. But a few villagers, refusing to be named, did admit that several locals had gathered at the polling station numbered 126.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/a-day-after-firing-deaths-ground-zero-sitalkuchi-seethes-in-anger/articleshow/82020959.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Refund home buyer’s Rs 1.1cr, MahaRERA tells developer||Mumbai: Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRERA) has directed Jangid Constructions to refund over Rs 1.1 crore with 10.4% interest plus stamp duty and registration charges to a flat buyer. The developer had failed to hand over possession of two flats in Thane’s Ghodbunder Road within the stipulated period. In his March 23 order, Madhuv Kulkarni, the adjudicating officer of MahaRERA, also directed the builder to pay the complainant, Kanwal Tikoo, Rs 20,000 as costs within 30 days of the order. In 2015, Tikoo booked two flats in Jangid Galaxy at Ghod-bunder Road. The agreement said that the date of possession would be March 2016. Tikoo had paid 95% of the amount and as there was delay in possession, he filed a complaint before the MahaRERA in 2017. “On the undertaking of the promoter to pay interest till actual date of possession, the complaint was disposed of in December 2017. But the promoter did not pay any interest and as per my client, also changed the layout of the building causing obstructions to air and view. Hence my client had sought refund with interest and compensation,” said Tikoo’s advocate Avinash Pawar. The matter was delayed due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown and was finally heard recently. The promoter replied that he paid a sum of Rs 5 lakh each in respect of the two flats and denied having made any changes in the layout plan as alleged by Tikoo. But the MahaRERA observed that the undertaking to deliver possession by March 2018 has been flouted by the respondent. Consequently, the complainant is entitled to refund of the amounts paid, including stamp duty as it cannot be recovered being time barred. Only payment of Rs 10 lakh will not absolve the respondent, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-refund-home-buyers-rs-1-1cr-maharera-tells-developer/articleshow/82021719.cms||Ahmed Ali

On her birth anniversary, the Mahila Neeti will motivate many others. We realise that an educated woman can motivate the entire household and for this we have also announced provision in the budget. In the schools where there are more than 500 girl students in higher secondary classes, we will establish women’s colleges. In the coming two years, more such institutions will also be opened,” said the CM.Gehlot also spoke about the government’s focus on women’s health and the measures taken to prevent mother-infant mortality rate. He said that the government had started the free distribution of sanitary napkins and awareness campaigns in rural areas to address women’s health issues.The chief minister touched upon other measures taken for women empowerment by the Congress party including the right to vote after independence as well as doing away with the concept of ‘ghoonghat’.The conference was attended by women and child rights minister Mamta Bhupesh as well as social activists, women professionals and others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/new-policy-to-be-a-milestone-in-women-empowerment/articleshow/82020945.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan government working on extending industry benefits to tourism sector||JAIPUR: After prolonged persuasion by the tourism bodies, the state government seems to be heeding to their demand for extending industry benefits to the sector that has been hobbled by the pandemic. The state finance department has communicated to the tourism department to prepare an action plan to offer industry benefits to the hospitality sector. According to a source, the tourism department has already written to energy department, urban development and housing, and finance seeking views on financial implications of the move. “After getting the details from the departments, we will prepare a formal proposal and submit it to the government,” said the official. Industry benefits will include electricity rates, UDH and land taxes which are currently paid by the hospitality sector at commercial rates which are higher. Tourism was declared as an industry in 1989, but the benefits were not extended by states and the units are paying taxes and electricity tariffs at commercial rates. Recently, states like Maharashtra and Karnataka have given the sector the industry benefits. After the lockdown, most of the industry bodies including Hotel, Restaurant Association of Rajasthan (HRAR) and Rajasthan Association of Tour Operators (RATO) have been raising the issue at every forum as the tourism sector struggles to find its feet. “We have met every department and official related to the issue in the government, including the chief secretary and the principal secretary finance and sought their support to resurrect the sector that has been badly hit by the pandemic,” said Kuldeep Singh Chandela, president of both HRAR and RATO. The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has again clouded the prospect of the industry that was beginning to recover. Executives in the hotel industry said after the travel restrictions and night curfews, cancellations of booking have been increasing in the past few days. Sources in the industry said that going by the importance the sector has been accorded in the Budget 2021-22, they were hopeful of the sector getting industry benefits. “After all, the most powerful persons in the government are in charge of the tourism department. While the chief minister is the cabinet minister for tourism, the Pradesh Congress Committee chief is the state minister of the department. That’s the reason why the sector got a budget allocation of Rs 500 crore, which is the highest in the history of the department. And it is likely that the government would also offer industry benefits which have been pending for 31 years,” said a representative of the industry. As per industry estimates, energy costs account for a significant part of a hotel’s operating expenses ranging from 15-35%. It is the second highest expenses after manpower cost. Additionally, whether a hotel or restaurant consumes electricity or not, it has to pay a fixed tariff. During the lockdown, these units remained shut. Despite having no business income, they had to pay the fixed energy cost which further added to their woes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-working-on-extending-industry-benefits-to-tourism-sector/articleshow/82020951.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad Cricket Association meeting ends in chaos over confirming ombudsman||HYDERABAD: Chaos prevailed at the 85th deferred annual general body meeting (AGM) of the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) on Sunday with the two rival groups appointing their own ombudsman, despite the Telangana high court upholding the appointment of Justice (retd) Deepak Verma as the ombudsman and ethics officer. Shouting and heckling was the order of the day and it was no different from the meeting on March 28 as charges and counter-charges flew thick and fast over the appointment. While president Mohammed Azharuddin claimed to have ratified the appointment of Justice Verma as the ombudsman after putting the issue to voice vote, the other group led by vice-president John Manoj claimed they have appointed Justice (retd) Nisar Ahmed Kakru as the ombudsman after Azhar walked out of the meeting. Some members demanded the suspension of secretary R Vijayanand and others against whom the high court had passed severe strictures, leading to acrimonious scenes. The situation turned for the worse with several members asking for a vote to be taken. President Azharuddin, who chaired the meeting, called for raising of hands and ratified the appointment, which didn’t go well with the opposition. Azhar then closed the meeting and went out with his supporters. The aggrieved members continued with the meeting under the chairmanship of vice-president Manoj and made a few appointments of their own, including that of the ombudsman. They appointed Justice (retd) Kakru, who was the chief justice of the AP High Court, as ombudsman and Justice (retd) T Meena Kumari, who was the first chief justice of the Meghalaya high court, as the ethics officer. Their Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) will consist of MV Narasimha Rao, Shravanthi Naidu and Sudeep Tyagi. The members also appointed Ethesham Ali Khan as chairman of the Junior selection committee with Anwar Ahmed, Ashwin Yadav, Indrasekhar Reddy and Habeeb Ahmed as the other members. The Cricket Talent Committee will have Arshad Ayub, Noel David, Vivek Jaisimha and Diana David. They also decided to send former BCCI interim president N Shivlal Yadav as HCA representative to the BCCI. Azhar, however, was clear in his stand. “Justice Verma will be the ombudsman of HCA. The members gave their assent by raising of hands as some members called for voting. The main contention was the appointment of Justice Verma and I assured the house that nothing untoward is going to happen. Whatever the rules are, he will follow it as he is a Supreme Court judge,” Azhar said after the meeting. He also termed the meeting that continued after he left as illegal. “They are having another meeting as some members are not accepting the decision. But it is going to be an illegal meeting. Once I closed the meeting, it cannot be held again. They can have 100s of meetings and voting but nothing will change,” he said. The president also asserted his right to represent HCA at the BCCI. “I am going as HCA representative to the board. Everything was done democratically like the appointment of the CAC comprising Venkatapathi Raju, Purnima Rau and Sudeep Tyagi. Only the selectors were not appointed. There were some unruly elements who tried to disrupt the meeting and alleged personal things which are not in good taste,” he added. Countering Azhar, John Manoj, who was flanked by the other Apex Council members, said: “The president walked off from the meeting without completing the Agenda and making the appointments. Therefore, we continued with the meeting as a lot of decisions had to be taken. The members have approved the new appointments by an overwhelming majority. There were more than 120 members in the meeting even after Azhar left.” John claimed the majority was on their side. “The majority is with us and they decided against Verma. We are going by the majority opinion and making new appointments. The secretary will send the report to the BCCI and let’s see what the board has to say. We will have to abide by what the board says.” Azhar also said he will apprise the board of what happened at the AGM. “I will write everything to the BCCI. I will tell the officials whatever has happened till now. They (BCCI) are not very happy with what is going on in HCA as it is bringing disrepute to BCCI. It’s the BCCI which funds the association and hence they have every right to question us. I am ready to answer any question. If we continue to behave like this, we’ll get no funds. Then we will have to shut the association.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hca-meeting-ends-in-chaos-over-confirming-ombudsman/articleshow/82022484.cms||Solomon S Kumar

The matter came to light after a government high school teacher circulated a video on April 6 on the 'marriage' of the Class VIII student against her will and the torture faced by her. Following this, the revenue police of Chamoli probed the matter which was later transferred to regular police. The police team traced the location of the man, identified as Gopal, to Dehradun. He was arrested from Bhagat Singh colony of the state capital. After the arrest, the accused was taken to Chamoli for further questioning. Earlier, the revenue police had lodged an FIR under various sections of Juvenile Act, Pocso Act and section 376 (rape) of the IPC against the father, husband and unidentified middlemen involved in the matter. The Class VIII student said that she had been raped and tortured for a year. Her elder sister had also been 'married' before she turned an adult. Their mother had died a few years ago and the father is a daily wager.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/man-who-married-14-year-old-girl-of-chamoli-for-rs-6k-arrested-from-doon/articleshow/82020169.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Kolkata||Boy injured near booth awaits treatment money||Sitalkuchi: The Saturday morning bloodbath at Sitalkuchi poll booth No. 126 has seen barbs being exchanged between TMC and BJP top brass but the 14-year-old boy is still undergoing treatment at Mathabhanga Hospital and waiting for his USG and CT scan, for which his parents don’t have the money required. The injury and hospitalisation of the boy led to an alleged acid attack on the central forces who, in their “self defence”, gunned down four persons. Minal Haq, a Class-VIII student of Bochagari Madrasa at Mathabhanga in Coochbehar, said he was playing on the road with some friends around 9.30am on Saturday, around 800 metres from the nearest voting centre at Amtali Madhyamik Siksha Kendra, when a team of central forces arrived at the spot in a QRT vehicle. “I was under the impression that it would be wrong to play on the road on an election day, so I ran with my friends. Cops chased and caught me and began asking me questions in Hindi. Maybe they didn’t understand what I was saying and they hit me with a baton on my waist and spine and I fell on the ground, vomiting,” Haq told TOI from the hospital bed at the male medicine ward of Mathabhanga state general hospital. His father Majid Miyan, a daily labourer, said that some locals had rushed to him on seeing the condition of his son. They informed the central forces that he was a local boy and then they took him to the hospital in their vehicle. “By the time my son reached the hospital, it was spread by the word of mouth in the village that central forces had brutally assaulted my son. As I reached the hospital, I came to know that some villagers attacked the central forces out of anger. The cops had fired at the villagers and four of them were killed,” said Miyan while he was sitting on the floor beside his son’s bed at the hospital. The family is now scared of even going back to their village. “So many lives have been lost. I have heard the men and women had attacked the cops, thinking my son had even died of the assault. We feel guilty as the innocent lives were lost while they were demanding justice for my son,” said the boy’s mother, Rahila Bibi. Amongst the series of police queries and visits from political leaders, what is bothering the family most is the cost of treatment for the boy, which they can’t bear. “Doctors have conducted an X-Ray but haven’t found anything unusual. They have asked us to get a USG and CT scan of his abdomen done. It needs to be done from outside but we don’t have money for it. Doctors have even referred him to the district super speciality hospital but we can’t even pay for the ambulance,” said Miyan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/boy-injured-near-booth-awaits-treatment-money/articleshow/82020967.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya

The cumulative vaccination rose to 99,84,268 in the state, just short of one-crore mark, among those 88,02,874 are first dose vaccinations and 11,81,394 are second dose vaccinations. On April 7, the state had set a record of vaccinating 5,81,299 doses, but since then the health department had to scale down the vaccination drive as the stock almost went dry. Till Sunday morning, the state had around 2.5 lakh doses and out of those, 1.1 lakh have been vaccinated. The state is left with around 1.4 lakh doses. But the state received 4 lakh doses in the morning supplied by the Centre, which provided relief to the health authorities. The vaccines now have been sent to Alwar, Dausa, Jaisalmer, Barmer and some other districts. Since the vaccine doses are being supplied in small amounts from the Centre, the health department had to reduce the number of vaccination centres across the state. On April 7, the state had organized 4,129 sessions, which have now been reduced to 1,296 as it has been decreasing for the past four days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-receives-4-lakh-doses-to-keep-vax-drive-on/articleshow/82020960.cms||---

Barring shops selling essential commodities, all other stores remained closed and barely any activity was observed through the day. It was a rare sight for places such as Laxmi Road, Tulshibaug and Mahatma Phule Mandai that are usually buzzing with shoppers on a Sunday ahead of Gudi Padwa, when people step out to buy new clothes, puja items, and so on, to be completely unoccupied. All shops at Karve Road and Ravivar Peth, which largely include jewellery stores, were also shut without any people in sight. Swargate and Camp, hubs for families and youngsters to hang out on weekends, were also vacant. Wholesalers too decided to adhere to the lockdown and stayed home, with no business activity happening at Marketyard. “I thought groceries would be available today, but the shops in my area were closed. However, I managed to get what I wanted through delivery apps,” said Koyna Shah, a resident of NIBM Road. “Medical shops were allowed to remain open, but only four to five walk-in customers came today. People were uncertain about the rules of the weekend lockddown, so they preferred to stay at home,” said a medical shop owner from Undri. At Dattawadi, some youngsters were spotted taking advantage of empty roads and enjoying an afternoon walk, while maintaining social distance. Peth areas of the city, which are otherwise crowded on Sundays, were taken over by the children to play cricket. The traffic on the roads largely consisted of delivery agents on their two-wheelers. On Sunday, police personnel were seen patrolling roads and streets. Officers were also assigned to nakabandi operations. Police personnel from Samarth and Cantonment police stations patrolled their areas on bicycles. Joint police commissioner Ravindra Shisve told TOI, “We seized about 50 two-wheelers belonging to persons, who ventured out on Saturday without any valid reason. The action continued on Sunday also but very few people ventured out of their residence on Sunday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-impound-50-vehicles-city-roads-remain-deserted/articleshow/82020969.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Order on public gatherings gives officials teeth, crackdown starts||NEW DELHI: Amid a massive surge in Covid-19 cases, district authorities are now focussing on heightened surveillance of active cases and a major crackdown on violators not following safety norms to tackle the alarming pace with which the virus is spreading. “The orders by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Saturday against public gatherings have given us some teeth to enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour more stringently. Apart from the strategy of testing, tracing, containment zones, surveillance and awareness, there has been a new-found energy where enforcement is concerned,” a district official said. The DDMA, in its order, has prohibited all social, entertainment, cultural and other gatherings. It has capped the number of people who can attend funerals at 20 and marriages at 50, till April 30. A curfew between 10pm and 5am is already in place till month end. “We are following all instructions to arrest the spread of the disease and there has been a further spike in the number of challans issued for not wearing face masks and violating other safety norms, such as spitting in public or not maintaining social distancing,” he said. “The curfew is also working out well and everyone is working very hard to implement it. Officials of the district administration ensure that the shops close down in time and the curfew is fully enforced,” said the official on condition of anonymity. District authorities are keeping a close watch on public gatherings ahead of some of the upcoming festivals. “We would ensure that during the coming festivals, Covid-appropriate behaviour is stringently followed. We would be regulating these gatherings very strictly. There is no complete ban on visiting many public places and we have to ensure that all safety norms are followed,” another official said. “We have been carrying out extensive enforcement drives at markets and other public places where people usually congregate,” he said. District officials said that apart from testing and enforcement, a major emphasis is also on scaling up vaccination in respective districts. “The number of vaccination centres is being increased and we are also ensuring that the turnout is high,” he said. “Not only hospitals, but every dispensary, private hospitals and healthcare centres are also being used as vaccination centres,” he said. “We have already intensified surveillance efforts and increased Covid awareness drives in super-spreader areas like weekly markets, cinema halls, shopping malls and places of worship. Random testing of passengers arriving at railway stations and ISBTs has also been intensified,” he said. Shahdara district authorities had started random testing of passengers at Anand Vihar ISBT after they disembarked from buses near UP border earlier last year, even before the ISBT reopened. The testing has been further intensified there as also at Kashmere Gate and Sarai Kale Khan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/order-on-public-gatherings-gives-officials-teeth-crackdown-starts/articleshow/82021738.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC vows to plug gaps at airport as travellers into city skip quarantine||Mumbai: BMC has tightened hotel-quarantine monitoring after reports of instances in which international passengers arriving at Mumbai airport avoided mandatory hotel quarantine by paying bribes. There were also complaints from passengers who were offered exemption from quarantine provided they coughed up a small sum. Civic authorities have now decided to check all hotel premises used for quarantine twice a week to plug such gaps in containment. All overseas passengers have to undergo 7-day institutional quarantine before isolating themselves for another seven days at home.Some days ago, a woman who returned from a Gulf nation opted for a star hotel arranged by BMC on a concessional rate for institutional quarantine, but on reaching there she was told the tariff was nearly double what was initially told. She tried to find another hotel listed by the civic corporation and while in transit in a BMC-arranged vehicle, its driver suggested that she pay him Rs 10,000 and evade quarantine altogether.In another such instance, a woman identified as Piya Udasi circulated a video on social media alleging that civic staff deployed at the airport were coercing passengers into paying bribes by threatening to send them into quarantine otherwise; she cited her brother’s example as a case. The BMC had filed a case against her brother for escaping hotel quarantine after the video went viral.Additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu said, “After recent media reports related to a similar incident, we have tried tightening the situation and issued revised protocol also. We asked ward officers to check all cases of last one week’s arrival. We have already filed two FIRs against those who escape quarantine.”Another BMC official agreed it was the responsibility of BMC teams to ensure people exiting the airport after opting for hotel quarantine check into such facilities and stay for the mandated period.Despite such violations, BMC has rarely acted against its own staff who allow passengers to evade the rules. An officer admitted, “We normally act against the passenger for not following the mandatory hotel-quarantine, but our officials are equally accountable for helping such people.”An assistant municipal commissioner said, “We are now checking hotels providing quarantine twice a week in our ward to ensure that the international passenger who has arrived follows the rule.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-vows-to-plug-gaps-at-airport-as-travellers-into-city-skip-quarantine/articleshow/82022497.cms||Vijay V Singh

Aakansha Sadekar, a working professional, shared a tweet stating that even though she is a simple cook, she can drop off home cooked meals for free to medical professionals or students living in the city so they don’t have to survive on instant noodles. “I was already cooking and sending meals for my cousin who is living in a hostel. When I saw a tweet by a medical professional about how he feels helpless after reaching home past 8pm and not getting any food deliveries in his area, I figured I can offer food to those in need so they can work with at least one thing off their minds,” she said, adding that she received requests for free home-cooked meals from 40 people who could not afford to order food from restaurants every day and have no means to make their own meals. Her domestic help does the cutting and chopping while she does the rest of the cooking and delivers it to the people in her car. “This weekend I could not do it due to the restrictions,” she said. Siddhant Kamble, owner of BTech Khau Galli in Wagholi, decided to turn things around when his restaurant business took a hit due to the lockdown and curfew restrictions, by launching an initiative to encourage people to sponsor economy meals for people in slum areas. “Many people want to help, but don’t know how to. Since we had the resources and a set up, we decided to make nutritious meals with rice, dal, sabji, roti and something sweet, and ask people on social media to sponsor these meals, each at Rs 50, which will be distributed to labourers and daily wage workers who live in the slum area of Kesnand Phata. In five days, we distributed 620 sponsored meals, with a daily average of 60-70 meals. We already have meals sponsored that will be distributed over the next 10 days. We plan to take this initiative to other slum areas of Pune where families are starving due to job loss and no income. Other restaurant owners from Wakad have got in touch wanting and are offering their cloud kitchen for this project,” he said. Nirmay Chhajed, founder of Whatzo, has a delivery service that can easily be used by senior citizens through WhatsApp. “All they need to do is send a ‘Hi’ to our number and tell us what they require, we will book a delivery agent who will collect medicines, grocery items, laundry and so on, and bring it to their doorstep. Initially, the service was free, but now we charge Rs 25 that goes to the delivery agent in full,” said Chhajed. During the weekend lockdown, they had serviced 63 orders, mostly of tiffin collection and delivery of food parcels and medicines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/curbs-spur-food-offers-for-students-medical-staff/articleshow/82021008.cms||---

Slogans on the placards read like “Bullet Revenge by Ballot”, “Shanti Zindabad”, “Manush Boro Sasta Ei Mrityu Upatyakae”, “E Amar Desh Noe”. The leaders of the march, ministers Bratya Basu and Indranil Sen, artist Suvaprasanna, musician and TMC supporter Kabir Suman, were followed by a few hundred people who protested against the CISF killing at Sitalkuchi on Saturday when the fourth phase of the poll was held. Having termed the incident as a “barbaric act”, they criticised BJP state president, Dilip Ghosh, for his remarks about the incident. “Look at the way the leaders from Delhi are continuously saying that nowhere else such violence happens in the name of elections. They are trying to first incite the violence and then turn the spotlight on us to defame Bengal. I condemn this. Bengal is inclusive in its politics and never peddles violence,” said Bratya Basu. Kabir Suman demanded the resignation of home minister. Another silent march in protest against the incident was led by minister Shashi Panja and Jaya Bachchan at Bagbazar. The Congress and the Left Front too protested against the Sitalkuchi firing and Dilip Ghosh’s remark. “He is trying to divide the voters with such statements, shifting the focus from everyday issues of common people,” said Sujan Chakraborty, Jadavpur’s CPM MLA. Congress MP, Adhir Chowdhury, said, “A few days ago, the commission had said that if required, the central force can even open fire. We saw it in the fourth phase!” “On Sunday, protest meetings were organised in Cooch Behar. On April 12, it will be carried out across Bengal,” said state secretary, Chandidas Bhattacharya. Meanwhile, Catholic churches that held prayers for Divine Mercy Sunday prayed for peaceful polls. “The violence at Sitalkuchi has shocked us. We hope peace comes back and the rest of the phases happen smoothly,” said vicar general, Dominic Gomes. Bishop Paritosh Canning, head of the Church of North India (CNI), said, “We have to realise that when we kill a person, we destroy God’s creation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/protests-against-cisf-firing-during-poll-held-across-city/articleshow/82021009.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

In a demi-official letter addressed to Punjab’s health secretary Hussan Lal, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan has conveyed that additional manpower must be deployed on priority. He also pointed out shortage of health workers in Patiala, Mohali and Ropar. These nine districts are Amritsar, Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Mohali, Ropar, Patiala, Nawanshahr and Gurdaspur. “The Union government has also taken a note of issues related to vaccine availability and required action to augment supplies based on available stock,” said Bhushan. The Union health secretary also conveyed that the central team had reported that the hospital’s bed occupancy rates in Mohali, Jalandhar and Ludhiana districts were on the higher side and suitable arrangement must be made by the district health authorities with sufficient lead time to prepare for any surge in cases. The central team has also noted that low rates of testing had been reported from Patiala and there was no RT-PCR testing laboratory in Ropar. It has also been pointed out that there was no dedicated Covid hospital in Mohali and Ropar districts, and patients were being referred to neighbouring districts or Chandigarh. The central team also reported lack of any Covid care centre in Ropar. The team has also pointed out various issues regarding procurement of ventilators in Nawanshahr district. In Ropar, although ventilators are available, these are not being optimally used due to shortage of healthcare workforce, particularly doctors and nurses. “Contractual hiring of health care workers would go a long way in addressing this,” the Union health secretary has said. The Punjab health secretary informed that the central team which toured Patiala and Ludhiana districts had reported slow pace of Covid-19 vaccination among persons above 45 years (with co-morbidities) and those above 60 years. “This needs to be addressed on priority,” reads the letter. The central team has also highlighted lack of Covid-appropriate behaviour by people and suggested stricter ground-level enforcement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/punjab-govt-needs-to-enhance-contact-tracing-says-central-team/articleshow/82024047.cms||---

---||Surat||Denied hearse, Gujarat man takes mother’s body on hand cart||SURAT: Running out of options to carry the body of his mother to the crematorium, a banking professional in Olpad village of Surat had to use a handcart for the 60-year-old woman’s final journey, after the panchayat flatly refused to give him a hearse on Saturday night. Panchayat members refused Parin Shah (27) the hearse as his mother Bhadra succumbed to Covid-19. Not only that they also were against allowing him to use the village crematorium for Covid-19 positive people, but after a long fight the deceased’s family got the keys. Videos of the body being carried in a handcart also went viral on social media. Shah’s mother died at 7pm and as she was a Covid victim, family and neighbours insisted that the body should be cremated at the earliest. Shah struggled for the van for over three and half hours and frustrated he took the body on the handcart. “The crematorium is around 3km away from my home. Since my mother was Covid-19 positive, we did not ask relatives to join in large numbers and it was difficult for only four people to take her for cremation without a vehicle,” Shah told TOI. Kamlesh Patel, vice-president of Olpad Gram Panchayat, however, said that the van is defunct and is in the garage. “We don’t give permission for cremation of Covid-19 bodies in our crematorium. It can infect other people in the village. Hence, I denied giving them the keys to the crematorium,” he said, adding that they should have taken the body to Surat city for cremation in a gas furnace. Shah who alleged that his mother did not get treatment or testing facility as well, said, “The panchayat leaders are lying about the van. Further the vice president gave the crematorium key only after pressure by other elders of the village. My mother had kidney disease. When she started facing breathing problems we tried to get her tested but the local health centre said it would take two days for the report.” Shah further said that he tried to search for a hospital with a ventilator but failed to get one and eventually she died from lack of proper medical care.

Those visiting the state need to carry a negative RT-PCR report, not earlier than 72 hours, from April 16. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur made the announcement while presiding over a meeting with senior officers to review the Covid-19 situation in the state. He said the government has allowed tourist arrivals but they, and also hotel owners, need to strictly adhere to the standard operating procedures. Stressing on the twin strategy of testing, tracing and treatment with effective surveillance of micro-containment zones, he said greater emphasis must also be laid achieving the target of 70% RT-PCR tests. The state health department must increase bed capacity and ensure minimum wastage in vaccine, he added. During the last 45 days, the state had reported 10,690 new Covid-19 cases and 120 deaths. The CM said they had allowed devotees to visit temples during the navratras, but completely banned organising langar, bhandara and jagran. All devotees were allowed to visit the temple for darshans and to perform puja, while maintaining social distancing and wearing face masks. No overcrowding would be allowed in buses and other public transport and private vehicles, the CM said. Laxity shown by the people has resulted in sharp resurgence of Covid cases in the state, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rt-pcr-must-for-visitors-from-pb-6-other-states-to-hp/articleshow/82021788.cms||---

The Indian Medical Association said a helpline would now be set up using the expertise of these volunteer doctors to support smaller facilities that are dealing with the pandemic. Many of these small hospitals are experiencing a serious shortage of skilled personnel with some even requesting recovered relatives to help out with patient care. The IMA said the city’s vast number of private medical professionals is an invaluable resource. “There are 5,000 medical practitioners running clinics in the PMC areas. We appeal to them to come forward to help the small private hospitals that are treating Covid patients in their areas,” said Balasaheb Deshmukh, the newly elected president of the IMA’s Pune branch. Sanjay Patil, chairman of the IMA’s Hospital Board of India (HBI), said, “We are going to start a helpline for small and medium-sized hospitals treating Covid. We are urging doctors to extend their services while managing their own clinics to help these facilities that are currently overburdened with limited skilled personnel.” Doctors who are willing can work online or on-site by assisting in medical management or by performing other administrative duties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ima-to-start-helpline-to-support-small-hospitals-treating-covid/articleshow/82021017.cms||Umesh Isalkar

While no vaccination took place at the state capital’s biggest hospital, Doon Hospital, on Sunday, health department officials said that 1.4 lakh doses of Covishield have arrived at the facility and the drive would resume in a full-fledged manner on Monday morning. According to the health department data, 45685 people were vaccinated on Saturday followed by 29719 on Sunday. Sources said that many had to be turned away in districts like Dehradun, Nainital, Tehri and Chamoli due to vaccine shortage. Authorities at the Doon Government Medical College confirmed that both the Covid vaccination booths at the facility remained shut on Sunday as there were no doses. Dr Ashutosh Sayana, GDMCH principal, said, "We had to stop the administration of the vaccine on Sunday. We have been told that the doses will arrive by Monday." National Health Mission director Dr Saroj Naithani told TOI that the state has requested for at least 10 lakh doses of vaccine for the next fortnight and the stock is likely to arrive in batches. “We received 1.4 lakh doses on Sunday and the stock was immediately rushed to various districts. The inoculation will start in a full-fledged manner on Monday. We will place a fresh request again on Tuesday," he said. According to the health department data, the state has received over 14.6 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccine, Covishield, till date, of which over 13 lakh have been utilised so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/covid-vaccine-drive-hit-for-second-day-due-to-limited-supplies/articleshow/82020228.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Kochi||Customs seizes liquefied gold from passenger at Kochi airport||KOCHI: Customs air-intelligence unit officer on Sunday intercepted an air passenger, a Kannur native with ‘bottled gold’ at the Cochin International Airport Ltd, foiling an attempt to smuggle gold using a unique method. Officers seized five bottles, which had a compound of liquefied gold and juice, from him. Source said that the ‘juice’ bottles were kept in the check-in baggage of the passenger who came from Dubai in a flight that landed in Kochi around 1.30am. “At a single glance it can be mistaken for bottles of juice. However, during scanning, the officers became suspicious and during further inspection it was found that the liquid contained a mixture of gold,” said a source. He added that the exact quantity of gold content in the mixture can be known only during lab examination. “They must have processed the mixture with the intention of extracting the gold at the destination. Now, the gold has to be extracted from the mixture at the laboratory. The weight of the entire seized contraband is above a kilogram but the quantity of gold could be anything between 800g to nearly a kilogram,” the source said, adding that the value of the seized contraband can be anything between Rs 30 to 50 lakh. Though there have been several instances where the metal has been seized in paste form by customs authorities, this could be the first time when the smugglers have hidden it completely in liquid. Gold is brought in by smugglers in compound form to try and beat the metal detectors. The yellow metal is converted into a paste form with the help of experts before the smuggling. Usually, the compound is then kept in plastic wrapping and hidden in jackets, handbags and even by taping it on to body parts. Once it arrives at the destination, pure gold is extracted from the compound with the help of experts. In this case, source said, the compound was poured into the juice and was being smuggled in the guise of liquid. Though the compound can beat the metal detectors at times, officers have been able to foil several such attempts even when it is brought in compound form. Source said that apart from specific intelligence, random inspections based on suspicions also lead to the seizures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/customs-seizes-liquefied-gold-from-passenger-at-cial/articleshow/82021021.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Misleading poll posts under FB, Twitter scanner||Kolkata: Twitter and Facebook have started adding new features that can block wrong information and the posts that may influence the voting process. The primary focus of the two social media giants is to prevent netizens from being misled while casting their votes. Given the unprecedented number of social media posts before the polls and on the polling day, both the social media companies have geared up to tackle the issue. Even more challenging, however, is the implementation of these policies and plans. “During Covid-19, we’re also focused on preventing new forms of potential voter suppression,” said Natasha Jog, elections integrity lead, Facebook (India and South Asia). Bihar election was the first during the pandemic and social media witnessed new forms of potential voter suppression. For example, a claim on the social media that a voter will contract Covid-19 if the person goes to a booth and presses a button to vote. “In such cases, we will remove the explicit claims,” Jog said. In 2019, both Facebook and Twitter had adopted self-regulatory code with the Election Commission of India (ECI). The same code is being applied in Bengal elections too. Twitter is using mechanisms that include labelling and reducing the visibility of the tweets containing false or misleading information. “We have prioritized our approach to tackle misinformation that is harmful in the context of the elections, so we focus on synthetic and manipulated media and civic integrity,” said Payal Kamat, manager, public policy, Twitter India. Synthetic and manipulated media includes the posts containing manipulated photos and videos that can leave a wrong impression about someone or something in the minds of people. Once these are spotted, Twitter will label those as manipulated media. There will also be links to outside sources that will show how the media has been altered. Misleading claims like the polling places are closed, polling has ended or votes not being counted will immediately come under scanner. Twitter has already placed a global, cross functional team with local, cultural and language expertise. Their role is to keep the content safe from attempts to manipulate the platform and prevent inciting violence, abuse and threat. Facebook is taking a three-part approach to weed out misinformation. While any content that violates “community standards” is removed, distribution for the contents with questionable authenticity has been reduced. False or partly false content on the Facebook and Instagram is prominently labelled so that people can decide whether to trust or not. “We even get signals from comments to predict if a content is potentially false or misleading. Comments like “no way can this be real” or people marking something as false are signals to question the authenticity of a content,” said Jog. Facebook works with eight partner groups in India and they cross-check contents from 11 languages, including Bengali. Meanwhile, Twitter has launched a multilingual information search prompt with the ECI to provide reliable information around the elections. “We will also be launching a series of pre-bunks and de-bunks to tackle election-related misinformation,” said Kamat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/misleading-poll-posts-under-fb-twitter-scanner/articleshow/82021023.cms||Rohit Khanna

With sudden spike in Covid-19 cases across the nation, the tourism in Himachal is suffering its brunt with just a few tourists heading to the hill state. The lockdown-like conditions are set to affect the tourism for the second consecutive season. Hoteliers in Himachal are demanding opening of Rohtang pass soon as it is their only hope of attracting tourists. According to officials, BRO has already started clearing snow from the Manali-Rohtang highway. The jawans and machines are clearing avalanches at Beas nullah. Marhi, just below Rohtang pass, are expected to reconnect with Manali in a few days. Manali sub-divisional magistrate Raman Gharsangi said, “BRO is clearing snow from road on war footing. Tourists will enjoy snow at Marhi and Beas nullah in a few days.” This year BRO did not clear snow from the pass on priority as Atal tunnel has bypassed this highway. With local residents demanding to open Rohtang pass also, the BRO is expected to restore traffic on Manali-Rohtang-Keylong highway by April end. The pass gets snow almost round the year. This year, however, the area has received very less snow, still the snow depth at some regions is over 20 feet. A BRO official said they are cutting through over 15ft thick layer of snow at Beas nullah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/rohtang-pass-may-open-for-tourists-by-april-end/articleshow/82021792.cms||Suresh Sharma
---||Goa||Goa: Months after reminder, govt websites yet to be updated||PANAJI: Despite two circulars issued by the department of information and technology (IT), most government and semi-autonomous departments continue to ignore the directives to update their websites. The lackadaisical approach of several government departments not only exposes the government’s tall claims about e-governance but also denies citizens’ access to essential information during the Covid-19 pandemic. Aside from some of the information being outdated, some of the government department websites are non-functional. Websites for the directorate of urban development, information and publicity and fisheries were either down or redirected to other portals. Though Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate’s son, Rohit, was sworn in as the mayor of the capital on March 30, on the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) website Uday Madkaikar continues to be the mayor. That is not the only site where Madkaikar’s reign continues. On the Imagine Panaji Smart City Development website Madkaikar is shown as the mayor while IAS officer Hemant Kumar as the chief executive officer (CEO) of the Smart City Mission, even though 2011 batch IAS officer Ravi Dhawan took over in December last year. In September and December last year, the IT department issued reminders to government departments and government corporations to update their websites and provide information in a time-bound manner. In February this year, the Investment Promotion Board (IPB) urged government departments to keep the IT department informed about changes to online services, particularly for companies and entrepreneurs such as licenses and clearances, so that IPB can keep investors informed. In July 2018, then chief minister Manohar Parrikar had asked Goa Electronics Limited to monitor all government websites and to ensure that they are kept updated. Despite this, a majority of government departments fail to upload notifications and circulars on their relevant websites. “Section 4 of the Right to Information Act mandates that all information should be uploaded and regularly updated on all government websites,” social activist Aires Rodrigues said. “The lackadaisical approach of the government in not complying with the mandate of the RTI Act defeats the very purpose of the Act which was enacted for the welfare of the masses and meant to usher in transparency in the functioning of government institutions. There is a concern that the websites are intentionally kept non-functional only to deny the public their rightful access to information,” Rodrigues added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/months-after-reminder-govt-websites-yet-to-be-updated/articleshow/82021810.cms||Newton Sequeira

The flight IX 1322 carrying 181 passengers landed safely at Cial around 3am. All the passengers were safely shifted to the terminal and later taken to the Kozhikode airport in another AIE flight by early morning. The aircraft that had departed from Riyadh was scheduled to land at the Kozhikode international airport, but following the detection of technical failures, the pilots were directed to land at the nearest airport, Kochi, further south of the destination. The aircraft touched down at Cial at 3.10am, 30 minutes before its landing time at the Kozhikode airport. Earlier on August 7, 2020, an AIE flight, from Dubai to Kozhikode, overshot the tabletop runway at Kozhikode airport while landing and fell into a trench killing 21 passengers, including the pilots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/flight-makes-emergency-landing-at-cial/articleshow/82021024.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Two protesters jump into Bhakra canal to evade ‘police action’||PATIALA: Police resorted to a lathicharge on protesters seeking jobs at two places in Patiala, with two people at one of the protests jumping into the Bhakra canal to “save themselves”. Divers rescued the protesters. Earlier, unemployed teachers and multipurpose health workers who were protesting jointly under the banner of Unemployed Sanjha Morcha in Patiala on Sunday, were cane-charged by police after they allegedly tried to cross barricades which had been set up to stop them from gheraoing the CM’s home. Police said they resorted to lathicharge after the protesters clashed with cops on duty and injured four personnel, including two women. Police have also registered a case against the protesters under sections of IPC, but no arrests have been made. Though the protest broke up after the lathicharge around 12.30pm near Polo Ground, protesters returned and sat on a protest near YPS Chowk. Police said the protest was called off in the evening, after their meeting was fixed with Patiala MP Preneet Kaur, who is also wife of Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh. Two people jumped into the Bhakra canal during the protest organised by ETT-TET pass unemployed teachers’ union near Passiana. Protesters had initially reached Patiala to gherao CM residence. They claimed that police cane-charged them around 12.30pm near Baradari Garden in Patiala immediately after they started gathering . Protesters claimed that they later moved towards Bhakhra canal near Passiana, where two protesters jumped into the canal around 2.30pm. “Police cane-charged us and injured more than 10 members of our union near Baradari, following which we moved towards Bhakhra canal, around 12km from the city, and staged protest on main road. Police reached there too and tried to overpower us, following which two of us jumped into the canal,” said Sandeep Sama, a functionary of the union.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/2-protesters-jump-into-bhakra-canal-to-evade-police-action/articleshow/82021790.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Waze unit cop held; he knew of plot, destroyed evidence: NIA||Mumbai: The NIA on Sunday arrested one more police official, API Riyazuddin Kazi, in the Ambani explosives and Mansukh Hiran murder case. Kazi, who worked under arrested API Sachin Waze in the crime intelligence unit (CIU), is the fourth individual and third police personnel to be arrested in the case. A special NIA court remanded him in police custody till Friday. The NIA told the court that at Waze’s behest, Kazi destroyed evidence and was aware of the conspiracy. The prosecution argued that the NIA needed to interrogate Kazi on his role in the planting of the gelatin sticks near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence and Hiran’s murder, whose Scorpio was found parked with the explosives on February 25. Kazi is accused of going to Waze’s housing society in Thane under the pretext of investigation and forciblytaking away and damaging the DVR that contained CCTV footage of the Scorpio parked there by Waze for a week before the gelatin sticks were planted. He is also accused of forcibly taking away DVRs from the shops in Thane from where he, at Waze’s behest, got several fake number plates made. Kazi is learnt to have said to the NIA that he had followed Waze’s orders as he was heading the CIU. Sources said that Kazi was cooperating with the investigation and had given leads in the case, and that he might be made an approver. In the CIU, Kazi was part of all high-profile cases in the recent past, including the fake Twitter accounts case, the call centre racket, the TRP scam and the case of dual registration of vehicles involving car designer Dilip Chhabria. Kazi was recently transferred to the local arms unit and, like Waze, is likely to be suspended. In court, public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves, seeking custody for 10 days, said: “The duo [Waze and Kazi] started to destroy the evidence after the case was handed over to NIA on March 8. Kazi was well aware of the entire matter as the Scorpio, whose theft case was registered at Vikhroli police station and later was used in planting gelatine sticks near Antilia, was parked inside Waze’s apartment in Thane, but he did not raise an alarm.” Defence counsel Hasnain Kazi said Riyazuddin Kazi had been made a scapegoat in the case. “My client has maintained a diary entry of everything,” he said. “If he was involved then why would he make a diary entry?” Earlier, another police official close to Waze, assistant police inspector (API) Prakash Howald, had been questioned by the NIA, though he was not arrested. Besides Waze and Kazi, the other two arrested in the case so far are dismissed police constable Vinayak Shinde, who was convicted a few years ago in a murder case, and Gujarat bookie Naresh Gor, who is accused of supplying the SIM cards used by Waze and others to communicate with one another. On March 28, the NIA recovered a laptop, a printer, two hard discs, a pair of number plates, two CPUs and two DVRs from the Mithi river. “The destruction of evidence started immediately on March 8, after the NIA took over the investigation of the two cases from the ATS,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/waze-unit-cop-held-he-knew-of-plot-destroyed-evidence-nia/articleshow/82022506.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Ahmedabad||Cheetahs in Gujarat! Not so fast, says state government||AHMEDABAD: The Centre wants the cheetah, the fastest land animal on the earth, to re-enter India and settle down in Gujarat; but the state’s silence has put the proposal on the snail’s pace track. The last cheetah sighted in India died in 1947 in what is now Chhattisgarh. The animal was officially noted as extinct in the country in 1952. The Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change, through the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), had mooted the introduction of the cheetah into Banni grasslands and the Kutch Wildlife Sanctuary in Gujarat. But the state government has not yet responded to the NTCA or the committee appointed by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court had in January last year formed the three-member committee. It comprised the former director of the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Ranjit Singh; the DG of the WII, Dhananjay Mohan; and the DIG, wildlife, of the Union ministry of environment and forest. The committee’s role was to ‘guide’ the NTCA in the cheetah reintroduction project. Singh, who heads the committee, said: “The ministry has written to the Gujarat government seeking its opinion about the cheetah introduction.” Singh added: “However, we have not got any response so far from Gujarat.” A senior forest department official said that since Gujarat has not responded, the WII and the Wildlife Trust of India may consider Kuno-Palpur in Madhya Pradesh as a site to accommodate cheetahs in India. Officials said that the feasibility report titled ‘Assessing the Potential for Reintroducing the Cheetah in India’ had been prepared by Dr Y V Jhala, a senior scientist at the WII, and his team. Subsequently, it was decided that cheetahs will be obtained from Iran, Namibia, and South Africa. Initially, the central government plans to bring 18 cheetahs from the three countries. The report said that 10 sites were assessed for the purpose. The sites lie in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh. “The Kuno-Palpur Wildlife Sanctuary, a part of the Sheopur-Shivpuri forested landscape, had the second largest area (6,800 sq km) among the surveyed sites,” said a WII Official. “This site is rated high on the priority list for considering the reintroduction of the cheetah because several restorative investments have already been made here for introducing Asiatic lions.” Nauradehi Forest Sanctuary in MP and the Shahgarh area in Rajasthan are among the other contenders on the list of sites. A Gujarat forest official said that cheetahs need open spaces. “They are comfortable in grasslands and Banni seems to be the best place for them in Gujarat.” The official added: “Besides, it also includes the Kalo Dungar area, which has a good number of jackals.” At present, the Banni grasslands have a prey base of 10-12 animals per sq km. To facilitate the return of the cheetahs, the Gujarat government will have to immediately start breeding chitals and sambars to increase the prey base, the official said. Cheetahs need a prey base of about 30 animals per sq km. WII officials said that in Banni grasslands, the wild prey concentration is extremely low as of now. However, the official said, the area has potential and with restoration, livestock grazing management, and law enforcement it could support over 50 cheetahs. “If the Gujarat government takes serious steps to restore this landscape, then the site could be re-evaluated at a later date,” the official said. But at present, the state government does not seem too keen to take up the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cheetahs-in-gujarat-not-so-fast-says-state-government/articleshow/82022509.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

---||Delhi||How Delhi Police are adding teeth to training||NEW DELHI: The training wing of Delhi Police is up for a revamp with commissioner SN Shrivastava taking a slew of measures to change the posting rules and incentivising those who serve there. TOI has learnt that Shrivastava has issued orders for selection of officers to the Police Training Centre through an interview and screening by a board. An officer would also be given a posting of choice after successfully completing three years with the unit. Apart from that, able officers would be allowed to choose an area of specialisation and pursue it in India or abroad based on the collaboration with Bureau of Police Research and Development. The move has been termed as a “game-changer” by several senior IPS officers. They agreed that traditionally the training wing was considered a punishment posting or a unit for those who were either “out of favour” or unsuitable for mainstream and high-profile units. In the last 10 years, several officers, either at loggerheads with the police chiefs or after removal from high-profile posts, have been posted there. Shrivastava’s concept appeared significant in that context, the officers agreed. “At present, the training of policemen is the weakest link and has remained out of focus for years. The result is seen in day-to-day procedures when they deal with the public or handle law and order situations impulsively. Lack of training is quite apparent at times. With incentivising and prioritising the unit and officers, results can be outstanding,” said a retired top cop. Shrivastava told TOI that eligible police officers should be posted in the unit so that meaningful and professional training could be imparted to the trainees. “Such units are responsible for overall personality development and imparting professional training to trainees. Training plays a pivotal role in enhancing one’s performance on the field,” he added. According to the new policy, police officers of all ranks would be selected on a fixed criteria. The officer should be willing to work there and have an aptitude for training. “Officers from any cadre of Delhi Police, like ministerial, communication, etc, can be considered. The applicant should also not have any adverse entries in the last five years. The officer should have served in field units, preferably districts, during his preceding three years of posting,” the document stated. Selected officers would have a tenure of three years, extendable by two years, after which they would be allowed to opt for becoming the “core group” members. Tenure extension would be done after considering overall performance in training. A core group of 15% of the posted strength for promoting specialisation would be created. It would comprise all branches of policing and training. A committee would review the performance of staff every six months on the basis of objective assessment and feedback received from trainees. For this, a standardised trainees feedback proforma would be prepared. Non-performers would be transferred out of the unit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-police-are-adding-teeth-to-training/articleshow/82021041.cms||Raj Shekhar

On Sunday, the administration officials directed owners of all restaurants and multiplexes in the city to install thermal scanners and sanitisers at the entry points of their establishments. They were also told to ensure that social distancing is maintained in their premises. The shopkeepers, along with their workers, have also been asked to wear masks at all times. Also, white circles are again being painted for maintaining social distancing.

Sampath, along with his driver Arun, was attacked and robbed by a gang near Technocity at Pallipuram on Friday night. They were transporting gold from Neyyattinkara to Attingal when the robbery took place. Police questioned Gopakumar and three other persons after it came to be known that Sampath was robbed of cash by Gopakumar and his gang three months ago at Thuckalay. They had come in the guise of cops and robbed him of cash. All of them were arrested and are out on bail. During questioning, police learnt that all of them have been turning up at the station to put their signature without fail. They had clear alibi on the night of theft, which has forced police to rule out any connection between Gopakumar and the theft that happened on Friday night. District police chief P K Madhu said that as of now police couldn’t gather anything to link Gopakumar with the theft. The team is also looking for details of a red-coloured Swift car and white-coloured Ertiga. Although the team took the same route of the gang to collect CCTV visuals, the number plate is not visible on any of the visuals collected so far. Officials said that while the bright headlights made the number plate invisible, lack of night vision cameras gave blurry images for the rear side. Without a number plate, police have not been able to take the investigation forward. Currently, the team is working on collecting mobile phone details which were active in the region and the scene of crime on the night of theft. Police also plan to gather details and sort out numbers which may have been connected to the crime. Sampath had told police that the gang members wore masks and spoke in Malayalam. However, Sampath could not recognize any familiar voices. Police are also not ruling out the possibility of interstate gangs in the theft. Officials have been surprised by the manner in which the gang was able to intercept a vehicle on a busy road and made away with gold without any hindrance. The spot, although being on busy road, was devoid of any houses nearby except for some wayside shops. There were people who drove by and witnessed the incident. But police have not been able to extract anything concrete to identify the gang members. Sampath told the police that he had collected gold from a wholesale dealer in Trivandrum who had transported it from Mumbai. He was on his way to deliver the gold to a shop at Attingal. The police team collected bill details of the gold purchase and confirmed the version of Sampath. Sampath has been settled in Neyyattinkara for the last three decades and he runs a jewellery shop there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cops-quiz-ex-driver-3-others-linked-with-previous-robbery/articleshow/82021032.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cong protests Rs 36cr devpt funds to Sena corporators||Mumbai: A war of words has broken out between the Congress and the Shiv Sena over distribution of District Planning and Development Council (DPDC) funds for Mumbai suburban district. Congress leader Janardhan Chandurkar has alleged around Rs 36 crore of DPDC funds have been allocated to beautification proposals moved by Shiv Sena corporators, while Congress corporators have been left high and dry. Chandurkar alleged DPDC chairperson Aaditya Thackeray, who is the guardian minister for Mumbai suburban, allocated the funds to his party corporators with an eye on the 2022 BMC polls. “Mumbai suburban guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray has passed an order sanctioning Rs 36 crore from DPDC funds to 43 Shiv Sena corporators. This move is not ethically sound as funds have only been sanctioned to Shiv Sena councillors, depriving Congress MLAs and corporators,” Chandurkar said. Officials said while corporators get funds from the BMC, DPDC funds are usually allocated to MLAs and MPs and these funds are provided to Mhada, which is the nodal agency for executing projects from DPDC funds. “The move to allocate funds to corporators is clearly in view of the elections to BMC. I am not against use of funds, but it should be distributed to 227 corporators and not just to Sena corporators,” Chandurkar said. When contacted, Aaditya said funds were allocated to all those who sent their proposals. “Funds distribution is as per norms. Corporators are also part of the DPDC and these funds have been given based on the merit of proposals submitted. We have allocated funds to MLAs and MPs also,” he said. Denying any irregularity, Mumbai suburban collector, Milind Borikar said, “Works are sanctioned as per recommendations of the guardian minister and funds are provided to Mhada for implementation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cong-protests-rs-36cr-devpt-funds-to-sena-corporators/articleshow/82022551.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Kochi||Model code of conduct affects progress of Kochi corp projects||Kochi: Implementation of many of the projects designed by Kochi corporation has been hit due to the model code of conduct which is in place as part of the assembly elections. Though the restrictions as part of the model code of conduct will be lifted in May, relaying of roads and other works may be resumed only after September when the monsoon is expected to be over.Even the cleaning of drains and canals also have been hit. “In the wake of the assembly elections, the state government had given instructions to all the local bodies to complete the designing and presentation of the plan fund projects before the district planning council (DPC) in a time-bound manner. The government brought out a calendar for completing each stage of the works. But, Kochi corporation authorities failed to go by the instructions,” said Congress councillor M G Aristotle. “They couldn’t secure the approval for projects from the DPC. So, we couldn’t start any of the plan fund projects. Even if the restrictions as part of the model code of conduct are lifted in May, the monsoon will set in by June. So, roads will remain unrepaired till September,” Aristotle said. Following a remark by the high court, while hearing a petition, that the ongoing works and those with emergency nature should not be stopped due to the restrictions as part of the model code of conduct, the corporation administration has started the procedures for tendering the canal cleaning works. “We are fast completing the tender procedures for the canal cleaning works. We will be able to start such works immediately,” an official with Kochi corporation said. At the same time, the opposition is alleging that the lethargic attitude on the part of the corporation administration delayed the canal cleaning works. “Earlier, the corporation authorities will seek exemption from the Election Commission for carrying out the works like canal cleaning. This time, the corporation authorities didn’t do that. Had they acted fast, the canal cleaning works could have already been started,” Aristotle said.But, top sources with the corporation said that they had been conducting all the preparations for starting various works once the restrictions as part of the model code of conduct are lifted. “We have prepared detailed plan for streamlining the operations of solid waste treatment plant at Brahmapuram. We are preparing an action plan for avoiding waterlogging in the city. In the past few days, we conducted meetings to review the ongoing works. We conducted special meetings with all the top officials and gave instructions to resume all the works once the restrictions as part of the model code of conduct are lifted,” sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/model-code-of-conduct-affects-progress-of-kochi-corp-projects/articleshow/82021044.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Pune||Pune: Flying squads to check bed occupancy in private hospitals||PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has formed flying squads to check ‘unnecessary bed occupancy’ at private hospitals. The teams will conduct surprise visits at the hospitals to check occupied beds as well as details of patients using them. The patients, who don’t need to be at the hospital, will be urged to vacate beds so that they can be given to Covid-19 patients genuinely in need of hospitalisation. The decision to form the squads has been taken considering the high demand for hospitalization of Covid-19 cases and low availability of beds. 15 squads will work at the ward office level, one squad will be assigned per ward office. “The guidelines are set for providing beds at hospitals during the pandemic. The guidelines must be followed. Any violation in doing so will attract action,” said Ashish Bharati, head of PMC’s health department. The squads will monitor the bed occupancy and ensure that needy people get the beds, he said. As per PMC officials, many people have already occupied hospital beds in anticipation of any adverse effect to their health due to Covid-19. “In most cases, people, who have the financial wherewithal are keeping the beds occupied at some hospitals. These hospitals do not express any objections on unwanted bed occupancy because it is serving their financial interests. Not all, but a few hospitals are following such unethical practices,” said a senior PMC official. The official added that the squads will give a list of people, who can be treated at home, to hospitals. The hospital management will be asked to discharge the patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/flying-squads-to-check-bed-occupancy-at-pvt-hospitals/articleshow/82021038.cms||---

The contracts can be extended as per requirement, an official from the Zilla Parishad’s health department said. The 517 healthcare workers include six MBBS doctors, 46 BAMS doctors and 78 BDS doctors. At present, there are 162 DCHCs, 78 CCCs and nine Dedicated Covid Hospitals (DCHs) at various locations across rural Pune. Mahadev Guhle, the ZP’s deputy chief executive officer, said, “Some of the newly hired staffers has already joined the centres, while the remaining will join soon. The need of additional hiring was felt due tothe surge in Covid-19 cases in rural areas. Now, we have over 900 healthcare workers on Covid-19 duty.” The ZP health department officials said the additional hiring was also prompted by the fact that a substantial number of ZP’s own staff was engaged in the ongoing vaccination programme. Ayush Prasad, the chief executive officer of the ZP, said, “Although the cases have gone up, our case fatality rate is stable at 1.77%. We are focusing more on enhancing the healthcare facilities across the rural areas. More doctors are now engaged in Covid centres to provide timely medical aid to the patients.” The ZP has also decided to hire 55 more MBBS doctors as medical officers for the DCHCs and DCHs. As these doctors will be performing duties in remote areas, the ZP has decided to give them an incentive of additional Rs30,000 per month. “These doctors get Rs60,000 salary per month in urban areas. But, they will be working in tribal and remote villages, mostly located in the hilly region of Bhor, Velhe, Junnar and Ambegaon tehsils. We have decided to hire 20 doctors for these tehsils,” added Ghule.

---||Nagpur||Vaccinated HCWs getting infected but recovering fast||Nagpur: The Covid-19 vaccines taken by doctors and healthcare workers in the state have started showing their intended effect. The vaccine is not guaranteeing 100% protection against the infection but restricting the disease to either asymptomatic or mild symptomatic level in most of the cases reported among healthcare workers. Especially young doctors, who constitute the frontline workforce in government Covid hospitals, and resident medical officers (RMOs) working in private hospitals are not getting severe type of Covid-19 since the last two months, as per the data obtained from government medical colleges across the state. Vidarbha has not reported any death of HCWs due to Covid-19 in the last two months. The data shows that more than 450 resident doctors were infected with Covid-19 during the period February 10 to April 10. These include 62 from Nagpur, 22 from Yavatmal and 13 from Akola. But all of them have either recovered or on the way to recovery in home isolation. “Resident doctors in Maharashtra are working hard in Covid-19 hospitals and the rate of infection among them is high in the second wave. Of the 463 doctors who have been infected, most have recovered. Some of them have again joined duties in their respective hospitals,” said Dr Dnyaneshwar Dhobale Patil, president of central committee of Maharashtra Resident Doctors’ Association (MARD). Administrations in five leading private hospitals in the city told TOI that doctors and healthcare workers engaged in Covid-19 wards and ICUs are getting infected but are also recovering very fast. “Becoming Covid-19 positive has become a normal thing for doctors who work in ICUs or Covid wards. Fortunately, if they get infected after vaccination, they develop either mild or very moderate symptoms. Recovery time has also reduced up to seven days,” said a senior member of Vidarbha Hospitals Association. Many senior doctors like former IMA president Dr YS Deshpande who have tested positive even after getting second dose of vaccine, have recovered without much issues. Healthcare workers including doctors started receiving Covid vaccine from January 16. Most of them completed their second dose by March second or third week. According to experts, severe cases and deaths due to Covid-19 in healthcare providers will further reduce as a positive effect of the vaccine. Vax effect - 463 resident doctors in 19 GMCs in the state test positive in last 2 months - Of them, 38 from GMCH Nagpur, 24 from IGGMCH, 22 from Yavatmal and 13 from Akola - Hundreds of RMOs and HCWs in government as well as private hospitals tested positive - Many treating doctors, senior doctors tested positive but none had serious symptoms - No death of frontline worker due to Covid-19 reported in last two months||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vaccinated-hcws-getting-infected-but-recovering-fast/articleshow/82021814.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Nashik||Maharashtra: Many of Nandurbar villages managed to stay Covid-free||NASHIK: A significant number of villages in Nandurbar district have not registered a single Covid-19 case since the beginning of the pandemic due to various measures taken by the residents. One of the measures is self-isolation — meaning the villagers put up a fence-like structure to prevent anyone from entering the villages. “Out of the 180 villages in Shahada taluka of the district, 75 do not have any active Covid case as of now. Also, five of these 75 villages have not seen a single patient till date. All these villagers have resorted to the practice of isolation by putting up barricades to prevent entry of visitors or outsiders,” said tehsildar of Shahada Milind Kulkarni. The villages in Shahada taluka with no patients whatsoever (Covid or non-Covid) include Bahirpur, Biladi, New Asloda, Kalmad and Tidhare. Despite Shahada and Nandurbar being the most affected by Covid, these villages managed to keep the virus at bay. “Similarly, 74 out of the remaining 105 villages have reported single-digit Covid cases. As instructed by district collector Rajendra Bharud and sub-divisional officer Chetan Girase, the gram rakshak dal (GRD) is doing its job of protecting the villagers,” the tehsildar said. Akrani is another remote taluka in the district with 165 villages. Of the 165 villages, 152 have not reported a single Covid case till date, tehsildar of Akrani taluka Dnyaneshwar Sapkale said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/many-of-nandurbar-villages-managed-to-stay-covid-free/articleshow/82020264.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Delhi||Delhi: Two held for killing transgender for Rs 55-lakh bounty||NEW DELHI: Two criminals, including a notorious shooter, were arrested by Delhi Police’s Special Cell on Saturday for murdering the leader of a transsexual group in September last year. DCP (Special Cell) Pramod Kushwaha said a rival faction had given Rs 55 lakh to the criminals for the contract killing. “While one of the arrested men, Gagan, carried a reward of Rs 1 lakh on his head, the other, Varun, had a bounty of Rs 50,000. Two pistols and five cartridges were seized from them,” he added. Police said Gagan was involved in over 14 cases, including murder, attempted murder, robbery, etc, in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. A team comprising inspector Shiv Kumar and others were on the duo’s trail for about three months. On Saturday, a trap was laid after receiving information about the suspects travelling in a Scorpio to Nirankari Samagam grounds in north Delhi. When the accused were flagged down after being identified by an informer, they started firing at the cops with pistols in a bid to escape. However, they were cornered and arrested. During interrogation, they revealed that one Manzoor Elahi, a member of a group of transgenders, had approached them for killing Ekta Joshi and her stepmother Anita Joshi, the rival faction members, and agreed to pay Rs 55 lakh for the contract killings. An advance payment of Rs 15 lakh was made in three installments to Gagan. On the day of the incident, the two shooters rode on a scooter towards Joshi’s car and fired as soon as she got off. The crime, which was caught on a CCTV camera, had created ripples. Gagan went underground after the incident. “Investigation revealed that the bone of contention between the two groups was domination of the Trans-Yamuna area and for collecting money from people on social occasions,” said Kushwaha. The rival group was headed by Sonam and Varsha of Faridabad and Kamal and Manzoor Elahi of GTB Enclave. When Anita survived the killing bid, the Elahi faction got into a dispute with the criminals over payment. Police are now looking for others who were a part of the conspiracy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-held-for-killing-transgender-for-rs-55-lakh-bounty/articleshow/82021050.cms||---

The arrests were made from various locations, including Andhra Pradesh and Thiruvananthapuram.Senior officers said that tracking down the accused took months of preparation. “Closing investigation after one major seizure is what usually happens. However, in this case district police chief SP K Karthick assigned a special team to get to the bottom of this. Over the past six months of investigation in Andhra Pradesh and Kerala we were able to arrest over 10 persons who were key links in the racket smuggling ganja to Andhra Pradesh,” said a senior officer.The latest person to be arrested in the case was Pallasreenivasa Rao, 26, a major link of the racket in Andhra Pradesh. Police had earlier arrested one Sharafudheen from Visakhapatnam and Jijendran from Thiruvananthapuram who were key players connected with the racket. According to the investigation, the epicentre of the ganja smuggling from Andhra Pradesh was Paderu. The village according to police was a major ganja hub and was the source for the narcotic substances for peddlers in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh. The contraband procured from here was being sold at 15 times the price with which it is procured. “The ganja reaches the racket from Naxal-affected tribal areas. Reaching there itself is a tough task. It is dangerous if people recognize that you are a police officer. Catching a criminal was almost impossible. Still, our teams were able to find success in those areas,” said an officer.Police said that so far they were able to arrest accused persons who were involved with the racket at every level of distribution. “Out of the 10 accused there are gang leaders, carriers, investors, peddlers and even those who store the contraband. The investigation is ongoing and more arrests can be expected soon,” said a senior officer.Police urged the public to share information about peddling and abuse of narcotic substances to curb the drug menace in the district. Identity of informers, police said, would be kept completely confidential.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/six-month-probe-leads-to-arrest-of-key-players/articleshow/82021047.cms||---

While chief minister Pramod Sawant has promised in his recent budget speech that resurfacing and repairs of all roads in the state will be completed before the 2021 monsoon, most of the payments to contractors are pending for road repair works, as per PWD records. In most of the 988 cases, only partial payment has been made and no payment at all has been made to many contractors for supply of tanker water. For the work of strengthening of parking lot and approach road to enter Curchorem town, for instance, records show that the work is pending due to ‘non-availability of funds’. Of the over Rs 1 crore estimated for the work, only Rs 41,000 has been paid so far. Some works have seen the payment not being made to the contractor as ‘bill was returned from director of accounts with observation’, state records. In many cases, the full payment has also not been made to the contractor as there has been no allotment of funds made at all for the work, even though many of these contracts are for essentials like supply of drinking water by tankers to mining-affected areas. No payment has been made to the contractor for supplying drinking water through tanker in the mining-affected areas of Cavrem Maina, Cazur and Mangal in Pirla in Sanguem constituency due to ‘funds not being allotted’, official records state. Similarly, even as the state government boasts of having provided tapped drinking water to 100% rural areas in the state under the Centre’s Jal Jeevan Mission, records show that no funds have been allotted to many other areas where water was supplied by tanker, including parts of Loliem, Dharbandora and even PWD minister Deepak Pauskar’s own constituency of Sanvordem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/988-pwd-contractors-still-wait-for-dues-to-be-cleared/articleshow/82021841.cms||---

Of the total projects worth Rs 1,754 crore, works to the tune of just Rs 584 crore has been completed even after five years since starting smart city project in Kochi. “We are going ahead with the works which we have already been started. Still, the fate of some of the projects which are yet to be started is in the balance,” an official associated with CSML said. “Works of smart roads, including that of Abraham Madamackal Road, will be completed by the end of the month. Works of other roads also are progressing,” the official said. Though the CSML authorities awarded the work on Rs 166 crore vacuum sewer project to be implemented in West Kochi to a private firm, the work couldn’t be started due to protests from the local residents. The sewage project aims at collecting and treating sewage from all the households and other establishments in five divisions of Kochi corporation in Mattancherry and Fort Kochi areas.  When the private firm, to which the work was awarded, conducted soil inspection at the proposed site for the plant near Fort Kochi Taluk Hospital they had to stop the work due to protests by local residents. They fear that their drinking water sources will be contaminated if the pipes carrying sewage leaks. According to the officials, the plant works on vacuum system. “Using the force of vacuum the waste is drawn into the plant through the pipelines. If there is any leak in the pipeline, the system will stop,” an official said.

The state government has approved the revenue sharing model between SCTL and Trida in developing the three projects — rehabilitation block at Palayam (on M block and waste dump site) as part of Palayam market redevelopment, multi-level car parking complex (behind Saphalyam complex) and warehousing complex at Attakulangara, Chalai. These projects are being implemented using smart city mission funds. As per the memorandum of understanding, the share of SCTL will be the cost incurred for project development and annual maintenance contract for five years. Trida’s share will be calculated as twice the cost of land which is being utilized by SCTL for project development. This has been determined as per fair value of land. The revenue generated through lease, rent, parking charges will be shared by both parties after meeting all the expenses for operation and maintenance. In the construction of rehabilitation block at Palayam, Trida’s share would be Rs 22.63 crore while SCTL will bear Rs 40.13 crore. The profit share of Trida and SCTL will be 55.39% and 43.61% respectively.The fair value for automated multilevel car parking facility has been estimated at Rs 12.14 lakh for 86.3 cents. SCTL and Trida will take profit shares of 40.97% and 59.03% respectively.As for the warehousing complex at Chalai, the fair value is Rs 8.09 lakh for 209.7 cents. SCTL will carry a profit share of 35.54% and Trida will get a share of 64.54% for this project. The renovation of Palayam market involves design, supply and installation of prefabricated structure for construction of rehabilitation block of existing vendors, site clearance and construction of new market building at Palayam, design, supply, installation and maintenance of electro-mechanical car parking system within the basement of the proposed Palayam market building. The first two components will be executed at Rs 12.7 crore and Rs 61.05 crore respectively and the third component will cost Rs 8.17 crore. Around 9,624 cubic metres of waste weighing approximately around 4,842 tonnes were removed at Palayam to set up prefab structures for rehabilitation block. The proposed warehouse facility at Chalai will have six huge chambers for storage. One chamber will be used exclusively for cold storage and remaining chambers will be used for general warehouse purpose. The market is badly in need of a warehousing facility and this will be a key step in ensuring scientific and proper storage. Proposed to be built over 2,500 sqm, the warehouse will also address grave concerns of using chemicals to extend the storage life of perishables.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/sctl-trida-to-share-revenue-for-three-smart-city-projects/articleshow/82021060.cms||Aswin J Kumar

---||Delhi||In cue from West, cops to learn new-age techniques||New Delhi: From collaboration with top universities for a hands-on experience to introducing new-age modules with topics like cryptocurrency, Covid-19 management and mental health upkeep — Delhi Police’s new training structure seems to be aiming to bring its personnel on a par with their counterparts in the West. Delhi Police has tied up with the National Law University for training of investigations in law and court proceedings. The modules comprise moot courts being held by retired judicial officers. A collaboration with National Forensic Science University has also been done to train the cops in scientific evidence collection and using forensic tools during probe. A chapter on use of stun-gun has been introduced as well, along with 129 other new-age modules with focus areas like proximate use of force, police station management, perception building and public outreach. Senior officials said that training of officers during the pandemic became a challenge. Stepping up the quality of training was an even tougher task. “Living up to people’s expectation is imperative for every policeman. Making the force more professional to meet the growing challenges, regular induction of new skills in the force through advanced and sustained training has been the foremost objective of Delhi Police,” Delhi Police commissioner S N Shrivastava said. Delhi Police too, like the rest of the world, shifted a majority of the classroom training online and managed to maintain their training schedule. It undertook newer methods of imparting training with minimum need of physical presence. Specialised training units in every districts were strengthened for imparting online training from regular training centres. “Availability of internet connections with good speed, LEDs, multimedia, good sound system for interactive training was commissioned to ensure quality online training. Therefore, many policemen could join training courses from wherever they were deployed,” Shrivastava explained. Cops also introduced new courses on functioning of various technological applications such as Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and System, Integrated Complaint Management System, Integrated Criminal Justice System, mobile applications and the e-beat book, which have been launched last year by Shrivastava.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-cue-from-west-cops-to-learn-new-age-techniques/articleshow/82021075.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Coimbatore||Assault on HM man sparks tension||Coimbatore: Tension gripped the city after a Hindu Munnani functionary was assaulted with an iron rod by two unidentified men at Sundarapuram on Saturday night.S Ramakrishnan, 36, of Thayammal Layout at Podanur, is the vice-president of the Ukkadam unit Hindu Munnani. Ramakrishnan is engaged in catering work.When Ramakrishnan was returning home from Kempatti Colony on his motorcycle around 10.30pm on Saturday, two men waylaid him and assaulted him with an iron rod at Sundarapuram Junction. When some shopkeepers in the area came to rescue Ramakrishnan, the assailants escaped.Ramakrishnan suffered injuries on his head and was admitted to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH). Ramakrishnan received six stitches on his head. The Podanur police registered a case under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code and formed a special team to nab the duo.Meanwhile, hundreds of Hindu Munnani members gathered at the CMCH on Saturday night and demanded that police arrest the accused. Some Hindu Munnani cadres stopped three Muslim youths, who were returning home after watching a movie, on the CMCH premises suspecting them that they were spying on them. The cadres attacked the three Muslim youths and damaged their motorcycle.Rahim, 40, of Kottaimedu, who was under the influence of alcohol, was also attacked by a group of Hindu Munnani cadres. The injured Muslim youth lodged a complaint with the Race Course police.Following the incidents, more than 300 police personnel were deployed at various parts of the city to prevent untoward incidents.On Sunday morning, Hindu Munnani announced that its members would besiege the district collectorate to demand the arrest of the accused.

---||Nagpur||Ghats stressed, little space at burial grounds||Nagpur: “What’s the hurry, everyone has to go there one day, even I’ll have to go,” says a NMC staffer deployed at Gangabhai Ghat taking down details of the deceased. This quickly diffuses the harried atmosphere, and relatives outside the small room settle down for a longer wait in line. The scene at crematoria is like a busy government office these days. Relatives wait in queues to complete formalities, pyres can be seen lit all over, and groups of people huddle around almost everywhere. Soon a hearse vans brings another Covid victim. Dressed in PPEs, NMC heath workers try to finish the job without wasting a moment. Sometimes, last rites are not even over when the team gets a call to pick up another body. TOI paid a second visit to the burning ghats and burial grounds after March, to find that life has just got a little more hectic there. The number of dead bodies being brought to the crematoria has gone up nearly four times as compared to January and February. At some burial grounds, soon space may fall short. TOI visited Ambazari, Mokshadham, and Gangabai burning ghats, along with Muslim graveyards at Mominpura and Jaripatka, as well as the Christian cemetery at Jaripatka. Each burning ghat TOI visited is getting 35 to 45 bodies each day on an average. As many has 70% of the deaths are due to Covid. However, staffers also accept non-Covid deaths have also gone up substantially. A couple of months ago not more than a dozen bodies were brought in a day. These days there are 10 to 15 non-Covid bodies out of 35 to 40 corpses each day. There is also a token system in place to manage things. Amid all the chaos, there are chances of some cases escaping the authorities. If a person dies at home, the kin can simply bring the body and get it cremated or buried. At the ghats, TOI was told that all that is needed is a copy of Aadhaar card of the deceased and that of one nominee. Whatever cause is mentioned by the relatives is written down in the register. In case of a hospital death, the kin come along with a death certificate issued from there. In case of Covid, a specific certificate is given. TOI witnessed the case of 36-year-old Amar Bahadure at Gangabai ghat, who had died at home. “It was sudden,” said a relative. All that relatives gave was an Aadhaar copy of Bahadure and that of his nominee. This is the only system for home deaths, said staffers at Gangabai and Ambazari ghats. At Mokshadham, they insist on a witness letter from a couple of neighbours also. “We had instructions from NMC to collect a copy of death certificate also, but not many bring one along. Since the family is grieving, we cannot insist. However, we have made it a rule not to take a body after 9pm, so any mischief is prevented,” said Abdul Qadir of the Qabrastan Committee at Jaripatka. Covid or non-Covid, space is at a premium. Bodies were being burnt even in the open area outside the designated sheds at the three ghats. “You come by 4 pm there will be hardly any space to stand. The bodies brought in the day are of deaths that have taken place yesterday. Hospitals release the bodies by afternoon, this increases the rush in the later hours,” said a guard at Ambazari ghat. Sometimes, hearse vans are also falling short, so bodies are also brought in mini-Star buses, the guard said. One was seen moving out right then. No dearth of firewood was reported, however. At the Mominpura Qabrastan, there seemed to be some respite. “The numbers had gone up last month. Out of 223 deaths 67 were due to Covid. The figures have not been compiled for this month but there have been no Covid deaths since couple of days,” said Nadeem Khan, a committee member.. However, at Jaripatka Qabrastan, there were concerns that space may fall short in two-three months if deaths continue at this pace. The Covid dead are buried in a designated area. In last two months, over 20 Covid bodies have been buried. Likewise, 15 were buried at the Roman Catholic cemetery across the road, said the security guard who also complained there was little space left.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ghats-stressed-little-space-at-burial-grounds/articleshow/82021861.cms||Shishir Arya

The event is called an ‘occultation’ and for India, it will be a mixed bag. At locations in western India, the occultation will begin when the sun is still above the horizon. This event can be enjoyed without any optical aid. However, a pair of binoculars or a small telescope will be useful. Director of Nehru Planetarium at Nehru Centre, Mumbai, Arvind Paranjpye, said as it happens during a solar eclipse, the event will be visible over only some regions on the earth and the time of the event will differ from place to place. Around 5.30pm on April 17, the moon will occult Mars and the planet will reappear from behind the Moon in about an hour and a half. The phenomenon is not a rare one. But, for a given location, it is not very common either. The last occultation of Mars by the Moon, visible over India in the evening, was on May 10, 2008. Paranjpye added, “First, sight the moon. Then look for Mars to its east, which is towards the side away from its illuminated side. If the sun has already set in your location, Mars will be easily visible. As you continue to watch, you will find the separation between Mars and the moon decreasing. Finally, you will see Mars going behind the moon. It will take about nine seconds for Mars to disappear completely behind the moon.” Reappearance will be a little more difficult to catch because citizens must know exactly from what point on the moon, Mars will reappear. Citizens may take the help of the moon map, he added. Some organisations will webcast this event live.

Fire officials said that wastage kept in the lobby on the fifth floor of the trauma centre building had caught fire which could be doused within a few minutes as a team of firemen deployed in the civil hospital campus was alerted immediately. No damage or injuries were reported due to the fire. For the past two days, Covid patients are being treated in the building. Meanwhile, chaos ensued outside the civil hospital campus as the authorities closed the gate towards Choudhary high school playground on Sunday. Long queues of ambulances were seen waiting to take the patients inside. Many patients had to be treated in the ambulances itself until entry was allowed. “There was a heavy rush of patients on Sunday due to which there was a waiting time around noon. But by evening we could admit almost all the patients,” said Radheshyam Trivedi, medical superintendent. He added there were only a couple of patients in ambulances who were waiting for admission in the evening. The hospital administration had created a new entry for Covid patients and their relatives towards Choudhary high school playground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/bidi-sparks-fire-scare-in-rajkot-civil-hospital/articleshow/82021084.cms||---

---||India||China changes tack, plays hardball on Gogra-Hot Springs de-escalation||NEW DELHI: The recent round of military talks between India and China saw the Chinese side switching track, taking a rigid position on de-escalation in the Gogra-Hot Springs area, in contrast to its earlier posture when it was more fixated on the Finger area near Pangong lake. The change from the more “flexible” discussions that preceded the 11th round held on April 9 indicates that the standoff in the remaining areas can stretch on, as the Indian side is also well dug in and the government is insisting that only restoration of previous ground positions will lead to any normalcy in bilateral ties. In earlier negotiations, the Chinese were more insistent on staying on in the Finger 4-8 area, seen as the most serious transgression as far as India was concerned. The Indian success in gaining the south bank heights effectively undid the PLA advantage and eventually led to a withdrawal and creation of a no-go zone for both sides. As far as Indian thinking goes, getting PLA off the ridges is an important success. The reasons for the Chinese posture are not immediately clear but could have to do with India deepening its Quad engagement despite Beijing’s admonitions and a refusal to consider any rollback of several decisions like bans on Chinese apps until status quo returns to LAC. Though never quite so spelt out, China’s repeated remarks that the borders are only a part of bilateral ties indicate a desire for some concessions before a complete pullback. Sources said larger bilateral issues and any likely linkages or quid pro quo expectations in the context of disengagement and de-escalation do not figure in talks between military commanders. Indian position has remained that normalcy in ties can’t precede Chinese troops vacating the standoff points and a larger de-escalation. The challenge, sources said, is not insignificant for the PLA either as Indian troops are and will remain closely deployed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/china-changes-tack-plays-hardball-on-gogra-hot-springs-de-escalation/articleshow/82023226.cms||---

The state is conducting an average of 2.5 lakh tests daily, one of the highest in the country, officials said. Mumbai saw 9,986 new cases on Sunday, taking the tally to 5,20,498. While the case growth seems to have steadied with an average of 9,300 detections daily, down from the high of 11,000 cases in the first week of April, deaths in the city have started to rise sharply. On Sunday, Mumbai saw 79 deaths, the highest in 284 days. The city’s cumulative toll touched 12,023 on Sunday. Principal health secretary Dr. Pradeep Vyas said four lakh new cases were detected in the state between April 4 and April 10, while there were 1,982 deaths. “The death rate is 0.5%, but it is increasing,” he said. He also said the state’s positivity rate was 26%. “On Saturday, we did 2. 6 lakh tests, including one lakh antigen tests,” he said. He added that 75% of the 20,250 ICU beds and 40% of the 67,000 oxygen beds are filled. “Beds are not available in 11-12 districts. Isolation beds have been arranged in the railway bogies at Nandurbar,” he said, underlining the criticality of the situation. On Sunday, the state detected a staggering 63,294 cases, pushing the cumulative caseload to 34,07,245. The state will be recording six lakh cases in just 12 days of April. For the fifth day in a row, Maharashtra reported over 300 deaths. On Sunday, 349 deaths were reported pushing the state’s toll to 57,987. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region that has been the state’s worst hit in the first wave touched a million positive cases. With an addition of 19,953 cases on Sunday, the MMR case total reached 10,84,174. The region has reported 21,126 deaths. Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the Covid taskforce, said that the state was rightly emphasising on testing and tracing and hence there was a surge. “Deaths in absolute numbers are high and we must try to reduce them. But, when seen in terms of case fatality rate, it is less than 0.5%,” he said. Dr Avinash Supe, a member of the Covid death audit committee, said that people under home isolation must stay vigilant. “There have been cases where people have become critical and collapsed after eight days,” he said. Aslam Shaikh, guardian minister of Mumbai (city) said while more than 85% patients are asymptomatic, most of them are from middle and upper-middle-class, and may be occupying beds. Shaikh said the BMC has instructed its hospitals that patients with serious conditions should be given priority while allocating beds. On Sunday, 34,008 patients got discharged from various hospitals in the state taking the total to 27,82,161. The recovery rate in the state is 81.6%. Of the total new cases recorded on Sunday, almost one-third —-19,953 cases—are from MMR, while 14,653 are from Pune circle and 10,134 from Nagpur circle.

With an addition of 19,953 cases on Sunday, the MMR case total reached 10,84,174. The region has reported 21,126 deaths. Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the Covid taskforce, said that the state was rightly emphasising on testing and tracing and hence there was a surge. “Deaths in absolute numbers are high and we must try to reduce them. But, when seen in terms of case fatality rate, it is less than 0.5%,” he said. Dr Avinash Supe, a member of the Covid death audit committee, said that people under home isolation must stay vigilant. “There have been cases where people have become critical and collapsed after eight days,” he said. Aslam Shaikh, guardian minister of Mumbai (city) said while more than 85% patients are asymptomatic, most of them are from middle and upper-middle-class, and may be occupying beds. Shaikh said the BMC has instructed its hospitals that patients with serious conditions should be given priority while allocating beds. On Sunday, 34,008 patients got discharged from various hospitals in the state taking the total to 27,82,161. The recovery rate in the state is 81.6%. Of the total new cases recorded on Sunday, almost one-third —-19,953 cases—are from MMR, while 14,653 are from Pune circle and 10,134 from Nagpur circle. New cases are found not only in cities like Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, but also Beed (1090), Latur (1116), Wardha (382), Chandrapur districts (455) Gadchiroli (161).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtras-highest-single-day-case-spike-at-63k-jump-in-city-deaths/articleshow/82022630.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Rajasthan is a close second with nearly 96 lakh doses. The state’s target population is an estimated three crore, which means 5 crore doses are yet to be given (two per person). It took the state a little less than 70 days to administer one crore doses, officials said.Calling it a big achievement amid a roaring pandemic, Maharashtra’s principal health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas said that around 86.3% of healthcare workers and 72.7% frontline workers have received at least the first dose of the vaccine. “About 19.7% population in the 45-plus age category has been covered so far,” he added. As of Sunday noon, Maharashtra had administered 1,00,38,421 doses, including over 71lakh to those above 45 years, 15.52lakh health workers and 12.50lakh frontline workers. Of the one crore doses, 89.7lakh have been given the first dose and 9.5lakh both the doses, prompting experts to say that Maharashtra’s per lakh population coverage was lower than other states such as Rajasthan. The vaccination coverage that had hit a lull last week due to shortage of doses is likely to pick up from Monday. Dr Vyas said the state had about nine lakh doses on Sunday morning. “We are likely to get 14 lakh doses by Monday,” he said. From merely 18,338 vaccinations on the first day of the national drive on January 16, daily vaccinations soared to 4.6lakh on April 3. However, the momentum was badly hit last week by the vaccine shortage that pulled down daily coverage to 2.8lakh on Saturday and 2.7lakh on Friday. A state official said Maharashtra needs a steady supply of 40lakh doses every week to sustain the pace and augment daily vaccinations to six lakh. In Mumbai, civic officials said 62 of the 71 private vaccination centres will start vaccination on Monday. Vaccination at all private centres got stalled on Friday due to shortage of doses. “In the last two days, a total of 2.3lakh vaccines have been given to Mumbai. Mumbai received around 99,000 doses on Friday and 1,34,970 doses on Saturday,” the BMC said in a release. “We now have stocks to run the vaccination drive for at least five days,” said Dr Sheela Jagtap, in-charge of immunisation, BMC. All the public vaccination centres will work as per their routine hours, the BMC said. In Mumbai, vaccinations had dropped from an average of 40,000-50,000 to 33,000 due to the stockout. On Sunday too, only 33,256 doses could be administered in the municipal and state centres. Of the total vaccinated, 24,237 were those above 45 years, 7,290 senior citizens, 1,149 frontline workers and 580 healthcare workers. With 16.7lakh doses administered, Mumbai has vaccinated the highest in the state. At a meeting with state taskforce members and top state officials on Sunday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray once again stressed on vaccination. “We will speed up and vaccinate as many people as possible. This could be useful to prevent the third wave in the near future,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maha-becomes-1st-state-to-give-1cr-vax-shots-5cr-to-go/articleshow/82022590.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Its limited supply and spiralling demand are also causing problems at the city hospitals. “Short or delayed supply of Remdesivir is leading to problems in treatment of Covid positive patients,” said Dr Sanjeev Kumar, nodal officer of the Covid ward at All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna. Dr Satish Kumar, deputy superintendent of Nalanda Medical College and Hospital, said Remdesivir is used only in certain cases like severe problems in breathing. “Its limited supply and spiralling demand often lead to its shortage,” he said. Assistant drug controller, Patna, Bishwajeet Das Gupta also admitted the shortage of this injection. “Its demand in March had reached zero. The drug dealers had stopped stocking Remdesivir, fearing expiry. However, the demand for the drug has suddenly increased following rise in Covid cases,” he added. Gupta, however, said the drug department and dealers were trying their best to ensure uninterrupted supply of Remdesivir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/remdesivir-missing-from-hospitals-in-patna-as-covid-cases-surge/articleshow/82016606.cms||VK Tripathi

The two were on duty at two different police check-posts in the district. Police have so far failed to nab the assailants. The borders of the district have been barricaded to prevent the criminals from escaping. According to police, in the first incident, assailants in an SUV, two cars and a pick-up jeep, who were speeding, started firing at a patrol party at 11pm when the cops tried to stop them for checking. “The police team at Sricharbhuja Temple under Kotadi police station attempted to stop them. The passengers in these vehicles started intermittent firing,” said a senior police officer of Bhilwara district. “In the firing, one constable Onkar Raika (25) was injured. He was rushed to the hospital where he succumbed to the injuries. He had taken bullets on his chest and other parts,” the officer said. Soon after the incident, police initiated barricading and alerted every police station in the area. However, almost 30 minutes later, unknown assailants again opened fire almost 40km away from the previous spot at Raila area of Bhilwara, injuring and killing another constable. “The constable, identified as Pawan Chaudhary (27), sustained bullet injuries and fell unconscious. Our team rushed him to the hospital where he was declared brought dead,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2-constables-killed-by-drugsmugglers-in-bhilwara-dist/articleshow/82021873.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Desert Grizzled butterfly found in Jaisalmer after 67 yrs||Jaisalmer: A study has been conducted on Desert Grizzled Skipper butterfly, which was found after 67 years in Jaisalmer district. The study was done by SBK College assistant professor Shyam Sunder Meena, which covered the research on its lifestyle and other habitants. SBK Government College Jaisalmer, zoology assistant professor Shyam Sunder Meena said the Thar desert in Rajasthan is rich in biodiversity and full of mysterious animals. Sighting of the rare Desert Grizzled Skipper butterfly in Jaisalmer after almost 70 years is one of them. A research note, “Rediscovery of the rare Desert Grizzled Skipper Spialia Doris Evanida Butler, 1880 (Hesperiidae: Pyrginae) from the Thar Desert, Rajasthan, India” has been published in recent issue of the Journal of Threatened Taxa on March 26. Professor Meena said, “There are so many reasons behind the rarity of this beautiful creature of Thar. Due to the increase in human population in the area, human interference with natural resources or exploitation of natural resources leads to destruction of their habitat.” Meena said due to the loss of habitat, animal populations decrease simultaneously. Loss of habitat increases intra and inter-specific competition, by which the rate of survival decreases. He said, “In last few years’ study, I found that this butterfly feeds on the flowers of some specific wild plants, which are found only in the rocky areas of the desert. It’s also observed that these rocky areas are being modified into cultivated land or being used as stone mines. These human activities continuously decrease the habitat area of rare species of Thar.” He said, “Butterflies always lay their eggs on those plants on which their larvae feed and develop in young ones and the Desert Grizzled Skipper lays its eggs on some wild creeper shrubs of rocky Thar of Jaisalmer. These shrubs are the main food source for goats, sheep, cows and insects of the area, and due to this, the host plant was not available for a long time as a food for its larvae.” He said, “It is also recorded that most of the butterflies in the area take three to four weeks for completing their life cycle while the Desert Grizzled Skipper takes more than three months to complete its life cycle. Most of the butterflies of the area complete their life cycle mostly from June to October, while the Desert Grizzled Skipper completes its life cycle from November to February.” Professor Meena also added, “As we know the temperatures fall very close to 0 degree Celsius or lower here in winter and at this low temperature, many creatures of the area become inactive or die. It is also a reason for the low rate of survival of larvae of Grizzled Skipper. These are some reasons which make it rare.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/desert-grizzled-butterfly-found-in-jaisalmer-after-67-yrs/articleshow/82021876.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Pressure up as govt delays decision on board exams||PUNE: The state education department’s delay in announcing a decision on the secondary school certificate (SSC, Std X) and higher secondary certificate (HSC, Std XII) exams has left students in a state of confusion over the uncertainty. The board exams have been scheduled from April 23, but given the spike in Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, the education department’s decision to postpone the exams is awaited. Students have been seeking some clarity on the examination from the education department. Ruta Joshi, a student who will be appearing for SSC board, said, “We are aware that the state government is tackling a very critical situation with the rise in cases in Maharashtra. However, it should not be a difficult job to make announcements regarding our exams. The education minister or the higher authorities are sending very indecisive statements leaving all of us in a state of confusion.” Surhud Kate, an HSC student from the city, said, “The government should have had Plan B ready. They look unprepared and now when students are raising questions and looking to hear from the government they are delaying the matter leaving us all confused and puzzled.” Aniket Rao, another HSC student, said, “Our entire syllabus was covered online. So, it was a very difficult year for us to study on our own. Now that we are ready to give the exams, there is a massive spike in cases. The government is delaying its decision too. We are not able to concentrate on our studies. All our attention is on what the government has to announce regarding examinations.” School education minister Varsha Gaikwad said, “In light of recent upsurge of Covid-19 cases, I’ve been holding consultations with student representatives, elected representatives from all parties, tech giants, parents, teachers and other sector experts regarding alternatives for assessment of HSC & SSC board students.” She added that students and their parents should be assured that their safety was the government’s foremost priority. “ We are reviewing the situation and a decision will be taken soon,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pressure-up-as-govt-delays-decision-on-board-exams/articleshow/82021094.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Noida||Two sisters die as fire burns down 500 shanties in Noida||NOIDA: Two sisters, aged three and six years, were charred to death in a fire that reduced over 500 shanties to ashes in Behlolpur village near Noida Sector 65 on Sunday. Officials in the fire department said a short circuit could have caused the flames and a heavy wind fanned them. What may have caused the fire to spread fast was that most of the shanties were made of plastic and tarpaulin sheets and many of them housed godowns of inflammable materials. The villagers said they had also heard a few cooking gas cylinders exploding. Police have identified the two sisters as Paro (3) and Doll (6), whose father Shravan is a rag-picker in the area. The family is originally from Nawada in Bihar. Shravan lived with his wife and eight daughters in one of the shanties in Behlolpur. On Thursday, he had gone to Bihar to attend a wedding. Sources said Sulekha and her daughters were sleeping in the hut when the fire broke out around 1pm. Neighbours knocked on the door to inform Sulekha about the fire and when she woke up, her house was surrounded by leaping flames. She somehow managed to run out with her six daughters, but Paro and Doll could not be saved. Meera Devi, her neighbour, said most of the people were inside their shanties in the afternoon heat and were not aware of the massive fire that had started to spread by then. “It was my children who informed me in time. I rushed out of the hut along with my children and other valuables before it was reduced to ashes in front of my eyes,” she said. “Sulekha had tried to save all her children. But she couldn’t save Paro and Doll,” she added. Naresh Paswan, a villager, said he had seen a small fire break out in the garbage dump. “Within seconds, the flames had started to spread to the row of shanties. The fire was spreading so fast that we couldn’t do anything but stand mute spectators. Cooking gas cylinders had started to explode. Many of the people were running out of their huts to escape the flames, leaving all their valuables behind,” he added. Chief fire officer Arun Kumar Singh said his team was informed about the fire around 2pm. A total of 17 fire tenders fought the flames for two hours to bring them under control. “We have formed a team to investigate the exact cause of the fire,” he added. Villagers said the damage would have been much less had the fire fighters and police responded in time. They alleged they had to make at least 20 calls to the nearest police station. A police team, the villagers claimed, arrived with the fire department personnel around 3pm, two hours after the flames had started to spread. DCP (central Noida) Harish Chander said the fire tenders and a police team reached the spot within 10 minutes of getting the first call. “There was a heavy wind, which fanned the flames. Since most of the shanties were made of plastic and tarpaulin sheets, the fire spread very fast. Still, we managed to save at least 20 shanties,” he added. Noida district magistrate Suhas LY announced an Rs 8 lakh compensation for the family of the two sisters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/2-sisters-die-as-fire-burns-down-500-shanties-in-noida/articleshow/82021878.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey

---||Pune||Pune: Farm produce likely to flood Market Yard today||PUNE: The Market Yard in Gultekdi, which is the biggest wholesale market in the city, is expected to get excess intake of vegetables and fruits due to closure of the market for the last two days due to the weekend lockdown imposed by the state government. Datta Bibve, head of onion and potato section, said, “We expect to get more number of vehicles on Monday. Usually, the market gets around 1,000 vehicles of agriculture produce. Now, it is expected to increase to 1,300- 1,400 vehicles.” Farmers are desperate to sell their produce due to the current situation and hence they would bring produce in large quantity, officials from the market said. “We can't predict the rates scenario as we can't rule out the possibility of panic buying on Monday,” he added. The similar situation is expected to prevail in other wholesale markets across the district, said the officials. Vegetable markets in Kolhapur city are expected to be flooded with supply on Monday as the harvested vegetables have been piling up in the backyards of the farmers due to the weekend lockdown. The farmers will bring their produce to the city’s mandis on Monday. Despite allowing vegetable and fruit vendors to operate, most markets and roadside vegetable vendors decided to observe the lockdown. The citizens, abiding by the law, too stayed indoors. As per the government orders, farming operations were allowed to continue. The farmers had expected the mandis to remain open. They had thought that citizens would be coming to buy vegetables. Eknath Pawar, a vegetable grower in Shirol, said, “I went to Kolhapur to sell vegetables expecting the mandis to be open. However, most of the markets were shut. Moreover I was not allowed to sell my produce in the residential areas as police and locals said that there will be crowding if I set up shop on the society premises. I am heading to Shirol on Monday. Once the markets open on Monday, many farmers will flock to the mandis to sell their produce and the prices will crash. The lockdown has proven to be a bane for small-time farmers.” Similarly, while construction activities were allowed, the shops selling construction goods and equipment were shut. Ravikant Patil, a contractor in Morewadi, said, “The workers are sitting idle at the site since the last two days. The shops are closed and we need the material to resume construction.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/farm-produce-likely-to-flood-market-yard-today/articleshow/82021099.cms||Sandip Dighe

On Sunday, the prevention of crime branch (PCB) busted a racket of illegal sale of this drug and detained two persons including a doctor. Following a tip-off, the sleuths set a trap and caught hold of the duo who were taking advantage of the shortage of remdesivir in the city. “I had received information that someone is selling the drug for a higher price in open market. We sent a cop as a decoy customer to buy the drug. One the accused, Dr Dhiren Nagora turned up at Raopura crossroads and offered to sell the drug,” said J J Patel, PCB police inspector. Nagora, an ayurvedic doctor, demanded Rs 7,500 for the injection and the cops immediately detained him. “We found one remdesivir injection from his car. On questioning, he admitted having one more accomplice Rahul Valand, who works as a nurse in a hospital,” Patel told TOI. Cops then set another trap for Valand who offered to sell one remdesivir injection for Rs 9,000, almost 10 times the actual price.  Both Nagora and Valand knew each other as they had worked together in a private hospital. They got together and began selling these injections in open market for a higher price. When asked how they managed to source the drug which has become extremely scarce, Patel said, Police also suspect that they used to tamper the prescription given by the doctor to the patient and get more remdesivir injections that were then sold for a higher price. The cops have also picked up one more person identified as Krunal who works as a nurse in a private hospital. “Krunal was also in touch with Valand and Nagora. It is an elaborate racket of selling the drug in black market as those in need are ready to pay any amount,” Patel added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/remdesivir-black-marketing-racket-busted/articleshow/82019563.cms||---

---||Pune||Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray meets task force, no agreement on lockdown||MUMBAI: In a meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, members of the state task force are believed to have expressed mixed feelings about a complete lockdown and how far it would help to curb the pandemic at this stage. In a bid to take a stock of the financial burden and to consider providing some relief to daily wagers and labourers and the underprivileged, Thackeray will have a meeting with the finance minister and senior officials in the next two days before announcing a decision on a complete lockdown. During Sunday’s meetings, most of the members of the state Covid task force expressed the need to impose tight curbs to ‘break the chain’ of coronavirus. However, TOI has learnt that the task force members were divided on the idea of a complete lockdown with several saying it may not do much to curb the raging pandemic at this stage. One of the suggestions made by the members was to lock down districts where health infrastructure is on the brink of collapse. Another suggestion was to bring in hefty penalties for those violating Covid norms. The discussion also veered towards how much the state could do to augment health infrastructure with the time bought with a lockdown. The CM had a discussion on whether a lockdown should be for eight or 15 days. A senior official said it has already been decided to impose a complete lockdown and instructions have been given to the state administration to draft the SOPs to ensure that health services are not impacted. The date of implementation is yet to be decided but is likely to be in the next 2-3 days, said an official. A task force member said: “Scientifically, lockdowns have helped in the first instance. It may also work to some extent in the second instance, but a lot depends on what we want to do after and during the lockdown to build infrastructure”. Another member said: “A complete lockdown would be pointless at this stage. For 10% who are violating norms, why should the entire 90% suffer? We have to find a way to penalise the 10%”. There was speculation that after meeting the task force, the CM may announce a total lockdown on Sunday, in continuation with the weekend lockdown. The decision has now been deferred. As of now, lockdown-like restrictions will continue from Monday morning, which will allow only shops selling essentials to remain open.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cm-meets-task-force-no-agreement-on-lockdown/articleshow/82023326.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

Data shows that there has been a 300% jump in loans through Nabard’s rural infrastructure development fund (RIDF) scheme as the state looks for different sources to fund infrastructure works. While Nabard announced in October last year that it had lent Rs 85 crore to the state government under the RIDF scheme, the amount has jumped to Rs 344 crore. The jump has surprised Nabard as it exceeded their own estimates. “Achievement of sanction and disbursement under the RIDF scheme for financial year 2020-21 were Rs 344 crore and Rs 250 crore as against a target of Rs 65 crore and Rs 150 crore respectively,” said a Nabard official. The state government has utilised RIDF fund to support the expansion of the solid waste treatment plant at Saligao where Hindustan Waste Treatment Pvt Ltd will bear 25% of the cost while the remaining funds are coming from Nabard. In the previous year, the RIDF funds were used to build and supply bio-digester toilets to people as part of the campaign to rid the state of open defecation. The state government has also relied on the Nabard Infrastructure Development Assistance (NIDA) scheme with Rs 64.9 crore sanctioned and Rs 21.9 crore disbursed. Cumulative borrowings through Nabard were Rs 451 crore in 2014 and are projected to touch Rs 980 crore in 2022. Nabard officials also said that funding under long term irrigation fund, and the fisheries and aquaculture infrastructure development fund are in the final stages of sanction. An amount of Rs 3.8 crore has been released as central government grant assistance for Tillari irrigation project in the previous financial year. Nabard, which recently held its state credit seminar, also said that efforts are being made to support geographical tagging of local produce such as Kunbi weaving, Mankurad mango and Bebinca.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goas-dependence-on-nabard-for-funding-of-infra-projects-picking-up/articleshow/82021971.cms||---

Mehboob Shaikh (45) is the manager of the Nashik Municipal Corporation-run crematorium for a decade. The flow of bodies at Amardham crematorium, located on the banks of river Godavari, has risen over the past few days. Shaikh has been working tirelessly to help bereaved families complete the final rites. “I have no hesitation in working at a crematorium meant for Hindus. I feel that it’s a pious job to help the dead in their final journey,” said Shaikh. He has to maintain cleanliness on the premises, ensure all basic amenities are in place and the proper functioning of the two electric and one gas crematoriums. He also has to see that there is enough wood for the 14 traditional pyres. He also completes the paperwork before bodies are cremated. “There are many cases when bereaved families leave bodies without performing last rites as they fear getting Covid. We then perform the last rites,” Shaikh told TOI. Although Nashik city has six crematoriums, the rush at Amardham is always greater. This crematorium handles over 15-20 bodies a day. “The pain of families losing their loved ones is much more than our workload,” says Shaikh. Sunil Sirsath, sanitary inspector of East Nashik division, is all praise for Shaikh. “He has set an example for all of us. Despite hailing from a different community, he works at the Hindu crematorium. He’s been working well to manage it,” added Sirsath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/maharashtra-muslim-manages-crematorium-wins-hearts-in-covid-time/articleshow/82021976.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

When the wife of the man admitted in the PMCH Covid ward reportedly bribed someone at the Bansghat crematorium in the city to have his last glimpse, as no one is allowed to unwrap the body of a Covid patient before cremation, she found to her utter surprise that he was not her hubby but someone else. She immediately went back to the PMCH and found her husband alive! When it was brought to the notice of PMCH administration, its superintendent Dr IS Thakur terminated health manager Anjali Kumari from service on the charge of handing over the body of a Covid deceased to the family of another patient admitted there and still undergoing treatment. “It was a serious matter showing gross negligence on the part of the health manager. She was terminated with immediate effect,” Dr Thakur said. An inquiry would also follow so as to ascertain whether other officials, doctors and staff were accountable for the incident, he said. The body was brought back from Bansghat to PMCH. Thakur said one Raj Kumar Bhagat from Purnia died of Covid 19 on Sunday morning. His body was wrapped as per the Covid protocols and mistakenly handed over to the family members of another patient from Barh, who is still undergoing treatment there. Taking the incident as a serious lapse, Patna DM Dr Chandrasekhar Singh asked the PMCH superintendent and principal to fix accountability on the guilty persons within 24 hours and take stern action against them. He also directed the PMCH authorities to ensure that there was no repetition of such incidents in future. Dr Thakur said when the Barh man’s wife came back to the PMCH and reported the matter, the gross negligence of the health manager was confirmed as she was primarily responsible for completing the formalities after a Covid patient’s death. “The Barh man was admitted with some serious health issues. He was tested positive for the virus on Friday and admitted to the Covid ward where he is still undergoing treatment,” Dr Thakur said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pmch-declares-alive-covid-patient-dead/articleshow/82020381.cms||VK Tripathi

Cumulatively, the cities accounted for 47% of the daily cases. “The scenario is getting grim by the day – every new case requires medical attention either at home or hospital. Every hospitalization thus requires medication, oxygen, injections and hospital bed, which is fast running out. Now Ahmedabad city has over 5,300 beds but out of total 40 ventilators and 70 ICU beds were available. In all, the occupancy was over 80%,” said a senior medical official from Ahmedabad.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Boosting oxygen supply is challenge, says Task force chief||Mumbai: Critical measures will have to be taken for tackling the further spread of coronavirus, state-level Covid task force chairman Sanjay Oke said on Sunday. A comprehensive action plan should be drafted with the assumption that the pandemic will continue to affect people till the end of 2021 or even beyond, he added. “During the marathon meeting with CM Uddhav Thackeray, the task force has given its opinion on enforcing the lockdown. Now, it is for the CM to take a decision; he may consult his cabinet colleagues,” Oke told TOI. “In my opinion, if we have to tackle coronavirus, we will have to ensure adequate supply of oxygen, judicious use of remdesivir and augmentation of beds.” Oke said there appears to be acute shortage of oxygen and the government will have to take immediate measures for manufacturing oxygen within the state. “We will have to work out an action plan; we should not be dependent on other states,” he said. Oke further said that it was time for “judicious use” of remdesivir and efforts should also be made to augment beds across the state on top priority. “We should carefully prescribe remdesivir, otherwise, its excessive use may prove to be counterproductive,” he said. “Also, the administration must ensure that adequate number of beds are available. We will have to rope in the private sector for the purpose.” —Prafulla Marpakwar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-boosting-oxygen-supply-is-challenge-says-task-force-chief/articleshow/82022792.cms||---

Hospitals will use their discretion of administering it to the patients," he added. "Given the present scale of the pandemic, the government is taking all steps to address the issues related to scarcity of medicines, beds, oxygen supply etc," he said.Rupani appealed to people to purchase remdesivir only as per doctor's advice so that scarcity does not emerge. "It's not necessary that if you have corona, you need to take remdesivir," he said.He said the government has facilitated the supply of 50,000 remdesivir injections to Ahmedabad and 25,0000 each to Rajkot, Surat and VadodaraDecision on lockdown as per GOI guidelinesPalanpur: Asked if the state government is mulling a mini-lockdown for 4-5 days, chief minister Vijay Rupani said that they are constantly in touch with the government of India and any decision will be taken as per the guidance of the Centre.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Desperate remdesivir run, despair for hundreds||AHMEDABAD: Sameer Patel, a resident of Anand, had driven from the milk town to Ahmedabad on Sunday morning on his bike. “My cousin is in hospital and none from his family could arrange for remdesivir. Thus, I decided to help them and stand in queue,” said the youth. “But despite waiting here for over three hours, all I could get was a token number, which might or might not work on Monday.” He then prepared for the return journey in the scorching heat of Sunday afternoon. Hundreds braved the heat and serpentine queues on Sunday, hoping to get the drug from Zydus Hospital. However, only 700-odd of the over 2,000 who had gathered outside the hospital could get remdesivir injections, according to sources. The hospital authorities could not be contacted despite several attempts. The hospital had announced that the distribution will take place from 8.30am to 5.30pm. But by 11am, the stock was already exhausted and the city police were called to control the crowd. However, people continued to visit the hospital, inquiring about the arrival of fresh supply even as the authorities put up a board saying ‘out of stock.’ Several relatives also raised concerns about the crowding sans social distancing and mask protocols. The struggle for remdesivir played out in the city when CM Vijay Rupani in Patan claimed that 2.8 lakh injections of the antiviral drug had been distributed over the past 10 days. He also said that the order for 3 lakh more injections had been placed. Of the total, 50,000 injections will be provided to Ahmedabad whereas three other major cities will get 25,000 each. On Saturday, the Drugs Controller General of India wrote to Food and Drugs Control Administration commissioners of various states including Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and Maharashtra. The letter was about the shortage of remdesivir and instructed ‘immediate remedial action to ensure supply of remdesivir injections to public and private hospitals.’ “I was in the queue at the hospital on Saturday and the stock ran out. I came back again,” said Gaurang Patel, a resident of Ghatlodia. “I will have to come back on Monday if I want to help my family procure six injections which have remained elusive for the past three days.” Patel added: “It’s a matter of life and death for the patients. Why can’t there be a better system of distribution and procurement?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/desperate-remdesivir-run-despair-for-hundreds/articleshow/82021188.cms||---

The Kishanganj police team had raided the village to arrest the accused of a bike loot case. Both Kumar and his mother were cremated together on the outskirts of their village Panchu Mandal Tola under Jankinagar police station area of Banmankhi in Purnia district. Kumar’s mother was suffering from several age-related ailments. His father had died around seven years ago, Kumar’s maternal uncle Subhash Singh told TOI over phone. “Kumar’s mother died of heart attack around 5.30am on Sunday. Initially, she was not told about the incident, but her condition started deteriorating after Kumar’s body reached home around 5pm on Saturday,” Subhash said. Purnia divisional commissioner Rahul Ranjan Mahiwal, IG (Purnia range) Suresh Prasad Choudhary, DM Rahul Kumar, SP Daya Shankar, Kishnganj SDPO Anwar Jawed and several other civil and police officers were present during the cremation.

That is the conclusion of a recent analysis of wastewater of Ahmedabad, Vadodara, and Gandhinagar carried out by the researchers from IIT-Gn and Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC). The paper, ‘Comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in wastewater from three different cities of Gujarat, India’, was authored by Vaibhav Srivastava, Shilangi Gupta, Arbind Kumar Patel, and Manish Kumar of IIT-Gn. From GBRC, Madhvi Joshi was the author. The paper was recently uploaded on MedRxiv for peer review. The paper said that Ahmedabad, which has the highest number of Covid-19 cases in Gujarat, had the second largest RNA copies at 2,968 per 1 lakh litre of wastewater based on the analysis of nine wastewater plants. Vadodara had the highest concentration at 3,078. Gandhinagar had 354 RNA copies per 1 lakh litre of water, added the study. The study included three genes — N, ORF1ab and S — for analysis. S and ORF were the highest in Vadodara whereas the N gene was more prominent in Ahmedabad. The samples were collected in the first week of November 2020. .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/wastewater-can-help-discern-viral-spread/articleshow/82021181.cms||Parth Shastri

The university has decided to give the option to students of all affiliated colleges of taking the exams in online mode as well. Recently, the university had announced its decision to put the exams on hold amid a surge in Covid-19 cases in Gujarat. “Except for law students, we will give the option to all other students for giving the exams in online mode. The number of Covid-19 cases are on a rise and there is lot of uncertainty about when the scenario will improve. We are aiming to complete the exams on time so that the next academic session can begin from June,” said Himanshu Pandya, vice-chancellor of GU. The varsity had earlier announced to hold the exams from April 12. The exams were to be held in pen and paper or offline format. In March, the varsity had initiated examination process but after completion of the first exam paper for semester I candidates, it decided to defer them after the state government announced closure of all colleges till April 10. The government has now decided to extend the closure of all varsities and colleges till the end of April. The university will announce dates for online exams once the students register themselves for online and offline formats.

---||Delhi||Hyacinth beds raise dengue-malaria spectre in Delhi||NEW DELHI: The city is currently braving the double whammy of a surge in Covid-19 cases along with a 6-7 times higher density of mosquitoes. This has created anxiety among residents regarding the spread of vector-borne diseases. The problem is especially worrisome in areas along the Yamuna as water hyacinth has not been removed for the past two years. A senior official from South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) said a dense water hyacinth bed along Kalindi Kunj and Okhla stretching for 2-3 kilometres has become a mosquito-breeding hotspot. Despite the matter being raised repeatedly with other departments, no action has been taken yet. An intersectoral meeting with officials of Delhi Development Authority, irrigation department, Delhi Jal Board and other agencies was called last week to discuss the issue of unusually high mosquito density and their underlying reasons. “During the meeting, the SDMC commissioner discussed the serious concern with the irrigation department since hyacinth in the Yamuna near Okhla Barrage is severely affecting the colonies along this belt,” said the official. The areas being severely impacted include Kalindi Kunj, Sarita Vihar, Jasola Vihar, Madanpur Khadar, Jamia Millia Islamia and Abul Fazal Enclave. A senior public health official said, “Flooding of basements, close proximity to the Yamuna and storage of water in jerrycans due to a poor supply network makes some of these areas potential hotspots for dengue and malaria.” Last year, the first malaria death in the city after a gap of more than five years was reported from one of these areas. “The barrage is under the UP irrigation department, which should clean the pondage area regularly. However, they haven’t been able to procure the machines to weed out water hyacinth in the last two years,” added the official. Another official said the dense bed of water hyacinth prohibits larvicide sprays from reaching below the surface. During monsoon, the leaves of these floating plants accumulated water, which leads to breeding of dengue-causing aedes mosquitoes. A survey conducted by SDMC to assess mosquito density in south Delhi detected levels over six times higher than normal around this time of the year. The west zone reported the highest density at 7.2 units (man per hour), followed by central zone (6.6 units) and south zone (5.8 units), while Najafgarh reported the least at 4.8 units. However, an official said only culex mosquitoes were detected and not the dengue-malaria causing anopheles and aedes genus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hyacinth-beds-raise-dengue-malaria-spectre/articleshow/82021979.cms||Paras Singh
---||Delhi||HC: Admission prospectus terms binding on all parties||New Delhi: The terms and conditions of prospectus for admission bind the parties, Delhi High Court said, while rejecting the claim of certain students to pursue higher courses at AIIMS for the academic year 2020-21. The court dismissed several pleas of students who have sought admission in MSc and PhD courses of AIIMS, but did not clear the qualifying examination (graduation and postgraduation) conducted by the respective universities. The students had argued that they appeared in the entrance examination, and after declaration of the result, found themselves on the merit list that would have entitled them to admission. However, they could not secure a seat as they did not clear the qualifying examination within the stipulated date. The students had sought extension of the date for the qualifying examination in the wake of the pandemic. A bench of justices Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Amit Bansal said, “There is no reason why the appellants (students) alone should be given the benefit of Covid-19 and not the others, who may be entitled to it.” “There has to be a finality to admissions. The appellants participated in the admission process in terms of the prospectus published. As per the terms and conditions of such admission process, the appellants are not eligible for admission,” the bench said. It added that according to the rules, others, though placed lower on the merit in the result of the entrance examination, were eligible for and entitled to admission, and they could be displaced. The court’s verdict came on a batch of appeals by medical students challenging their rejection. Advocate Dushyant Parashar, representing AIIMS in one of the appeals, submitted that though a large part of the first year of the two-year course was already over, the academic council of AIIMS had now instructed him to make a statement before the court, that if the status quo is lifted, the curriculum would be completed before the end of the academic year, by making up for the lost time by holding classes on all holidays. According to the AIIMS admission prospectus, even those who till the stipulated date may not have cleared the qualifying examination, but were likely to clear it within the stipulated date, were permitted to apply. However, if such candidates do not clear the examination by the fixed date, they would not be admitted, the prospectus stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-admission-prospectus-terms-binding-on-all-parties/articleshow/82021395.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: State asks Centre to ease Ct value used to measure Covid||Pune: A laboratory marker to identify viral loads in Covid swab samples has divided opinion over its utility and use. Ct (or, cycle threshold value) indicates the number of cycles completed to identify the virus in a sample during an RT-PCR test. The Ct value is inversely proportional to the viral load in the sample — lower the value, higher the viral presence.Last week, the state wrote to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), asking if Ct value cut-off can be at 24 — meaning a sample testing over 24 can be described as negative. The ICMR said it cannot be lower than 35.Globally, the accepted cut-off for Ct value for Covid-19 ranges from 35 to 40, depending upon instructions laid down by individual manufacturers. In the USA, the CDC recommends Ct value of less than 35 for nCoV.Dr Balram Bhargava, director general of ICMR, in a letter to state health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas, said a Ct value of less than 35 should be considered as a Covid-19 positive case, based on a consensus derived from different laboratories in the country. Dr Bhargava wrote that implementing a Ct value cut-off of 24 would lead to “missing of several infectious patients and increased disease transmission”.Health minister Rajesh Tope told TOI that it has now been decided that those with a Ct value over 35 would be declared ‘Covid-negative’.Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state Covid-19 taskforce, said there should not be over-reliance on the Ct value while treating patients. “Rapid antigen tests come back negative for CT value between 24 and 35. We need to do more and more RT-PCR tests. When there is a large population of asymptomatic patients involved, the question is whether they can be spreaders or not... Lowering the threshold will reduce the so-called ‘case-demic’...The idea is to get the right population,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-asks-centre-to-ease-ct-value-used-to-measure-covid/articleshow/82022797.cms||---
---||Amritsar||SKM rejects Narendra Singh Tomar’s request to postpone protest due to Covid||BATHINDA: Sanyukta Kisan Morcha has rejected the appeal of Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar asking farmers to vacate the protest sites. The morcha on Sunday termed the statement not a suggestion “but a condition for resuming talks”. Amid a spike in Covid-19 cases, Tomar on Saturday had appealed to the farmers protesting at Delhi borders to call off their long-running agitation, saying the government was ready for a discussion whenever they came with a concrete proposal. SKM alleged, “Tomar has asked farmers to postpone the protest which is not a suggestion but a condition that talks can take place after vacating the protest sites. Farmers have never refused to talk to the government. The government should send a proposal for talks, the farmer leaders are ready for talks.” In the meanwhile, Sarvjatiya Sarvakhap panchayat was organised at protest site of Antil Khap at Singhu border on Sunday. In the panchayat, led by Hawa Singh, SKM’s Rakesh Tikait, Darshan Pal and Yogendra Yadav too remained present. It was decided that the visit of chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar in the Rai assembly’s Badoli village on Wednesday will be strongly and peacefully opposed. The panchayat said it was not opposing the unveiling of B R Ambedkar’s statue and “farmers had no objection if anyone other than the chief minister” unveiled this statue. SKM supported the decision and announced that the protest in Haryana on Wednesday would be confined to the programmes of chief minister Khattar and deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala at Kaithal. The programme at other places in Haryana would be disturbed. Tikait alleged that the CM had “sinister design behind his plan to unveil Ambedkar statue” at village Badoli. He (Khattar) wanted farmer and ‘Bahujan Samaj’ to be at loggerheads but we talked to them, he claimed. SKM warned the central government that if their demands were not met then more actions like blocking of KMP-KGP expressways would be taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/skm-rejects-tomars-request-to-postpone-protest-due-to-covid/articleshow/82021198.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Goa||AAP invokes Parrikar’s legacy, says will fulfil his vision for Goa||PANAJI: Aam Aadmi Party on Sunday made a clear attempt to usurp Manohar Parrikar’s legacy when Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia called upon those disgruntled BJP karyakartas to join AAP and take forward the late chief minister’s vision for development of Goa. Taking a dig at the current BJP dispensation for ignoring Parrikar’s ideas and his loyalists, Sisodia said the saffron party “has buried the vision of development for Goa” after his death and side-lined people who aligned with his vision. “I want to convey to BJP volunteers in Goa to leave the party as it will never be able to bring Parrikarji’s vision of development to life. Join our fleet of 4,000 AAP volunteers, who will take forward Parrikar bab’s vision for Goa,” he said. Sisodia said AAP will win the 2022 assembly elections and will bring “Parrikar bab’s vision for a developed Goa into life”. “We want to focus on Goa’s vision of sincere politics. When we focus on sincere politics and attain growth, when we focus on politics of vision, we take into account the needs of what people in Goa want, what changes need to be made for Goa’s progress,” he said. “Whoever has the vision to bring growth in Goa should join hands with AAP. We can together work towards Goa’s development. BJP will never make an impact for Goa’s progress,” Sisodia said. He accused BJP and Congress of buying MLAs and indulging in dirty politics to win elections. “If BJP and Congress accumulated money for redevelopment of Goa instead of buying MLAs, incomplete projects would have been ready by now. Look at Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal’s commitment has been to ensure that a flyover in Delhi is made within 12 months, with the least amount of money,” he told a meeting of AAP volunteers to discuss a roadmap for Goa. Sisodia said the Goa team comprises 4,000 volunteers in 40 constituencies of Goa, who are working towards a common goal of development, and wants to increase its base to at least 10,000. “It is no small feat that a new party, a party started six years ago, got a vote share of 15% in Goa. Someone like Hanzel Fernandes, a 26-year-old member of AAP who won a seat in Goa, gives us hope that there are people who are dedicated, who want to bring good change in Goa,” he said. “People see the strides that we are making for Delhi’s development, and we want to do the same in Goa,” he said. Sisodia said the party wants a Goa model to emerge which takes into account the needs of the people and which will ensure the best of education, healthcare and welfare facilities to people. He said the budget of Delhi increased from Rs 30,000 crore in 2015 to Rs 60,000 crore in five years. “Our citizens do not shy away from paying taxes, it is our governments. It is political parties like BJP and Congress which use taxes for their own gains. Today, people ask about Kejriwal’s model of governance, it is a model of using taxpayers’ money to circle back benefits to citizens,” Sisodia said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-invokes-parrikars-legacy-says-will-fulfil-his-vision-for-goa/articleshow/82021191.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Gurgaon||10pm-5am curfew in Delhi and Noida forces weddings to shift to Gurugram||GURUGRAM: The 10pm-5am curfew in Delhi, Noida and Ghaziabad and a cap on wedding guests have prompted organisers in these NCR cities to look for banquet halls and party lawns in Gurugram. Hall owners in the city said there had been a 25-30% increase in the number of enquiries from neighbouring areas where restrictions at night are in place. Many of them pointed out that since the wedding season would begin in a week and most of the auspicious occasions are late at night, it would not be possible to hold the event during the day. “The administrations in Delhi, Noida and Ghaziabad have suddenly imposed restrictions on movement at night. So, people who had been planning the weddings of their family members are now scrambling for venues in places with fewer curbs, such as Gurugram, Mussoorie and Dehradun. While some have been deferring the events indefinitely, others are planning a small daytime or evening ceremony,” a wedding planner in the city said. Anil Rao, president of the Haryana tent dealers’ association, iterated that they had been getting calls from various NCR cities. “On an average, every fourth booking now is from outside Gurugram,” he said. People said they were left with little choice but to shift the wedding venues because the auspicious occasions like lagan and pheras have to be done late at night, when the curbs would be in place. “Usually, the muhurat for pheras in Hindu weddings is around 2am or 3am. The wedding itself starts after 9pm. Since other cities have imposed curfew at night, we have had to shift our venue to Gurugram,” said Sugam Vohra, a Dwarka resident whose daughter is getting married. Tushar Dutt, a resident from Munirka Vihar in Delhi, echoed him. “We have changed the venue and rescheduled most of the events from 9pm to 6pm. We have booked an open space for 500 people because most of our guests are from Gurugram. We are also looking for a hotel for the guests as they would not be able to return at night,” he added. The administrations of Delhi, Noida and Ghaziabad had last week imposed curfew between 10pm and 5am. The Delhi government has capped the number of guests at weddings at 50. UP has ordered that no more than 100 people should gather in open areas and 50 in indoor halls. In Haryana, the government has issued guidelines that 50% of the total capacity of an indoor hall should be occupied but the number of guests should not exceed 200. For lawns and other open areas, not more than 500 people can gather at a time. Wedding organisers in Gurugram and Delhi questioned the guidelines. “The limit on 200 and 500 people is not justified for big hotels and banquet halls. The government should allow hotels to take a call on the number of guests to be allowed, depending on the size of the hall. It would have been better had the number of guests allowed was half the capacity of a banquet hall rather than a fixed number,” said Sanjeev Kumar, senior vice-president of the Haryana banquet halls association. Yogesh Garg, the owner of a banquet in Delhi’s Mahipalpur, said around 25% of his bookings have been cancelled. “We have decided to organise functions between 3pm and 8.30pm. But tell me, what good will this curfew do at night? Gatherings are bound to take place, be it day or night. How can they stop it? What if the people who attend a wedding in Gurugram come back to Delhi with Covid?” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/10pm-5am-curfew-in-delhi-noida-forces-weddings-to-shift-to-gurgaon/articleshow/82022019.cms||Shahnawaz Alam
---||Goa||Cotigao man keeps cane farmers afloat, buys produce at more than govt price||Poinguinim: While farmers in Goa were struggling after Sanjeevani, the state’s only sugarcane processing factory at Dharbandora was shut down, a farmer in remote Cotigao in Canacona, Umesh (Daya) Gaonkar has turned a saviour. He also happens to be the sarpanch of Cotigao. Gaonkar came to the rescue of sugarcane farmers by starting a jaggery production unit for which he began purchasing cane from local farmers. Being a farmer himself, Gaonkar seemed to understand the plight of other food producers as him. So he started buying the raw sugarcane produce at Rs1,000 per quintal, a price higher than the government’s support price of Rs650 per quintal. Gaonkar’s generosity does not end here. He also provides the waste generated after crushing the sugarcane, free of cost to the dairy farmers in his neighbourhood in Canacona, saving these milk production units the cost of purchasing cattle feed. Gaonkar is a resident of remote Yedda ward in Cotigao and took the courageous decision to set up the unit of producing jaggery and kaakam or liquid jaggery almost overnight. His small home-based unit now provides employment to eight locals. “To run the unit I buy the entire sugarcane produce from farmers in Cotigao and Gaondongrim, in Canacona at Rs1000 per quintal. About 20 farmers are tied up to my unit. Their harvest is about 200 tonnes,” said Gaonkar. The farmers were thrilled to learn of Gaonkar’s unit at a time when sugarcane produce in the state was standing in the fields, unharvested due to the Sanjeevani factory shutting down. The farmers are now upbeat and have decided to bring under cultivation even the area they had left fallow for some years. Meanwhile dairy farmers from the area, Manohar Velip, Vithoba Gaonkar and Gajanan Velip, who would have to bring cow-feed from Belagavi are benefiting from Gaonkar’s generosity as they can collect the sugarcane waste for free from CotiAgro Jaggery at Yedda. Gaonkar sells his jaggery in ‘Khotigao Mahila mart’ run by 25 women’s self-help groups (SHGs). “The product is being bought by buyers from Panaji, Mapusa, Dhargal, Margao, Quepem and even Karwar. This jaggery has multiple advantages as it is prepared at home using age-old methods as well as containers for storage. The liquid jaggery is particularly good for those suffering from low haemoglobin and cold. The jaggery is sold for Rs150 per kg and the liquid jaggery for Rs200 per liter,” said Gaonkar Gaonkar manufactures more than 600 kg of jaggery daily. Gaonkar began this home industry only in January this year and locals will be able to find employment here for 4-5 months upto May. “I spent about Rs5 lakh to set up this plant. So far we have had business of about Rs15 lakh,” he said. Gaonkar added that minister for tribal welfare, Govind Gaude sanctioned Rs15 lakh under the tribal cooperative marketing development federation of India limited’s (Trifed) Navnirman Vandhan Vikas Kendra - an initiative to generate livelihood for tribals through forest wealth or produce. The finished product will be sold out through Navnirman village organizations, sanctioned by NABARD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cotigao-man-keeps-cane-farmers-afloat-buys-produce-at-more-than-govt-price/articleshow/82021236.cms||Albert Fernandes

---||Noida||10pm-5am curfew in Delhi and Noida forces weddings to shift to Gurugram||GURUGRAM: The 10pm-5am curfew in Delhi, Noida and Ghaziabad and a cap on wedding guests have prompted organisers in these NCR cities to look for banquet halls and party lawns in Gurugram. Hall owners in the city said there had been a 25-30% increase in the number of enquiries from neighbouring areas where restrictions at night are in place. Many of them pointed out that since the wedding season would begin in a week and most of the auspicious occasions are late at night, it would not be possible to hold the event during the day. “The administrations in Delhi, Noida and Ghaziabad have suddenly imposed restrictions on movement at night. So, people who had been planning the weddings of their family members are now scrambling for venues in places with fewer curbs, such as Gurugram, Mussoorie and Dehradun. While some have been deferring the events indefinitely, others are planning a small daytime or evening ceremony,” a wedding planner in the city said. Anil Rao, president of the Haryana tent dealers’ association, iterated that they had been getting calls from various NCR cities. “On an average, every fourth booking now is from outside Gurugram,” he said.

---||Chandigarh||Fire at mandi in Yamunanagar||YAMUNANAGAR: As many as 4,500 gunny bags filled with wheat were damaged due to fire that broke out at a temporary purchase centre at Ranjitpur village in Yamunanagar district on Sunday afternoon, amid the ongoing procurement of wheat. HAFED district manager Surender Singh confirmed the damage, ascertained after the initial assessment. He said the exact loss is yet to be ascertained. He added that 22 untouched bales (each containing 500 bags) of jute gunny bags, four-five motorcycles and a power generator of arhtiyas (commission agents) also got damaged in the fire. “The fire has damaged 4,500 bags filled with wheat and the damage is suspected to be 5-10kg per bag. The fire has turned 22 bales of untouched jute gunny bags into ashes,” said Surender. When asked about the reason behind the fire, Surender said, “Some workers had built about 15 huts outside along the market area. It is being said that the fire first broke out in a hut, then spread in other huts, and then to the purchase centre.”The Yamunanagar district administration has set up a temporary purchase centre at Ranjitpur, following the increase in wheat arrival in the last few days and HAFED is the concerned procurement agency dealing here. The fire broke out at 3pm. On receiving information, three fire tenders rushed to the spot and struggled for some hours to douse the flames. President of the arhtiyas association at Ranjitpur purchase centre, Mohan Lal, said, “It is the loss of arhtiyas and the government should compensate for the same. Until and unless wheat is not lifted from the grain market or purchase centre, arhtiyas are held responsible for loss and damage. The government should help us financially for suffering this loss.” Yamunanagar fire officer Pramod Duggal said, “There is a fire tender in Bilaspur, but it is defective and is being repaired. The rest of the vehicles were sent from different areas of Yamunanagar district which reached Ranjitpur grain market after one to one-and-a-half hours.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/fire-at-mandi-in-yamunanagar/articleshow/82021240.cms||JK Singh
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘Bed, oxygen, staff shortages across state’||MUMBAI: Oxygen supply, lack of manpower and malfunctioning ventilators have emerged as the big issues in the fight against Covid-19 across many districts in the state, says a report from the Centre. Based on the feedback of central teams that are visiting 30 high burden districts, the Centre has called for greater enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour in the state. The teams found masking and physical distancing lacking in almost all places they visited. Alerting towards a worsening situation, they pointed out that over half a dozen districts are facing an acute manpower shortage, hospitals in at least four are nearing capacity and while oxygen supply is an issue in another four. The feedback from teams was shared by Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan with state principal health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas on Saturday. The central teams have been focusing on ground efforts towards testing, contact tracing, containment, enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour, infrastructure and vaccination. The findings have been shared for 20 districts, including, Satara, Sangli, Aurangabad, Nagpur, Pune, Nandurbar, Bhandara, Palghar and Osmanabad, among others. The teams found the occupancy rates of hospital beds in Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Nagpur and Nandurbar to be nearing capacity. In Ahmednagar, for instance, the isolation and ICU beds had 100% occupancy, while 81% ventilator beds were full. Aurangabad was relying on neighbouring districts for management of critical patients, the team opined. Medical oxygen supply was an issue in Bhandara, Palghar, Osmanabad and even Pune. The Centre has asked that the hospital and district level officials start planning to augment supply immediately. Ventilators were found malfunctioning in Satara and Latur. Containment measures were found to be sub-optimal in Satara, Sangli and Aurangabad with lack of active surveillance for influenza-like illnesses. “Efforts at surveillance and contact tracing were found to be sub-optimal in Buldhana, Satara, Aurgangabad and Nanded too, mostly due to limited manpower engaged in this task. The team from Bhandara has reported that most cases are being reported from outside of containment zones,” the report stated. Bhushan, in his letter, said that testing capacity in Satara, Bhandara, Palghar, Amravati, Jalna and Latur were already “overwhelmed”, which was causing a delay in reporting of test results. Nanded and Buldhana are also doing less than 70% RT-PCR tests. The team found there was community resistance to testing in Bhandara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-bed-oxygen-staff-shortages-across-state/articleshow/82022806.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Of the 6,189 recipients, 4,997 were in the 45-59 years age group and the rest were above 60. In all, 71 centres carried out the drive, including 49 government facilities. Although 40 private hospitals were expected to take part in the drive, only 22 facilities gave jabs on Sunday and 2,550 people took the jabs there. Ghaziabad, with a target of 18,000 fared better and 8,112 people were vaccinated on Sunday across 89 centres (68 were government facilities). Of the 39 private hospitals that were supposed to inoculate people, 18 did not administer the vaccine.In all, 791 people were inoculated in private hospitals and 7,321 people got the jabs at 68 government centres. Most of the recipients (8,068) were in the 45-59 years category.Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY inaugurated the tika utsav from the community health centre at Bhangel on Sunday morning. “All those eligible should get the vaccine,” he said. Dr Neeraj Tyagi, district immunisation officer in-charge of Covid vaccination, Gautam Budh Nagar, said: “We held tika utsav at 71 centres. Many private hospitals will be vaccinating people from Monday.” According to sources, vaccines reached Ghaziabad around 6.30 am on Sunday and by 9 am, the stock was distributed among the government centres. In Gautam Budh Nagar, the district health department officials said there was no shortage of vaccines. “Adequate supplies were given to all private hospitals. But many facilities do not operate on Sundays. We expect better response from Monday,” said Dr Tyagi, adding that 80,000 doses of Covishield had come in on Saturday evening.Officials said 200 doses of Covishield were given to Prakash Hospital and 500 doses of the vaccine were given to Child PGI, that inoculated 200 people on Sunday.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘How can we be specialists if we’re on Covid-19 duty’||Resident doctors in several government medical colleges recently went on protest before calling off the stir following assurances from the state government. Dr Dnyaneshwar Dhobale Patil, president of the central committee of the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors, says problems faced by his fraternity are genuine and need urgent attention. Patil spoke to TOI on the issue.Q: Why did resident doctors threaten to withdraw services in the middle of a pandemic?A: Resident doctors are medical postgraduate trainees. Technically, we are MBBS doctors, but we are here as PG students. We have been working tirelessly since the past one year in the war against Covid-19, dedicating nearly half of our training period towards this cause. We have tried to fulfil our responsibilities as doctors to the best of our abilities but it should not be forgotten that we are students. We had threatened to withdraw services because we are facing severe academic losses.Q: As PG doctors, you are getting on-the-job training in the Covid-19 period too.A: All resident doctors irrespective of their specialties are working in Covid wards instead of their own departments. We are here to be trained as specialist doctors in various fields. This training is now being irreversibly hampered due to repeated shifts in Covid-19 wards. We have a training period of three years to become a competent specialist doctor. More than one-third of that time has been spent in Covid wards. If this continues then we won’t have the necessary skills needed by the end of our training period. We are being shunted to fill the gaps in our public health system.Q: How does this affect the healthcare system at large?A: Resident doctors are being used as a stopgap solution, doing every minute thing related to patient care. This work is supposed to be done by doctors employed by the public health department and not by students. This is a tremendous waste of human resources and will lead to a generation of inadequately trained ‘specialist doctors’.Q: But why did you raise issues in the middle of the second wave?A. Almost a year into the pandemic, government hospitals should have been developed by now. And our GMCs which are tertiary care centers should be used for patients needing specialist care.Q: What is the way out if residents are spared?A: Doctors employed by the public health department could take over day-to-day patient care, while resident doctors can be given supervisory roles. Initially, resident doctors were recruited for Covid services. Only when patient load increased were medical officers appointed. And when the situation was brought under control, medical officers were relieved of Covid duty instead of relieving residents so that they could continue with their academics.Q; What kind of relaxations are you expecting from government?A: Resident doctors have received no exemption in fees. This was the year in which our academics suffered at the cost of Covid duties. No exemption has been provided for thesis submission too, which is grossly unfair. Our tertiary care centre was converted into a dedicated Covid care centre which further reduced flow of patients.Q: Are your demands being fulfilled?A: As of now, we have only received assurances.

The police had gone slow on the violators on Saturday but took stringent action on the second day. Around 106 persons were pulled up for not wearing masks and fined Rs3,800. In action against violations of Covid distancing norms, Rs 7,400 was collected in fine from 61 persons. The traffic police, under DCP Sarang Awad, penalized around 179 persons for various violations and collected Rs13,000 in fine from them. The traffic police also detained several vehicles from violators who ventured out of their homes without valid reasons. Several roads were deserted after the police force stepped out after the sunset. Even before the ‘night curfew’ hour started at 8pm, vehicular and public movement had reduced considerably on the roads. The police had placed barricades at most of the junctions on important arterial roads like Central Avenue and Wardha Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-act-tough-fine-violators-of-covid-norms/articleshow/82021795.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Goa||For first time in 6 months, over 4,000 active Covid-19 cases in Goa||PANAJI: The state's active Covid-19 count on Sunday crossed the 4,000-mark for the first time since October 15 last year. As 525 new infections pushed the total to 4,322, the state's positivity rate too soared to an alarming 21%. Mortalities, too, are rising. The first week of April (12) has seen thrice as many Covid-19 deaths than the first week of March (4). On Sunday, two more deaths were registered, taking the state's death toll to 849. A health official said that Covid-19 seems to be more infectious during this second wave. “Last year, we saw young people get infected first and then it took time for older persons to present with symptoms,” he said. “Now, we are seeing entire families test positive at the same time. It is very worrying and everyone needs to be careful until everyone is vaccinated.” As cases continue to rise, pressure on hospitals too increases. On Sunday, 57 persons were hospitalised, and 216 opted for home isolation. The recovery rate, meanwhile, has fallen to 91.7%. One of Sunday's deaths was that of a 73-year-old man from Porvorim with diabetes and hypertension, who had severe pneumonia and was in hospital for five days. The other was a 66-year-old man from Ponda with diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and nephropathy. "The patient was admitted with primary diagnosis of congestive cardiac failure with an underlying ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy," said GMC dean and in-charge of Covid hospitals, Dr S M Bandekar. Margao recorded over 50 cases on Sunday, pipping Porvorim to have the highest number of cases with 438. Porvorim followed with 437. Other major centres were Ponda with 335, Panaji with 311, Candolim with 299, Cortalim with 272, Mapusa with 253, and Vasco with 206.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/for-first-time-in-6-months-over-4k-active-covid-19-cases-in-goa/articleshow/82021242.cms||Lisa Monteiro

The university aims to expand and develop its southwest and northwest campuses and start a college and a research centre there. Last Tuesday, DU acting vice-chancellor PC Joshi and other officials, including dean of colleges Balaram Pani, visited Roshanpura near Najafgarh where DU plans to open a college catering to students from rural areas. The 10-acre land was allotted to DU in 1989. Pani said there were plans to build a college there soon. In 2019, the Union education ministry had said that DU would build the college by 2023. The VC also visited Shahbad Dairy, where a plant genetic research centre is expected to come up on 40 acres allotted to DU by DDA. “The university is seriously considering developing a northwest campus devoted to plant sciences, like agriculture, horticulture, forestry and plant genetics teaching and research. There is also a plan to set up a science-based campus there with new courses,” Joshi said. However, Joshi clarified that a centre of the university would be built there for now. “Such centres are essential to help cut down travel for students to North Campus for various services, including certificates. We want to create these facilities across the city on our new campuses,” he added. Joshi said the new campuses would help increase intake capacity and diversify teaching. “We do not have courses in agriculture or forestry. We want to develop state-of-the-art facilities and research centres for every field,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/with-2-new-centres-du-to-widen-reach-by-july/articleshow/82022110.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

The naval officer, identified as Rahul Kumar, who hails from Ranchi, along with Kolkata resident Maumini Ganguly and three other friends decided to walk across the bridge around midnight when the Matysagandha Express proceeding to Margao passed over the bridge. The friends of the deceased raised an alarm and alerted authorities after they could not find the two. While Kumar’s body was found soon, authorities were unable to find Ganguly’s body. Naval divers were deployed and her body was found downstream river Mandovi on Sunday morning. Naval personnel along with helicopters were scouring the scene of the incident to try and piece together the events that led up to the accident. Further inquiries are on to understand what led the duo to walk along the darkened bridge at 12.30am. The families of the victims have also been informed and naval authorities are working with Goa police on the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/navy-man-woman-knocked-over-by-train/articleshow/82022105.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Shahabuddin Ansari and Sarif Ansari allegedly conned Sunita Dewan, a resident of Sector 23, into sharing her bank details while posing as customer care executives over telephone. Dewan had not been receiving SMS alerts after withdrawing cash from her account in Punjab National Bank (PNB). She searched for a customer care number of PNB on a search engine on Internet. After some time, she said she started receiving multiple calls, with the persons claiming to be calling from PNB customer care centre. She said she shared details of her ATM card number, PIN number and OTP. Later, the accused fraudulently withdrew Rs 11.93 lakh from her account. After verifying the mobile numbers and bank account in which the money was transferred, a cyber cell team under the supervision of inspector Devinder Singh reached Jamtara and caught the two on April 7 and obtained their transit remand. Police recovered a swipe machine, three mobile phones and debit cards from them. Police said the accused had cheated hundreds of people online. A court remanded them in police custody till April 19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bros-dial-rs-12l-fraud-from-jamtara-held/articleshow/82020501.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||A smart system that puts ambulances in the fast lane||HYDERABAD: Today, if an ambulance carrying a critical patient or organ for transplantation needs to reach its destination quickly, it requires a posse of traffic policemen on the ground to clear its path and provide priority passage. What if there was a traffic signalling system that could hear an approaching ambulance and automatically flick the signals to create a green channel? This may soon become a reality with researchers from a private college in Chennai developing an internet of things (IoT) based traffic signal control system that creates a green channel for ambulances using sensors. The control system is designed to ensure a lower vehicular waiting time for ambulances than the traffic control systems in use. As part of this system, sound detectors are installed 120 metres before each traffic signal and on every signal pole. The sensors figure out when an ambulance is approaching in a particular lane by detecting the sound of its siren. The captured ambulance sound is processed using IoT and sent to the traffic signal pole to enhance the traffic clearance. Once the ambulance has crossed the signal, the sensor sitting on the traffic signal pole detects the ambulance siren’s receding sound and signals the system that its time to switch back to normal mode. “The sensors detect the ambulance sound and send a signal to the traffic controller, which then changes the light in that particular lane to green and all other lanes are changed to red using Arduino UNO, a microcontroller used for IoT functions,” said Prof R Reeta, assistant professor, department of computer science and engineering, Rajalakshmi Engineering College, Chennai. The best part about this solution is that it is simple and affordable. “The implementation cost is minimal as it does not involve any complex hardware installation. We just need good quality sensors that do not cost more than Rs 400-500 each. This system was developed to provide an automated environment and save human lives,” said Prof Reeta. The research team also analysed the efficiency of this IoT-based sound sensor system over other methods of traffic clearance such as image processing, android, GPS and found it to be faster and more efficient in reducing ambulance delays. The research has been published in the International Journal of Engineering and Advanced Technology in February 2020. While virtual demonstrations were conducted by the researchers, they could not take up physical demonstrations due to Covid-19 induced lockdowns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/a-smart-system-that-puts-ambulances-in-the-fast-lane/articleshow/82021244.cms||Preeti Biswas

Currently, around 5,000 patients are admitted at various private and corporate hospitals in the state, especially in and around the city, pushing bed availability to the brink. “During the first wave, majority of the lower-class population already got affected. In the current wave, we are seeing more of middle-class and above getting affected. This is the reason we are seeing a large number of admissions in the private hospitals. Currently around 2,000 patients are admitted in government hospitals in the state while nearly 5,000 patients are in private hospitals,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director of public health, Telangana. “This is going to be the more pronounced in the coming days and everyone who has not got affected earlier will get affected this time,” the director added. Apart from upscaling testing and surveillance, the state health department has also increased vaccination centres and has ramped up vaccination in the recent days.   Meanwhile, sources at corporate hospitals too confirm the latest trend of upper middle-class residents getting infected more this time. “It is largely due to lapses on part of the public that entire families are landing up for treatment. Several people have admitted to taking things easy and attending social gatherings in recent days,” said an official from one of the corporate hospitals.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); While admissions have already increased in private and corporate hospitals, the number of complaints against hospitals for overcharging has also started pouring in. “Since majority of the patients from the middle and upper middle-class prefer the private healthcare setup and are able to foot the bills, the few who might be cash strapped are now approaching the health department with complaints. So far, less than 10 complaints have been received and out of them, only a few are about pricing,” said a source from the state health department.

Leaders of the two outfits demanded action against the Delhi Police team which allegedly carried out the operation. Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal claimed that Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh was “directly responsible” for atrocities being inflicted on youth who participated in the farmers’ protest. “We want to ask Amarinder why is he allowing Delhi Police to indulge in such acts? Delhi Police do not have any jurisdiction in Punjab, but Amarinder is allowing it to conduct raids with impunity in the state and arrest youth on flimsy charges,” said Sukhbir, adding that this needed to be stopped immediately. Sukhbir demanded the rgeistration of a case against the Delhi Police team which was allegedly involved in the abduction and assault. “We demand that you stand up to protect the rights of the youth of the state and register a criminal case against the Delhi Police team which abducted and tortured Mundi,” said Sukhbir. Sukhbir’s party was an ally of Bharatiya Janata Party before the two parted ways over the farm laws passed last year. Dal Khalsa head Harpal Singh Cheema said it was ridiculous that Delhi Police entered Punjab unchecked and abducted Gurdeep. “Lakha’s relatives are being targeted for no fault of theirs and it is ironic that Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh has maintained a studied silence by not questioning Delhi Police for violating Punjab government’s constitutional authority,” he said. Cheema demanded legal action against Delhi Police officers who took law into their hands. Citing an example of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, Cheema said she put CBI officials behind bars when they encroached on West Bengal’s jurisdiction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/must-act-over-assault-on-sidhanas-cousin/articleshow/82021246.cms||---

The earlier claim of Karnataka is that Hanuman was born on the Anjanadri hillock in Kishkinda, near Anegundi, Koppal district. Andhra Pradesh, too, has a claim – that Hanuman janmabhoomi is on one of the seven hills of Tirupati – also called Anjanadri. Raghaveshwara Bharathi, head of Ramachandrapura Mutt in Shivamogga, quotes the Ramayana, where Hanuman tells Sita he was born in seaside Gokarna. “Based on the evidence in Ramayana, we can say Gokarna is Hanuman’s janmabhoomi and Anjanadri in Kishkinda was his karmabhoomi,” he said. An expert panel formed by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) is expected to submit its study report on the matter on April 21. The panel comprises vedic scholars, archaeologists, and an Isro scientist. “We’ve mythological and archaeological evidence to prove Anjanadri in Tirupati is where Hanuman was born,” K S Jawahar Reddy, executive officer of TTD Trust Board, said. Karnataka has embarked on a project to declare Kishkinda’s Anjanadri as Hanuman’s birthplace. The hills of Kishkinda adjoining Hampi have a reference in Ramayana where it is described as the place where Lord Ram and Lakshman met Hanuman. “Now, we will develop the place as a pilgrimage centre with redemption of the tag of Hanuman Janmasthala,” Koppal district minister BC Patil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hanumans-place-of-birth-karnataka-and-andhra-pradesh-engage-in-epic-battle/articleshow/82023239.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

Claimed to have been constructed in the Nizam era, the well, which served as a drinking water source for a long time has been in a dilapidated state, despite being in one of the prime areas of the city. The state government has planned to take up restoration of the well after a Twitter user and the great grandson of Syeda Saidanimaa, Syed Meraj Nawab @nawab_meraj brought it to the notice of the authorities. “Historical Well build during the nizam era inside the premises of Saidanimaa Tomb, Secunderabad is now in very horrible condition. This well was used for drinking water and burning chiragh. Need immediate attention,” he said tagging MAUD principal secretary Arvind Kumar. Kumar responded to the tweet, saying, “We will take it up.” The state government had recently embarked upon large-scale restoration of stepwells and historical wells in Telangana. Syed Meraj Nawab also provided information on the condition of the Saidanima tomb which has remained in a neglected state since several years. “The structure’s poor state can be attributed to the irresponsible management of the tomb by a person who was wrongly appointed by the Waqf Board as its mutawali (caretaker),” he said. The Saidanima tomb, which was built over 130 years ago, is covered with layers of black deposit, which is said to have formed due to pollution caused by heavy traffic in the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nizam-era-well-to-be-restored-soon/articleshow/82021279.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Endless construction work, bumpy roads make simplest commutes treacherous in Kehri Gaon||DEHRADUN: With never-ending road construction work and potholes every few metres, residents of Kheri Gaon in Prem Nagar area of Dehradun say even a simple commute proves treacherous for them. The stretches dug up for work under the Smart City project cause waterlogging after the slightest of showers, forcing residents, most of them senior citizens and retired Army personnel, to take long detours to run daily errands. Rubi Srivastava, a resident of Kehri Gaon, said, “The condition of the road near my area is pathetic. I used to go for walks but now even that has become difficult due to the giant boulders strewn across the road. When out for a stroll, I often stumble and nearly fall.” MP Singh, a businessman in Sainik Colony who owns a paying guest (PG) accommodation, said, “Colleges like UIT (Uttaranchal Institute of Technology) have reopened and students are coming back to PGs. We were hopeful that business would pick up but students now avoid this area. Most own two-wheelers and riding those is difficult on the uneven roads we have here.” Nitin Srivastava said he had brought his father to Kehri Gaon from Sitamarhi, Bihar, for medical treatment at a Doon’s Shri Mahant Indiresh Hospital but now regretted staying in Kehri Gaon because of the condition of the roads here. “As my father was receiving medical treatment in Dehradun, we started staying at a relative’s house in Kehri Gaon. My father has undergone two operations and suffers from an abdominal ailment. Commuting on these bumpy roads is, therefore, extremely risky for us,” Nitin said. A PWD official who did not wish to be named and is involved in development works in the area, said, “These Smart City Project works will be completed soon and then the waterlogging issue will also be solved. In fact, we are working extra hours to ensure residents don’t face any inconvenience from our department.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/endless-construction-work-bumpy-roads-make-simplest-commutes-treacherous-in-kehri-gaon/articleshow/82020541.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Pharma industry seeks emergency nod to manufacture Covid drug Remdesivir||Mumbai: In a bid to increase the availability and affordability of antiviral drug, Remdesivir, the pharma industry has sought emergency approval to manufacture the Covid-19 drug, from the government. Remdesivir, being used extensively in Covid-19 therapy, is protected by a patent held by US company Gilead, with seven domestic companies holding the manufacturing license. An application for emergency approval, which is being construed as a compulsory license, could override the patent and open up production to other companies, who do not have existing tie-ups with Gilead. This would help in easing the drug's availability, and help bring prices down. With the huge rise in Covid-19 infections, domestic companies have not been able to meet the soaring demand, leading to overcharging and black marketing of Remdesivir vials in cities, including Delhi and Mumbai. The Indian Drug Manufacturers’ Association has said in a communication to India’s Drugs Controller General “in light of the emergency situation prevailing, we request (you) to allow emergency approval to all those companies holding licenses for export of the said product and also have three months’ stability data”. Looking at the sudden spurt of the Covid-19 positive patients, the licensed companies are unable to cope up with the demand of Remdesivir Injections locally, it adds. Sources told TOI that the government may soon take a decision on both the patent issue, and to cap its prices. At present, the industry's existing capacity per month is nearly 40 units, of which a substantial portion is being exported. Under compulsory licensing, a government authority can license the use of a patented invention to a third party, or government agency without the consent of the patent-holder. The TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) Agreement, as reaffirmed by Doha Declaration, recognises the right of WTO members to grant compulsory licenses, and their freedom to determine the grounds upon which such licenses may be granted. Safeguard provisions under TRIPS can be undertaken to protect public health and enhance access to medicines for poor countries. Gilead Sciences’ dru,g Remdesivir, was granted emergency use authorization by US Food and Drug Administration, for treatment of hospitalized Covid-19 patients last year. The company extended licences to domestic companies, including Cipla, Hetero, Jubilant Life Sciences, Zydus Cadila, Dr Reddy’s, Mylan and Syngene (a Biocon company) to manufacture and market the generic version. Last year, health activists, including Doctors Without Borders and Third World Network, opposed the Remdesivir patent, saying such licensing pacts are "not acceptable" amid a global health emergency. Amid the huge surge in Covid-19 cases, not only are there shortages of the antiviral drug, but also rampant black marketing and overcharging being reported. Patients at private hospitals are shelling out at least 250% more for each dose of the drug’s wholesale price of around Rs 1,000. The MRP of the different brands of Remdesivir ranges between Rs 4,000-5,400 per vial, excluding that of Zydus Cadila’s at Rs 900.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pharma-industry-seeks-emergency-nod-to-manufacture-covid-drug-remdesivir/articleshow/82022179.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

With 147 patients dying on Sunday, the region reported its highest-ever fatalities since the pandemic started. The death toll of Vidarbha region surpassed the 10,000-mark to reach 10,020. What’s more alarming is that the last 1,000 deaths were reported in just 9 days — from April 3 to April 11. The region reported its biggest-ever spike of new cases — 14,024 on Sunday. On the other hand, recoveries (6,877) were less than half of the new cases.

But on Sunday, Nagpur reported 63 deaths and the other 84 deaths were reported from rural parts of Vidarbha. This is an indicator that Covid-19 has spread in rural Vidarbha now and is claiming lives rapidly. This is scarier for the region as many rural and tribal parts of Vidarbha lack high-quality healthcare facilities.With more cases and fewer recoveries continuing, the recovery rate further dropped to 81%. Case fatality rate, despite more deaths, is still around 1.7%. Number of tests is also increasing. On Sunday, almost 70,000 samples were tested in the region. As rapid antigen tests (RATs) are now allowed, the number of tests is set to grow in the coming week. Highest-ever 26,007 tests were done in Nagpur, followed by 8,519 in Buldhana, 8,469 in Bhandara and 4,002 in Yavatmal.Nagpur reported 63 deaths, 2 less than Saturday. 36 of them were from Nagpur city, 20 from rural and 7 from other states/regions. Bhandara reported 15 deaths while Gondia 14 on Sunday. Chandrapur reported 11 deaths while Gadchiroli 7. In all, Nagpur division reported 112 of the 147 deaths, which is enough to indicate how serious the Covid-19 situation has become in the division. Amravati, on the other hand, reported 35 deaths.Yavatmal: The Covid-19 graph of Yavatmal has gone up alarmingly to 720 new positive patients in the last 24 hours.

Replying to queries on direct flight to Dallas from Hyderabad, KTR said the first direct flight to Chicago started in January and more direct flights are expected anytime soon. In the over-90 minutes interaction on twitter, he took questions on various topics like lockdown, industries and investments, civic issues, and other city-related issues apart from his favourite cricketer. He also said that the state government would issue notification for filling up vacancies in the state government departments after Nagarjuna Sagar bypoll.  The minister said that Niti Aayog is just an advisory body and said that prudence should prevail and states are supported on merit and not political considerations while replying to a citizen on whether states can do anything to get the recommendations of Niti Aayog implemented by the Centre. The Niti Aayog a few years ago recommended financial assistance to Telangana for Mission Bhagiratha and Mission Kakatiya schemes. He also rued the fact that the Kakatiya Mega Textile Park proposed in Warangal or Hyderabad Pharma City did not get any support from the Centre. On the reopening of schools, which were closed last month due to rise in number of Covid-19 cases, KTR said, “Let’s hope the pandemic slows down.” KTR said Telangana is the only state which has extended support to private school teachers as ‘we have very humane CM KCR Garu’ and asserted that the state government is committed towards fair implementation of school fee and ending malpractices in corporate schools. He asked the parents to bring specific issues to the notice of the government. He said the second phase of T-Hub at Rayadurg would be inaugurated in a couple of months. The minister said land acquisition for Hyderabad Pharma City has been completed and that the government would start allotment of land to investors soon. KTR said the Nacharam-Cherlapally IT corridor development would start soon and said the government had approved a few private developers’ proposal to build IT parks in East Hyderabad as part of GRID policy. On a question on who would win in the West Bengal and Kerala assembly elections, KTR evaded a direct answer and said, “End of the day, democracy should win.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/imposing-lockdown-not-a-good-idea-says-ktr/articleshow/82021295.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Agra||UP districts prepare to face Covid-19 surge||MEERUT/AGRA: With a surge in Covid-19 cases across Uttar Pradesh, district administrations are preparing to face the second wave of the pandemic at ground zero. A red alert has been sounded with the nine-day Navratri festival and Ramzan due to begin next week. Besides, the state is also gearing up for the four-phase panchayat polls, campaigning for which has begun. In Meerut, district magistrate K Balaji has ordered the chief medical officer to increase the number of beds at all the medical facilities. At present, over 1,000 beds are available for Covid patients in government and private health facilities in Meerut district. “While there is no shortage of beds in Meerut currently, the number of beds at the medical facilities need to be increased so that the health department is on alert and not taken by surprise whenever the cases increase,” Balaji said. The decision comes at a time when the district registered 210 cases on Saturday, the maximum number this year. In Agra, 119 people tested Covid-19 positive on Sunday, the maximum in the last six months. One person died due to comorbidity complications. The district is already facing a shortage of hospital beds and has run out of Remdesivir injections used to treat Covid patients. District magistrate Prabhu N Singh said, “Following government orders, a decision has been taken to restrict public movement from 9:00 pm to 6 am for eight days from Monday. Essential services and emergency movement will not be affected.” Health staffers will be allowed to travel during the restricted hours on the basis of their identity card. So will those involved in sanitation work, water supply, food supply and private security. Passengers having rail or bus ticket will not be stopped. Nor will movement of goods carriers be restricted. Movement on highways and large-scale construction work will continue as usual. Mathura administration has also imposed night curfew from 9 pm to 6 am from April 11 in order to curb the transmission of the deadly virus. According to the health department, 171 persons have tested positive for the disease since Saturday evening.

---||Kolkata||4 lakh Covishield doses set to land in Kolkata today||KOLKATA: Vaccination resumed at most private hospitals following a lull due to short supply on Saturday. A fresh consignment of Covishield — set to arrive in Kolkata on Monday evening — is expected to bring some relief from the current crisis over depleting stock. On Sunday, while some private hospitals received their normal quota of vials, others continued with what was in stock. Most Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) centres, however, remained shut due to lack of supply. A GoAir flight from Pune carrying 34 cases of Covishield with 40,000 vials — or 4 lakh doses — will touch down in Kolkata at 4.50pm on Monday. However, with the drive requiring 1.5 lakh-2 lakh doses a day, the stock will last barely two-three days. There are no reports yet of further replenishment. The city has so far received 18 consignments of Covid vaccines — 13 were Covishield from Pune and the rest were Covaxin from Hyderabad. Altogether, 1,022 packages have reached the city. Of these, there were 826 boxes of Covishield and 196 boxes of Covaxin. With the supply of Covidshield remaining low, most hospitals received Covaxin vials. At AMRI Hospitals, 348 recipients were vaccinated at two of its centres — Dhakuria and Mukundapur— but the Salt Lake unit couldn’t inoculate any due to unavailability of vaccine since Saturday. At AMRI Dhakuria, 193 people were vaccinated on Sunday, including 17 senior citizens and 38 from the 45-59 age group who took Covishield. Another 138 recipients opted for Covaxin, of which 88 were senior citizens and 50 were from the 45-59 age group. At the Mukundapur unit, 155 received vaccination, including 66 senior citizens and 87 from the 45-59 age group, apart from two healthcare workers who received their second dose. All of them took Covishield. A crowd had built up at AMRI Salt Lake even though the hospital announced that vaccines will not be administered on Sunday. “Since the Co-WIN portal accepted registrations for the hospital on Sunday, many had turned up,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. The KMC’s vaccination drive was hit for the third consecutive day by non-availability of doses. “Of the 80 urban primary health centres that are vaccinating people across the city, we could open just a few which had stock,” a civic official said. RTIICS inoculated 213 recipients. “We are thankful to the health department for the supply of vaccines on Sunday. The recipient number was almost three times that of last Sunday,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. The hospital also vaccinated 30 members of an old-age home (Alo Disha) and Missionaries of Charity. Peerless Hospital vaccinated 169 recipients. KMC centres that opened witnessed long queues. At the Bansdroni clinic, the registration counter was shut after an hour of opening and registering 100 people. Mitali Chatterjee, a homemaker from Brahmapur, said she had spent over an hour in the queue, but could not get herself registered. “We were to keep all our centres open even on weekends and holidays in April. But we can’t due to non-availability of vaccines,” a KMC official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/4-lakh-covishield-doses-set-to-land-in-city-today/articleshow/82021366.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Except for two brands, rates of the other brands are on the higher side. We have now made an appeal to ensure not more than 10% should be charged above the cost price, leaving it to the conscious of the sellers viewing the pandemic crisis,” he said. “We may also shortly display rates of the Remdesivir brands on the website. The patients and their kin must know the rates of Remdesivir and refuse to pay if the rate is more than the prescribed one,” he said. Despite the collector’s notification and appeal, TOI has learnt that many customers had to pay higher price for Remdesivir after hospitals claimed to be running short of stocks even for their indoor patients. On Sunday, the shortage continued in city with stockists and distributors waiting for the consignments to reach them till late evening. Collector Thakare also stated that he would soon issue an order prohibiting the Covid hospitals from asking the patients and their kin to arrange for Remdesivir injections from outside other than in house pharmacies.In the latest initiative,Thakare had teamed up with the Indian Medical Association (IMA) president Dr Archana Kothari, Vidarbha Hospital Association (VHA) convener Dr Anup Marar and other senior doctors to make an appeal to the both medical fraternity and public for controlled and regulated use of Remdesivir. Thakare mentioned that the patients of only ‘E’ and ‘F’ categories with certain severity, as per the guidelines of the state-level task force for Covid-19 management and that of the Indian Medical Council and Research (ICMR) should be administered Remdesivir.Dr Kothari has made an appeal to patients to keep faith on their doctors and not make a demand for Remdesivir. Dr Marar warned of adverse effects and reactions of Remdesivir if not taken under the supervision of clinical experts. In yet another development, mayor Dayashankar Tiwari too made an appeal to the NMC to arrange for 5,000 vials of Remdesivir immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/collector-caps-remdesivir-sale-at-10-above-cost-price/articleshow/82021304.cms||Soumitra Bose

Those seen violating the order will be subject to stringent action, even imprisonment. “Any deviation in this regard shall attract prosecution under Section 51 and 60 of Disaster Management Act 2005 and Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant),” chief secretary Somesh Kumar said in his order. Health minister Eatala Rajender had said on Saturday that self regulation, especially wearing masks, is equal to lockdown in order to control the rising number of cases.

---||Goa||Dy collector rejects Mapusa candidate’s caste certificate||Panaji: The deputy collector and sub divisional officer of Bardez-I, has rejected the application for OBC caste certificate of Francisco Thomas Carvalho contesting the Mapusa municipal elections. The deputy collector found that there was no adoption order or any other synonymous document to substantiate that the applicant was adopted by a family of a Christian kharvi community or otherwise acquired the name of a family belonging to Christian kharvi community. The deputy collector also observed that no certificate of caste is issued to any family member of the applicant, thus, there is “no sufficient evidence which would tilt the preponderance of probability in favour of the applicant”. Although the applicant produced a certificate by secretary of the Traditional Fishermen’s Association of North Goa Peter Menon citing that the applicant belongs to the Christian kharvi community dated March 19, 2021, the association revoked the certificate on March 27, 2021. Subsequently, the applicant produced a letter from the same association stating that the certificate was restored. It was brought on record that the inspector general of societies or the North Goa district registrar had not renewed the association’s registration and it had become an unregistered Society. “In light of the above information, it can be inferred that the certificate certifying that the applicant belongs to Christian/ Catholic kharvi community cannot be considered as the same is under a cloud of suspicion and the integrity of the same can be easily assailed. Moreover, it cannot be considered as an additional evidence in view of the lapse of its registration and subsequent non-renewal,” deputy collector Kapiil Phadte stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dy-collector-rejects-mapusa-candidates-caste-certificate/articleshow/82022184.cms||---

The chidren had gone missing while playing near the house in Badal Colony flats on Saturday evening. At that time, the children’s father was at work, however, the mother, who is mentally unstable, at home. When a social worker Rajveer Singh found the children, near village Jhabewal, a few kilometres away from their house, he took the children to police station Jamalpur. Additional deputy commissioner of police-IV Rupinder Kaur Sra said, “A social worker had found both children near village Jhabewal and took them to police station. The children only their names. They did not know the name of their residential locality, neither the mobile number of their father. It was quite tough to trace their family.” “We asked the children for landmarks near their house. Every information shared by them were verified by our team. We had also circulated pictures and information on social media. When the children shared that they live in ‘uchi building’ we figured they meant flats. After that we realised that they must be from Badal Colony flats. Before police could reach there, the police received a call from children’s father Shatrugan who had seen a post of Ludhiana police related to his missing children,” added ADCP Sra.

The movement begun on change.org has gained momentum across the country and many students from the city have joined in. City schools have, however, advised students to not press the panic button and get involved in too much activism, which might affect their studies in the run-up to the boards. CBSE board exams are due to start on May 4 and end on June 11 while ICSE and ISC examinations will start on May 4 and end on June 18 “If I get infected during the exam, will I write again at the end of my quarantine? What about others in the same exam hall?” asked a CBSE Class XII student of a city school who has joined the movement along with her classmates. “My grandparents have been vaccinated, but is that a guarantee against the infection I might bring in with me? None of us have been vaccinated,” said another student. Students have pleaded for an online exam, but they are not sure if such an important exam can be written at home. Most have said they want the boards to defer the tests and hold it offline later. “We are sending out a guideline to students and parents asking them not to panic. It is not as if the board is unaware of the Covid scenario. It has the best interests of students in mind. Till now, we have not received any instructions about change in dates and precious time should not be lost by students,” said Meena Kak, director of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy. Birla High School principal Loveleen Saigal was not sure if her boys had joined the movement. “They are apprehensive but we have asked them to keep their cool and concentrate on their studies. We are counselling them in the virtual classes.” Rammohan Mission School head Sujoy Biswas and Seema Sapru, head of Heritage, agreed. “Children should not waste time in activism just before their exams,” Biswas said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/schools-make-no-activism-appeal-to-boards-students/articleshow/82021419.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Chairman of board, Sukhwinder Singh Bindra said on Sunday, the PYDB will soon be organising such camps across the state.

We inaugurated two such camps at Shaheed Baba Deep Singh Gurdwara Sahib and Atam Vidya Mandir School, Sahnewal on Saturday. PYDB is making concerted efforts to administer the dose of the Covid19 vaccine to all eligible people and PYDB will leave no stone unturned to ensure speedy coverage of those eligible at the earliest,” said Bindra.

The CBI is likely to record Deshmukh's statement this week. The two staffers — Sanjeev Palande and Kundan Shinde — were questioned on the basis of statements given by Singh and arrested API Sachin Waze, who have claimed that the duo was privy to Deshmukh's demands, said sources. The duo was grilled at the DRDO guest house in Santacruz, said officials. Singh had alleged in a letter that Palande was present when Deshmukh allegedly asked Waze to extort over Rs 100 crore a month from bars and restaurants in Mumbai. Similarly, Waze had purportedly claimed that Kundan was present during the demands made by Deshmukh. The CBI has filed a preliminary inquiry into the matter on the Bombay high court's order and has to submit a report by early next week. It will inform the high court whether or not a regular case is made out and if an in-depth investigation is required. On Friday, the agency had questioned former Mumbai police constable Vinayak Shinde and bar owner Mahesh Shetty in the case. Shinde was arrested by the National Investigation Agency in the Mansukh Hiren murder case. The CBI also recorded the statement of DCP Raju Bhujbal and questioned Singh and Waze again on Friday. The CBI has also sought the diary and documents that were seized from Waze. The CBI also recorded the statements of two drivers working for Waze. Singh first wrote a letter to the chief minister stating that Deshmukh had called Waze and assistant police commissioner (ACP) Sanjay Patil along with deputy police commissioner (DCP) Raju Bhujbal separately at his official residence in south Mumbai and made his demand. In his letter to the CM, Singh alleged that when Deshmukh had called Waze at his official residence, one or two staff members of the minister, including Palande, were present. In a letter that Waze wanted to submit to the special court during his remand and which was circulated in the media, it was alleged that Kundan Shinde was present when Deshmukh made his extortion demand. The letter said Shinde suggested that Waze comply with Deshmukh’s demand to keep his police job. Waze said to the CBI that he had informed Singh about the demand.

For last two days, Dr Banejee had been struggling for breath and an ambulance that could take her to a hospital with a BiPAP oxygen concentrator facility. Though her students took her in their personal vehicle to a Chandkheda-based Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) designated Covid hospital on Saturday noon, she was refused admission as she was not brought in an EMRI 108 ambulance, as mandated by the AMC. The students including a faculty member travelled back with Dr Banerjee to the same Gandhinagar-based private hospital where she was being treated, till arrangements could be made for her. On Friday evening, Dr Banerjee had complained of a small breathing difficulty. “Her oxygen saturation levels hovered between 90 and 92,” claims a colleague who was aware of the issue. Her close colleagues and a few students at the university, rushed her to the civil hospital in Gandhinagar which was already packed. Overwhelmed by the rush there Dr Banerjee requested her colleagues to shift her to a private hospital on Pethapur-Mahudi road on Saturday. Soon after, the hospital too claimed that it was short of BiPAP oxygen concentrator and that she would require one soon. Till evening, all hospitals were running full and Dr Banerjee’s saturation levels dropped to 60%. “By 2am the Gandhinagar hospital tried all their means and arranged a BiPap and a ventilator for the professor. But it was a little late by then and she did not survive owing to rapid chest infection,” says a close associate. Dr Seema Rawat, a close associate who was present along with a few students and faculty members beside Dr Banerjee said, “We are taking her to the crematorium. Dr Banerjee’s husband has just arrived from Punjab. I cant say anything more.” Dr Banerjee was among leading experts in Nanoscience. A post-doctoral fellow at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre ( BARC ), she was a visiting academician at National Physical Laboratory (NPL), London, a post-doctoral research associate at the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department as well as a visiting scientist at the University of California, US.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-ambulance-no-admission-prof-dies-gasping/articleshow/82021444.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||34% of EMRI calls in April for suspected Covid||Ahmedabad: A visit to the call centre of EMRI at Kathwada looks like a frantic operation – the calls never cease to ring as the executives of EMRI 108 and 104 (fever helpline) get questions from across Gujarat about Covid-19 and dispatch ambulances to take them to hospitals. EMRI officials said that April has remained their busiest month so far in the pandemic. “Compared to 24% calls of the total calls to 108 in September – which was the earlier high –in April so far, 34% of the calls are about suspected Covid-19 patients. If we see daily calls, the average calls in November – the month of earlier surge –was the highest at 3,217. In the first 10 days of April, we are fielding 3,967calls,” said a senior official. Jashvant Prajapati, COO of EMRI Gujarat, said that the services have increased their fleet and scope of service with addition of new vehicles and personnel. “The analysis of fever helpline calls can give an indication on the trends for 108 calls, too. The entire staff is dedicated to extend support to the citizens,” he said. While the ambulance pile-ups at hospitals such as Civil Hospital are becoming a common sight, the experts also pointed at increased call levels due to unavailability of beds. A senior official told TOI that patients are hopeful of getting a bed in a hospital of their choice. “But when the vehicle reaches the spot, the bed category(ICU or ventilator for example) might be taken. Thus, he/she is taken to another hospital and so on,” said the official. It’s also a field day for the 104 fever helpline. On an average, the executives field two calls per minute in April so far where the callers ask about symptoms, nearest hospital, testing protocols, home quarantine tips and so on. “Out of total calls, 35% were about Covid-19. Out of 20,000-odd calls, the counsellors could identify suspected symptoms in about 28% of the calls who were advised testing and other protocols. We try to tell them not to panic and also educate them about different treatment protocols for mild, moderate and severe cases,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/34-of-emri-calls-in-april-for-suspected-covid/articleshow/82021495.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Kazi cooperating and may be made approver in case’||MUMBAI: API Riyazuddin Kazi, who was arrested on Sunday in the Ambani explosives and Mansulk Hiran murder case, is learnt to have said to the NIA that he had followed API Sachin Waze’s orders as he was heading the CIU. Sources said that Kazi was cooperating with the investigation and had given leads in the case, and that he might be made an approver. In the CIU, Kazi was part of all high-profile cases in the recent past, including the fake Twitter accounts case, the call centre racket, the TRP manipulation scam and the case of dual registration of vehicles involving car designer Dilip Chhabria. Kazi was recently transferred to the local arms unit and, like Waze, is likely to be suspended. In court, public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves, seeking custody for 10 days, said: “The duo [Waze and Kazi] started to destroy the evidence after the case was handed over to NIA on March 8. Kazi was well aware of the entire matter as the Scorpio, whose theft case was registered at Vikhroli police station and later was used in planting gelatine sticks near Antilia, was parked inside Waze’s apartment in Thane, but he did not raise an alarm.” Defence counsel Hasnain Kazi said Riyazuddin Kazi had been made a scapegoat in the case. “My client has maintained a diary entry of everything,” he said. “If he was involved then why would he make a diary entry?” Earlier, another police official close to Waze, assistant police inspector (API) Prakash Howald, had been questioned by the NIA, though he was not arrested. Besides Waze and Kazi, the other two arrested in the case so far are dismissed police constable Vinayak Shinde, who was convicted a few years ago in a murder case, and Gujarat bookie Naresh Gor, who is accused of supplying the SIM cards used by Waze and others to communicate with one another.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-kazi-cooperating-and-may-be-made-approver-in-case/articleshow/82022186.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Kolkata||No campus return yet, session to start online for all classes||KOLKATA: Many schools of the city are reopening on Monday, while some are due to start the new session next week. However, everyone has decided on a virtual restart for the time being, even for students of classes IX-XII. With Covid cases on the rise, schools that had earlier decided to call senior kids to campus have decided against it. Some schools have pushed back the resumption to next week because of the ongoing practical examinations on campus where additional teachers are required to ensure that all Covid protocols are maintained. However, all schools have shared their online timetables with students. Schools say that unlike last year, they are now more confident that teaching-learning will be seamless on the virtual platform. A lot of written work and assignments have been woven into the new routines to fill up the gaps noticed last time and periods have been earmarked for oral question-answer sessions. “Things are still not favourable for a campus re-start and we are holding our board practicals now. But we have made our new routine extremely interactive and I am sure children will be happy to be “back”, albeit, virtually,” said Heritage School principal Seema Sapru. South Point School spokesperson Krishna Damani said, “We have sent a circular to students of classes IX-XII that we are going online for the moment.” Though textbooks are being home delivered, it is taking a long time. But schools said they would go ahead with the re-opening without delay because teachers will get PDFs of chapters and digital links will be circulated on class WhatsApp groups. “Soft copies of all study material will be shared with students till they get text books,” said Meena Kak, director of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy. “Digital versions will be shared with students who have not received text books yet,”said DPS Newtown principal Sonali Sen. Birla High School has pushed back its re-opening from this Monday to the next. “We have re-designed our routine and have a lot of digital study material to make the virtual classes interesting,” said principal Loveleen Saigal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-campus-return-yet-session-to-start-online-for-all-classes/articleshow/82021486.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Nagpur||No RTPCR tests due to backlog, only antigen tests in public labs till Thursday||Nagpur: Citizens won’t be able to get an RTPCR test done till Thursday at any of the public testing or swab collection centres run by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). On Sunday, the NMC issued a press release stating that these centres will perform only rapid antigen tests (RAT). Due to increasing Covid cases and rush at testing centres, all the four public labs at IGGMCH, AIIMS, GMCH and Nagpur University have huge backlog of results. However, the NMC press release didn’t mention anything about CSIR Neeri lab, which has been using dry swab method. NMC officials said there is no backlog at that lab. Yet, it was not clear if Neeri lab would continue testing as it receives samples only from RPTS testing centre of NMC. The decision to stop RTPCR on these days has been taken to clear the backlog. Beside round the clock load on PCR machines, it is also said the labs are unable to process samples due to lack of reagents. The district had been testing 20,000 samples in the last three days. Public labs will also be closed on Tuesday due to Gudhi Padwa, so sample collected on Monday and Wednesday will be subjected to RAT only. On Sunday, the civil surgeon data showed the district had processed over 26,000 samples including more than 10,000 antigen tests and as many tests in private labs. The four public labs processed close to 6,000 samples. NMC officials said still nearly 2,000 samples are pending in each of the four labs and therefore the next three days would be utilized to clear the backlog. They said citizens would get the antigen test report next day but bulk messages would be sent by evening regarding Covid status. Last week, TOI has reported twice regarding the heavy rush and delay of 3-4 days in getting test reports. Not just public labs, rush and delays are also seen in private labs where result is not available for 24 to 48 hours. Zero pendency at Neeri lab Nagpur: The CSIR-NEERI lab has no sample pending even though its daily capacity was stretched to 300 to 400 samples. In fact, the lab continues to maintain its record of reporting results in less than 3 hours each day. “Our efficiency is high in Covid testing despite the additional responsibility of sequencing positive samples to understand the dynamics of variants,” said Dr Krishna Khairnar, scientist and head, virology & Covid-19 testing centre, CSIR-NEERI, Nagpur. Neeri is processing dry swab RTPCR, which is the only ICMR approved testing centre in the country where this technique for nCov samples is in use for routine testing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-rtpcr-tests-due-to-backlog-only-antigen-tests-in-public-labs-till-thursday/articleshow/82021386.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Chennai||Chennai: Man lights cigarette after using sanitiser, injured in fire||CHENNAI: A 50-year-old carpenter is being treated for severe burns he suffered at his Ashok Nagar residence on Saturday night. Ruban had lit a cigarette minutes after cleaning his hands with a sanitiser and a spark fell on his shirt and triggered a fire, police said. A senior officer, based on a statement from the man’s family members, said Ruban had reached his house at Pudhur in Ashok Nagar late after work and immediately used a sanitiser to clean his hands. A few drops spilled on his shirt and a family member informed him of this, but Ruban said he would change his shirt anyway after a bath and went to the washroom. There he lit a cigarette, some sparks fell on his shirt and he was soon enveloped in flames, the officer said. He cried out for help and his family members rushed in and took him to the Government Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital where his condition is said to be critical. The man suffered burns to the face, neck, chest, abdomen and both hands, the officer said. Doctors said a sanitiser evaporates 2-3 seconds after application and so poses little direct threat, but added that creating a flame or lighting a cigarette immediately after using it can be risky. Dr Sivalingam of a private hospital in Porur stressed that hand sanitisers, though absolutely essential at this time, need to be handled with care. “The high ethyl alcohol content of up to 62% makes a hand sanitiser highly flammable. Never use sanitisers near a fire or a heated place. It is always advisable to use a limited quantity and allow it to dry,” he said. Alcohol-based sanitisers pose no great risk on the skin because they evaporate in seconds, he said. “People can cook or use a sanitiser near a flame, but need to be careful,” he pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/man-lights-cig-after-using-sanitiser-injured-in-fire/articleshow/82021503.cms||---

Work has started at the deputy commissioner’s office, excise and taxation building, 30 Bays Building and at the pedestrian path at Sector 17 Plaza. Senior officials are monitoring the work. “As all these government building are 70 to 80 years old and have worn out, the work to bring their original look back had been allotted. Restoration of Plaza is another area. At the moment, we are trying to give a uniform look to the pedestrian path. Issues related to air-conditioning (AC) ducts and wiring will be taken up in a phased manner. We spoke to market associations before starting the work and are getting their full cooperation,” a senior UT official said. As Sector 17 is a heritage property, sources in the UT said that restoration will be a major challenge. The works have been planned in a phased manner to ensure maximum output. “Haphazard advertisements and display boards have been giving a shabby look to Sector 17. All these issues are under consideration. We are in the touch with market associations,” an official said.

The MPF at Lalapet was established way back in the 1960s with the initiative of ‘Father of the White Revolution in India’ Verghese Kurien with a handling capacity of just 50,000 litres of milk per day. “After 60 years, we are handling four lakh litres of milk daily. We have built a strong marketing network for Vijaya brand milk products, which is next only to Amul,” the TSDDCF managing director added. “We use modern technology and ultra-high definition plants to pack milk and milk products at our MPF unit at Lalapet. Apart from milk and milk products, we also started a mineral water unit with a capacity of 50,000 litres per day since December,” he said. The machinery, including sophisticated equipment installed at MPF, has been imported, giving even private dairy units tough competition, a TSDDCF official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vijaya-dairy-verdict-a-win-for-consumers-federation-chief/articleshow/82021508.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Chennai||Weekend curbs fail as crowds flock to city beaches maskless||Chennai: It would be comical if it weren’t so dangerous. The government shut the Marina beach to keep crowds, and thus Covid, away. So morning walkers crowded the pavement along Kamarajar Salai (see photograph). Normally, the crowds would have been divided between the pavement and the service road along the beach and social distancing would have been better observed. Policemen were posted at MRTS stations and other approach roads to the Marina to dissuade people from going to the beach. But Sunday crowds were in no mood to listen. Some enterprising souls ventured on to the sands claiming they were there to buy fish. Cops in beach buggies and on horseback chased them away. Even those who came to the Namma Chennai selfie point in groups were asked to leave. Similar scenes were witnessed at other beaches in the city including Elliots at Besant Nagar and Thiruvanmiyur. If they were not allowed on the sands, people crowded where they could. Social distancing was no one’s concern. As the positive cases rose, the state government banned entry of public in all the beaches in Chennai, Chengalpet and Tiruvallur districts on all weekends, and on all government holidays to prevent spread of the second wave. Barricades have been erected and police pickets posted in all the beaches to prevent public entry. As many as 250 policemen were posted for security both on sands and service road to avoid people from gathering at the Marina. “We barricaded the stretches from Napier bridge to Srinivasapuram. The beaches on Sunday had additional deployment. We kept making announcements through the public address system to keep people from gathering at the beaches,” said deputy commissioner, East, V Balakrishnan. “I came to my sister’s home in Vysarpadi, so I decided to see Marina beach with my family. I did not know the new restrictions until the police stopped me,” says Mariappan, a resident of Villupuram. Residents complained that they were being kept away from beaches at a time when the summer heat is intensifying. But no one appeared worried about crowding in the midst of a pandemic. Frustrated policemen and policewomen were left to chase after people who really should know better.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/weekend-curbs-fail-as-crowds-flock-to-city-beaches-maskless/articleshow/82021510.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Builders eye bigger share of 7,000 acres of NDZ land||MUMBAI: Private landowners and builders are lobbying for Special Development Zone (SDZ) lands in Mumbai—roughly 7,000 acres of open and green space—to be thrown open for construction with more development rights vested in them than envisaged earlier. In 2018, the state government redefined No-Development Zones (NDZ) as SDZ. The new policy, which is still awaiting final cabinet clearance, allows developers more construction rights on such lands if they agreed to build affordable homes on 30% of their plots, retain another 15% for open spaces and 12% for public amenities. The builder would then receive the floor space index (FSI) of the entire plot to load on the remaining 43% for profits. But developers are keen that their share be increased to 66%. They want only the remaining one-third to be utilised for affordable homes, open spaces and other amenities. They claim their construction costs would increase and projects would become unviable if only 43% of the plot is made available to them. “It will make flats extremely expensive. If development is not economically viable, then nobody will take up development on NDZs,’’ said one developer. ‘NDZ policy awaits nod but landowners lobbying hard’Since the policy was announced in 2018, not a single landowner controlling no-development zone (NDZ) in Mumbai has shown interest in building affordable homes. “We haven’t received any proposal in the past three years,” said Vinod Chithore, chief of BMC’s development plan department. However, a prominent architect said: “These NDZs, now known as special development zones (SDZs), are in the excluded portion of the new development plan, which is yet to be sanctioned by the state.” Builder Niranjan Hiranandani also said the policy to convert NDZs into SDZs is awaiting approval. However, industry sources said even while the policy is awaiting approval, landowners have started lobbying with politicians to increase their share. They said the builders’ demand for a larger chunk of SDZ for themselves is because they believe more construction will help reduce prices and make homes affordable. But some sections say this has implications for open and verdant spaces along the waterfront. “If the government tweaks the rule and removes the mandatory affordable homes clause, it will be akin to what the state did with the mill land policy two decades ago,’’ said a city planner. In 2003, the government had tweaked the mill land policy to give away most of the mill lands to builders for real estate while retaining meagre portions for public housing and open spaces. A large chunk of NDZ lands are large open spaces along the beachfront starting from Madh Island, Erangal, Aksa up to Marve on one side, and then from Manori, Kulvem, Gorai, on the other. A property market expert said the roughly 7,000 acres of SDZ would have a development potential of over 100 crore sq ft with a revenue potential of Rs 3 lakh crore. Three years ago, when the city’s new development plan allowed more construction on such lands, housing experts had warned that increased density would put unbearable pressure on the already weak infrastructure. But the government defended its decision on the grounds that this would bring in affordable housing. A realtor pointed out that no affordable housing proposal has taken off since then. However, owners of these lands or those who have access to them are lobbying for permission to build on the entire land. “They have found ‘new allies’ in the government to push this proposal,” he said. With plans for building bridges from Versova to Madh and from Marve to Manori, the coastline may then become an extension to Versova and Andheri areas. “With the bridge at Marve work starting this year, the hitherto difficult to access waterfront would be a part of the premium Andheri-Malad extension belt,” said a planner. Environmentalist D Stalin of Vanshakti said the dilution of Coastal Regulation Zone coupled with relaxation in construction on NDZ lands will spell doom for the city’s coastal ecology and its indigenous communities. “Pressure is increasing from the big guns in the construction lobby to open coastal properties for massive structures with no safeguard in place as desired by the original CRZ notification.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ndz-policy-awaits-nod-but-landowners-lobbying-hard/articleshow/82022190.cms||Nauzer Bharucha

The city and Nagpur rural too reported most number of cases ever at 4,641 and 2,553, respectively. The record number of Covid cases were detected from the district’s highest-ever 26,007 tests, with rapid antigen tests constituting nearly 10,000 samples. Cases in the 11 days of April are now higher than all other months except March. Yet another day with over 5,000 cases took this month’s tally to 52,518, which is more than the September tally (48,457). March with 76,250 cases has the district’s highest caseload in a month so far. Until the second wave hit the district, September with 48,457 cases had the highest cases reported in the pandemic. The weeklong span from April 5 to April 11 reported 38,815 cases, which too is more any month’s caseload, except September and March. The city and rural both had reported a decline in daily cases after three days of surge, touching the 6,000-mark on Friday. Now, the district has crossed the 7,000-mark for the first time. The decline a day before was recorded despite the number of tests remaining above 20,000. More number of recoveries were reported at 3,240, as compared to 2,837 discharges a day before. The testing figures for the city stood at an unprecedentedly high 14,906 and for rural at 11,101. Yet, the infectivity rate of the city remained higher than that of rural. A day before, the difference was even bigger, though both city and rural had comparable testing figures. The active cases tally too reached its highest-ever mark of 55,474, leaving the district gasping for healthcare services and medicines. The district has now recorded 18.27 lakh tests in all.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/district-creates-new-record-of-daily-cases-tests/articleshow/82021505.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Ahmedabad||‘Health emergency’: CJ files PIL on corona care||Ahmedabad: Alarmed by the “uncontrolled upsurge and serious management issues in Covid control”, the Gujarat high court’s chief justice on Sunday decided to file a PIL himself. He said news reports suggest that the state is heading towards a health emergency of sorts. In his order for filing a suo motu PIL to deal with the present Covid-19 situation, Chief Justice Vikram Nath pointed to the discussion that took place between the high court and the state’s top law officers on April 6. At the time, the judges had suggested that the government take measures quickly, including short-period lockdowns to curb the rising Covid-19 cases. The law officers assured the court that they would convey its concerns to the top decision-makers. Later that day, night curfew hours were extended and the night curfew was introduced in some other cities of Gujarat. The CJ has highlighted news reports including those published in the national media and telecast on television channels and termed them “harrowing tales”. The CJ said that the news was about “unimaginable difficulties, unmanageable conditions of the infrastructure, the shortfall and the deficit of not only testing, availability of beds, ICU, but also supply of oxygen and the basic medicines like remdesivir, etc.” The CJ said that he could have ignored the situation had it been a small problem, but looking at the magnitude of the problem, the HC must intervene. The high court has ordered to implead the chief secretary, the health secretary of the state government, and the health department and the home department of the Centre as party respondents. Advocate general Kamal Trivedi and assistant solicitor general Devang Vyas have been asked to attend the hearing posted on Monday morning before the bench of Justice Nath and Justice Bhargav Karia. The CJ has ordered the top law officers of the state to inform officers concerned to witness the proceedings, which are livestreamed. The chief justice’s decision to file another PIL on the issue appears significant because the HC is already handling a suo motu PIL on the lockdown and the Covid-19 situation. The HC has been issuing a slew of directions from time to time on subjects concerning health, education, and public administration with regard to the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/health-emergency-cj-files-pil-on-corona-care/articleshow/82021506.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala: Priest issues a liturgical warning||KOCHI: ‘No mask, no mass’ reads a board outside St George Church, Kalady. Fr John Puthuva, the vicar of the church had come up with the unique message that aims to raise awareness among churchgoers about the importance of using masks in the wake of spurt in Covid cases in the state. Fr Puthuva is determined to implement the Covid protocol in his parish. “I noticed that people attending the mass were not wearing the mask properly," said Fr Puthuva. "There have been instances where people forget to wear masks as well. That shouldn’t happen, which is why we decided to send out a message that those who are not wearing masks are not welcome at the church." Fr Puthuva feels the board will make his parishioners take the Covid protocol seriously. “I have been seeing parishioners dragging their masks down during the ceremony. I have had to stop in between the ceremony, to ask them to put it back on,” said Fr Puthuva. To reduce social contacts, the priest has been conducting additional masses daily with few attendees. “On weekdays, we have an additional mass in the evening apart from the usual morning mass. On Sunday, we have three masses in the morning and one in the evening as opposed to the two masses on Sundays. We were able to limit the number of attendees to less than a hundred in every masses by increasing the number of masses,” said Fr Puthuva. The priest claims that young parishioners have been enquiring about the needs of quarantined persons irrespective of their religion. “Around 30 persons in my parish are now Covid positive. Usually, we stand at the gate of the house where the family is quarantined and ask what they need and arrange it accordingly. During Easter, we placed meat at their doorsteps so that they can cook a good meal on an auspicious day,” added the priest. Fr Puthuva's next mission is to encourage his parishioners to get vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/priest-issues-a-liturgical-warning/articleshow/82020700.cms||Disney Tom
---||Chennai||Market monitoring panels to be back on crowd control duty||Chennai: Monitoring committees formed to regulate all markets in city limits last year will be pressed into service once again as the civic body is on an overdrive to curb the spread of Covid-19 cases during the second wave. With cases on the upward spiral and the city logging more than 2,000 fresh cases on Sunday, the civic body has warned that they will not hesitate to shut down commercial establishments and markets if the norms are violated. There are 81 market areas in the city apart from Koyambedu wholesale market and they are among the places where crowding is rampant. An assistant engineer with the city corporation, subinspector from the local police and members from the market and other departments will be part of the committee that will assess the functioning every day. Apart from this, special monitoring teams from the revenue and disaster management department will also supervise the functioning of markets. The challenge, according to Chennai corporation commissioner G Prakash, will be in Kasimedu fishing harbour, where the civic body has so far remained unsuccessful in crowd control. The civic body is discussing with the fisheries department to introduce regulations that would bring down crowding there. The government had last year tried restricting the number of working hours in Kasimedu and made the area off limits for public, permitting vendors only. It also imposed restrictions on the number of boats that can sail out in a day to fish. Small and medium level fish vendors were allowed in four batches of 150 each and only after one group finished the purchase, the other group was allowed in. Mask indiscipline is something which the civic body will be particular about and imposing of fines will become stringent in the coming weeks as field survey teams (FST) headed by an IAS officer will be in place in each of the 15 zones of the city corporation. As on date, Teynampet (zone 9) has most active cases in the city with 1,622, followed by Anna Nagar (zone 8) with 1,581. “In central zones where population density is more, more cases are being recorded,” a senior official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/market-monitoring-panels-to-be-back-on-crowd-control-duty/articleshow/82021515.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||GMCH limits elective surgeries||Chandigarh: Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, has planned to limit elective surgeries and continue OPDs through online registration only, while Government Multi-specialty Hospital, Sector 16, its dispensaries and civil hospital will continue with walk-in OPDs. “The decision to stop walk-in OPDs was taken last month itself, when doctors from ENT department had tested positive for the flu. We will hold a review meeting on Monday,” said Prof Jasbinder Kaur, director-principal, GMCH. After four health workers, including technical staff and doctors, had tested positive for Covid on February 26, GMCH had suspended the OPD of the ENT department. Also, all elective surgeries had been cancelled. GMCH doctors decided they would see patients physically using online appointments. Patients are being offered consultation on telemedicine and eSanjeevani and would be seen in-person only if required. PGI was the first to announce suspension of physical OPDs from Monday owing to the surge in Covid-19 cases. “There are some online numbers given by PGI for consultation which seldom work or are attended to. In fact, it gets so tough to access doctors in case of non-Covid issues,” said a patient who belongs to Ludhiana. Most of the doctors in PGI feel as GMCH and GMSH are not referral tertiary care centres, it will be inconvenient for patients to get themselves treated. “There are rural areas where most do not know or have access to Internet. These online services are suitable for cities only,” said a faculty in GMSH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/gmch-limits-elective-surgeries/articleshow/82020702.cms||Shimona Kanwar

This is the first of multiple contracts for this new semi high-speed rail line in Gujarat where trains will travel at a top speed of 160 kmph to link both cities through 6 stations at Sabarmati, Sanand, Bavla, Limbdi, Chotila and Rajkot. The engineering firm will be engagement as a detailed design consultant (DDC) for an elevated station — at Sabarmati including the Multimodal Transport Hub, an elevated viaduct from Sabarmati to Bavla, and a stabling yard near Sabarmati under the project. Once this semi high-speed rail network comes up, commuters can board at Ahmedabad’s Sabarmati station, and easily connect to and board the 508km Mumbai – Ahmedabad bullet train as well as Ahmedabad Metro, Indian Railways station, and Janmarg BRT bus station. Currently, the bids for the project have been sent for technical evaluation which can take a few months .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/3-firms-bid-for-semi-high-speed-rail/articleshow/82021514.cms||---

These years have tested their administrative and public outreach skills to the fullest. As talks of an impending lockdown gain traction, many first time public representatives try to finely balance anger against lockdown from certain sections of their constituency with those who fervently support the strict measures. All first time MLAs said that they shared their views on lockdown with senior party leaders and are hopeful that the government takes the best possible step to stop the infection from spreading. Nagpur West MLA Vikas Thakre said the stringent measures are need of the hour. “We are all aware of the reality and the current focus must only be on breaking the infection chain. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has to ensure that people who are home quarantined do not move out freely, turning into super spreaders,” Thakre said. MLA from Tumsar, Raju Karemore, said majority of the people in his constituency understand why we need a lockdown. “The number of cases is steadily rising in rural areas and community spread is a reality. So how do we break this chain unless the unnecessary movement of people is restricted. Yes, we do have to plan for the people at the lower end of the strata, but a strict lockdown is the only option now,” Karemore said. Pratibha Dhanorkar, MLA from Warora, says government’s focus needs to be on providing for daily wagers. “There are many people who don’t even have a ration card. So local authorities must prepare a list of such daily wagers in each area and extra stock of foodgrains and oil must be supplied to ration shops there. Last year, I had spent Rs50 lakh to provide food and travel assistance to migrants,” Dhanorkar said. Pusad MLA Nilay Naik says lockdown is exactly what the state needs right now, but a proper plan has to be put in place. “Small traders are opposing the lockdown because it affects their income badly. At the same time we see a situation in which people are dying. So, for a limited period of time we must have a lockdown and I hope that the government works in close coordination with opposition parties too,” Naik said. Kishore Jorgewar, MLA from Chandrapur, said that everyone is well aware that lockdown is not the solution but in present scenario that’s the best option. “I have been taking feedback in my constituency and overall people understand that strict restrictions will ultimately benefit them. In Chandrapur, cases are rising steadily and the health infrastructure is not able to keep up. The only thing the government needs to do is to ensure that daily wage labourers are provided with ration kits to sustain themselves during this period,” Jorgewar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/first-time-mlas-support-lockdown-but-want-strict-implementation/articleshow/82022246.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||India||Travelling on Rajdhanis with modern coaches gets costlier||NEW DELHI: Travel in Rajdhani trains with upgraded modern Tejas-type coaches will cost more. The Indian Railways had introduced a 5% hike in the base fare of the Delhi-Agartala Tejas-Rajdhani train which started operation in February. Sources said all Rajdhani trains will gradually become Tejas-Rajdhani trains and the increased base fare will kick in besides flexi fare. In February, the national transporter had said 500 such Tejas-type sleeper coaches will be manufactured at Integral Coach Factory and Modern Coach Factory in 2021-22 which will gradually replace the premium long distance trains. An official confirmed that the increase in base fare across all classes in these trains will be in effect only when the Tejas rakes are inducted. Currently, 25 pairs of Rajdhani trains are being operated across the country connecting New Delhi with different state capitals. One of the justifications for increase in base fare is that passengers will get better facilities in Tejas-type coaches, including automatic plug doors. The train will not start until all doors are closed. These coaches will have bio-vacuum toilets and air suspension bogies will improve comfort and ride quality. Some of the other features of these smart coaches include emergency talk back for medical or security reasons, seats and berths having PU foam that provide better comfort to passengers. There are also mobile charging points and berth reading lights for each passenger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/travelling-on-rajdhanis-with-modern-coaches-gets-costlier/articleshow/82023243.cms||Dipak K Dash

In its Ramzan 2021 advisory issued on April 7, the WHO said those suffering from long Covid (persistence of symptoms even after recovery) can also fast, but they may break the fast in case of aggravated symptoms during the fasting hours. The WHO has also recommended vaccination during the fasting hours as the jab is intramuscular and Muslim religious scholars do not consider vaccination as a nutritional supplement. “There is no evidence to suggest that fasting can increase risk of Covid-19 infection. Should you experience lingering Covid-19 symptoms after infection, you may consider religious licences to break your fast,” the WHO said in its advisory on safe Ramzan during the second year of the pandemic. Referring to vaccination while on fast, the WHO said Covid-19 vaccine is permissible according to Shariah. “Islamic authorities in several countries have stated that receiving Covid-19 vaccination as an intramuscular injection, the only route for the vaccines currently available, does not invalidate the fast,” it said. Although preliminary evidence suggests that vaccinated individuals likely pose little risk of transmission to unvaccinated people, the WHO recommended that they should continue to exercise precautionary measures, including physical distancing of at least one metre, respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene. Guidance on mask use should also be followed. Stating that there is no zero-risk, the WHO advisory said eligible individuals should be encouraged to get vaccinated during Ramzan to protect themselves and their communities, and religious leaders should promote vaccine uptake and advocate for the continuation of vaccination campaigns without interruption. “Given the surge in Covid-19 cases associated with Ramzan-related activities observed in 2020, and the additional uncertainties, (one should) refrain from attending events if you feel unwell or if you belong to groups at high risk. Find new ways to help and interact with others by using digital communication tools and platforms,” the WHO suggested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fasting-wont-spread-covid-says-whos-ramzan-advisory/articleshow/82021537.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Goa||FC Goa ready for difficult nights at Fatorda||Panaji: Ten minutes into a video session that showed Al-Rayyan Sports Club play in the Qatar Stars League, FC Goa players knew what awaits them in the high-profile AFC Champions League. Al-Rayyan, who finished third in the league behind Al Sadd – coached by Xavi – and Al-Duhail, were irrepressible for most part. The brilliance of the team stood out, rather than any individual. They seemed perfect. Next were Persepolis FC, and the Iranian giants looked even better: strong, speedy and focused. Goa are making their debut in Asian football’s premier club competition. It’s a first for an Indian club, and they know they’ll have to endure difficult nights, even at a venue where they have been dominant. “Believe me, we have to take things minute by minute,” coach Juan Ferrando told TOI in an exclusive interview. “First the kick off, then we have to control the space in the first 10 minutes, good passes for teammates, good crosses. If everything is okay, then we move to the next level with a good press. For me, it’s minute-by-minute, game-by-game. It won’t be easy against such tough opponents.” Everything would look so different for Goa in the Champions League. A team used to having a majority of the ball in the Indian Super League, will now have to do without it. Their opponents – whether its Al-Rayyan, Persepolis or Al Wahda – are all in a different league and will look to dictate terms right from the start. So how do you tackle such giants? “FC Goa were better in the second phase (of ISL) when we had small targets. If you decide in the first game that you want to win the league, you are putting unnecessary pressure. For my team, it’s necessary to keep calm,” said Ferrando. Goa’s passage into the ISL semfinals for a record sixth time in seven seasons was largely due to the finishing of Igor Angulo. The Spanish striker rarely misfired and scored 14 goals to win the Golden Boot. His absence due to the three plus one foreign player rule could prove to be a handicap. “I was very upset (with the decision),” said Ferrando. “We needed Igor Angulo in this team, also (Alberto) Noguera. But we had to decide what’s best for the team. I didn’t like making the decision. They are very professional, good human beings, very good players. But we can have only four (foreign players).” Ferrando chose captain Edu Bedia, centre-backs James Donachie, Ivan Gonzalez and Spanish winger Jorge Ortiz as his four foreign players. Goa will take on the might of Al-Rayyan in their opening match on Wednesday at 10.30pm. Persepolis and Al Wahda will play the first game at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda at 8pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-ready-for-difficult-nights-at-fatorda/articleshow/82038864.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Chennai||Chennai: Covid second wave clashes with summer vacay plans of many||CHENNAI: City tourists with scheduled bookings for domestic and international trips this summer have started cancelling their tour programmes after rise in Covid-19 cases due to the second wave. Maldives and Dubai were the most popular overseas destinations for Chennaites as the two destinations were accepting tourists amid travel ban in many popular European destinations. Many people who visited Europe in summers had made Maldives their stop for the year, say tour operators. The tourists are now reconsidering their travel plans. The increase in cases and cancellations have raised the apprehension of those relying on tourism for survival, as they fear the usual summer rush of April and May could get washed out like it did last year. A Basheer Ahmed, of Chennai Metro Travels and national committee member of Travel Agents Federation of India, said at least three groups of families scheduled to travel to Dubai, Mauritius and Maldives have put off their trips. “They were supposed to travel on different dates in May. The cancellations have come at a time when we were pinning our hopes on April and May to see some income,” he said. Domestic tourist destinations, which were seeing better footfall due to international travel restrictions, are also beginning to see a lull.

Sources in the state police said, “The Union government has nominated three IPS officers including Shukla to take up the preparations for the FATF in connection with money laundering and terror funding cases.” Apart from Shukla, 41, Ananya Gautam, inspector general of police (ATS), Punjab, and Mukesh Singh, inspector general of police, Jammu, have also been nominated for the uphill task. “Shukla along with others will raise the issue of terror funding by the neighbouring country (Pakistan) which has already been in the grey list of the FATF. He will pursue the issue rigorously and represent India in this matter,” said an officer of Gujarat police. Shukla’s name was proposed by the Union government regarding which a proposal was sent to Gujarat DGP, Ashish Bhatia. On March 26, in a rare occurrence, Shukla was awarded the prestigious commendation disk of Indian Coast Guard at an event held at Gandhinagar for his relentless services and breakthroughs in curbing the menace of narcotics smugglers in the sea route. That award was given for his four major narcotics hauls in the sea route which included the biggest seizure of 100kg heroin. Shukla has shown relentless perseverance in eradicating organized crime and has earned himself the reputation of a master sleuth focused on weeding out terror from the state. A BTech degree holder from IIT Kharagpur, Shukla had secured 54th rank in the UPSC and could have become an IAS officer, but he chose to become a cop and solved tricky and complex cases including busting of the ISIS network in Bharuch, cracking the IISC Bengaluru terror attack case, arresting the accused involved in the attack on American consulate in Kolkata. He was instrumental ferreting out and arresting terrorists of Indian Mujaheedin involved in the bomb blasts executed in Ahmedabad on July 26, 2008.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ats-dig-shukla-to-present-indias-case-at-fatf/articleshow/82021540.cms||---

The camps will also focus on the availability of penal advocates at police stations in the districts. The high court’s directive came after an investigating officer of the Godhra police station told the court that he was not aware about any such list of empaneled advocates at his police station. The cop’s ignorance was exposed during the hearing of a Pocso case in which a 14-year-old has become pregnant. Legal proceedings were under way about the medical termination of her pregnancy. Upon coming to know about the officer’s ignorance about the provisions, the division bench said that the Supreme Court had issued various directions in this regard even before the Pocso Act came into force. The judge said that the district judge can hold legal camps and the superintendent of police should extend necessary cooperation for appraisal of investigating officers. This should be done, the court said: “…so that they could discharge their duties more efficiently and in accordance with the law of the country.” The court added: “The module could be worked out by the Director, Gujarat State Judicial Academy, for implementation in all the districts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/teach-cops-rights-of-rape-survivors/articleshow/82021549.cms||---

The current restrictions if managed well can help break the chain,” some of the team’s members told TOI. Officials from the administration familiar with the developments said the central team has recommended that the Pune Municipal Corporation, Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation and Pune rural authorities must have one control room to manage the current situation. Other suggestions said private practitioners should follow the AIIMS protocol of administration of drugs, especially remdesivir injections. They said the shortage could be due to rampant prescription.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/total-shutdown-in-pune-not-necessary-say-members/articleshow/82021543.cms||Nisha Nambiar

While the existing strength of the police band members against the sanctioned strength is only 33.8%, which will get reduced to zero in another two years as all of them are on the verge of retirement, the recruitment to this category has been frozen for almost 15 years now. The recruitment to the police band, which is a special category in the force because of which regular members of the force cannot be deputed, has been stuck for the want of special recruitment rules. According to sources in the police department, the recruitment was on a standstill since 2006, and the government in 2011, decided to hand over the recruitment to the Public Service Commission (PSC). The PSC then asked the government to frame the special rules for the recruitment, which has been stuck in the red tape since then. “The bands are an integral part of the uniformed forces all over the world. Unless the rules are framed and the recruitment is conducted by the PSC on a war footing, we will have a situation where we would not be left with bands even for the important state ceremonies like the Replublic Day or Independence Day,” ADGP (armed police battalion) K Padmakumar said. The police band is a separate category for which the recruitment is conducted on the basis of a different set of criteria unlike in the case of recruitment of regular policemen. The members recruited are not part of any other policing functions. After their recruitment, they are given training in basic policing for six months, after which they are trained in playing marching tunes for the force. At present, there are nine bands in the state — one each in Malabar special police, special armed police, all the five battalions of Kerala armed police, rapid response and rescue force and the armed reserve, Thiruvananthapuram. Though the sanctioned strength of police bands in eight units (except district AR, Thiruvananthapuram) is 245, the existing strength is only 83. Even though every band team is supposed to have 22 members, none of them has the required number, and two of them have only six members each, though the sanctioned strength in those units are 35 each.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/police-band-may-end-on-a-sad-note/articleshow/82020735.cms||KP Saikiran

The commission has registered the case following reports that the suicide of Thrissur native K S Swapna, who was the manager of the Thokkilangadi branch of Canara Bank, was due to work-related mental stress. Her suicide note said that she was taking the extreme step as she was unable to bear the pressure of work. Commission member K Byjunath has directed the Canara Bank chief general manager (Thiruvananthapuram) as well as Canara Bank regional manager to submit reports on the circumstances that led to the suicide of the official. The state level bankers committee (SLBC) has also been asked to conduct a study on the alleged pressure being faced by the staff of banks in the state, and submit a report within four weeks. The commission pointed out that A J Antony, a lawyer at Kalpetta, had submitted petition with the SHRC about banks exerting extreme pressure on employees. “He had raised the complaint that banks were reaping profits after large scale retrenchment of staff and exerting pressure on the remaining employees,” the commission said in a press release. It noted that a bank employee had committed suicide at Guruvayur three months ago and a similar incident had taken place in Palakkad eight months ago. There have been complaints that banks are pressurizing employees to meet the targets regarding deposits, loans, insurance, medical insurance mutual funds, fast tag, etc. Swapna was found to have committed suicide by hanging inside the bank building on Friday morning.

The petition, which was started a couple of weeks ago, has over 10,000 signatures. It pointed out the students are under tremendous pressure as they are forced to prepare for exams without proper guidance and syllabus completion. “It is unfair to expect students to attend the exams without properly knowing what they will be facing. We as students can say that it has been difficult to grasp concepts through online classes and lack of personal coaching all year long. Students will fail to give their best without classroom sessions and proper guidance. It is unfair for the educational boards to conduct exams and expect students to put their best foot forward.,” read the petition, started by an individual named Koumudi Balla. The petition pointed out that postponing the exams will hamper the natural flow of the academic year and put unnecessary pressure on students, who are already stressed out due to the pandemic, and added that cancellation of examinations will be the best solution. It also added that most schools and colleges have failed to complete even 50% of the entire syllabus meant for the academic year of 2020-2021 via online classes. “Keeping in mind the amount of stress each student is going through, we urge the state to cancel the examinations,” the petition added. The intermediate public examinations are scheduled to begin from May 1 and SSC exams will be held from May 17. While about 9.5 lakh students appear for inter first and second year exams every year, about 5 lakh students appear for SSC examinations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/under-pressure-students-demand-boards-cancellation/articleshow/82021557.cms||---

The depot coming up on a 48,000sqm plot is in addition to the existing one at Koyambedu and was supposed to be completed by December 2020. Work on the depot began along with work on the 9km phase-1 extension line from Washermenpet to Wimco Nagar. Like the extension line, construction of the depot was delayed due to the pandemic-induced lockdown last year. The line was opened, with seven instead of eight stations, on February 14. Of the 48,000sqm plot, the depot will be built on 15,500sqm and will have a 1,055sqm auto coach washing plant with three levels for property development. A small station will be attached to the depot for both depot staff and people using the property, with training and rest area for depot staff. The depot will have 11 stabling units for daily maintenance and minor repair work of trains operated on the 32.1km corridor from Wimco Nagar to Airport via Anna Salai. “70% of both civil and system works have been completed. The rest of the work is expected to be completed by August,” a Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) official said. At present, CMRL uses the Koyambedu depot to service its fleet of 52 trains, including the 10 new trains procured for the 9km extension line. “Wimco Nagar depot will handle only minor repair and daily and weekly maintenance work. Major repair and overhaul will still be done at our Koyambedu depot,” an official said. The plan for the rest of the plot, eventually, is to build a four-level car park below the elevated depot and develop 20 storeys above the depot to have commercial or residential spaces that can accommodate 4,000 families. The apartments will have sea view as the facility is a mere 600m away from the beach. Last year, a tender was floated to manufacture and install spares and consumables needed in the depots, such as automatic train wash plant, car body stand, retractable overhead equipment (OHE) and self-propelled battery operated scissor lift.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/citys-2nd-metro-rail-depot-to-be-ready-in-4-months/articleshow/82021555.cms||---

We will hold a review meeting on Monday,” said Prof Jasbinder Kaur, director-principal, GMCH. After four health workers, including technical staff and doctors, had tested positive for Covid on February 26, GMCH had suspended the OPD of the ENT department. Also, all elective surgeries had been cancelled. GMCH doctors decided they would see patients physically using online appointments. Patients are being offered consultation on telemedicine and eSanjeevani and would be seen in-person only if required. PGI was the first to announce suspension of physical OPDs from Monday owing to the surge in Covid-19 cases. “There are some online numbers given by PGI for consultation which seldom work or are attended to. In fact, it gets so tough to access doctors in case of non-Covid issues,” said a patient who belongs to Ludhiana. Most of the doctors in PGI feel as GMCH and GMSH are not referral tertiary care centres, it will be inconvenient for patients to get themselves treated. “There are rural areas where most do not know or have access to Internet. These online services are suitable for cities only,” said a faculty in GMSH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/gmch-limits-elective-surgeries/articleshow/82020746.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Officials from the Food and Drug Administration said on Sunday the objective of the emergency line is to boost supply to hospitals and stop hoarding. “If a patient/relative calls the helpline, he or she will be advised to ask the treating hospital to approach the helpline and register their complaint of non-availability of the drug. We will then ask the distributor/stockist to help out the hospital with vials,” said D S Khivansara, assistant commissioner, FDA, Pune branch. Hospitals treating Covid, including the facilities that don’t have an in-house medical store, will have to mail their requirement of the drug to stockists every day. Similarly, stockists/distributors will have to update the control room and FDA officials every day on the number of vials they have received and distributed to the hospitals. “If hospitals face any difficulty in the procurement of vials, despite furnishing daily requirement, then they can contact the helpline and register their complaint of non-availability. The control room will then contact the distributor and get the vials delivered to the hospitals. But hospitals cannot ask for more than their daily requirement,” Khivansara said. Hospitals will also have to keep a record of vials received and used every day. “They also have to maintain the RT-PCR report, chest CT reports and oxygen saturation levels of patients who have been given the drug,” Khivansara added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/control-room-set-up-to-improve-remdesivir-supply-stop-hoarding/articleshow/82021552.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Public health and engineering department (PHED) had laid water pipelines in Brahmapuri, Hawa Mahal zone, Chandi ki Taksaal, Kanwar Nagar, Joshi Colony and other areas. The roads were damaged and now even after five months the condition is still the same. Ashish Shukla, a resident of Hawa Mahal zone, said that the entire lane of his area is dug up from both the sides. “For the last six months, the authorities have left the road as it is. No form of complaint can force the authorities to take up the matter to re-build the road,” said Shukla. Similar situation can be seen in Chandi ki Taksaal where recent rainfall clogged the entire area as big pit in between the roads during rainfall is dangerous for commuters. Rajat Bishnoi, councillor of Ward 9, said that the situation is really bad in the Walled City. “I have been receiving many complaints from the residents to repair the road. The officials of PHED just dug up the roads and now it is the responsibility of Jaipur Municipal Corporation, Heritage to take care of the civic issues but cash-crunched corporation is not much of a use.” Similar concerns were shown by Surendra Singh, former councillor of Hawa Mahal, said that there is an urgent need to complete the road construction work in the Walled City as the Heritage look has no meaning without it. In the budget session of JMC, Heritage, it has been proposed to construct roads in the city and even the Rs 500 crore loan sanctioned by HUDCO, heritage mayor Munesh Gurjar has kept more than Rs 100 crore for the construction of broken lanes in the interior areas. However, the work will take time to begin but people are expecting to complete the road before monsoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/roads-dug-up-for-water-pipelines-yet-to-be-repaired/articleshow/82020745.cms||---
---||Lucknow||3 days on, BJP pulls Senger’s wife out of UP election fray||LUCKNOW: BJP on Sunday revoked the candidature of Sangeeta Senger, wife of expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Senger, for the forthcoming panchayat elections in Uttar Pradesh. Kuldeep Senger was convicted of raping a minor in Unnao one and half years ago. The development came three days after Sangeeta’s name was announced as BJP’s official candidate to contest the zila panchayat polls from Unnao. Although panchayat elections are not held on party symbols, BJP released the list of its official candidates for the first time. Announcing the decision, UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh said the district unit had been asked to send a panel of three names to the state headquarters soon. Unnao goes to polls in the third phase on April 26. The nomination process will be held from April 13-15. Sangeeta was given a ticket from Fatehpur Chaurasi ward-3 in Unnao. She had won the zila panchayat chairperson polls in 2016 as well. While Singh did not specify the reason behind the decision, sources said the party was averse to inviting criticism from the opposition over fielding of a candidate whose husband had a tainted background as it could dent the party’s prospects in the rural local bodies’ elections. Party sources said Sangeeta was made the candidate given the influence her family wields in Unnao. Her candidature was approved by a state-level committee headed by Singh and the party’s state general secretary Sunil Bansal. Party sources indicated that even after his conviction in the rape case, Senger has found support among BJP ranks and file. Unnao MP Sakshi Maharaj had visited Senger in jail to thank him after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Senger, who has been sentenced to life imprisonment, was disqualified as the member of the Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly last year in February. His brother Atul Senger is facing charges of beating the victim’s father who later died in police custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/3-days-on-bjp-pulls-sengers-wife-out-of-up-election-fray/articleshow/82023246.cms||---

Nine areas each from slums, rural areas and urban sectors, with a sample size of 2,700, are listed in the plan that premier medical institute PGI will submit to the UT administration for approval. “The aim will be to find which are the infected areas and in which pockets there are chances of the spread,” said a doctor. “This will enable epidemiologists to monitor and control areas from getting high rates of infection,” the doctor added. A serological survey is done by detecting the presence of specific antibodies that are produced against the virus. It is based on IgG Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (Elisa), a blood-based test, to estimate the proportion of population exposed to the infection. A hypothesis prevails that rural areas and slums were mostly affected in the first wave. A probability exists that the infection will be more rapid in urban sectors not exposed earlier. “The serological survey will help us to get such evidence, so that our tracking and testing can be enhanced accordingly,” said a public health expert. On July 29 last year, the administration had asked the PGI to conduct the survey. But nothing happened. In the absence of grants required for manpower and other logistics, such projects are not feasible, said a public health expert. Death toll mounts to 399 The city has reported 3,487 cases since April 1. The confirmed cases are 30,743, including 3,307 active cases. From the start of the month, 19 deaths have taken place. One of the three who died on Sunday was a 46-year-old man from Kajheri having acute respiratory distress syndrome. The others were a 63-year-old man from Sector 41 having bronchitis and hypertension and a 73-year-old man from Sector 45 suffering from hypertension. A total of 357 patients were discharged, taking the recovery count to 27,037.

Following his meeting with Mamata Banerjee at Nabanna last month, Yadav had spelled out RJD’s first priority of stopping any fascist forces from coming to power. He made it clear that his party’s stand was to “support Mamata ji”, while calling upon people from Bihar staying in Bengal to vote for TMC. RJD’s Rajya Sabha MP and national spokesperson Manoj Jha earlier stated that “it is likely Tejashwi will be campaigning in Bengal.” On Sunday, Jha did not answer to phone calls from TOI but he neither confirmed nor denied the messages sent to him. TMC sources said Yadav’s campaigning would “add firepower” to TMC’s campaign. According to sources close to some top RJD leaders, the 31-year old Yadav scion, who has already extended his party’s support to the TMC in Bengal by not fielding any candidates, has received feedbacks and requests from TMC candidates and leaders to campaign in some constituencies where the vote of people from Bihar will be crucial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tejashwi-may-return-to-join-tmc-campaign/articleshow/82021581.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Ahmedabad||No compensation for childbirth after ligation||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission has rejected a complaint filed by a woman seeking compensation for unwanted childbirth after tubal ligation surgery. The compensation was denied on the ground that the woman had an option to abort the fetus, but she did not do it. The case involved Rachnaben Jain from Odhav, who had undergone tubal ligation surgery for prevention of childbirth in June 2009 at Ashirvad Hospital of Dr Priya Patel. In January 2010, the woman came to know that she was pregnant and visited the doctor again for medical advice, and delivered a child in June 2010. In 2011, Jain sued the doctor with the commission for Rs 50lakh compensation alleging medical negligence for which she had to give birth to an unwanted child, whose expenditure she claimed until he turned major. In defence, Dr Patel submitted that the woman was advised for medical termination of pregnancy and offered free treatment, but her relatives had asked for money. The woman did not turn up for abortion as advised. She had even received Rs 30,000 under the Family Planning Programme. It was also submitted that tubal ligation operation does not guarantee permanent sterilization and failure can occur without negligence. After hearing the case, the commission said, “If she(complainant) had not chosen to do so (abortion), she has to bear the consequences. The amount of compensation asked by the complainant can be said to be a remote damage which cannot be permitted under the law. Therefore, the birth of child has chosen by the complainant herself. The amount narrated in the complaint for food, clothing, education and other miscellaneous expenses,and mental emotional distress, medical expenses, loss of enjoyment of life suffered by the complainant can be said to be remote damages.” The commission also said, “It is not feasible to attribute negligence / deficiency to the doctors; it is difficult to conclusively establish medical negligence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-compensation-for-childbirth-after-ligation/articleshow/82021573.cms||---

Across the state, police have registered 6,478 cases regarding mask violations from April 5 to April 11. As per the data available with Telangana police, a total of 2,030 cases were registered by Hyderabad police from April 5 to April 11. Hyderabad, was followed by Ramagudam police, with 938 cases booked against violators. In all the three police commissionerates — Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda — in city, a total of 3,214 cases were booked by police in the last one week. However, in Narayanpet, no case was registered, whereas in Wanaparthy, Bhupalapally and Jagtial, only one case each was registered by police. In the last six months, Telangana police had virtually stopped booking cases against those who were not wearing mask in public places. It was only after the second wave of Covid-19 began and intensified, that the state government directed officials to crack down on violators. DGP M Mahendar Reddy held a review meeting two days ago with all the unit heads, directing them to intensify the enforcement. As of now, police are booking cases either by nabbing the violator on the spot or identifying motorists who are not wearing mask, through CCTVs. Police started nabbing violators on the spot on Sunday and it is expected that the practice will be intensified. Cases which are registered on the spot are booked under Disaster Management Act and the violators are being asked to report themselves at the court. Meanwhile, as policemen are the frontline workers, they were asked to be cautious by their unit heads by taking precautions. “Apart from advising our policemen to mandatorily use mask and frequently sanitise their hands, our receptionists in police stations, who will be the first point of contact, will have a transparent shield at their desk and the communication will be done from a distance. Close gatherings of people at police stations are not allowed,” Cyberabad police commissioner VC Sajjanar told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/6k-cases-of-mask-violations-registered-in-t-last-week/articleshow/82021569.cms||---

On April 11 alone, 10 patients were declared brought dead, the report, which sought to explain the high number of Covid deaths at the hospital, said. In just the last 14 days, the SGH has had nearly 370 deaths. Muralidhar Tambe, dean of the BJ Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital said, “There are various reasons why the number of deaths may seem high at SGH. Patients who are very critical are generally brought here by relatives. Many private hospitals also send us their seriously ill patients. We have even seen patients already intubated being transferred to SGH, which should not be done in any case. Low oxygen saturation and an overall dearth in beds are key reasons why deaths have been high here.” Tambe said at least 77% of SGH’s admissions are seriously ill referrals from other hospitals. “We have very little chance of saving them,” he said. Over the past 30 days, more than 70 patients have died within 24 hours of admission, he added. “The SGH has been a Covid-only hospital since last year. The number of Covid patients here has always been high,” Tambe said. Data shows that over the past one year, the hospital has admitted over 7,000 Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/out-of-370-covid-deaths-at-sassoon-in-14-days-over-100-were-brought-dead/articleshow/82021560.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Nagpur||Hospitals stop admissions due to Remdesivir, oxygen crisis||Nagpur: Many hospitals have stopped taking new admissions despite some beds falling vacant because they are unable to get adequate supply of oxygen and Remdesivir injections. The city had started facing shortage of beds in March-end because of the surge in Covid cases and more number of patients requiring hospitalization. Though the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) increased the number of Covid hospitals to more than 100, citizens continue to get refusal for admissions. On Sunday, the city’s bed vacancy stood at a paltry 70 with just 45 oxygenated beds in government and 21 at private hospitals, besides two intensive care unit (ICU) beds each in both. Though the figures indicate some vacancies, the ground reality doesn't match the data. All helplines and officials said there was no bed available anywhere on Sunday. Citizens and activists searching for beds said they were told that the vacant beds were of no use and it was better to keep the patient at home. “Those who are able to get admitted are told to ensure that they would bring along the Remdesivir injection and also shift their patient in case they need oxygen, ICU or ventilator,” said an activist. An NGO volunteer said at least three private hospitals told the organization that they can’t admit patients because of lack of Remdesivir injections. “What treatment are we supposed to offer when these things are not available? This is the response from hospitals,” the volunteer said. The activist said some hospitals cried foul over being removed from the list to receive Remdesivir. Relatives of those waiting in home isolation also said they were waiting in long queues to get the drug yet the stock was getting exhausted frequently. Medical college officials said some private hospitals were also hosting mildly symptomatic patients even when an alarming situation has gripped the district. Meanwhile, mayor Dayashankar Tiwari asked municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B to start a 500-bed hospital in Mankapur sports stadium within the next seven days. He asked the civic chief to discuss with district collector Ravindra Thakare about the proposal and arrange the additional beds. He suggested that the NMC allocates Rs10crore from its budget and the standing committee makes a provision for it. NMC data as on Sunday, 7pm Vacant beds Total | 70 66 | O2 beds 4 | ICU beds 0 | Ventilators Breakup of above total O2 beds | 21 private, 45 govt ICU beds | 2 pvt, 2 govt Ventilators | 0 pvt, 0 govt Covid hospitals | 100 private, 10 govt, trust-run and NMC Other facilities Paid CCCs | 10 (8 hotels, one clinic, 1 hospital) Total | 45 beds||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hospitals-stop-admissions-due-to-remdesivir-oxygen-crisis/articleshow/82021588.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

When the pandemic broke out last February, the college of pharmacy attached to the Madras Medical College (MMC) developed an antiseptic solution for use by its students and staff. Back then, a 200-ml sanitiser bottle was sold at Rs 250 but the college was able to produce the same quantity for Rs 80. They produced at least 800 litres of hand-rubs daily which was made available in all classrooms, hallways, restrooms and canteen. Later, they started using it in the hospital wards. The in-house sanitizer not only helped RGGGH in infection control, but saved roughly Rs 30 lakh in expenses in the past one year. So, the state government wanted RGGGH to help other interested state agencies too to adopt this DIY strategy. A team from the college has started training select government employees and police (with scientific knowledge) to prepare the sanitizers using its formulation, said a RGGGH doctor, requesting anonymity. “Initially, many found it difficult to get the proportions right. So they were allowed to prepare the rubs under our supervision. Once they got the hang of it, they did it on their own,” he added. All the samples are sent to government labs for testing before use. S Prabhakar, an armed reserve police constable with a B Pharm degree involved in the process, said though making sanitizers isn’t too complex, the department did not want to take chances as even a small error can be disastrous. “So we underwent training and made ourselves familiar with the chemicals. It took multiple tries but the professionals from the college walked us through each step," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/govt-hosp-teaches-cops-to-make-own-safe-hand-sanitisers/articleshow/82021572.cms||---

There had been a lot of complaints to replace the water pipelines that are in a dilapidated condition due to which leakage is a big issue. Almost every day, water pipelines are damaged and roads get clogged.Manish Beniwal, additional chief engineer of PHED, said, “We are almost done with 90% of the work, but due to Covid and road cutting permission, the work got delayed. Moreover, the cost has now increased by 20% due to unavoidable circumstances for which we have to write to the finance department to get sanction. Once our sanction is approved, we will finish the work within one month.”The PHED has to bear an extra expense of around around Rs 7.4 crore for which sanction has to be given by the state government. The diameter of the new pipeline will be 100mm to 300mm. In this project, the central government, state government and municipal corporation had to give equal share, although nothing was received by the municipal corporation.The old pipelines in the Walled City were laid down decades ago that were made of cement, due to which complaints of leakage were common. Once the work is over, residents of Walled City will get some relief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2-years-on-old-pipeline-in-walled-city-yet-to-be-changed/articleshow/82020750.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Govt agrees to BJP’s demands, priest’s body cremated||JAIPUR: BJP state president Satish Poonia has called off the protest led by Rajya Sabha MP Kirori Lal Meena with the body of a priest on the fourth day in Jaipur following the state government agreeing to most of the demands on Sunday. The priest Shambhu Sharma who died on March 2 has become a source of protest for the BJP taking him as an example of the deteriorating law and order situation in the state. Meena released the body for cremation after the government agreed to seize the shops allegedly built on the temple land. Also, the government has ordered a high-level inquiry to be completed on or before April 30. Poonia, who joined the protest earlier in the day and held a protest march, has called it a victory of the BJP. The high-level meeting was attended by the chief secretary Niranjan Arya, home secretary Abhay Kumar, DGP M L Lathar, IG Jaipur Hawa Singh Ghumaria and Jaipur police commissioner Anand Srivastava, Jaipur MP Ramcharan Bohra, RS MP Meena, former state president Arun Chaturvedi, Sanganer MLA Ashok Lahoty and BJP leader Laxmikant Bhardwaj. Parallel to the meeting, Poonia held a protest march from Civil Lines Phatak to BJP headquarters against the alleged injustice against the priest. Poonia said it is unfortunate that the government always run away from taking responsibility for anything. “The law and order situation has deteriorated in the state and the way Shambhu Sharma’s case has been treated, shows the intent and grip of the government on the state affairs,” Poonia said. “Over 18,000 bighas of temple land has been encroached by land sharks. The government not taking these issues seriously shows they are not concerned about law and order. Soon after the agreement with the government, Bhardwaj took the body to Teekhri Jafran and cremated it in the presence of villagers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-agrees-to-bjps-demands-priests-body-cremated/articleshow/82020763.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: With no takers, farmers move away from winter veggies in Idukki district||IDUKKI: As the state government agency failed to provide timely payments, farmers in the winter vegetable cultivation hub of Kanthalloor in the district have been forced to move to planting eucalyptus trees. According to the farmers, Horticorp, the government agency, did not procure vegetables in time and assure proper payments. Kanthalloor winter vegetable farmers’ society secretary Sojan P G said that Horticorp failed to provide Rs 11 lakh to the society during 2017-19. “The society paid the farmers from its own funds. But Horticorp didn’t reimburse the society. Now, the society has no money to procure vegetables. In the absence of proper procurement, many farmers decided to avoid vegetable farming and started planting eucalyptus trees,” said Sojan. A total of 701 farmers were engaged in winter vegetable farming in Kanthalloor region, he said. “In the lockdown period, many farmers cultivated more areas of vegetables but they didn’t get proper market and prices. This season, many farmers stopped farming vegetables,” he added. “Earlier, many planted eucalyptus trees on their lands. Last year, many removed the trees and began vegetable farming there. But due to the absence of proper income from vegetable farming many decided to grow eucalyptus trees,” Sojan said. According to farmers, agriculture minister V S Sunilkumar made announcements that the total quantity of vegetables would be procured and payments would be made on time. But nothing happened, said a farmer. Horticorp district manager George Michael said that there was a due of payment to the society in Kanthalloor. “There are some discrepancies in the amount, which caused the delay. We will make the payments soon through the principal agricultural office,” he said. Idukki principal agricultural officer V T Sulochana said, “We haven’t received any complaint about payment dues. We paid Rs 1 crore 5 lakh to 4,000 farmers, last year. If we get a complaint, we will take steps to make payments immediately.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/with-no-takers-farmers-move-away-from-winter-veggies/articleshow/82020766.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Madurai||Cases in bulk prompt Trichy flat owners to impose SOPs||Trichy: After an apartment in Srirangam reported 13 Covid positive cases last week, the apartments and gated communities in the city have volunteered to enforce standard operating procedures (SOPs) such as entry restrictions. Addictionally, Trichy corporation sanitary officials have sensitised the representatives of apartment residents welfare associations (RWA) that bulk positive cases will attract a containment zone.Since the apartments have common access areas including lifts, staircase and parking lot, the vulnerability of spread within the community is high. An apartment in Veereswaram reported bulk positive cases, where the infection first reported in a family quickly spread to a neighbouring family due to the lapses in self-isolation. The incident made other gated communities self-impose certain restrictions for the residents. While vendors selling essential commodities like milk and newspaper will be allowed to access the complex with precautions, the delivery personnel from courier operators and food delivery companies will be denied entry. “Securities guarding the main entrance gates were told to check body temperatures of visitors,” said V Nadaraja, an RWA representative, Cantonment. Trichy corporation has instructed the apartment residents to frequently sanitise the common access areas with effective disinfectants. A few apartments have also planned to vaccinate their residents by coordinating with the recognised private hospitals. The RWAs have been asked to keep a watch on the Covid positive persons. Waste generated by the isolated residents will be collected separately. “If an apartment reports more than 3 positive cases, we will partially block the entry. Following commercial establishments, we are keeping a watch in the apartments as the density of population is high,” S Sivasubramanian, commissioner, Trichy corporation told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cases-in-bulk-prompt-trichy-flat-owners-to-impose-sops/articleshow/82021597.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Talk less, text more to beat corona, says CCMB||HYDERABAD: People should avoid verbal communication and prefer texting in offices, even if they sit together. City-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) has come out with an advisory to beat the coronavirus in offices and homes, as cases increase all over the country. CCMB scientists have advised that in case of a positive Covid-19 case under home quarantine, family members should wear masks, if they were sitting together in a hall at home. The advisory, issued after an aero-surveillance study in a hospital set-up, said the recommendations were based on recent studies, including CCMB’s observations. “Non-verbal communication by texting/emailing should be encouraged among office staff even if they are sitting next to each other in the same room. Further, they should be encouraged to have indirect forms of verbal communication through personal mobiles/telephones instead of direct face-to-face interactions,” CCMB said in the advisory. Stating that social distancing is a must, the advisory said a distance of at least three feet, if not six feet, should be maintained. “The virus can stay longer in the air in closed rooms, which are not properly ventilated. Spending more time in closed spaces can, therefore, be risky even if social distancing is maintained,” it said. It said the spread of the pandemic, to a large extent, could be attributed to people having unprotected verbal interaction in close quarters with asymptomatic Covid-19 positive individuals. Wearing masks significantly decreases the viral load released by a Covid positive individual. If both the affected person and unaffected person wear masks, the risk of transmission of the virus becomes very low. “In a family, if a person is detected Covid-19 positive and advised by the doctor to be home quarantined…all members in the house should preferably always wear masks. It is better to avoid going to others’ homes. The risk of contracting the disease in home environments is likely to be higher,” the advisory added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-19-office-etiquette-junk-verbal-start-texting/articleshow/82021583.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Pune||Holiday, weekend curfew hit vaccination coverage||Pune: The weekend curfew, coupled with a vaccine holiday at some sites, brought down overall vaccinations on Sunday. Compared to Saturday, coverage on Sunday fell by nearly 40%. Only 45,331 beneficiaries were vaccinated in the district on Sunday, compared to the 79,220 on Saturday. Pune rural clocked the highest vaccination numbers at 22,418. It was followed by the PMC areas (11,485) and the PCMC (at 11,428). According to the District Health Office (DHO) report, only 381 sites were functional on Sunday, as against the 530 on Saturday. Officials from the health department said they were expecting numbers to go up on Sunday after the arrival of 1.1 lakh new Covishield doses the day before. PMC officials said coverage was low in the city areas because some centres were shut. “Many private hospital sites have holidays on Sundays. They don’t have enough staff to carry out weekend vaccinations too. This had an adverse impact on overall coverage,” a senior PMC official said. Jitendra Oswal, the deputy director of Bharati Hospital said they could not hold sessions because there were not enough doses available. “We will be resuming vaccinations on Monday,” Oswal said. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “A Sunday, along with the overall weekend curfew, could have caused turnouts to drop. But we’re sure coverage will again pick up on Monday.” Deshmukh said officials here are expecting more doses to arrive on Tuesday. “So there should not be any shortage across the district,” he said. When asked about the health department’s plan to keep up coverage if curbs expand, Deshmukh said officials are working on a new strategy. He also said the region will once again attempt to reach one lakh daily vaccinations on Monday. “We reached 85,000 daily beneficiaries once before. So with enough preparations, we will be able to achieve the target of one lakh daily vaccinations,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/holiday-weekend-curfew-hit-vaccination-coverage/articleshow/82021594.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Delhi||India-first rule on vax: Chadha to PM||New Delhi: In a letter to the Prime Minister, Aam Aadmi Party MLA Raghav Chadha has said that vaccines against Covid-19 should have a strict India-first rule, with Indian citizens’ needs given priority over exports to other countries. Writing as a “representative of Young India” and a Delhi MLA, Chadha said the Government of India is prioritising the international community over Indian citizens in the matter of providing vaccines. He alleged that the Centre has been exporting over 64 million doses to 84 countries but neglected the fundamental rights of its citizens to basic healthcare and protection by vaccination. “As you are doubtless aware, our country is facing an acute shortage of vaccine doses with thousands of centres across the country being shut for want of doses. Several states have run out of stocks of vaccines and remaining states have stocks left only for three to five days,” Chadha said in his letter. “While we do not begrudge other countries’ humanitarian aid, the same cannot be at the cost of Indian citizens, particularly young India, which has been waiting for its turn ever since the vaccine became available,’ he has written, urging the Centre to adopt ‘Vaccine Nationalism’. He has written that the Centre should also keep in mind “vaccine universalisation” and not regard youngsters as “expendable collateral damage in government’s diplomatic moves”. Reacting to Chadha’s letter, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that the letter is not motivated by nationalism or serious concern for the youth but is part of a political game to create confusion and make the vaccination process controversial. He said the Centre is seriously committed to speedy vaccination for all and taking steps like prohibiting Covid medicine export as it has on Sunday banned export of Remdesivir injections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/india-first-rule-on-vax-chadha-to-pm/articleshow/82021607.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Though most of the sewerage network lines have been laid, the land to construct the plant itself has not been identified, following opposition from locals to the sites shortlisted earlier. The work order for the 20MLD STP was issued to Hyderabad-based Ayyappa Infra Pojects in December 2016. The work for the entire design, construction, installation and maintenance of the plant was allotted at a cost of Rs 54 crore and April 2018 was the stipulated date for its completion. However, consecutive sites shortlisted to set up the STP faced opposition from locals of the area concerned, fearing that they may have to bear the stench emanating from such a plant. Sewerage and Infrastructural Development Corporation of Goa Ltd (SIDCGL) said that the SBR technology used has been proven to be odourless and is being used world over. “The work of construction of STP could not be started due to objections from locals and revocation of the NOCs issued,” said officials. Presently, two sites at Socorro are under consideration for the plant. “The two options are near KTCL Depot area and other near Tisk in Socorro. The case is being examined for transfer and procurement of land,” officials said. Once work on the plant begins, it will be ready for use within 12 months as most of the pipeline network has already been laid, said officials. As part of phase I, a pipeline network of 43km has been laid. The first phase covers the Porvorim plateau. Phase II will cover other areas like Socorro, Salvador do Mundo, Pilerne and Pomburpa. Around 8,000sqm of land is required for the plant. Porvorim is turning out to be one of the most congested residential and commercial areas and treating sewage in such areas prevents the groundwater from getting contaminated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sewer-lines-laid-but-porvorim-stp-work-yet-to-begin/articleshow/82022313.cms||---

He said, “The other children sustained minor injuries and were discharged after treatment. An elderly woman had a narrow escape as she was sleeping outside.” Bawa said the deputy commissioner (DC) has sought a report and action would be taken after the cause of collapse was known. A rescue team reached the spot but neighbours had till then evacuated the trapped family members from the debris and shifted them to a hospital.

Besides, the department plans to get drivers through a centralised system from private players to ensure that the buses keep operating despite the pandemic. On an average, at least two buses are declared unfit on a daily basis, officials claimed. "We are planning on adding more buses to the fleet as everyday a couple of them are declared as unfit for plying. We will float a tender soon and I have also asked the depots across the state to give details of their requirements. Previously, the department had purchased 2x2 express buses but if a passenger wants to travel in Volvo or other buses then we should make them available. There is a requirement for various categories of buses," said Rajeshwar Singh, CMD, Rajasthan Roadways. Apart from this, the department will also recruit more drivers. "We can have drivers in the 70:30% ratio and trained drivers can be recruited from private companies. Earlier, we had recruited conductors when there was a shortage to ensure that even during the pandemic, the buses continue to ply with all necessary precautions." On a positive note, the roadways revenue touched the pre-covid days as Rs 141 crore was collected in March with the buses travelling 3.8km on a daily basis ferrying over 2 crore passengers. However, with the number of Covid patients increasing in the state officials feel the footfall may decline in the coming months. They stated that the revenue from interstate buses might decrease slightly as states like Uttarakhand and Gujarat have made Covid negative test mandatory due to which commuters are posponing travel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/roadways-to-add-550-buses-to-its-fleet/articleshow/82020767.cms||---

According to the district health department records, Ranchi district has now 2,352 beds of which 1,227 are earmarked for asymptomatic patients, 761 are with oxygen support, 364 ICU beds and 184 with ventilator support. Of the total beds, 1,124 are occupied and 1,067 are vacant as of Sunday afternoon. Among the vacant beds, 117 are oxygen supported while 44 are in ICUs and 80 are equipped with ventilators. The district administration is also working on a plan to further increase the beds considering the acute surge in cases. Officials said they are planning to increase the capacity at the Ranchi district hospital, Rims and other state-run healthcare facilities by next week. Talking to TOI on the matter, Ranchi DC Chhavi Ranjan said, “Currently, Rims has 312 beds and 240 at the sadar hospital and we are making arrangements to at least increase the number of beds to 500 and 450 respectively at these two centres. We have already started work on converting 200 isolation beds at the Khelgaon centre into oxygen supported beds to treat symptomatic patients.” He further said a few private hospitals have increased their number of beds by reserving 25% of the total beds as directed by health minister Banna Gupta last week. "The rest would follow soon," Ranjan said, adding, “If they do not follow the directive, I will be forced to acquire the hospitals by enforcing the Disaster Management Act.” To ensure judicious use of beds at the CCCs, the district administration plans to screen positive patients arriving at the centres to decide whether they need home isolation or institutional treatment so that critical patients can get the beds. Ranjan added, "I have received information that many asymptomatic patients, as well as those who were advised home isolation, are making a beeline to get oxygen-supported beds. In this regard, I have asked the sadar hospital to screen the condition of the patients to judiciously assign the beds.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/no-of-cov-beds-crosses-2k-in-ranchi-after-admin-push/articleshow/82020741.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||Maoists call Bharat bandh on Apr 26 to protest death of cadres in C’garh, Bihar||Ranchi: The Eastern Regional Buro (ERB) of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) has called for a Bharat bandh on April 26 against the killing of their cadres by security forces in Chhattisgarh and Bihar during “Operation Prahar” and appealed to the masses for support. In a press communiqué issued by Sanket, the spokesperson of the ERB, the banned organisation has detailed the reasons for calling the bandh in the backdrop of statements issued by Union home minister Amit Shah after the Chhattisgarh gunbattle. Blaming the RSS-supported BJP government at the Centre for pushing the commoners to a “war-like situation” and targetting "sons of the soil", Sanket said "Operation Prahar", planned by the Centre, is not going to be successful as the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist cadres are ready. "There's formidable power in human capital and the masses. When they stand together for a cause, they are sure to win. This oneness is strengthened by Amit Shah's statement that Operation Prahar will continue unless all Maoists are destroyed. We challenge that his dreams will never come true," the statement read. "We want to open a new channel of development which will not speak of destruction and focus only on creativity," it added. Extending salute to the four cadres of Chhattisgarh-based People's Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA), the armed group of Maoists, -- Odi Sunny, Padam Lakhma, Kovasi Badru and Nupa Suresh — who were killed in the fight with security forces in Bijapur and Sukma districts of Chhattisgarh on April 3, the ERB blamed the Centre for the bloodbath. "More than 2,000 security men had lodged an attack on our PLGA in Jiragurem village, which was retaliated and 24 security men were killed, 31 were injured and one was captured unhurt. This was one among the series of attacks that we have been facing for years," Sanket said. Criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government for imposing an unplanned lockdown during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic last year while "helping" big corporates to make huge profits, the ERB said, " Political parties in India have been protecting the interests of capitalists since Independence and the Modi government is no different. All its decisions have been in their favour which is evident from the rising fortunes of Adani and Ambani," the statement claimed. The ERB has also mentioned the names of four of its cadres in Bihar -- Amresh Singh Bhogta, Uday Paswan, Sita Bhuiyan and Shiv Pujan Yadav -- who were killed in the Gaya district of Bihar on March 16 by security forces and said that its PLGA in Chhattisgarh has avenged them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/maoists-call-bharat-bandh-on-apr-26-to-protest-death-of-cadres-in-cgarh-bihar/articleshow/82020690.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||Banna criticises PM’s call to celebrate 4-day Tika Utsav||Ranchi/Hazaribag: State health minister Banna Gupta on Sunday took to twitter and criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi over Tika Utsav, the four-day special vaccination programme. Gupta’s tweet came at a time when state gave a moderate response on vaccine coverage after a few districts had reported shortage of vaccine supply. “Respected Prime Minister, how can we celebrate misery? People are dying in hospitals, there is shortage of beds. States are ignored in vaccine supply and there is complete non-cooperation from the Centre. How can we celebrate anything amid death and mourning? So please stop politics over deaths and stop looking for opportunity in disaster,” Banna’s tweet attacking PM’s call for celebrating vaccination festival for four days read. Meanwhile, the minister also cancelled his election trip to Madhupur to return to the state capital to supervise things amid increasing Covid-19 cases. Talking to TOI, Banna said, “In view of increasing cases of Covid-19 in the state, it is my responsibility to monitor the situation and take necessary steps which can help in saving lives.” The vaccination coverage on Sunday reported good figures as authorities ensured vaccines are made available to panchayat levels and maximum number of beneficiaries are inoculated. As per health department records, a total of 80,517 people were administered their first shot of which only 496 were healthcare and frontline workers. Even as the coverage percentage remained around 58% of the target of 1,37,650, authorities were happy with the response. Meanwhile, in Hazaribag, people turned up in large numbers at vaccination centres after session sites were increased to a total of 113. The district authorities said that they have been provided with adequate vaccines and they had distributed 100 doses each at all the session sites. “We have set up 112 centres in the entire district in addition to the Main Vaccination centre at Hazaribag Medical College and Hospital,” said Dr Shyama Kant, in-charge of the vaccination drive in Hazaribag. On being asked whether there is any shortage of vaccine in the district, Dr Kant said, “As of now, we have sufficient doses. I appeal to all eligible beneficiaries to come and get inoculated as the vaccine is completely safe.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/banna-criticises-pms-call-to-celebrate-4-day-tika-utsav/articleshow/82020653.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||Bihar cops raid liquor godown in Bokaro||Bokaro: A joint team of Jamui (Bihar) police and the Bihar excise department with the support of the Bokaro administration raided a liquor manufacturing unit, Shree Om Bottlers and Blenders Private Limited, on Saturday night. The team seized more than 700 boxes of liquor bottles stocked in a godown located adjacent to the manufacturing unit. Although the liquor manufacturing unit is licensed, the godown adjacent to it where the liquor bottles were seized is unlicensed. The liquor factory belongs to businessman Anil Singh. Apart from liquor manufacturing, Singh has other business ventures. Singh did not respond when contacted. The SP of Jamui, Pramod Kumar Mandal, said over the phone: “The raid was conducted following the seizure of a huge stock of liquor bottles from a truck parked near a dhaba at Panaut Moad in Malaypur area of Jamui on April 9.” The truck’s driver said he loaded the liquor from Bokaro. Six people were arrested in Jamui. DSP Aditya Kumar, who was heading the raid team, said: “The bottles seized from the godown here and those recovered from the truck two days ago were of the same brand. The brand is an unlicensed one. Even the godown in which the stocks were kept is illegal as per the local excise department.” The subdivisional officer (SDO) of Chas, Shashi Prakash Singh, also visited the factory after receiving the information of the raid. The SDO said: “The local administration will also investigate whether the permits and license of the manufacturing unit and the brand being produced are valid or not.” The local excise department is also investigating to verify the status and ownership of the godown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bihar-cops-raid-liquor-godown-in-bokaro/articleshow/82020514.cms||Divy Khare
---||Ranchi||Bodies pile up at Ranchi crematorium||Ranchi: The burning ghat at Muktidham in Harmu on Sunday witnessed a long queue of bodies as one of the electric furnaces developed a snag. Therefore, people had to wait for long hours to perform the last rites of their relatives who died of Covid-19. Congress leader Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, who visited the venue to take part in a ritual, alleged the situation arose due to the insensitivity of the administration. He said, “The bodies of Covid victims are cremated in electric furnaces. With the number of deaths owing to Covid-19 rising sharply and one of the furnaces becoming inoperative, people are having to wait for hours to cremate their near ones.” “I arrived at Muktidham around 10:30am, but one of the electric pyres was out of order. Moreover, there was no effort to either fix it or set up an alternate arrangement,” the relative of a deceased Covid-19 patient said. With reports of accumulation of bodies at the ghat spreading, the district administration issued a directive to the Ranchi Municipal Corporation to repair the furnace as soon as possible. Deputy municipal commissioner Kunwar Singh Pahan said that an alternative arrangement to cremate Covid-19 bodies has been made at a ghat in Ghagra. However, cremation of bodies of Covid victims did not begin at the Ghagra crematorium till 9pm on Sunday. “One of the machines developed problems early in the morning, while the other was functioning at a slow speed,” Ranchi deputy mayor Sanjeev Vijaywargia said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bodies-pile-up-at-ranchi-crematorium/articleshow/82020574.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Surat||Fuel replaces ghee in Surat cremations as Covid deaths spike||SURAT: “I know that this is disrespectful but what shall we do? The pyre contains green wood and will not burn at all if we don’t use any inflammable. I brought diesel from a friend so that the pyre burns properly,” said Arjun Patel, a resident of Udhna, sprinkling some liquid he brought in a plastic container. His relatives had built the pyre at the open ground adjoining to Ramnath Ghela Crematorium (RGC).  “The wood has not dried completely and does not catch fire without the use of some inflammable,” he added. More so, RGC has itself arranged kerosene containers to be used in wooden pyre for speedy cremations. Cremation, where ghee along with sandalwood were some of the prerequisites for the last rites, have now shed their emotional quotient with the demand of the times. The use of inflammables like diesel and petrol in place of the traditional ghee is a grim reminder of the situation at the city’s crematoriums. “Due to high numbers it is difficult to cremate all bodies in a gas furnace in time. To avoid the delay the families have started cremation on wooden pyre but dry wood supply is also limited. Hence, we have arranged kerosene to burn the pyre properly,” said an official at RGC. At night, Sandip Jhagade arrived with a couple of bottles of petrol to help his friends cremate their relative. “It is the third cremation for which I came here in two days. The wood is green and will not burn properly if we don’t use inflammable,” said Jhagade, dispassionately dousing the pyre with petrol. At other crematoriums in the city too, dry wood soon ran out of stock in a week and are now getting more wooden lobs to complete the cremations quickly. After local authorities mounted pressure on crematoriums to clear the waiting, crematoriums are setting up additional infrastructure to clear backlog.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/fuel-replaces-ghee-in-surat-cremations-as-deaths-spike/articleshow/82020839.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

Members were also informed that the panchayat has made provisions for the ‘Calangute Going Green’ initiative, in which villagers are encouraged take up agricultural activities with free seeds, fertilizer and an assured buy-back of the produce. A new 4x4 tractor has also been purchased. Sarpanch Shawn Martins said the panchayat has made a provision for traffic and street marshals to manage traffic and spot touts, beggars and tourists cooking and eating in the open. Stating that the drive against beggars is ongoing, he said, “Just yesterday 15 beggars were rounded up by the police.” He also said that in keeping with the promise of the ruling panel, there will be no increase in taxes. All roads will be painted with white lines and speed breakers and solar blinkers will be installed, he assured. Responding to queries from gram sabha members, he said the panchayat has managed to improve the process of garbage collection. “While earlier we would send around 85% mixed garbage to the garbage treatment plant (GTP), now we send 100% segregated garbage,” he said. A villager informed the gram sabha that the garbage contractor is using some children to collect garbage. He asked the panchayat to take necessary action as it amounts to child labour. Another villager said the panchayat needs to be more proactive when there are clashes between locals and outsiders. Former sarpanch Anthony Menezes voiced his opposition to the construction of a new building for the Calangute police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/calangute-meet-approves-rs-10-crore-budget-provisions/articleshow/82022368.cms||---
---||Goa||Large forest patches being axed in Caranzol||Keri: Over the last few years, incidents of patches of forests being cleared have been on the rise within the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary limits in Caranzol, Sattari. As per the 1991 Census, out of its total area of over 4,000ha, 3,527ha forest cover was in Caranzol. When the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary was declared in 1999, most of Caranzol’s forest area was included within the sanctuary limits. However, till date, the government has not issued the final notification on the sanctuary. Due to this, interferences, encroachments have been continuously on the rise from some villagers and even government agencies. In September 2015, the Goa Forest Development Corporation had illegally initiated felling of trees and clearing of bushes at Patyar in Caranzol, on the left bank of the Mhadei. Eight trees were felled and bushes cleared in 2.5ha. In October 2019, a group of villagers from Caranzol took a decision not to allow any forest officials in their village and erected boards declaring ‘no entry for forest officials of Goa government’. Taking advantage of this , illegal felling of trees inside sanctuary areas has be on since. During the Covid-19 lockdown, in May 2020, large scale illegal tree felling followed by burning of forested area had come to light on the slope of the Huland hill in Caranzol. After the incident was reported by trekkers, range fForest officer Vilas Gawas took suspects Santosh Gawade and Nakul Naik into custody after investigation. Similarly, on February 19, 2021, five teak trees were felled and attempts were made to carry the logs out of the forests of Kazredhat using a rickshaw. Though the rickshaw involved was seized by the wildlife division, later on JMFC at Valpoi granted bail to the owner of the rickshaw and released the vehicle. In the latest case, on March 15, 2021, range forest officer of the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary, Narayan Prabhudesai, booked two offences against unknown persons involved in illegal cutting of trees and destruction of habitat by setting fire. However, so far no culprit has been arrested in the matter. Deputy conservator of forests of the wildlife division, Jebastin Arulraj, said, “We are making best efforts to curtail the incidents of increasing forest clearances in Caranzol by taking locals into confidence.” “After the felling of trees and clearing of forest, villagers have been involved in bringing the area under cashew plantation, thereby posing a threat to the natural forest cover as well as to the wildlife habitat,” said Vitthal Shelke, a wildlifer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/large-forest-patches-being-axed-in-caranzol/articleshow/81902910.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

The work has been taken up at a cost of Rs 60 lakh. The work was inaugurated by deputy speaker and Canacona MLA Isidore Fernandes. Cotigao sarpanch Umesh (Daya) Gaonkar said that in addition to this, construction of a protection wall near Gaondongrim’s Shri Mallikarjun temple has also been taken up at an estimated cost of Rs 13 lakh. Gaonkar also urged the MLA to get government approval for two more culverts at Kuskem and Avem, “which need attention on a priority”. The Cotigao sarpanch also put forth a proposal before Fernandes to get the government to sanction an irrigation project, a demand which has been pending for many years. Fernandes, meanwhile, assured the locals that as and when the government has sufficient funds in its coffers, these pending works would be taken up. Talpona locals, too, heaved a sigh of relief after their long-pending demand of a gutter and drainage was realized with the launch of the works Fernandes in the presence of Poinguinim sarpanch Jagdish Gaonkar. The demand for the drainage system was pending for several years and villagers had to deal with rain water gushing into their houses at Talpona, a local pancha Rudresh Namshikar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/12-years-after-canacona-flash-floods-culverts-to-be-rebuilt/articleshow/82022387.cms||---
---||India||Covid-19: Maharashtra administers over 1cr vaccine doses, highest in country||MUMBAI: Maharashtra reached a major Covid-19 milestone on Sunday as it crossed the one crore-mark in vaccine doses administered, the highest by any state. It took the state a little less than 70 days to cover nearly one-third of the target population with at least one dose, officials said. Rajasthan is a close second with nearly 96lakh doses administered. Calling it a big achievement amid a roaring pandemic, Maharashtra’s principal health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas said that around 86.3% of healthcare workers and 72.7% frontline workers have received at least the first dose of the vaccine. “About 19.7% of the population in the 45-plus age category has been covered so far,” he added. The state’s target population for the vaccine is an estimated three crore. As of Sunday noon, Maharashtra had administered 1,00,38,421 doses, including over 71lakh to those above 45 years, 15.52lakh health workers and 12.50lakh frontline workers. Of the one crore doses, 89.7lakh have been given the first dose and 9.5lakh both the doses, prompting experts to say that Maharashtra’s per lakh population coverage was lower than other states such as Rajasthan. The vaccination coverage that had hit a lull last week due to shortage of doses is likely to pick up from Monday. Dr Vyas said the state had about nine lakh doses on Sunday morning. “We are likely to get 14 lakh doses by Monday,” he said. From merely 18,338 vaccinations on the first day of the national drive on January 16, daily vaccinations soared to 4.6lakh on April 3. However, the momentum was badly hit last week by the vaccine shortage that pulled down daily coverage to 2.8lakh on Saturday and 2.7lakh on Friday. A state official said Maharashtra needs a steady supply of 40lakh doses every week to sustain the pace and augment daily vaccinations to six lakh. In Mumbai, civic officials said 62 of the 71 private vaccination centres will start vaccination on Monday. Vaccination at all private centres got stalled on Friday due to shortage of doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/maharashtra-administers-over-1cr-doses-highest-in-country/articleshow/82023252.cms||Sumitra Debroy

They are dispelling myths and fears about the drive to build immunity against Covid. With aggressive campaigning and mass mobilization, the district administration provided vaccines to almost 17,000 beneficiaries on Friday and to another 41,000 on Saturday. It’s learnt that several women self-help groups in the district, out of around 700-800 on record, have been approached and activated by the community resource persons (CRP), bank sakhi (bank volunteers) or krushi sakhi (agricultural volunteers) to create awareness about the vaccination drive in their villages through word of mouth to increase the footfalls. “The women of the bachat gat were told to ensure that not only their neighbours and friends but also those from their families should take the jab. If women motivate their families then that itself could increase the numbers,” said Zilla Parishad chief executive officer (CEO) Yogesh Kumbhejkar. Even teachers are going door to door to motivate people to join the vaccination drive. “We have embarked on a multi-prong strategy for creating motivation regarding the vaccine,’ he said. Around 2,000 gram rozgar sevaks or volunteers for employment generation at village levels too have been asked to approach labourers or past beneficiaries of the ‘National rural employment guarantee Act’ (NREGA) to motivate them for taking the jabs. District health officer (DHO) Dr Deepak Selokar said the sarpanch (village headman or headwoman) too have been roped in for the drive. “The sarpanchs were given the jabs ahead of the others in most villages. They were made role models for the others to follow. We have now requested the sarpanch to arrange for vehicles for ferrying beneficiaries to-and-from health centres,” he said. “We are relentlessly engaging in announcements on public address systems regarding the benefits and effectiveness of the vaccines. Multiple centres have been opened and made more accessible to the public,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/womens-self-help-groups-teachers-script-success-story-for-district-vaccine-drive/articleshow/82022383.cms||Soumitra Bose

Speaking on Sunday at Betul, Kavlekar said that he has discussed the issue with chief minister Pramod Sawant who has promised him that the government will follow up with the authorities to get the Betul satellite port project denotified. Kavlekar was speaking after unveiling the foundation stone for the retaining wall along River Sal. Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) had temporarily shelved the Betul port plan in 2017 due to protests. The final decision was taken in 2020 after discussions with the Union ministry of shipping and the state government, and after considering the adverse financial implications. After unveiling the plaque, Kavlekar said that he has taken up the matter about the port with Sawant, who has immediately asked the Captain of Ports to issue the necessary directions. “Only the notification remains and that will be followed up by me,” Kavlekar said. In June 2016, Union minister of shipping Nitin Gadkari had announced that a satellite port would come up about 35km from MPT and it would be jointly developed with the Goa government. The Centre wanted around 150-200 acre to develop the satellite port at Betul but the move was objected to by locals. The satellite port was being built to handle bauxite and other cargo. Water resources minister Felipe Neri Rodrigues, who was also present, said the wall is being built to stop the steady erosion of the banks of River Sal, which is posing danger to old houses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/betul-port-shelved-only-denotification-pending-kavlekar/articleshow/82022443.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Ornamental Janitor fish in Cansaulim pond raises concern||PANAJI: Fishing activity in a fresh water pond at Cuelim, Cansaulim, on Sunday yielded a large catch of Janitor fish, even as scientists raised a suspicion about an invasion of local water bodies by this ornamental variety, kept domestically in aquariums. A sizeable yield last month in a nearby pond comprised this dangerous carnivore - Pterygoplichthys or more popularly known as sucker fish. The locals are still baffled after finding this South American native about three to four years back and have not been able to find out who released the fish in ponds. “We had a good catch with a variety of fish - though local species such as pitoll and keri were absent - but sagor, as it is locally called - was a substantial part of the haul,” Honorato Saldanha, a villager said Goa’s water bodies are known to be already invaded by African catfish and Mozambique tilapia. While the population of local species of catfish and other fresh water species has decreased, the African native is another voracious carnivore that consumes smaller fish. Tilapia, though not a carnivore, but hardy like other invasive species is known to breed quickly and reduces the food for other local fish. The harvesting in Kanttea Tollem on Sunday was only a first round of fishing, as locals will wait for the water to dry up further. The fishermen will wait till May to cast their nets in another bigger water body, Pale lake, which may have a larger population of sucker fish. “The size of the sucker fish in Kanttea Tollem was even bigger than in the other pond,” Neville Saldanha, another villager said. Fisheries scientists of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) have collected samples of the sucker fish and are studying the dynamics of its entry in local ponds. The scientists were alerted after an animal rescuer, Johnson Stephen, posted photos on social media of the discarded sucker fish, which locals had dumped. The sucker fish has also created havoc in parts of Kerala. “It seems it was also found in some ponds of Baramati, Maharashtra. This raises a concern about the competition provided by invasive species to local commercially and ecologically important species. Therefore, a focussed study is the need of the hour to control the spread of this unwanted and dangerous species,” Baban Ingole, a well-known fisheries scientist, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ornamental-janitor-fish-in-cansaulim-pond-raises-concern/articleshow/82022492.cms||Paul Fernandes
---||Nagpur||‘Firefighters in Nagzira were without safety gear, first aid kit’||Nagpur: Even as chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has released Rs 1 lakh of the promised Rs 5 lakh to next of kin of each victim of Nagzira forest fire, three honorary wildlife wardens (HWLWs) from Gondia-Bhandara have demanded a transparent probe in the incident and strict action against those responsible. HWLWs Sawan Bahekar and Mukund Dhurve (Gondia) and Pervez Shahid Khan (Bhandara) in a memorandum to the chief minister and PCCF (wildlife) have reported that the three victims Rakesh Madavi (25) of Thadezari, Rekhchand Rane (45) of Dhanori, and Sachin Shrirange (22) of Kosamtondi, were carrying fire-blowers and were caught in the fire. “The blast arising out of the blowers that are operated on fossil fuel caused the death of the three van majoors who were on a hill and could not escape as they were surrounded by the fire from all sides. Some labourers also tried to climb up a tree but one of them fell down and died,” says the memorandum. The HWLWs have said these van majoors should be declared martyrs and there should be check on quality of fire blowers procured by the park. The victims were engaged in dousing the fire without any safety gear like boots or firefighter jackets or trousers. There was no first aid or medical kit with the groups. Henceforth, this gear should be made mandatory. HWLW Bahekar alleged the fire was manmade and it could be the handiwork of tendu contractors. As per rules, no tendu units or collection centres are allowed within three km from the park. This fact should be probed whether the fire was 3km from the tendu unit and if necessary action should be taken against the contractor. “It has been proved time and again that forest fires occur ahead of tendu and mahua collection season. As national parks and sanctuaries are vulnerable, no tendu collection should be allowed within 5km radius of the park boundaries. Rules should be amended,” said Bahekar. On the issue of inquiry, M Ramanujam, conservator of forests (CF) and field director, NNTR, said, “We have not yet started any inquiry as there were more fires reported in the last two days in the adjoining compartments. Secondly, of the Rs 5 lakh assistance to each of victims’ kin announced by the chief minister on Friday, Rs 3 lakh has been released to the Gondia collector from CM Relief Fund.” “The balance Rs 4 lakh each will be released after we submit copies of the police panchnama, post-mortem report, death certificate, and other papers to the state government. The Rs 4 lakh assistance will be released under State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF),” said Ramanujam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/firefighters-in-nagzira-were-without-safety-gear-first-aid-kit/articleshow/82022495.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Delhi||Delhi records 10,774 new Covid cases, highest in a single day||NEW DELHI: The fourth Covid-19 wave in the city is for real. From a low of 94 cases as late as February 16, it recorded 10,774 new cases in the last 24 hours. In the process, it overtook Mumbai (9,986 cases on Sunday) in terms of single-day tally and now accounts for 7% of the country's total daily cases. Delhi's previous single-day high was 8,593 cases, recorded last November 11. It recorded 48 deaths due to Covid-19 on Sunday - the highest this year. The total death toll so far is 11,283, fourth-highest in the country. Maharashtra has recorded maximum 57,987 deaths, followed by Karnataka (12,889) and Tamil Nadu (12,908). Gurgaon, too, reached a grim milestone, breaching the 1,000 mark for the first time. The new high of 1,084 cases took its overall tally to 70,141. Nearly a tenth of these cases were added this month itself. Delhi's positivity rate dipped marginally to 9.43% from Saturday's 10.21%. As Covid reaches fever pitch, Delhi reports 256 fatalities in last 11 daysDelhi ramped up its testing from 77,374 to 1,14,288 tests on Sunday. In February, the positivity rate had come down to a less than 1%, on at least five occasions. Initially, when the cases started peaking again in March, it was believed that while the transmissibility of the infection was high, fewer people were dying because of it. However, current data suggests the fatality rate remains high. Earlier, on November 18, the city had recorded 131 deaths due to the disease in a single day, which is the highest till date. In the last 11 days alone, from April 1 to 11, as many as 256 people have died due to the infection in the city. Worryingly, private hospitals in the city have run out of Covid beds with the rapid surge in numbers. “In mid-March, we had only five to six Covid-19 patients in the whole hospital. Today, we have more than 150 patients admitted. There are no ICU beds with or without ventilator,” Dr Y K Misra, chief of clinical services at Manipal hospital, Dwarka, claimed. Misra added that unlike the previous peaks witnessed in the national capital when admission was required mostly in the elderly people and those with co-morbidities, this time, several patients were less than 35 years old. Dr Shamsher Dwivedee, chief of clinical services at VIMHANS Nayati Hospital, said they were also facing an acute shortage of beds. “The Covid-19 cases have increased exponentially. If this trend continues or grows further, there will be a serious crisis,” he added. The number of active cases in the national capital has touched 34,341. Of them, 17,093 patients are in home isolation. More than 6,000 patients are admitted in hospitals while the rest are recuperating at Covid health centres and care centres. Delhi recorded the first case of Covid-19 on March 2. The first peak in cases was reported in the city in June when maximum 3,947 cases and 68 deaths were reported in a day on June 23. The second and third peaks came in September and November, respectively. On September 16, Delhi had recorded 4,473 new cases and 33 deaths. On November 11, Delhi recorded 8,953 cases and 79 deaths in a day. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal termed the current peak as the fourth wave. “The fourth wave is very dangerous. It is spreading very fast so much so that it is beyond the understanding of many people,” Kejriwal said in a digital press briefing on Sunday. “This peak is even more dangerous than the one we witnessed in November,” the chief minister added. The state government said it is accelerating the speed of vaccination to contain the crisis in addition to expanding the infrastructure and manpower required to treat patients. On Sunday, Delhi vaccinated more than one lakh for the first time since the mass immunisation against Covid-19 began in the national capital in January.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-records-10774-new-covid-cases-highest-in-a-single-day/articleshow/82023289.cms||---
---||Goa||Vehicles on S Goa beaches continue to create confusion, endanger lives||Colva: In March 2018, an offence was registered against former minister Mickky Pacheco by Verna police for driving his vehicle on the beach at Consua, Utorda, and causing damage to a parachute belonging a watersports operator. Trial in the case is currently on. A year earlier in Sernabatim, a 73-year-old traditional fisherman was hit by a vehicle being driven on the beach in the dead of the night, wrecking the victim’s spinal cord. These are just some of the incidents of the menace of driving on beaches, which continues unabated in South Goa.Not only are private vehicles being driven on to the beaches to load and transport fish, two-wheelers are also being ridden by tourists on the beach, endangering lives of locals and tourists alike. In 2018, the South Goa collector had issued an order prohibiting movement of all motor vehicles on beaches, with the exception of vehicles deployed for the purpose of beach cleaning, lifeguard services, tourist security force and police department. The Goa Civic and Consumer Action Network (GoaCan), which has been campaigning for awareness on cautious driving for years, had written to various authorities for stricter implementation of this order. But nothing concrete has come out of GoaCan’s efforts. Tourism department officials state that under the Central Motor Vehicles Act, movement of all kinds of vehicles is prohibited on beaches and the state government has appointed the district collectors as the competent authorities to exercise the powers conferred by the act. “The police stations concerned should be asked to submit compliance reports and the deputy director of transport should be requested to take suitable action under the act against the license of offenders and against vehicle owners. The tourism department should be directed to install signage against driving on the beach,” GoaCan convener Roland Martins said. He said the issue was discussed at the recent meetings chaired by South Goa MP Francisco Sardinha and at the meeting of the monitoring cell chaired by DySP traffic (South) Prabodh B Shirwaikar. Colva police, meanwhile, said that after much effort they had managed to stop tourists and locals from driving on the beach stretch. “But at times tourists get excited being in Goa and flout norms out of ignorance,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vehicles-on-s-goa-beaches-continue-to-create-confusion-endanger-lives/articleshow/82022557.cms||Nisser Dias

It was attended by a diverse spectrum ranging from graduate/post graduate students, faculties, researchers, industry etc. in addition to the general viewers leading to over 1,200 views on YouTube. “The emergence of the pandemic and the unfolding health crisis has necessitated the quest for novel natural products,” the NIO stated. According to them marine organisms that constitute a major share of our planet’s bioresources, also manifest “unique molecular, cellular and organismal features that include largely unexplored diverse bioactive compounds,” in addition to which “physiological adaptations offer a unique opportunity for advancement in both basic biological science and biotechnological exploitation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-health-crisis-unfolding-there-is-need-for-natural-products-nio/articleshow/82022594.cms||---

And nobody has a clue when the jammed roads will get clear. This is how a doctor battling crisis at Central Gujarat’s biggest hospital – SSG Hospital - described the Covid-19 situation in Vadodara where occupancy of wards and ICU beds is on all-time high. Vadodara ‘officially’ has started adding nearly 400 Covid-19 positive patients on daily basis while the number of patients requiring oxygen or ventilator support nears 300 mark. But at the same time, there are 7,800 plus beds that are currently occupied in government and private hospitals in the city and its periphery. The number of patients hospitalised in the city at present is more than even the total number of beds – 7,100 plus - that were available a fortnight ago. In fact, the occupancy rate increased from nearly 20 % in beginning of February to 59 % in March-end and now it is nearing 80 %. “I am calling up all the contacts available to get a bed for my father but most of the hospitals are turning down. They have collected my contact details and informed me that they will get back to me once there is a vacancy but there is no deadline to that,” said Himanshu Patel, a Atladara resident. Doctors on the other hand said that beds are not getting vacant as the number of influx from other districts is continuously on the rise and since many of them come at an advanced stage they are directly occupying ICU beds in the city. “Since they come in advanced stage, they occupy the ICU beds for longer period. Even if a patient dies in course of treatment, some procedural time is required to make the same bed available to another patient,” a senior doctor, handling administration at SSG Hospital told TOI, adding that the hospital which now has 800 Covid-19 beds and 250 ICU beds is facing acute shortage of manpower. All resources of both the state-run SSG Hospital and GMERS Medical College and Hospital, Gotri are being full utilised. On Saturday night, two trucks with 100 ventilators of Bharat Electronics Limited too reached Vadodara from Hyderabad. Dr Vinod Rao, officer on special duty for Covid-19 in Vadodara, said, “We are distributing them to our government hospitals and free bed private hospitals. We have kept biomedical engineers and technicians on stand-by and the ventilators would be installed today itself.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/beds-tripled-in-two-months-occupancy-up-10-fold/articleshow/82019608.cms||Prashant Rupera
---||Surat||Remdesivir row: CM Rupani skirts question, Paatil defiant||Surat: Even as relatives of Covid-19 patients across Gujarat sweat it out in the blistering heat to trace remdesivir, state BJP president CR Paatil remained firm that he had done nothing wrong by procuring the huge stock of 5,000 injections. On Sunday, CM Vijay Rupani in Patan skirted a question over the controversy sparked by one person managing to get such a huge supply of schedule-H drug, Paatil blamed the Congress for fuelling the row. However, Paatil refused to reveal the source of the huge stock and instead lambasted the Congress of being ‘jealous’ and raking up an unnecessary controversy on the matter. “I distributed tetracycline worth lakhs after the 1992 flood when the Congress government was in power. Nobody questioned my intentions then. I have been distributing oxygen, masks, sanitizer and food to patients and their families since Covid-19 started,” he said, when questioned as to how he could manage to get such a huge stock of the drug even when the state was reeling under its acute shortage. Despite several attempts district collector Dhaval Patel was not available for his comments. Expectedly, party leaders like BJP Majura MLA, Harsh Sanghvi too defended him and said: “It is a political controversy created by Congress. They should first serve people and then criticize others who are helping people.” Paatil, who remained firm that he had done nothing wrong by procuring the huge stock of 5,000 injections, said the party is distributing it for free as there is a crisis and the collector withdrew the system for its distribution. “Hence, we pushed from our side to arrange supply. We aren’t doing anything wrong by doing so,” he added. Meanwhile, hopeful of getting the injection, people started queuing up outside the city BJP office early on Sunday morning as well as outside Kiran Hospital which procured 10,000 vials of the injection on Saturday. “I have come to get an injection for my uncle. Two members of our family are standing in two queues at Kiran Hospital and the BJP office in the hope of getting the injections,” said Mayur Patel, at the BJP office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/remdesivir-row-cm-rupani-skirts-question-paatil-defiant/articleshow/82020859.cms||---

---||Delhi||Step out only if you must, says Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Terming the fourth wave of Covid-19 infection more dangerous than the previous ones, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday urged Delhiites to stay home and venture out only if absolutely necessary. The CM said that Delhi government did not want to impose a lockdown and people should get admitted to a hospital only if they really needed to, as any government would have to impose a lockdown if the hospital management collapsed. "The fourth wave is very dangerous. It is spreading very fast, so much so that it is beyond the understanding of many people," Kejriwal said in a digital press briefing. "This peak is even more dangerous than the one we witnessed in November," he added. "We do not want to impose a lockdown, but yesterday, helplessly, the government has been ordered to impose a few restrictions," Kejriwal said. "I am not in favour of a lockdown. I feel that lockdown is not the solution to corona. It should be imposed by any government when its hospital structure collapses (sic)," he said. He said if Delhiites cooperated and hospital facilities stayed under control, the government wouldn't have to impose a lockdown. "However, in case the number of beds in hospitals starts falling short, we might have to impose a lockdown," he said, requesting people to leave hospital beds for more serious patients. "If everyone starts to run to the hospitals, we would fall short of beds, ventilators and ICU facilities," Kejriwal said, adding that those who are asymptomatic, or have 'simple' symptoms should remain in home isolation. He said some people were only going to private hospitals, but their bed capacity was lower. He said very good treatment was being provided in Delhi government's hospitals now, adding that Delhi Corona mobile application, launched last June, showed bed availability in real time. Patients, he added, should be taken straight away to a hospital where beds were available instead of running from one facility to another. Kejriwal said it was a strange contradiction that now that we had a vaccine for Covid, the infection was spreading rapidly and, thus, citizens needed to be vaccinated at a faster pace. He said that he had requested the central government multiple times to remove all restrictions on the vaccination process. "The Delhi government is ready to go to each and every house and vaccinate the people," he said. He said that 65% of patients in Delhi were less than 45 years old and all restrictions on age and on opening up of centres should be removed. "This is not the time for politics or pointing fingers at each other. We could indulge in politics later. As of now, we should work together and serve the citizens of Delhi," he said. Kejriwal said: "Many people who don't wear a mask say that it has been a year and they are now tired. Think about our doctors, nurses and the paramedic staff who have been working day and night, 24 hours, from the past one year. Aren't they tired? They are more tired than you are. If they can work for 24 hours from the past one year, risking their own life, then the least you can do is wear a mask." "The way that Delhiites faced the previous three peaks with such great vigour, this time too we will face the fourth wave together," the CM added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/step-out-only-if-you-must-says-delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal/articleshow/82023327.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Section 144 was clamped in parts of Khowai, West Tripura, Sepahijala, Gomati and South Tripura districts even as Debbarman warned his supporters on Sunday that violence, whatever the provocation, wouldn’t be tolerated, reports Biswendu Bhattacharjee . Workers of the Tipraha Indigenous Progressive Regional Alliance, which along with the INPT won 18 out of 28 seats in the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council polls, had allegedly attacked BJP and IPFT cadres and set offices ablaze in the aftermath of a famous victory. In a video message laced with anguish, Debbarman said, “Before the victory, I had urged everyone not to indulge in any form of violence, but I got reports from various parts of the state that in the name of TIPRA, people are collecting money for victory rallies, attacking houses and people from other parties. I won’t tolerate this.” He pointed out that “the culture of post-poll and post-victory violence on opposition party workers” had been a feature of Bengal and Tripura for many decades.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agartala/violence-follows-victory-of-tripura-royal-scion-sec-144-in-5-districts/articleshow/82023329.cms||---

This was announced by its founder C S Ghosh at a webinar to commemorate 20 years of Bandhan. Through its two decades of existence, Bandhan transformed from its original avatar of an NGO called Bandhan-Konnagar, to an NBFC (non-banking finance corporation), and finally to a pan-India universal lender — Bandhan Bank. Ghosh later told TOI that both the Bandhan University and hospital will be near Kolkata. “At Bandhan, we are also working towards establishing a hospital which will cater to all kinds of general requirements but focus more on diabetes,” he said. Ghosh pointed out that initially, the hospital would cater to out-patients, including complete diagnostic facilities, along with day-care services. “With experience and with demand, we plan to expand it to a 200-bed hospital in about five years’ time. We are committed to serving the holistic healthcare needs of communities,” he added. Elaborating the education initiative, Ghosh added that Bandhan is committed to partner with meritorious students from not-so-privileged backgrounds in their journey of education from pre-primary to graduation and even post-graduation. According to him, under Bandhan Education Programme, non-formal schools have been set up where children from underprivileged background get access to quality free education from pre-primary to Class III. After completing Class III, children get admitted to government schools. “We have observed that after the children move out of the non-formal schools, their progress and journey is very difficult to track. Among them are children who are extremely bright and who could do very well in their lives, if groomed properly. In order to enable them to continue their journey of quality education, we have set up seven formal schools, which are affiliated to CBSE. Here they receive education till standard 10. As on date, more than 14,000 students study in these schools,” Ghosh said. Commenting on the proposed university, he pointed out that it is currently working towards setting up Bandhan University for higher education. “Meritorious students from the Bandhan Academy will be offered admission to Bandhan University. This institution will aim at creating future leaders and policy makers, who will be equipped with all the skills and knowledge to create large scale social transformation,” he added. Renowned economist and Nobel laureate Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee and noted business leader and ITC chairman & managing director Sanjiv Puri also spoke on the occasion of Bandhan-Konnagar’s 20th anniversary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bandhan-embarks-on-hospital-varsity-and-school-chain/articleshow/82021257.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Min’s social media site tampered with saying exams cancelled||Nagpur: The message on a social media site of Maharashtra school education minister on Saturday announcing the “cancellation of SSC and HSC examinations” has created quit a furore and hoopla from the minister’s side and in education fraternity. Minister Varsha Gaikwad has vehemently denied of taking any such decision and asked students not to fall for this fake message. She, however, has clarified that any such decision will be taken only after apprising CM Udhav Thackeray of the present Covid conditions. “We are certainly planning to postpone the examinations but an official announcement in this regard will be taken only after meeting with the CM,” she said. A highly placed source in the education department told TOI that the meeting with the CM may happen as early as Monday. “If not, then by Tuesday definitely this proposal will be shared with the CM. An official announcement will take place soon after he gives the green signal,” the source said. The official did not clarify whether the entire schedule will be postponed or just few initial papers will be shifted to the end. The fake message factory with a morphed image of the minister landed in various groups. The fake image altered the text on Gaikwad’s Twitter timeline to announce cancellation of the examinations. The image was edited so professionally that it was impossible to believe it a fake one. Also, unlike other fake messages, there was not even a single spelling mistake and the font’s size and type was perfectly aligned with the minister’s official page. TOI was the first, and only till date, to report about the department’s plans to postpone the exams. As Covid-19 infection spreading even among youngsters, many ministers feel it will be unwise to risk the health of students now. CM Thackeray has already announced his intentions of implementing a stricter version of the prevailing lockdown, though no final date has been set yet. School education minister Varsha Gaikwad’s team had anticipated this scenario by taking proactive steps in the first few days of April itself. The minister started meeting with various stakeholders and gathered their views on what steps can be taken regarding board students as well as those studying in Std I-IX and XI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mins-social-media-site-tampered-with-saying-exams-cancelled/articleshow/82022175.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Energy minister Balineni Srinivas Reddy has asked power utilities to focus on strengthening safe, reliable and cheap electricity supply to consumers in future as well as in becoming the most consumer-centric utilities in the country. The government has agreed to bear a burden of Rs 9,091.36 crore for 2021-22 as subsidy for providing free power to agriculture consumers and some other weaker sections and subsidy for domestic consumers as well. “The government wants to see fulfillment in the eyes of every farmers by ensuring that the free power scheme is implemented more effectively. Our motive is to provide quality power to the consumers without adding any burden. We should be the best by next Ugadi,” minister added. Secretary for energy Srikant Nagulapalli said that the power utilities were taking all necessary steps to supply uninterrupted power during summer as the demand for electricity is steadily increasing. He said that the power utilities would be more cautious during the summer to avoid any inconvenience to people due to any interruption in power supply. “The power utilities have already taken up network improvement works to meet consumer satisfaction by supplying quality power and utilities will also strive hard to reach the expectation of the state government,” the secretary said. Providing round-the-clock affordable and quality electricity to all sectors is one of the top priorities of government. This will create assurance among consumers, mainly in industrial consumers which boosts investments in the state and we are working hard to achieve it, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/state-to-emerge-as-no-1-in-quality-power-supply-min/articleshow/82019785.cms||---

Even while preserving the traditional practices like Kalamkari and handicraft that are endemic to the constituency, priority will be accorded towards upskilling artisans, said Narasimha Rao. Critical care hospitals will be established in Chittoor and Nellore districts. Modernisation of market yards, establishment of cold storage facilities, micro irrigation facility and low-cost debts to cattle and sheep rearers are the other promises. Targetting the coastal areas, BJP promised Kisan credit cards to fishermen families, development of Pulicat lake and fishing harbours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/special-body-to-run-ttd-says-bjp-in-manifesto/articleshow/82019857.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

---||Goa||Goa: ‘Help locate illegal borewells in Cuncolim industrial estate’||PANAJI: After the South Goa police failed to conduct an investigation, the Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) has written to the inspector general of police (IGP) to direct his officers to locate borewells illegally dug by companies involved in the production of fish meal at the Cuncolim industrial estate. Earlier in February, GSPCB had written to SP, South Goa, to help locate the illegal borewells which were discharging untreated effluents and to submit its report within seven days. GSPCB environmental engineer Sanjeev Joglekar wrote a letter to the IGP stating, “I am directed to inform you that the board had issued a letter to the SP to investigate and find out exact location of the borewells illegally dug within the premises of fish meal/fish processing plants. However no reply has been received by the board till date. You (IGP), are requested to direct the concerned to investigate and inquire regarding the illegal borewells dug within the premises of fishmeal and fish processing units at Cuncolim industrial estate.” Joglekar said that there are many such firms that have dug bore wells in the industrial estate and that the pollution board had received complaints from other firms as well as private individuals. One complaint stated that an environment audit was carried out at one such fishmeal plant and illegally dug borewells were found where raw fish water and other effluents were being discharged into the ground water. “Now, in order to find precise location of these borewells, I hereby submit the details of the person/company responsible for digging the borewells, mostly in the Cuncolim industrial estate. I call upon you to lodge a police complaint against the suspected company and persons who dug the borewells without authorisation so that the police can help in your inquiry to find the exact location of several borewells illegally dug within the premises of fishmeal plants,” the complaint read. Another complainant said that there was an urgent need to apply various sections of the Water (Prevention and control of Pollution) Act 1974 which prohibits use of a stream or a well for disposal of polluting matter, etc. TOI had reported that GSPCB had conducted inspections to locate the illegal borewells. While it identified over 20 such borewells, several others could not be located. On November 5 and 6, GSPCB conducted a ground penetration radar (GPR) survey of four fish meal and fish processing units – United Marine Products, Quality Foods, Sagar Feeds and Food Processing Industries and Indotech Ice and Cold Storage. GSPCB sent a notice to the four units stating that the survey found that chambers/pits/pipes were located underground within their premises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/help-locate-illegal-borewells-in-cuncolim-industrial-estate/articleshow/82022307.cms||---

The registrar of cooperative societies has also said that these societies have to comply with disclosure norms and release quarterly financial statements, along with information about the board of directors and management. Registrar of cooperative societies Arvind Khutkar said that the directives have been issued “to secure proper management” of these societies, and to prevent the affairs of these societies from being conducted in “a manner detrimental” to the interest of the depositors and other stakeholders. Cooperative credit societies with a turnover between Rs 10 crore to Rs 100 crore will now have to appoint a team of professionals to manage their day-to-day affairs, with at least three members comprising senior auditors, along with a senior retired government officer from the registrar of cooperative societies or any nationalized bank. The management board, which cannot exceed more than five members, will advise the society in its day-to-day functioning and appraise and recommend all loan proposals. The board of directors will be tasked with overseeing loan recoveries and settlements, utilization of deposits and funds, along with risk management for the society. Khutkar said that all the societies which offer credit will have to adopt software linking all the branches and computers with a core banking solution within six months. These credit societies will also have to safely store user data. Credit societies with a C or D audit classification will have to bring their interest rates for loans and deposits on par with the rate fixed by the nationalized banks with a variation of 2 percentage points permitted. The government has also directed that within 60 days of a financial quarter ending, the societies will have to disclose their audited financial results, along with other statutory compliances. Along with this, details of internal elections, shareholders and the management board will have to be disclosed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-brings-in-reforms-to-clean-up-coop-sector-calls-for-proper-mgmt/articleshow/82021628.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Kolkata||Don’t politicise it, says Shah, questions CM’s ‘silence’ on Rajbanshi boy’s death||Shantipur (Nadia): Accusing chief minister Mamata Banerjee of attempting to “politicise” the Sitalkuchi deaths, Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday told her that it was her “gherao CRPF” comment that was responsible. He also responded to her call for resignation, saying he was ready to do so “if people in Bengal ask him to”, but it would be Banerjee herself who would have to put in her papers, come May 2. “The incident is being politicised,” Shah said while speaking to reporters after a road show at Shantipur, Nadia. “I have seen Mamata Didi’s statement.... A few days back, at a rally, she asked people to gherao CISF and CAPF units. She asked people to attack them. I want to ask her, ‘Wasn’t your statement responsible for the death of the four persons?’” Shah, expressing grief over the “unfortunate death”, said: “Had she not spoken like that, could they have mustered the courage to attack the jawans? She should apologise for her statement.” Shah also accused the Trinamool of leaving out the name of Ananda Burman, while paying homage to the deceased, as the youth, a Rajbanshi, was “not from her vote-bank”. The 18-year-old Burman, a first-time voter, was the first victim of poll violence in Sitalkuchi on Saturday morning. “Mamata Didi never took Burman’s name, who died that very morning. Every death is sad, and she should have expressed grief over Burman’s death too. Burman was killed in front of the same booth when the goons wanted to stop polling in that booth,” said Shah. “She never paid homage because Burman does not represent her vote bank. This is not Bengal’s political culture.” Trinamool Congress later said the CM referred to all five deaths and the plaque where she paid homage on Sunday bore all five names, not four. The Election Commission had served a notice to Banerjee on her comment about central forces, to which she had replied. The EC’s notice was based on the state chief electoral officer’s report and authorised transcripts of a speech Banerjee delivered in Cooch Behar on April 7, where she is heard telling women voters to “restrain (gherao) CAPF (personnel) if they create disturbances”. Later, at a rally in Basirhat, Shah said Banerjee was asking for his resignation. “If the people of West Bengal demand that I put down my papers, I am ready to do so with my head bowed. I would like to remind her that on May 2, she will have to tender her resignation to the governor. Mamata Didi is not a small leader. She is known across the country. After she resigns to the governor, her farewell will also be an elaborate one,” he said, adding that the BJP would win 200 seats across Bengal. Shah also alleged that she was opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act “to appease illegal immigrants” who, he claimed, took the benefits of welfare schemes but indulged in riots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dont-politicise-it-says-shah-questions-cms-silence-on-rajbanshi-boys-death/articleshow/82022369.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||Dilip warns ‘naughty boys’ of many more Sitalkuchis across Bengal||Kolkata: Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh on Sunday warned of “many Sitalkuchis” if there were “excesses” in Bengal, saying it was “dustu chheles (naughty boys)” who had fallen prey to bullets on Saturday. His comments, a day after Bengal’s bloodiest day of elections, drew a sharp response from the Trinamool Congress, who demanded his arrest. “Beshi barabari korle Sitalkuchi te dekhechhen ki hoyechhe. Jaygay jaygay Sitalkuchi hobe (If there is any excess, Sitalkuchi will be repeated everywhere),” Ghosh said while addressing a rally in Baranagar. He, however, termed the deaths “unfortunate.” “Eto dushtu chhele kotha theke elo? Oi dushtu chhele guli kheyeche kal Sitalkuchite. (From where did so many naughty boys come? Those naughty boys were shot yesterday at the Sitalkuchi),” Ghosh said. He said that Bengal would have no place for such naughty boys if BJP forms the government. “It has just begun. Those who think the central forces have brought the guns just to show off, are mistaken. They have now understood the heat of the bullets,” he added. Ghosh said Saturday’s violence would be repeated across Bengal if anyone tried to break the law and get in the way of fair polling. “On April 17, there will be central forces guarding booths. If anyone tries to scare you, we are here,” he said. Ghosh alleged that the Trinamool was trying to play politics with the bodies, adding that the Election Commission had done the right thing by stopping political functionaries from entering the area. “They have done the right thing. She has done politics with bodies all these years. She tried to enter Cooch Behar to do the same. But the EC has stopped political leaders from entering the area, so that no fresh tension is created,” he said. Mocking Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for her plastered leg, Ghosh said she is trying to garner sympathy. “Her legs are fine, yet she has wrapped a bandage around it. But people have made up their mind and decided to choose Sada Dari (white beard, alluring to PM Modi) over Sada Sari (white sari of Mamata Banerjee).” Ghosh’s statements evoked strong reactions from the TMC. The party’s Rajya Sabha chief whip, Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, said: “We want the immediate resignation of Union home minister Amit Shah and arrest of Dilip Ghosh.” Lok Sabha MP Abhishek Banerjee said: “The Prime Minister yesterday expressed grief over the incident at Sitalkuchi. His colleague Dilip Ghosh said today that the incident will be repeated. None of the people there at Sitalkuchi was even carrying a stick. We will find out who incited the attack on the villagers. I urge both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah to expel Dilip Ghosh from the party. The PM should prove that he is not the Prime Minister of the BJP alone, but that of the entire country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dilip-warns-naughty-boys-of-many-more-sitalkuchis-across-bengal/articleshow/82022375.cms||Rohit Khanna

The ones who have been arrested are Rintu Singh, Priyanka Kumari Singh, Ankit Pratap Singh and Vikas Singh. Seven mobile phones, debit card, gold chain and aadhaar cards have been seized from them. Ranchi SSP Surindra Jha said on Sunday, “We were receiving reports that members of Sujit Sinha gang were active in different districts of the state and making extortion calls to traders, contractors and land dealers. They were threatening to kill the businessmen if they failed to pay.” A team led by DSP Neeraj Kumar raided various places in Ranchi and arrested four accused in this connection, the SSP said, adding that investigation in the case was underway. In another development, police have arrested three persons for murdering 22-year-old Abu Talah under Itki police station of Ranchi district on April 8. The arrested persons are Abu Lesh Alam, Md Kaif and Araslan Anjar. Talah was thrashed to death with stone near Urdu Girl’s High School. The police had registered a case under sections 302 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code and formed a team under Bedo DSP Rajat Manik Barla to investigate the case. Speaking to media persons on Sunday, Rural SP Naushad Alam said, “The murder was carried out owing to personal enmity.

Of the three municipal areas, Jamshedpur Notified Area Committee (JNAC) has the maximum number of containment zones at 350. While Mango Notified Area Committee houses 75 micro containment zones, Jugsalai Municipality has four and 57 have been set up in the peripheral areas of Jamshedpur. Of the 1,340 active cases in the district, almost 90% are from the Steel City. In the urban circle, Kadma, Mango, Sonari, Sakchi, Bistupur, Telco and Sidhgora, have been identified as Covid-19 hot spots as most number of cases have surfaced from these parts. To ensure proper rules are being followed, the East Singhbhum administration constituted a special committee to periodically visit the micro containment zones and examine the conditions in person. The nine-member team, led by district public relations officer Rohit Kumar, will inspect the rooms meant for home isolation and ensure patients are using separate toilets. The isolation rooms will be videographed as well. It will also make random video calls to persons in home isolation to check whether they are living at the home. If the committee finds any lack in facilities, it will recommend the health department to cancel the home isolation facility. “Jamshedpur is a small town and densely populated, hence the pace of contracting the virus is fast. Wearing face masks, maintaining social distancing, sanitization and vaccination are important measures to fight coronavirus,” said Dr V K Singh, a private practitioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/micro-containments-rise-to-486-in-east-singhbhum-district/articleshow/82020108.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A police team was camping at Rampur village at the time of filing this report in the evening to prevent any flare-up in the area. Police said Ansari and his girlfriend belonged to the same religious community. Locals told the police that the assailants were enraged after learning about Ansari’s affair with their sister. The girl had reportedly posted a photograph along with Ansari on Facebook recently. Talking to TOI from the village, Lohardaga SDPO Jitendra Singh said, "Prima facie it appears that Ansari was thrashed and even strangled near a village drain as the corpse was smeared in mud." Singh said Ansari and his assailants are from the same village. “The brothers came across Ansari’s photograph with their sister in her mobile phone. Enraged, they came after Ansari and thrashed him brutally,” Singh added. In retaliation to the killing, a mob set ablaze the motorcycle of the assailants and even tried to torch their home. “The accused are absconding and efforts are underway to arrest them,” Singh said. Police refrained from divulging the identities of Ansari’s assailants. Lohardaga police station officer-in-charge Mantu Kumar said an FIR was yet to be filed as Ansari's relatives are yet to file a formal complaint. Lohardaga DC Dilip Kumar Toppo said the situation has returned to normal in the village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/man-strangled-by-his-girlfriends-brothers-in-lohardaga/articleshow/82020155.cms||K A Gupta
---||Ranchi||Adivasis demand self-rule in Scheduled areas||Ranchi: Several Adivasi community members under the banner of Compat Munda 22 Padha Kendra Pakra on Sunday staged a demonstration to demand implementation of self-rule in the state's Scheduled areas. Leaders of the community garlanded a statue of Birsa Munda and later held a meeting at the Birsa Chowk here to pursue their demands. They had initially planned to take out a procession but withdrew it after the district administration officials reminded them that processions were banned under the new Covid-19 control laws along with the implementation of Section 144 of CrPC. Speaking on their demands, Luthar Topno, a protester, claimed that Adivasis have the right to self-rule and they are the owners of natural resources in a Scheduled area. He mentioned that the laws promulgated by the Centre and the state are applicable in the Scheduled area with certain exceptions, which must be followed. He also claimed that under the existing norms in the Constitution, police have no right to enforce their norms in areas under self-rule. Topno further said in 2007, President Late APJ Abdul Kalam had written a letter to the governors of states stating that governance in Scheduled areas would run according to the existing traditions of the Adivasis. The order has not been implemented even after several years, he said, adding that Governor Droupadi Murmu had on February 23, 2021, assured that she would call a meeting of leaders of various Adivasi communities within a month for the formulation of a policy on Adivasi rights but no step has been taken so far. Other speakers said it is only the Adivasis who have the executive, legislative and judicial power in the Scheduled areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/adivasis-demand-self-rule-in-scheduled-areas/articleshow/82020168.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Kolkata||It’s genocide; Modi Code of Conduct in Bengal: Mamata||Siliguri/Kolkata: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, in her harshest criticism yet, has termed Saturday’s deaths in Sitalkuchi a “Nandigram-style genocide”. She has also said that the Election Commission should rename the Model Code of Conduct as the “Modi Code of Conduct”, while dubbing the poll panel’s 72-hour ban on travelling to Cooch Behar — which prevented her from meeting the victims’ kin — “inhuman and unprecedented”. On Saturday, during Bengal’s fourth round of polling, five people were killed, four of them when a CISF unit that had been attacked opened fire on a mob, in Cooch Behar’s Sitalkuchi. The other victim of Saturday’s violence was first-time voter Ananda Burman (18), who was gunned down by bike-borne assailants as he stepped out of a polling booth after casting his vote. The EC, in an unprecedented order, later barred the entry of leaders of all political parties into Cooch Behar for the next 72 hours, citing “law and order” concerns. On Sunday, the chief minister reached out to the bereaved families over video call from Siliguri. While explaining why she could not travel to meet them, she assured them that she would meet them in person after the ban is lifted on April 14 (Wednesday). Later, addressing the press draped in a black shawl in protest, Banerjee minced no words. “Nandigram was a genocide. This was also a genocide,” she said, explaining she was using this term because the victims were shot “in the neck and chest, not in their feet or lower parts of their body”. The 72-hour window imposed by the EC, she said, would allow “evidence to be destroyed”, since both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah had already given a “clean chit” to the central forces. The CM also countered the forces’ “self-defence” claim and questioned — like some experts did on Saturday — why lethal weapons were employed in crowd control. “Where are the injuries (to the central forces)? For law and order, there must be a lathi-charge, bursting of tear gas. These people were standing in a queue to cast their votes,” she said, adding, “The central forces cited problems. Did anyone try to resolve them? These are poor migrant labourers who had come to vote. People who died were around 20-25 years old; one had a pregnant wife at home, the other a three-year-old-daughter. It was a murder of democracy.” “The CISF guards installations. They are neither trained for law and order duty, nor to control mob. The bullets were sprayed on the chest and neck,” she said, asking party functionaries in Cooch Behar to consult lawyers to lodge FIRs “because they may try to destroy evidence”. “After all this, they want to suppress facts, which is why they have imposed the 72-hour ban,” she alleged, brushing aside allegations that she was trying to politicise the incident. “We need to save Bengal. They are trying to capture it with brute force,” she said. She later addressed public rallies in Jalpaiguri and Raigunj before attending a road show in Burdwan, where she held a candle-light vigil in protest. At Siliguri, she also called PM Modi and Shah “incompetent”, alleging, “Ora misti mukhey khun korte pare (They can kill people with a smile on their faces).” On the Cooch Behar police superintendent’s “shot-in-self-defence” statement, she simply said, “The SP had been appointed by the BJP. It does not behove me to comment on an SP. What can I say, I just feel sad. We will take care once I take the oath again.” Banerjee said the answer to this violence would be through the elections. “People need to avenge these bullets with ballots. We will avenge the death of our brothers. Today we are observing a black day in protest, demanding Amit Shah’s resignation. We want his resignation for this firing,” she said. Asked by reporters on the death of 18-year-old Rajbanshi youth Ananda Burman, also in Sitalkuchi, Banerjee said: “He was our supporter. They did not even spare our candidate, Girish Chandra Burman.” Questioning the EC’s move to stop her from meeting the bereaved families, the CM said: “I kept my word. I spoke to them. Had I gone there, I would have spoken to them and perhaps shared their grief. Elections are over in Cooch Behar. Why was I stopped? Rules are being changed every day to help a particular political party. They cannot change rules. If institutions collapse, democracy will end.... I always go to people when they are in need. I rushed here when there was an earthquake in Kalimpong and Kurseong (in September 2011). I stay with people for 365 days. The MCC is now BCC — the BJP Code of Conduct. The EC is listening to whatever BJP is saying. They are deliberately stopping me from campaigning in North Bengal (as the EC has extended the silence period to 72 hours ahead of the April 17 polls). They cannot stop me like this.” The CM said she had asked the state administration to provide Rs 5 lakh compensation to the kin of the victims. “I believe the chief secretary will announce that after they get permission from the EC. Now, even to help the victims, we need permission from EC.... Youths will pool in Rs 100 for the victims’ families. I have also decided to give them whatever is left of my candidate election fund. Every candidate has an election fund ceiling. But some funds remain unspent, I will give them all that I have (in the fund). I hope this does not violate the MCC.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/its-genocide-modi-code-of-conduct-in-bengal-mamata/articleshow/82022277.cms||Roshan Gupta
---||Kolkata||Covid: 1,109 new cases in Kolkata, highest so far||KOLKATA: The city recorded 1,109 new Covid cases on Sunday, the highest single-day spike since the beginning of the pandemic, even as the number of fresh cases in Bengal touched 4,398, the state’s highest ever. The numbers officially make it the worst phase of the pandemic in the state. The number of patients needing hospital care, too, has gone up, with hospital occupancy growing nearly 10 times between March and April (from 3.5% to 32.9%). The number of new cases jumped from 241 on March 10 to 4,043 on Saturday. Active cases grew by 2,763 in the last 24 hours in Bengal, in sharp contrast to the decline in January and February. On January 10, active cases had dropped by 153 in 24 hours; on February 10, cases dropped by 109 in a day. But March saw a reversal, with the active case count rising by 17 in 24 hours on the 10th. Since January 10, Bengal has seen nearly 50,000 new cases. However, hospital occupancy was never as high as in April. Even on January 10, the hospital occupancy was 8.5%. The rate gradually dipped to 6.7% in February and 3.5% in March. But it suddenly rose to 33%, sending hospitals into a tizzy. “We are again increasing Covid beds in hospitals keeping in mind the fallout of large gatherings at election meetings. The occupancy rate spiked. All the safe homes will now be reopened,” said a health department official. The state recorded 19 Covid deaths on January 10, which dropped to five on February 10 and to two on March 10. But on April 10, it rose to 12. “So, apart from increasing general Covid beds, we are ramping up the emergency facilities, like HDU and ICU, so that critically ill patients can get the maximum support. We are also requesting the private facilities to do the same,” said another senior official. On January 10, the number of total cases in Kolkata grew by 231 on January 10. There were three deaths and active cases were down by six in 24 hours. On April 10, active cases grew by 615 and there were four deaths. “The higher infectibility of newer strains is certainly a cause for concern. This is why Covid protocols are so important,” said Debasish Basu, a preventive medicine expert. Restaurants and hotels across the state are concerned that the recent spike in the number of cases will hit business hard. Restaurateurs and hotel owners fear there may be another lockdown after the elections as the second Covid wave rages through the country. They claimed they have already recorded a significant drop in sales due to the second wave and the polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/1109-new-covid-cases-in-kolkata-highest-so-far/articleshow/82022393.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kolkata||Bengal assembly elections: Congress veteran among attack targets, bombs found as phase 5 poll looms||KOLKATA: Clashes, attacks and recovery of arms and ammunition on Sunday marked West Bengal’s run-up to the fifth phase of polls scheduled for Saturday (April 17). Most clashes were reported between Trinamool Congress and main opposition party BJP. The trend was broken in Malda, a traditional Congress turf, where a clash broke out between Congress and Trinamool supporters. Congress veteran Abu Hasem Khan Choudhury (Dalu), brother of late Gani Khan Choudhury, was attacked by “Trinamool goons” on the way back from a political meeting at Fulbaria in Manikchak assembly constituency. Abu Hasem escaped without injury but Congress’ Manikchak candidate Mottakin Alam was targeted and his vehicle badly damaged in the attack allegedly led by Trinamool’s Jahidul Islam. Congress workers blocked roads across Malda district in protest. Abu Hasem said: “It was a planned attack on our lives by TMC goons.” Trinamool denied any involvement in the incident, which was condemned by BJP. A visibly embarrassed Trinamool candidate, Sabitri Mitra, also a former minister, said: “It was an unwanted incident. We never endo- rse such attacks. I think our workers were not involved.” A police team raided the spot following a complaint. No one has been arrested. In Nadia, a BJP booth president at Bandowan in Hanskhali, Subho Saha, suffered serious injury after suspected Trinamool toughs attacked him on his way back from PM Narendra Modi’s rally at Krishnagar College ground on Saturday. Another BJP worker, 30-year-old Tapas Sen, also returning from Modi’s meeting, was attacked with acid on the way back near Krishnagar church. Sen alleged that Trinamool goons attacked him. On Sunday, a busy market at Bhagawatipur in Chanditala was shut following clashes between BJP and Trinamool supporters that began soon after Saturday’s polling ended. Six Trinamool and four BJP workers were injured in the incident. Traders shuttered shops to prevent the violence from spilling over into the market. Angry BJP supporters allegedly pelted stones and brickbats at the house of a Trinamool panchayat member. A large police force was deployed to prevent any untoward incident. North and South 24 Parganas saw the recovery of arms and ammunition. In North 24 Parganas, police and central forces recovered 34 bombs and 17 rounds of cartridges from the local club at Madral Joychanditala in ward 33 of Bhatpara Municipality. At Sardarpara and Natunpara areas under Fulmalancha GP limits, a long firearm, eight rounds of live cartridges and a number of crude bombs were recovered on Sunday when Basanti police were carrying out area domination and combing operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cong-veteran-among-attack-targets-bombs-found-as-phase-5-poll-looms/articleshow/82021791.cms||---

The previous time the state saw over 10,000 cases a day was on October 10 (10,517), while Bengaluru’s previous record was 5,576 on April 9. The fresh cases took the state’s caseload to over 10.6 lakh with nearly 6.5% (69,225) of them being active cases. Bengaluru’ caseload is now over 4.8 lakh with 51,236 (10.6%) active cases. While the capital accounts for only 45% of the total cases in Karnataka, it accounts for 74% of the active case burden. Health minister K Sudhakar, who chaired an emergency meeting, said cases may further increase in May first week when the second wave is expected to peak and will start declining by end of May. Govt plans aggressive testing, contact tracingAny wave, as per experts, will be there for 80-120 days,” health minister K Sudhakar said. Health commissioner Dr KV Trilok Chandra told TOI: “Our strategy would, again, be aggressive testing, containment, contact tracing and isolation, besides severe enforcement of containment measures. As part of this approach, resources from all government departments, including teachers, will be roped in to do contact tracing as we did last year.” On testing, he said the state had been conducting at least 1 lakh tests even during the months when cases were low. “In fact, we are now touching 1.3 lakh tests per day and this would further be ramped up, while we are looking at doing nearly 3 lakh vaccinations per day,” Chandra added.

The state was left with only some 60,000 vaccine doses on Sunday. According to health officials, the state has so far received 40.44 lakh vaccine doses, both Covishield and Covaxin combined, from the Union government for the mass inoculation drive. AP almost exhausted the vaccine doses by April 10 itself by giving the jabs to nearly 2.3 lakh people on Saturday, the highest ever single-day vaccine coverage so far in the state. Despite the repeated requests from the state, the Centre has not sent the vaccine stocks in sufficient quantities to Andhra Pradesh in the last few days. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy recently wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting the latter for 25 lakh vaccine doses for the tika utsav. Jagan, in his letter, also highlighted the impending vaccine shortage. The state planned to cover a total of 24 lakh people during this utsav from April 11 to 14 by administering the vaccine to six lakh people a day. When TOI visited various vaccination centres in Visakhapatnam city on Sunday, no private or government vaccine facility was seen functioning for want of vaccine doses. Similar was the situation in almost all parts of the state. According to the official data, only some 56,000 vaccines were given by Sunday evening. The recipients, who were due for their second dose, have been finding it difficult to trace the vaccination centre, which gives a similar brand of vaccine they received as their first shot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/andhra-pradesh-runs-out-of-covid-vaccines-tika-utsav-hit/articleshow/82023427.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Bengaluru||More than 75% of Covid beds filled in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: With Bengaluru witnessing a huge surge in Covid-19 cases, hospitals and Covid Care Centres (CCCs) are filling up swiftly. There were less than 1,000 beds available as on Sunday, while three quarters of beds under government quota are already occupied. Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike officials say only 872 of 3,474 government quota beds in government and private hospitals and CCCs are vacant. As on Sunday evening, Bengaluru had 51,236 active cases. Government medical colleges such as Victoria Hospital and Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospitals were full by Sunday morning. Experts say the spread of infection is so quick that Bengaluru would soon be reporting at least 6,000 cases every day. The positivity rate in the city has touched 6.2%. While 26,262 persons were in home isolation as on Friday, 3,877 patients were admitted in private hospitals and 1,071 are in private CCCs. Till Sunday, Bengaluru had reported 4,81,982 positive cases and 4,815 deaths. Last week, the capital city reported an average 4,000 cases every day. Gaurav Gupta, BBMP commissioner, who visited CCCs established by Bosch company, said the civic agency is planning to open two or three CCCs with 50 beds each in every zone of the city. The move to establish CCCs comes in the wake of the spike in cases and a decision will be made in a day or two, he added. He also said that they are planning to increase vaccination sites to1,000 in the coming days. As of now, Haj Bhavan and HAL CCCs are active, while BBMP is all set to reopen National Games village in Koramangala which can accommodate 200 beds. Meanwhile, BBMP has been focusing on inoculating as many people and as quickly as possible and is planning to organise vaccine sessions in big apartments. A BBMP official said the civic body is mainly focussing on micro-level arrangements rather than creating a facility like they did last year at Bangalore International Exhibition Centre (BIEC). They said the idea is to isolate virus-infected people quickly but creating a facility with 10,000 beds will only lead to congregation again. Therefore, micro-level management is the best option, an official said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/more-than-75-of-covid-beds-filled-in-bengaluru/articleshow/82023433.cms||Kiran Parashar

Despite intervention by the Vanitha Sahayavani (women’s helpline) of Bengaluru police through extensive counselling sessions, the couple couldn’t bridge their differences and are set to part ways by mutual consent. It was love at first sight for Bhavesh and Smriti (names changed), who met at the office canteen of their BPO in Bengaluru in mid-2017. After courting for two years, they married in 2019 and rented a house in Subramanyanagar. Due to the crisis caused by Covid, 27-year-old Bhavesh lost his job and started looking for opportunities. Man took up sex work after he lost jobA few months later, his wife noticed something unusual as he was extremely engaged with his laptop and mobile phone, and started making untimely and unexplained visits to places about which he wouldn’t discuss in detail with her,” said BS Saraswathi, senior counsellor at Vanitha Sahayavani who counselled the couple in February. Laptop with secret folderGrowing extremely suspicious about his activities, in mid-November, Smirti took the help of her techie brother to crack open Bhavesh’s laptop only to find a folder with graphic photos. “She found a secret folder containing numerous nude photos of her husband and selfies of semi-naked women unknown to her. She discovered he was a male escort charging Rs 3,000 to Rs 5,000 per hour and had numerous clients in the city,” the counsellor said. Smriti confronted her 27-year-old husband with photographs from the laptop, but he refused to admit it was him. She consulted some of her close friends and landed at the Women’s Helpline housed at the Malleswaram police station in February thisyear. “During interaction in the presence of his wife, he admitted to becoming a commercial sex worker after he lost his job. He declared his love for his newfound secretive profession which was introduced to him by a close friend,” Saraswathi said. Bhavesh, at the same time, was not willing to let go of his wife of two years and promised to mend his ways by giving up being a gigolo. The woman was determined to end their relationship despite four sessions of counselling. The couple has filed a mutual-consent divorce petition in a city court, a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-out-of-job-hubby-turns-escort-wife-seeks-divorce/articleshow/82023475.cms||Petlee Peter
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Stir deadlock continues, only 15% buses on road||BENGALURU: Passengers using the state public transport buses continued to bear the brunt of the employees’ indefinite strike which is set to enter the sixth day on Monday. Around 1.2 lakh transport corporation employees affiliated to the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation Employees’ League, which launched the strike on Wednesday to press for a pay hike, continue to stall the majority of services. They stood firm in the face of several arm-twisting tactics by STUs against protesting employees. According to data, 2,506 (about 15%) buses were operational across the state till Sunday evening. Officials said they plan to operate more buses on Monday. March pay only for those at workThese included dismissing trainee and probationary BMTC staff, transferring KSRTC employees, threatening to evict them from staff quarters, not releasing salaries for March, no work-no pay rule and insisting on a medical fitness report for employees above 55 years. The KSRTC on Sunday decided not to consider requests for inter-corporation transfers of employees who are instigating and threatening colleagues for strike. “Employees given such transfers have been warned they will be cancelled and they will be posted to their original place if they fail to report for duty immediately” said a KSRTC official. Meanwhile, KSRTC on Sunday decided to pay March salaries only for those at work. The protesting union has written to celebrities, including actors Darshan and Shivarajkumar, for their support which was criticised by transport minister and deputy CM Laxman Savadi. KSRTC will extend the validity of student and monthly passes due to the strike. As per data available, 2,506 buses were operational till 6pm on Sunday compared to 1,626 on Saturday. These included KSRTC (1,230), BMTC (294), NEKRTC (592) and NWKRTC (390). Officials plan to operate more schedules from Monday. “It’s not financially feasible to increase their salaries on par with 6th Pay Commission recommendations which would mean a 30% hike. We’re ready to give an 8% hike even though ridership has reduced drastically due to Covid-19,” said a transport department official. Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha president Kodihalli Chandrashekar, who is leading the strike, said: “Transport employees and their family members will demonstrate across the state on Monday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-stir-deadlock-continues-only-15-buses-on-road/articleshow/82023490.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Secretariat staffers suspended for failing in vaccine duties||GUNTUR: Guntur district collector Vivek Yadav has suspended administration secretaries in two wards of Guntur municipal corporation (GMC) for failing to make people take Covid-19 vaccine. Pidathala Latha (RTC Colony) and Sunkara Naga Durga (NSP Canal) were suspended for failing to discharge their vaccination duties. The ward secretariat staffers say there is an attempt to put pressure on field staff to reach vaccine targets. While taking the jab is voluntary, targeting ward secretariat staff without giving a memo or show-cause notice shows the authoritative attitude of the senior officials, said a ward secretariat employee. According to sources, the collector took the action based on numbers shown on the vaccine dashboard. Senior officials were to monitor situation dailySources said he neither sought a report from the municipal commissioner nor an explanation from the staff. In both secretariats, only four people were inoculated in the first one week after the launch of the programme on February 1. Senior officials are working as nodal officers for ward secretariats and monitoring all government-run programmes, including Covid-19 vaccination. Surprisingly, no senior official was taken to task despite the fact it was their responsibility to motivate the ward secretariat staffers. The senior officials, including a joint collector, are to monitor the situation on a daily basis. The collector issued a similar directive to DMHO Dr Jasmine to take an undertaking from private hospitals that their staff were inoculated within a week, after the DMHO informed the collector that only 70 per cent of the healthcare workers in private sector has taken the jab. “The secretaries should have been given an opportunity by issuing a memo instead of suspension,” said YSRC general secretary L Appireddy. He said the vaccination is voluntary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-secretariat-staffers-suspended-for-failing-in-vaccine-duties/articleshow/82023478.cms||MN Samdani

Rao had filed his nomination on March 17 and campaigned for three days before he fell sick after participating in a cadre meeting on March 20. He was admitted to a private hospital in Madurai after testing positive for the infection. On Saturday, his condition deteriorated and he was admitted to the hospital’s intensive care unit. He died on Sunday morning. State chief electoral officer Satyabrata Sahoo said a byelection would follow if Madava Rao emerges victorious on May 2. Political leaders condole Rao’s deathHailing from Watrap in Virudhunagar district, Madava Rao was a Congress member since 1986. He was also a legal consultant and dealer of petroleum products who was testing the electoral waters for the first time after unsuccessfully seeking a seat several times earlier. He was affiliated to National Students Union of India and served as its state secretary, vice-president of Tamil Nadu Youth Congress and as adviser to the legal wing of the party. After he fell sick, it was his Chennai-based daughter M Divya Rao who campaigned for Madhava Rao, sometimes with her eight-month-old daughter. Meanwhile, videos of Rao campaigning without a mask during his campaign are being circulated in social media. Congress leader Peter Alphonse, while condoling the death, said all those involved in public life should take all necessary precautions to prevent the spread of the disease. Leaders across the political spectrum have condoled Rao’s death. They included DMK president M K Stalin, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and MDMK leader Vaiko. Congress Tamil Nadu incharge Sanjay Dutt said he was pained to learn about the sad demise of Madhava Rao. TNCC president K S Alagiri said the party had lost a very dedicated cadre who was expected to emerge victorious. He said Rao had asked for a seat in earlier elections too, but was denied. It was unfortunate that finally, when he was allotted one, he was not around to secure it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-srivilliputhur-congress-candidate-madava-rao-63-dies-of-covid-19/articleshow/82023523.cms||---

The state last crossed the figure on August 30,2020. Chennai continued to report the maximum number of new cases (2,124) and deaths (12), with 15,761 cases currently active in the district. With 22 people succumbing to the infection in 24 hours, the state’s death toll increased to 12,909 — second highest in the country after Maharashtra (57,638). Twenty of the 22 victims had comorbidities such as diabetes or hypertension. Tamil Nadu had targeted to vaccinate 1.3 crore people since inception of the drive on January 16, but as on Sunday, only 37,80,070 have been vaccinated across 4,328 centres. On Sunday, 47,205 people got their shots. At present, there are 41,955 Covid-19 patients undergoing treatment across the state. Cases on rise in city’s neighbouring districtsWith 2,314 people walking out of home quarantine or being discharged from hospitals in one day, TN’s recovery rate has dropped from 98% in March 1, to 97.66% on April 1 to 95.78% to 94.5% on Sunday. At present, there are 41,955 Covid-19 patients undergoing treatment across the state, and beds in government hospitals are getting occupied fast. Of the 4,300-odd beds in five major government hospitals in Chennai including the Rajiv Gandhi GH and Omandurar hospital, around 2,300 were occupied by Covid-19 patients, according to official data. Though Marina was out of bounds for visitors in the city, Royapuram fish market was overcrowded. Welfare camps set up by political parties in the city were no exceptions, either. Cases were on the rise in Chennai’s neighbouring districts of Chengalpattu (631), Kancheepuram (206) and Thiruvallur (296). Following Chennai and Chengalpattu, Coimbatore (617 ) stood third in the state’s daily infection chart. As a result, checks have been intensified at the interstate border with Kerala (Walayar) in the district. In other road borders, railway stations, ports and airports too, covid teams were deployed to collect samples of suspected cases. So far, 38.8 lakh people were screened before entry into the state and 7,446 had tested positive. In Madurai (173) and Trichy (154), the cases have grown by an average of at least 0.5% over the past two weeks. In central and northern Tamil Nadu, too, the situation has turned worse. At least 16 districts have reported 100 cases or more.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/after-7-months-new-tamil-nadu-cases-cross-6000-2124-infections-in-chennai-on-sunday/articleshow/82023540.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh daily Covid count surges close to 6,000||BHOPAL: After five consecutive days of 4,000-plus cases, Madhya Pradesh was holding its breath for it to breach the 5k mark, but what turned out on Sunday was a bigger shock — nearly 6,000 new infections. Sunday’s Covid count of 5,939 was the 10th consecutive day of a new high every day. A whopping 40,088 new cases have been reported in the past 10 days. What’s more worrying, the positivity rate is rising every day, shooting up to 15% on Sunday. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Sunday said that ‘Corona curfew’ may be imposed in cities to prevent the spread of the pandemic in the state. There will be no statewide lockdown, he assured. “Lockdown is not the solution to the Coronavirus crisis. We also have to keep economic activities going. Impromptu Corona curfew is the most effective solution,” he said. Local ‘crisis management groups’ in the districts will take the decision in this regard after discussions with the public, according to local conditions. The ‘Corona curfew’ may be clamped without warning. Chouhan said there are adequate beds and oxygen for treatment of Corona patients in all districts. On Sunday, 250 beds were increased in Hamidia Hospital in Bhopal, and RKDF hospital was contracted for Covid treatment. Discussions are on with other hospitals as well. The CM said that supply of Remdesivir injections to hospitals is being ensured. “About 4,000 injections have already arrived and 10,000 more will come by Sunday,” he said. Private hospitals are also linked up with the manufacturers. A slew of measures have been taken in the past few days to rein in the Covid pandemic, the CM said. “Now, the number of positive cases will drop gradually. With public support, we will overcome Corona,” Chouhan said at a review meeting. Over 21,860 units of Remdesivir arrived in Madhya Pradesh on Sunday, bringing a surge of hope to the thousands who have been waiting desperately for it. The injections were distributed in various districts. The drug inspector has been told to ensure there is no black-marketing or overcharging. About 244 metric tonnes of oxygen is being made available daily in the state, which is almost equal to the demand, said government officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-daily-covid-count-surges-close-to-6000/articleshow/82023542.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Covid hits politicians hard after a gruelling campaign amid crowds||CHENNAI: The restrictions imposed by the state government from Saturday to arrest the spread of the Covid pandemic's second wave looks like a case of bolting the stable door after the horse had bolted. The death of Madhava Rao, the Congress party candidate for Srivilliputtur on Sunday, days after the recently concluded April 6 assembly election, is a stark case that highlighted the woes of the politicians amidst the pandemic. On Sunday, BJP's Aravakurichi candidate K Annamalai too tested positive and has been hospitalized. Prior to him, it was DMK general secretary and candidate from Katpadi S Durai Murugan. He was joined soon by Congress Sriperumbudur candidate Selvaperunthagai. Former DMK minister and party candidate from Kurinjipadi, M R K Panneeraselvam was missing from the campaign scene too due to Covid, as also a few others from other parties. "While AICC general secretary in-charge for TN and Puducherry, Dinesh Gundu Rao and other leaders were shuttling between a Chennai hotel and Anna Arivalayam, the DMK headquarters, for finalizing seats, a large number of Congress aspirants for tickets were huddled together for days spending several hours a day in the lobby," sources in the party recalled. "When Madhava Rao spoke to me before leaving for Srivilliputtur, I felt something amiss in his voice, he said he had cold. I advised him to undertake a Covid test immediately. He promised to do it the next day,” said senior Congress leader Peter Alphonse, who himself was admitted to hospital after testing positive. “But on reaching there, he seemed to have got busy with workers’ meeting and other things. Had he undertaken the test early, he could have been alive today. Unfortunately, in an election, it is only the victory that matters for a candidate and everything else becomes secondary," said Alphonse. Not just Peter Alphonse, TNCC president K S Alagiri, veteran CPI leader Nallakannu and DMK women's wing secretary Kanimozhi too had tested positive, prior to and during the campaign. DMK had planned a last push campaign with her in Coimbatore, but Kanimozhi was hospitalized two days before the official campaign ended. "I think I picked up Covid, when I participated in an advocates meeting addressed by Rahul Gandhi at Tuticorin. After the meeting, several of my junior advocates, who were seeing me after ages, wanted to take selfies with me and asked me to remove the mask, " said Alphonse. "For politicians like us, we are risking our lives to stay on course. The health becomes a natural victim, " said K S Alagiri, who too was a Covid victim much before the campaign. "The craze for selfies is becoming a dangerous game play for leaders, especially in a party like our’s, where we cannot ask functionaries to keep a distance. In addition, the lensmen and television cameramen from the media force us to remove the masks. I even taunted them saying - am I participating in a beauty pageant. But it was to no avail, " said Alagiri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-covid-hits-politicians-hard-after-a-gruelling-campaign-amid-crowds/articleshow/82023563.cms||D Govardan
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: As people battle Covid & lockdown, dead wait for space in crematoriums||BHOPAL: While the population in the state capital is battling a surge in Covid-19 cases and lockdown, the dead and their kin are crying for a decent cremation. In the second wave of pandemic, with Covid-19 deaths surging along with natural deaths, crematoriums are flooded and every inch of space including the walkways outside the sheds and the park are being used to set up pyres. On Sunday, the Subhash Nagar crematorium presented a horrific sight, not witnessed since the Bhopal Gas Disaster days. The eerie silence at the crematorium was broken every 15 to 20 minutes with the chants of “Ram Nam Satya Hai…” and arrival of a new body being carried by dozens of people. In a span of two hours, during the noon hours eight non-Covid bodies came in, while ambulances rolled in with four Covid bodies. Ambulances waited with the bodies while the kin accompanying the non-Covid bodies waited for their turn along the roadside looking for every inch of space available for setting up pyre. Space in the dedicated sheds between two pyres were used and people waited with bodies to let one group complete the last rites, so that they can move in and take over the adjoining space. A sudden rise with 15 to 20 Covid deaths and about 15-20 natural deaths daily in the last few days, resulting in average daily cremations to 35-40 daily has taken a huge toll on the facilities and stock of wood. By afternoon, there was a shortage of wood and ‘Go Casth’ (planks made of cow dung and husk) was the only available alternate to light the pyre. By evening about 19 Covid bodies and another 16 non-Covid bodies were cremated. Shobhraj Sukhwani, manager of the Subhash Nagar Vishram Ghat Trust, told TOI he has also not seen the crematorium flooded so much after the Bhopal Gas disaster of 1984. He admitted there was a shortage of wood as about 175 quintals that arrived on Saturday were almost exhausted by afternoon on Sunday. Two truckloads are being arranged from Raisen by the forest department, till they arrive there will be crisis. Sameer Lakkad, who accompanied the body of his family friend’s mother said, “it is a nightmarish scene, unimaginable. People have been telling us about such horror stories, but one has to be here to understand the gravity of the situation.” A caretaker, who assists in cremation, wishing anonymity told TOI, “it is a difficult situation. There is no sanitization and cleanliness where we dispose the Covid bodies. The trust is doing it on its own, but the Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) is silent. They should at least sanitise and sweep the area. We all go there and work under great risk. The trust does provide us masks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-as-people-battle-covid-lockdown-dead-wait-for-space-in-crematoriums/articleshow/82023554.cms||Prakash Pillai

The past 10 days have seen an increase of 50% in day by day positivity rate — positivity rate is the number of people found positive out of every 100 samples tested — from 10.4 on April 2 to 15.1on April 11. This is despite the number of tests conducted per day has also increased during the said period. While 26514 tests were conducted on April 2, a total of 39288 tests were conducted on April 11. This clearly indicates the gravity of the situation, because as per norms, positivity rate above 5% is also considered high and higher number of tests are recommended so that it comes down. But despite increase in tests, more people were found positive out of every 100 samples tested. Both these indicators showing the intensity of infection number of new cases reported everyday as well as the positivity rate has been on a rise since April 2. April 2 was the day which had broken the record of previous year when highest number of cases were reported in a single day on September 18, 2020 when 2552 people were found positive. Since April 2, each day came with new highs in terms of infections and close to 6000 cases—5939 to be precise—were reported in the state on April 11. Sources said that more worrying is the fact that, there has been a significant increase in the number of active cases which has crossed 35000 mark. As on April 11, there are 35316 active cases in the state which is an all-time high. Even on the peak of Covid-19 cases in September last year, there were around 21000 active cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/40000-covid-cases-in-10-days-in-mp-50-rise-in-positivity/articleshow/82023575.cms||Amarjeet Singh

He also said that state-wide lockdown will not be imposed. Chouhan said that lockdown is not the solution to Coronavirus crisis. “We also have to keep economic activities going on. To prevent the spread of Covid-19 infection, the public is being made aware so that they themselves do not leave the house without work. The impromptu ‘Covid curfew’ is the most effective solution,” he said. Local Crisis Management Groups will take decisions at district-level in this regard after discussion with the public and according to local situations, he said. Chouhan said that there are adequate beds and oxygen supply for treatment of Covid-19 patients in the state. As many as 250 beds are being increased in Hamidia hospital Bhopal and RKDF hospital is also being contracted for treatment of Covid-19 patients. Discussions are on with other hospitals as well, he said. The chief minister said that supply of Remdesivir injections to hospitals is being ensured and 4000 injections have already arrived and 10,000 more will arrive on Monday.

Police on Sunday arrested Sasikumar, 19, with the help of CCTV camera footage and remanded him in judicial custody a week after the fatal attack. M Shankar, who was returning back to his rented house at Valarmathi Nagar in Kolathur from Tiruvannamalai on April 4, got down at the Koyambedu bus terminus late in the night. He hitch-hiked with V Sasi Kumar, who, incidentally, was also from Kolathur. After dropping Shankar near his house, Sasi Kumar demanded Rs 100 for petrol expense. According to police, Shankar refused to pay up, saying if he had Rs 100 he would have taken an autorickshaw. CCTV footage nails city’s killer bikerBut Sasikumar refused to let Shankar go, and in a fit of rage, allegedly hit Shankar and pushed him to the ground. Shankar fell unconscious and Sasi Kumar took a Rs 100 note from his pocket and fled the spot. Passersby noticed Shankar’s body and alerted police who sent it for postmortem. While a case of suspicious death was registered, CCTV footages sourced from the neighbourhood revealed that Shankar was riding pillion on a two-wheeler. Investigation revealed that the bike belonged to Sasi Kumar’s father Velu. After questioning, Sasi Kumar confessed to his crime. According to police, Sasi Kumar, who was using his dad’s bike, would be admonished by him if he empties the tank. So, he was looking for ?100 to refill the tank, and offered the ride only to get the money. “He, however, did not tell Shankar about his fee when he gave him the lift. He demanded money only after dropping him and a fight broke out,” a police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-hitchhike-turns-fatal-for-man-who-refused-to-pay-rs-100/articleshow/82023595.cms||---

Towards the evening, some vehicles appeared on the road. However, policemen guarding the barricades and picket points didn’t seem inclined to ask any questions to commuters as many thronged the streets for essential food items. At some places, particularly slum areas, children could be seen playing cricket outside their houses while men and women sitting outside and talking in groups. Some medical shops were open and petrol pumps, too, but people manning those shops and petrol pumps unlike the normal days seemed waiting for customers. “Even during lockdown last year, people would keep trickling in for fuel but today, we are seven people on duty but there are hardly any customers,” said manager of a petrol pump, who was sitting among the vendors. Areas under Kolar and Shahpura, which are under lockdown till April 19, wore a similar looks. Deserted roads, some medical shops open and the entire area under the vigilant eyes of police. The areas have been barricaded in a manner that even vehicles engaged in emergency services or those coming out in case of an emergency have to look for alternate ways to get to their destination. While police have barricaded areas under lockdown, the posh Char Imli colony has been barricaded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/lockdown-2021-stricter-than-last-year-covid-fear-keeps-bhopal-roads-deserted/articleshow/82023616.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

The city will also witness the incorporation of more containment zones in the coming days. “Our teams are monitoring the areas where there are more cases. Over 90% of the cases are in highrises. We will revise the containment zone list. At present, the city has 61 containment zones, which are expected to rise to 100 soon,” said Yadav.

---||Ahmedabad||HC initiates suo motu PIL over Covid health emergency in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: On a day when Gujarat recorded its highest ever 54 Covid deaths on Sunday, the Gujarat high court Chief Justice Vikram Nath filed suo motu PIL over “uncontrolled upsurge and gross management issues in Covid-19 control” in the state with the observation that news reports indicate the state is “heading towards a health emergency of sorts”. The hearing is posted on Monday before the bench of Justice Nath and Justice Bhargav Karia. The suo motu PIL comes on heels of the HC's failed request to the state government to impose short lockdown to control the Covid-19 situation which is going from “bad to worse”. In an order, the CJ cited various news reports and said, “Newspapers and news channels are flooded with harrowing tales, unfortunate and unimaginable difficulties, unmanageable conditions of the infrastructure, the shortfall and the deficit of not only testing, availability of beds, ICU, but also supply of oxygen and the basic medicines like Remdesivir, etc. It is the time that the court must intervene.” ‘Virus mutation causing Covid surge’Over a year into the pandemic, the situation seems to be turning from bad to worse in Gujarat. Of the highest ever 54 deaths recorded in a day, 38 or 70% deaths were recorded in Ahmedabad (20) and Surat (18) districts.In the past two days, the state lost 103 patients. To put the figure in perspective, from January 1to April 9, Gujarat had recorded deaths of 99 patients. In Surat, kin of Covid-19 victims resorted to spraying diesel and kerosene instead of traditional ghee on the pyres for faster burning of bodies. Dry wood has become scarce due to the flood of dead at crematoriums and green logs don't burn fully. “I know this is disrespectful but we are helpless. There is waiting for cremating Covid-19 dead and green wood does not burn fully if inflammable is not used," said Arjun Patel, a resident of Udhna. Dr Maharshi Desai, critical care specialist and member of the state-appointed Covid-19 task force, said mortality rate is same or slightly higher compared to the last surge in wake of a huge number of positive cases. “Mortality continues to be higher in the age group of 45 and 70 years and people with comorbidities," he said. Recently, the task force members said virus mutation has rendered it both more infectious and virulent. Experts noted early onset of severity and higher infection rate among the working population (25 to 60 years). "Many are reporting relatively higher viral load compared to earlier two waves experienced by Gujarat," they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-initiates-suo-motu-pil-over-covid-health-emergency-in-gujarat/articleshow/82023734.cms||---

Before carrying out the survey, officials will have to undergo training at the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) in Dehradun from Monday. The field survey is likely to begin after three weeks. The survey will assess the presence of major wildlife species in the Aravalis and the Shivaliks, especially leopards and other predators. “The training for the survey will begin on Monday. Districts such as Hisar, Rohtak and Gurgaon will be part of the programme. A team of four officials from WII will provide technical knowhow to officials of the wildlife department for carrying out the study,” said Rajesh Chahal, the wildlife inspector in Gurgaon. The three-week training programme will include sessions on methodology, scope and execution pattern. The field survey will be conducted in the first week of May in all protected areas, national parks, sanctuaries and other zones of the Aravalis and the Shivaliks. Apart from preparing a report on the density of the wildlife population, the officials will also map the land cover pattern in the Aravalis. “The survey will cost Rs 40 lakh. WII is already seeking scientists and field researchers for this survey. It will constitute a team for this purpose,” said ML Rajvanshi, chief conservator of wildlife in Haryana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/wildlife-survey-to-start-in-aravalis/articleshow/82021857.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Gurgaon||Residents plan to meet minister over power security deposit on Monday||Gurgaon: The decision to impose advance consumption deposit (ACD) charges on consumers taken by Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) on the direction of Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission (HERC) has not gone down well with the residents, who are planning to meet power minister Ranjit Singh Chautala on Monday and seek his intervention. According to the residents, DHBVN recently announced that all active consumers will have to pay an advance security amount, which is equal to two average billing cycles in the financial year. “Last year due to the pandemic, we postponed the review. It is a regular process as ACD is reviewed annually as per the instruction of HERC. Earlier, advance security amount deposited by consumers at the time of new connection and enhancement of load capacity was sufficient but now the consumption has increased manifold which is why HERC has made it mandatory to review the ACD annually based on the average billing for the previous financial year and any excess and deficient amount is being adjusted in the bills,” said a senior official of DHBVN. “My actual electricity consumption for the period of two months is of Rs 3,958 but the discom has added Rs 15,212 as other non-energy charges. As per the norm we have already paid the security amount at the time of getting connection then why charge us unreasonably,” said SN Sharma, a resident of Sector 9A. “Electricity bills have come as a shock. The government should consider Covid-19 situation and avoid putting any additional financial burden on consumers. Many families already are having a hard time making ends meet,” said Lalit Suraj Bhola, general secretary of Sector 9A RWA. “These additional charges are not at all justified as we have already deposited the security amount to the electricity department. Our source of income has badly been affected due to the pandemic. Despite unjustified charges, we are still facing power cuts, voltage fluctuation on a regular basis,” said Karamvir Yadav, a resident of Sector 45. Meanwhile, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday said that the government is planning to propose to take charges in four instalments to facilitate the residents and may also pass the interest benefit of advanced security amount to consumers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/residents-plan-to-meet-minister-over-power-security-deposit-on-monday/articleshow/82021845.cms||Akanksha Gupta
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Marketing firm ex-CEO, five more booked for fraud||GURUGRAM: A city-based digital marketing company Arshiya Info Solutions Private Limited has filed a complaint against their former chief executive officer (CEO) and five other people for forming another business entity that offers similar services and asking clients to divert the ongoing businesses to the new firm. According to Arshiya officials, the former CEO had joined the company in July 2017. In a year, he built is own team by bringing in five more people, who were eventually made board of directors in the firm. The group of six, allegedly made a strategy, and convinced the organisation to spend a large amount of their budget on a single Europe-based client. In 2019, as per the complaint, the six men, including the CEO, started their own company and allegedly influenced the European client to transfer his deal to their new company. When Arshiya conducted an internal investigation, it found that several of its clients were approached by the former CEO and asked to divert their businesses to the new company. “It may be observed that our former CEO hatched a conspiracy of doing fraud and had taken a year’s time to execute his plan along with his accomplices. They had also made changes in the complainant company’s agreement with the clients and stole data and business sensitive information by illegally using the complainant company’s codes, intellectual property and assets, etc for personal gains and causing financial loss,” said the complaint, a copy of which TOI has accessed. An FIR has been registered under sections 420 (fraud) and 408 (criminal breach of trust) of the IPC and Section 66 of the IT Act which states that if any person, dishonestly or fraudulently, does any act referred to in Section 43, he shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine which may extend to Rs 5 lakh or both.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/marketing-firm-ex-ceo-5-more-booked-for-fraud/articleshow/82021867.cms||---

According to the buyers, since its launch in 2016, only 50% of the work has been completed. The units were supposed to be ready by May this year and then the deadline was extended to November 2021. But on Sunday, the buyers were told that the deadline has been extended to June 2022. On Sunday, developer’s representatives Arun Yadav and Sanjeev Kumar met about 150 buyers at the project site. Asked about the deadline, the officials said it is June 2022, as per government norms. They, however, did not comment on the delay or why bouncers were present on Sunday. Pankaj Kumar, who had booked a flat in May 2017, said: “It’s been almost four years but hardly 40-50% work is done. The developer has taken 90-100% payment from all buyers. We are paying rent as well as instalments for our home loans.” Launched in October 2016, the project on 7.5 acres has over 1,000 units, each in the range of Rs 14 to 26 lakh. The developer, Ocean Seven Buildtech (OSB) Group, had initially promised possession in May 2021. But the construction was stopped around 18 months back. The buyers have alleged that the builder has restricted their entry and told them to visit the site only on Saturdays and Sundays after getting prior approval. “In August last year, they promised us that the work will resume in September. Then they said it will start after Diwali. Last month we were told the work will restart in March itself. But that has not happened,” Kumar said. The homebuyers said they have complained on several platforms, including the CM window. But no action has been taken. Homebuyer Mahipal Singh said: “Several complaints have been made on the CM window and also with H-Rera. But there has been no positive development.” A group of buyers has now written to Badshapur MLA Rakesh Daultabad requesting him to take up the matter with the department of town and country planning and initiate action against the developer. Shreya Sachan, who has also booked a flat, said: “We are suffering because of the delay and paying both rent and loan money for months now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/20-bouncers-in-tow-builder-tells-buyers-project-delayed/articleshow/82021870.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh

Sidhana, who is wanted by Delhi Police for instigating violence during the farmers’ tractor rally at Red Fort on the Republic Day, has slammed the police action and accused the Punjab Police of failing to protect the citizens of the state. In a social media post on Sunday morning, Sidhana demanded that Punjab Police take action against their Delhi counterparts for picking up an innocent person just because he is related to him and beating him mercilessly. Terming it as a failure of the Punjab Police in protecting the residents of the state, he also asked them to lodge a strong protest with Delhi Police for picking up a resident of Punjab without informing them. Gurdeep, a resident of Sidhana village in Bathinda had gone to Patiala to take an exam when he was picked by cops. In his statement to police, he said he had boarded a train from Rampura railway station on April 8 and reached Patiala around 7.15 pm. He said his friend Gurpreet Singh picked him up from the railway station and while on their way to the Punjabi University, they were stopped near the Urban Estate by the Delhi Police Special Cell personnel. He said the cops forced them to sit in their vehicle, blindfolded them and took them to Janakpuri police station in New Delhi, where he was tortured. The next day, cops dropped them at the Ambala bus stand, from where they reached Patiala and spent a night at Gurpreet’s residence. They reached Sidhana the next day, where the village panchayat got him admitted to the civil hospital. Gurpreet has suffered multiple injuries in his legs and back from a blunt weapon. Bathinda SSP Bhupinderjit Singh Virk said, “Police have recorded Gurdeep’s statement. Further legal action, as required, would be taken on the completion of inquiries.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/lakha-sidhanas-cousin-picked-up-allegedly-by-delhi-cops/articleshow/82023743.cms||---

All government schools in Haryana will have to submit the survey report by April 20. Before the start of the new academic session, the department is planning to assess the status of the midday meal delivery in the state-run schools. For this, the department has tasked the school heads and teachers to carry out the extensive survey. “The survey is to assess the status of the midday meal programme. This is primarily a feedback-based exercise where the department has released a set questionnaire and schools will have to note the responses of parents and teachers on these queries. This will not only help us evaluate how schools are faring in terms of ensuring of delivering clean, healthy, and hygienic dry ration but also help us revise the menu and recipes based on the suggestions received from the students and parents,” said an education department official. The department has released a list of questionnaires in the form of Google documents. Teachers will have to note responses of the parents and students on the quality of food provided, adequacy of the meal to fulfil nutrition requirements, hygiene standards, among others parameters and indicators. The survey will also take feedback fro parents and students on the quality of meals provided to them and if they have any specific demands to change the recipes. Teachers will have to submit a comprehensive report on the status of midday meals in their schools by April 20. The report will also have to elaborate on the complaints received from the students about the midday meal. “We have discussed the survey format with the teachers and gave the necessary directions to complete this at the earliest. The major focus of this survey is to see whether or not schools are following proper cleanliness and hygiene norms to distribute healthy and nutritional food to the students. The survey also aims at identifying that what kind of meals students prefer so that necessary changes can be made in the daily routine of midday meal rationing. Also, as students are getting dry ration during the pandemic, the survey aims to take feedback from parents and students if they are getting adequate and unadulterated ration,” said Manoj Lakhra, head of Bajgheda Government School. The survey will also evaluate if the schools have sufficient clean utensils to cook and serve food to the students, how often block education and district education officers come for inspection and whether students have safe drinking water facilities and practice WHO-recommended hand-washing techniques. Teachers, however, have complained that they presently overburdened with work and such a short window to complete the survey will further wear them out. “Final exams have just concluded so there’ll be checking of answer sheets and uploading the results on the SAT. Thereafter, we have to find out how many students were excluded from online exams and make arrangements for them to take exams. Board exams are beginning in the next few days. We should be given more time if the department expects quality inputs on the proposed survey, otherwise, teachers will have to just rush into it and will not be able to take it as seriously as it should be taken,” said a government school teacher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/schools-to-take-parents-feedback-on-midday-meals/articleshow/82021963.cms||Siddharth Tiwari

Chairing a review meeting, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said night curfew should be imposed in districts which are reporting 100 cases daily or have 500 active cases. Besides, the order to restrict the number of devotees to five at a time at religious places was extended to all 75 districts. It was announced only for Lucknow on Saturday. While the state capital recorded the highest 4,444 coronavirus cases, followed by Varanasi (1,740), Prayagraj (1,656) and Kanpur (881). At least 67 people succumbed to coronavirus infection in the past 24 hours, with Lucknow registering maximum 31 deaths. The state has 71,241 active cases with Lucknow leading the tally with 20,195. The health department conducted 2,03,780 tests in 24 hours. Later in the evening, chief secretary RK Tewari issued a government order announcing further restrictions to control the surge. Retail shops to be allowed to operate from 7am to 7pmThe order said that in case of an enclosed area not more than 50 people, or 50% of the capacity of the area, will be allowed to assemble while following Covid protocols, including the use of facemask, sanitizer and social distancing. Likewise, in case of open spaces, 50% of the capacity or up to 100 people would be allowed while following Covid-19 protocol. “Retail shops will be allowed to operate from 7am to 7pm. District authorities may also deploy mobile units to facilitate doorstep delivery,” the chief secretary said. Earlier, taking stock of the steps to check coronavirus spread, the CM directed the officials to trace at least 30-35 people who come in contact with an infected person. “Efforts should be made to meet the objective of test, trace and treat. At least one lakh RTPCR tests should be conducted daily to identify people who have contracted infection. Rigorous testing should be done at airports, railways and bus stations,” he said. On Saturday, the government had announced restrictions on gatherings of five or more people at religious places for effective control of Covid pandemic during Navratri and Ramzan. Yogi said officials of various departments should be engaged in management of Covid as per requirement. The CM said special attention should be given to Lucknow, Kanpur, Varanasi and Prayagraj and asked officials to ensure that each Covid hospital has at least 700 beds and other necessary facilities. This comes a day after the state government announced conversion of Era’s Medical College, TS Mishra Medical College and Integral Medical College into dedicated Covid hospitals. The CM directed the authorities to ensure adequate availability of oxygen in Covid hospitals. “Ventilators and high flow nasal cannulas should be arranged in adequate numbers in L2 and L3 hospitals. PPE kits, N-95 masks, pulse oximeters, sanitizers and infrared thermometers are provided in districts,” he said. Yogi asked the urban and rural development departments to carry out sanitization on a mission mode. “This will not only help the state government control coronavirus but also other diseases like dengue, malaria, chikungunya and Japanese encephalitis,” he said. Meanwhile, the government has also decided to regulate local mandis in a way to avoid crowding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-registers-a-new-high-of-15-3k-covid-19-cases-all-schools-shut-till-april-30/articleshow/82023800.cms||Pankaj Shah

Residents have lodged multiple complaints with the administration. A crackdown follows and the shops are sealed, but most of them are back in business after a few months, they alleged. In 2018, the Federation of Apartment Owners’ Association had filed a petition in the Allahabad high court, seeking action against such illegal commercial units. They alleged in the petition that a number of private banks, beauty parlours, cafes, gyms, restaurants, departmental stores and clinics could be found operating out of the premises of residential townships in Ahimsa Khand, Nyay Khand, Gyan Khand and Shakti Khand areas. “These commercial units have not only encroached on the pavements, but they are one of the main reasons for traffic snarls. When repeated complaints to authorities did not yield any result, we had to move court. Some action was taken by the authorities, but the situation is back to square one,” said Alok Kumar of FedAOA. Citing the Ghaziabad Development Authority’s bylaws, Kumar said the rules allowed only five convenience shops for every 1,000 population within the society’s premises. “But builders, particularly in Indirapuram area, have allowed many more shops to be built on their premises. This is violation of building bylaws,” he added. According to a survey, parking along convenience shops on Kala Patthar Road occupies 450 car spaces at any time. GDA vice-chairperson Krishna Karunesh said he was aware of the problem and promised action against any such illegal commercial unit within 15 days. “The issue has been raised by residents time and again. We have been chalking out plans to end this menace. To start with, we are preparing a list of such establishments in the township. In the next 15 days, we will carry out a major operation,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/illegal-shops-causing-snarls-in-indirapuram/articleshow/82021962.cms||Abhijay Jha

It is laden with drumsticks that hand from its branches all over the region. It is the time of the year when its fruit ripens and the ‘sweet’ smell of its flowers covers the parks and roads with fresh aroma. Pradip Krishen, in his book ‘Trees of Delhi’, has described the tree as “graceful...with softwood having an airy crown of fern-like foliage and generous clusters of creamy white highly-scented flowers.” The tree is native to the southern foothills of Himalaya but is also found in the foothills of Aravalis. The drumstick trees can reach a height of about 9 metre. They have corky gray bark and fern-like leaves. These trees grow fast and are suitable for humid and hot temperatures. The plant is ideal for Aravalis as watering is not an issue since it is characterised as a ‘drought-resistant’ plant. Its seeds are a source of oil, which is used for cooking and lubrication. The leaves are extensively used as a vegetable in many parts of the world and the root can be made into a condiment similar to horseradish. The bark, sap, roots, leaves, seeds and flowers are used in traditional medicine. The leaves can be used in the diet of the obese as they have a low calorific value. Moringa powder can be used as a substitute of iron tablets for treatment of anaemia. Leaf extract is used to treat malnutrition and augment breast milk in lactating mothers. “Drumstick tree is a native to Himalayan foothills but is grown widely in gardens and fields for its food properties. It should be planted more in parks due to its importance for birds and insects. People also eat the drumsticks as a vegetable,” said Ghazala Shahabuddin, ecologist and senior fellows at CEDAR, Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/miracle-tree-from-aravalis-is-a-key-source-of-food-for-birds/articleshow/82021959.cms||Ipsita Pati

Presiding over the meeting, the governor lauded CM Yogi Adityanath’s proactive approach in handling the situation arising out of sudden increase in number of people being infected by Covid-19. She said the CM was visiting different districts to take a first- hand stock of the preparations on ground, something that has not been happening in other states.CM Yogi, addressing the meeting, said the state government was committed to protect both the lives and livelihood of the common man. BSP leader Lalji Verma, while thanking the state government for convening the all-party meet this time, assured his party’s full support to the government’s guidelines on Covid safety protocols. He said BSP chief Mayawati has asked party functionaries to follow directives of the state government. Verma complimented the Yogi government for its effective handling of the Covid crisis so far. “I have also suggested that the government should increase the number of beds available for those suffering from Covid-19 infection. As the focus presently is on Covid, the government must make arrangements to ensure that the non-Covid patients are not neglected and get proper medical care,” he said talking to TOI. Similar views were shared by Congress leader Suhail Ansari. He said that his party expects the government and officials to control the current wave with the same success as was done during the first phase.

Yogi, who inspected the vaccination camp in the UP Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL), urged eligible people to get vaccinated and follow all Covid protocols, including social distancing and face masks, to ward off any chances of infection. The UP government organised the special vaccination campaign through 6,000 centres across the state. “This is part of the government effort to safeguard every individual against the virus,” he said. Vaccine is completely safe, says CMThe special campaign comes a day after Uttar Pradesh recorded over 12,700 fresh corona cases prompting the state government to put in place a slew of measures including restricting entry of more than five persons in places of worship and ramping up facilities in hospitals for Covid patients. “Every individual can be part of the campaign started by the government in its war against the pandemic. All eligible people should also wait for their turn to get vaccinated,” Yogi said, appealing the people to unite and abide by PM Modi’s call. He also allayed apprehension about the vaccine saying that it was completely safe. “But people need to take all kinds of precautions even after taking the vaccine. One need to remember that prevention is better than cure. It is only then that we all would be able to win the battle against corona,” he said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had asked the state governments to carry out an exhaustive vaccination drive by organising a four-day ‘Tika Utsav’ starting from Sunday, which happened to be the birth anniversary of 19th century anti-caste social reformer Jyotiba Phule till April 14, the birth anniversary of Dalit icon and father of Indian Constitution BR Ambedkar. According to Dr.Rakesh Dubey, director general, Family Welfare, 28.2 lakh people have taken their dose of vaccine in just 10 days of April.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/special-vaccination-drive-begins-at-6000-centres-across-up/articleshow/82023848.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Spiralling Covid grips 4,500, snuffs out 31 lives in a day||LUCKNOW: The Covid-19 surge is becoming deadlier in the city with each passing day. It claimed 31 more lives and infected close to 4,500 more persons in the past 24 hours, catapulting the number of patients with active infection to 20,195 on Sunday. All the figures were the highest ever recorded in the 13 months of the pandemic so far. Several times more transmissible and virulent than the first wave witnessed in August-September last year, the second wave of the pandemic that started on March 15 and turned exponential after Holi has infected 21,505 people and killed 122 patients in past 11 days, overwhelming testing, healthcare and funeral facilities alike. The bigger cause of concern, said experts, has been the massive hospitalisation and death rate. Till March, there were 2-3 casualties in a day, but now there are 2-3 dozen daily. In fact, the number of deaths on Saturday and Sunday (54) was almost two times of the total fatalities recorded in February and March. “Some families have lost more than one family member. Over 90% of the deaths were of people above 60 years or those with comorbidities like diabetes and heart disease in the 40-60 years age group. People in these groups must get themselves vaccinated as it will prevent critical illness and thus save their lives,” said a senior KGMU professor. An RMLIMS professor pointed out that of the total active cases in the city at present, nearly 2,000 are in hospitals. Of these, nearly 1,100 are serious or critical. “This means that more valuable lives could be lost in coming days. The daily cases may skyrocket to 10,000 by next week, if people will not religiously follow safety protocols, he added As the spike in the transmission rate has also made the city corona hotspot of the state, on Sunday, every third infection and second death in UP took place in Lucknow. It has also taken the city’s tally to 1.07 lakh since the outbreak of the pandemic last year in March. Of these, 85,885 (79.9%) have recovered, but 1332 (1.3%) could not survive. Meanwhile, the chief medical officer’s office and district administration continued to keep the details of the deaths and the areawise cases with the city under wraps.

---||World||China considering mixing Covid-19 vaccines to boost protection rate||BEIJING: China's top disease control official has said the country is formally considering mixing Covid-19 vaccines, as a way of further boosting vaccine efficacy. Available data shows Chinese vaccines lag behind others including Pfizer and Moderna in terms of efficacy, but require less stringent temperature controls during storage. The currently available vaccines "don't have very high rates of protection", Gao Fu, the director of the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a conference in the Chinese city of Chengdu on Saturday. "Inoculation using vaccines of different technical lines is being considered," he said. Gao said that taking steps to "optimise" the vaccine process including changing the number of doses and the length of time between doses was a "definite" solution to the efficacy issues. China has developed four domestic vaccines approved for public use and an official said on Saturday that the country will likely produce 3 billion doses by the end of the year. A Covid-19 vaccine developed by China's Sinovac was found to have an efficacy rate of slightly above 50% in Brazilian clinical trials. A separate study in Turkey said it was 83.5% effective. No detailed efficacy data has been released on vaccines made by China's Sinopharm. It has said two vaccines developed by its units are 79.4% and 72.5% effective respectively, based on interim results. Both vaccine makers have presented data on their Covid-19 vaccines indicating levels of efficacy in line with those required by the World Health Organization, a WHO panel said in March. China has shipped millions of its vaccines abroad, and officials and state media have fiercely defended the shots while calling into question the safety and logistics capabilities of other vaccines. "The global vaccine protection rate test data are both high and low," Gao told state tabloid Global Times on Sunday. "How to improve the protection rate of vaccines is a problem that requires global scientists to consider," Gao said, adding that mixing vaccines and adjusting immunisation methods are solutions that he had proposed. Gao also rejected claims by some media reports that he said Chinese Covid-19 vaccines have a low protection rate, telling Global Times that it was "a complete misunderstanding."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/china-considering-mixing-covid-19-vaccines-to-boost-protection-rate/articleshow/82023901.cms||---

The analysis of the state health department reveals that the positivity rate in the senior citizen population is highest among all the age groups while their share in testing is lowest. The positivity rate in this age category, which is the least mobility group has been progressively increasing amid the second wave of infection, calling for the need to increase testing in this age group. Punjab has the second the highest percentage of the population in the age group of 60 years and above in the country. 10.3% of Punjab’s population in category of senior citizensAccording to the ‘Elderly in India’ report compiled by the central statistics office, 10.3% of the state’s population is in the category of senior citizens. The elderly population accounted for 8.8% of total tests conducted in the state till April 3, while the group’s positivity rate stood at 11.1%. The age group from 0 to 30 years had a maximum share of 47.3% in testing with a positivity rate of 3.6%, while the positivity rate of 7.2% had been recorded in the age group of 31to 60 year having 43.9% share on overall testing. In March too, the positivity rate of this age group was higher than their share in testing. Against a share of 7.8% in testing, the group had a positivity rate of 12.1% — highest in any age category. The group comprising people in the age bracket of 31 to 60 years had the second highest positivity rate of 6.7% and their share in testing was 44.7%. The youngest age groups of o to 30 years had the lowest positivity rate of 3.7% and the highest share of 47.6% in testing. In January and February as well, the elderly population had the lowest share in testing and the highest positivity rate. However, in these two months, the positivity rate was lower than their share in testing. This age group also accounts for the majority of Covid deaths. Out of total deaths reported since January, over 30.2% were in the age group of 61 to 70 years and 29.8% in above 70 age bracket, 22.6% in 52 to 60 years, 12% in 41 to 50 years and 4% in 32 to 40 years and 1.4% in 15 to 30 years. Terming it as a matter of concern, Chandigarh-based Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (CRRID)’s Professor of population studies Aswini Kumar Nanda maintained that the positivity rate in Punjab has been consistently rising among 60 and above population, which is the most vulnerable age group. “This explains why Punjab has a high fatality rate,” said Nanda, who urged the state government to increase testing among the elderly population for timely detection, isolation, and treatment of infected individuals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/positivity-rate-among-elderly-in-punjab-higher-than-bit-in-testing/articleshow/82023939.cms||Vinod Kumar

After the second wave struck, the state reported 9,767 Covid cases and 112 deaths. Occupancy rate in Covid hospitals has also increased with increase in the number of patients. Many districts in the state are seeing clusters of cases emerging because of specific events and/or places where there is crowding or where a large number of people are in close physical contact, coupled with lack of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. As on April 9, bed occupancy in level II facilities in Himachal Pradesh was 27.9% as against the availability of 563 beds in dedicated covid health centres (DCHCs). A total of 157 beds were occupied.

About 100 people, some visibly upset and one carrying a sign declaring "Justice for George Floyd," confronted police in riot gear after an officer shot a man in his car in Brooklyn Center, a Minneapolis suburb. At one point, police fired rubber bullets, hitting at least two people in the crowd, and bloodying at least one, according to the Reuters witness. Some in the crowd dispersed as police appeared to be readying to use tear gas on protesters, although none was deployed. Police cars were pelted with stones and rocks, the witness said, while Twitter video from a Minneapolis Star Tribune reporter showed people jumping up and down on the hoods and roofs of the vehicles. The dead man was named by relatives on the scene as Daunte Wright, 20, according to the Star Tribune. In a news release, the Brooklyn Center Police Department said officers pulled over the driver for a traffic violation just before 2 pm, and ascertained he had an outstanding arrest warrant. As police tried to arrest him, he re-entered the vehicle. One officer fired their weapon, striking the driver, police said. The driver drove several blocks before striking another vehicle and died at the scene. Police say both the officers' body cameras were activated during the incident. Tensions in the Minneapolis area are extremely high as the murder trial of Derek Chauvin, a white former Minneapolis police officer captured on video kneeling for nine minutes on the neck of Floyd, a 46-year-old handcuffed Black man, enters its third week on Monday.

One Kanwaljeet Singh Batra lodged a complaint against 12 persons identified as Parth, Ajay, Vikram, Isham, Dharambir, Brahampal, Tejpal, Vishal, Kripal Singh, Dheeraj, Thath Singh and Sushil, and five to seven unknown others, all residents of Karhera village. All the 12 persons have been booked under sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 147 (punishment for rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly for common object), 341(wrongful restraint) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Jathlana police station on Saturday, April 10, 2021. In his police complaint, Kanwaljeet told the police that his firm, M/S Kanwaljeet Singh Batra took Model Town Karhera B-13 sand quarry on contract for seven years from the Haryana government. “Our firm started mining work on April 24, 2018. For the sand mining work, land was taken from farmers and gram panchayat of Model Town, Karhera on lease for the period of the mining contract. Payment of the same is given through cheques in advance every year. We have been paying farmers till date,” said Kanwaljeet. He alleged that some farmers were pressuring him to increase payments illegally. “Despite getting payment on their agreement, they had earlier lodged a case at the Jagadhri court as well as the Punjab and Haryana high court. In this case, as per the orders of the high court, the court of district magistrate, Yamunanagar, ruled that the contractor is giving correct and justified payments as per rules of the mining department, which should be more than 10% of the contract money per acre per year,” stated Kanwaljeet. “After this, farmers who had lodged the case obtained payments from the contractor firm and now, the same farmers are wrongly instigating other villagers and obstructing mining activities of the firm,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/yamunanagar-12-booked-for-obstructing-mining/articleshow/82023999.cms||JK Singh
