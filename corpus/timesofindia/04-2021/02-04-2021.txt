MobiKwik, which is backed by Sequoia Capital and Bajaj Finance, has faced growing criticism this week for denying a leak many customers and digital rights activists say is linked to the company’s database. The RBI was “not happy” with the company’s initial response and has asked it to act immediately, said the source, who declined to be named as the discussion between the RBI and the company was private. The payments firm has also faced backlash for threatening legal action against a security researcher who first flagged the breach. Several users said this week they had found information such as their credit card details on a leaked online database that allegedly belonged to MobiKwik, a claim the company has denied. “The RBI has given MobiKwik an ultimatum and ordered them to retain an external auditor to conduct a forensic audit,” said the person, adding the RBI could also impose fines if the breach is proven. The RBI did not respond to a request for comment. The central bank has the power to fine a payment systems provider a minimum of Rs 500,000 ($6,811) in such cases. MobiKwik did not respond to a request for comment and messages sent to its founders went unanswered. It has previously said users could have uploaded their data on several platforms and it was incorrect to say the leaked information was accessed from the payments company, adding it takes privacy and security very seriously. With 120 million users, MobiKwik competes in India with firms like Alibaba-backed Paytm and Google’s payments service, which have witnessed a rapid surge in usage. But data breaches and leaks have also become common in the country. On Wednesday, New Delhi-based digital rights group the Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) asked India’s country’s cyber security agency to probe the alleged data breach. The federal agency did not respond to Reuters queries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-orders-mobikwik-to-probe-alleged-data-leak-report/articleshow/81858618.cms||---

Higher imports by the world’s second-biggest bullion consumer could support benchmark gold prices, which have corrected nearly 17% from an all-time high of $2,072 in August 2020. The surge in imports could increase India’s trade deficit and pressure the rupee. India imported a record 321 tonnes in the March quarter, up from 124 tonnes a year ago, the source said. The source asked to remain anonymous since he is not authorised to speak to the media. In value terms, March imports surged to $8.4 billion from $1.23 billion a year ago, he said. In February, India slashed import duties on gold to 10.75% tax from 12.5% to boost retail demand and curtail smuggling into the South Asian country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/gold-imports-surge-471-to-a-record-160-tonnes-in-march-government-source/articleshow/81859103.cms||---

The 10th round match ended 2-2 after a late equaliser from Velsao’s Ronil Azavedo.  “We have played a match against Churchill Brothers on the 30th of March 2021, and would like to bring to your attention the following players from Churchill Brothers FC have been registered before the last two matches which is against the GFA Competition Rules,” Velsao secretary Terence Freitas wrote in his letter to the GFA.  Velsao have said three players – Bryce Miranda, Kingslee Fernandes and Shubert Pereira -- are all ineligible to play in the league. The trio were integral part of the Churchill side that finished runnerup in the I-League last week.  Kingslee and Shubert were in the starting 11 for Armando Colaco’s side while Bryce was on the bench and took the field in the second half.  As per rules sent by the association to all participating clubs before the start of the competition, “for tournament played on a single leg basis: No additional players can be registered for the last two rounds of the tournament.”  “Your response on the same will be highly appreciated and please forward us the 3 points,” Velsao demanded.  Velsao are fighting to stay afloat and are in ninth place in the standings with eight points. They are followed by Youth Club of Manora who are on seven points and have two games in hand.  Guardian Angel SC are 11th with seven points from nine games while Sesa FA are bottom of the table with four points but have three matches to be played.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/velsao-lodge-protest-against-churchill-for-fielding-ineligible-players/articleshow/81859837.cms||FLAVIO LOPES
---||India||Mantri: Punjab let Mukhtar Ansari use own ambulance to reach court||LUCKNOW/ CHANDIGARH: The mystery over the ambulance with a UP registration number that was used on Wednesday to ferry jailed gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari from Ropar jail to Mohali court in Punjab turned murkier on Thursday after UP minister and government spokesperson Siddharth Nath Singh said the ambulance is bullet-proof and owned by Mukhtar Ansari. He also questioned the role of the Punjab government in the entire issue. “A probe will be conducted to find out how an ambulance is being used as a private vehicle by Ansari,” he said. “It is now for the Punjab government to explain how a jail inmate was allowed to use a private vehicle to reach Mohali court for a hearing and brought back to Ropar jail. It is more than evident that the Congress government in Punjab is providing patronage to the gangster and Twitter rani Priyanka Gandhi should now explain this at least on Twitter,” said Singh. The Punjab prisons department has clarified that the ambulance used to transport Ansari on Wednesday is owned by him but it is not a bullet-proof ambulance and Punjab prisons rules allow use of private conveyance. “Jails department hands over a prisoner to the police party which takes the prisoner to the court as per the Punjab Prisoners (Attendance in Courts) Rules. There is a provision in these rules that the police party can allow a separate conveyance if a prisoner wants,” said Praveen Kumar Sinha, ADGP (prisons) Punjab. Sidharth Nath Singh said the registration papers of the ambulance show that the vehicle was purchased in 2013 on documents found to be containing incorrect information. “How did the government allow it. At that time, gangsters like Mukhtar were a part of the government,” he said. Vehicle records show it was purchased by Shyam Sanjeevni Hospital in Mau in 2013. A co-owner of the hospital Dr Alka Rai, who claims to be the general secretary of BJP Mahila wing (Gorakhpur region), confirmed she had signed papers meant for purchase in 2013. Punjab ADGP (prison), however, said there is also a precedent as various courts in UP had earlier allowed Ansari to use a separate private conveyance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mantri-punjab-let-mukhtar-ansari-use-own-ambulance-to-reach-court/articleshow/81864071.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty
---||Business||GST collections hit record high of Rs 1.24 lakh crore in March||NEW DELHI: GST collections rose 27% to hit a record high of nearly Rs 1.24 lakh crore in March, helping to narrow the deficit for the full financial year to around 7%. The mop-up -- based on sales in February 2021, for which returns were filed in March -- was boosted by imports with revenue from imported goods jumping 70%, while those from domestic transactions, including services imports, were 17% higher than the corresponding period in 2020. The impact of the coronavirus pandemic was first seen in February 2020 when the lockdown in Wuhan resulted in a disruption of shipments coming from China, where the deadly virus was first spotted. “GST revenues crossed above Rs 1 lakh crore mark at a stretch for the last six months and a steep increasing trend over this period are clear indicators of rapid economic recovery post pandemic. Closer monitoring against fake billing, deep data analytics using data from multiple sources including GST, income-tax and customs IT systems and effective tax administration have also contributed to the steady increase in tax revenue over last few months,” the finance ministry said in a statement. Although the base effect will come into play in the coming months, there has been a sustained recovery with collections rising 14% during the March quarter compared to 8% during October-December 2020. During the first half of 2020-21, GST collections had declined following the lockdown. “It (collection growth) clearly shows a sustained economic recovery and also is a result of GST audit closures and the government tightening compliance and anti-evasion measures,” said Pratik Jain, who leads the indirect tax practice at consulting firm PwC. What is providing even more comfort to experts is the growth in collections across all the states. “In addition to the trend of higher overall GST collections over the past six months, all major states have shown a significant increase compared to the previous year. Further the increase in collections on imports accompanied by the increase in domestic transactions would indicate that the overall production/consumption cycle is back to normal,” said MS Mani, senior director at Deloitte India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/gst-collections-hit-record-high-of-1-24l-crore-in-march/articleshow/81864039.cms||---

---||Business||Overnight, finance minister corrects ‘oversight’ on rate cuts||NEW DELHI: The government on Thursday hastily recalled an order drastically reducing interest rates on small savings schemes like post office deposits and public provident fund, with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman attributing it to 'oversight'. The rollback was seen to be a political decision as the rate cut coincided with the crucial second phase of elections in West Bengal, which is the top source of small savings deposits on a gross basis. Also, most phases of the ongoing assembly elections are still to roll out and the cuts were seen to hurt traditional savings choices, particularly among senior citizens. Sources, however, said the order was issued due to some communication gap. On Wednesday evening, the FM’s office was looking into a global report on gender gap and had sought data on women depositors and Sukanya Samridhi scheme. With the file cleared by the “competent authority”, a reference to officials, the message did not percolate clearly and the order slashing rates was issued around 8 PM. Sitharaman was briefed about it late night and she tweeted early Thursday, holding back the decision. As a result, interest rates, which were to fall by as much as 1.1 percentage point will remain unchanged up to June, Sitharaman said, less than 12 hours after her ministry had slashed them -- a move which would have seen returns on PPF fall to the lowest level in almost 47 years. The government has been facing criticism for not cutting taxes on petrol and diesel and deciding to tax interest earned by private sector employees on annual provident fund contributions of over Rs 2.5 lakh. Besides, falling interest rates, returns on fixed deposits barely cover inflation, which in any case has remained elevated due to food prices. Banks have been arguing for aligning small savings rates in line with their deposit rates. Given the wide user base, decisions to alter rates are taken after consultations at multiple levels in the government. This time, the need to reduce rates was seen to be greater as bank deposit rates had dropped in line with the Reserve Bank of India’s policy rates but small savings rates had been left unchanged since April 2020, although they are to be reset every quarter. The measures were also seen in sync with efforts to make finance less costly for the private sector borrowers. Times ViewEvery government has the right to frame policy the way it wants. It is assumed that the decision has been arrived at after due diligence with every angle being examined. Changing a policy within 12 hours indicates either a lack of application of mind in the original decision or extraneous considerations leading to a reversal. It doesn’t reflect well on the ministry.But the step seemed to have been pushed through without adequately weighing the overall impact on savers as well as the broader political economy. Small savings and provident fund are seen to be safe instruments that not only help the middle class build a retirement corpus but also take care of post-retirement needs through products such as senior citizens’ savings schemes. In April, at the start of the last financial year, the government had slashed interest rates by up to 1.4 percentage points.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/overnight-finance-minister-corrects-oversight-on-rate-cuts/articleshow/81864136.cms||---
---||India||Did road scheme trigger BSY-mantri rift?||BENGALURU: The management of a major road development scheme in rural Karnataka appears to be the trigger for the rift between B S Yediyurappa and K S Eshwarappa, who has protested the chief minister’s functioning style in a letter to the governor. Yediyurappa has been directly allocating special grants to MLAs under the ‘CM Grameena Sumarga’ scheme, which seeks to build or improve 20,000km of village roads over five years. This has reportedly left Eshwarappa, the rural development and panchayat raj (RDPR) minister, with no role to play in the project as MLAs are unilaterally taking up road works in their constituencies. Recent speculation that Yediyurappa planned to reassign the RDPR portfolio further angered Eshwarappa, who on Wednesday decided to formally question Yediyurappa’s alleged interference in his ministry. According to government officials, the RDPR department has been flush with funds meant for central programmes. The share of central funds in the department’s Rs 17,000-crore budget is Rs 10,000 crore. There have been problems in sanctioning lucrative road works, with allegations that certain MLAs regularly issue contracts for personal gain. According to a department official, the government sanctions Rs 1,200 crore for rural road works (Namma Grama, Namma Raste) and Rs 400 crore for road maintenance annually. “There would have been no issues if MLAs’ demands for road funds fell within this allocation. They sought funds over and above this allocation and this became a source of friction (in the cabinet),” the official said. Eshwarappa, according to BJP insiders, was furious that his department had been reduced to a rubber-stamp authority with no control over the Grameena Sumarga scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/did-road-scheme-trigger-bsy-mantri-rift/articleshow/81864160.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

The terrorists fired at the guard post outside Khan’s residence, causing serious injuries to one of the policemen on duty, Ramez Raja. “The guards fired in retaliation and deterred the attack. Raja was taken to the hospital where he was declared brought dead,” an official said, while adding that “Khan is safe”. Khan was BJP’s district president for Baramulla and party in-charge of Kupwara district. This is the second attack on BJP functionaries in the past four days.

A BJP councillor and a security guard were killed while another councillor was injured. Later, Kashmir IGP Vijay Kumar told reporters that Thursday’s attack was carried out by four LeT militants, of which two have been identified. They are from Srinagar city, he added. Kumar said one of the four militants was wearing a burqa. “There was one sentry on the main door and two cops in the guard room. As is clear from CCTV footage, the terrorist in the burqa knocked on the main door and asked the sentry to open the door imitating a woman’s voice.” When he opened the door, two other militants fired and the fourth one decamped with his rifle, he added. “The attack resulted in on the spot death of the jawan.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/terrorists-strike-jk-bjp-netas-house-cop-killed/articleshow/81864345.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The visit to Islamabad is certain to raise eyebrows here at a time the two countries, according to Pakistani authorities, have succeeded in developing some “strategic trust”. Russia’s growing ties with Pakistan, including in the military domain where the two countries have been conducting joint exercises, remains a thorny issue in its ties with India despite repeated assurances by Moscow that it will do nothing to jeopardise India’s security. Russian authorities said Lavrov would discuss economic cooperation and counter-terrorism issues with his counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi.

As she called governor Jagdeep Dhankhar from inside the booth at Boyal Maqtab Primary School and wrote a two-page letter to the Election Commission, Trinamool and BJP supporters fought it out in an adjacent paddy field. Droves of BJP supporters had streamed into the neighbourhood, “Jai Shri Ram” on their lips, around 1.40pm on hearing that the CM had arrived. Mamata sat in her wheelchair in the corridor leading to the polling booth as Trinamool supporters took on the BJP contingent, each side pelting stones at the other and some getting into fisticuffs as central forces, RAF and state police personnel struggled to disengage them. Groups of women then surged towards the single-storey school building, chanting pro-BJP slogans. Two EC observers reached the booth a little before 3pm and heard from Mamata how her polling agent was allegedly driven out thrice. "The EC has clamped Section 144 around the booth. How can BJP supporters in such massive numbers congregate within that radius to chant Jai Shri Ram?" she questioned. Read AlsoBJP’s victory claims laughable: TMCKOLKATA: The Trinamool lea- dership on Thursday called PM Narendra Modi’s jibe that CM Mamata Banerjee “had conceded defeat” in Nandigram “laughable and weird” and questioned why he was trying to influence voters in Nandigram. “We would urge the PM not to denigrate his chair and hope he refrainsThe CM spent 80 minutes cooped up inside before she was escorted out around 4pm. She handed a copy of her complaint to the officer-in-charge of Nandigram police station and asked him to treat it as an FIR. "There is a rampage outside the booth. People are armed. Anything may happen. Already 80% votes have been cast. Votes have been rigged," Mamata had been quoted as telling governor Dhankhar over the phone earlier. Nandigram reported 80.8% polling till 5pm, a shade lower than the 2016 turnout of 86.9%. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the constituency had recorded a voting percentage of 84.2. Special observer Nagendra Nath Tripathi, who had arrived to apprise the CM of "crowd-control measures", was on the firing line as Mamata ranted about "outsiders" being allowed a free run. "They are still shouting slogans. Is this an election?" she said. "I will not spare you if a single person is harmed. One of my supporters was killed in Keshpur on Wednesday." Read AlsoMamata was in booth for 1.5 hours but polling wasn’t disturbed: ECNEW DELHI: Responding to the alleged incident of crowding at a polling station in Nandigram, which allegedly kept West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee confined within the premises, the Election Commission cited a report from its observers and said polling went on smoothly in the constituency.Addressing reporters while leaving, the CM said, "We made 63 complaints to the EC. I am not worried about Nandigram. I am worried about democracy as polling here has been rigged." She threatened to move court if TMC's complaints were not addressed by the EC. BJP candidate Suvendu Adhikari arrived at the booth two hours later and accused his mentor-turned-rival of "holding up" the poll process after realising she would lose the electoral battle. "She was trying to get voting done by police. She has lost contact with the people. I am on a motorcycle, closer to the ground. I get better feedback. This vote is against appeasement," he said. Bengal's chief electoral officer Ariz Aftab said reinforcements had been sent to the Boyal booth. "We will seek a report from the district administration on violation of Section 144," he said. In Kolkata, governor Dhankhar said, "I am confident that all will act in the right spirit and earnestness so that democracy flourishes."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/drama-at-rural-booth-as-didi-cries-rigging-cadres-face-off/articleshow/81864364.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The sudden reversal was seen as a fallout of criticism that Pakistan had moved to restore trade relations without getting any traction on its demand for restoration of Article 370 in J&K. On Wednesday, in what was seen as a latest indication of a thaw in relations between the two countries, Pakistan’s finance minister Hammad Azhar had announced lifting of a nearly two-year ban on the import of sugar from India, saying Islamabad would allow import of 5,00,000 tonnes of white sugar to combat spiking domestic prices. Azhar had also said that ban on the import of raw cotton from India would also be lifted by the end of June. However, on Thursday, Pakistan’s minister for human rights Shireen Mazari said in a tweet after the cabinet meeting: “Today cabinet stated clearly NO trade with India.” She added that PM Imran Khan had made it clear that there can be no normalisation of relations with India until they reverse “their illegal actions” regarding Kashmir taken on August 5, 2019. Foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi told a local TV news channel that “there was an emerging perception that relations with India have moved towards normalisation and trade has been resumed”. “In the cabinet meeting, there was a unanimous opinion that as long as India does not review the unilateral steps it took on August 5, 2019, normalising relations with India will not be possible,” he said, adding that this was the prime minister’s opinion as well. The decision to turn down Wednesday’s announcement was taken hours after the human rights minister said that cabinet will review Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) decisions related to trade with India. Taking to Twitter, the minister had said it was only after the cabinet’s approval that the decision will be considered “approved by the government”. An official statement issued by the government on Wednesday had stated that ECC had allowed the commercial import of white sugar from India till June 30, 2021, through land and sea routes, on the basis of the quota issued by the ministry of commerce.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/in-24-hours-pakistan-does-u-turn-on-lifting-ban-on-indian-imports/articleshow/81864843.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

---||---||Didi has issues with Jai Shri Ram, is losing in Nandigram, says PM||JOYNAGAR/ ULUBERIA: Claiming he saw a “wave” in BJP’s favour in Bengal that was getting “stronger” after a “robust start” in the first phase of elections, PM Narendra Modi said on Thursday Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee had “conceded defeat” in Nandigram. “You all have seen what happened in Nandigram. It shows Didi has conceded defeat. All these indicate BJP is going to form government in Bengal. Filing nominations is due in the next phases of polls. There is a rumour that Didi is going to file nominations from somewhere else. Tell me, how far is this true?” Modi said at an Uluberia meeting in the afternoon while polling was on in 30 seats. “People came out in large numbers in Nandigram on Thursday. It appears from the voters’ mood that people in Nandigram were doing what entire Bengal wanted to do. I can see the wave of ashal paribartan firming up from this constituency,” Modi said. At Joynagar, South 24 Parganas, earlier in the day, Modi accused the Bengal CM of discounting Hindu motifs and chants like Jai Sri Ram. “Mamata Didi has issues with the Jai Sri Ram slogan. Entire Bengal knows it. Didi has issues with Durga idol immersion. Entire Bengal knows it. Didi has now problems with vermilion and saffron cloth. Didi’s men now call chotiwallas rakshashas. I know ghuspetiyas (infiltrators) are close to her. But she has no right to call the sons of Bharat Mata tourists. She can go on abusing me if she wants. But I won’t allow her to abuse the culture of Ramakrishna and Chaitanya,” Modi said at Joynagar, where polarisation among voters was palpable. The PM claimed the Bengal CM got “angry” when visited the Jashoreswari Kali and Orakandi Matua temples in Bangladesh. “Is it bad to visit a Kali temple? Is it wrong to pay tribute to Matua gurus Harichand Thakur and Guruchand Thakur?” said Modi, who also attacked Banerjee for “insulting” people from Bihar and UP after she said at Nandigram that “outsiders” from Bihar and UP had been brought to the constituency. “Didi is in enmity with the people of Bihar and UP. I would like to remind her that the Constitution doesn’t permit a CM to speak in that language. She is insulting people from other states,” he said. Modi then claimed the Bengal CM had been changing goalposts as May 2, when the results would be declared, neared. “She deserted her home turf in Bhowanipore to contest from Nandigram. She had been camping at Nandigram for the past three days to fetch votes when she could have avoided it had she served Bengal well. She wrote to all Opposition leaders to stand by her,” the PM said. He accused the ruling Trinamool of “bloodying Bengal” with murders and killings of BJP workers. Referring to octogenarian Shova Majumdar, who died after allegedly being beaten by Trinamool men, the PM said, “Trinamool is like a spear that has bloodied Bengal, pained its people. People will now take account of the killings from the Trinamool. Atyachar, bhrashtachar, rakter khela cholbe na, cholbe na (Torture, corruption and bloody games won’t be tolerated).” “People are angry with Didi. They have to shell out money while building houses, for admission to a government hospital or for their child’s admission or when youths make job applications. There is cut money everywhere. How will business flourish?” the PM said. The Prime Minister promised Rs 18,000 for every Bengal farmer deprived of benefits under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi. Modi also announced similar financial support for fishermen. “The BJP government will start the direct benefit transfer (DBT) process the day it assumes office in Bengal,” he promised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/didi-has-issues-with-jai-shri-ram-is-losing-in-nandigram-says-pm/articleshow/81864889.cms||Rupak Banerjee

It may kindly be noted that polling was not disrupted at any moment,” said observers Hemen Das and Ashutosh Roy in their report at 4.06PM. . While around 74% votes were polled at the polling station at the time of filing the report, nearly 3,000 people, who were there when the observers reached the spot, left soon after. Meanwhile, a separate hand-written complaint was received by EC from the chief minister via the state chief electoral officer on Thursday afternoon. “The same has been forwarded to special general observer Ajay Nayak and Special Police Observer Vivek Dube under intimation to CEO. They have been asked to send a report by tomorrow (Friday) 6 pm,” the EC stated. As part of the tight security arrangements for the second phase of polls, EC deployed 18 police observers and central forces to ensure “a peaceful, intimidation-free and conducive atmosphere for the smooth conduct of elections in a free, fair, inclusive and accessible” manner. Route marches in vulnerable pockets, regular point patrolling and other confidence-building measures were undertaken to reassure voters to come out and exercise their franchise freely. Outsiders were not allowed in the areas going to polls during the silence period, as per standing instructions of EC. The Commission also issued instructions that police officials including CAPF personnel will not go inside the polling booths unless required by the presiding officer due to law and order problem. Bike rallies were barred for 72 hours prior to polling. Live monitoring and webcasting of more than 50% of polling stations was done as per EC norms. Webcasting arrangements were put in place for 5,535 polling stations in West Bengal and 5,193 in Assam. Keeping pandemic concerns in view, all the polling stations followed Covid-19 safety protocols. Polling was conducted in full Covid-19 protective gear, under supervision of health authorities. During the second phase, a total of 10,620 ballot units (BUs), 10,620 control units (CUs) and 10,620 VVPATs were used in West Bengal and 10,819 BUs 10,592 CUs and 10,592 VVPATs in Assam. Non-functioning rate during the poll was less than experienced in the last few polls. A total number of 1,306 cases of model code violation cases were reported through the cVIGIL App from Assam, out of which 927 were disposed of as of 4.30 pm on Thursday. Similarly 14,499 cases were reported from West Bengal with 11,630 disposed of till 4.30 pm. “EC expresses gratitude to all stakeholders, especially the voters, for their enthusiastic and fearless participation."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mamata-was-in-booth-for-1-5-hours-but-polling-wasnt-disturbed-ec/articleshow/81865153.cms||---

"The entire state of Assam saw in a video yesterday how the identity of Assam and the symbol of the hard work of our Assamese sisters – the gamosa – was publicly insulted. Everyone who loves Assam is hurt and angry after seeing the footage. Congress and the mahajot will bear the punishment for this insult," Modi said while campaigning in Kokrajhar for the third phase of the assembly polls. The PM's salvo came even as Ajmal, against whom BJP has been running a strident campaign as the "patron of illegal immigrants", expressed regret for his "spur-of-the-moment act" during Wednesday's rally in minority-dominated Barpeta district. He had admittedly lost his cool over a felicitation dragging on for too long. Contacted by TOI, Ajmal said, "I never intended to insult Assamese culture. What does the PM know about Assamese culture? I know better than him how to respect the gamosa. I will continue to do that." For the Assamese community, the gamosa is more than just a utilitarian piece of fabric woven in white and embroidered in red. From adorning the sanctum sanctorum of a namghar (community prayer hall) to being proffered as a token of love and respect to a guest, its significance and versatility – villagers also use it as a tongali (waistband) or a suriya (loincloth) – have made it a unifying symbol of the state's indigenous demography. During the street protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in December 2019, protesters had used it as a symbol of dissent by creating a carpet of gamosas to stop lathi-charging cops. PM Modi is among the many national figures, including those in the arts, who often use the gamosa as a scarf. Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said Ajmal had proved by his act of throwing a gamosa at someone in a fit of anger that he didn't have the right to use one. "I want to know who put a gamosa around Ajmal’s neck. He doesn't know the value of the gamosa and so isn't qualified to wear one," he said at a rally in Palasbari near Guwahati. Last month, perfume baron Ajmal had found himself at the receiving end of public criticism when his supporters in Morigaon addressed Assam’s Vaishnavite saint Srimanta Sankardev as "sahab" and shouted "Sankardev zindabad". Ajmal apologised later, calling it "a slip of the tongue".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ajmal-flings-gamosa-pm-calls-it-insult-to-assam/articleshow/81865164.cms||Prabin Kalita

---||---||Pakistan flag hoisted by miscreants||GUWAHATI: The 39 seats in 13 districts of Assam that went to the polls in the second phase of the assembly elections on Thursday witnessed a lower turnout than in 2016. According to the media nodal officer of the state election commission Rahul Chandra Das, the cumulative voter turnout at 8pm was over 77%. He, however, said that the number is likely to increase after the final compilation of all reports submitted by the returning officers. In 2016, the average voter turnout in these 39 constituencies was over 82%. Barring clashes between BJP and AIUDF supporters at Sonai, which forced police to fire in the air to bring the situation under control, polling was mostly peaceful. Rain slowed down polling in some seats earlier in the day. In Rangia, miscreants erected a Pakistani flag in the Gurkusi area. It was later burnt down by locals while chanting ‘Bharat maata ki jai’. The 47 seats which went to polls on March 27 in the first phase had registered a polling precentage of over 79%, which was also below the 2016 turnout of over 85%. Unlike the first-phase constituencies that are pre-dominantly inhabited by indigenous people and the third phase constituencies where the Bengali-speaking migrant Muslims are in overwhelming numbers, the demography in the 39 constituencies in the second phase comprising the Barak Valley, two hill districts, central Assam and parts of Bodoland Territorial Region and the north bank of Brahmaputra is more or less balanced on religious lines. The stakes are high for all the three major players — BJP, Congress and AIUDF — in the second phase. In the first phase, the contest in the 47 constituencies was primarily between NDA and Congress, with regional parties Raijor Dal and AJP being the third player in a few seats. BJP star campaigner Himanta Biswa Sarma said, “The BJP wave is clearly visible. We will win 25 to 27 seats in the second phase, which means the final verdict has been sealed today in favour of the NDA. The third-phase election is now a mere formality.” Sarma had earlier predicted that the NDA will win 39 to 40 seats in first phase and together with his prediction of seats for the second phase, the NDA’s tally should be 64 to 67, which is past the halfway mark in the house of 126. However, AIUDF chief Badrudin Ajmal believes that the second and third phase belongs to the Congress-led “mahajot”. “In the second phase, the mahajot will win all the seats and the NDA will be wiped out. The third phase is also ours.’ In 2016, NDA (BJP, AGP, BPF) had won 28 of these 39 seats out of which BJP’s tally was 22, eight of which were from the Barak Valley. AGP had won 2 and BPF 4. From the remaining 11 seats, six were won by Congress and five by AIUDF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/assam/pakistan-flag-hoisted-by-miscreants/articleshow/81865166.cms||Prabin Kalita

This happened after midnight on Wednesday at Tikunia town in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri district. Harendra Kumar, 22, is now battling for life at the district hospital. “He has been preparing for competitive exams and wakes up at 3am every day. On Wednesday, he had woken up before dawn and gone to an orchard. Brahmdeen (the girl’s father) and his three sons — Raju (21), Bharat (20) and Gajraj (18) — caught him, abused him for being from a lower caste and beat him up with an iron rod, baton and belts. Then, they inserted an iron rod into his rectum and repeatedly hit him in the private parts with the rod,” his cousin Anuj told TOI on Thursday. “They thought he was going to meet the girl. They treated him like he was not human.” Brahmdeen, Raju, Bharat and Gajraj were booked.

---||---||Charge of saffron brigade: PM Modi, Amit Shah lead from front||KOLKATA: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been to West Bengal five times since the assembly polls were announced on February 26. Modi began his election campaign at the Kolkata Brigade Parade Grounds on March 7, followed by Kharagpur on March 20, Bankura on March 21, Contai in East Midnapore on March 24, and two more meetings at Joynagar and Uluberia on April 1. Bengal BJP leaders say the PM will visit Bengal again on April 3. Bengal was at the back of his mind when Modi paid a visit to Jashoreswari Kali temple and Matua temple at Orakandi, Bangladesh, on March 27. The PM, while on a two-day visit to Bangladesh, didn’t forget to tweet to Bengal voters headed to the first phase of polls to come out in large numbers. During his address at Orakandi, Modi quoted from Matua poet Mahananda Halder’s book “Sri Sri Guruchand Charit” and said the Matua gurus had “ divyadrishti and alaukik shakti (divine power to see the future)”. His Bengali accent, too, has improved over the months from the January 23 birth centenary celebrations of Subhas Chandra Bose when he copiously quoted Tagore. Modi can now, without the wrong pause, say in Bengali: “ Apnara bhoy paben na, apnara nischinte vote din (Do not fear, vote without worry).” Compare this with the PM’s visits to poll-bound Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry — they are much fewer than his trips to Bengal. According to BJP leaders, Modi is likely to frequent Bengal more from the third phase. “On April 3, the PM will be holding public meetings at Sonarpur in South 24 Parganas and Arambagh in Hooghly,” a party leader said. Both these seats are known to be Trinamool bastions. Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP president J P Nadda, on the other hand, have been leading roadshows on a weekly basis. Shah held three roadshows at Nandigram, East Midnapore, followed by Panskura West and Debra in West Midnapore, but had to miss the roadshow in Diamond Harbour. Nadda held roadshows in Hooghly. The frequent visits by Modi, Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, among others, point to BJP’s high stakes in Bengal. Party leaders are desperate to wrest the state from chief minister Mamata Banerjee in the 2021 assembly polls and are eyeing the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, in which BJP wants a larger share of parliamentary seats from the east to make up for projected losses in north and west India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/charge-of-saffron-brigade-pm-modi-amit-shah-lead-from-front/articleshow/81865285.cms||Rohit Khanna

Advocate Hemang Shah tendered an affidavit in the HC on Wednesday in response to the state government’s submissions that no land parcel has been allotted till date for railway track upgradation and for laying down of pipelines for oil and gas and fibre optic, and there are proposals only to this effect at different levels. The amicus curiae questioned the forest department’s claims that land has not been allotted for railway line upgradation and electrification. He cited a TOI report published on December 4 saying that there was no environment impact assessment before sending a proposal for allotment of 148 hectare land for this project. He also submitted that laying down of pipelines for oil and gas would lead to environmental damage in future. After refuting government claims that steps are undertaken to protect Asiatic lions and the forest, the amicus curiae urged the HC to stay the operation and implementation of these proposals. “If the abode of Asiatic lions is not protected, then there will be no more lions. The entire region is being eroded in a systematic manner. The area surrounding Gir is given to corporate houses and which will lead to destruction of the forest area,” amicus curie’s reply reads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/land-around-gir-being-given-to-business-houses-amicus-curiae-tells-gujarat-high-court/articleshow/81865293.cms||---
---||India||Congress backs Mamata letter seeking united stand vs BJP||NEW DELHI: Congress Thursday backed Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee’s letter seeking opposition unity, despite being rivals in the West Bengal election, saying the leader’s call reflects the view of Congress on the issue of “protecting the Constitution from the attacks of the BJP”. When asked about the party stand, AICC spokesman Rajeev Shukla said, “The sentiment of opposition unity has always been there in Congress. Rahul Gandhi has repeatedly said that constitutional institutions are under attack from the BJP government and the opposition should fight unitedly against this assault. Congress always talks about a united opposition, especially on national issues or on the subject of protecting the Constitution.” Shukla was quick to remind that the Congress leadership even held a one-day dharna at the Rajghat to protest against the Modi regime’s attacks on the Constitution. While he added that Banerjee’s letter was addressed to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, the response marked a strong approval of the missive from the West Bengal chief minister. The paradox is that Congress is also contesting in the state polls partnering Left front, the traditional TMC rival, and the state leadership has been attacking Banerjee. However, Rahul Gandhi has not toured the state even once since election dates were announced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-backs-mamata-letter-seeking-united-stand-vs-bjp/articleshow/81865321.cms||---

The opposition in UP condemned the demand on Thursday, saying the government should function according to the Constitution and not as per the whims of priests and saints, or else it will set a dangerous precedent. On Wednesday, Giri had said: “India got Independence 74 years ago and roads named after Mughal invaders like Tughlak, Humayun and Babur, and Britishers in Delhi should be renamed after Chandra Shekhar Azad, Subhas Chandra Bose, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Gulzari Lal Nanda and Veer Abdul Hameed.” Giri further said: “Why should roads still be named after Mughal invaders and Britishers, who looted and divided the country? Most countrymen, particularly youngsters, feel embarrassed after seeing roads named after invaders. These roads should be renamed on martyrs who laid down their lives for the country.” Reacting sharply to the Akhara Parishad chief’s statement, SP district spokesperson Daan Bahadur ‘Madhur’ said, “The contribution of Mughal emperors in making India a great nation cannot be forgotten.” He accused the saffron brigade of diverting the attention of the common man from persisting problems like unemployment and inflation to irrelevant issues. Pradesh Congress Committee member Mukund Tiwari said, “Roads are named after personalities who made our nation great irrespective of their caste, creed and religion.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rechristen-all-roads-named-after-mughals-says-akhara-parishad/articleshow/81865334.cms||Kapil Dixit

Anticipating good gathering on Friday to witness ‘Way of the Cross’, the enactment of Christ’s suffering till his crucifixion and accompanying prayers, the churches have made necessary arrangements to follow Covid-19 safety protocols like social distancing, use of sanitiser and face masks. Patna Archbishop Sebastian Kallupura will lead the Way of the Cross, which will start from the premises of St Joseph’s Convent High School and culminate at St Joseph’s Pro-Cathedral Church. The prayer services will start at 4pm. The Archbishop has asked the Catholic churches to ensure that the Veneration of the Cross is done by touching instead of kissing the cross. Churches in the city on Thursday observed a special communion service on ‘Maundy Thursday’ in memory of Lord Jesus’ last supper. During the prayer service, parish priests observe a foot-washing ceremony that replicates Jesus’ own washing of his 12 disciples’ feet. Fr Prem Prakash SJ, Vicar General of Patna Archdiocese, said the verses that contain the account of the events that followed the last supper of Jesus Christ with his 12 disciples a day before his crucifixion was read from the Gospel of John during the mass prayer. “From midnight, all the status of Jesus will be covered by cloth and it will open only after God Friday,” he said. At Joseph’s Pro-Cathedral Church, Archbishop and Vicar General washed the feet of 12 disciples (faithful devotees), including six women. Around 300 devotees gathered for the prayer service on Thursday. Fr Prakash said all Covid protocols were followed during the communion and the number of devotees was restricted to 300 at Joseph’s Pro-Cathedral Church. Around 1,000 devotees gathered for prayer service at Queen of the Apostles’ Church, Kurji, which was led by the parish priest Fr Michael Prashant Pius SJ. Like previous year, the church has decided not to take out the ‘jhanki’ (passion play), while Way of the Cross will be held around 2pm on church premises on Friday. Parish priest Fr Lalit Barla OFM Capuchin washed the feet of 12 disciples while leading mass prayer at Padri Ki Haveli in Patna City.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/churches-in-patna-to-skip-some-good-friday-rituals-amid-pandemic/articleshow/81857987.cms||Faryal Rumi

Altogether 79,454 people in the 45-59 category, including health minister Mangal Pandey, took their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, while a total of 2,10,915 doses were administered across all categories on Thursday. The vaccinations were done at nearly 2,200 session sites. To further facilitate the drive, keeping in mind the vast group of beneficiaries, the state health department will increase the number of session sites to 5,000. Now everyone above 45 years of age, even without any comorbidity, can take the vaccine. After taking the shot at IGIMS, Pandey urged others to come forward and get themselves vaccinated. “I request everyone who falls under the 45+ category to come to the session sites and take the vaccine. There is no need to be frightened, as crores of people in the country and nearly 29 lakh people in Bihar have taken the shot,” Pandey said. He was accompanied by his wife Urmila for the vaccination. Pandey said though the cases have increased in Bihar in the past few days, the situation was under control compared to other states where over 1,000 new cases are getting registered in a day. He further said the department was adhering to the SOP of the test, track and treat, but cautioned people to follow all safety protocols, including mask, maintaining social distance, washing hands and avoiding unnecessary travel. Health department special secretary Manoj Kumar said they got a good response on the first day of the third phase of the vaccination. “We did not get any complaint from any session site today. People did not have to wait much,” said Manoj, adding that since the comorbidity rider has been dropped, people need not show only an identity card, which could establish their age as well as their identity. He further said the number of session sites is being slowly increased and on Thursday nearly 300 additional session sites were added and the final target is to set up 5,000 session sites in the state. Data shared by the state health department stated that 2,01,631 lakh beneficiaries got their first dose of vaccine. This includes 1,15,289 lakh, senior citizens. Another 9,284 beneficiaries got their second dose. So far, over 30 lakh doses of vaccines have been administered in Bihar, including both the first and the second dose||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/over-79k-get-covid-vaccine-shots-in-45-category-in-bihar/articleshow/81860105.cms||Sheezan Nezami

In order to inoculate the maximum number of recipients, the state health department has decided to keep all vaccination centres across the state open on all days in April. On Thursday, 2,673 sessions were held and so far, around 1,29,128 people have been vaccinated in the state. The total vaccination count stands at 52.7 lakh. “The vaccine will be offered on all days in April, including gazetted holidays, at vaccination centres across private and government hospitals,” said a health department source. Jadavpur resident Surjya Sen, a private firm employee, had set out from his residence at 8am and when he reached the Kolkata Municipal Corporation-run centre at Layelka at 8.15am and registered, he was behind 91 people. In fact, several people had turned up as early as 5.30am. By 10am, when the vaccination process had started, the queue had become quite long. “When I reached the clinic I was surprised to find over 90 people had already been registered. I was lucky to have got the jab today itself,” said Sen, who turned 45 last year. A TOI visit to KMC’s Layelka clinic revealed while the civic body had a provision for attending to 150 applicants on April 1, by 12.45pm 147 had been registered and there was still a queue. “Based on the availability of vaccines, we can attend to 150 applicants today. If more turn up, we will ask them to visit some other day,” said a civic official. According to the official, of the 150 applicants, around 50 belonged to the 45-59 age group and the rest were senior citizens. According to a KMC health department official, the civic brass had adopted measures for enhancement of the capacity at ward vaccination centres predicting a surge in applicants from Thursday. But they could not satisfy all due to a rush. “We opened 80 clinics across the city and enhanced our vaccination capacity to a target of 10,000 per day. But we need to enhance our capacity further,” the official said. Some of the KMC clinics that saw a rush include Mayor’s Clinic at Chetla, and KMC clinics in Behala, Garia, Patuli, Tollygunge, Jorasanko, College Street, Bidhan Sarani, Sinthee, Central Avenue, Burrabazar and Taltala. Besides KMC clinics, the state health department on Thursday opened its Kolkata Metropolitan Urban Health Organization (KMUHO) units to cater to the vaccination demand. On Thursday, at the KMUHO Sulekha unit, only 100 out of those who turned up could be vaccinated. Of them, 40% were in the 45-59 age group. “We need to enhance our capacity as we are predicting a surge in applicants,” said Tanima Mandal, in charge of KMUHO units. At Medica Superspecialty Hospital, 600 people in the 45-59 age group took the jab on Thursday while at 145 were vaccinated at Peerless Hospital. The three units of AMRI vaccinated 363 recipients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/registration-rush-across-city-as-45-group-gets-first-shot/articleshow/81858611.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Covid cases jump 23% in a week; third wave high in severity too?||AHMEDABAD: As the state climbed yet another high at 2,410 new Covid-19 cases in 24 hours, the hospital beds are fast filling up – Ahmedabad-based private hospitals recorded 64% occupancy, whereas two major hospitals – Civil Hospital and Sola Civil Hospital – reached 50% of their capacity with surge in the cases. One of the reasons for the surge in hospitalization is believed to be a changing virus. While the third surge was believed to be all about spread and less severity, some of the patients are getting admitted with high viral load, city-based experts point out. Out of 2,090 patients in 90 private hospitals of Ahmedabad, 23% were on either ventilator or in ICU. In government-run hospitals, the ratio was nearly the same. The silver lining is the mortality has not increased significantly. Compared to 10 positive patients who succumbed to the virus out of every 1,000 patients in the post-Diwali period, the current mortality is 3 deaths per 1,000 cases. Dr Mueskh Maheshwari, a city-based pathologist and member of Indian Medical Association (IMA) Gujarat executive committee, said that even in the cases with moderate symptoms, the CT severity score is in the range of 17 to 24, which is relatively higher. “It could be one of the reasons that the spread is faster. We have witnessed many families where over three to four members are under treatment,” he said, adding that CRP score however has remained lower, reducing mortality in such cases. Dr Pradip Patel, CMO at Sola Civil Hospital, said that compared to the past week, more patients require hospitalization. “Several patients – including those below 50 years – come with high viral load. Treatment protocol however has not changed compared to the past two surges,” he said. “Earlier, the ratio of hospitalization to home isolation was about 1:5, but now it would be 1:1 or 1:2. The change could be attributed to moderate to severe symptoms manifested,” said Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), adding that the hospitalization due to Covid-19 has increased steadily. “If the severity is high, we advise the patients to get admitted,” said Dr Kartikeya Parmar, in-charge of 1200-bed Covid-19 hospital at Civil Hospital campus. “We advise the persons with even milder symptoms to get tested so that Covid-19 is detected early. With change in signs and milder symptoms, several of the patients knew that they were positive only when their symptoms turned severe,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-cases-jump-23-in-a-wk-third-wave-high-in-severity-too/articleshow/81859261.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Business||Jeh Wadia quits as Bombay Dyeing MD||MUMBAI: Eight days after he exited GoAir as its MD, Jehangir (Jeh) Wadia stepped down as the MD of Bombay Dyeing and Manufacturing Company — the flagship of the Nusli Wadia Group. In a regulatory filing, Bombay Dyeing said Jeh will not be renewing his contract as MD of the company that expired on March 31. The 47-year-old Jeh, the second son of group chairman Nusli Wadia, took over as the MD of Bombay Dyeing on April 1, 2011. Jeh has relinquished his role as MD at Bombay Dyeing and GoAir while continuing to be its promoter, sources said. It wasn’t immediately clear if he will be inducted in a non-executive director’s capacity at Bombay Dyeing and GoAir. Older brother Ness as well as the senior Wadia are on the board of the two companies. The two exit moves indicate that the Wadia family wants to separate ownership from management. Sources said the restructuring is aimed at “professionalising the management” in Wadia Group operating entities, with the family continuing to hold shareholder rights and directorships. The group wants to bring in professional management to run their companies, said Shriram Subramanian, founder and MD of proxy advisory firm InGovern Research. The Wadia Group, said the sources, wanted to follow the ownership and management separation model as that of Britannia, which has been a success story. Britannia, one of the largest bakery and dairy products players, has a market cap of Rs 87,156 crore as compared to the Rs 10,818-crore aggregate market cap of other listed Wadia companies — Bombay Burmah Trading, Bombay Dyeing and National Peroxide. The practice of separating ownership and management has been implemented in Infosys where its founders left the running of the IT services company to qualified professional managers, while retaining the voting rights.  The day-to-day management at Bombay Dyeing will now be looked after by Suresh Khurana, who oversees the polyester business, and Hitesh Vora, the CFO, under the supervision of non-independent director Minnie Bodhanwala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/jeh-wadia-quits-as-bombay-dyeing-md/articleshow/81863321.cms||Reeba Zachariah

Station officer (Hathigawan) D N Yadav said, “A joint team of the surveillance cell and Hathigawan police received an input that two men, including Guddu Singh alias Sanjay Pratap Singh and Rajesh Saroj of Balipur, were operating an organised liquor racket in different UP districts. They used to fix fake hologram and wrappers on liquor bottles and were also involved in manufacturing of spurious liquor with the help of chemicals.” The accused used to smuggle IMFL and desi liquor from neighbouring states and later mix adulterated booze in the bottles before selling them with changed QR codes in different parts of the state. On being tipped off about a huge consignment kept at Saroj’s house, the team raided the premises and seized 298 cartons of liquor. A case under sections 420, 467, 468, 471, 272, 273 of IPC and sections 60 and 63 of excise act has been registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/illicit-booze-worth-rs-22-lakh-seized-in-pratapgarh/articleshow/81854216.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Rename all roads named after Mughals, British: ABAP chief||Prayagraj: Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) chief Narendra Giri’s demand for rechristening all roads named after Mughal invaders and Britishers has triggered a fresh controversy. Opposition parties on Thursday condemned the demand saying the government should function according to the Constitution of the country and not as per whimsical demands of priests and saints or else it will set a dangerous precedent. On Wednesday, Giri had said, “India got Independence 74 years ago and roads named after Mughal invaders like Tughlak, Humayun and Babur and Britishers in Delhi should be renamed after Chandra Shekhar Azad, Subhas Chandra Bose, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Gulzari Lal Nanda and Veer Abdul Hameed.” “Why should roads still be named after Mughal invaders and Britishers who looted and divided the country? Most countrymen, particularly youngsters, feel embarrassed after seeing roads named on invaders. These roads should be renamed on martyrs who laid their lives for the country,” said Giri. “Visit any city of the country and you will find roads named on Mughal invaders or Britishers who looted, divided the country,” said Giri. We demand that the Union government should rename all these roads on our freedom fighters and martyrs, he added. Reacting sharply on the statement, Samajwadi Party district spokesperson Daan Bahadur ‘Madhur’ said, “Such demands will set a dangerous precedent. The contribution of Mughal emperors in making India a great nation cannot be forgotten.” He accused the saffron brigade of diverting the attention of common man from persisting problems like unemployment and inflation to irrelevant issues. Pradesh Congress Committee member Mukund Tiwari said, “It’s an unfortunate statement. Roads are named on personalities who made our nation great irrespective of their caste, creed and religion.” There were many good administrators who worked for the unity and integrity of the country, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/rename-all-roads-named-after-mughals-british-abap-chief/articleshow/81854137.cms||---

Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash said on Thursday, “We have arrested Osmanabad resident Rajkumar Dagdu Khedkar (28), Manoj Rajendra Bade (33) of Moshi and Ganesh Gholap (30) of Bhosari and seized five two-wheelers, worth Rs3.40lakh, which the trio bought on loan by using documents of other people.” A case of cheating, forgery and misappropriation has been registered against the trio with the Bhosari police after one of the victims, Ramchandra Machindra Hanpude (35) from Chakan, lodged a complaint, he said. According to Hanpude’s complaint, the trio purchased a scooter by fraudulently using his documents and obtained a loan of Rs73,600 in his name.

Moreover, level-2 facilities have also been restarted. District magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma told TOI on Thursday, “Section 144 CrPC has been enforced in the district. So far, the entire focus was on vaccination drive in order to curb the Covid mortality rate. But, as the fresh wave has adopted an alarming trend again since last week of March, it has been decided to give equal emphasis to increasing sampling for lab tests and restarting level-2 facilities.” “Sample testing is being done at the airport and also randomly at railway stations and bus stands,” he said adding, “now efforts will be made to allow the entry of people in the city through these points after testing of their samples only.” “Strict enforcement of Covid-19 protocol including mandatorily wearing of mask, maintaining of social distancing and sanitisation will also be restarted at all places of public gathering like at ghats along river Ganga and markets by roping in police,” he added. Regarding treatment facilities, the DM said BHU had been asked to increase the number of beds in the L-3 facility at its super-speciality wing. L-2 facility has been restarted at DDU district hospital while ESIC and other hospitals have also been asked to be in alert mode. The number of sites for vaccinations are being increased with the beginning of vaccination of people over 45 years of age. He added that in the panchayat poll process, wearing a mask for candidates for receiving nomination forms, its submission and canvassing has been made a must. All polling staff above 45-years in age would be vaccinated on priority, he added. On the other hand, the Varanasi Municipal Corporation also re-launched the mega sanitation drive. The city health officer Dr NP Singh said that a roaster has been finalised as per the directives of the DM and municipal commissioner to ensure that the entire city area is covered under the drive. Repeated sanitation works will be evident at the places of public gathering, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/as-covid-cases-rise-sec-144-imposed-in-dist/articleshow/81863098.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Business||Yes Bank buys Rel Infra HQ||Mumbai: Reliance Infrastructure has said that it has sold Reliance Centre — the premises housing the group’s headquarters — to Yes Bank for Rs 1,200 crore. “Entire proceeds from the sale of Reliance Centre, Santa Cruz (Mumbai), is utilised only to repay the debt of Yes Bank,” the company said in a statement to the exchange. In July, the private lender had taken symbolic possession of the sprawling complex situated off the Western Express Highway and overlooking the Mumbai airport. The action was taken under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (Sarfaesi) Act to recover dues of Rs 2,892 crore from Anil Ambani’s Reliance Infrastructure. In terms of the act, the bank has to give a two-month notice before taking possession, which it had done in May. Speaking to TOI in October 2020 after the bank’s half-yearly results, Yes Bank MD & CEO Prashant Kumar had said the bank would like to monetise it but would consider moving its offices from its present headquarters at Lower Parel in Central Mumbai to Santa Cruz. While there is uncertainty over the future of commercial real estate given the shift to work-from-home, private equity investors are still bullish on office space. Yes Bank currently operates out of the Indiabulls Finance Centre in Lower Parel where it has leased the top six floors. According to news reports in 2011, the deal was struck at Rs 125 per sqft per month for 1.6 lakh sqft. However, since the reconstruction of the bank after its revival by investors led by SBI, the lender has been cutting costs. It has asked all offices to renegotiate rentals and has been rationalising branches and ATMs. Reliance Group had shifted to the new headquarters in 2018. After its debt crisis, the group has shrunk its operations. Besides Reliance Infra, other group companies including Reliance Capital and its subsidiaries were headquartered there. Most of the offices were consolidated in the north wing and part of the property was listed for lease. The lockdown due to the pandemic resulted in further consolidation of office space as staff were asked to work from home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/yes-bank-buys-rel-infra-hq/articleshow/81863087.cms||---

Crisil Ratings MD Gurpreet Chatwal said the ratio of rating upgrades to rating downgrades improved from 0.54 in the first half to 1.33 in the second half. This means that while there were 54 upgrades for every 100 downgrades in the first half of the year, the second half saw 133 upgrades for every 100 downgrades. The rebound in the economy would push bank credit growth to 9-10% in FY22, which is around 400 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) higher than the credit growth in FY21. Highly resilient sectors such as pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals had performed well and maintained credit ratio above 1 even during the worst phase of the pandemic, backed by sustained demand. Low-resilience sectors such as hospitality and real estate developers continue to see more downgrades than upgrades, even as pace of downgrades slowed in the second half. According to Crisil Ratings senior director Somasekhar Vemuri, the sharp rise in Covid cases since mid-February 2021 and the impact of any stringent containment measures on businesses are the key threats to the nascent demand recovery and could impact the credit quality outlook adversely. “That said, Crisil Ratings’s resilience study of 42 sectors indicates that only 6, accounting for 4% of rated debt, are highly sensitive to a Covid-19 resurgence, while 20 are moderately sensitive,” he added. Senior director (financial sector) Krishan Sitaraman said that loans to corporate sector, which had turned negative in the previous financial year, would turn positive in FY22. However, the growth would be slower than other segments. He said the rating agency had factored in a half percentage point increase in interest rates with 10-year benchmark moving up to 6.5%. However, that would not have any impact on the asset quality of banks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/gdp-to-grow-11-in-fy22-crisil/articleshow/81861267.cms||Mayur Shetty

In the light of a few cases of people getting infected even after vaccination, doctors have advised residents to follow safety protocols, including wearing face-masks, frequent hand-sanitisation and social-distancing even after taking the jab. “Apart from adherence to Covid preventive norms, the vaccinated people should continue to take healthy diet and do breathing exercises to boost their immune system. A person gets fully immunized after three weeks of the second Covid vaccine shot. However, they can still get infected but the severity of the ailment will be nominal, like common influenza,” city-based physician Dr Diwakar Tejashwi said. He added that the authorities should keep track of people getting infected and severely ill even after getting both doses of the vaccine. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P) nodal officer for Covid echoed similar views. “People can be a carrier of the virus even after getting vaccinated. Thus, they should follow preventive measures, including regularly sanitise hands and social- distancing as well as doing breathing exercises,” he said. Most beneficiaries of the Covid vaccine claimed it to be a simple exercise. Retired government employee Om Prakash (68), who took the jab recently, said, “I did not experience any side effects after getting vaccinated. Now, I feel safe and energetic. I would suggest everyone take the vaccine as soon as possible.” Covid-19 vaccinations started across the country on January 16 with healthcare workers given the jab in the first phase. The second phase of vaccination covering frontline workers, including police, administrative and civic body staff commenced on February 6. Later, people above 60 years, or those above 45 years but with co-morbidities started getting vaccinated from March 1 and now all people above 45 years are getting the vaccines from Thursday. The beneficiaries have been advised to check pre-existing medical conditions and co-morbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes and heart diseases to avoid side- effects. Fort people with no major medical history, the side effects aren't alarming nor life-threatening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/dont-give-up-masks-sanitising-after-vaccination-experts/articleshow/81858136.cms||---

Touts operating from IGIMS also take attendants of patients to nearby medical shops for buying medicines and get commission for it. “Virendra was a tout. Several other touts used to work under him. Another group of touts was trying to capture the specific time slot as it generates more income. This rivalry led to Virendra’s killing,” the SP said. Tiwari said eight people have been made named accused in the FIR lodged in connection with Virendra’s murder. “Two suspects have been detained and are being interrogated,” he added. Kumar (40) was shot dead in Bramhasthani lane under the Shastri Nagar police station area on Wednesday night. The killing took place at an eatery located just beside IGIMS mortuary gate. At least four to five criminals fired at Virendra, killing him on the spot. A minor, Sheikh Arbaz (9), had also received bullet injury. Meanwhile, irate locals blocked Bailey Road in front of IGIMS here on Thursday morning for more than an hour to protest Virendra’s murder. The protesters, including Virendra’s family members, disrupted traffic on the busy road. They kept Virendra’s body on the road while protesting.

He was speaking at the launch of a new software application, which will connect the offices of sub-registrars and circle officers (CO). , "The process of mutation would begin simultaneously with land registration. The sellers and buyers will have to submit the requisite forms at the time of registration," the minister said. The new system came into effect across the state on Thursday.

It would be done digitally through the app," he added. He, however, clarified that the facility would be available only to those purchasing land from the sellers having 'jamabandi' (ownership) in their names. "Others will have to follow the traditional method of mutation," he added. The minister said the benefits of government schemes would be given to only those who have 'jamabandi' in their names. "Our emphasis is to rid people of the cumbersome process of mutation of land," he added.

Addressing senior officials at a meeting here to review Gaya sewerage project, Nitish said excessive use of groundwater can be prevented through Ganga waterlift scheme in towns like Rajgir, Bodh Gaya, Gaya and Nawada. He also asked the officials to prepare a work plan for better sewerage system in big towns like Gaya. “Prepare a plan and expedite work on sewage treatment plant (STP).

There is a target to provide 135 litres of water per head everyday. In view of the population growth and footfall of tourists, work is on to ensure drinking water facility to every household. This will help to check over exploitation of groundwater which is crucial for environment protection,” the CM said. Earlier in the meeting, urban development and housing department principal secretary Anand Kishore made a presentation of the STP at the official residence of the CM here.

Tata Consumer inherited the business through the acquisition of Tetley Tea in 2000. The food services business includes a tea factory in Georgia and a distribution unit engaged in the sale of tea and coffee products to supermarkets, ‘dollar’ and military stores in the US. Tata Consumer will be selling its share in the business to long-time partner Harris Tea. The Indian company is exiting the US food services business as this no longer fits its current strategy of focusing on branded portfolios in the international market. The tea factory is housed under Southern Tea and the distribution business is under Empirical. “Other than the strategic advantage to Tata Consumer from exiting the food services business, there are no other benefits to the company’s promoter from the said transaction,” it said in a regulatory filing. Once the transaction is completed, Southern Tea will continue to manufacture for Tetley and Good Earth brands, Tata Consumer said.

And soon, you are likely to find these value-added fish products on store shelves in Kashmir. Recently, a team of students and faculty members of Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology (SKUAST-K) visited Veraval after learning about the success story scripted by nearly 300 women of Sagar Manthan Machhimar Utthan Mandal, a cooperative society. These women of the Kharva community have been making and selling over a dozen products including fish pizzas, cheese balls, samosas, burgers, sandwiches, cutlets, pickles, chutneys, and other ready-to-cook fish meals. The cooperative society and the varsity have decided to join hands and sell ‘Made in Veraval’ fish products in Kashmir, under the cooperative’s brand name, on franchise model. What’s more, the Veraval women will also share their formula so that the same delicacies can be made from freshwater fishes in Kashmir. Faisal Rashid, assistant professor-cum-scientist, post-harvest technology said, “We are highly impressed by the work done by these women. We want to set up their franchise in Kashmir. We will start with Srinagar and expand to other districts like Anantnag and Baramulla.” Rashid, who was part of the 35-member group, said, “Learning how to make such value-added fish products will help generate employment for locals in Kashmir.” Ashfauq Aga, assistant professor, aquaculture engineering, added, “People engaged in the fish industry in Kashmir do not have the knowledge to make value-added products. We want to help students passing out of the university to open stores of fish products in various parts of the state like Sopore and Pulwama. There are a large number of hotels and tourist spots where our students can sell these products.” Amrin Shabir, a student of the varsity said “By setting up such franchises, we can generate opportunities for Kashmiri women to earn more profit from fish.”  Shailesh Suyani, president of the cooperative society, added, “We can send soup powder, cheese balls, ready-to-cook products like samosas, noodles, and papads directly to Kashmir for sale. We can also share the formula for other products. This, in turn, will generate more income for our women.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/veravals-fish-on-kashmir-hotel-menus-soon/articleshow/81859346.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: 25 years after elopement, man acquitted of raping ‘girl’ who is his wife now||AHMEDABAD: Twenty-five years after he eloped with his girlfriend, Mahesh Shenna (name changed) has been acquitted of charges of rape and abduction of the girl who is now his wife for over two decades! Last week, a city sessions court granted benefit of the doubt to Shenna in connection with the rape case registered against him in 1996. He was put on trial in 2016 and acquitted after his wife and mother-in-law turned “hostile” during court proceedings. The court also took into consideration that the victim got married to Shenna immediately after the incident and the couple is living happily with two kids. According to the case details, the victim’s mother filed an FIR on October 4, 1996, with Naranpura police accusing Shenna of luring her minor daughter from lawful custody of her parents and of raping her. The youth was arrested, chargesheeted and released on bail. He was put on trial 20 years later. During the trial, the victim told the court that on the day of the alleged incident she had gone to her friend’s place. She said that only because she got late in returning home, her mother filed a complaint against Shenna. The girl asserted that Shenna had neither abducted nor raped her. She even denied having any physical relations with him then. She admitted that she was in love with Shenna and as soon as she became an adult, she married him. The woman said that she is the mother of two kids with Shenna and is living happily with her husband. Victim’s mother too turned hostile and told the court that her daughter was not a minor but was 19 years of age at the time when she reported the incident. This was in contradiction with the prosecution’s claim that the victim was only 16 years of age. An officer from the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) was also examined before the court. The document showed that birth registration had taken place in 1980, but the officer told the court that the victim’s parents might have come for registration two years after the birth. This was a routine practice then. While acquitting Shenna granting him benefit of the doubt, additional sessions judge Priyanka Agarwal observed, “There there is no evidence on record that the victim was raped. Currently, the victim and the accused are living happily as wife and husband with two kids. Hence, it is the duty of the court to see that the lives of the victim and her children are not affected. Considering these facts, the accused cannot be held guilty.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/25-yrs-after-elopement-man-acquitted-of-raping-girl-who-is-his-wife-now/articleshow/81859323.cms||Saeed Khan

Schools reason that several parents are reluctant to allow kids to attend in-person classes, the students have already adjusted to virtual teaching and the new students of classes X and XII will have one year to prepare for the 2022 Board examinations. Some of the school heads also said that since practical examinations are on for the 2021 Boards, taking the lessons online will reduce possibilities of the disease spreading. “We have a fluid situation. We will wait. From April 5 onwards, we will have around 200 students who will take the practical examinations. We can’t have all the children on the same day so they will be given slots. We begin our session on April 12. In order to avoid overcrowding with the board candidates and keeping in mind the rise in cases, we are still unsure whether we’ll be starting online or offline classes for classes IX, X and XII. It will depend on the situation at that time,” said Heritage School principal Seema Sapru. Principal of St James’ School T H Ireland wants to be cautious before the Board examinations start in May. “We have to start the practicals in April. Our new session starts on April 19. But we shall revert to online classes. We have adopted a wait-and-watch policy,” he said. Several heads of schools explained that the students have adapted to online teaching. Though the schools had resumed offline classes, many parents had reservations. “We even had to hold online annual examinations for students of classes IX and XI despite offering the opportunity to sit for the pen-and-paper exams. Thus, when the new academic session begins in April for the students who will be promoted to classes IX, X and XII, online classes will resume,” said a CBSE school principal. Krishna Damani, spokesperson of South Point School, assured students the school will hold hybrid sessions as the classes commence in April. “The offline classes will be mostly for doubt clearing, practicals and written work. Online classes will be for lectures and explanations,” Damani said. The new session at Vivekananda Mission School will start on April 12. “We don’t intend to bring kids on campus though the government has permitted us to reopen in-person classes for students between classes IX and XII. We will do so when the situation improves,” said principal Sarmistha Banerjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/most-schools-lean-towards-e-classes-for-new-session/articleshow/81858672.cms||Somdatta Basu

The bank has said that from July 2021 it will charge customers 25 paise for every SMS alert subject to a maximum of Rs 25 a month. This will not include promotional text messages or messages sent to the customer or the OTP that is sent to authenticate transactions. Premium accounts, salary accounts and basic accounts will be spared charges. In terms of the new regulations, senders of bulk SMS messages will have to first submit a pre-registered template and also subsequent messages will have to match the template failing which the telecom operator will block the messages. The process of authenticating the messages is referred to as ‘scrubbing’. According to telecom industry sources, the charges imposed by the bank reflect the cost of scrubbing messages. Axis Bank accounts for the highest number of mobile banking transactions in the private sector. Among other changes the private bank has increased cash withdrawal fee, reduced fees for attestation and also increased the minimum average balance requirement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/axis-bank-to-charge-for-sms-alerts/articleshow/81861034.cms||Mayur Shetty

The stake was sold to China Merchants & PingAn Infrastructure Phase 1 Equity Investment Fund (Tianjin) — a fund jointly owned by PingAn Insurance and China Merchants. This is the largest transaction for IL&FS since the sale of its wind energy assets to Orix. The transaction involved a combination of cash payment and debt transfer. IL&FS has already received Rs 1,035 crore in Singapore as part of the deal. One of the big gainers from the deal would be the overseas unit of Bank of Baroda, which will receive $88 million. IL&FS Group held a 49% stake in CYEC through its step-down Singapore-based subsidiary ITNL International (IIPL). The balance 51% is held by Chongqing Expressway Group (CEG). In January 2021, the IL&FS management had said it has addressed approximately Rs 32,000 crore of aggregate debt. Since then, it recovered Rs 1,925 crore owed to it for Gurgaon Metro following a favourable court order. Another Rs 1,500 crore is expected to be recovered from the sale of its headquarters at Bandra Kurla Complex where several investors including private equity funds have shown interest. IL&FS said in a statement that it maintains its estimates of addressing aggregate debt of over Rs 56,000 crore by FY22, out of an overall debt of over Rs 99,000 crore (as of October 2018).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ilfs-sells-chinese-road-assets-cuts-rs-2-6k-cr-debt/articleshow/81862891.cms||---

Addressing media persons here at Vishwaswariya Bhawan, Singh said, altogether 198 assistant professors were recruited by NPIU under the Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme - Phase III in 2018. “The tenure of the assistant professor got over on March 31, but the state has decided to continue their services from April 1 on the same service condition under the state plan,” he added. The state will bear the burden of paying the salaries, which is around Rs 18.57 crore annually. “The state has already spent a lot of funds to provide rigorous training to these teachers on skill management, subject up-gradation and other technical skills. The maximum number of teachers are P.hD holders and well-qualified. They are from different parts of the country,” he added. Under the Centre’s scheme, altogether 216 assistant professors were recruited in seven engineering colleges of Bihar- Muzaffarpur Institute of Technology, Bhagalpur College of Engineering, Motihari College of Engineering, Gaya College of Engineering, Darbhanga College of Engineering, Nalanda College of Engineering and Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Institute of Technology, Chapra. The minister said the main objective of the TEQIP is to modernise the laboratory, workshop, education and library of the institute, to make mandatory accreditation of the courses. “Under this project, MTech courses commenced in three engineering colleges- Bhagalpur, Muzaffarpur and Nalanda. To start the MTech courses in the other four institutes from the next academic session we will send the application in November. The renewing of their services would help start a new course,” Singh said. He also said a request is being sent to the Bihar Public Service Commission for the regular appointment of about 3,000 vacant posts, including 1,376 posts of assistant professors in engineering colleges. The state government has also decided that these teachers would be granted five marks every year, subject to a maximum of 25 marks per year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/state-govt-extends-services-of-asst-profs/articleshow/81856031.cms||Faryal Rumi

Doctors as well as paramedical staff has been roped in from Vadodara district too for duties. The administration and the health staff in the city is stretched due to the major rise in Covid-19 cases and at the same time the need to increase the pace of vaccination in the city. Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) will now have help from he health staff of the rural areas. Sources said that around 120 personnel including doctors and paramedical staff has been mobilised from Vadodara district. Officer on special duty for Covid-19 Vinod Rao said that the staff includes 80 vaccinators. “The VMC staff is involved in providing Covid care as part of the SanjivaniAbhiyan,” he said.

Customers complained that they were not able to access their accounts through any of the digital channels like internet banking and mobile banking or even third-party UPI applications. TNN Account holders were adversely impacted as many salaried customers schedule their payments for the first of the month after they receive their salary. “We are undertaking maintenance activities between 2:10pm and 5:40pm on April 1, 2021 to provide a better digital banking experience. During this period, internet banking, Yono Lite, Yono and UPI will be unavailable. We regret the inconvenience caused and request you to bear with us,” the bank had said in a statement. In terms of both — the number of transactions and value, SBI’s mobile banking platform is the single-largest channel for all banking transactions in the country. According to data released by the Reserve Bank of India, SBI recorded 64.8 crore mobile transactions in January 2021, followed by Axis Bank (38.3 crore) and HDFC Bank (21.3 crore). An official in the information technology department of a private bank said that it was unusual for a bank to undertake maintenance activity during banking hours on a working day. Banks typical schedule their maintenance downtime post-midnight when traffic is the lowest. Also, customers are given intimation in advance about the scheduled downtime. The timing of SBI’s maintenance has led bankers to believe that this might not be a scheduled one. Incidentally, SBI’s digital platforms experienced downtime in November 2020 as well the day after HDFC Bank had problems with its digital banking channels. Last month, customers in many banks had a problem doing online transactions due to delay in receiving the one-time passwords (OTPs) on their mobile phones. This was because banks had failed to upgrade systems to move to a new system that allows operators to weed out those sending fraudulent and spam messages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sbis-e-banking-systems-crash-bank-says-upgrade-under-way/articleshow/81863140.cms||---

In the prevailing situation, the settlement period of the old settlement holders in 13 districts has been extended by six months up to September 30 this year. The revenue collected to the tune of Rs 678 crore in the 2020-21 financial year was from the old settlement holders. She said sand mining operations at the ‘ghats’ settled afresh for the purpose has been affected by the continued delay in grant of environmental clearance by the National Green Tribunal (NGT). “As many as 373 sand mining ghats have already been settled with the persons/companies concerned against the settlement amount of Rs 2,677 crore, but the environmental clearance from the NGT is awaited. The department has gone in appeal in the Supreme Court pleading for the early issuance of the environmental clearance by the NGT, but the hearing has yet not begun,” she added. The environmental clearance from the NGT is required to be given to the state government’s new rules and sand mining policy that has been framed in the backdrop of the NGT’s new order on the settlement of ‘ghats’ for the sand mining operations. The department’s principal secretary said that the total revenue collected has been Rs 67 crore more than the collection made in 2019-20. She also said that revenue collection has been more than the target fixed for 27 of the 28 districts, while the revenue collections made in six districts was in the range of 80-100%. Against the revenue worth Rs 62 crore collected in 2019-20 from the brick-kiln activities, the collections made was to the tune of Rs 73 crore in 2020-21. Similarly, the enhanced royalty that the department received from activities in the works departments was Rs 772 crore in 2020-21, which is Rs 248 crore more than the amount collected in 2019-20. The department collected Rs 54 crore by way of penalty charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-delay-in-environmental-clearance-hits-sand-mining-ops/articleshow/81856208.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: In exam season, schools get teachers vaccinated||KOLKATA: Many schools got the first batch of their teachers vaccinated on Thursday. There are more teachers and staffers lined up over the next couple of days so that no one above 45 is left out of the vaccine net. Schools are especially worried about the fact that many teachers have already tested positive across the city and had to be isolated, causing a serious problem in CBSE schools where board practicals have started for Class XII. In most CISCE-affiliated schools, board practicals will start for ISC students from next week. Most teachers have been given invigilation duty and there are many who will go to other schools as board-appointed external examiners for the practicals. At this stage, a teacher falling ill is going to disrupt the exams, schools felt. Many schools are bearing the entire cost of vaccinating their teachers. They have tied up with different clinics and hospitals to vaccinate their teachers. La Martiniere schools have tied up with Belle Vue Clinic and the cost is being borne by the management. On Thursday, 15 teachers got the jab, said Supriyo Dhar, secretary of the schools. “We cannot take the risk with our teachers. On the one hand we have exams and on the other, the new session is about to start. Teachers have to be in the pink of health,” Dhar said. DPS Newtown has also made elaborate arrangements for vaccinating all teachers above 45 in batches, confirmed principal Sonali Sen. “We have made arrangements with Tata Medical Center and our teachers are getting vaccinated in batches according to time slots there,” she said. Many schools are extending the facilities to family members of teachers, too, though the schools are not paying for them. Teachers said that since family members are going at fixed time slots as well, the process is smooth and convenient. Calling their teachers frontline warriors, St Augustine’s Day School, Shyamnagar and Barrackpore, got 22 and 50 teachers vaccinated respectively in the first batch at the school’s own expense, confirmed owner Janet Gasper Chowdhury. “I must thank the school for this gesture,” said Atri Bhattacharya, senior headmistress of the Barrackpore school. A large number of teachers of Loreto schools have also started getting vaccinated. “All our teachers who are above 45 have started taking the vaccine in batches from Thursday. Some with co-morbidities have already taken it,” said Nandini Bhattacharya, co-ordinator of Loreto Elliot Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/in-exam-season-schools-get-teachers-vaccinated/articleshow/81858620.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

He added that the joint venture platform can provide an impetus to the real estate sector by restarting stalled housing projects. Cerberus co-CEO Frank Bruno said, “We can provide tailored solutions in sectors with dislocated funding channels in various forms, such as the purchase of assets, creation of operating & lending platforms, and provision of structured capital to best-in-class operators.” He pointed out that his firm has a long track record of partnering with businesses and properties around the world. The partnership comes at a time when a series of shocks to the Indian residential real estate market have created a significant need for capital. Banks are not able fund developers who have a non-performing asset tag and buyers have turned wary of booking under-construction apartments. HDFC Capital MD and CEO Vipul Roongta said, “HDFC Capital is focused on providing flexible financing solutions to developers in the Indian residential real estate sector.” He said there is a severe shortage of last-mile funding for distressed under-construction real estate projects of even well-intentioned developers. Cerberus has been active in India across numerous verticals since 2019. The firm was one of the bidders for Altico Capital, a real estate financier that went bust.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-cerberus-tie-up-for-stuck-realty/articleshow/81862929.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bahubalis go missing in action, Kgp peaceful||Kharagpur: Giant south Indian-style cut-outs of candidates and banners in English, Bengali and even Telugu—the language has turned lingua franca here, thanks to generations of Andhra Pradesh families living here—dotted the roads and lanes of Kharagpur, which went to polls on Thursday. The election script at Kharagpur Sadar had every ingredient for a potboiler, with the BJP candidate being a Bengali hero and the sitting MLA a friend of MS Dhoni who had played a small part in the former India captain’s biopic. The only thing was missing were the bahubalis, who used to be an integral part of the poll processes here, but not any more. The reason: Ram Babu, a notorious strongman is in jail, and Srinu Naidu, another strongman, was killed three years ago. The third one, Shankar, has been in jail in connection with Srinu’s murder. “There are no baahubalis this election. People in Kharagpur are tired of violence. They have showered me with love. That’s the spirit of Kharagpur,” said Hiranmoy Chatterjee, popularly known as Hiran in Tollywood, who is contesting on a BJP ticket. Trinamool candidate and sitting MLA Pradip Sarkar said, “I am the local hero and now, I am the bahubali. I am confident of my victory,” said Sarkar, outside the Supervisor’s Training Centre booth. As Kharagpur registered 68.3% polls in 331 polling stations till 5pm, very few instances of trouble were reported, perhaps for the first time. Famous for the first IIT campus, the longest railway platform in the country, and the former workplace of Dhoni, Kharagpur has a 35% Telegu population. With the British bringing Andhra people for railway jobs here, parts of the town has earned the title of “Mini Andhra”. The Baahubalis—also, of Andhra origin — rose to prominence from scrapyard sales. Ram Babu helped Congress MLA Gyan Singh Sohanpal retain his seat for six times. Ram Babu was arrested for political murders, and his aide Srinu rose to power. Srinu’s wife Pooja won the 2015 civic poll on a BJP ticket before the two shifted to Trinamool. After Srinu’s murder, Pooja continued to work for the people. “Even today, I visited booths on my scooter. But I did not have any aide to spread fear,” she said. Ram Babu’s other aides are no longer part of polls. “Trinamool leaders didn’t help Peddannayya (big brother).

---||Nashik||Ahmednagar among top-10 Covid-affected districts across India||Nashik: Ahmednagar district has replaced Jalgaon to make it to the list of top-10 Covid-affected districts in the counrty.On March 12, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan had said that Jalgaon was one of the 10 most Covid-affected districts across the country, but on Tuesday he announced the new list with Ahmednagar making an entry.Jalgaon has been excluded from the list, while Nashik is still on it. The situation in Ahmednagar is looking grim as the district has started to add over 1,100 new cases on a daily basis for the past four days.The big difference is the positivity rate of the patients in district. While the positivity rate of Ahmednagar stood at 19% that of Jalgaon was 11.9 per cent. “Around 2,000 people are being tested on a daily basis in Ahmednagar, but this is now being increased as per directions from district collector Rajendra Bhosle,” Sanjeev Belambe, resident medical officer at Ahmednagar Civil Hospital, said. Ahmednagar has 6,385 active cases and the recovery rate is pegged at 93 %, while the case fatality rate (CFR) is at 1.34 %. The doubling rate of the patients is 69.28 days. Meanwhile, Jalgaon district has 11,674 active cases and the recovery rate is 89.7%. The CFR is at 1.91 % and doubling rate is 54.16days. “The positivity rate of the district is very high hence all measures are being taken to bring it down. This is the reason that the testing is also being ramped up,” Belambe said. He added that the administration has decided to be strict on those opting for home quarantine to ensure that they keep themselves away from coming into contact with the other people.“Since they do not know if they are positive or not, they should be away from everyone till the results are out,” Belambe said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ahmednagar-among-top-10-covid-affected-districts-across-india/articleshow/81784361.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Pune||Senior cop to inquire into ‘wrong’ charge||Pune: The Bombay high court has directed the Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner to appoint a high-ranking officer to conduct an inquiry into the allegation by a woman that the Dehu Road police had wrongly registered an FIR of rape against her neighbour in March last year in a personal dispute. The woman had filed an affidavit before the HC during the hearing of an anticipatory bail plea filed by her neighbour after a Pune court in November last year vacated an interim protection and rejected his pre-arrest bail plea. “The circumstances in this case are quite disturbing. There are allegations against the police officers made by the first informant (complainant). There is a possibility that the informant has made contrary statements and changed her version through her affidavit. The matter cannot be just ignored like this. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct an inquiry to take the matter to its logical end,” Justice Sarang Kotwal of the HC said in a recent order. According to the FIR lodged on March 13, 2020, the man had forced the woman into a physical relationship in January 2019 and repeated the act on subsequent occasions by threatening that he would harm her children. Later in her affidavit, the woman said she had complained against the accused about some personal dispute, “but the police wrongly applied rape and other criminal charges”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/senior-cop-to-inquire-into-wrong-charge/articleshow/81858609.cms||Vishwas Kothari

District officials informed that the couple visited various holy places along the banks of Narmada on Wednesday and Thursday and also paid homage to the river by performing aarti. On the first day of his visit, Chouhan visited the Naramda Sanskrit Pathshala and Nilkantheshwar Temple at Jhadeshwar. The students of Pathshala conducted a ‘puja’ and ‘havan’ which was attended by the MP CM and his wife. Later, the two did meditation on banks of the Narmada. On Thursday, Chouhan visited the holy Narmada Sangam, the ending point of the river where it meets the meeting of Gulf of Cambay near Lakhabava at Dahej. Chouhan also visited a satsang Program at Manan Ashram on the bank of Narmada and took the blessings of Swami Tadrupanandji, who has authored more than 30 spiritual books. “I am fortunate to be here to experience the power of holy Narmada ‘Maiya’. We were keen to perform puja at Narmada Sangam, where river and sea meet at the Gulf of Cambay. India has a rich spiritual heritage. Our culture respects everyone, including those who have criticized us,” Chouhan said after his visit to the holy places. “I have strong bonding and affection for Narmada ‘Maiya’ as was I born in a village on the bank of this river.

---||Trichy||Six arrested in connection with cash seizure case||Trichy: In a twist to the case relating to the seizure of Rs 1 crore unaccounted money near Pettavaithalai in Trichy, rural police arrested six people on Thursday on charges of committing dacoity. The identities of the arrested people, natives of Srirangam, were not revealed. They have been remanded in judicial custody. Though police confirmed the arrests, they remained tight-lipped about the details such as the claimant of the money, the bearers and the amount. The incident at Pettavathalai on March 23 night has triggered a controversy leading to the transfer of Trichy collector S Sivarasu, superintendent of police P Rajan and Srirangam constituency returning officer Nishant Krishna. Police and the income tax department conducted an enquiry with T Ravichandran, 51 of Musiri, A Sathiyaraja, 52 of Musiri, T Jayaseelan, 25 of Musiri and M Sivakumarof Musiri who were found standing near the spot with a car that was owned by AIADMK MLA and Musiri candidate M Selvarasu’s son S Ramamoorthy. Pettavaithalai police filed a case against unknown people under Section 102 of CrPc after the four people denied any connection with the seized cash. The arrests came a few days after a special team formed by the newly-appointed police superintendent, A Myilvaganan, intensified the investigation. Sources said that police altered the old case of cash seizure into a dacoity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/six-arrested-in-connection-with-cash-seizure-case/articleshow/81861688.cms||---

---||Trichy||Sans mask, public fined, politicos let off||Trichy: Even as fresh Covid-19 cases are going up and people stepping out without masks are being penalised, the authorities seem to be turning a blind eye towards cadres and functionaries of political parties who flout norms at will during election campaigns. Most of the cadres are seen walking in groups during campaigning through the narrow streets without face masks. Apart from visiting the streets in open vehicles, candidates irrespective of the political party also directly interact with residents in congested localities where campaigning vehicles cannot enter. Residents greet the candidates by draping silk shawls and even welcome them with aarathi standing close to each other. No facemasks are seen among the public and the party representatives on such occasions. This when residents complain they are intercepted by authorities during enforcement of the model code of conduct and even penalised if they are seen without a facemask inside the car. “Authorities turn the other way when they see goods vehicles being used to transport political cadres, obviously travelling jampacked without facemasks. But when it comes to the common people, even those sleeping inside a moving car are woken up and penalised,” R Srinivasan, a frequent commuter to Thanjavur said. This double standard in enforcing the public health act has irked locals. “Just because the campaigning is happening in open space, it does not mean that the infection will not spread. Facemask is mandatory in congested streets too,” a senior health official managing Covid19 countermeasures said. While the candidates of a few political parties wear facemasks, the cadres surrounding them rarely adhere to it. However, city health officer (CHO) M Yazhini denied there was inaction against political parties which flout rules. “True, just like the public, the political cadres also don’t wear facemasks. But we are not showing any partiality in enforcement. Cases were booked against political parties through the city police,” she said. Trichy corporation officials claimed that sanitary officials are sensitising the parties to wear facemasks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/sans-mask-public-fined-politicos-let-off/articleshow/81861749.cms||Deepak Karthik

Though the turnout in terms of percentage achievement was about 40% but in absolute numbers, 2.09 lakh vaccinations in a day are significant. As per data (updated till 8 pm) provided by the state health department, the number included both new registrations who had come for their first dose and also the previously registered beneficiaries who reported for their second dose. Different vaccination sites reported an encouraging footfall but the beneficiaries complained of practical problems like single line for first timers and second dose seekers. A number of elderly stated that they had to wait for longer time for their turn on account of higher footfall. Additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad reiterated the importance of Covid-19 and urged people to come forward for the vaccination. “Vaccination is a win-win move against coronavirus. The available data indicates that while on one hand, 99.5% of the people who took both the doses of the vaccine are safe from the infection. And the miniscule proportion who contracted the infection despite the vaccination were in the safe zone as the infection was mild and the persons required no hospitalisation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/over-2l-get-jab-on-first-day-of-phase-4-11-lakh-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/81863950.cms||Shailvee Sharda

---||Chennai||EC slaps 48-hour campaign ban on A Raja for speech against Edappadi K Palaniswami||CHENNAI: The Election Commission of India on Thursday debarred former Union minister A Raja from campaigning for 48hours with immediate effect. It also delisted him from the DMK’s star campaigners list for violation of model code of conduct over his alleged derogatory remarks against chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami during an election campaign on March 26 in Thousand Lights constituency. The Madras high court, later in the day, refused the DMK deputy general secretary’s plea for an urgent hearing. Senior advocate R Shanmugasundaram, who made an urgent mention before the first bench headed by Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee, requested the court to take up Raja’s challenge against the EC order on Friday, a court holiday. The bench rejected the plea. Acting on a complaint from the AIADMK, chief electoral officer of Tamil Nadu Satyabrata Sahoo had sent a report to the EC. Separately, the central crime branch police had registered a case against the DMK MP under various sections of the IPC and Representation of People Act, 1951. Raja had submitted an interim reply on Wednesday to the EC denying the allegations and had asked for a copy of the full text of his alleged speech. He had also asked for a copy of the complaint filed by the AIADMK, and requested an opportunity to give a detailed reply to the EC and personal hearing with an advocate. “The commission has considered your reply and the same was not found satisfactory. It was also observed that asking for the above said details and more time to represent is an attempt to buy time, which the commission cannot afford to give in the midst of elections,” ECI secretary Malay Mallick said in the order. The commission advised the DMK leader to be watchful and not to make intemperate, indecent, derogatory, obscene remarks and lower the dignity of women in future during election campaigns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ec-slaps-48hr-campaign-ban-on-a-raja-for-speech-against-eps/articleshow/81861765.cms||---
---||Agra||Senior doc tests positive for Covid a month after second dose of jab||AGRA: A month after taking the second last dose of Covid-19 vaccine, a senior doctor of Sarojini Naidu Medical College (SNMC) in Agra tested positive for the infection. The 56-year-old gynecologist was administered the last dose of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, known as Covishield in India, on February 26. On Sunday, vice-chancellor of Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University Ashok Mittal had tested Covid-19 positive, nine days after getting the first dose of the vaccine. Chief medical officer of Agra RC Pandey said, “The doctor had been suffering from mild fever. Her throat swab sample was sent for RT-PCR testing at microbiology lab in SNMC. She tested Covid positive on Wednesday. One of her close relatives has also tested positive for the infection. They are in home isolation and being provided with the required treatment. People who came in their contact will also be tested.” Confirming that the gynecologist was administered the second jab of coronavirus vaccine in February, CMO said, “Vaccines don’t work instantly. It takes a few weeks for the body to build up immunity after receiving a dose. The action of vaccines also depends upon health parameters which varies from person to person.” SNMC principal Dr Sanjay Kala said, “The reason behind the senior doctor testing Covid-19 positive may be heavy viral load or a new Covid-19 strain. Researches are in progress to check the impact of vaccines on the new strains of coronavirus. The case studies conducted by the health ministry suggest that the effects of Covid-19 in people who tested positive after vaccination is up to 72 percent less as compared to the ones not vaccinated so far.” Health department in Agra district is on alert after three people were detected with South African strain (N501Y,E484K) and another individual with new mutated strain on Friday. Meanwhile, a total of 15 people tested Covid-19 positive in Agra district on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/senior-doc-tests-positive-for-covid-a-month-after-second-dose-of-jab/articleshow/81855594.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Trichy||2 years on, Gaja effect looms over nine delta seats||Trichy: Two years after it wreaked havoc in some delta districts, cyclone Gaja looms over the fate of candidates in nine assembly constituencies in the region going to the polls. The cataclysmic events of November 16, 2018 and the response of the government and the elected representatives to them have been campaign themes this time too. If complaints of inadequate compensation and dissatisfaction over relief work had determined the fortunes of candidates in these constituencies in the 2019 general election, the same parameters are likely to impact this election too. The nine constituencies are Vedaranyam, Thiruthuraipoondi (reserved), Pattukkottai, Mannargudi, Orathanadu, Peravurani, Gandharvakkottai (reserved), Alangudi and Aranthangi spread over Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur, Thanjavur and Pudukkottai districts. DMK, communists and MNM have been projecting “inadequate compensation” as a campaign point. In Nagapattinam, MNM leader Kamal Haasan recently took a jibe at the chief minister for surveying the region on helicopter at that time instead of travelling through road. “The destruction was not properly assessed to sanction appropriate compensation and the MLA of the ruling party failed to take up our demands. People still recall the lapses during the disaster,” Nimal Raghavan, a voter of Peravurani constituency, said. Of the nine constituencies that sustained heavy damage, five were held by AIADMK and four by DMK. AIADMK has dropped three of its sitting MLAs in the region and allotted one seat to its ally TMC while DMK has renominated three of its four sitting MLAs in Mannargudi, Orathanadu and Alangudi. Thiruthuraipoondi (reserved) was allotted to CPI. “We are raising the disaster management as the ruling party did no fulfil its assurances. People did not get adequate compensation,” M Selvarasu, CPI MP of Nagapattinam, told TOI. In the 2019 general election, the Gaja factor gave solid leads by 20,000 to 60,000 votes for DMK alliance candidates in each of the affected constituencies. Handlooms minister O S Manian is the only sitting AIADMK MLA to contest again from the affected segment. “Bridges were reconstructed in Vedaranyam and people were given new houses. Our performance post-Gaja has only been better,” Advocate T V Subbaiyan, Vedaranyam union secretary of AIADMK, said. ————————————————————- Constituencies impacted by the cyclone Gaja: 1) Vedaranyam 2) Thiruthuraipoondi (reserved) 3) Pattukkottai 4) Mannargudi 5) Orathanadu 6) Peravurani 7) Gandharvakkottai (reserved) 8) Alangudi 9) Aranthangi Gaja hit constituencies 2016 vs 2021: Worst hit assembly segments: 9 Constituencies won by DMK in 2016: 4 Constituencies won by AIADMK in 2016: 5 DMK candidates recontesting in 2021: 3 (1 allotted to alliance) AIADMK candidates recontesting in 2021: 1 (3 dropped, 1 allotted to alliance) Seats won in the 2019 general election (assembly constituency-wise): Worst hit assembly segments: 9 DMK: 9 AIADMK: 0 Winning margin: 50,000 votes - 60,000 votes Factors influencing: 1.Compensation provided 2.Fieldwork by representatives in the aftermath 3.Status of promises PIC: File pictures of uprooted trees in cyclone Gaja in delta districts EOM||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/2-years-on-gaja-effect-looms-over-nine-delta-seats/articleshow/81861787.cms||Deepak Karthik

The project will make way for a better infrastructure and boost demand for housing as commuting time is set to come down to less than an hour at present and eventually, 45 minutes, said real estate players. “The biggest advantage of the DME is the reduction in commute time from over two hours to just 45 minutes. It will also open up the market for home buyers who may be working in Delhi but want to stay in Meerut. The pandemic has created a need for more and more people to purchase their own homes. The fact that one can buy a home at a far lesser cost than Delhi-NCR and yet be in the capital city limits within 45 minutes’ drive time, will be a big boon for real estate development,” said Manish Aggarwal, managing director, North & East India, JLL India. “Road network is one of the key factors that helps in boosting the growth of real estate in any city. Infrastructure and road development makes way for good connectivity of a location, civic amenities and social infrastructure facilities such as schools, colleges, healthcare, entertainment, dedicated water, electricity supply and public gardens. Also, we have always observed that not only do people give preference to the project at such locations but the resale value of houses in such areas increases,” said Punit Agarwal, MD and CEO of Nirvana Realty. Rajendra Agarwal, BJP MP from Meerut, said, “The DME will bring development not only in Meerut but across west UP. This will boost investments in Meerut and NCR as more companies would like to open their offices and stores here.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/dme-to-push-up-housing-demand-in-ncr-say-realtors/articleshow/81855614.cms||Ishita Bhatia

The total collection from various taxes reached Rs 301 crore — against the annual revenue target of Rs 439 crore. The property tax department garnered the highest revenue while the water tax had over 50% shortfall in the collection.The officials said they will need at least one more day to compute the department-wise tax revenue.Sanjay Sarnaik, the chief accountant of KMC said, “The pandemic was the major factor in the revenue shortfall. However, in the last few days, attracted by the concession scheme, the property tax revenue was the highest when compared to other tax receipts. Due to the Covid outbreak, many developers had delayed the commencement of new building projects, which hit the revenue we receive through building permit fees. Now, in the coming year, a large number of projects will get approval and so the revenue of KMC will increase accordingly.”Every year, the tax revenue has remained around 85% to 90%. For the next financial year, the KMC has set higher targets for property tax and water tax anticipating that the defaulters will clear their dues in the next financial year.“The process of taxing new and untaxed properties is going on. A large amount of dues especially of the big establishments is pending, which we are hopeful to recover during next financial year,” said Sarnaik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-civic-body-falls-32-short-in-revenue-collection/articleshow/81852617.cms||---

The average wholesale price of onions declined marginally to Rs 850 per quintal as against Rs 900 per quintal on the last working day (March 26). According to an APMC official, the arrival of onions has started in all the onion growing belts across the country. “But the demand in domestic and export market has reduced as compared to the supply. The rise in supply in other onion growing pockets in other states has led to drop in demand for Nashik onions. This is the reason behind the drop in average wholesale price of onions,” he said. Meanwhile,the minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices were recorded at Rs 600 and Rs1,100 per quintal, respectively on Thursday where around 22,000 quintal of the produce were auctioned. Currently, the onions arriving in the market are of both fresh late kharif and summer onions and they are getting almost the same price. Out of the 22,000 quintal auctioned on Thursday, 20,000 quintal were kharif onions and the remaining 2,000 quintal were summer onions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/onion-auction-begins-at-lasalgaon-after-five-days/articleshow/81852708.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Chennai||Puducherry-Aadhaar case: Madras HC rejects BJP claim||CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Thursday refused to accept the claim of the BJP that mobile numbers of voters linked to Aadhaar which were used for election campaigning were collected by their karyakartas (party workers) going door-to-door in Puducherry. The first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said that the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) should answer how information furnished to it by citizens in the hope that the confidentiality would be preserved had been breached. The court also made it clear that the Election Commission of India (ECI) should deal with the perceived breach of code of conduct without putting a lid on the issue and a separate criminal investigation initiated against the party should go on. The court passed the orders on a public interest litigation filed by A Anand, president of the Puducherry unit of the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI). The petitioner has alleged that the local BJP candidates had obtained the cell phone numbers illegally from Aadhaar data and were creating WhatsApp groups in their respective constituencies for election campaigning. Opposing the allegation, the BJP contended that phone numbers of voters it used to send propaganda SMSes had been collected by the party's ‘karyakartas’ over a period of time and ‘not stolen from Aadhaar data’. “All such numbers are available in the public domain. The party engaged the services of bulk SMS senders by paying them,” senior advocate V Kathic said, representing BJP. On its part, the UIDAI also submitted that Aadhaar data had not been compromised or shared with anyone. “We have found no tampering of records whatsoever,” UIDAI’s counsel V Chandrasekar said. "Information collected by the UIDAI is not used for any purpose other than the generation of Aadhaar numbers and authentication.

---||Trichy||Don’t vote for me, for I will bring you projects||Trichy: A 34-year-old independent woman candidate contesting in Manachanallur constituency in Trichy has been grabbing the attention of voters with her slogan, “do not vote for me”. For, if they voted for her and she won, she will bring projects beneficial to the constituency, says she. R Sudha, a resident of Pichandar Koil on the outskirts of Trichy city and a grocery store, was allotted ‘laptop’ as election symbol. She has been going around canvassing votes in her unconventional style and distributing a pamphlet listing out 20 promises. Penalising eligible voters who fail to cast their vote, banning candidates who have won twice from contesting again and providing pension to all senior citizens are among her top promises. But what raises eyebrows is her word to ensure a separate country for Tamils, mostly to accommodate the Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora. “Listing the promises, I tell people that voting for me will help them get such welfare schemes, so do not vote for me,” Sudha said. She believes that a negative campaign will make the public think again and vote for her. “Although I know that my chances of winning are thin, the promises I made such as dismissing a government servant from service if caught demanding a bribe will send the right message to voters and candidates,” she added. A BBA degree holder, she is supported by her husband P Kathiresan, a teacher, who helps in her campaign.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/dont-vote-for-me-for-i-will-bring-you-projects/articleshow/81861866.cms||Deepak Karthik

Fire tenders were rushed to the spot immediately, and it took over two hours to douse the blaze. There was no one in the hall when the fire spread. The reason behind the fire is yet to be ascertained but a probe has been set up in the matter. “A massive fire engulfed the Jain Vivaah Mandap in Sadar area here on Thursday afternoon at around 12:15pm. Three fire tenders were rushed to the spot to douse the blaze. It took over two hours to extinguish it,” said Santosh Kumar, Meerut chief fire officer. Nobody was inside the banquet hall when the incident took place and hence no injuries were reported, he added. “Prima facie, it looks like the fire occurred due to a spark from a cigarette, which might have been thrown by a passer-by. Since the entry of the banquet hall was made of bamboo and had a curtain too, the fire spread quickly,” said Kumar. The Jain Vivaah Mandap is adjacent to Balaji Mandir here. The banquet belongs to one Prateek Jain. A probe has been set up to ascertain the reason behind the fire, said Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/massive-fire-engulfs-wedding-banquet-hall-in-meerut/articleshow/81855663.cms||Ishita Bhatia
---||Nashik||EoIs invited for Nashik’s Metro Neo coaches||Nashik: Proper lighting, air-conditioning, WiFi, CCTV cover, press buttons at the doors, onboard passenger information system (PIS), fire and smoke detection gadgets etc. will be some of the key features of the swanky coaches being planned for the ambitious Nashik Metro Neo project. Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation (MahaMetro), the implementing agency for the project, has drawn up the details of the coach design. MahaMetro has now invited expression of interest (EoI) from interested firms for the manufacture, supply, commission and maintenance of the rubber-tyred trolley buses that would be run on the two corridors on electricity drawn from overhead lines. Interested firms must submit their EoIs by May 5. MahaMetro will initially run 50 coaches on the 22km corridor I — Gangapur Road-Nashik Road railway station — and 14 coaches on the 10km corridor II between Gangapur Road and Mumbai Naka. The carrying capacity of the coaches on corridor I will be 250, while the coaches in corridor II will have 200 carrying capacity. The length of the coaches in corridor I will be 20m, while the coaches in corridor II will be about 15m. The height and width of the coaches will be 3.5m and 2.55m respectively. The coaches will run at a speed of 70km per hour. There will be proper signage within the coaches for passenger safety and information. There will be a separate compartment for coach drivers with several indicators. The March 22 notice issued by MahaMetro’s procurement department inviting EoIs said the trolley buses have to be manufactured in modern design using either light aluminium or stainless steel. The coach doors must have press buttons (inside and outside) that will allow passengers to open and close the doors when the coaches stop. Emergency evacuation system must also be in place. “The standard specifications of Metro Neo system as issued by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs are to be complied by the supplier,” said MahaMetro in its notice. The Rs 2,092 crore Nashik Metro Neo project is a unique model that the Centre has come up with for tier-II and tier-III cities. Metro Neo projects can be taken up at a much lower cost. Nashik is the first city where such a project is being implemented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/eois-invited-for-nashiks-metro-neo-coaches/articleshow/81852674.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Lucknow||4 cops booked for framing two in fake ATM loot case||Lucknow: A CB-CID probe has indicted a police team which had framed a restaurateur and his helper in a fake ATM loot case. After their lie was uncovered, the Aliganj police registered a case against four policemen-- sub-inspector Nepal Singh and Veerbhan Singh and constables Pankaj and Mithilesh. ACP Aliganj, Akhilesh Singh, confirmed that a case had been registered against the four policemen. They were booked under the charges of public servant disobeying law, public servant framing incorrect record, punishment for wrongful confinement and arms act. The issue dates back to 2012, when restaurant owner Manish of Madiaon took on rent a shop owned by one Santosh in Ahibaranpur locality for Rs 12,000 per month. Santosh is the son of a retired police officer. Manish employed one Irfan alias Raju, who is physically challenged, as a helper. In due course of time, Manish and Santosh developed differences. As Manish agreed to purchase the shop for Rs 30 lakh, he gave Rs 24 lakh as advance to Santosh, but he allegedly reneged from his promise. Manish alleged that Santosh and his brother Arvind started bullying him for registering the shop in their name. “Santosh took the help of SI Nepal Sigh, who was then in charge of Galla Mandi in Aliganj. On July 15, Irfan and me were summoned by Singh, who along with his colleagues gave a third degree torture to us. They took us to Aliganj police station, where we were shown as ATM thieves. Cops also showed the recovery of a pistol from us and stated in their report that Irfan and me fired at them,” Manish alleged. He said they were granted bail after being in jail for four months. “We both were arrested again and were sent to prison, this time under Gangster Act,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/4-cops-booked-for-framing-two-in-fake-atm-loot-case/articleshow/81863969.cms||---

The Shiromani Punjabi award winner wrote several books such as ‘Putt Daryawan De’ and ‘Amai’. His poem ‘Dil tutt de hawawan de, boond-boond tars gaye asin putt daryawan de (winds are heartbroken, and the sons of rivers yearning for a drop)’ was a rage in 1957. He also wrote a book about late professor Puran Singh and his poetry. University’s Guru Granth Sahib department head Sarabjinder Singh remembered Grewal as: “Punjab’s legend poet who also knew English, Persian, and Bengali, besides Punjabi. He had studied at Rabindranath Tagore University and was loved by everyone.” Sikh scholar Grewal was part of ‘Bhootwara’ group of Patiala intellectuals. The university has a World Punjabi Centre, the director of which, Balkar Singh, was close to Grewal. He said: “Grewal was from Sakrodi village in Sangrur’s Bhawanigarh area. The family shifted to Patiala with his father, domestic help in the palace of Maharajas Bhupinder Singh and Yadavindra Singh. A classical Patialvi, he wrote each poem as his first. ‘Tera ambran ch na likhya’ was his first book before the famous ‘Amai’. Born in 1941, he is survived by three sons. Grewal had won the state’s Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji Achievers Award on the 550th birthday of Sikhism’s founder in November 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/patiala-loses-poet-grewal-silence-in-bhootwara/articleshow/81861857.cms||---

The EC said EVMs were either replaced or fixed. Trinamool MP Mahua Moitra tweeted, “More than 150 EVM machines malfunctioning since Phase II voting started this morning. Wish EC had put half as much effort into ensuring no EVM glitches as it did into transferring police officials.” Trinamool Bankura candidate, actor Sayantika Banerjee, began the day, visiting Municipality High School, from where multiple complaints about malfunctioning EVMs came. She tweeted: “You cannot deny the support and love through conspiracy. Today morning, by 7.30am, EVMs malfunctioned at booths 114 to 119, a belt where TMC is strong. Several mothers and sisters left without casting their votes. These are our safe booths. The EVMs are definitely a conspiracy.” At Saradamani School, Banerjee spent 15 minutes complaining about EVMs, leading Bankura observer Harish Nayar to rush to the spot. She alleged central forces tried to stop her when she went to check the EVMs in Bankura Town.  At Barjora, similar complaints poured in from the morning. “At Barjora Girls’ High School, around 50 women could not vote as the EVM malfunctioned for over 45 minutes. Similar cases have been reported from Kapistha, Komla and Pakhanna. In all, 15 EVMs malfunctioned on an average interval of 45-70 minutes. Taldangra, too, reported EVM malfunctioning from Simlapal, Gotkanali and Laksmisagar. Trinamool said they decided to inform their headquarters in Kolkata and move the EC,” said a senior state leader. “At several booths, there were issues with proper lights and the elderly could hardly figure out the button they wanted to press,” Trinamool Bishnupur candidate Archita Bid told TOI. MP Derek O Brien in his complaint to EC on “booth capturing” in East Midnapore alleged BJP workers tried to take control EVMs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ec-gets-150-evm-complaints-tmc-claims-booth-capturing/articleshow/81861911.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

As one trader tested positive last week, a random sampling covering around 118 people identified four more cases. Subsequently, the civic body collected 60 samples from the fish market adjacent to the Gandhi market, and the results are awaited. Meanwhile, health officials have started inspecting the supermarkets. In the last two days, around 140 samples were collected from two major supermarkets in Ariyamangalam and Palpannai. Civic body sources said that they are considering even shutting down the complexes that report multiple positive cases to limit the spread. “Early intervention, isolation, mandatory face masks adherence and social distancing are the only tools we have to combat the pandemic. Although the situation is under control, we urge the people to stay cautious,” M Yazhini, city health officer (CHO) said. While the total testing has been doubled from 850 to around 1,700, at least 100 people are tested through random sampling every day. Even asymptomatic people with non-communicable diseases (NCD) are tested in primary health centres as part of early intervention measures. Mobile medical units have come in handy for health officials to collect random samples in hotspots. The 18 PHCs are also collecting a minimum of 80 samples per day. “Since we have increased the testing, there are more fresh cases being reported,” Yazhini added. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corpn-scales-up-random-testing/articleshow/81861893.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maha gets over 3 lakh vaccinated in a single day, Mumbai 55,000||MUMBAI: Vaccination for all above 45 years began on a high note as the state and the city registered record turnouts on Thursday, giving a much-needed nudge to a drive that was losing steam. Maharashtra recorded over 3lakh vaccinations while Mumbai breached 55,000, the highest in a single day for both. In Mumbai, over 37,000 from 45 to 59 years got vaccinated, a significant jump from the ,000-5,000 from the same age group with co-morbidities who were turning up. Urging districts to prioritize immunisation in areas facing a surge in cases, principal health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas said in a circular that field units must decide if they want to cover wards/villages sequentially or eligible groups in the shortest time. He asked districts to try and exhaust the recent vaccine consignment (of 26.77lakh doses) in 5-7 days by pushing daily vaccinations to 4lakh. The enthusiasm to get the jab among those above 45 was palpable across inoculation centres. Nesco jumbo centre had a queue building up at 8am. By noon, it vaccinated over 2,100. Goregaon residents Ashok Yadav, Mithilesh Pandey and Nandkumar Shetty said they had been eagerly waiting to take the shot and more so since the surge. “Our housing complex has many cases. The co-morbidity relaxation was much needed,” said Yadav (48), who lost his father to Covid in February. Vile Parle resident Prasanna Kamath, 46, said he could take the shot 10 days ago because of a comorbidity, but his wife Shweta, 45, qualified only after the relaxation. Sangeeta Biswas, 54, a teacher from Goregaon, and her neighbour Gia Pereira, 50, were also among recipients. “Sooner or later, we all have to return to our regular work routine and vaccine is the only way to do that,” she said. Jyotika Kanuga, 45, said the relaxation should have come earlier but better late than never. Dean of Nesco vaccination facility Dr Neelam Andrade said walk-ins rose in the last 10 days. As per BMC data, 55,870 took the shot on Thursday, including 37,563 above 45, 10,576 senior citizens, 5,423 frontliners and 2,308 health workers. Mumbai has administered 12.08lakh doses, including 1.54lakh second doses. The city has an estimated 40lakh people in the targeted age groups. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said, “We are hoping to touch 1lakh vaccinations in days to come.”  Maharashtra has so far given 65lakh doses. Dr Balakrishna Adsul, dean of SevenHills Hospital, said, “We are expecting a big turnout on Friday since there is a long weekend after for people to recover from any mild aftereffects.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maha-gets-over-3-lakh-vaccinated-in-a-single-day-mumbai-55000/articleshow/81864069.cms||Sumitra Debroy

According to Game, the revenue department of all five districts — Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon, Nandurbar and Ahmednagar — have collected Rs 658 crore. Also, the land revenue collected from the five districts exceeded the target, while the collection from minor minerals was just 80%. “The land revenue collected was Rs 280 crore against a target of Rs 253 crore and the revenue collected from minor minerals was Rs 378 crore against the target of Rs 475 crore,” Game said, adding that the employees had worked hard in the achieving the goals despite the pandemic situation. Nandurbar district came up with the best performance in collection of land revenue by achieving 169% of the set target of Rs 16.12 crore. Meanwhile, Jalgaon district put up best performance in collection of revenue from minor minerals by achieving the target of Rs 105 crore. The overall best performance was by Nashik district as it achieved 129% of the set land revenue target and 85% of the minor mineral revenue. The total collection was Rs 232 crore or around 101% of the target of Rs 225 crore. Collector of Nashik Suraj Mandhare said the target set by the government was about 1.5 times more than the target for the year 2019-20. “The lockdown imposed due to Covid-19 in the beginning of the financial year had put brakes on all the work. But after the lockdown was lifted, our employees started contributing towards increasing the revenue along with managing Covid situation,” Mandhare said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-division-manages-90-of-its-revenue-target/articleshow/81852740.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Akalis to bank on former dissident to get Ajnala seat||Ajnala (Amritsar): Despite the vitriol unleashed by SAD president against dissidents in SAD (Taksali), one of them has found favour in the party again. Shiromani Akali Dal will bank on former dissident-turned-loyalist Amarpal Singh Bony in the assembly elections from Ajnala constituency. Sukhbir Badal announced his name during the third Punjab Mangda Jawab rally held here on Thursday. Addressing the rally, Sukhbir heaped praise on Amarpal for the huge gathering and announced his name for the ensuing assembly elections. Bony, along with party veterans, including his father Dr Rattan Singh Ajnala, Ranjit Singh Brahampura and Sewa Singh Sekhwan parted ways with SAD to launch SAD (Taksali) on December 16, 2018. However, after having failed to either tap the vote bank it shared with SAD or make a significant dent in the Badal camp, which could have forced the latter to strike a truce, Bony sought his lost political ground in the Badal camp. He joined them again in February 2020. Since then, he has been seen sharing the stage with SAD as well as Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) leaders. Earlier, Sukhbir had announced the name of Virsa Singh Valtoha and his own candidature from Bhikhiwind and Jalalabad assembly seats respectively. “SAD (T) had nothing new to offer to its vote bank. Their main grudge with Parkash Singh Badal was that he had been promoting nepotism and had adjusted his son, daughter, daughter-in-law etc in the party but they (dissidents) themselves had been doing the same, so the charges couldn’t hold for long,” said a senior Akali source who didn’t wish to be named. Besides, sources said that even the staunchest of the Akalis were comfortable with Congress legislator Harpartap Singh Ajnala, because of which the Akalis had to “work hard in the constituency.” SAD (Taksali) president Ranjit Singh Brahampura said Amarpal Singh could have his own reasons to rejoin the Badals. However, he said his father Rattan Singh Ajnala was inactive in politics. “He has been silent for long but he will eventually help his son,” observed Brahampurra . Despite the major fissure in the party after Bony and his father left, Brahampura claimed that SAD (T) offered major opposition to SAD. Brahampura also hinted at the emergence of a “third force” ahead of the assembly elections. “Feelers are being sent by AAP leaders and it is yet to reach any decision,” he said. Meanwhile, former president of Ajnala nagar panchayat, Jorawar Singh said he, along with a few Akali leaders, had boycotted Sukhbir’s rally. “Party workers and leaders are being singled out for raising their voice within the party platform but there are many like us who can’t have a dictatorial leadership and this is how we express our resentment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/akalis-to-bank-on-former-dissident-to-get-ajnala-seat/articleshow/81861925.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Chandigarh||Farmers protest against Dushyant in Hisar||Hisar: For the second day in a row, Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala faced a protest by farmers outside the Hisar airport on Thursday. Dushyant arrived at the airport to inaugurate various development projects, worth around Rs 39 crore. When farmers, who have been protesting against the agricultural laws for the past few months, learned about his visit, they gathered outside the airport in large numbers, carrying black flags and raising slogans against him. They demanded the withdrawal of the Centre’s three farm laws. Such was the opposition that the deputy CM could not even go to his own house located in the Urban Estate. He could not even visit the grain market to take stock of procurement process. Interestingly, the district administration had not even released the schedule of his programme to avoid the protesting farmers. Dushyant landed at the airport around 12.30pm, but by then a large number of farmers had gathered outside. Police personnel were deployed to prevent any untoward incident, and even kept a fire bigrade, water cannon and Vajra vehicle on standby. The protesters did not even wait for the JJP leader to walk out and started showing black flags to the chopper itself. The deputy CM held a meeting of administrative officials at the airport itself. When it was clear that he could not go to the mini secretariat by road, he took the helicopter to reach the Haryana Agricultural University (HAU) centre, from where he drove to the mini secretariat, where he virtually inaugurated and laid the foundation stone of projects. Meanwhile, the farmers gathered near his residence at Urban Estate and broke the barricades put up by police. From the mini secretariat, Dushyant went to international boxer Pinky Jangra’s house in Azad Nagar to congratulate her on her wedding, where he was again shown black flags. From here he went to his maternal grandmother’s house in Sector 15 before returning to HAU centre to take the chopper. The deputy CM inaugurated three-lane railway overbridge on Rewari-Bathinda railway line for Adampur, Barwala and Agroha areas , which has been constructed at a cost of about Rs 14 crores. He also laid the foundation stone of two-lane railway over bridge to be built near the grain market on Adampur-Darauli road besides inaugurating a lift at the advocate’s chamber virtually. Other projects inaugurated by him included the sub-divisional level administrative building and residential complex at Barwala BOX Second phase of airport expansion by May 2022 Dushyant said the construction work of the second phase of Hisar airport, which began on February 5, 2021, should be completed by the end of May 2022. He also discussed setting up flying clubs for pilot training and expansion of air taxis, currently started from Hisar to Dehradun, Dharamshala and Chandigarh, as part of the Udan scheme, a regional airport development and regional connectivity Scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-protest-against-dushyant-in-hisar/articleshow/81861897.cms||---

As per BMC data, 55,870 took the shot on Thursday, including 37,563 above 45, 10,576 senior citizens, 5,423 frontliners and 2,308 health workers. Mumbai has administered 12.08lakh doses, including 1.54lakh second doses. The city has an estimated 40lakh people in the targeted age groups. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said, “We are hoping to touch 1lakh vaccinations in days to come.”  Maharashtra has so far given 65lakh doses. Dr Balakrishna Adsul, dean of SevenHills Hospital, said, “We are expecting a big turnout on Friday since there is a long weekend after for people to recover from any mild aftereffects.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maha-gets-over-3-lakh-vaccinated-in-a-single-day-mumbai-55000/articleshow/81865883.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Delhi||Delhi: Jailed gangster Jitender Gogi arrested under MCOCA||NEW DELHI: Jailed gangster Jitender Gogi, who has recently been found operating freely from behind the bars, was arrested on Thursday under Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) by Delhi Police’s Special Cell. Gogi’s right-hand man, Kuldeep Maan alias Fajja, was recently gunned down after fleeing from GTB Hospital while being in custody, prompting reports that Gogi might also try to flee to run the gang. Of late, he had forged an alliance with Dubai-based gangster Sandeep alias Kala Jathedi. He also figured in an extortion bid of Rs 5 crore from a Dubai-based businessman. Under MCOCA, Gogi’s activities in jail can be reigned in more effectively and surveillance can be more stringent. Getting a bail will also be difficult. Gogi is being investigated by a team led by DCP Pramod Kushwaha, which is probing an FIR against the gangster filed in 2018 under MCOCA. He has been taken on remand for questioning. The MCOCA proposal details 19 cases of murder and attempted murder, besides dozens of extortions, dacoities, carjackings and robberies. Police have said Gogi, now 30, had started dealing in property after dropping out of school and taken to crime after his father’s death in 2010. “He fired at a man named Praveen in September 2010. Then, during elections at Shradhanand College, Delhi University, Gogi and his friends assaulted and shot at two men named Sandeep and Ravinder. Gogi was then arrested in October 2011. Thereafter, he... formed a gang to earn money,” the FIR stated. Gogi has been arrested in a number of cases with the same set of gang members, it added. In 2016, he was arrested by Panipat police but fled from custody while being taken to court later. In February 2017, he murdered one Devender Pradhan from Alipur as Pradhan’s son was involved in the murder of his associate, Niranjan. In October, Gogi killed popular Haryana folk singer Harshita Dahiya, a prime witness in a murder case lodged against his close associate, Dinesh Karala. He was caught last year. A teacher, Deepak, was murdered outside a corporation-run school in November and one Ravi Bhardwaj in Prashant Vihar this January by Gogi’s gang. The MCOCA FIR states all his earnings were spent in buying weapons and SUVs, which were used in committing more crimes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jailed-gangster-gogi-arrested-under-mcoca/articleshow/81861995.cms||Raj Shekhar

So far, five persons, including main accused Dabbu Singh, have been apprehended. A joint team of the police and excise department have launched a hunt for three others, including a local liquor mafia and sitting pradhan. According to the police, Dabbu was planning to contest the gram pradhan election from Katariya and had allegedly distributed spurious liquor to woo villagers on March 30. IG (Prayagraj range) K P Singh told TOI, “Two more people, identified as Rampal (50) and Rammilan Kori (35), residents of Ratiyapur and Katariya villages, have died during treatment The condition of three others is said to be stable.” He said, police have arrested five persons, including Dabbu, Kapil Singh, Babulal Kori, Ashok Kori and Ghamandu Singh, all natives of Raki village, in connection with the tragedy. Police have also decided to slap the stringent Gangster Act and National Security Act on the accused. The IG said, four people died at Katariya village, while one each in Poore Girja Ahar Beehar and Ratiyapur villages. The sudden deaths in the region has caught the local administration off guard and senior police officials, including ADG (Prayagraj zone) rushed to ground zero in Katria village on Wednesday morning to take stock of the situation. Three policemen, including an SHO, a sub-inspector and a constable, have been suspended for dereliction of duty. The IG has also written to SP (Pratapgarh) Akash Tomar to conduct the deceased’s viscera test to find out the exact cause of death. Viscera of all the six persons had been preserved after the post-mortem examination. He has also asked the SP to conduct viscera test of the four persons, who died after consuming spurious liquor in Sangramgarh village on March 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/pratapgarh-hooch-tragedy-toll-reaches-six-2-more-die/articleshow/81854306.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Trade bodies write to CM against lockdown in Mumbai||After seeing encouraging signs of recovery, cinema, mall, retail and restaurant bodies are worried over renewed lockdowns in the state to contain Covid-19. Various bodies have written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray saying that while the night curfew has reduced footfalls and business by almost 60%, a lockdown will sound the death knell for already struggling industries and cause job losses and permanent closures. The Multiplex Association of India (MAI), in its letter to the chief minister, expressed concern over messages on social media of an impending lockdown. It said a lockdown would affect the cinema, retail and shopping industry. Devang Sampat, director, MAI, and CEO, Cinepolis India, said it took almost nine months for multiplex owners to persuade content producers, mall owners and government to restart cinemas. Finally, when they saw consumer sentiment building, reports of night curfew and lockdown impacted the sector, which employs over two lakh people directly. Sampat said that in the past few months of reopening and operations, no cases were detected inside any multiplex as these had strict protocols in place. Rajneesh Mahajan of the Shopping Centres Association of India (SCAI) and CEO of Inorbit Malls said it would be unfair to ask malls, which were following the strictest protocols, to close while allowing other public places to remain open. He said the way to contain the coronavirus was to follow proven measures such as wearing a mask, hand hygiene and social distancing rather than to shut spaces. He said malls were seeing a week-on-week dip in footfalls due to abrupt closures and random and forced Covid-19 tests, and for which consumers at malls were made to pay while these were free at other public places. Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO, Retail Association of India (RAI), said that unlike last year, this year there was knowledge on how to stay safe without shutting the economy. He said most retail spaces saw almost 25% of their business between 7pm and 10pm. The NRAI, a restaurant association, wrote to the government and sought waiver, or at least deferment, of licence fee, excise fee, property tax and such to offer establishments a chance at survival. Restaurateur Anurag Katriar, who heads the NRAI, said 75% of the restaurant business was during dinner hours. By being asked to close by 8 pm, restaurants have very little chance of survival without support from the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/trade-bodies-write-to-cm-against-lockdown-in-mumbai/articleshow/81862003.cms||Amin Ali
---||Kanpur||City all set to celebrate second Holi on Ganga Mela today||Kanpur: After Holi revelry, the city is now all set to celebrate its annual cultural festival, Ganga Mela on the banks of river Ganga on Friday. The festival has been an annual tradition of the city from past 79 years. People play with colours in morning and then assemble at Sarsaiya Ghat in the evening on this day. Various social organizations, community cultural organizations, and others raise their stalls in area from Chetna crossing to Sarsaiya Ghat. Mela festivities start at around 4pm. Leaders of all political parties, MP, MLAs, district officials and others meet and greet each other. The festivity ends at around 6.30pm. All government and private offices and markets of the city remain closed on the occasion. According to Mool Chandra Seth of Hatia, the patron of Ganga Mela, the citizens had observed freedom by playing Holi with colours years before the India gained independence. In 1942, the then British collector had banned the use of colour during the Holi festival. A group of youths had then decided to boycott that order and celebrated the festival of colours at Hatia Park. The police had arrested 43 persons in that connection. To lodge their protest citizens had closed their shops and markets following which arrested persons were released. The city celebrated this victory with colours on the day. Since then the day is celebrated every year in Kanpur as per the occurrence of Anuradha Nakshatra, he added. Residents of Hatia take out a buffalo cart carrying drums of water colour and and pass through all major localities of the city every year. Kanpurites observe Holi twice with second celebration on Ganga Mela. Moolchand Seth said that like previous years this year too a buffalo cart will be taken out from Hatia park and will be carried out through Nayaganj, Generalganj, Kahu Kothi Birhana road and return to its starting point. Gyanendra Bishnoi convener said that the mela is an example of the brotherhood of all communities. Members of all the communities participate and celebrate. “Like previous years the buffalo Caravan will play patriotic songs and throw coloured water to passers by and residents of Birhana road and other areas will throw coloured water from their roofs on caravan.” Irfan Hashmi, one of the members of the committee, said that he and his community persons have decided to shower floral petals and offer gujiya to everyone. President of firecrackers association Raju Shamsi said that his association will display a firework as per the custom.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/city-all-set-to-celebrate-second-holi-on-ganga-mela-today/articleshow/81863559.cms||Anant Shekher Misra
---||Varanasi||UP min terms Mukhtar an ‘Islamic terrorist’||Revised Varanasi: After targeting mosques on the issue of ‘azaan’ through loudspeakers, UP minister Anand Swarup Shukla has now termed jailed mafia don and MLA Mukhtar Ansari as an ‘Islamic terrorist.’ Moreover, others like jailed BSP MLA Atul Rai have their own worries regarding government efforts for bringing Mukhtar to UP. Talking to reporters in Ballia on Thursday, Shukla hit the Congress for allegedly shielding Mukhtar. “It is in the DNA of Congress to patronise Islamic terror and anti-social elements. Mukhtar is also like an Islamic terrorist, hence Congress is standing with it,” alleged Shukla adding, “But Mukhtar won’t enjoy the comfort of the jail of Congress-ruled Punjab for long.” He said, “Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has prepared the ground to drag him out of the Punjab jail in order to bring him to UP for producing him before court and ensure punishment for him in the cases pending against him.” Earlier, BSP MP from Ghosi Atul Rai, who is lodged in Naini jail of Prayagraj district, on Wednesday requested the CM to avoid bringing Mukhtar to Naini jail, citing threat to his life. In a letter written to the CM, the BSP MP explained how his enmity increased with Mukhtar since 2019 Lok Sabha election after his party decided to field him instead of Mukhtar’s son Abbas Ansari from Ghosi seat. He alleged that Mukhtar’s close aide Angad Rai got him framed up in a fake rape case using some of Mukhtar’s pawns, including a member identified as Satyam Prakash Rai. He further stated that the call detail records of Angad Rai’s phone, who is cooling heels in Markundi jail in Sonbhadra district, showed that Angad had made several calls at the diktat of his mentor Mukhtar. Rai said he was lodged in Naini jail and a decision to put Mukhtar in the same jail would help the mafia to chalk out a plan to eliminate him (Rai). He said, “If Mukhtar will be lodged in Naini jail he will also have to revive his shattered network of criminals in the eastern UP region. The two-page letter has also gone viral on social media.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/up-min-terms-mukhtar-an-islamic-terrorist/articleshow/81863481.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Chennai||Rajinikanth: Thalaiva who ruled hearts of PM, people wins Dadasaheb Phalke||CHENNAI: No sooner had the announcement come on Thursday that ‘superstar’ Rajinikanth has been conferred the Dadasaheb Phalke award, congratulations poured in from across the political spectrum, some commenting that the recognition has come a bit late to the actor. Union minister of information and broadcasting Prakash Javadekar tweeted: “Happy to announce #Dadasaheb Phalke award for 2019 to one of the greatest actors in history of Indian cinema Rajinikant ji. His contribution as actor, producer and screenwriter has been iconic.” Starting off as an anti-hero, Rajinikanth, through almost half-a-century-long body of work that includes such mega hits as ‘Annamalai’, ‘Baasha’ and ‘Padayappa,’ built an image whose mass appeal is unparalleled in the annals of Indian cinema. It was in 1975 that Rajinikanth debuted in Tamil film ‘Apoorva Raagangal’, directed by his mentor K Balachandar who incidentally was conferred the award in 2010. Sivaji Ganesan in 1996 was the first from the Tamil film industry to bag it. While thanking members of the jury including singer Asha Bhosle, director-producer Subash Ghai and actor Mohan Lal, Javadekar denied the announcement had anything to do with the Tamil Nadu assembly poll. No political party in the state questioned the timing, apparently not wanting to offend the millions of Rajinikanth fans who were expecting him to take the political plunge until a couple of months ago. Everyone seemed only keen on offering bouquets. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was one of the first to congratulate ‘thalaiva’ (leader), as the actor’s fans fondly call him. “Popular across generations, a body of work few can boast of, diverse roles and an endearing personality…that’s Shri @Rajinikanth Ji for you. It is a matter of immense joy that Thalaiva has been conferred with the Dadasaheb Phalke Award. Congratulations to him,” he tweeted. Vice-president M Venkaiah Naidu said, “Over the past many years, the versatile actor has been enthralling people by portraying a vast array of roles depicting myriad hues of human experience and emotions.” Saying he had congratuled the actor over phone, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami said, “This is a recognition for your hard work and acting talent in the film industry.” DMK president M K Stalin, thrilled for his long-time friend, in a social media post said, “This award should have been conferred on him long time ago. It has been awarded to him belatedly.” Actor and MNM president Kamal Haasan tweeted in Tamil: “The award suits 100% to Rajinikanth, who has proved that just by appearing on the silver screen one can win over the fans.” AMMK general secretary T T V Dhinakaran and PMK youth wing president Anbumani Ramadoss also congratulated the star who remains popular despite nearing 70.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/thalaiva-who-ruled-hearts-of-pm-people-wins-dadasaheb-phalke/articleshow/81861978.cms||D Govardan
---||Meerut||Day 1 of Delhi-Meerut Expressway: Wrong-side driving, two-wheelers take fun out||MEERUT: The Delhi-Meerut Expressway, which opened to the public on Thursday, witnessed a mixed response from the commuters. While many of them uploaded videos of their first drive on social media, others complained that their journey took around 70 minutes, more than the promised 45 minutes. Wrong-side driving was a common peeve among commuters. The first day was also marred by an accident between a tempo and a pick-up van where both drivers suffered injuries. “It took me 70 minutes to reach Ashram in Delhi from Partapur in Meerut, which otherwise takes an hour and 40 minutes. It was an amazing drive and experience,” said Akash Jain who travelled from Meerut to Delhi on Thursday. Another commuter Rahul Sharma said, “The drive took me an hour and 10 minutes from Meerut to Noida, which otherwise takes no less than 2 hours. The travel time has reduced drastically and there was hardly any congestion.” Police said that the accident took place because many people were driving on the wrong side. Soon after the accident, police cleared the area and ensured that the traffic moved as usual. Many other commuters complained of the wrong-side driving too. Tarun Vashishth, a professor in Meerut, said, “Since the work on the expressway is still on at several places, traffic was moving on the wrong side which can lead to accidents.” Another local who travelled on the route, said, “Wrong-side driving is a serious issue. Also even though two-wheelers are prohibited on the expressway, they are seen throughout.” The construction work of Delhi-Meerut Expressway has been completed at a total cost of Rs 8,346 crore. Work on the total of 82 km long route has been completed under the project, of which the total length of the expressway is 60 km and the length of the national highway is 22 km. A total of 24 small and large bridges and 10 flyovers have been constructed under the project. Adequate arrangements have been made to light up the expressway - more than 4,500 lamps have been installed. Cameras have also been placed for security purposes. There are several gateways on the route while travelling from Delhi - Sarai Kale Khan, Akshardham Temple, Indirapuram, Dasna, Bhojpur and Meerut.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/day-1-of-dme-wrong-side-driving-presence-of-two-wheelers-take-fun-out-of-smooth-drive/articleshow/81855835.cms||Ishita Bhatia

The 104.485 kms long stretch dotting Kanpur-Unnao-Lucknow districts will be widened, and the road has been numbered as SH-173. Similarly, Lucknow -Kursi-Mahmoodabad road covering a stretch of 54.19 km dotting Lucknow-Barabanki and Sitapur would be converted into a state highway and has been numbered as SH-172. According to a proposal moved by the PWD, the conversion would be done soon. Principal secretary, PWD, Nitin Ramesh Gokarn said that a stretch of 104.485 km criss-crossing three districts — Kanpur, Unnao and Lucknow — and 54.19 km of stretch dotting Lucknow -Barabanki and Sitapur would be converted into a state highway and widened to ease traffic. The decision, PWD sources said, was taken after a high-level meeting convened recently to review the status of district roads and how they should be upgraded. “Keeping in view the requirements to enhance road safety, reduce congestion, improve road connectivity, the government has taken a decision to augment the existing stretches,” said Gokarn further. “The 104.485 km of stretch would also act as an alternate route also for the other vehicles coming from other nearby districts,” said divisional commissioner Raj Shekhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/2-roads-to-be-converted-into-state-highways/articleshow/81863621.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

A government spokesperson said on Thursday the land along the Yamuna that is illegally occupied by some Rohingyas will be cleared of encroachment this time. “The encroachment of our state’s land had been going on for years. The names of a Delhi MLA and some government officials have come to light in this for colluding with squatters and allowing the encroachment to take place. The Chief Minister has directed the irrigation department to take immediate and strict action against the accused and to free the encroached land,” he said. The irrigation department of UP has 1,007 hectare land in Okhla, Jasola, Madanpur Khadar, Aali, Saidabad, Jaitpur, Molarband and Khajuri Khas in New Delhi. Out of this, 20.9077 hectare had been encroached upon, the government spokesperson added. Last week, the state government got six acre land in Sarita Vihar area of New Delhi vacated from encroachers by sending its team along with Delhi Police and local administration. The BJP government also slammed the previous SP and BSP governments for not caring about the state’s precious land and letting the encroachment to continue. They did nothing to evict the encroachers and take back possession of the land, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-govt-to-evict-rohingyas-occupying-its-land-in-delhi/articleshow/81864056.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||India||FCI helps Punjab stave off crisis by lifting wheat stock||NEW DELHI: The Food Corporation of India (FCI) under the central government has helped the Punjab government tide over a crisis which would have hit wheat procurement scheduled to start from April 10, by lifting 22.42 million tonnes of the foodgrain held with the state agencies since 2018-19. Failure to clear the stock would have come in the way of the Punjab government to take advance loans from banks to pay the MSP to farmers for the fresh procurment. In Punjab, farmers sell their foodgrains to five state procuring agencies (SPAs) and they pay the money to farmers. Later this amount is reimbursed by FCI. To pay the amount to farmers immediately, these state agencies take advance loan from an SBI-led consortium of banks. As per rules, this Food Credit advance has to be repaid within three years. But the Punjab government could not pay the loan of Rs 89,000 crore from 2018-19 as the stock was still to be lifted. Punjab avails Cash Credit Limit (CCL) from a consortium of banks which is known as Food Credit Consortium, led by SBI. The CCL is sanctioned for each season separately, depending upon the funds required for estimated procurement quantity. The Centre gives consent for such loan to the state government. These CCLs are secured by the food grains stocks held by the state procuring agencies. FCI makes payments to SPAs after the foodgrains are lifted by it. Due to non-repayment of advances taken by SPAs, the Punjab government was facing the problem of their loan becoming NPA on March 31 (Wednesday). “As the RBI had declined to further extend the deadline, the outstanding was going to become NPA. If this had happened, the state agencies would not have been able to take any further advance from banks to pay upfront to farmers. This could have led to a disastrous situation,” said a source. In a letter addressed to Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, Food Minister Piyush Goyal had mentioned that the state government had in February urged the food ministry and FCI to evacuate 22.42 million tonnes of wheat stock held by the state agencies. Goyal had assured that the total stock would be evacuated to avoid any crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/fci-helps-punjab-stave-off-crisis-by-lifting-wheat-stock/articleshow/81865493.cms||Dipak K Dash

While Arukutty had brought the party victory in the past two consecutive outings from the seat, the narrow win last time seemed to have cast doubt on the party about his ability to pull off another victory. The DMK has, meanwhile, put its full faith on Payya Gounder alias R Krishnan, who had given the AIADMK a close fight in the previous election. The party seems to think that if he could dent the ruling party’s vote share by a huge margin in the very first outing, he could pull off a sure victory in the second (outing).Given the current circumstances, the alliance with the BJP is likely to do a lot of good to the AIADMK, since the saffron party had improved its vote share in 2016 to 22,444 from just 6,175 in 2011. Every single vote would be valuable for both the Dravidian outfits this time, as they gear up for the big fight.It was only in 2011 that Kavundampalayam was segregated from Thondamuthur constituency and made a separate assembly segment. And this is just the third battle for the segment. Will the AIADMK be third time lucky is the question doing rounds now. The DMK can’t take Arunkumar lightly. He had proved his mettle in the 2016 election by winning from Coimbatore North assembly constituency. His stint as Periyanaickenpalayam town panchayat chairman from 1996-2016 had made him popular among the people there. He belongs to Naidu community, which has a major presence in the segment.While the DMK candidate also belongs to one of the dominant communities - gounder – in the constituency, the deciding factor would be the votes from city corporation areas. A real estate player, Payya Gounder alias R Krishnan was also Kalapatti town panchayat president for almost 10 years from 2006 to 2016 and wields a considerable influence in the locality.The AIADMK is dominant in areas such as Periyanaickenpalayam, Idikarai, Narasimmanaickenpalayam, Kurumbapalayam, Ashokapuram, Somayampalayam, Kavundampalayam and Thadagam, while the DMK has huge support base at Kalapatti, Saravanampatti, Vilankurichi and Kovilpalayam areas. Earlier, the ruling party was strong in Kondayampalayam village, where the DMK has now penetrated to a large extent.M Senthilkumar, a private company staff, said, “We cannot predict the winner. Both the candidates are popular. A portion of city corporation falls in the constituency and the voters there will play a crucial role.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/aiadmk-pulls-out-all-stops-to-rout-dmk-in-kavundampalayam/articleshow/81858945.cms||A Subburaj

As soon as it was known that an ambulance with UP registration number (UP41 AT 7171) had ferried Mukhtar from Ropar jail to Mohali court, it was tracked and was found registered in the name of a Mau-based private hospital, being run by the brother of Dr Alka Rai, who is posted in a government hospital and is also general secretary of BJP’s Gorakhpur regional unit women wing. When reporters contacted Dr Alka Rai on Thursday to confirm the findings, she revealed Mukhtar had taken signatures of her brother on some papers for buying an ambulance from MLA fund for public use about a decade ago. “Sometime after 2009, Mukhtar had sent a message saying he wanted to buy an ambulance for public use from his MLA fund and since it could be in the name of a hospital only, had sought cooperation. Since he was the local MLA, my brother signed some documents as director of Shyam Sanjivani hospital. We were not informed whether any ambulance was purchased on those documents or not,” Dr Rai said. My brother’s hospital is in Mau and has no branch in Barabanki where this ambulance was registered with the regional transport office, she added. Meanwhile, Krishnanand Rai’s widow and BJP MLA Alka Rai also questioned how the ambulance with UP number reached Punjab and demanded thorough investigation. “I have requested the chief minister and chief secretary to order a probe in the matter as the owners of the hospital in Mau have refused even having any knowledge about the ambulance,” said Rai, who sent four letters to Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra complaining about the Congress government in Punjab shielding the don. When TOI contacted SP Mau Sushil Ghule, he said no probe has been started by the district police yet as no complaint has been given by anyone so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/mukhtar-row-gets-murkier-mauhosp-ignorant-about-ambulance/articleshow/81863466.cms||---

He also informed that currently there are 95 laboratories doing corona testing in the state. Speaking during a debate on issuing bogus corona reports in Surat, Patel said there were allegations that the two laboratories, Tejas Laboratory and Hemjyot Laboratories, were involved in issuing such reports. An inquiry was constituted and it was established that there was no irregularity, he said. “We got the reports and even the payment receipts of the patients, and on verification, the high-powered committee gave clean chit to the two laboratories.” He added that the Surat Municipal Corporation had given 25 kits to Tejas Laboratory, of which only nine were used and 16 were found unused. In the case of other laboratory, 150 kits were issued and only three were unused. Patel said that initially all corona samples used to be sent to National Institute of Virology and then the testing facility was set up at BJ Medical College and now 45 government laboratories and 50 other private laboratories are involved in testing for corona.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dycm-gives-clean-chit-to-surat-labs/articleshow/81862064.cms||---

More than seven patients died during treatment at the hsopitals which were managed directed by the Gujarat government. The state government revealed this in response to a question assked by Dhandhuka MLA Rajeskumar Gohil. The government stated that cases began to increase in April and were at its peak in May, when Civil Hospital alone treated 4,532 patients and another 3,188 patients in June. Thereafter, there was a decline in patients coming for treatment. However, once again the number of patients admitted to Civil rose in November, when 3,726 patients were admitted. Of the 20,273 patients treated, 56.5% patients were given treatment in May, June and November months. A senior health officer said, “During November, the relaxation given to shops and establishment due to Diwali festival followed by celebrations for Diwali and New Year led to a major spike in November. The number of patients treated in October was 1,290 which jumped to 3,726 in November — an increase of 200%.” The reply in the state assembly also revealed that 1,764 corona patients died during treatment. “Of the 1,764 deaths, maximum of 956 patients died at Civil hospital, followed by 469 deaths at Institute of Kidney Diseases and Research Institute, and 245 deaths at UN Mehta Institute of Cardiology.

---||Goa||Cause for worry as over 100 Covid cases at South Goa district hospital||MARGAO: For the first time in five months, the South Goa district hospital’s occupancy for Covid-19 patients crossed 100 on Wednesday. It now has 60 per cent of its beds filled. The last time the hospital had over 100 active cases was in mid-October last year. The spike in coronavirus cases has led to a significant rise in hospitalisation over the past month. On some days, the hospital is seeing over 20 admissions. With over 100 patients admitted over the past week alone, the hospital is witnessing a three-fold increase in admissions compared to February. More men than women are being admitted. The active cases also include pregnant women and children. The hospital that treats mild to severe cases of Covid-19 presently has five serious patients in its nine-bedded ICU. The critical cases are sent to GMC. Only 170 beds in the new hospital have been commissioned for Covid-19 patients with around 76 beds for males, 58 for females, 21 for obstetrics and gynaecology, and six for paediatric patients. Health minister Vishwajit Rane, while recently replying to Nuvem MLA Wilfred D’Sa’s question in the legislative assembly on utilising the fourth and fifth floors of the district hospital, had said that “the matter of establishing a private medical college in line with PPP guidelines from NITI Aayog is under deliberation”. GMC dean Dr S Bandekar, who is also in charge of Covid hospitals, recently told mediapersons that the government is prepared for a second wave and that more beds can be commissioned at the South Goa district hospital. “Right now, we are using only one-tenth the bed capacity, so we can increase this ten times. The hospital has a capacity of 500 beds,” he had said. The ESI hospital, which treated the first wave of Covid-19 patients last year, continues to be notified as a Covid hospital, but doesn’t have any Covid-19 patients admitted. It has also not been treating regular ESI patients. The hospital was identified as an isolation centre for returnees from the UK who could be carrying the other strains of Covid-19. The last UK returnee was discharged after 14 days of isolation and after testing negative for RTPCR, in February.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cause-for-worry-as-over-100-covid-cases-at-south-goa-district-hospital/articleshow/81862143.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Thursday saw a 23% rise in new infections, while the case positivity rate rose to 10%. The mortality count rose to 832 with a death of a 46-year-old male from Taleigao who had multiple comorbidities, including liver cirrhosis. The day saw 24 patients getting hospitalised and 58 home-isolated, with the number of people needing hospitalisation having doubled over the past few days. In the last few days, from among those who travelled into Goa 10 people tested positive, with two cases detected on Thursday. The individual tally of Panaji and Margao is inching closer to 200 and have the highest caseload as compared to other centres. An official from the health department said they are expecting a further rise in infections in Panaji and Margao, and they would likely breach the 200-mark in the next two to three days. The caseload of centres at Vasco, Ponda, Porvorim, and Candolim has been over 100, and on Thursday the combined tally was 531. “When Goa saw Covid-19 infections rising in June 2020 and an outbreak was reported at Mangor Hill, Vasco, it was soon declared a containment zone, but within a few days more cases were detected in other parts of the port town,” a health official said. However, in second phase of the pandemic, he said the rise in infections has been in Panaji and Margao. The official said the situation could worsen in Ponda, Porvorim, Vasco and Candolim, where the numbers are growing at an alarming rate. “Unless people strictly adhere to the mandatory Covid SOPs, places that are more populated and having more commercial activities will see a spike in infections in the days to come,” he said. The health official also said that Chimbel, Siolim, Aldona, Sankhali and Mapusa need to be watched closely as a slow but steady rise is being witnessed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-265-new-cases-positivity-rate-10-in-goa/articleshow/81863186.cms||---

---||Goa||After cutting water supply, MVR Infra snaps power lines to Bardez||PANAJI: Barely a week after damaging an underground pipeline depriving water supply to parts of Bardez, the contractor for the ongoing highway expansion work in North Goa—M Venkat Rao Infra Projects Pvt Ltd—on Thursday punctured two 33KV underground power cables leaving most of Bardez taluka without electricity. The power supply that went off at around 12.30pm on Thursday was not restored in most parts till late in the night. The electricity department officials said they have lost count of the number of times MVR Infra Projects has punctured the cables and several letters from them to the contractor have been in vain. The electricity department officials said the underground cables running from Tivim substation were punctured half an hour apart leading to the blackout in Bardez taluka. Museum of Goa (MOG) director and artist Subodh Kerkar told TOI that he was forced to run the museum at Pilerne on a generator for the entire day and even when he returned home to Saligao at night, he had to make do with candles. “The contractor needs to be penalised instead of taking things so casually. There is nil coordination between the PWD, WRD and the electricity departments. If the government cannot handle simple and basic issues like electricity, the minister should resign. Instead of empowering themselves by buying MLAs, they should start acting like leaders and working in the interest of people. As a citizen, I protest,” Kerkar said. The electricity department engineers said despite sending several letters to the contractor, more underground cables continue to be punctured during road work reducing the life of the cables and causing loss to the exchequer. They said the PWD must act against the contractor for repeatedly damaging the power cables. “But the contractor is influential,” one of the officials said. On its part, the PWD said it has issued a showcause notice to MVR Infra Projects. “A showcause notice was immediately issued on Thursday. For earlier instances, where water supply pipeline was damaged, showcause notices have been issued,” principal chief engineer Uttam Parsekar told TOI. In the past five months, the highway expansion work by MVR Infra Projects has seen water supply to Bardez taluka getting affected on at least three occasions due to damage to the pipeline. “The contractor has been told that they have to take up the repairs immediately as these are basic utilities and complete the repairs in the shortest possible time. These conditions are part of the contract. The underground cables have already been repaired,” Parsekar said on Thursday evening, while most of the taluka was in darkness. When TOI contacted MVR Infra Projects managing director M R K Prasad Rao, he said: “Please call me tomorrow.” A resident of Pilerne waited for seven hours in the hope that power would be restored and at 7:30pm was forced to go to Panaji and work from his office premises. “The power went out at around 12:30 in the afternoon and didn’t come back at all until 8pm but was out again after an hour. There should be a ring system to divert the power in such cases,” he said. Kerkar said to keep the museum running on a generator was very expensive. “But we had to do it in the service of art. The tickets don’t cover the cost of the generator and the visitors too were inconvenienced,” he said. PWD officials said there are no blueprints available with the department indicating the location of the underground cables or the water supply pipelines. The water pipelines were laid almost four decades ago, but the underground cabling work was carried out recently. “For all new works, maps are being maintained to indicate the location of the utilities. In fact, when new roadwork is taken up, alternative lines for underground power cables and water pipelines are being provided, so that there is a back-up available in case the main lines suffer major damage,” said Parsekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-cutting-water-supply-mvr-infra-snaps-power-lines-to-bardez/articleshow/81862843.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Corruption case complainant who turned hostile gets 2 mnths in jail||Mumbai: In a first case of its kind, a special court under the Prevention of Corruption Act on Monday sentenced a Bhusawal resident to two months of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 500 for turning hostile and giving false evidence in court in a corruption case. Vishal Pandit Sonawane had approached the Bodhwad Maha e-Sewa Centre to get an Aadhar card for himself. His allegation was that operators at the centre, Nilesh Deshmukh and Chandrakant Mahajan, demanded Rs 160 bribe to issue on-the-spot Aadhar card. Sonawane lodged a complaint against the duo with the anti-corruption bureau (ACB). Acting on the complaint, the ACB trapped Deshmukh and Mahajan while accepting the bribe amount. When the case came up for hearing before the Bhusawal sessions court, Sonawane turned hostile and gave false evidence before the court, stating he had no complaint. Following Sonawane’s statement, the ACB court acquitted the two accused. The ACB then moved court seeking criminal proceedings against Sonawane under section 344 of the Criminal Procedure Court for submitting false evidence before the court. Section 344 of CRPC provides for summary procedure for trial for giving false evidence. CRPC provides that if any witness has deliberately or knowingly given false or fabricated evidence, with the intention that such evidence will be used in the case, then the court has powers to try the case summarily and sentence the accused to imprisonment for a term that may extend to three months or fine up to Rs 500 or both. Taking cognizance of the submissions made by the ACB, additional sessions judge S B Bhansali sentenced Sonawane and imposed a fine too.“Further, we are in the process of challenging the acquittal of Deshmukh and Mahajan since they were acquitted on the basis of false evidence,” a senior ACB official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-corruption-case-complainant-who-turned-hostile-gets-2-mnths-in-jail/articleshow/81862114.cms||---

---||Lucknow||‘Punjab govt allowed Mukhtar Ansari to use personal ambulance to go to court: UP min||Lucknow / Chandigarh/ Varanasi : The mystery over the ambulance with a UP registration that was used to ferry jailed gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari from Ropar jail to Mohali court in Punjab turned murkier on Thursday after cabinet minister and government spokesperson Siddharth Nath Singh said the ambulance is bullet-proof and owned by Mukhtar Ansari himself and questioned the role of Punjab government in the entire issue. “A thorough probe will be conducted to find out how an ambulance is being used as a private vehicle by Mukhtar Ansari. It is a bullet-proof luxury vehicle,” he said. “It is now for the Punjab government to explain how a jail inmate was allowed to use a private vehicle to reach Mohali court for a hearing and brought back to Ropar jail. It is more than evident that the Congress government in Punjab is providing patronage to the gangster and Twitter rani Priyanka Gandhi should now explain this at least on twitter,” Singh said. Singh said the registration papers of the ambulance show that vehicle was purchased in 2013 on documents found to be containing incorrect information. “How did the government at that time allow it? At that time gangsters like Mukhtar were a part of the government,” he said adding that all aspects of the ambulance will be probed thoroughly and the guilty will be punished. The Punjab prisons department has clarified that the ambulance used to transport Ansari from Ropar jail to Mohali court on Wednesday is owned by him but it is not a bullet-proof ambulance and Punjab prisons rules allow use of private conveyance. Praveen Kumar Sinha, ADGP (prisons) Punjab, told TOI, “This ambulance was provided by Mukhtar Ansari. But, it is not a bullet proof ambulance but a regular one.” “Jails department hands over a prisoner to the police party which takes the prisoner to the court as per the Punjab Prisoners (Attendance in Courts) Rules. There is a provision in these rules that the police party can allow a separate conveyance if a prisoner wants,” said Sinha. On the other hand, BJP MLA Alka Rai who is widow of former BJP MLA Krishnanand Rai, has shot a letter to Additional Chief secretary (home) demanding a probe into the gangster Mukhtar Ansari being ferried in an ambulance which had a UP registration. Investigations so far have revealed that Mukhtar had travelled from Ropar Jail to Mohali court in an ambulance which has a UP registration (UP 41 AT 7171). The vehicle was registered with the Barabanki ARTO. However, vehicle records reveal that it was purchased by Shyam Sanjeevni Hospital in Mau in 2013. A co-owner of the hospital Dr Alka Rai, who claims to be the general secretary of BJP Mahila wing (Gorakhpur region) confirmed that papers were signed on behalf of the hospital for purchase of the vehicle in 2013. “Sometime around 2013 Mukhtar Ansari (who was then a local MLA) had sent a message to us saying that he wanted to gift an ambulance to help the poor at times of medical needs. As the ambulance could be purchased only by a hospital, he asked for help. Thereafter my brother as director of Shyam Sanjivani hospital signed some documents so that the ambulance could be purchased. I don’t know what happened after that and need sometime to find out the details,” she said on Thursday. She said Shyam Sanjivani Hospital has no connection with Barabanki whatsoever and was unaware how the ambulance got registered with ARTO Barabanki. Meanwhile, former UP DGP Brij Lal said the ambulance in question is actually a mobile den of the gangster which he has been using for the past more than 7 years. “Apart from satellite phones, the ambulance has weapons. The driver of this ambulance Salim is a close associate of Mukhtar hailing from Mohammadabad,” Brij Lal said. He said whenever Mukhtar moves in the ambulance his henchmen and personal bodyguards also accompany him in a fleet of SUVs. Sources at Barabanki ARTO office revealed the department has not been able to find any records related to the ambulance till Thursday evening. Punjab ADGP (prison) further said there was also a precedent as various courts in Uttar Pradesh had earlier allowed Ansari to use a separate private conveyance. “Everyone knows Ansari’s medical condition and there are medical reports from the PGIMER, Chandigarh, about his health condition,” he said, adding that the Punjab prisons rules provide for the option of private conveyance in such an eventuality. Asked when the Ropar central jail is likely to hand over Ansari to the Uttar Pradesh government in compliance with the Supreme Court orders, Sinha said that the legal evaluation process is in progress. “How to implement the court’s order is the question and we are looking for legal guidance on that account,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/punjab-govt-allowed-mukhtar-ansari-to-use-personal-ambulance-to-go-to-court-up-min/articleshow/81864072.cms||Sanjeev Verma

---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad experts call for waste collection guidelines||Aurangabad: No specific guidelines are in place within Aurangabad for collection of waste — including biomedical waste — from Covid patients under home isolation. Given the 4,815 patients are under home isolation, accounting for more than half of all active cases in Aurangabad, activists are pressing for clear guidelines as they fear the infection may spread rapidly if there are no checks on safe disposal of waste. “We know a few patients in our locality who are home isolating. We have noticed that their family members hand over all the waste to the waste collector who brings a vehicle for door-to-door garbage collection. We all feel vulnerable as the waste from the home-isolated patients is not separated,” said Asha Beedkar, a resident of sector N-11. As per the official data, around 2,154kg biomedical waste has been generated within the Auranagbad municipal limits since the Covid outbreak more than a year ago. Civic activist Rajendra Datey Patil said that last year, cities like Noida had declared separate rules for garbage collection from home-isolated patients. The garbage from such households was to be collected only in exclusive yellow bags. “While Aurangabad did not have any similar measure last year, it is now time to consider such an option because there are more takers for home isolation due to the skewed hospital bed-active patient ratio. The number of patients opting for home isolation is likely to increase,” he said. Moreover, only seven vehicles are now operating in Aurangabad to collect biomedical waste being generated by institutions offering healthcare to Covid patients. Patil said the number of such vehicles must be increased as more private hospitals and state-run health institutions are being roped in to trat Covid cases. Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) health officer Neeta Padalkar, who had recently tested positive for Covid-19, could not be reached for her comments. Nandkishore Bhombe, the incharge of AMC’s solid waste management cell, did not respond to phone calls or SMSes. AMC administrator Astik Kumar Pandey was also unresponsive to such communications.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-experts-call-for-waste-collection-guidelines/articleshow/81853106.cms||---

The court said that the husband’s involvement in abetment to suicide and cruelty in marriage appears prima facie true, and the probe too is underway. Looking at the possible impact of this case on society, Gafurji cannot be released on bail. The court said that this incident of suicide was like a warning signal and a stigma “not only for a caste or a community, but for the entire society and humanity”. Aisha’s stress was visible from her utterance that the God may not give her next birth as a human being. “She is disgusted with the entire mankind because of the cruelty perpetrated on her,” the court said. Aisha’s suicide led to countrywide ramifications with the Muslim community leaders appealing to shun the practice of dowry and the All India Muslim Personal Law Board introducing the prohibitory clause in its Nikahnama format. While refusing bail to the husband, the court praised the woman for not abusing her husband even after being meted out with so much cruelty that led her to commit suicide. It said, “She did not abuse her husband before committing suicide but cursed her destiny. This reflects her one-sided love, loyalty, dedication towards her husband.” The court lauded the woman’s values and observed that even before committing suicide, she had obeyed the final command from her husband and made a video and sent it to him. After Aisha’s suicide, her husband was arrested from Pali town in Rajasthan on March 1. He is from Jhalore, but was on the run after hearing about his wife’s suicide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/court-refuses-bail-to-aishas-husband/articleshow/81862134.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: A past full of violence, future tense for Rohingya refugees||NEW DELHI: Next to the makeshift assembly hall in the low-lying area at Kanchan Kunj near the Yamuna in southeast Delhi, some toddlers play happily while elders with drawn faces huddle together. There is consternation at the Rohingya camp set up there after the shacks at another location were gutted in a fire on April 2018. Apparently a four-member family was detained by police on Wednesday morning, barely a week after a family of six had been similarly detained. Mohammad Salimullah, who came to Delhi after violence in his home district of Rakhine in Myanmar in 2013, claimed that arbitrary detentions had increased in the last one month. “Around March 24, a six-member family was detained from Shram Vihar camp, which houses a bigger refugee community,” said Salimullah. “While the authorities said these people didn’t have refugee documents, the fact is most residents here do have valid UNHCR documents though their renewal has become difficult due to the Covid pandemic.” The Rohingya refugee community in Delhi is caught between a rock and a hard place. The military takeover and the spiralling violence in Myanmar have made them extremely anxious about the safety of relatives back home and at the same time, they allege, the city authorities have been detaining an increasing number of Rohingyas in Delhi. There are around 900 registered Rohingya refugees in Delhi, mostly living in shacks fabricated out of cardboard, bamboo and old cloths in Shram Vihar and Kanchan Kunj camps along the Yamuna’s bank in southeast Delhi’s Madanpur Khadar. While Shram Vihar is home to around 100 families, the Kanchan Vihar camp has around 55 families engaged as labourers, domestic workers, vegetable sellers and ragpicker. “Most of the current violence in Myanmar is centred around Rangoon, but the Rohingya have been systematically targeted for over 70 years,” claimed Anwar Shah, who arrived in Delhi in 2010 with seven family members. “We are second-class citizens with restricted education opportunities and subjected to hostility.” He reiterated fears about the reality of the recent detentionsin India, claiming that 150 community people were recently rounded up in Jammu. “Give the families time to renew their refugee documents,” pleaded Salimullah, pointing out that most residents of Kanchan Vihar had lost their belongings in the massive blaze in the camp in 2018. Located next to the Kalindi Kunj sewage outlet on the Yamuna, the camp has toilets made with tin sheets and a Delhi Jal Board connection that supplies water twice a week. Cardboard dwellings and items recovered from trash are the only items the families own. At a micro shop selling basic necessities, a woman, warily requesting anonymity, expressed the fears of the refugees. “We have already lost everything. What is the point of harassing us all over again?” she mumbled. Sabber Kyaw Min, founder-director of Rohingya Human Rights Initiative, said that the Indian government should issue clear guidelines and engage with the refugees to build their confidence. “Detaining innocent people is not the solution to the problem. At least wait till a civilian government comes back to power in Myanmar,” Sabber Kyaw Min advised. “These days, even the sirens of ambulances now cause fear in camps with people angst-ridden about being the next to be picked up.” Claiming that 28 people had been detained in the past month, the Rohingya rights activist added that Covid cases were also rising and requested a stop to “terrorising of the victimised families when the Supreme Court is in the middle of hearing our case”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-past-full-of-violence-future-tense-for-rohingya-refugees/articleshow/81862126.cms||Paras Singh
---||Meerut||Daughters of doc couple held hostage by ward boy, sexually assaulted||MEERUT: After shutting down all points of entry, the ward boy of a nursing home held the two daughters of a doctor couple, 20 and 16, hostage at knife-point in their washroom and allegedly sexually assaulted them on Wednesday night. The couple lives on the second floor of the nursing home. At the time this happened, the girls’ father was on the terrace and mother on the first floor. The ward boy was a trusted help and would often run errands for the family. “He had worked for them for five years,” Sadar Dehat circle officer Poonam Sirohi said. He had been recently married and the couple would help out with his expenses. On Wednesday night, he told the girls he had to water the plants and entered the house. Once in, he bolted all doors. The girls’ parents were locked out. On him, he had two knives and Viagra. “He held my daughters hostage and threatened them with a knife,” the girls’ father said in his complaint to the police. The ward boy then forced them into the washroom and confined them there. “There, he began groping and molesting them.” Then, he made his demand. He wanted Rs 5 lakh, or he would rape them. “He made my daughters call their mother to ask for the money,” the complaint added. In that call, he said the parents should leave and video call from another location. With all of this going on, the commotion caught the neighbours’ attention. After the local police station was informed, cops arrived and had a tough decision before them — should they break in with an armed intruder in the house? Eventually, they took the call they would. About an hour since the ward boy had taken them hostage, police broke into the house, and overpowered and arrested him. He has been charged under sections of the Pocso Act and for attempt to rape, extortion and wrongful confinement. (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/daughters-of-doc-couple-held-hostage-by-ward-boy-sexually-assaulted/articleshow/81855961.cms||Piyush Rai
---||Coimbatore||Hindu Munnani, BJP members booked for creating tension||Coimbatore: The city police have registered a case against Hindu Munnani and BJP cadres, and some Muslims for creating tension during a bike rally conducted as part of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath's election campaign for BJP’s Coimbatore South candidate Vanathi Srinivasan on Wednesday. Ukkadam sub-inspector S Balachandar had lodged a complaint on Wednesday. “Around 1pm, 300 Hindu Munnani and BJP cadres, who conducted a bike rally, raised slogans such as ‘This is a Hindu country’, ‘The country is owned by Hindu people’, ‘Jai Kali’, ‘Om Kali’ and ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’. It angered a group of Muslims gathered near a footwear shop on Big Bazaar Street, who also raised slogans. Some BJP and Hindu Munnani cadres stopped their bikes and walked towards the Muslim people. Tension prevailed in the area and traffic was also affected. People from both sides used filthy language to abuse each other. Meanwhile, a person threw a stone at a shop,” the complaint said. The Ukkadam police registered a case against the troublemakers under sections 143 (unlawful assembly), 294 (b) (sings, recites or utters any obscene song, ballad or words in or near any public place), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 506 (i) of the Indian Penal Code. Police have collected video footage of the bike rally to identify the people. Meanwhile, Vanathi on Thursday said the stone pelting incident was a minor issue. “People should understand who blew up the issue. BJP is not attempting to create tension in Coimbatore. Serial bomb blasts happened in Coimbatore during the DMK regime,” she said. The Peelamedu police registered an FIR against BJP district president Nandakumar, Hindu Munnani state secretary Kishore, district president Dhasaradhan, Hindu Munnani functionaries Guna, Sathishkumar, Narayanana and others for conducting the rally, creating nuisance to the public and causing traffic jam. They failed to wear face mask and did not maintain social distancing, police said. They were booked under sections 143, 188, 269 and 341 of the Indian Penal Code and section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/hindu-munnani-bjp-members-booked-for-creating-tension/articleshow/81859121.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Of that, Rs 18.35 crore has been allocated to Yavatmal district alone. “The money will be spent to develop spots like Pohradevi, Tipeshwar, Mahalaxmi and Dhamangaon temples in the district,” said former forest minister Sanjay Rathod. Rathod said as forest minister he had appealed to the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to develop ecotourism spots in the state to boost local employment. The government has released Rs 9.43 crore for boosting tourism in and around Tipeshwar wildlife sanctuary. The famous Mahalaxmi temple at Deulgaon Walsa in Darwha tehsil will also be developed as a tourism spot by spending Rs 32 lakh. Rathod said Rs 24 lakh will be spent to develop Sant Mugsachi Maharaj memorial at Dhamangaon (Dev). Among other places to be developed include biodiversity park at Jamb, biological park at Pohradevi, and Aroma park at Ner. To boost ecotourism in other parts of the state, the state released Rs 2.76 crore for the conservation of chinkara and biodiversity park at Indapur in Pune. It also released Rs 4.18 crore for Taljai forest park at Pachgaon and Rs 3.49 crore for wildlife tourism at Kanheri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/yavatmal-gets-lions-share-of-state-ecotourism-funds/articleshow/81855954.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Health systems in dists may collapse, says Maharashtra government||MUMBAI: As Covid-19 cases continue to surge, Maharashtra, with as many as 310 active cases per million population, could face a breakdown of health systems like developed European countries experienced once their active cases crossed 110 per million, the state health department has warned the districts. Maharashtra added over 6.5 lakh cases in March, driving a four-fold jump in active cases in a month’s time. Asking them “to be alert”, state principal health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas sent a detailed list of control measures, especially quarantine and containment. A central team of experts has blamed the surge on the state’s inability to implement basic containment strategies and stopping contacts of patients from roaming around. The state circular on fresh norms to curb the Covid wave said every new positive case should be marked on a map, following which districts should immediately detect if there are clusters—more than five cases in urban and 15 cases in rural areas. A micro containment zone should be carved out with 25 or more households under surveillance with strict perimeter control. Districts have been asked to trace 20-30 contacts for every positive case within 48 hours and test them on the seventh day of exposure. They were especially told to update data regularly as the state’s contact tracing steps were being seen in poor light simply because the data was not updated though work was being done on the ground. State principal health secretary Pradeep Vyas wrote to districts on Wednesday that the action points on controlling the Covid wave were framed following online meetings with Dr V K Paul of Niti Aayog, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) head Dr Balram Bhargava, and National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) chief Dr Sujeet Singh last week. The districts have been asked to ensure that contacts of patients quarantine either at home or in an institution, but must not roam around. “Government of India has identified this as the main reason for the recent surge of cases in certain districts,” Vyas underlined. “At present, Maharashtra has roughly 310 active cases per million population, which is much more than the figure of 110 active cases per million when Italy and other advanced countries in Europe started facing crisis. So we need to be alert,” he wrote, asking districts to tremendously increase testing and contact-tracing. Stressing on a data-driven approach, the department has asked districts to update information on cases, severity, discharges in real time and maintain data transparency. Vyas said even if contact-tracing has been done, the data has not been entered in the portal. “As a result, a poor picture of Maharashtra is shown as if we are not doing an adequate number of contact-tracing,” he said. A senior district official from Nanded said monitoring of containment zones has been a challenge because of manpower. “There is little cooperation from people. Unlike last year, the element of fear is missing. Many simply go on with their routine lives like attending office or going out for shopping despite having a positive patient at home,” the official said, adding that they have had to involve local police at times. Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state Covid task force, said people cannot become casual about Covid precaution. “Even those who are vaccinated will have to stay home and follow treatment protocols if they test positive,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/health-systems-in-dists-may-collapse-says-state/articleshow/81865048.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Mumbai||Many civic centres run out of Covaxin; BMC assures stocks kept aside for second doses in Mumbai||Several civic centres ran out of Covaxin doses on Thursday and recipients keen on taking the Bharat Biotech vaccine were asked to come back later. Civic authorities said Covaxin stocks have been kept aside for those due for their second dose and there was enough stock of Covishield. The vaccine shortage, though, was more acute in the Vasai-Virar region. The Vasai-Virar Municipal Corporation had switched to alternate days of vaccination due to a shortage in doses. They had received 38,900 Covishield doses and 4,800 Covaxin doses despite requesting for one lakh additional doses. Civic officials said vaccination will be difficult from Friday, more so because people are queuing up for a second dose too. In Mumbai, four members from the Mehta family were turned away from Nesco vaccination centre. “We were told Covaxin stocks would arrive on Thursday, but it appears they didn’t,” said Ashish Mehta, adding that they were offered to take Covishield, but they have decided to wait. Dean of Nesco facility Dr Neelam Andrade said they have exhausted all Covaxin doses. The situation was similar in SevenHills Hospital. Dean Dr Balkrishna Adsul said they have the last few vials remaining. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said: “We have saved Covaxin doses for those who are due for their second shots.The state has told us that we should get the doses in 2-4 days.” —Sumitra Deb Roy & Sandhya Nair||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/many-civic-centres-run-out-of-covaxin-bmc-assures-stocks-kept-aside-for-second-doses-in-mumbai/articleshow/81864081.cms||---
---||Nashik||Maharashtra: Mob attacks police station in Dhule; one dead, six hurt||NASHIK: Two suspects arrested for allegedly molesting a girl escaped from police custody as a mob demanding their release threw stones at the Dondaicha police station in Sinkheda taluka of Dhule district late on Wednesday night. A man was killed and four policemen were injured in the attack and the group clash that followed. Two men also sustained injuries in police firing. Nashik range special IG, Pratap Dighavkar, told TOI that the police were forced to open two rounds of fire to disperse the mob of more than 100 people. The two suspects who escaped were still at large at the time of going to press. Police identified the man who died in the group clash as Shahbaz Shah Gulab Shah (49), of Dondaicha town. “The two suspects were brought to the police station after their arrest on Wednesday night. The girl’s family had registered a police complaint. Around 11.45pm, the mob backing the suspects gathered at the police station and demanded their immediate release,” said Dighavkar. The officer said the mob allegedly started throwing stones and other missiles at the police station, in which four policemen sustained injuries. “A police team immediately put the two suspects inside a van to take them for a medical examination, but the mob blocked the road. Sensing trouble, police fired two rounds in which two protesters were injured. Taking advantage of the commotion, the suspects escaped from the police van,” Dighavkar said. The officer said the two men injured in the police firing were taken to the rural hospital in the taluka and their condition was stable. Additional SP of Dhule, Prashant Bacchav, said a fresh clash broke out at 12.45am on Thursday between the mob backing the suspects and a group wanting them to be arrested on the hospital premises. “There was utter chaos at the hospital as the two groups fought a pitched battle, leaving Shah with head injuries, of which he later died,” Bacchav said. Shah’s family initially refused to take the body, but agreed to do so on Thursday evening after the police promised that action would be taken against those responsible for his death. Police have filed two separate FIRs in the two incidents. In the first case, 19 people have been booked for attacking the police and 10-12 others for the group clash. All have been charged under sections 353, 307, 225 of the IPC. Three people have been booked for murder. Dhule district collector Sanjay Yadav and Dighavkar have appealed to the people of the town to maintain peace. “The situation in Dondaicha is under control. We have deployed adequate police security to ensure that there is no further incident,” Dighavkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/mob-attacks-police-stn-in-dhule-1-dead-6-hurt/articleshow/81853144.cms||---

The complainant, Hitesh Patel, stated that he lives with his parents at Unique Ashiyana in Gota. He said that on February 15, he was at home and had gone to the parking area to get a sanitizer bottle from his car. He stated that when he returned he saw a man who had entered his house and was taking photographs and videos of his house.

Twinkle is Hitesh’s wife, but on May 26 she had left the house and went to live with her parents. Patel stated that he even showed the man an order from a court which had on February 9, set aside the inquiry against him in a case filed by Twinkle at Ramol police station. Patel asked the man for his identity card and demanded a copy of the application. The man, later identified as Umesh Katheriya, did not furnish any identity card and insisted that Hitesh and his family were illegally occupying the house. Katheriya then began arguing with the family. Patel then took photographs of him and Katheriya began to flee. The building security guard tried to stop him, but he threatened them saying he was a cop. Patel said he immediately shared the photograph with his cousin Rohit, who said the person in the picture was Umesh Katheriya, who works for a bank and lives in Vastral.

The court also slapped a fine of Rs 21 lakh on M Prakash, a resident of Karumandi Chettipalayam near Perundurai in Erode district, and issued an arrest warrant against him for not appearing before the court on Thursday.The court had issued an arrest warrant against Prakash’s younger brother M Mahesh, 28, last year for abstaining from court proceedings. He is still at large.A court source said the siblings had started a country chicken farm at Kunnathurampalayam near Annur in 2011 and lured 16 people to invest in the firm by offering two schemes. “They promised a return of Rs 10,000 per month for 36 months and a yearly bonus of Rs 10,000 on every investment of Rs 1.5 lakh and monthly payment and yearly bonus of Rs 12,500 on every investment of Rs 1.25 lakh. In both the schemes, investors were promised 350 country chicks and return of the capital amount at the end of the investment tenure, which was 36 months,” the source said.The 16 together invested Rs 41 lakh in the firm, which failed to fulfil the promises. In November 2012, one of the investors - C Rajan, 52, of Mangalakaraipudur near Karamadai – approached the Economic Offence Wing police, who arrested the siblings. The case trial was held before the TNPID court. While Mahesh went into hiding, Prakash used to appear before the court for the hearings. However, Prakash too didn’t turn up before the court on Thursday, when judge A S Ravi pronounced the verdict and sentenced him to 10 years of imprisonment. The judge issued a warrant against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/30-year-old-man-gets-10-yrs-jail-for-duping-16-investors-of-rs-41l/articleshow/81859206.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The district also recorded a death due to the virus, taking the death toll to 694.The rising active cases prompted the Coimbatore collector to inform Codissia to hand over its premises to set up a Covid care centre after the election.The announcement that vaccination is now open to people aged 45 and above made no difference in Coimbatore, where even youngsters older than 21 have been getting the vaccine for the past two-and-a-half weeks.However, the growing shortage of the vaccine led to the number of beneficiaries sharply dropping over the last four days. While 6,018 people got the shot on Thursday, it was 4,173 on Wednesday, 5,393 on Tuesday and 9,808 people on Monday. “The numbers have definitely dropped from 8,500 people taking it daily during the second week,” said an official.Shortage of Covaxin was more acute in the district, with hardly 64 doses administered in the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital. “There are less than 200 doses in the district in storage and in government hospitals,” said the official.PHCs, including that at Saravanampatti, Vadavalli and Ganapathy turned away people citing vaccine shortage. “We will get new stock on Friday,” the official said. The 280 cases included a massive cluster of 12 people at the LIC office on Trichy Road. All employees have been tested and even those who tested negative have been asked to isolate.“Besides LIC office, we have come across family clusters of three to four people each. The number of containment houses within corporation limits has increased to 62,” said city health officer Dr S Raja.Though the deputy director of public health was hospitalized at PSG Hospitals on Thursday, health officers said he tested negative for the virus in the RT-PCR test.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/280-fresh-covid-cases-recorded/articleshow/81862148.cms||---

---||Goa||State sending samples to NIV to look for new strains||Panaji: Last month, the health services sent 15 samples to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, to determine if any new Covid-19 strain is in circulation in the state, reports of which are awaited. From now on, every month, the health services will send at least 15 samples to NIV. “We do not have the facility for genomic sequencing in Goa. We need to send samples to NIV Pune. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has directed us to send samples from the pool of positive samples for testing every month so that they can be put for genomic sequencing,” state epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar told TOI, replying to a query if a new strain was detected in the state. To know if any new strain is present in Goa, Betodkar said that they will have to wait for the test results of samples sent to NIV. The Goa Medical College (GMC) and North Goa district hospital conduct conventional RTPCR tests, other facilities, including that of private hospitals, do the TrueNat RTPCR test, he said. GMC dean Dr S M Bandekar said that Goa ought to have a genomic testing facility. The RTPCR test is carried out for people who have succumbed to the virus. “In some cases, we have seen patients turning critical in no time and dying. We do not know whether they had the mutant strain or any other new strain. For genomic sequencing, we rely on NIV, Pune,” Bandekar said. Apart from the samples of the four UK returnees that showed the presence of the new UK strain two months ago, no strain other than the regular strain has been detected in the state so far, Betodkar said. “All four were kept in isolation and sent home only after their test results returned negative,” he said. Betodkar, however, said that whether there is a regular strain or any mutant strain of Covid-19 the hospital management of Covid patients as well as that of the public remains unchanged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-sending-samples-to-niv-to-look-for-new-strains/articleshow/81862322.cms||---

AIADMK is the only party that has a genuine concern for the welfare of the community,” Palaniswami said, addressing a public meeting at Codissia grounds. “Muslim and Christian communities should not trust DMK. Minorities have nothing to fear when AIADMK is in power.”AIADMK will also renovate 7,000 temples when it comes to power, the CM said.“Deputy speaker Pollachi V Jayaraman and municipal administration minister S P Velumani want to bifurcate Coimbatore and create a new district with Pollachi as headquarters. The government is considering their demand,” Palaniswami said.“We held talks with the Kerala government to implement the Anamalayar–Nallaru reservoir project. It will be executed after AIADMK comes to power for the third consecutive time. Work for the Athikadavu–Avinashi groundwater recharge and drinking water supply scheme has started in Coimbatore. Thondamuthur, Mettupalayam, Kavundampalayam and Annur areas will be included in phase -II of the project,” he said“DMK president M K Stalin is telling people that AIADMK did not do anything for the welfare of the people. We implemented many schemes across the state and several of them were implemented in Coimbatore. The AIADMK government announced the 6,700 crore-worth metro rail project for Coimbatore city and a detailed project report has been prepared.”“The government has sanctioned 1,620 crore to construct an elevated highway for 10km on Avinashi Road, which will be the longest elevated highway in the state. Flyover construction work has started at Kavundampalayam and GN Mills,” he said.The CM requested voters to cast their votes for AIADMK candidates and BJP candidate Vanathi Srinivasan.Earlier, the chief minister campaigned for the party candidate Pon Jaselan in Gudalur. In a bid to woo the electorate in Gudalur (reserve) constituency, Palaniswami promised to consider positively their long-pending demand to amend Section 17 of the Gudalur Janmam Land Act.He also came down on the DMK chief stating M K Stalin could be conferred with the Nobel Prize for lying. “He had collected petitions from the public in 2019 by taking them into confidence that their grievances will be looked into within 100 days. What is the result?”Taking on DMK leader A Raja, the chief minister said the Nilgiris MP had no respect for women and the same was the case with other leaders in his party.He also assured to solve the issues that were faced by the people residing in the elephant corridor and declare the Nilgiris as an international tourist place. “The AIADMK will come to power again and as the chief minister I will come and inaugurate the Ooty medical college and hospital, which is being built on par with international standards.”While campaigning for the AIADMK candidate Kappachi D Vinoth in Coonoor town and BJP candidate M Bhojarajan, who is contesting from Ooty constituency, he said the Nilgiris was Amma’s favourite and very close to her heart. “And she loved the people here the most.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dmk-creating-wedge-between-minorities-aiadmk-palaniswami/articleshow/81862216.cms||A Subburaj

Pravin Meghwal, late on Wednesday night appeared before Adalaj police and confessed to having killed his ex- girlfriend over suspicions that she was romantically involved with another man. Having heard the confession, teams of Adalaj police and the Gandhinagar fire brigade rushed to the pond near the Adalaj canal and began searching for the body.  Operations were later halted on Wednesday night and began again on Thursday morning, when the body was recovered. Inspector J H Sindhav of Adalaj police said Meghwal worked for an imitation jewellery company in Chandlodia for around four years. “He used to pass through a lane in Chandlodia, where the girl lived with her parents, on his way to his workplace and they began seeing each other. For around a year, they were in a relationship till February, when the girl told him that she wanted to break up,” said Sindhav. Sindhav added that Meghwal was angry about this and on Wednesday called the girl to meet him at a spot near the Adalaj canal where they used to meet earlier. The girl came there and they were talking under a babool tree, near a pond and the accused was trying to convince her to patch up. She was firm on not having a romantic relationship with him, said Sindhav. He said that they then got into heated arguments during which Meghwal throttled her in anger and she lost consciousness. “Meghwal then pushed her into the pond. At that time, he did not know whether she had died or was unconscious,” said Sindhav. He later called his employer and relatives telling them that he had killed his ex-girlfriend. On the instructions of his employer and relatives, he went to Adalaj police station and surrendered to the cops, said Sindhav. Sindhav said Meghwal was booked for murder and an investigation was started.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-strangles-pushes-ex-girlfriend-into-pond/articleshow/81862370.cms||---

This time around, we are seeing a very steep curve,” the AIIMS director said. A similar situation is being witnessed in the national capital, he added.Till about a month ago, Delhi was recording 130 to 140 cases daily. However, in the last one week, the daily tally has increased 10 times. On Thursday, the city recorded 2,790 new cases—highest in over three months. The number of cumulative cases stood at 6,65,220.Dr Guleria said that presence of mutated strains of the virus that causes Covid-19, most importantly the UK strain, which has high transmissibility, is an important factor behind the sudden surge. However, he added, the lack of Covid-appropriate behaviour — wearing masks in public places, social distancing and washing hands regularly — was the main reason.“People have developed a fatigue to the situation. They want to go out, party and travel even though the cases are rising. One of the reasons behind this is that this time around the young are more affected and the severity of symptoms among them is lesser. However, we must realise that eventually the young may spread the infection to the elderly people and those with comorbidities and we might witness overwhelming healthcare infrastructure once again,” Dr Guleria said.He stressed on the need to vaccinate people against Covid-19 at a faster pace and bring back the focus on testing, tracking, isolation and treating persons who are found positive for the disease. “It may not be feasible to impose lockdown again. But, if necessary, there should be some restriction on non-essential travel,” the AIIMS director said.He added that in areas where there is a cluster of new cases, micro-containment zones may be created to prevent disease spread. “If we don’t control the situation now, it may get difficult to deal with its effects at a later stage. Hospitals may get flooded with requests for admissions. Already, we are seeing 200% rise in requests for Covid-19 beds in Delhi,” added Dr Guleria.Non-Covid patients may also get affected if the healthcare infrastructure and manpower remain occupied with Covid-19 leading to more problems and deaths, doctors warn.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/situation-grim-were-staring-at-another-full-blown-crisis-guleria/articleshow/81859251.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Inspector general (IG) of Meerut zone, Praveen Kumar, has ordered a probe after the complainant, Hemant Goyal, approached him. The station house officer (SHO) of Meerut’s Nauchandi police station, Prem Chand Sharma, is known for his unique style of functioning. He “purifies” complainants with the sprinkle of holy Ganga water and chants “sanitization mantra” in Sanskrit. He claims that the exercise has helped him maintain law and order in his jurisdiction. “No FIR was registered despite the fact that my client was brutally assaulted by the accused,” said Ram Kumar, the lawyer representing Goyal. Local police later registered an FIR. In a tweet, Meerut police said, “Based on the complaint of the victim, an FIR under relevant sections was registered at Nauchandi police station. An impartial investigation is being done based on the medical report and evidence. Today, a baseless allegation of FIR not being registered is being leveled by the complainant.” SHO Sharma believes that the practice helps him keep a tab on crime. “People have become less aggressive. They come here and calmly give their complaint. The entire Nauchandi area has become quiet. At the same time, we are not backing away from police action against miscreants,” he said. For the last few days, the SHO has been giving the ‘Gangajal’ bottles as Holi gifts to the visitors requesting them to refrain from liquor. In a video, the SHO says: “Straight from the laps of Mother Ganga, this (Gangajal) is a pure, natural sanitizer. Apart from this, we have a ‘sanitization mantra’. It has been with us for thousands of years. I am not doing anything new but just recalling our ancient heritage.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/assault-victim-told-to-chant-gayatri-mantra-go-on-haridwar-pilgrimage-ig-orders-probe/articleshow/81856035.cms||Piyush Rai
---||Ahmedabad||High court junks GPSC’s method to fill women’s quota in forest dept||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court has criticized the state government for its improper implementation of women’s reservation with regard to recruitment in the forest department for the posts of assistant conservator of forest and the range forest officer. On Wednesday, the bench of Justice Vineet Kothari and Justice Biren Vaishnav held that the Gujarat Public Service Commission’s (GPSC) decision of lowering cut-off marks for women candidates by 10% than the last male candidates in each category was against the rule and paved the way for the male candidates to occupy the posts reserved for women. The bench cited the recent Supreme Court’s observation that “the structures of our society have been created by males for males” and ordered the government to remove 21 male candidates, who were appointed in the place of eligible female candidates by misinterpreting the 30% women’s quota rule on the advice of the advocate general in 2001. The court ordered GPSC to set things right and give appointment to 21 eligible female candidates by removing male candidates from the posts. It said that the government can keep the 21 male candidates on contractual basis or they may try in next recruitment drive. It ordered GPSC to grant appointment to women candidates by the formula given by a division bench last year. The recruitment process on the posts of ACF and RFO and the litigation has lasted for more than a decade and the HC has once again pulled up the authorities for considering women inferior to men. The court said that the method of reducing cut-off marks for women has no “rational nexus” with the policy. It said that this method of implementing women’s reservation “was nothing but taking by the left hand what was given by the right hand to the women folks in the said recruitment process”. The court expressed reservation against the method of reduction of cut-off marks in comparison with male candidates and said,  “This comparison and linkage per se is gender discrimination and unnecessarily views females as inferior mortals or less intelligent than males, which they are not.” It said that this is “abhorrent and unpalatable idea”. On the argument of gender equality, the high court said, “Today, with the advancement of education, technology and women empowerment in India, the women folks are entering the public service from the post of peon to the post of pilots for fighter planes, scientists, doctors, CAs, and lawyers being other lot of professionals; and with so many IT professionals in both genders, they are doing great service to the nation and their equality is not now a farfetched dream in our country but a stark reality.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/high-court-junks-gpscs-method-to-fill-womens-quota-in-forest-dept/articleshow/81862206.cms||---

According to police, the accused Kishor Tavade (25) asked the girl to come along with him when she was playing outside her home. Since the girl knew Tavade she obediently went along with him. The accused took her in an open ground behind gram panchayat office where he allegedly raped her. Police said that when the girl screamed, Tavade gagged her with a piece of cloth.Later when the girl walked back towards her house after Tavade dropped her nearby, her grandmother asked how her clothes had become dirty. The girl, who was in a state of shock, could not speak and was shivering so her grandmother took her inside and asked her in presence of her mother. When her mother also asked her, the girl narrated her trauma. The family too was shocked on hearing about the crime and they immediately went to the nearby police station and lodged a complaint. Based on the complaint, an offence of abduction, rape and violation of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act was registered at the University police station. “We arrested the accused on Wednesday late night and on Thursday morning the medical examination was also completed,” said inspector A S Chavda. He added that Tavade lives in a rented house in the same neighbourhood as the girl’s family with his wife and two children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/truck-driver-rapes-eight-year-old-after-gagging-her/articleshow/81856112.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Assembly passes ‘love jihad’ bill||Gandhinagar: The Gujarat assembly on Thursday passed a bill proposing amendments to the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act, 2003 paving way for more stringent punishment against forced religious conversions through marriage. The amendment bill provides for up to ten years of jail for `fradulent' or `forced' conversion by marriage. As per the government, the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Bill, 2021 sought to curtail “emerging trend in which women are lured to marriage for the purpose of religious conversion”. The main opposition Congress voted against the bill. The BJP government claimed that ‘love jihad’ or forced conversion had become a major law and order issue. After amendments, the Act has sufficient provisions against any type of forced conversion or conversion through fraudulent ways, the party claimed. Proposing the amendments, minister of state for home, Pradipsinh Jadeja, said, “The Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act, 2003 seeks to deal with religious conversion, through allurement, force or by misrepresentation or by any other fraudulent means. Hindu girls have been lured by ‘vidharmi’ boys using fake Hindu names and thereafter forcefully converted to other religions. Tablighi Jamat and other such organizations which want to destabilize Indian Hindu population fund such activities in an organized way,” said Jadeja. The minister said that not only girls but their parents and family members also face life threats and harassment. “Social organizations like RSS and VHP, which try to save the girls and their families from harassment, face life threats too, so it has become a law and order problem and amendments to the law are required,” Jadeja said. The Congress vehemently opposed the Bill. Participating in the debate, the leader of opposition and senior Congress leader Paresh Dhanani said, “Why has the BJP desisted from using the words “love jihad” in the proposed amendments? The fact is when outside the assembly, the BJP leaders never miss any opportunity to use “love jihad” in their speeches. This clearly shows that the BJP wants to mislead people and the whole amendment exercise is for political gains only,” said Dhanani. The bill was passed after a day-long discussion in the House. Cong MLA tears apart copy of bill While protesting the amendments to the Freedom of Religion Act, 2003, Congress MLA from Jamalpur-Khadia, Imran Khedawala tore a copy of the bill on the last day of the budget session in Gujarat state assembly on Thursday. “Home Minister Pradipsinh Jadeja has only mentioned that the daughters of the Hindu community are targeted by men from a specific community. Daughters, be it from any religious community, will always be our daughters. I too have over hundred testimonies of Muslim girls marrying into other religion,” he said, adding the bill is aimed at only one community.

The meeting will also consider measures needed to strengthen the response to the recent spurt. Health minister Satyendar Jain, along with officials of health, revenue and other departments concerned, will participate in the meeting. The government will try to identify the problem areas that need more attention. The departments have also been asked to present an action plan. Several areas in the country have been witnessing a surge in Covid cases. The positivity rate is also going up. Delhi government has taken several containment steps such as random testing at the airport, railway stations and bus terminals for people coming from high-risk states. The occupancy rate of beds in hospitals is also going up, prompting the government to increase Covid general and ICU beds by 25%. Delhi has got an additional 1,072 beds, including 230 ICU ones. Only 25% of the existing beds are currently occupied, but the government has made advance arrangements as Delhi also receives patients from outside. The district-level monitoring has been intensified to check the spread at the local level. Tracing of up to a minimum of 30 contacts for every Covid-positive person is being done to identify the infection early to ensure minimum spread of the virus and also to offer early medical care. In the wake of Covid protocols like wearing of masks being violated rampantly in public places, Kejriwal has directed the authorities to crack down on offenders. A daily target of conducting 80,000 tests has also been set. The government is also trying to ensure that the maximum number of eligible people are vaccinated at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kejriwal-convenes-an-emergency-meeting-amid-surge-in-cases/articleshow/81859294.cms||AlokKNMishra

The police had raided a shop in Dongri and booked the man in 2016 after receiving “secret information” that Bangladeshi nationals were residing there illegally. “I have arrived at the conclusion that prosecution utterly failed to prove that accused being Bangladeshi infiltrator had entered into India without having valid document of travel through unauthorised route and stayed here,” the court said. The accused, Ramjan Shaikh, had been slapped with a case under the Passport (Entry into India) Rules and the Foreigners Act. The court held that while Aadhaar, ration and PAN cards and driving licence cannot be cited to prove citizenship of the country, birth, bona fide and domicile certificates and passport can be relied upon to establish the origin of any person. “Even the election card can be said to be sufficient proof of citizenship as while applying for the election card or voting card, a person has to file declaration with the authority in view of form 6 of ‘Peoples Representation Act’ to the authority that he is citizen of India and if the declaration is found false, he is liable for punishment,” the court said. The court relied on the original documents that were submitted by the accused man to establish his nationality as Indian.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/birth-certificate-rescues-man-held-for-illegal-stay/articleshow/81865716.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Goa||Get vaccinated every day of April, including Sundays, says health department||PANAJI: The response for the new phase of vaccination that was opened for 45-years-old and above on Thursday, was less than satisfactory as 2,113 people received their first shot of vaccine on the first day. To give a push to the drive, health services will conduct vaccinations throughout April, including on Sundays. “The government has given instructions that we conduct vaccination on all days and we will follow them. We are attempting to have vaccinations on all 30 days this month. Even tomorrow (Good Friday), all our centres will have a vaccination,” said Dr Rajendra Borkar, district immunisation officer. Borkar said that though people’s response on the first day was not very encouraging, they expect to see an improvement in the next few days. “We will have a better response from tomorrow. I presume today being the first day, not many people came to take a vaccine. Besides, people are in a festive mood, while some are still unaware that they have to get vaccinated,” he said. Borkar said that they want to administer 5,000 doses a day in order to finish their target of vaccinating 3 lakh people (45 plus and above) in 59 days. On Thursday, 4,398 doses were administered to people of all categories of healthcare workers (HCW), frontline workers (FLW), 60-plus, and those who are 45-59 years old. To hasten the speed of vaccination, the health services will hold vaccination sessions in the industrial estates across the state. As of Thursday, 1,23,601 doses were administered, including 10,563 HCWs who were vaccinated with both doses. The number of senior citizens who have been fully vaccinated till Thursday was 2,552. The health services have a mammoth task of covering 1.5 lakh senior citizens. “Response from this category (senior citizens) has been lukewarm. I don’t see a significant change in people’s attitude though may have their own justification for refraining from getting a vaccine shot,” he said. The vaccination sessions in the state are held at 37 government facilities and 25 private hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/get-vaccinated-every-day-of-april-including-sundays-says-health-dept/articleshow/81862447.cms||---
---||Meerut||Now, triple talaq petitioner wins alimony battle, asks women to join fight||MEERUT: In yet another victory for Atiya Sabri, one of the six petitioners in the Supreme Court against instant triple talaq, a family court in Uttar Pradesh’s Saharanpur has directed her estranged husband to give her a monthly maintenance of Rs 21,000 so that she can raise her two daughters. The trial lasted over five years; in between Atiya had also petitioned the Supreme Court which outlawed the 1,400-year-old practice in August 2017, already banned in at least 22 countries, including Pakistan and Bangladesh. Besides the alimony, Atiya will also get an arrear of Rs 13.4 lakh as the case had been filed more than five years ago. Atiya’s turbulent marriage had ended with the birth of her second daughter. She had claimed that her husband and in-laws forced her out of the house for giving birth to a second girl child in 2015. She also alleged that they were asking for Rs 20lakh in dowry. Atiya approached the Saharanpur court on November 24, 2015, about 20 days after getting a letter from her husband, Wajid Ali, with the word ‘talaq’ written thrice on it in Hindi. Married on March 24, 2012, she was given the instant ‘talaq’ on November 2, 2015. Read AlsoMP: FIR against man for giving triple talaq to wifeINDORE: A 27-year-old woman from Indore in Madhya Pradesh has lodged an FIR against her husband for giving her triple talaq, a practice now banned under law, police said on Monday. The couple got married on February 7, 2016. However, the woman left her husband's house in the state's Dewas districtAtiya called it a "victory of honour". She told TOI, “More than the money, it is a victory of my honour, mera samman. I am satisfied that I will be able to raise my two daughters in a decent manner. God has been kind. I have gone through immense pain but I feel blessed that He chose me for this purpose, be it the fight for the triple ‘talaq’ law or winning this alimony case. This should come as a great relief to all women of our community. More and more women who have been facing harassment should come forward.” Asked about the case in the family court, she said, “I argued that when marriage is a contract between two individuals, why only the man is given the right to decide to break it. Why does a woman have no say in it? She should have equal right after all.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/now-triple-talaq-petitioner-wins-alimony-battle-asks-women-to-join-fight/articleshow/81856163.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Kochi||EMCC International not among shortlisted firms after ASCEND||Thiruvananthapuram: Deepening the lack of transparency in the government deal with marine firm EMCC International, documents from the industries department prove that EMCC did not figure among potential investors, who were shortlisted, with nodal officers being assigned to each for follow-up action after ASCEND 2020 meet in Kochi on Jan 10, 2020. As per the order issued by industries department on Feb 4, 2020, (accessed by TOI), department officers were assigned to assist investors with whom MoUs and letters of intent (LoIs) were signed. Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation had signed 23 MoUs and 40 LoIs representing the government. Similarly, Kinfra and the directorate of industry and commerce had signed MoUs and LoIs with various investors, which according to the order comes to the tune of Rs 96,355 crore in project promises. However, EMCC does not figure in the list of investors for whom nodal officers were assigned for follow-up action, though the MoU in question (accessed by TOI) reads that it is being entered between EMCC International India Pvt Ltd and the government of Kerala on Jan 10, 2020, for promotion and upgradation of the ‘deep-sea fishing industry’, with an investment of Rs 5,000 crore. Also, in contrast with the main text of MoU, the actual date of signing the MoU, seen against the names of signatories, shows that it was signed on Feb 28, 2020. It remains unclear why the government actually entered into an MoU with the company almost two months after ASCEND was held though the MoU reads that it is being signed ‘on Friday, the 10th day of January 2020 at the Lulu Bolgatty International Convention Centre, Grand Hyatt, Kochi’, which is the date and venue of ASCEND. It would appear that signing the MoU were prolonged for two months after the event to secure a political clearance to sign it. Government has not yet issued a formal order or legally-valid instrument that cancels its MoU with EMCC. Under mounting pressure, on Wednesday it released a copy of a note dated Feb 24, 2021 from industries minister EP Jayarajan addressed to KSIDC MD MG Rajamanickam, asking him to cancel the MoU on grounds of violation of government policy. This would also expose the government’s claim that all MoUs were scrutinized by the empowered committee before execution. The government order constituting the empowered committee has also been conspicuously taken off from the website of the department of industries and commerce. A note from KSIDC MD to the principal secretary (industries) saying that the MoU has been cancelled and the matter has been informed to the company, was also released by the government. These two being merely part of internal communication within the government, cannot invalidate a MoU entered into by the government, say legal experts. The chief minister, while answering questions raised by media in Kannur, referred only to the note given by the industries minister and did not cite a government decision that actually cancelled the MoU. Meanwhile, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala claimed that the MoU is still valid and the government is purposefully lying about it. He alleged that the government hopes that it can go ahead with MoU if they manage to return to power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/emcc-international-not-among-shortlisted-firms-after-ascend/articleshow/81856245.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Pune||JMFC surrenders in graft case, cop custody till April 5||Pune: A special anti-corruption court on Thursday rejected a regular bail application of judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) Archana Jatkar from the Vadgaon Maval court and ordered her remand in police custody till April 5 in an alleged graft case after she surrendered before the court. “Considering the scope of investigation, custodial interrogation of the accused is absolutely necessary, it cannot be dispensed with only because the accused is a judicial officer,” special judge S R Navander said in his order. “The status of a particular person cannot become a hurdle for the investigation,” the judge said. On January 13, the state anti-corruption bureau (ACB) trapped Shubhavari Bhalchandra Gaikwad, alias Mhatre Madam, under the Kiwale flyover on the charge of demanding Rs2.5 lakh and accepting Rs50,000 from a dairy farmer “on behalf of the JMFC for managing decision in a criminal case in his favour”. A case was registered with the Dehu Road police during the early hours of January 14 and the ACB later arrested two more persons. It has since claimed to have collected evidence to show a nexus between Gaikwad and JMFC Jatkar and was pursuing the latter’s arrest. In a plea filed on Thursday through public prosecutor Vilas Ghogare-Patil, the ACB told the court that Gaikwad had contacted seven to eight litigants, other than the complainant (dairy farmer), offering help to secure favourable decisions in their land disputes. Investigations established that all these cases were pending before JMFC Jatkar, the ACB told the court. Deputy superintendent of police (ACB) Seema Mehendale said in the plea that the ACB wanted to probe two more names, including that of a judge, which Gaikwad dropped in her conversation while making the alleged bribe demand. “Jatkar’s involvement in the alleged crime has been established and the ACB needed to collect her voice samples for evidence besides interrogating her over the 147 calls she exchanged with Gaikwad prior to the trap. In one of the voice recordings, Jatkar is heard telling Gaikwad that she will get the work done in favour of the complainant,” the plea stated. The court’s order stated, “At this juncture, it is necessary to note that the present accused (Jatkar) is the key person of the crime. The actions of other accused were depending upon her moves and directions.” It added, “The investigating officer has specifically stated that she has to interrogate the accused not only regarding the incident mentioned in the present crime but some other instances also, the mobile phone found with the accused has to be seized, her connections with the other accused have to be searched and for that purpose inquiry of accused is necessary while in custody.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/jmfc-surrenders-in-graft-case-cop-custody-till-april-5/articleshow/81859321.cms||Vishwas Kothari
---||Mumbai||State & Mumbai city record daily case peaks, max deaths in months||MUMBAI: Maharashtra and Mumbai both reported steep increases in Covid-19 cases — new daily peaks for both — and fatalities on Thursday. It comes a day before CM Uddhav Thackeray’s review meeting on Friday, where a decision on further restrictions on public movement and other possible curbs like shutting down high footfall places like malls, cinema halls, religious places is likely to be announced. Maharashtra added 43,183 cases and 249 deaths, the fatalities being the highest since November 5 (256). This is also the second day in a row that the state has added over 200 deaths. The state’s total caseload rose to 28.5 lakh and deaths to 54,898. Mumbai added 8,646 cases, a significant jump from its previous high of 6,933 cases reported on March 28. The city also reported 18 deaths, the highest in nearly four months since December 5 when 19 deaths were reported. The rise in deaths comes even as authorities have been saying that though cases have been surging, most have been mild or asymptomatic and deaths had remained low. Dr T P Lahane, head of the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), said rising deaths is a cause for worry but it’s still not alarming when seen from the perspective of case fatality rate. “We are no doubt adding more deaths but we are in a better situation than September when there were 5 lakh cases but over 12,000 deaths,” he said. Barring Latur, Aurangabad, and to some extent Pune, hospital beds are available in most parts. “People simply need to see a doctor on time and not ignore their symptoms,” he added. Mumbai’s total case tally touched 4.2 lakh and deaths 11,708 on Thursday. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region’s (MMR) total case tally crossed 9 lakh. Members of the Covid task force attributed the rise in cases to more tests and data transparency. Civic officials said as many as 46,758 tests were carried out on Thursday, the second highest in recent times. Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar warned strict lockdown measures are expected soon. These could include travel restrictions on local trains. “In the new restrictions that might be announced soon, malls and religious places may be shut, and shops may be asked to open on alternate days. The state government might restrict local train use to essential workers only.” The MMR continued to add the highest cases in the state (14,786) and the Nagpur region recorded 64 deaths, the highest in the state. Thane city recorded the sharpest spike since the start of the pandemic with around 1,432 fresh cases on Thursday. As many as five deaths were also reported, taking the virus toll to 1,395.

This was stated by the Punjab and Haryana high court while directing Panjab University to complete the senate poll process within two months. The directions were issued by Justice Fateh Deep Singh in an order of March 23, the detailed copy of which was made available on Thursday. The HC order said, “It (election) leads to accountability and raising of conscious level, resulting in better and efficient running and governance of an institution. The purpose of elections…ensures that the main administration of the university is vested with the senate which looks after each and every functioning of it.” It said putting elections on hold was in utter violation of the Act and the Regulations governing the respondent university and therefore unconstitutional. “The respondent is directed to ensure that the electoral process is completed within two months of the date of receipt of a copy of this order. The petition stands disposed of as allowed accordingly,” the order said. The petition was filed by Keshav Malhotra and six others. The former senators wanted the quashing of the August 15, 2020, orders of the V-C to defer the elections indefinitely.An appeal was also made to set aside the October 16, 2020, communication of the UT administration, asking PU to defer the elections. Recently, UT had communicated to PU authorities that it should take a decision to conduct senate polls on its own. The petitioners had alleged that certain candidates had pressurised the university administration and their political bosses to defer the elections. They then started another agenda for replacing the senate with a committee comprising representatives of the ruling political party who would be nominated by the office of the chancellor, also the Vice-President of India, through the home affairs ministry, it was alleged.According to the petition, the V-C did not have jurisdiction to defer the elections and should have brought the matter before the syndicate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/complete-senate-poll-process-within-2-months-hc-to-pu/articleshow/81859327.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

While commuters feel that the rise in toll for an incomplete road is not justified, representatives of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) explained that the increased amount has nothing to do with the condition of the road.NHAI project director Suhas Chitnis said, “The rise in toll is not just happening in Maharashtra but across India. The contractual process needs to be followed. The delay is due to new infrastructural demands cropping up, which need to be implemented. The contractor invests his money to construct the road and charges toll to those using it. Of the toll collected, 50% is given as premium to NHAI and the rest used for construction. Two structures have already been completed along the stretch and work is on for another two. The work is expected to be completed by the end of June.”Meanwhile, Velankar has written to Union road and surface transport minister Nitin Gadkari urging him to act against the contractor for not completing the work within the deadline. “NHAI has only given notices to the contractor concerned but no further action is taken. Many road works are pending and there are no service roads at many places. Service roads that exist are in very poor condition. It is the contractor’s responsibility to repair the road, but many stretches are riddled with potholes,” Velankar has stated in the letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/5-increase-in-toll-while-roadwork-still-incomplete-irks-commuters/articleshow/81859325.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||GST collection in state down 5.8% in 2020-21||Ahmedabad:Reduced economic and commercial activity due to the lockdown, territorial restrictions and subsequent dip in demand, caused the GST collection in Gujarat to erode by 5.8% in the financial year 2020-21. The GST mop-up from Gujarat stood at Rs 74,347 crore in 2020-21, down against Rs 78,944 crore in 2019-20. Officials of the state commercial tax department attributed the low collection to the first two quarters of 2020-21, when the tax collection significantly declined. J P Gupta, state commercial tax commissioner, said, “GST collection in the last quarter was phenomenally good. All activities were shut in the first quarter, whereas economic and social activities were down, which caused the mop-up to remain low in the first two quarters. Economy is on the rise because there is pent-up demand and regular consumption since the last two quarters. This gave a good momentum to tax revenues in the last two quarters.” Tax department sources revealed that even though there was slowdown in the initial part of the year, tax collection in the second half of 2020-21 began improving. In fact, GST mop-up grew by a significant 20% in March 2021 against the same month last year. According to the data provided by Union ministry of finance, GST collection in March stood at Rs 8,197 crore in March 2020. In March, interestingly, Gujarat’s revenue through SGST remained at an all-time high level of Rs 3,523 crore of which Rs 708 crore was IGST settlement, according to state commercial tax department officials. Tax officials also attributed the increase in tax collection to curbs on evasion. “We have tightened the noose against evaders and this has helped us plug loopholes and gaps in a big way. In the past five to six months, we’ve taken a series of actions against defaulters and evaders due to which tax collection has improved,” said a senior tax official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gst-collection-in-state-down-5-8-in-2020-21/articleshow/81859350.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Pune||Recovery agent held on charge of abducting, killing girlfriend||Pune: The boyfriend of the 29-year-old missing woman from Amravati was arrested on Wednesday on the charge of abducting and murdering her at an isolated place at Bhatghar dam in Bhor near Pune, as many as 17 days after she disappeared. A magisterial court sent the suspect (30), a recovery agent with a private company in Amravati, to police custodial remand till April 5. Inspector Sanjay Thopte said on Thursday, “The woman worked as a back-office assistant in a telecom firm in Pune. She and the suspect knew each other for 14 years. The duo were good friends. But the woman became distant from him after she shifted to the city a few months ago.” He said, “The suspect did not like this and often visited the city to meet her. On March 13, the suspect wooed her to accompany him for some work and drove her to the dam on his motorcycle. He then bludgeoned her to death with a stone, dumped her body and sped away.” Thopte said, “One of the victim’s friends registered a missing person’s complaint with the Chandannagar police on March 14 after she did not return to her rented place. The police learnt that the victim and the suspect were friends but his whereabouts were not known. The police registered an abduction case after the victim’s brother filed a complaint against the suspect on March 18.” The Chandannagar police later received information that the victim’s mother had registered an FIR under the Atrocities Act against the suspect with the Chandur police in Amravati on February 14. “The police there had arrested him on March 25. He was sent to Amravati jail after a court remanded him in magisterial custody for 14 days,” Thopte said. The inspector said, “We got custody of the suspect transferred from the jail on March 30 and brought him to Pune. He led the police to the crime scene and we recovered her skeletal remains, garments, cellphone, hair and a blood-stained stone.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/recovery-agent-held-on-charge-of-abducting-killing-girlfriend/articleshow/81859343.cms||---

---||Pune||State seeks 35 lakh doses every week to meet 5 lakh daily jabs target||Pune: The state government has now demanded a weekly supply of 35 lakh vaccine doses from the Centre to increase its coverage, especially after the vaccination drive started for people above 45 on Thursday. On Wednesday, Maharashtra received 26.77 lakh Covishield doses, which were given to districts that have had high Covid-19 caseloads, state immunization officer Dr DN Patil said. He said the districts do have vials in reserve. “This may last 10 days or less, depending on how vaccinations progress. There should be a continuous supply of doses,” he said. Data shows the state currently has about 8.33 lakh doses left. All of them have been distributed among the districts along with the fresh batch of 26.77 lakh doses that were received on Wednesday. Also, while availability of Covishield has improved, distribution of Covaxin continues to be limited. State health officials said with the addition of the above-45 group, the state is now aiming to vaccinate a target population of 4.5 crore people (up from from the earlier 1.77 crore target). The new target would mean an increase in the number of daily jabs and vaccine demand. "We are currently vaccinating nearly 2.7 lakh people daily. With the inclusion of new beneficiaries, the number is likely to increase to 5 lakh per day," an official said. Since January 16 — the day the Covid vaccination programme began — Maharashtra has finished vaccinations of 62.45 lakh beneficiaries, which includes health workers, frontline workers, elderly and people above 45 with comorbidities. From this number, 4.79 lakh health workers and 2.6 lakh frontline workers have received both doses. On Thursday, the Centre, following discussions with the states, decided to carry out vaccinations on all days of April - at both private-run and government vaccination sites. States have been asked to ensure arrangements are in place to conduct the drives on all days, including on holidays. A state official said the new announcement for April means the Centre has to keep releasing more doses, especially for Maharashtra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-seeks-35-lakh-doses-every-week-to-meet-5-lakh-daily-jabs-target/articleshow/81859367.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Hyderabad||For first time, property tax collection crosses Rs 1,700 cr||Hyderabad: The pandemic notwithstanding, for the first time, the property tax collection of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) crossed the Rs 1,700 crore mark this financial year. According to the GHMC, the property tax collected up to March 31 was Rs 1,701 crore. During the last financial year in 2019-20, the civic body has generated Rs 1,472 crore and this year’s collection happens to be higher by Rs 229 crore. As per the tax collection data, out of the 16 lakh plus property tax assesses in the GHMC jurisdiction, 12.20 lakh property owners had paid the tax this fiscal year. In terms of the zone-wise tax collection, Khairtabad zone saw the highest collection of Rs 491.69 crore, followed by Serilingampally zone at Rs 290.28 crore and Kukatpally at Rs 285.84 crore. To increase property tax collections and ensure that at least the principal amount is cleared along with 10% interest, officials said that the civic body has started OTS (one time settlement) scheme, which offers a 90% rebate on arrears accumulated interest, if the arrears are cleared by the property owners at one go. The officials also attributed the increase in property tax to the arrangements made by the Corporation for the convenience of property owners to pay the tax at all municipal circle offices, citizen service centres, via online modes, e-Seva centres and also to bill collectors. “As part of the campaign to encourage people to pay their taxes, we went door-to-door reminding people to pay the tax on time and avoid being penalised and the zonal commissioners of each zone also conducted weekly review meetings with every tax inspector and bill collector of the zone,” a senior official said. DS Lokesh Kumar, GHMC commissioner, also urged taxpayers to avail OTS before the last date and pay the tax dues on time to avoid penalty. However, the civic body could not achieve the set target of Rs 1,900 crore this financial year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/for-first-time-property-tax-collection-crosses-rs-1700-cr/articleshow/81859345.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Vaccination for people aged over 45 started on Thursday. State government plans to cover this age-group within 45 days. Besides the general public, organizers of ceremonies and functions have been asked to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour at all times. “Strengthen surveillance for emergence of clusters and measures for early containment. The districts may analyse the epidemic and identify the panchayat ward/ municipality ward / corporation wards having new cases,” states the advisory. In places where there are new cases, district administration has been asked to scale testing and tracking, besides vaccinating the vulnerable population aged over 45 years. Emphasizing on vaccination, the advisory states that community-based organizations should be encouraged to motivate priority groups to receive vaccination and ensure 100% coverage in the shortest-possible time. Meanwhile, district teams have been asked to hold talks with Confederation of Indian Industries and encourage industries to hold vaccination camps for present and retired staff. “Mobile vaccination units are to be planned and organized so as to ensure primary care level of delivery of services, especially to elderly people,” added the advisory.

---||Delhi||12 IM terrorists given life term by court||New Delhi: The Rajasthan module of terror outfit Indian Mujahideen busted by Delhi Police in 2014 has crossed the first judicial scrutiny, with 12 terrorists being sentenced to life imprisonment by a Jaipur court. In March 2014, the anti-terror unit of Delhi Police had managed to lay their hands on an Indian Mujahideen terrorist Zia-ur-Rehman at Ajmer railway station. Better known as Waqas, Rehman was a Pakistani, who had a diploma in food technology from the Government College of Technology in Faisalabad in Pakistan.He had undergone weapon and explosive training at an LeT camp in Naushera and another camp associated with the Jaish-e-Mohammed in the Waziristan Federally Administered Tribal Area.Rehman was placed under IM chief Yasin Bhatkal to make and plant bombs in different parts of the country in early 2000s. His arrest had blown the lid off an otherwise quiet sleeper module in Rajasthan. The entire operation was headed by 1985-batch IPS officer S N Shrivastava, who is presently the police commissioner of Delhi. He was the chief of the anti-terror unit at the time.Seven years later, the conviction has given a much needed boost to the unit which had foiled major terror attacks in the country before the Lok Sabha elections in 2014.The three associates given away by Waqas and arrested by cell were Mohammad Mahruf, 21, Waqar Azhar, 21, and Shaquib Ansari, 25. Police had seized explosive materials, detonators and electronic circuits and timers from them. “The Special Cell then got registered cases under the Explosive Substances Act at Jaipur and Jodhpur. The initial arrests of founding members of Rajasthan Module of IM by Special Cell led to the arrest of ten more terrorists by Rajasthan ATS,” a senior officer recalled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/12-im-terrorists-given-life-term-by-court/articleshow/81859352.cms||Raj Shekhar

Addressing a joint press conference, office bearers of both the committees said that the Covid pandemic has compelled them to impose severe restrictions on the celebration of the festival. They urged the devotees not to crowd the temple for Gulal, and that “darshan” of the deity will be facilitated by putting in place strict SOPs. Shree Ramnath Devasthan temple committee, Zambaulim, had announced last month that Gulal won’t be held this year in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, while the Mathagramastha Hindu Sabha, the chief organisers of the festival, had remained undecided over the matter, thereby leading to confusion among devotees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/zambaulims-gulal-next-week-to-be-limited-to-temple-rituals-only/articleshow/81862676.cms||---
---||---||Didi was trying to get voting done by cops, says Suvendu||NANDIGRAM: BJP candidate Suvendu Adhikari has accused Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee of “violating” the model code of conduct by stalling the polls at a Nandigram booth for about two hours on Thursday. “She alleges that her polling agent was ousted from one booth. But she said nothing when her people pelted the media with stones and injured one person. She is losing political ground. What she did is illegal. She stopped polling for over two hours and did drama. It’s a violation of the model code,” Adhikari said. The BJP candidate also warned the CM about her imminent defeat in the ongoing polls. “She was trying to get the voting done by police. She has lost contact with people. I am on a motorcycle, closer to the ground. I get better feedback myself. This vote is against appeasement,” he said. Suvendu didn’t look stressed for a moment while taking on the most powerful politician from Bengal in Nandigram. He kept moving from Hazrakanta to Satengabari and didn’t even miss out to pay a visit to the bereaved family of the BJP supporter whose body was recovered from the toilet at Bhekutia village on Thursday. “Look at the polling percentage. People are coming out in large numbers. TMC could not field agents in as many as 80 booths. Am I here to supply them agents? We are going to win all the 30 seats,” Suvendu said with a smile while reaching out to the Boyal school, minutes after Banerjee left the spot. Suvendu, in response to Mamata’s comment that the BJP mobilised “outsiders” on the poll day, accused the CM of “insulting” the people of Nandigram and said it had “become her habit”. “She received injuries in an accident but said she was attacked,” he said. The TMC-turned-BJP functionary mocked the CM over the “filthy language” she used. “She is the CM. She should have some restraint. She uses filthy language against the PM. None of our CMs right from Bidhan Roy to Jyoti Basu ever used such language. She described Amit Shah as ‘hodolkutkut’. Are these words from a sane person? She seems to have courted defeat,” Suvendu said. Unlike his opponent, Suvendu began his day early after casting his vote at Nandanayekbar school at 7.10am. He then went for a touch-and-go to polling booths across Nandigram. His first stop was Hazrakanta, and then he moved over to Garchakraberia, Sonachura, Tekhali, Gokulnagar and so on. The BJP candidate took inputs from polling agents and kept posting complaints to the EC and the central forces. “The EC has ensured a peaceful poll. The strong presence of the CRPF gave confidence to voters,” Suvendu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/didi-was-trying-to-get-voting-done-by-cops-says-suvendu/articleshow/81865452.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The man’s wife was also convicted and sentenced to a year in jail for being an illegal immigrant from Bangladesh. The man, Sameer Barai, and his wife, Jyoti, have two children. “There is nothing on record to show that accused no 1 (Sameer) at any point of time reported to police that accused no 2 (Jyoti) is a foreigner. To the contrary, it reveals that he (is) married to accused no 2, and they have two children out of this marriage. No one can suppose that a husband do not (sic) know the basic fact of citizenship of his wife. It is not at all expected. Any sane person can go with the same line of thinking,” the court said. The court directed the prosecution to take “deportation action” against Jyoti after she completes her sentence. Refusing to grant leniency, the court observed that a citizen of the country had committed breach of his “obligatory duty” and left the future of his children in the dark. “Such offending act on the part of accused persons cannot be taken liberally. To my mind, if such leniency is given, the same may prove dangerous to the national security and even to the legitimate rights of Indian citizens as because of such unauthorized entries, the foreigners can give taxation on the economy of India,” the court said. The prosecution case was that in February 2017, the police received information that Bangladeshi nationals would be “illegally arriving” at Reay Road railway station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/man-gets-1-year-jail-for-hiding-wifes-citizenship/articleshow/81865758.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Hyderabad||Cash-for-vote: HC bins accused’s plea||Hyderabad: Justice Shameem Akther of the Telangana high court on Thursday dismissed the discharge petition filed by Rudra Uday Simha, one of the accused, in the cash-for-vote scam case registered by Telangana ACB officials in May 2015. He filed the plea before the high court after the trial court rejected his earlier plea. While Udaya Simha contended that he has got nothing to do with the case or conspiracy and that he was merely used to transport cash, the ACB opposed his version and revealed interesting facts about the case. Justice Shameem Akther agreed with the ACB argument and said that at this stage, the accused cannot be discharged from the case. “Let him prove his case before the trial court that is going ahead with the trial in the case,” the judge said while dismissing Uday Simha’s petition. ACB’s special counsel V Ravi Kiran Rao informed the court that it was Uday Simha who brought Rs 50 lakh in a briefcase to the scene of the offence on May 31, 2015. This cash was used to lure independent MLA Stephenson to vote for the TDP nominee in the 2015 MLC elections. He is a close associate of Congress MP A Revanth Reddy, one of the prime accused in the case, who was arrested on May 31, 2015. The ACB said it was Revanth who got down from his car and went into Uday Simha’s car and instructed him to collect the money and bring the same to the meeting. “Hence, it can be safely assumed that Uday Simha was a part and parcel of this conspiracy. He has prior knowledge about the conspiracy. He played an instrumental role in this case by going to TDP MLC candidate Vem Narender Reddy’s house and collected Rs 50 lakh cash from Narender’s son and brought it to the scene of the offence,” Ravi Kiran said. ACB laid a trap and caught Revanth and others while they were trying to lure and bribe Stephenson. The cash was seized.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cash-for-vote-hc-bins-accuseds-plea/articleshow/81859370.cms||---

Of the 69.829 km of canal network, the state is yet to completed 7,729 km canal network. The state government in a reply tabled to the question raided by Chotila MLA , Rutvik Makwana, stated that according to the revised estimated the maximum work of sub-minor canal was to be completed. The government in the reply stated that canal length may be revised. The delay in completion of the canal network was because of several factors which included delay in permission from oil companies, railways, highway authorities among others. Moreover, delay in land acquisition also another factor. The sub-minor canal network is to be taken up in partnership with the farmers and hence once the permission is obtained from panchayat and individual farmers the work is taken up. Meanwhile in another question raised by Radhanpur MLA, Raghu Desai, the government said that it had put forward a demand of Rs 2,000crore in year 2018-19 and of Rs 967 crore in 2019-2020. But the centre has disbursed only Rs 1,394 crore in 2018-19 and Rs 458 crore in 2019-20. Also the government has admitted that in 2019 and 2020 about 100 breaches have been reported in the canal network in Banaskantha district alone.

Chandy on Thursday released official details about the political murders in Kannur which he got through the Right to Information Act. According to official data, 125 political murders happened in Kannur district during the period 1984-2018. “However, the numbers are much more than this according to unofficial records,” said Chandy. It is the BJP which has lost the highest number of individuals in the political violence. When they lost 53, CPM lost 46, Congress 19 and Muslim League seven members. “The important fact is that the CPM workers are the accused in 78 of these murders. BJP is accused in 39 while there is only one case against the Congress. This makes it very clear that it is the CPM and the BJP that are playing the main role in the political murders in Kannur,” said Chandy. He also said that the data available through RTI makes it clear that the number of political murders comes down during UDF rule while it goes up during the LDF rule. There were 56 political murders in the district during June 2006 to May 2011 when LDF government was in power. In the next five years when UDF was in power there were 25 political murders. CBI is probing six brutal murders that have happened in Kannur and nearby areas. This include the murders of Ariyil Shukkoor, Kathiroor Manoj, Payyoli Manoj, Mohammed Fazal and the double murder in Payyoli. The LDF government is legally spending crores to prevent CBI probe in the murder of Youth Congress leader Suhaib in Mattannur. In all these cases, CPM members are the accused. Kannur is the stronghold of the CPM in the state. Here no other political parties have the freedom to work, Chandy said. “Whoever raises their finger against the CPM here, they will chop it off,” he said. Chandy also released a documentary about the political murders in Kannur ‘Daivathinte Nattile Chorakkalikal’ made by KPCC press secretary P T Chacko at a function at Indira Bhavan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cong-raises-political-violence-as-a-poll-issue/articleshow/81859385.cms||---
---||Delhi||High-voltage Holi, thanks to soaring mercury in Delhi||NEW DELHI: This March has not only been unusually warm, it was the ‘hottest’ March since 2010, with a mean maximum temperature of 33.1 degree Celsius. The rising temperatures are directly impacting the city’s power demand. This March, the peak power demand on 24 days has been higher than the peak power demand on corresponding days in 2020. In fact, on the day of Holi — March 29, 2021 — when the capital witnessed the hottest day in 76 years, the peak power demand was nearly 600 MW and 25% more than the peak power demand on the same day last year, according to sources. On March 29, the maximum temperature was recorded at 40.1 degrees Celsius, the highest since March 1945 Though Delhi has witnessed a peak power demand of more than 4,000 MW on two occasions since 2010, this March is different, as it comes in the middle of a pandemic. Though the Covid-19 outbreak has severely hit power demand, the peak power demand has been going up since restrictions were gradually lifted last year. The peak power demand last month was 3,749 MW, which was actually just a shade lower than that of March 2020 (3,775 MW). On 24 corresponding days, it was up by 56%. On March 31, 2021, the peak power demand was 3,610 MW, while it was 2,306 MW on March 31 last year. From March to mid-May last year, the only power demand in Delhi was from domestic users as most people were home during the lockdown. While the capital had breached the 7,000 MW-mark of peak power demand in 2018, last year the peak power demand recorded was a muted 6,314 MW due to the lockdown and the weather. However, as the restrictions were gradually lifted and shops and offices opened, power consumption went up too. In fact, since August 2020, Delhi’s peak power demand has been higher on 119 corresponding days vis-a-vis the previous year. In August, the figure was higher on six days, on 14 days in September, 17 days in October, 15 days in November and 10 days in December. In 2021, January saw a big surge in demand and on 23 days, the peak power demand was higher than corresponding days in January, 2020. The figure was 10 days in February but 24 days last month, the highest since Delhi recorded the first Covid-19 in March, 2020. This basically means that between August 2020 and March 2021, Delhi’s peak power demand was higher by nearly 50% of the corresponding days, vis-a-vis the previous years. On December 1, 2020, Delhi’s peak power demand was 3,504 MW and since then, the city’s peak power demand has increased by over 50%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/high-voltage-holi-thanks-to-soaring-mercury-in-city/articleshow/81859364.cms||Sidharatha Roy

And soon, you are likely to find these value-added fish products on store shelves in Kashmir. Recently, a team of students and faculty members of Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology (SKUAST-K) visited Veraval after learning about the success story scripted by nearly 300 women of Sagar Manthan Machhimar Utthan Mandal, a cooperative society. These women of the Kharva community have been making and selling over a dozen products including fish pizzas, cheese balls, samosas, burgers, sandwiches, cutlets, pickles, chutneys, and other ready-to-cook fish meals. The cooperative society and the varsity have decided to join hands and sell ‘Made in Veraval’ fish products in Kashmir, under the cooperative’s brand name, on franchise model. What’s more, the Veraval women will also share their formula so that the same delicacies can be made from freshwater fishes in Kashmir. Faisal Rashid, assistant professor-cum-scientist, post-harvest technology said, “We are highly impressed by the work done by these women. We want to set up their franchise in Kashmir. We will start with Srinagar and expand to other districts like Anantnag and Baramulla.”Rashid, who was part of the 35-member group, said, “Learning how to make such value-added fish products will help generate employment for locals in Kashmir.” Ashfauq Aga, assistant professor, aquaculture engineering, added, “People engaged in the fish industry in Kashmir do not have the knowledge to make value-added products. We want to help students passing out of the university to open stores of fish products in various parts of the state like Sopore and Pulwama. There are a large number of hotels and tourist spots where our students can sell these products.” Amrin Shabir, a student of the varsity said “By setting up such franchises, we can generate opportunities for Kashmiri women to earn more profit from fish.”  Shailesh Suyani, president of the cooperative society, added, “We can send soup powder, cheese balls, ready-to-cook products like samosas, noodles, and papads directly to Kashmir for sale. We can also share the formula for other products. This, in turn, will generate more income for our women.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/veravals-fish-on-kashmir-hotel-menus-soon/articleshow/81856410.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Of them, 134 were above 45 years of age without comorbid conditions. About 90% of them were walk-ins," said an employee of the Pruthak Barate hospital. According to the District Health Office, 27,064 beneficiaries (45 years and above with and without underlying conditions) were vaccinated on Thursday, compared to 19,074 elderly.

Vaccination response is bound to surge further over the next few days.” Rajesh Patil, commissioner, PCMC, told TOI, “We clocked our best vaccination figure on Thursday at 11,282 jabs. We are now planning at least 20,000 jabs per day, for which new centres will be opened soon."

The restriction of comorbidity on patients above 45 years of age was lifted by the Central government, leading to increase in number of beneficiaries, said deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan. On Wednesday, only 289, who are between 45 and 59 years old, had taken the jab and the daily figure for the category has remained below 300 in the past two months. Dayalan said, “We believe that this step will boost the vaccination number and help in achieving the target. We are also getting queries from beneficiaries who are above 18 years and hope that the government will soon open vaccination for all age groups.” Mohali administration is giving an option to choose between Covaxin or Covishield, but with a rider. Civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur said Covaxin can only be administered to a cluster of 20 beneficiaries. “A vial if opened must be catered to 20 persons and that too within an hour otherwise it goes waste. As far as Covishield is concerned, it can be given one by one. Many doctors are now prescribing Covaxin depending upon co-morbidities.”Out of the total of 731 beneficiaries, 628 took the first dose of Covishield and 103 took the first shot of Covaxin, she said. Twelve, who are 45+ with comorbidities and had taken the first shot before, took the second dose of Covishield.The civil surgeon said on the day, 861 senior citizens took the first dose of the vaccine and 61 took the second dose. Similarly, 126 and 35 healthcare workers were vaccinated with the first and second doses, respectively, and 809 and 122 frontline workers were given the first and second doses, respectively. The civil surgeon said elderly should come forward without hesitation and on-the-spot registration facility was available, for which they need to carry Aadhaar card and photo ID proof. She said even though the vaccine was being given, caution was still needed. She said people should wear masks, maintain social distance and wash hands.

The project will make way for a better infrastructure and boost demand for housing as commuting time is set to come down to less than an hour at present and eventually, 45 minutes, said real estate players. “The biggest advantage of the DME is the reduction in commute time from over two hours to just 45 minutes. It will also open up the market for home buyers who may be working in Delhi but want to stay in Meerut. The pandemic has created a need for more and more people to purchase their own homes. The fact that one can buy a home at a far lesser cost than Delhi-NCR and yet be in the capital city limits within 45 minutes’ drive time, will be a big boon for real estate development,” said Manish Aggarwal, managing director, North & East India, JLL India. “Road network is one of the key factors that helps in boosting the growth of real estate in any city. Infrastructure and road development makes way for good connectivity of a location, civic amenities and social infrastructure facilities such as schools, colleges, healthcare, entertainment, dedicated water, electricity supply and public gardens. Also, we have always observed that not only do people give preference to the project at such locations but the resale value of houses in such areas increases,” said Punit Agarwal, MD and CEO of Nirvana Realty. Rajendra Agarwal, BJP MP from Meerut, said, “The DME will bring development not only in Meerut but across west UP. This will boost investments in Meerut and NCR as more companies would like to open their offices and stores here.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/dme-to-push-up-housing-demand-in-ncr-say-realtors/articleshow/81856473.cms||Ishita Bhatia

Talking to the TOI, Singh said, “The UT administration was asked to focus on contact tracing of Covid patients and testing. Though UT is doing a good job, it was asked to put extra effort on ‘test-track-treat’ protocol.” The Centre’s team also visited different containment zones in the city. Recently, the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) had issued fresh guidelines and allowed UTs to impose local restrictions and strictly enforce the test-track-treat protocol. The ministry had said the states and UTs, where the proportion of RT-PCR tests was less, should rapidly increase it to reach the prescribed level of 70% or more.As per the new guidelines, all activities will continue to be permitted outside containment zones with standard operating procedures (SOPs).

---||Kochi||Kerala assembly polls: 12 agencies run election PR business worth Rs 75 crore||KOCHI: A road that borders Mar Ivanios College, Thiruvananthapuram, takes you to a couple of apartments where a group of nearly 50 young men from Karnataka is deeply involved in predicting the booth-level pulse of the 32 constituencies which the BJP is focusing this time around. They are part of Rajneethi Political Management Consultants, a Bengaluru-based firm contracted to help BJP analyse the electorates for them. It seems the Kerala election has provided a shot in the arm for the advertising and public relations businesses and also a whole new group of professionals called campaign strategists. “Between all the major political parties in the state, and their sympathizers, they are using the services of 12 professional agencies for this election. And their overall budget should touch Rs 75 crore. This is being spent on conducting the surveys, creative content production, public relations, event management and social media handling in Kerala,” said Dominic Savio, a leading image consultant and managing director, Buzzstop. When contacted, Sharaschandra Shankar Nag, founder of Rajneethi, dodged the questions on the activities they are doing for BJP in Kerala, but hinted that his firm is working in West Bengal, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu too. CPM-led Kerala government had selected a public relations firm Concept PR for taking the Kerala’s developmental narrative to the rest of the country. “Concept PR had already been engaged by the UP and Odisha governments in similar jobs and hence they won the contract. However, once the code of conduct kicked in, the public relations department was unable to use the services of the firm,” a source who is in the know said. “Congress is using Ahmedabad-based NPM-Niksun Political Media for its political campaigns,” said Savio. A call to Niksun’s office in Ahmedabad returned no response to the clarification sought by TOI on the topic. Chennithala’s statewide ‘yatra’ used three agencies for the campaign part – Impresario for event management, TVC Factory for film making and Buzzstop for creative content creation. Savio said that our elections have undergone a mammoth change. “Traditional methods have given way to many modern tools and techniques. Parties, fronts, and even individual politicians have invested in Artificial Intelligence-enabled mobile apps and people meters that integrate with every booth and every voter at the micro or macro levels. MIS (management information system) reports are being generated for every both on a daily basis that analyses age, sex, religion, caste and socio-economic class wise data,” he said.

He cited a TOI report published on December 4, 2020 saying that there was no environment impact assessment before sending a proposal for allotment of 148 hectare land for this project. He also submitted that laying down of pipelines for oil and gas would lead to environmental damage in future.After refuting government claims that steps are undertaken to protect Asiatic lions and the forest, the amicus curie urged the HC to stay the operation and implementation of these proposals. “If the abode of Asiatic lions is not protected, then there will be no more lions. The entire region is being eroded in a systematic manner. The chairman of the State Board for Wildlife who happens to be the chief minister had made a categorical statement that no part of Gir forest will be allotted for any development. But in the present case, what cannot be done directly is done indirectly. The area surround Gir is given to corporate houses and which will lead to destruction of the forest area,” amicus curie’s reply reads.The lawyer claimed that the railway line upgradation in reserved forest area, laying down of pipelines in eco-sensitive zone are being planned in view of the port and LNG terminal being constructed by a private company at Chhara in Gir Somnath district, which is 60 kilometre away from the reserved forest. This is for the benefit of the company which will be offloading the gas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/land-around-gir-being-given-to-corporate-houses-hc-told/articleshow/81859573.cms||---

The woman lost her baby boy after she delivered him on the road close to the PHC on March 29. Advocate BV Seshagiri Rao, who is also general secretary of Swaraj Abhiyan Telangana State, in his complaint on March 31 asked cops to investigate the alleged negligence of the PHC staff and book cases against them under the IPC section of causing death by negligence and other relevant sections of the law. Seshagiri Rao said he would also file a complaint before the Telangana State Human Rights Commission and the department of women and child development seeking an enquiry into the matter. He said the matter was of larger public interest and the authorities should issue further guidelines so that such instances do not recur. The woman was lying unattended with her dead boy near an open sewer and a video of the woman shot by a local had gone viral. The woman was later shifted to Gandhi Hospital for treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lawyer-files-complaint-seeks-action-against-erring-phc-staff/articleshow/81859526.cms||---

---||Goa||As Covid numbers rise, no washing of feet, shorter services on Maundy Thursday||MARGAO: This year, Maundy Thursday services at most churches did not include the traditional washing of the feet of the apostles as a preventive measure during the pandemic. Not part of the liturgy, the washing of the feet is a commemoration of what Jesus had done at the time. After Pope Francis washed the feet of prison inmates and Muslim migrants, some churches in Goa had also taken steps to make washing of the feet more inclusive and began washing the feet of women and even persons with disabilities. However, this year most churches avoided the tradition with several priests sharing prayers with families and asking them to enact the washing of the feet within their households. Similarly, Good Friday will see churches omitting all paraliturgical or devotional practices that are non-essential including the enactment of the passion of Christ, the kissing of the cross and processions and keep services as short as possible. No directives were sent from the archdiocese to churches but each parish priest is expected to act with prudence and strictly follow SOPs that were issued in the past. For the second consecutive year the Margao Monte will not hold the age-old tradition of enacting the crucifixion of Jesus and the bringing down of the life-sized statue from the cross. The procession to Holy Spirit Church, that followed, involving hundreds of faithful, has been suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic. “The situation doesn’t allow us to hold services the way we used to in the past. We have even tried to reduce the duration of the services keeping in mind the pandemic,” parish priest of Cansaulim’s St Thomas Church, Fr Jean da Cruz Fernandes, said. Several priests have decided to increase the number of Holy Week services as well as introduce services in chapels to cater to as many faithful as possible while following SOPs. At Mapusa, too, only simple services are being held at churches and chapels without the usual processions. Besides the St Jerome Church, services were held in all five chapels in Mapusa on Maundy Thursday. “On Good Friday too we will have two services at 6pm and 8pm and everything that is conducted in the church will also conducted at our chapels simultaneously to give those who cannot be accommodated at the church an opportunity to participate,” said parish priest of St Jerome Church, Fr Denis Fernandes. The church is also holding additional services on Saturday and Easter Sunday too. Initially, the Mapusa church had planned to organise the services on the large ground within its compound. As Holy Week usually draws large crowds from neighbouring villages, the open air setting was thought to be better. But after Section 144 was imposed, plans were reworked. “These are significant days and everybody wants to take part in these services,” Fernandes added. In Quepem no SOPs are being relaxed and overcrowding will not be permitted, parish priest Fr Jose Caetano D’Costa said. “We are spending a lot of money on sanitisation and other measures to protect our people. We are trying to keep services as short as possible as we don’t want people to suffer too much while wearing their masks. If there is any issue and if cases rise we may even think of stopping services. We are not stubborn about holding services and we are ready to help our people,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-covid-numbers-rise-no-washing-of-feet-shorter-services-on-maundy-thursday/articleshow/81862880.cms||Lisa Monteiro

This year, due to the pandemic, the varsity decided to review the academic performance of students based on the internal assignments. As the varsity could not hold pen and paper exams, it decided to assess them based on their internal assignment. Earlier, more than 3,000 external students at Gujarat University had not submitted their assignment papers, more than two months after the end of the November 21 deadline. The varsity then decided to complete the process by February 28. In all, there were about 13,000 external students for BA, BCom, MA, MCom studies. GU officials said they were investigating the issue. “Some candidates may have not uploaded their assignment files properly which could have led to submission errors,” said sources.

Murugadas Kutty, who is the son of astrologer (late) TMR Kutty and a palmist and astrologer from Palakkad, said that though Pinarayi Vijayan has ‘Kesariyogam’ (a time good things happen and he gets people’s support) as per his horoscope, he is affected by the curse of priests (Bhramanashapam). The grief caused to the royal family and women will not bode well for the chief minister, he added. He suggested that Vijayan should perform some pujas including ‘Neeranjanam’ (lighting sesame seed sachets in broken coconuts) for Lord Ayyappa and special pujas for Lord Ganesh after breaking coconuts. “I have earlier predicted that the current government will have to face issues involving women and it became true with Sabarimala issue. Pinarayi has ‘shreshta jathakam’ and ‘Kesariyogam’ and he is skilled and determined. He has high chances of winning the election but he is also facing the wrath of gods and the curse of brahmins. But, he can overcome them if he performs the prescribed pujas. It will minimize the impact,” Kutty said. Kutty, who claimed that he had predicted Modi government’s rule in India from 2014, said former chief minister Oommen Chandy’s fortunes have improved. “The conch shells and Kavadi say that he has no chovva drishti or apaharam from Shani or Rahu (the planetary positions of Mars and Saturn are ideal). Chandy’s image will be helpful for UDF,” he said. He said that he met several candidates of all parties and suggested solutions to overcome their present problems. He also said Jupiter favours the BJP and the party will perform better in elections. However, Kutty was not ready to make a clear cut prediction on who will rule Kerala after assembly elections. “I am not a member of any party and I don’t have affinity towards any party. As an astrologer I can speak about elections only astrologically. If I make a blunt prediction it might affect election. So I don’t want to do that,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/astrologer-proposes-remedial-pujas-for-cm/articleshow/81859612.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

As a result, the entire process will now begin afresh, said sources in the university. The decision was taken at a meeting of the search committee members on Thursday, according to sources. Earlier this year the University Grants Commission (UGC) had rejected the appointment of Rajendra Khimani, former registrar of Gujarat Vidyapith, as the new vice-chancellor of the varsity. The commission was of the view that his appointment was made without any representative of UGC in the search committee formed by Gujarat Vidyapith. Following this, UGC appointed Navin Sheth, vice-chancellor of Gujarat Technological University (GTU) as member of a search committee. The term of outgoing VC Anamik Shah was also extended till the new vice-chancellor is appointed and takes charge. Apart from Sheth, the four-member search committee includes members like Arvind Desai and professor Indira Hirve. Mahatma Gandhi was the first chancellor (kulpati) of the Vidyapith and he had held the office between 1920 and 1948. This time, because the university has adopted UGC qualifying conditions, the race for the post is expected to be narrower.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vc-search-panel-for-vidyapith-to-start-afresh/articleshow/81862833.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Govt begins RTE admission process early||Ahmedabad: The state education department has initiated the process of enrolling students under the Right to Education (RTE) Act early this year to ensure that maximum students can avail the benefits of the scheme, said sources in the education department. According to initial estimates, about 1.25 lakh students from the state are expected to enlist under the scheme. Many schools in the state refuse to enrol students under the RTE scheme once the admission processes in their schools are over. According to the Act, 25% of the total school admissions in Class 1 for underprivileged students. “Last year the process started in June-July due to the Covid-19 situation. However, a year before that, when things were normal the RTE process started around the same time. This year, the government has decided to put its house in order,” said a government official. The district education officers (DEOs) and district primary education officers (DPEOs) have been directed by the government to gather all relevant data of school admissions and submit them to INDEXT-B, said sources. The schools have to put information about tuition fees approved by the Fee Regulatory Commission (FRC) on INDEXT-B website, sources added. As many as 40,530 seats in Gujarat meant for candidates under the provisions of the Right to Education (RTE) Act were not given to such students in last two years. This was stated by the government in the state assembly in response to a question by a Congress MLA seeking data on RTE admissions in the state from 2019 to 2021. A total of 4,13,121 students were enrolled in Class 1 in the academic year 2019-20 in private schools across the state. Of these, 25% or 1,04,045 students were to be enrolled according to RTE Act. But the figures released by the education minister shows that 82,726 students only were enrolled, which means that 21,319 students under RTE Act did not get the opportunity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-begins-rte-admission-process-early/articleshow/81859656.cms||---

TPL, in its petition for the determination of tariff for 2021-22, had proposed to recover a cumulative revenue gap of Rs 29.93 crore (mainly arising out of past years’ under recoveries) by levying regulatory charge of 9 paise per unit from consumers in Surat. However, GERC in its tariff order for Surat supply area has not considered TPL’s proposals as the state power regulator estimated revenue surplus for the company. GERC on Thursday also issued tariff orders for Paschim Gujarat Vij Company Ltd (PGVCL), Madhya Gujarat Vij Company Ltd (MGVCL) and Dakshin Gujarat Vij Company Ltd (DGVCL). The state discoms had not sought any increase in tariffs during fiscal 2021-22. The issuance of tariff orders for Paschim Gujarat Vij Company Ltd (PGVCL) and TPL’s Ahmedabad supply area has been deferred due to the code of conduct in the wake of Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation elections, said sources privy to the information.

Pune divisional commissioner’s dashboard data showed that 347 ICU beds and over 140 ICU beds with ventilator support were available in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) on Thursday afternoon. The ICU bed availability in the PMC limits was just six. “The team at every hospital will work in two shifts to check if beds are being made available for Covid-19 treatment as per the 80:20 formula. We expect frequent bed data updates on the dashboard after the appointment of the teams,” a PMC health official said. Additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agarwal said ventilator supported beds were available but there was constant inflow of patients. “Seven ventilator supported beds will be made available at the Baner Covid facility and another eight will be added at Dalvi hospital in the next few days. More ventilators are also being provided at the Sassoon General Hospital. Similar facility will be made available at the Army hospital in the next few days.” The PMC on Thursday held a meeting of private hospitals, in which they were told to release beds at the earliest. An official who was part of the meeting said the beds were expected to be provided in phases within the next week. Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol said steps were being taken to ensure that citizens do not face any hardships while getting information pertaining to bed availability. Private hospitals had been told to release the beds at the earliest for Covid treatment, he added. Rao seeks allocation similar to Oct 2020 Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao has directed all the private hospitals in PMC limits to ensure bed availability similar to October last year. He said there were 2,134 beds available for Covid treatment on October 13 last year. “I have directed the private hospitals to ensure bed availability similar to October last year by April 6. If they cannot manage it, the administration will take over the management too,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-appoints-teams-at-23-hospitals-to-monitor-bed-management-update-dashboard/articleshow/81859697.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Kochi||Kerala assembly elections: Devikulam goes to poll Tamil-style||IDUKKI: The style of campaigning in the Devikulam constituency, bordering Tamil Nadu, has a Kollywood-style to it. Popular Tamil film songs are played on loudspeakers to attract the Tamil community in the constituency. Besides, posters, announcements and even speeches are in Tamil. Devikulam has a significant number of Tamil voters and that isn't surprising considering over 90% of the plantation workers in the constituency are of Tamil origin. Of the 11 panchayats in the Devikulam constituency, at least eight have a majority Tamil-speaking population. Naturally, when it came to candidates, the choices made by all three fronts were keeping in mind the Tamil-speaking population. A Raja, nominee of LDF, D Kumar representing the UDF, and S Ganeshan, an independent backed by the NDA are members of the Tamil community in the constituency. Ganeshan reportedly received the support of NDA after AIADMK candidate Dhanalakshmi Marimuthu's nomination was rejected. According to Adimalai block panchayat member K Krishnamurthy, the candidates choose the appropriate language -- Tamil or Malayalam -- depending on the localities they are campaigning in. “Candidates prefer Tamil while campaigning in Marayoor, Kanthaloor, Devikulam, Munnar, Chinnakkanal, Edamalakkduy, and Pallivasal panchayats," said Krishnamurthy. While seeking votes in Bisonvalley, Mankulam, Adimali, and Vellathooval, they switch to Malayalam, Krishnamurthy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/devikulam-goes-to-poll-tamil-style/articleshow/81859666.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Delhi||3,594 cases, 14 deaths: Covid on steep curve||New Delhi: The capital recorded 3,594 fresh Covid cases on Friday — the highest daily count this year— while 14 more people died due to the infection, taking the death toll to 11,050. The positivity rate mounted to 4.11% from 3.57% on Thursday when the number of cases stood at 2,790. On Wednesday, 1,819 cases were reported with a positivity rate of 2.71%. The number of cumulative cases on Friday stood at 6,68,814. Over 6.45 lakh patients have recovered from the virus. The city recorded 992 cases on Tuesday, 1,904 cases on Monday and 1,881 cases on Sunday. It saw 1,558 cases on Saturday, 1,534 last Friday, 1,515 cases last Thursday, 1,254 on Wednesday and 1,101 cases last Tuesday, when it had crossed the 1,000-mark for the first time since December 24. The 3,594 cases are the highest single-day tally since December 4, when the city recorded 4,067 cases in a day. With this, the number of active cases shot to 11,994 from 10,498 on Thursday. A total of 87,505 tests, including 54,898 RT-PCR and 32,607 rapid antigen tests, were conducted in the past 24 hours, officials in the state health department said. A month ago, Delhi was recording 130-140 cases daily. However, in the past week, the daily tally has increased over 10 times. “It is too early to say whether the symptoms are serious in the current wave compared with the previous one. However, the rise in cases and demand for hospital beds have been sudden this time. If it continues to increase at the same pace, we may soon run out of beds,” said a senior doctor. Dr Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS, told TOI on Thursday that presence of mutated strains of the virus that causes Covid-19, mostly the UK one which has high transmissibility, has been a crucial factor behind the sudden surge. However, lack of Covid-appropriate behaviour — wearing masks in public places, social distancing and washing hands regularly — was the main reason, he added. “People have developed a fatigue to the situation. They want to go out, party and travel despite the surge in cases. One of the reasons behind this is that this time around, young people are more affected and the severity of symptoms among them are lesser. However, we must realise that, eventually, the youth may spread the infection to elderly and those with comorbidities and we might witness overwhelming healthcare infrastructure again,” Dr Guleria said. Dr Suneela Garg, another public health expert, stressed on the need to test aggressively and take steps to contain disease spread in areas where there are fewer cases at present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3594-cases-14-deaths-covid-on-steep-curve/articleshow/81878132.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||UDF offers spirited fight in Left bastions in Kollam||Kollam: As the election is just five days ahead, the four constituencies on the eastern part of the district, touted to be Left bastions, are witnessing a spirited fight. However, the electorate here are giving hints that political convictions will ultimately prevail over propaganda and the smartness of the candidates and efficacy of the campaign alone would not prompt them to change their preferences. While the constituencies of Kottarakkara and Pathanapuram have shifted favours giving weightage to the candidates time to time, Chadayamangalam and Punalur have always been known for its Left leanings. P Aisha Potty of the CPM rewrote history by emerging as the giant killer by defeating R Balakrishna Pillai in 2006. Kottarakkara tilted further towards the Left when Pillai’s KC (B) joined the LDF in 2016. Along with it, Pathanapuram from where Pillai’s son K B Ganesh Kumar was getting elected for the last four consecutive terms, also joined the Left fold. It was against this backdrop that the UDF fielded new faces like M M Nazeer from Chadayamangalam against CPI’s central committee member J Chinchurani and Congress‘s R Resmi from Kottarakakra against CPM candidate K N Balagopal, Jyothikuamr Chamakkala against K B Ganesh Kumar and Abdul Rehman Randathani of the IUML against P S Supal of the CPI at Punalur. Probably for the first time since Ganesh Kumar started the triumphant journey 20 years ago, Pathanapuram is witnessing a spirited fight with Jyothikumar trying to make inroads. However, Kumar questions the very logic of criticism against his work on the development front. “Anywhere you go in my constituency, within a distance of 250 meters you can see at least one development project I have brought in,” a confident Kumar says. Chamakkala is pointing out that the incumbent MLA could not set up a taluk headquarters hospital as promised in his 2016 manifesto. But Kuamr counters this with showing the GO sanctioning Rs 74.80 crore from the KIIFB fund for the project. BJP’s Jithin Dev is also actively campaigning to increase the NDA vote share. Chadayamangalam, a Left bastion, has tilted towards the UDF only once when Prayaar Gopalakrishnan got elected in 2001. But since 2006 Mullakkara Ratnakaran had been winning from here consecutively for three terms. UDF candidate M M Nazeer is promising the formation of a taluk with Chadayamangalam as its headquarters. “This time people will vote for a change. The rift in the CPI and the hurt sentiments of the devotees of Lord Ayyappa would come to one head against the LDF,” he hopes. However, there are not many takers to the UDF’s claim of winning the seat. “There may be rift in the CPI over the denial of seat to A Musthafa, the popular local leader. But it is unlikely to unsettle the LDF here,” Abdul Kareem, who runs a public distribution shop under Supplyco in Chadayamangalam town said. BJP’s Vishnu Pattathanam has been able to put up a good fight here. “There are chances for BJP to emerge as the runner up here,” G Hari, a former district functionary of the BJP, exudes confidence. In Punalur, CPI’s P S Supal, who represented the constituency twice from 1996 to 2006, has already made a perceptible sway over the voters making the fight difficult to Randathani. Ayoor Murali is the NDA candidate here. In Kottarakakra, UDF’s R Resmi is giving a vigorous fight to CPM strong man K N Balagopal. BJP’s Vayakkal Soman is also eyeing to bring the votes share above 40,000 this time. The efficacy of the campaign and smartness of the candidates will determine their fate this time as all the three main contestants belong to the same community. Balagopal, a former Rajya Sabha member and former district secretary of the CPM, has close connect with the people here. But Resmi, who was elected to the district panchayat twice from Kulakkda division with a huge margin has already struck a chord with the people. “I am connected to the ordinary people. I am confident of the victory as voters cutting across party lines will vote for me,” she claims.

Based on the girl’s complaint, police booked the accused and later detained them. In her complaint, the girl alleged that she was abducted by three persons — including two identified accused — when she had gone to relieve herself around 2 pm on March 29, said police. She alleged that one of the identified accused covered her mouth and nose with a piece of cloth and soon she passed out. “Upon regaining, I found myself at another identified accused’s sister house,” claimed the girl. The girl alleged that she was raped by the three accused that night. When she started crying and screaming for help, they gagged her with a piece of cloth and dropped her at her village the next day, said the complainant, adding that upon reaching home, she narrated her ordeal to her parents. Interacting with the media, the girl claimed that she had informed police about the crime the last day, but they did not take any action. “Also, police threatened to arrest me along with my father and brother if I spoke against the accused,” alleged the girl. Thereafter, on Thursday, she approached Hathras superintendent of police Vineet Jaiswal, who assured her of all help, said the girl. Talking to TOI, the SP said an FIR was registered under section 376 D (gang rape) and other relevant sections of the IPC, SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act against the accused. “The accused have been detained for the questioning and further investigations are on.” The SP said that though the girl had given her statement to the police the last day, she had not mentioned that she was raped. In her statement, which was videoed, she stated that she went to Agra after her mother scolded her, but returned home as she started missing her family. The girl had also stated that “she did not want to lodge an FIR”.

---||Agra||POCSO court awards death to youth, 22, for raping, assaulting 10-year-old||AGRA: In a span of three and a half months since the crime was committed, a POCSO court in Firozabad district on Thursday awarded death sentence to a 22-year-old youth for raping and assaulting a 10-year-old who called him, “Chacha”. The child was left in a field to bleed to death. Her parents found her in time to shift her to hospital, where she has undergone three major surgeries. In the meantime, under the direct supervision of SSP, Firozabad, Ajay Kumar, the culprit was arrested within 48 hours and police filed the chargesheet in court within a month. The crime was committed on December 14 and additional sessions judge Mridul Dubey pronounced the judgment on Thursday, within three and a half months of the crime. Sentencing the man to death, judge Dubey said the rape was committed in a “brutal and barbaric manner”. “The rape of a minor girl child is nothing but a monstrous burial of her dignity in darkness. It is a crime against the holy body of a girl child and the soul of society, and such a crime is aggravated by the manner in which it has been committed. The crime speaks of depravity, degradation and uncommonality. It is diabolical and barbaric.” The judge added, “The appalling cruelty shown by the accused to the minor is extremely shocking and it gets accentuated when her age is taken into consideration. It was not committed under any mental stress or emotional disturbance and it is difficult to comprehend that he would not commit such acts and would be reformed and rehabilitated. He would remain a menace in society, for a defenceless child has become his prey. So, in my opinion, there is no mitigating circumstances, and the accused should always be kept away from society.” Special public prosecutor Ajmod Kumar Chauhan said, “It is a big relief that justice has been delivered in less than four months. It was a very disturbing case. The accused had crossed the limits of brutality. She has undergone three major operations so far. Unfortunately, she will never be able to live a normal life.” SSP Ajay Kumar said, “Following the hard work of police team and strong prosecution, we managed to get justice for the child in less than four months. We had collected foolproof evidence against the accused. DNA reports were also enclosed with the chargesheet. We welcome the court’s decision to award capital punishment to the accused. People involved in crime against women and children will have to face most severe punishment.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/pocso-court-awards-death-to-youth-22-for-raping-assaulting-10-year-old/articleshow/81856582.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Goa||From churches to homes, rituals take on new meaning||PANAJI: Old Goa’s Se parish, did things differently this Maundy Thursday by asking the faithful to cleanse their own family members’ feet at home. As advised by parish priest Fr Alfred Vaz to observe the practice in the safe confines of their home, a few did conduct the rite of re-enacting Jesus’ expression of loving humility to each other. “When we perform this rite in our homes, then it will have still more significance, as we will experience the sacrifice of Jesus with even deeper understanding,’ Vaz said in an appeal circulated to parishioners. The members of the family should gather in a circle near the altar with lit candles, after duly placing a vessel for washing feet, some water, a towel, petals of flowers and the Holy Bible. The details about the protocol to be observed covered hymns and prayers to be recited. The recitation of the introductory words seek to remind the faithful about the significance of the Last Supper in serving others. For the laity accustomed to seeing the priest washing the feet, the more active role was a unique spiritual experience. “It was very touching experience to wash the feet of our family members. We had done it last year when churches were closed,” Marcelina Pereira, a parishioner, said. If there is some discord between family members, let it be wiped away with the washing of the feet, the parish priest’s appeal stated. “Yes, it does help bonding between family members,” Pereira said. “Every year, we see the priest washing the people’s feet and this is an expression of humility and willingness to serve others,” Vaz said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/from-churches-to-homes-rituals-take-on-new-meaning/articleshow/81862919.cms||Paul Fernandes

According to a report released by NGOs monitoring political parties in the country, 38% candidates contesting in the state assembly elections have criminal cases against them. In absolute numbers, out of the 928 candidates analysed, 355 candidates have declared criminal cases against them. Of these, 167 have serious criminal cases registered against them. In 2016, 138 candidates had declared serious criminal cases against themselves. At a press conference held online on Thursday, the Association for Democratic Reforms & National Election Watch said 75 out of 140 constituencies are red alert constituencies. Red alert constituencies are those where three or more contesting candidates have declared criminal cases against them. BJP leaders are leading the list and the candidates themselves have stated that the cases are politically motivated, and have been foisted on them. Leading from the front is BJP state president K Surendran, who has 248 criminal cases against him. K S Radhakrishnan, BJP’s candidate from Tripunithura, has 211 criminal cases against him while AN Radhakrishnan, also of BJP, who has been fielded in Manalur constituency, has 176 criminal cases against him.

The Supreme Court, in its directions issued on February 13, 2020, had specifically instructed political parties to give reasons for selecting such candidates and had asked why individuals without criminal antecedents could not be selected as candidates. As per these mandatory guidelines, candidate selection has to be with reference to qualifications, achievements and merit of the candidate concerned.

---||Mumbai||BMC lists warning signs for home isolation patients in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Considering the increase in Covid-19 cases in Mumbai, BMC on Wednesday issued revised guidelines for home isolation of patients. It also listed out specific warning signs to watch out for immediate hospital transfer of patients under home isolation. BMC has also asked its officers to ensure that home-isolated patients monitor their health and take treatment for the infection from their family physician and continue their regular treatment for comorbidities, if any. The list of warning signs that would need hospital admission includes difficulty in breathing, oxygen saturation below 95% on fingertip pulse oximeter, a persistent fever of 100.4 or higher for more than 24 hours, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, cough, hypoxic on mild exertion such as a six-minute walk test and climbing one or two flights of stairs, mental confusion or inability to wake up, slurred speech, seizures, weakness or numbness in any limb or face, bluish discolouration of lips or face, signs of onset of any organ dysfunction such as hypotension, drowsiness and kidney dysfunction. BMC has also said home-isolated patients should restrict their movement within their residence too. They also should regularly inform their health status to the tele-monitoring team, medical officer, family doctor or BMC officers who have been asked to note down the names of the physician. A dedicated team of civic staff must do a random check of 10% of patients daily to find whether he or she is violating home isolation rules. A medical officer from a civic ward said the revised guidelines circular goes beyond reiterating what was being followed so far to include specific warning signs to watch out for in asymptomatic or mildly symptomtic patients. “Patients receive an IVR call daily and are required to respond to the call as it is from BMC and for the patient’s own benefit. In view of the rising cases, we cannot afford to miss out on looking out for warning signs in patients. If these are not addressed on time, the patient’s condition could deteriorate,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-lists-warning-signs-for-home-isolation-patients-in-mumbai/articleshow/81864322.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Kochi||SEAC sets new ‘norm’ for giving EC||Thiruvananthapuram: The state expert appraisal committee (SEAC), which has put forward compensatory afforestation and traffic management plan as prerequisite conditions for granting environmental clearance (EC) for highrise projects, has now mandated river rejuvenation as another condition for getting EC to a realty project. While considering an application for EC for a residential building project at Sasthamangalam village, SEAC has directed the proponent to submit actual details and plans for Killi river rejuvenation with actions and cost component for each and year-wise breakup. This was decided in a meeting that discussed the field inspection report. The condition on Killi river rejuvenation was included along with 10 other criteria, which also included in the detailed compensatory green belt development plan for cutting 117 trees. In addition to this, plan has to be submitted for planting one tree sapling for each 80sq m area with local tree species, covering a total of 66 trees. The committee has also sought the highest flood level (HFL) data of Killi river near the project. Clean Killiyaar Mission (CKM) had received a special mention in the finance minister’s budget speech. Around 30,000 volunteers had taken part in the cleaning mission of Nedumangadu, covering a distance of 22km starting from Karinjathi to Vazhayila bridge in 2020. The second phase of CKM by the city corporation had begun at Killippalam in December 2019 as part of Haritha Keralam Mission’s project ‘Ini Njan Ozhukatte’. The third phase involves preparation of detailed project report for construction of side banks, green spaces and the like. The SEAC has recently mandated Miyawaki forest as one of the conditions recommended for the issuance of EC for the proposed expansion of the mixed land use by Dragonstone Realty at Technopark phase-III campus. One of the conditions was that compensatory afforestation/Miyawaki forest may be developed within the first two years of the project. SEAC observed in its meeting held in December 2020 that accommodating one tree for every 80sq m may not be possible to be implemented on the lease area. So, along with the green belt development, an additional area outside may be selected for raising a green belt or Miyawaki forest, according to the minutes of the meeting. The authority had also put forward traffic regulation plan as one of the six conditions for granting EC for a proposed commercial complex comprising hotel, convention centre and shopping mall in the city. Traffic regulation plan was demanded by SEAC along with plans for stormwater management, water supply service, disaster management, rain water collection and condition on treated water discharge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/seac-sets-new-norm-for-giving-ec/articleshow/81856590.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Incumbent VC M K Surappa completes his tenure on April 11. The committee will shortlist three names to submit to governor Banwarilal Purohit. Professor Kumar also headed the VC search committee of Madras university last year. Political parties in Tamil Nadu had opposed his appointment to Madras university committee stating that his tenure at JNU was mired in controversies. The Anna University search panel will also comprise Madras university former VC S P Thyagarajan and former IAS officer Sheela Rani Chungath. Professor Thyagarajan was the nominee of the Syndicate while Sheela Rani Chungath was nominated by the state government. “The search panel may meet once before inviting the applications for the VC post. The first meeting is likely to be held online,” a source said. Due to the model code of conduct for assembly elections, the formation of a search committee was delayed. The government issued an order only after the Election Commission’s consent. “Even before issuing the advertisement for the post, the panel may need consent from the Election Commission. So, the selection process is likely to start after the elections on April 6,” a professor from Anna University said. As per the amendment to Tamil Nadu University Laws, the search panel will have four months to submit the three names to the governor. The government formed an inquiry committee, headed by a retired high court judge P Kalaiyarasan, to probe the allegations of financial irregularities against VC Surappa. Professor Surappa has filed a case challenging the government order constituting the commission of inquiry against him and it is pending before the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/jnu-vc-jagadesh-kumar-to-head-anna-university-vc-search-panel/articleshow/81859922.cms||A Ragu Raman

Calling it the “ikrarnama” ( oath) the Social Reforms Committee of AIMPLB wants this to be read out before the Friday prayers at mosques and sermons be held calling upon community members to take a pledge to abide by these guidelines. All India convenor of Social Reform Committee of AIMPLB, Muhammad Umrain Mahfooz, shared that while this campaign has been on since March in different states, a decision was taken to scale up the outreach to the national level.  He also shared that long term plans include setting up committees in mosques with people who can reach out to families where there is a marriage and ask them to keep it simple. Also counselling facilities to resolve marital disputes are proposed. Mahfooz shared that in Islam dowry is not allowed and incidents of extravagant marriages and cases of girls facing difficulties after marriages due to demand for dowry were worrying. “Hence we felt that these guidelines are necessary,” he added. The 11 points include vows like calling upon families and to be married couples to stop the ritual of “baarat” (the arrival of Groom at the wedding venue with lavish procession) and to organize nikah with simplicity in Masjids. It is also sought that families will refrain from fireworks, music/DJ, videography and other needless activities. The AIMPLB states that first attempts to educate and inform must be made in cases where one learns of demand for dowry or ostentatious wedding plans but if people still do not pay heed “then such marriage ceremonies should be openly disapproved as it is important to call out what is wrong”. AIMPLB also plans to organise workshops for the young boys and girls who are going to marry shortly or who have recently married. “A training course would be formulated by the Board in which they would be informed about the Islamic guidance with regards to married life,” it is stated in a resolution adopted by the Board. “A “iqrarnama” (oath) should be framed in which the youth and their guardians pledge themselves for conducting marriages according to the Sunnah and the Shari’ah. This oath must be sent to all the mosques and should be read out before the congregation who pledge themselves to it,” AIMPLB has stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/shun-dowry-lavish-weddings-aimplb-starts-11-point-campaign/articleshow/81865787.cms||Ambika Pandit

Out of the Rs 32 crore target set by the civic body, Rs 28 crore was recovered since the division of municipal corporations. JMC-Greater, however, managed to cross their Rs 42-crore target. The revenue collection includes urban development tax, hoarding tax, marriage garden license fees and dairy booths charge. Both the municipal corporations are dealing with financial crisis this year as revenue collection has been low over the years and both are yet to collect more than Rs 600 of urban development tax. Both the corporations have outsourced the urban development tax collection to a private company, but even then the total amount collected for JMC-Heritage is low. A senior officer at JMC-Heritage said, “Apart from the pandemic impact, the number of commercial properties in JMC-Heritage areas is pretty low as compared to Greater. In Greater, the number of marriage gardens is around 600, but in Heritage only 100 gardens are there. Obviously, the revenue of the Heritage will be lower and in future it will have a difficult impact.” The JMC-Greater has been able to collect good revenue from marriage gardens, urban development tax and from dairy booth. The number of commercial properties in Greater are also higher than Heritage and with more addition every year, it is expected to increase. JMC-Heritage officials said aid from the government will be necessary for keep them floating in upcoming years. “Like JMC-Greater, we will be implementing trade license from which we will be able to generate revenue from private coaching centres, shops and tobacco sellers. That is the only saving grace for us,” said a Heritage official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jmc-heritage-falls-short-of-revenue-collection-target/articleshow/81859942.cms||---

Majority of those aged 45 and above fall in the category of people who have a lot of family responsibility such as teenaged children and elderly parents and therefore want their daily bread devoid fear. “It is the shield, which I wanted to have for a long time. I have been teaching in a school by adhering to all Covid norms. Now, with the government allowing people above 45 years to get the vaccine, I took it as an opportunity and got the jab on the first day. The vaccine gives me more confidence, but I will continue following Covid guidelines such as wearing masks and maintaining social distancing,” said Vijay Sharma, teacher at a government school in Shastri Nagar area. An ACB constable also rushed to a vaccination centres to get the shot. “We take action against corrupt people. While on job, our life has changed as we have to maintain social distance and also wear face masks. It is our duty to cooperate with the government and to get the jab to fight against Covid,” said Manohar Lal, a 52-year-old constable at ACB. Priti Katta, who is working in the insurance sector said, “I have come with my husband for vaccination. We have two children who are in their twenties. When government allows them to get the vaccine, we will get vaccinated,” said Katta, a 46-year-old resident of Bani Park. Vinod Kumar Singh and his wife Sushma also got the jab. “Four of our family members including us got infected with the virus in November. But, it was mild infection. We recovered while staying under home quarantine. Vaccines will give us protection now,” said Singh. Nodal officer (Covid-19 vaccination) at a government hospital, Dr Ashok Khandelwal said, “Till afternoon, more than 120 people got the jab, which is a good response.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/now-shot-in-the-arm-for-people-above-45-years/articleshow/81859997.cms||---

---||---||Tamil Nadu assembly election: Quick cash at rallies is more enticing than Covid shot||CHENNAI: Fewer people are walking in for their vaccinations in Chennai over the last few days. A senior corporation official blamed this dip on people taking part in election activities. Data from Greater Chennai Corporation shows that daily vaccination figures have dropped by at least 10,000 to 15,000. Despite having no vaccine hesitancy, people, primarily from low-income group homes, are skipping the shot due to election activities, the official said. Such residents are lured by political parties to take part in rallies, for which they are paid Rs 500 in addition to getting free food and a bottle of petrol, the official said based on his interactions with many residents. If they participate in more than one rally a day, they could earn Rs 1,000. After one is administered the vaccine, symptoms of fever, fatigue and body pain may persist for a day or two. This would render people incapable of attending rallies and hence they want to postpone the shot, the official said. “As cases are spreading across the city, we are looking to vaccinate as many people as possible. But in low income group areas, we face this issue,” the official said.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); About 10 days ago, Greater Chennai Corporation reached a high of around 35,000 vaccinations. Ever since, it had consistently been vaccinating more than 30,000 people daily. However, numbers have dropped in the last few days. As on date, around 7.5 lakh people in the city have been vaccinated. “The numbers will go up after polling activity is over,” the official said. Widespread vaccination is the most important strategy to ensure that we control the city’s Covid surge, corporation commissioner G Prakash said. The corporation, at present, provides free vaccination service in 140 urban primary health centres and 16 secondary health centres. People can also get their shots at 175 private hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/tamil-nadu/quick-cash-at-rallies-is-more-enticing-than-covid-shot/articleshow/81860014.cms||Siddharth Prabhakar
---||Delhi||Hospitals bring manpower back for Covid duty||New Delhi: The spike in Covid-19 cases in Delhi has increased the burden on public and private hospitals, both of which are flooded with requests for admissions. On Friday, data shared by the hospitals on Delhi Corona app shows, 2,250 (38%) of the 5,899 beds reserved for Covid-19 patients were occupied. The occupancy of Covid ICU beds with and without ventilators stood at 46% and 37%, respectively. Dr Rajesh Malhotra, chief, AIIMS Trauma Centre, told TOI that they currently have over 100 Covid patients admitted to the centre. “There has been a sudden increase in demand for Covid-19 beds. Some of our staff, which were diverted to non-Covid areas earlier, are being brought back on Covid duty,” he added. At Lok Nayak Hospital, the authorities said they have 300 beds reserved for Covid patients, and if the demand increases, they would add more. “We have created a system where 25% of the staff from all the specialties are diverted for Covid duty on a rotational basis,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of the hospital. At least eight leading private hospitals said they did not have any beds left for Covid patients. Max Shalimar Bagh has 95 reserved beds, and at 9pm on Friday, all of them were occupied. Similar situation was witnessed at Manipal Hospital in Dwarka, Maharaja Agrasen Hospital in Punjabi Bagh, Kalra Hospital in Kirti Nagar, National Heart Institute in East of Kailash, Metro Hospital in Preet Vihar and Malik Radix Hospital in Nirman Vihar, which have 60, 45, 25, 25, 21 and 19 Covid beds, respectively. Apollo Hospital has 108 Covid beds, of which 67 were occupied. “The crisis can be averted if people follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. We are staring at another full-blown crisis,” said Dr Anupam Sibal, group medical director of Apollo Hospital. He added that they have dedicated staff for Covid duty. “We have learnt a lot on how to treat an infected individual. However, the fact remains that, if the system gets overwhelmed, it does have an effect on healthcare workers, who have to work for long hours with PPEs on,” Dr Sibal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hospitals-bring-manpower-back-for-covid-duty/articleshow/81878151.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Compared to prior online registrations, those walking in can register on the spot by producing ID proof, including PAN or Aadhaar details. Surgeon Shailesh Puntambekar, medical director of Galaxy Care hospital said, "Walk-in vaccinations were up at our hospital. Of the 380 who got the shots, 197 were walk-ins."Bharati hospital too, which has had mainly online registrations, recorded a high number of walk-ins on Thursday. Jitendra Oswal, Bharati's medical director, said, "We vaccinated a total of 330 citizens on Thursday. Of them, 310 simply walked in and got the shots after fulfilling formalities of payment and on-the-spot registration. Till Wednesday (March 31), we had mainly recorded online registrations."Oswal, however, said advanced online registration makes the vaccine process smooth.He said, "Online registration gives us an idea of the day's expected number of beneficiaries. We can mobilize manpower accordingly to ensure smooth vaccination. But that does not mean we don't get walk-ins. If we were getting 400 daily online bookings in the past, another 200 were walk-ins. But going by Thursday's figures, the trend is going to change in favour of walk-in vaccinations."Vijay Agarwal, medical administrator of Joshi hospital, said, "The ratio of walk-in vaccination to vaccination after prior registration is 60:40 at our hospital."Officials, however, pointed out that earlier private hospitals would see more prior registrations and government units would see more walk-ins. "But this trend seems to have undergone a change after April 1, as private hospitals are also recording more walk-in vaccinations due to the expanded vaccination programme. The next few days' figures will consolidate this trend," the PMC's immunization officer, Vaishali Jadhav, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vaccine-sites-record-surge-in-walk-ins/articleshow/81860018.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The civic body had applied for Rs 500-crore loan to meet with its requirements. HUDCO regional head Sudhir Bhatnagar came to JMC-Heritage headquarters and handed over the cheque to mayor Munesh Gurjar. Gurjar said, “Our priority is to start the works related to gardens, sewerage lines and drainage system. For now, we have availed only Rs 200 crore as we want to utilise the funds in a systematic way. If we had taken the entire amount in one go, the interest would have been higher. We decided our priority on spending the amount.” There is a liability of over Rs 200 crore on JMC, Heritage including unpaid bills of contractors. The civic work contractors were on strike in both Heritage and Greater for more than six months. JMC, Heritage somehow cajoled the contractors by agreeing to pay a minimum Rs 25 lakh to each and resumed the civic work. The contractors, however, are still on strike in Greater. Sudhir Bhatnagar, regional head, HUDCO, said the development proposal given by JMC, Heritage was as per National Green Tribunal’s guidelines. “We have approved the loan and development work will soon start in the city. In the first two years, only interest on the Rs 200 crore loan will be paid by JMC, Heritage and after that loan re-payment will start on quarterly basis,” said Bhatnagar. Loan for similar amount was applied by JMC, Greater as well and they have sanctioned Rs 300 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/heritage-gets-rs-200-crore-as-first-installment-from-hudco/articleshow/81860015.cms||---

While the man’s body was found hanging from the ceiling fan, those of his wife and two children, aged six and three years, were found in the room on the second floor of their three-storied house. Police recovered a one-page suicide note from the room, in which the man requested his parents be taken care of. The preliminary enquiry appears to show that Dheeraj Yadav, 31, first killed his wife and children and then hanged himself. Pranav Tayal, DCP (Rohini) said, “The deceased have been identified as Dheeraj Yadav, his wife Aarti, 28, and their two sons, Hiten, 6, and Atharva, 3. Dheeraj was employed by Delhi Transport Corporation as a bus driver.” A case of murder has been registered. The post-mortem of the bodies was carried out during the day and the cops are awaiting the report. The bodies were first discovered by Maha Singh, 72, Yadav’s father who had gone to wake him up at 5am. Singh was earlier a havaldar in the Indian Army. The upset septuagenarian said his son had returned home on Wednesday around 2pm and grumbled about being late and not being able to attend his duty. He then asked his father to wake him up early so he could get ready for the morning shift. On Thursday, the old man kept knocking on the door without getting a response, he said. “Usually, he opens the door at one go, but when he did not respond to my repeated knocks, I pulled the wheat drum and climbed on it to peer through the window vent,” said Singh. “I could not believe what my eyes saw. His body was hanging from the fan. I rushed downstairs to alert my elder son and informed the cops.” Apparently, Yadav’s older son had speech impediments and could pronounce only a few words, such as mummy, papa and dadu. The younger son had a limb disability issues and had to be lifted and physically moved from place to place. The distraught father said, “My mother is 100 years old and doesn’t get much sleep. She wakes up at odd hours. My wife is mentally disturbed and has to be confined to one room to ensure that she does not wander out.” Singh's elder son, Neeraj, works as an operating theatre assistant in BSA Hospital, while his wife, Jyoti, is a teacher. The couple live on the first floor with their two children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-kills-wife-2-kids-hangs-self/articleshow/81860024.cms||Sakshi Chand

Omkar Group’s three projects’ accounts turned NPA, including the Yes Bank loan on Worli project.In their statement to the ED, Omkar Group promoters claimed that they clubbed their Wadala SRA project with the Worli project with the bank’s knowledge as it was permitted under SRA rules and there was no diversion of funds. The Omkar Group told ED they paid Joshi to seek his help for the Wadala project.The ED chargesheet includes the statement of Sanjay Sethi, compliance consultant of the Sachin Joshi-promoted Viiking Group. Sethi denied providing any services to Omkar Group for the Wadala project after stating that Viiking Group is not into SRA-related work. At the same time, Joshi claimed he received part of the money for allowing Omkar Group to use his brand name (actor Sachin Joshi) for the Wadala project and part of the money was an investment in his company to execute a project jointly in Pune.The ED registered a money laundering case against Omkar Group on the basis of an FIR in Aurangabad district. The complainant in the case is Aurangabad-based businessman Mahendra Surana who had invested in the Wadala project. Surana had filed a cheating case against Omkar Group and its senior office-bearers in March 2020. Afterwards, police closed the investigation. Omkar Group challenged the ED action before Bombay high court, stating that police had already closed the case against them. The court said ED’s money laundering case stands on its own and thereafter does not require support of predicate (schedule) offence.The ED can register a money laundering case against a person/firm only if the person/firm has been booked in any predicate offence by the police, CBI or any other agency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/omkar-groups-promoters-and-actor-named-in-ed-chargesheet-in-mumbai/articleshow/81863114.cms||Vijay V Singh

It comes a day before CM Uddhav Thackeray’s review meeting on Friday, where a decision on further restrictions on public movement and other possible curbs like shutting down high footfall places like malls, cinema halls, religious places is likely to be announced.Maharashtra added 43,183 cases and 249 deaths, the fatalities being the highest since November 5 (256). This is also the second day in a row that the state has added over 200 deaths. The state’s total caseload rose to 28.5 lakh and deaths to 54,898.Mumbai added 8,646 cases, a significant jump from its previous high of 6,933 cases reported on March 28. The city also reported 18 deaths, the highest in nearly four months since December 5 when 19 deaths were reported.The rise in deaths comes even as authorities have been saying that though cases have been surging, most have been mild or asymptomatic and deaths had remained low. Dr T P Lahane, head of the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), said rising deaths is a cause for worry but it’s still not alarming when seen from the perspective of case fatality rate. “We are no doubt adding more deaths but we are in a better situation than September when there were 5 lakh cases but over 12,000 deaths,” he said. Barring Latur, Aurangabad, and to some extent Pune, hospital beds are available in most parts. “People simply need to see a doctor on time and not ignore their symptoms,” he added.Mumbai’s total case tally touched 4.2 lakh and deaths 11,708 on Thursday. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region’s (MMR) total case tally crossed 9 lakh.Members of the Covid task force attributed the rise in cases to more tests and data transparency. Civic officials said as many as 46,758 tests were carried out on Thursday, the second highest in recent times.Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar warned strict lockdown measures are expected soon. These could include travel restrictions on local trains. “In the new restrictions that might be announced soon, malls and religious places may be shut, and shops may be asked to open on alternate days. The state government might restrict local train use to essential workers only.”The MMR continued to add the highest cases in the state (14,786) and the Nagpur region recorded 64 deaths, the highest in the state. Thane city recorded the sharpest spike since the start of the pandemic with around 1,432 fresh cases on Thursday.

On Thursday, a decomposed body of five-month-old cub of tigress T-60 was found in Gandhara forest region, where movement of intruder male tiger T-57 along with tigress T-63 was recorded. As per the forest staff, territories of big cats in the region are over-lapping and tiger T-102 is also frequently spotted in the region. RNP, DFO, Mahendra Sharma said, “It appears the cub died four to five days ago. The injuries sustained by the tiger cub revealed during the autopsy suggested that it could have fallen prey to a carnivorous.” As per official records, the cub was last captured by a trap camera on March 26. An intense search operation was initiated after the monitoring team could not record the pug marks of the cub in past few days. Sharma added, the movement of T-57 and T-63 was recorded on a waterhole in Gandhara region, where tigress T-60 along with her cub was spotted for the first time. “It was observed that T-60 was constantly roaring. Following the indication our team started monitoring and found the remains of the cub. It’s a difficult job to recover the body after three four days, as it decomposes very quickly in the wild,” he said Increasing tiger population in RNP has become a challenge for the park operators to provide space for wild cats to avoid conflicts. The Ranthambore reserve has a core area of 392sqkm, with a buffer zone of 1,342sqkm. Of the total area of little over 1,700sqkm in RTR, only 600sqkm can be used by tigers. The park has a total of 70 tigers, including 23 male, 29 female and 18 cubs. A wildlife expert said, “In a recent trend, it was witnessed that tigresses of Ranthambore are giving birth to cubs outside the park to provide safe habitat. For instance, T-102 gave birth to its cubs in the Ama Ghati area. Similarly, photographs of tigress T-107 were captured in the camera traps at the reserve’s Amreshwar forest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cub-of-t-60-killed-by-intruder-male-tiger/articleshow/81860027.cms||---

As of 7pm on Thursday, 82,992 people, including 34,254 people over 45 years, were inoculated. In Coimbatore, many were turned away and camps were “restricted” due to an acute shortage of vaccines. The western city, which was offering the vaccine to all adults, has been hit by severe shortage for the last few days. On Thursday, district officials said they had less than just 200 doses of Covaxin. The vaccines are now reserved only for those coming to take their second dose. The district also cancelled camps at PHCs as they had less than 10,000 doses of Covishield across hospitals. Many PHCs in rural and urban areas redirected people to medical college hospitals for the shot. Palanisamy, a retired bank manager, who visited Saravanampatti PHC with his family on Thursday, said he was asked to go to the GH. “I had to travel a bit, but we took the vaccine there,” he said. Many others decided to wait till the PHCs near their houses are re-stocked. Many hospitals in Chennai also ran out of Covaxin, but Greater Chennai Corporation held camps in residential complexes, besides urban primary health centres to boost coverage. “We asked the civic authorities to hold a camp for our apartment and they readily agreed. Many from the neighbourhood also turned up. Some took their second doses here,” said a resident of an apartment complex on ECR. As of 7am on Thursday, the state had 6.6 lakh doses, including 1.34 lakh doses of Covaxin. “Covaxin is available at all medical college hospitals. In smaller centres, is it reserved for people coming for the second dose,” said public health joint director (immunisation) Dr K Vinay Kumar. “We have adequate stock of the vaccine for at least five days. We are getting a fresh batch of Covishield on April 3. Another batch of Covaxin is expected on April 5,” he said. “There could be issues of redistribution in some centres, but we ensure no one is turned away.” In Madurai, vaccination was carried out from 207 sites. Deputy director of health services Dr K V Arjun Kumar said stocks were being redistributed and the district is expecting fresh stock soon. Trichy deputy director of health services Dr S Ramganesh, on the other hand, said lack of awareness and hesitancy has slowed down vaccination. “Many say they will take the vaccine after elections. We tell them not to postpone it as it is safe,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-hit-by-vaccine-shortage/articleshow/81860058.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Hike in safari fares at national parks draws flak||JAIPUR: The recent upward revision of fares in national parks and wildlife sanctuaries across the state during the pandemic came under criticism for being too steep. A day after rates and entry fee was increased by the forest department, cross-section of the society has expressed resentment over the move. Former Rajasthan tourism minister and Deeg Kumer MLA Vishwendra Singh said, “Ten percent increase in fees of wildlife sanctuaries every year will have a major impact on tourism. Since Corona, the tourism sector has been working hard to get back on track. The large number of tourists that visit national parks and wildlife sanctuaries will be impacted by this. In such a situation, the fee increase will affect the pockets of domestic and foreign tourists and they will hesitate to travel,” he said. In Rajasthan, the entry fee of tourists in national parks and wildlife sanctuaries has increased by 10%. These new rates have been implemented from April 1. This includes an increase in rates of tourist entrance fee, tourist vehicle entry fee, boat and electric vehicle entry fee, boating fee and camera fee. Nagendra Singh Hada, associated with wildlife tourism for past 30 years, said, “Timing of increasing the rates is not appropriate. Industry is already battling after the pandemic. All these issues will snowball into a bigger problem for tourism industry,” he said. As per the revised rates, an Indian tourist visiting Ranthambore Tiger Reserve in Sawai Madhopur will be charged Rs 140 and a foreigner will be charged Rs 1,070. For entry to Keoladeo National Park, Bharatpur; Sariska Tiger Reserve, Alwar and Mukundara Tiger Reserve, an Indian tourist will be charged Rs 105 and a foreign tourist Rs 675. In other sanctuaries, an Indian tourist will have to pay Rs 75 and foreign tourist Rs 410. As industry is thriving on domestic tourists, the revised tariff was criticized for being exorbitant. Jaideo Singh, a hotelier said, “Increase in prices is a big dent on domestic tourism. Indian are already cash strapped and such increase will alienate tourists to alternative destinations.” Box Pay more for boats, vans Tourists will have to pay an additional entry fee for vehicles, boats and electric vans. Tourists who want to hire a Gypsy in the Ranthambore Tiger Reserve will have to pay a fee of Rs 1,075. For those visiting Keoladeo National Park, Bharatpur; Sariska Tiger Reserve, Alwar and Mukundara Tiger Reserve they will have to pay Rs 345 for Gypsy and Jeep and Rs 540 for bus per vehicle per visit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hike-in-safari-fares-at-natl-parks-draws-flak/articleshow/81860025.cms||---

Also many of them won’t invest in artworks,” said Jyoti Arora who owns Splatter Studio.Vinod Daroz, a prominent ceramic artist, said, “We have a show planned in Mumbai this month but the spike in Covid cases has left all of us worried.

According to labour department officials, the last revised rates of minimum wages for unskilled labourers were fixed at Rs 292 per day. Similarly, semi-skilled labourers got Rs 304, skilled labourers Rs 370 and highly skilled labourers Rs 451 per day. A senior official of the labour resources department said on Thursday that the minimum wages are revised every six months under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 (XI of 1948) read with clause (B) of sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the said Act. The officer clarified that the minimum wages were revised twice a year. Hailing the government's hike in the minimum wages, a 45-year-old labourer Ramesh Chandra Pandit said, "It's now evident that the state government is serious about the welfare of the labourers of different categories. We all should appreciate this step." Labour resources department minister Jibesh Kumar said the state has altogether 14.87 lakh registered labourers of up to 60 years of age. They will be paid Rs 3,000 per annum for health facilities. The government has sanctioned Rs 446 crore for the purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-govt-raises-minimum-wages-for-workers/articleshow/81857813.cms||Ramashankar
---||Visakhapatnam||Dip in production hits Andhra Pradesh cashew industry||VISAKHAPATNAM: Scarcity of domestic raw materials is forcing owners of cashew kernel processing units in Srikakulam region to import from other countries. This is expected to result in further increase in prices of raw cashew nuts. Palasa and Kasibugga in Srikakulam are the biggest cashew processing centres in Andhra Pradesh with over 300 units. All units together produce over 60,000 kilograms of cashew kernels per day and record an annual turnover between Rs 250 crore and Rs 300 crore every year. Speaking to TOI, Malla Rameswara Rao — president of Industrial Estate and an owner of cashew processing unit in Palasa, said that manufacturers in the region have been facing severe scarcity due to decreased domestic raw cashew yield in Srikakulam and other parts of the state. “Cashew growers in north AP — Vizag, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts — have managed to supply only 30 to 40% of total requirements of cashew processing units,” he added. Cashews manufacturers in Srikakulam region claimed that they have been importing raw cashew from Ghana, Ivory Coast, Benin, Tanzania, Indonesia and few other countries through sea. Most of the raw cashew imports are coming from Ivory Coast and Ghana — over 4,000 tonnes per year. Normally, raw cashew is available in the local market between April and July but currently, only cashew manufacturers are purchasing and stocking the nuts. The Palasa cashew industry requires over 7,000 to 8,000 tonnes of raw cashew nuts every year. Due to the shortage of raw cashew nuts in the local market, traders have been importing raw material at round Rs 125 to Rs 140 per kilogram, depending on the quality of the nuts. Another cashew trader, Srinivas, said that cashew crop in over 1,600 hectares in parts of Srikakulam district had been destroyed due to cyclone Titli in 2018. The crop loss in Srikakulam and neighbouring Odisha due to the cyclone has been affecting the cashew industry for the past few years, forcing traders to import raw material from African countries. Palasa cashew is famous for its rich taste, unique flavour across the country but the industry has been losing its sheen due to shortage of locally-grown nuts. The Covid-19 pandemic and other reasons have also attributed to this decline. Traders are now expecting more imports of cashew over the coming days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/dip-in-production-hits-ap-cashew-industry/articleshow/81856955.cms||Nalla.Babu

It is also the first of 623 farm-based solar projects selected by RRECL for generating 722 MW capacity in the state under the first phase of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evem Utthan Mahabhiyan (Kusum) scheme. Commissioning the project, energy minister BD Kalla said that it is a matter of pride that Rajasthan has become the first state to commission the project. “It will help the farmers to earn additional income through their unused land. The state government has decided to develop 2600 MW capacity under the scheme. Awards has already been issued to 623 applicants,” said Kalla. The project in Kotputali has a 25-year contract between the RRECL and farmland owner Devkaran Yadav. The contract was signed on September 2, 2020 and the project has been developed at an investment of nearly Rs 3.7 crore. “The project commissioned on Thursday is expected to generate 17 lakh units of electricity per year, which will be purchased by the Rajasthan Vidhyut Vitran Nigam Ltd at rate of Rs 3.14 per unit. This will generate an annual income of nearly Rs 50 lakh for the farmer,” said Subodh Agarwal, chariman and MD of RRECL. Kusum scheme was launched by Centre to help farmers generate solar energy. RRECL has been implementing the scheme in the state to help farmers generate revenue from their less-productive or barren land. Agarwal said, “It will also help to increase clean green energy and employment in the rural areas.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/countrys-first-farm-based-kusum-solar-power-project-commissioned-in-kotputli/articleshow/81860052.cms||---

Some cases of compensation and some court cases pertaining to the land are pending. Upon completion, traffic congestion in the city will be eased to a large extent. National highway 16 passes through the port city and stretches for over 50 kilometres from Anandapuram to Aganampudi. Once operational, all heavy vehicles will be routed through this stretch. The project was started in January 2019 but the pandemic and the consequent lockdown have slowed work down with workers, most of them migrants, going back to their native places.  Due to the conditions arising as a result of the pandemic, the project deadline was extended till October this year but the contractor is on the path to completing works three months before the proposed deadline. Works on the bypasses in Pendurthi, Sabbavaram are taking place at a rapid pace as are the works on interchange roads at Anandapuram and Anakapalle. Works on two railway over-bridges have also started. The express highway will have four toll plazas, in Gudilova, Batajangala, Pendurthi, and Sabbavaram. Works on the first two toll plazas are underway while the ones in Pendurthu and Sabbavaram will be taken up following the completion of bypass roads. As per sources, 10 flyovers will be constructed on the 50-kilometre highway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/anakapalle-anandapuram-six-lane-to-be-ready-by-july/articleshow/81856874.cms||Siva G
---||Kolkata||Heads of Catholic and CNI churches pray for peaceful polls in services||Kolkata: These are difficult times and we should start our prayers for the Holy Week leading up to Easter, asking God to help the state go to the polls peacefully and uphold what the country has been the greatest example of : democracy. This was at the heart of the prayers said by the heads of the Catholic church and the Church of North India on Thursday. Churches across the city celebrated Maundy Thursday through special evening services after which solemn pledges were taken following traditions to return for services for Good Friday. Christians were happy and relieved that despite the threat of the pandemic yet again, they could attend the services, though a slew of Covid protocols were maintained. Last year the lockdown was in vogue during the Holy Week and the religious heads went on to hold prayers in the virtual mode. Churches formed whatsapp groups to knit parishioners together so that no one was left out of the fold. Bishop Paritosh Canning highlighted the fact that there was palpable tension all around because of the elections and peace was somehow missing. “I have asked all our churches to hold special prayers for peaceful elections in the state. This is that time of the year when we are told to once again remember God’s sacrifice for us through his unconditional love and forgiveness. Can we not translate that into our real lives?” he asked as he conducted services in St Paul’s Church, Keorapukur for Maundy Thursday. He will conduct mass on Good Friday at St Thomas Church, Howrah and St Peter’s Church, Behala. Archbishop Thomas D Souza echoed this when he said, “Let us all pray for a peaceful poll process during this Holy Week. This is the time when God taught us how to immerse ourselves in servitude and love for humanity. May those words guide us.” Vicar General of the Archdiocese of Kolkata, Dominic Gomes read mass at St Thomas Church, Middleton Row, where he highlighted the importance of staying peaceful and uphold democracy. “The beauty of democracy lies in accepting and respecting differences. We are thankful that we can kneel in prayers and ask for grace at this time,” he said. Churchgoers were seen turning up in big numbers for the evening services on Thursday. All were masked, hands were sanitised, distanced sitting was followed and volunteers ensured that no one broke queues as they came in and filed out of the church. “We don’t mind the restrictions, we are so thankful that we are once again able to physically attend mass on Maundy Thursday. Last year’s fearful thoughts come back to haunt us though,” said Angela Ghosh. In Catholic churches towels were given to the 12 chosen parishioners symbolising the Washing of the Feet ritual. According to the gospels Jesus washed the feet of his disciples in the evening and then came, The Last Supper with the Apostles. On Good Friday he was crucified, to rise again on Easter Sunday. All churches have put out the timings for the Good Friday mass. eom||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/heads-of-catholic-and-cni-churches-pray-for-peaceful-polls-in-services/articleshow/81860116.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

While GMDA water pipelines have been catering to several housing societies in the area, the developer of ILD Greens hasn’t applied for the water connection yet. Seeking an intervention in the matter, a group of residents last Friday met MLA Rakesh Daultabad. “There are two pipelines of 1,300 mm and 1,600 mm through which water is being supplied to various other societies in the area. This builder, however, has not applied for the water connection yet,” said a GMDA official after an inspection of the site on Saturday. When contacted for a comment on the issue, the senior official of the developer refused to comment. The residents complained that since 2016 they have been relying on private tankers as a temporary measure. However, the developer has failed to pay the vendors on time causing a frequent disruption in the water supply, the residents alleged. They said that the builder is a serial offender of non-payment of dues despite levying high maintenance charges on them. Sandeep Sharma of ILD Greens RWA said, “Last week we had faced severe water shortage for over four days. After running pillar to post, the builder started partial water supply in the society but we don’t know how long it will continue. Every other month, we have to worry about one issue or the other.” Currently, out of the seven towers in the society, three towers are occupied and over 140 families residing in them. They further alleged that they have made several complaints to officials concerned but in vain. Vipin Chauhan, vice president of ILD Greens RWA said: “We have written multiple times to the authorities concerned to ensure that the builder complied with the OC conditions of providing a permanent water and electricity connection, but nothing has been done to address our concerns. We are paying our maintenance fee to the builder but the same is not being paid to vendors. Moreover, the water which is being supplied through tankers has high TDS levels, raising health concerns among residents.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/no-water-supply-to-society-pvt-tankers-cash-in-on-shortage/articleshow/81863309.cms||Akanksha Gupta

Issuing notice to Delhi Police on the petition by a man who claimed that he and three others were “mercilessly beaten, illegally detained, tortured by the police personnel of Police Post Turkman Gate, Police Station Chandni Mahal, Central District, Delhi, at the behest of certain private individuals at the aforesaid police post,” the court asked the police to submit its stand. Justice Anu Malhotra also ordered the police to preserve the CCTV footage of the post on the day of the incident. The counsel for the police assured the court that “if the CCTV footage is available, it would be preserved.” The court said that the printouts of the footage be placed on record and an updated status report be submitted. It then listed the matter for further hearing on April 8. As per the plea, the petitioner and three others were illegally detained and tortured by the cops even when there was neither any written complaint against them nor a PCR call. The four sustained injuries and the incident was also captured in the CCTV cameras installed in and around the police post, it stated. Opposing the plea, the police maintained that the matter relates to a conflict between a husband-wife and the petitioner is the cousin of the husband while other cousins were involved in a dispute. The plea said that police have neither concluded the preliminary inquiry within the stipulated period of 15 days nor initiated any legal action against the alleged delinquent police officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-seeks-report-from-cops-on-plea-alleging-illegal-detention/articleshow/81860126.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Court refuses bail to man seen damaging CCTV during riots||New Delhi: A court has refused bail to a man who was allegedly seen damaging a CCTV camera during the northeast Delhi violence. The accused claimed in his bail petition that he was trying to fix the focus of the camera, but the court observed after seeing a footage that he had a stick in one hand and a brick in the other, prima facie substantiating the fact that he was an active member of a riotous mob. Javed Ali and Parvez had sought bail through counsel Dinesh Tiwari in a case involving rioting, murder and criminal conspiracy charges. Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav passed a common order for both and rejected their plea. “Applicant Javed Ali is clearly seen/visible damaging the CCTV camera,” he noted. The court further said the two men could threaten or intimidate witnesses if allowed bail. The order highlighted that the bail of a co-accused was dismissed on September 4, 2020 and their counsel couldn’t point out any difference in the role attributed to the applicants and that co-accused. Tiwari earlier alleged that police had a “planted witness”. He claimed that though Ali was seen holding a stick, he was only trying to “fix the focus of the CCTV”. Parvez, Tiwari submitted, was not visible in any video clip. The defence argued that bail was not to be withheld as a punishment before the trial and mere filing of the chargesheet did not prove the guilt. “Pre-trial detention has been deprecated by the courts and bail is the rule and jail is an exception,” it was submitted. Special public prosecutor Amit Prasad, however, pointed out that the case pertained to the murder of a riot victim as he belonged to a different community. The court was informed that according to the eyewitness, the accused had incited religious feelings of a particular community to cause maximum damage to the other community. The court observed, “From the evidence of a number of witnesses recorded in the matter, it is prima facie apparent that the ‘riotous mob’ armed with ‘lethal weapons’ had engaged in vandalism, looting and torching of public and private properties and their main objective was to cause maximum damage to the lives and properties of persons belonging to other community.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-refuses-bail-to-man-seen-damaging-cctv-during-riots/articleshow/81860260.cms||Aamir Khan

On Wednesday, Maharashtra had received 26.8 lakh Covishield doses, which were given to districts that have had a high Covid-19 caseload, said state immunisation officer Dr D N Patil. Patil further said the districts do have vials in reserve. “This may last 10 days or less, depending on how vaccination progresses. There should be a continuous supply of doses.” Data shows the state currently has around 8.3 lakh doses left. All of them have been distributed among the districts along with the fresh batch of 26.8 lakh doses that were received on Wednesday. Also, while availability of Covishield has improved, distribution of Covaxin continues to be limited. State health officials said with the addition of the above-45 group, the state is now aiming to vaccinate a target population of 4.5 crore people (up from from the earlier 1.8 crore). The new target would mean an increase in the number of daily jabs and vaccine demand. “We are currently vaccinating nearly 2.7 lakh people daily. With the inclusion of the new beneficiaries, the number is likely to increase to 5 lakh per day,” an official said. Since January 16—the day the vaccination programme began—Maharashtra has inoculated 62.45 lakh beneficiaries, including health workers, frontline workers, the elderly and people aged above 45 with comorbidities. Of these, 4.8 lakh health workers and 2.6 lakh frontline workers have received both doses. On Thursday, the Centre, following discussions with the states, decided to carry out vaccination on all days of April, at both private and government centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maha-asks-centre-for-35l-doses-a-week-to-support-45-plus-drive-in-maharashta/articleshow/81857113.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand govt releases Rs 2 crore for contentious Laldhang-Chillarkhal road||DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand’s only corridor between the Corbett Tiger Reserve and Rajaji Tiger Reserve has once again come in the limelight after the state government on the last day of the financial year (March 31) released Rs 2 crore for the construction of the Laldhang-Chillarkhal road which would run through the lone wildlife corridor in the state. The funds have been released even as the controversial project, which is being pushed by state forest minister Harak Singh Rawat, has not got permission from either the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) or National Board for Wildlife (NBWL). Sources said that in February, on the directions of NBWL, a committee of members of Doon-based Wildlife Institute of India (WII), NTCA, NHAI and forest department was formed and inspection of the road was also conducted. The report was submitted on March 21. Thereafter, the road issue was raised before the NBWL on March 30 where it was once again deferred and no decision was taken on giving clearance. Yet, the funds were released by the state government just a day later to proceed with road construction works. Irked at what they term as blatant sidestepping of clearances, environmental activists have decided to approach the Supreme Court. Doon-based activist Reenu Paul alleged, "The most sensitive zone in the stretch is about 4.5 km from Chamaraia bend to Siggadi and has four water streams. It has already been constructed, as per our information. Taking clearance is just an eye wash as barely a few metres of work is left that needs completion. This will again be challenged at the apex level." Elaborating on the violations of various environmental and wildlife acts, she added, "The step of Uttarakhand government to construct the road is a clear violation of SC’s June 2019 direction wherein it had directed the state to cancel the forest land clearances taken by them in bits and pieces for the 11.5 km-long road. The SC had asked to take fresh permission for the entire stretch under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 from MoEF’s forest clearance division followed by wildlife clearances under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 from the NBWL. But neither of them have been received yet.” Meanwhile, forest minister Harak Singh Rawat through a video statement after release of funds on Wednesday, said, "I am happy that years of struggle to connect Haridwar with Kotdwar through motorway is going to fructify. Our government in accordance to the directions of the NBWL and SC has come out with the government order (GO) regarding Laldhang-Chillarkhal motorway funds. During Covid pandemic, we saw that the people of Kotdwar had to struggle to reach AIIMS-Rishikesh because they had to take approval from the Bijnor district administration.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-govt-releases-rs-2-crore-for-contentious-laldhang-chillarkhal-road/articleshow/81857111.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Delhi||GPS, cams must for vehicles carrying construction waste||New Delhi: The environment department has issued guidelines that any goods vehicle proposed to be used for carrying construction and demolition (C&D) waste should be fitted with GPS to enable live monitoring by the civic agency. Only CNG-based vehicles will be allowed to carry C&D waste and a camera should be fitted in the rear portion of the vehicle. The recording of a minimum of seven days should be preserved for random checking by enforcement agencies. The guidelines have been issued in the wake of diesel goods vehicles with national permits being used for disposal of C&D waste in Delhi, which contributes to air pollution. According to the guidelines, in case a vehicle is found stopped/parked at an undesignated place, the penalty will be collected from the vehicle owner by the transport department. All the vehicles being used for collection and disposal of C&D waste will require registration from the civic body concerned. The civic bodies will also have to geo-fence these vehicles to ensure that they do not stray into non-designated areas. “If the vehicles are found to be dumping waste in non-designated areas, it will be treated as a violation and the offenders will have to pay the environmental penalty. This will be in addition to the requisite action taken against the violators under the relevant statute,” said an official of the environment department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gps-cams-must-for-vehicles-carrying-construction-waste/articleshow/81878284.cms||---

The poll panel also advised Raja “to be watchful and not to make intemperate, indecent, derogatory, obscene remarks and lower the dignity of women in future during election campaign”. The 48-hour ban means that Raja would not be able to address any public meetings, rallies, press conferences or even give media interviews until April 3. In fact, until the silence period kicks in for Tamil Nadu poll on April 4 evening, any expenditure on campaigning by him would have to be borne by the respective candidate or candidates. Meanwhile, the Madras high court on Thursday declined to urgently hear DMK’s plea against Election Commission’s decision to debar Raja from campaigning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/tamil-nadu/election-commission-bars-raja-from-campaign-for-48-hours/articleshow/81865817.cms||---

It’s a small community of about 25 people in the city, who are observing the most important time of the year, though the Covid precautions are keeping them from calling each other home. Though there are three Jewish synagogues in the city, Passover service cannot happen because a quorum of 10 Jewish men will have to be present for a service to happen. However, since it is celebrated at home with larger family sitting around the Seder table and reading the Hagadah, this is what most Jews in the city are doing for the Passover celebrations. “It is a recounting of the history of people who left behind slavery and bondage in Egypt to freedom. For 40 years our people moved about in the desert. We remember this history over readings and feast on Kosher food,” said Jael Silliman, a member of the community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-jews-observe-passover/articleshow/81860203.cms||---

The reason for their lackadaisical approach was to protect their colleague and improper investigation resulted in the acquittal of constable Dasarath. In November 2020, Dundigal constable Dasarath was arrested for allegedly assaulting a couple and forcibly taking two gold rings from their possession. A robbery case was booked against Dasarath. SI Sekhar Reddy of the Dundigal police station was the investigating officer (IO) of the case and after the trial, a local court had acquitted the constable in January 2021, Pet Basheerabad ACP VVS Ramalinga Raju said. Learning that the accused was acquitted as the victim turned hostile, Cyberabad police commissioner VC Sajjanar took the matter seriously. In the internal inquiry, it was found that court constable Mahesh Kumar, did not properly appraise the investigation officer and the inspector about the proceedings of the case. Police said that constable Mahesh Kumar was suspended. SI Sekhar Reddy, who investigated the case, and inspector Venkatesham have been attached to the Armed Reserve head quarters of the Commissionerate, pending full inquiry. Cyberabad police have filed an appeal before the sessions judge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cops-penalised-forshielding-colleague/articleshow/81860229.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand’s Tharu community celebrates Holi till 8 days after festival, but locals say tradition fading with time||NAINITAL: Even though most of the country celebrated Holi on Monday, the celebrations in several villages in Khatima, Nanakmatta and Sitarganj areas of Uttarakhand are still on. The Tharu community — which is mostly concentrated in these areas — celebrates Holi till eight days after Holika Dahan. Members of the community said that they celebrate Holi in two ways. “While some of the villages celebrate Zinda (Live) Holi, the others celebrate Mari (Dead) Holi. The first kind is celebrated for a fortnight till Holika Dahan while the other is celebrated for at least eight days after the festival, but no village celebrates both of them,” said Rajveer Singh Rana, president of Rana-Tharu Yuva Manch. Meanwhile, historians said that the Zinda Holi is celebrated from the day of Purnima to Holika Dahan and the Mari Holi is celebrated for eight days after Dhulandi. “Throughout the period, there is much dancing, music and revelry. The married men, according to the tradition, prefer wearing their wedding dresses, but not the women folk. Earlier, men and women used to dance separately forming circles but now they also dance together,” said Ajay Singh Rawat, Nainital-based historian. Rawat added that all the songs sung by the Tharus showcase community participation and goodwill. The villagers also go to every household and tender apologies for any misdeed committed in the past year. “Traditionally, on the onset of Holi, a small semal (Bombax ceiba) tree is burnt in an open space near the goddess Bhumisen temple. The next day, the village headman with the villagers offers puja at the temple. After the function is over at the temple, the villagers go to the headman’s house where they are offered sweets and jaggery and return to their houses,” he said. However, the locals now rue the fact that with time, the traditional Holi celebrations have diminished as many locals have moved to big cities and most of the young are not familiar with the history or the traditional songs and music that are played on the occasion. “Not many of them even know how to play the dhol. Very few people are left in the village who are familiar with the history and the tradition associated with our Holi celebrations,” Rana said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhands-tharu-community-celebrates-holi-till-8-days-after-festival-but-locals-say-tradition-fading-with-time/articleshow/81857144.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Hyderabad||MLA Chennamaneni Ramesh not an Indian citizen, MHA informs Telangana HC||HYDERABAD: In an interesting development, the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) on Thursday informed the Telangana high court that Vemulawada MLA Chennamaneni Ramesh is still a German citizen. He is not an Indian citizen. Hence, he was also given Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) status, which is meant for foreign citizens and not for resident Indians. The ministry’s undersecretary, Ashutosh Anand, filed an affidavit to this effect citing the information he received from the Indian mission in Berlin. Assistant solicitor general N Rajeswara Rao filed the affidavit on behalf of the central government before Justice Ahinand Kumar Shavili, who was hearing a petition filed by Congress leader Adi Srinivas. The Congress leader was contending that since Ramesh is not an Indian citizen, he needs to be disqualified as a legislator. The high court had earlier directed the central government to ascertain the latest status of Ramesh in this regard. It was in response to this, the Centre has now filed an affidavit narrating the information it could collect from the German authorities. The MLA’s counsel sought time to file a rejoinder to this and he was given two weeks for the same. Ashutosh, in his affidavit, also described the details obtained from the German embassy in New Delhi. The consular, passport, and visa (CPV) division of the ministry of external affairs contacted the German embassy for the purpose and it said that “a person might hold a German passport. But he or she does not have to be a German citizen. If you want more details about an individual, we are not authorized to give you. You have to follow a legal procedure for obtaining the same”. The German embassy and foreign office cannot share such information, and advised that existing legal assistance procedures might be used in such cases to seek assistance from the German authorities, Ashutosh said, citing the memo filed by the CPV division. Citing the information obtained from the Immigration, Visa, and Foreigners’ Tracking (IVFRT) system, the Union home ministry, in its affidavit, said Ramesh Chennamaneni continued to be in possession of a German passport and travelled abroad using his German passport even after acquiring Indian citizenship. The Telangana government had entered into a tussle last month and claimed that in matters relating to the home department, the state must have a final say. The case would come up for hearing after two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mla-ramesh-not-an-indian-citizen-mha-informs-hc/articleshow/81860291.cms||---

The TDP has fielded Arun Kumar Muvva from Nagarjuna Sagar for the April 17 bypoll. Jana Reddy had won the seat in 1989 but on Congress ticket and lost to TDP’s G Ram Murthy in 1994. The TDP ended up runners-up in 1999, 2004 and 2009 elections from this constituency and secured a third place in 2014 polls. Though Naidu has directed the party leaders to go the people and explain to them the work being done by the TDP government especially in irrigation and road development when the state was united, political analysts ruled out the possibility of TDP making an impact in the bypoll. “Even smaller parties and independents are in the fray. TDP is a long-gone chapter in Telangana. It could not make any impact on the prospects of other candidates in the elections it contested in the last few years in Telangana,” said former MLC K Nageshwar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telugu-desam-tries-hard-to-be-relevant-in-telangana-politics/articleshow/81860391.cms||Roushan Ali

The seer alleged that the government is “applying double standards in the name of the pandemic”. “There are no restrictions on election rallies but the government has imposed several restrictions on Kumbh in the name of the pandemic. If these are not double standards, then what are?” he added. Interacting with mediapersons at shankaracharya’s camp, installed in the Kumbh at Neeldhara island in Haridwar, the seer said, “Kumbh Mela is held after 12 years and devotees wait to take the holy dip on shahi snan (royal bathing festivals) during the Kumbh, but the government has imposed restrictions citing Covid-19. It is the duty of the government to provide a safe environment to the pilgrims for the Kumbh as it is the fundamental right of Hindus. Will Covid target only religious gatherings? Election rallies are organised without any restrictions. How do they manage such huge crowds during election rallies? This needs to be disclosed.” He also targeted the government for creating a ‘negative environment’ in the country. He said, “Everyone has the right to freedom of expression but nowadays, common people fear speaking up against the wrong decisions and policies of the government. The government is trying to control even religion by imposing its agenda.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kumbh-restrictions-violation-of-rights-of-hindus-govt-using-double-standards-says-shankaracharya-representative/articleshow/81857220.cms||MS Nawaz

Huge rush was at NMC’s Indira Gandhi Rugnalaya (IGR), KT Nagar Urban Primary Health Centre, Isolation Hospital, Pachpaoli Hospital and GMCH. The centres distributed tokens to people in hourly slots. This meant beneficiaries had to visit the centres twice. A resident of Khamla Sunil Sadhwani (45) told TOI, “I reached GMCH at 7.30am to find some people in queue. They gave us tokens. I was given token of 3pm. I had to go to the centre again but did not have to wait at all as staffers registered me and gave me vaccine immediately.” People like him travelled far to get Covaxin. Among 83 centres in city, Covaxin is available at only six. NMC has started vaccination centre at Pandey layout near Khamla where Covishield is available. Rush was seen at NMC’s Pandey layout UPHC. Sunil Shinde (59) from Sahakar Nagar said, “I was not eligible earlier as have no comorbidity. After I heard about beginning of vaccination for everyone above 45 years from April 1, I registered online on Wednesday. I booked a slot at NMC’s Pandey Layout UPHC. It was easy but I had to stand in queue for sometime.” Advocate Suryakant Gajbhiye, Milind Pande, Sulochna Mahalle, Chandrashekar Peshkar and Ketki Peshkar who took the jab at NMC’s centres were delighted and expressed gratitude towards the government for covering all the people above 45. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said, “NMC will increase free of cost centres from 40 to 50 soon. Number of private hospitals will be also increased from 43 to 71 in a couple of days. We are running around 10 centres in two shifts from 8am to 10pm.” Joshi also said, “All 40 NMC and government centres have three separate counters and queues. One for healthcare workers and frontline workers, one for second dose of age-appropriate group and pre-registered people of 45-59 years and one for on-spot registration.” Some people had to face inconvenience at centres in private hospitals. A private hospital in Subhash Nagar continued to start vaccination at 12noon. At other centres, there were no separate counters and even pre-registered people had to stand in queues or take tokens and visit a second time. Joshi said he would look into delayed start of vaccination at private hospital. “It is mandatory to start at 9am. It is up to the centres to run after 5pm,” he said. With addition of people above 45 years, a few more sectors, and commencement of second dose of age-appropriate group, the number of beneficiaries increased. Total of 21,796 took the jab on Thursday as against average of below 10,000 per day in the last week. Vaccination centres also increased from 217 to 228. Some centres had administered as many as 680 doses in the day but average 200 can be inoculated at each centre easily as per NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar. Accordingly, 45,600 people can be vaccinated in a day but achievement was 47.8% on Thursday. Guardian minister Nitin Raut had directed the officials to open 300 centres and ensure inoculation of 40,000 people everyday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/over-12k-in-45-59-group-take-jab-on-day-1-centres-open-all-days-in-april/articleshow/81860529.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Dehradun||Kumbh curtailment not a first, massive fire and cholera played spoilsport at mega event earlier too||The Kumbh Mela, which usually starts in January and is four months long, has been reduced to a single month this time because of the pandemic. In its recorded history, the Kumbh has never been completely called off, even though curbs were sometimes placed on it. Providing examples of these instances, Haridwar-based scholar Acharya Vishnu Dutt Rakesh, told TOI, “In the 1938 Haridwar Maha Kumbh, two disasters took place. A fire broke out at a slum along Ganga and there was a cholera outbreak at the mela premises. Both disasters led to huge loss of life and property. People fled the mela premises. Some were already infected and ended up spreading the infection in the rest of the country.” He added that “at the next Kumbh event in Haridwar, the 1944 Ardh Kumbh, the-then British government put a ban on the congregation." However, the mela was still held. According to Rakesh, as land had already been allotted for seers and all preparations were made, the ban caused quite a distress among devotees. However, after seers approached the Hindu Mahasabha members in Delhi, and the latter negotiated with the government, the mela was finally allowed to be held. The Haridwar Kumbh of 1938, like that of this year, was held after 11 years instead of 12. Pradeep Jha, the head of Ganga Sabha, the body which administers the main Har-ki-Pauri ghat, said that the mela which is held after 11 years is generally not considered auspicious. “Kumbh is held in Haridwar when the planets Jupiter and Sun enter certain zodiac positions. This is the second time that Jupiter completed its cycle early and the Haridwar Kumbh is being held after 11 years instead of 12. The last time the event was held after 11 years -- in 1938, thousands of pilgrims were killed in a fire at Har-ki-Pauri,” Jha said. He added that “we believe that the inauspicious time has now passed and the mela will be blessed”. Recollecting a few more instances when the format of the mela was changed, Doon-based historian and anthropologist Lokesh Ohri said, “The British administration often played around with the format of the festival. During World War II, they banned the Kumbh Mela to conserve scarce supplies of fuel. The ban, coupled with rumours that Japan planned to bomb and commit genocide at the fair, led to sharply-lowered attendance at the 1942 Kumbh Mela held at Allahabad.” Ohri said that “the phrase ‘Kumbh Mela’ and historical data about the event is missing in early Indian texts.” “However, the tradition of communal bathing dates back to Indus Valley times as borne by the Great Bath at Mohenjo-Daro. Several historical texts clearly reveal large, well-established bathing festivals at sites like Haridwar that were either annual or based on the twelve-year cycle of the planet Jupiter,” he said. He added that “Mughal-era texts that contain the term ‘Kumbh Mela’ in Haridwar's context include Khulasat-ut-Tawarikh (1695–1699) and Chahar Gulshan (1759).” “An early account of the Haridwar Kumbh Mela was published by Captain Thomas Hardwicke in 1796. The mela at Haridwar, as a major bathing festival, in its earlier avatar was referred to as the Magh Mela,” Ohri said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kumbh-curtailment-not-a-first-massive-fire-and-cholera-played-spoilsport-at-mega-event-earlier-too/articleshow/81857230.cms||Megha Adhikari
---||Dehradun||'Uttarakhand jails functioning at over 200% occupancy'||NAINITAL: An affidavit filed by IG (Prisons), AP Anshuman, before the Uttarakhand high court (HC) has revealed that several jails in Uttarakhand, including the district jail in Dehradun, are functioning at over 200% occupancy while more than 30% of the posts in the jail department are lying vacant. The report was filed by Anshuman after the HC widened the scope of a PIL concerned with the release of inmates who have been languishing in jails even after serving for over 14 years. The matter is being heard by the bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma who had said that prisons across the country continue to be medieval in their functioning and that it is time they are brought to modern age. “The report reveals that even the district jail of Dehradun which has the capacity to house 580 inmates has over 1,400 prisoners. The report goes on to say that there are over 1,300 sanctioned posts in the prison department, and over 400 of them are still vacant. Jails in Roorkee, Haridwar, Haldwani and US Nagar are facing a similar situation,” an advocate present in the hearing said. The court, however, expressed its displeasure over Anshuman’s report saying that a mere perusal reveals that the affidavit is “shorn of any concrete details and is absolutely vague in its content”. It noted that even though the IG has said that over 400 posts are lying vacant, there is no clarity as to how and when they will be filled. It further noted that there is a “grave problem of overcrowding” in state’s jails and though three new jails are proposed to be built, there are no details in the affidavit about when they were sanctioned, their current status and capacity. “The court also expressed its displeasure over the status of CCTV cameras in jails. It said that there is no clarity about the skill training being given to the prisoners. The affidavit further said that Sri Sri Ravi Shankar’s foundation is involved in training the prisoners, but there were no details,” the advocate said. The court has now directed IG (Prisons) to file a fresh and detailed affidavit and listed the case for further hearing on April 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/several-jails-in-ukhand-functioning-at-over-200-occupancy-ig-prisons-informs-hc/articleshow/81857275.cms||Prashant Jha

The teachers said that since they were forced to work from home due to the lockdown they cannot show attendance record. In its statement, JNUTA said that the circular issued on March 30 for recovery of transport allowance, citing a ministry of finance directive, “is bereft of all logic. Seeking details of physical attendance for the period, March 23 to May 20 — when people were forced to work from home due to the lockdown — appears odd.” The circular stated that, “Transport allowance is not payable to those who have not attended the office physically.” Despite attempts by TOI, there was no response from the JNU administration.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jnuta-opposes-admn-move-to-recover-transport-allowance/articleshow/81860667.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Additional mela officer roughed up by Bairagi seers over ‘mismanagement’||Haridwar: On the first day of the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar, the Bairagi seers of Nirmohi akhada allegedly roughed up additional mela officer Harbeer Singh and a security guard accompanying him over ‘mismanagement in the Bairagi camp’. The incident took place around 8 pm on Thursday when Singh along with other officials was interacting with the seers at Bairagi camp. According to the eyewitnesses of the incident, a few seers attacked additional mela officer Harbeer Singh and when the security guard accompanying him tried to save him, he was also beaten up. Subsequently, the guard fainted at the spot. Upon getting information of the incident, senior police officers, including IG Kumbh mela Sanjay Gunjyal, reached the spot and pacified the seers. Later, Gunjyal said that some miscreants had pushed the additional mela officer. The officer has sustained minor injuries. A probe has been launched into the incident. On the other hand, the Bairagi seers have denied their involvement in the incident and claimed that some outsiders had created the ruckus. “There is a lack of basic facilities like electricity, toilets and potable water in our area. We have requested the mela administration multiple times to provide us with basic amenities. When we were discussing the issue on Thursday, some outsiders created a ruckus,” said Mahant Rajendra Das of Nirmohi akhada. Meanwhile, the Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad (ABAP) has condemned the incident. Mahant Narendra Giri, president of ABAP told TOI, “It is a very unfortunate incident. Physical violence goes against the very nature of a seer. A meeting of akhadas has been called on Friday. All akhadas, except the Nirmohi akhada, will participate in the meeting. If allegations are found true, action will be taken against the Nirmohi akhada.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/additional-mela-officer-roughed-up-by-bairagi-seers-over-mismanagement/articleshow/81857322.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Bareilly||UP: Girl found talking to young tailor staff filmed, shamed; 4 booked||BAREILLY: A 19-year-old girl, who had visited a local tailor shop to give her clothes for stitching and allegedly seen talking to one of its young staff, was grabbed by a few men and "publicly shamed", police said. The girl and the youth belong to the minority community and purported video clips of her pleading before the men allegedly from a different community not to harm her and film the clip has gone viral. The incident occurred in Hafizganj area of Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly district on Wednesday. According to police, the two of them were seen talking to each other when they were caught and harassed by the men. An FIR against four identified and several unidentified persons have been registered at Hafizganj police station on the complaint of the girl's brother. All the identified accused belong to a different religion, the police said. The cops, however, ruled out any communal angle behind the incident, for now, and added that it could be a case of "moral policing". Talking to TOI, the girl said, “I went to a local tailor shop to give my clothes for stitching and was asked to wait. The main tailor was not there. All of a sudden, few men came and pulled the shutter down. A few others joined them and they started misbehaving with me. They removed my drape and touched me inappropriately and then shot videos. They humiliated me." "My entire family is in a state of shock. The men filmed videos which are being seen by everyone. The videos should be immediately removed from social networking sites and action should be taken against the culprits. The government should ensure that this shouldn’t happen to other girls like me,” she added. The girl’s father said that his daughter visited a tailor shop when a few men molested her, shot videos and thrashed her. When contacted, additional SP (rural) Raj Kumar Agarwal said, “The police rescued both the individuals. They were sent back home after providing initial treatment. An FIR was later registered on the complaint of girl’s brother. We also came to know that the videos of the incident were uploaded and widely circulated. Strict action will be taken against the culprits." The FIR has been registered under IPC sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 504 (intentional insult) against four identified persons, Agarwal said, adding that the case is under investigation and more sections will be added after recording the girl’s statement. None of the accused have been arrested yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/girl-19-found-talking-to-young-tailor-staff-filmed-publicly-shamed-in-up-4-booked/articleshow/81854479.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Delhi||Under fresh Covid shadow, Delhi zoo opens doors to visitors||NEW DELHI: The National Zoological Park, more popularly called Delhi Zoo, threw its gates open to visitors on Thursday after more than a year. It shut down first due to the Covid-19 lockdown and then the outbreak of bird flu. While only around 2,000 visitors in two shifts of four hours each will be allowed in initially, the zoo authorities said more would be let in after the Covid-19 protocols currently being tested are deemed safe. Between the two shifts is an hour’s break when the zoo premises is disinfected. The entry tickets are available only online, taking many visitors off-guard. Javed, a 23-year-old student, had problems gaining entry. “Admission is only through online tickets or by scanning a QR code. I don’t use online payment apps and so there was no way for me to go in. I had cash, but there was no provision for ticket sale,” he said. TimesViewFor a year now, Covid-19 has been playing cat and mouse with us. Cases rise, fall, then rise again. The key to restoring new normalcy is to choose the right time to open up. Strangely, the Delhi zoo stayed shut right through winter when cases were down and is reopening now when cases are spiralling again. One hopes that the authorities will enforce mask usage and other precautions with utmost seriousness among visitors.Ramesh Pandey, director, Delhi Zoo, said Thursday’s feedback from people will be considered while increasing the number of QR code boards to make ticket purchasing easier. The number of gates open to allow entry is also likely to be increased. “The arrangements in place are meant to handle a limited crowd, so we will gradually relax the limit on the number of visitors,” said Pandey. “We have to ensure it is safe inside the zoo and all Covid guidelines are followed, including wearing of masks. We disinfect the railings and other areas in the one-hour period just before the second shift from 1pm to 5 pm.” Avishek Banerjee had brought his four-year-old daughter and wife, having wanted to visit the zoo for some time. He had frequently called the zoo in the last couple of months to find out when it would reopen. “We came early when the park is relatively empty and cool. My daughter wanted to see elephants and tigers,” he smiled. Student Saarthak Jain felt the restricted crowd was a good idea because it would reassure visitors. “After reading about this, I decided to come to the zoo with friends. It is peaceful inside and it is good to see some new animals too,” said Jain. During the lockdown, the zoo brought in more animals, increasing the number of species present from 83 to 88. A sloth bear, for instance, is a new resident. Other additions, such as an ostrich, are likely to arrive later this month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/under-fresh-covid-shadow-zoo-opens-doors-to-visitors/articleshow/81860696.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

---||Dehradun||Salt by-poll: BJP removes rape-accused MLA from the list of star campaigners after controversy||Dehradun: Following a controversy over its list of ‘star campaigners’ for the Salt by-poll, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday issued a fresh list with names of 30 party leaders. The new list includes the names of former chief ministers Trivendra Singh Rawat and Vijay Bahuguna and omits the name of Dwarahat MLA Mahesh Negi, who is accused in a rape case. In its previous list, the BJP had not included Trivendra Singh Rawat and Vijay Bahuguna. Taking a swipe over the saffron party's initial list, Congress vice president Suryakant Dhasmana told TOI, “The initial list is a clear message that the BJP has made Trivendra SIngh Rawat the sacrificial goat for its failure in the last four years. In its last four years in the office, the BJP government has failed to carry out development works in the state. With just one year left for the assembly poll, they have shifted the entire blame on the former CM. This became evident when his name was removed from the list of star campaigners.” Dhasmana further said that the name of Dwarahat MLA Mahesh Negi – who is a rape accused – in the first list suggests the “frame of mind of the BJP as they preferred him over two former CMs and senior members”. Dhasmana added, “On one hand, Negi didn't not turn up in court hearings citing poor health and other reasons and on the other, he was available for the Salt assembly by-poll campaign.” Meanwhile, the BJP has downplayed the episode calling it a ‘minor printing error’. “With no issue left, the Congress has no other work rather than making baseless allegations. There was a minor mistake and we have issued an amended list, which has the names of the two former CMs,” said BJP state vice-president Devendra Bhasin. Besides the names of Rawat and Bahuguna, the revised list has party state in-charge Dushyant Kumar Gautam, CM Tirath Singh Rawat, state chief Madan Kaushik, Lok Sabha MPs, Rajya Sabha MPs, ministers and other senior leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/salt-by-poll-bjp-removes-rape-accused-mla-from-the-list-of-star-campaigners-after-controversy/articleshow/81857580.cms||Kautilya Singh

As per the official documents the parking facility will have a basement, stilt area, set back and open parking space with space to park nearly 170 cars and two wheelers. The duration of the contract will be of three years initially which can be extended further for one-or-two years, as per the decision of the UHUDA. However, the exact parking tariff is yet to be decided Rs 20 for four wheelers will be the minimum amount for a duration of 4 hours, while the monthly pass will be available at Rs 500 for the shopkeepers and frequent visitors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/multi-level-parking-to-come-up-in-dehradun/articleshow/81857665.cms||Abhijeet Singh

---||Bareilly||UP: Dalit man attacked by kin of ‘girl friend’, private parts crushed||BAREILLY: A Dalit man, Harendra Kumar, 22, was beaten up in his private parts and a rod allegedly inserted into his rectum while his attackers — the family of a girl from a higher caste who thought the two were involved — hurled caste abuses at him. This happened after midnight on Wednesday at Tikunia town in UP’s Lakhimpur Kheri district. Harendra is now battling for life at the district hospital. “He has been preparing for competitive exams and wakes up at 3am every day. On Wednesday, he had woken up before dawn and gone to an orchard. Brahmdeen (the girl’s father) and his three sons — Raju (21), Bharat (20) and Gajraj (18) — caught him, abused him for being from a lower caste and beat him up with an iron rod, baton and belts. Then, they inserted an iron rod into his rectum and repeatedly hit him in the private parts with the rod,” his cousin Anuj told TOI on Thursday. “They thought he was going to meet the girl. They treated him like he was not human.” The Nighasan tehsil, under which the Tikunia town lies, is an upper-caste dominated area with a 20% SC population. Harendra’s father is a marginal farmer there, with two bigha land. Harendra, after finishing his BA, had been working as an accountant at a local firm associated with a sugar mill and, at the same time, trying his luck at competitive exams. He is the youngest of three brothers and the only one in the family to have graduated. His two brothers, who work as labourers, had dropped out from school. Anuj did not want to go into the dynamics of the relationship Harendra shared with the girl. “Here, even a friendship is considered wrong. My brother was focused on his career and had decided to get married only after he cleared the exams,” he said. “But this had been a sore point. Their (Brahmdeen’s) family had an enmity with us over their objections to their friendship and had quarrelled with us on a few occasions.” Police said Harendra was "involved" with the girl. “After initial investigation, we came to know the victim is involved with the girl and was trying to meet her when he was caught and assaulted,” SHO of Tikunia police station Gyaan Singh told TOI. “But the accused said Harendra was trying to enter their house and steal something. We found out that was a lie. We will record Harendra’s statement when his condition improves.” On Thursday, Harendra could not speak and could not recognise any family member. Brahmdeen, Raju, Bharat and Gajraj, meanwhile, were booked under the SC/ST Act, and for voluntarily causing hurt and intentional insult. The three of them have been arrested, Lakhimpur Kheri SSP Vijay Dhull said. Gajraj is on the run. “A section for heinous crime will be added after the supplementary medical examination,” a police official said. Asked why the insertion of rod was not factored into the charges, SHO Singh said, “The family had not mentioned this in their complaint or we would have included the relevant section.” The medical examination, too, did not look for signs of insertion. “During the initial medico-legal examination, we were not informed about it. We will conduct a separate examination to legally verify the nature of injuries,” emergency medical officer of the district hospital, Satish Kumar, told TOI. “He has injuries on almost all parts of the body, including his private parts. He has been beaten up with batons and with bare hands. The injuries to his face and trachea were life-threatening, but he has responded to treatment."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/dalit-man-attacked-by-kin-of-girl-friend-private-parts-crushed-critical/articleshow/81854629.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Mumbai||High rise residents worry as spectre of a ‘sealing’ hangs over Mumbai city||Mumbai: Residents of Millenium Park in Mulund, a housing society comprising 14 buildings, believe they had a narrow escape recently. “Four from a family in our society tested positive, the fifth was the mother whose report fortunately came negative or else BMC would have sealed the entire building,” says Sanjay Gaonkar, who lives there. There are over 600 sealed buildings at present in the city, which means they are in lockdown—no one goes in or out, unless they get special permission. Even essential provisions can only be delivered at the gate. It’s a form of collective quarantine for 14 days, a dismal prospect that draws closer every time another of your neighbours tests positive. In Kandivali’s 21-storey Whispering Palms Cooperative Housing, resident Sameera Vakil coordinates between BMC and the society’s managing committee, negotiating for concessions when the spectre of such a shutdown looks imminent. She said last month there were seven cases in the C wing and BMC sealed it completely. “There was an exception made for pregnant women and doctors to step out. We did help out residents in the wing with daily essentials, but now with cases increasing rapidly there are worries again," said Vakil. To be fair, ward officers have mostly adopted a calibrated approach to the problem. In large housing complexes and high-rises where Covid-appropriate behaviour is adhered to, they prefer to seal off only floors or sections which are particularly vulnerable. “At the rate at which cases are rising, if we seal entirebuildings, we may have to do it all over the city. So we only seal floors in case of larger complexes even if they have over five cases," said a senior officer. The data bears out this claim. Close to 8,000 buildings in Mumbai have had one or more floors sealed, shows civic records, when a resident has tested positive. On the other hand, buildings entirely sealed are less than 10% of this number, and they largely constitute low-rise structures with narrow passages and stairs. In addition, 72 slum pockets and chawls have also been converted into containment zones. Bhavik Shah, a committee member of the 36-storey Marathon Era in Lower Parel, said societies must enforce responsible behaviour to ensure they do not face stringent action when cases rise. “We had over five and the floor was sealed, not the entire complex. But then we have been particular. Seating in the garden has been shut down, social gatherings banned and visitor entry is restricted to close family members,” he said. Ditto for 20-storied Raheja Heights Complex at Dindoshi. Jayant Shetty, society chairman, says, “BMC clarified that if there are five positive patients in the same flat the wing would not be sealed. Only if there are five across five different flats it would be sealed. As a society, we procured tapes and helped to seal flats and the adjoining elevator in case of there being a Covid patient. This is one way we are contributing to awareness on Covid discipline.” The challenge often lies in reining in recalcitrant residents. In a society on Napeansea Road, a driver who was asymptomatic was found to have spread the infection to service staff in the building. His employer chose not to inform neighbours about the man’s status, and this eventually led to the entire building being sealed. Such action can, however, have a crippling effect on the economy. “Staying locked in for two weeks, especially at a time when everyone is getting back to work, is scary. This past year has been bad, no one has savings that can last so long. It’s natural to want to try and revive business,” say Gaonkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/high-rise-residents-worry-as-spectre-of-a-sealing-hangs-over-mumbai-city/articleshow/81872009.cms||Richa Pinto

The parents’ bodies claim that they were already struggling to pay the existing fee and another hike will make it even more difficult. “We have even met the education secretary regarding this issue and have asked him to issue a strict order stating that schools can’t increase the fee yet. They are taking undue advantage of the situation,” said Arif Khan, president of the National Association for Parents and Students’ Rights (NAPSR). Meanwhile, the school managements have told TOI that the government hasn’t yet issued any order forbidding hike in fees and therefore, they are not violating any official directive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/parents-associations-complain-against-fee-hike-in-private-schools/articleshow/81857656.cms||Mohammad Anab

All five districts in the division have been suffering in the worst phase of the pandemic for the last one-and-a-half month. The effect the worrying situation has left was visible on Thursday, the first day of the vaccination drive for those above 45 years of age and suffering from no known co-morbid condition. Amravati division’s deputy director (Health Services) Dr Rajkumar Chavan told TOI that the vaccination drive received a rousing response across the division. “Administration in all five districts have taken some innovative initiatives to encourage people for vaccination. We will conduct record vaccination in the next few days,” said Dr Chavan. The vaccination data was being compiled till late Thursday night. In Yavatmal, district collector has issued directives to all government staffers above 45 years of age, and all of their family-members in the same age category to get vaccinated in the next seven days. The heads of the respective departments will ensure that all the eligible staffers have been vaccinated. District collectors in Yavatmal, Buldhana and Washim have asked shopkeepers and workers above 45 years of age to compulsorily take the jab by April 7. In Buldhana, the district collector has assured that market timings will be increased if all shopkeepers get themselves vaccinated. In Akola, district collector Jitendra Papalkar issued directives that all eligible citizens who visit Akola for marriage functions should be tested and vaccinated. In order to beat the age barrier, the local administrations have started creating different groups like bankers, postal staff, teachers, LPG delivery employees, and even NGOs. Those above 18 years of age in such groups are getting the jabs. This will increase the number of vaccinations in next two weeks. Maharashtra on Thursday reported a record jump in vaccinations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/45-age-group-line-up-at-vax-centres-in-amravati-division/articleshow/81860710.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Star hotel promoters booked by CBI for Rs 1,285 crore loan fraud||HYDERABAD: Golden Jubilee Hotels Private Limited, which owns Trident Hotel, and its directors were booked by the CBI in connection with an alleged Rs 1,285 crore bank loan fraud. An FIR was lodged on Wednesday against Golden Jubilee Hotels directors — Laxmi Narayan Sharma, Arjun Singh Oberoi, Neha Gambhir and Yashdeep Sharma — under IPC sections of cheating, criminal conspiracy and criminal misconduct. The CBI accused Golden Jubilee Hotels of diversion of funds in the construction and operation of the five-star luxuy hotel at Madhapur where former US president Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump had stayed during the Global Economic Summit in November 2017. The CBI booked the case based on a complaint by Bank of Baroda’s (BOB) corporate financial services branch at Himayatnagar. BOB is the lead bank of the consortium of seven banks which extended loans to Golden Jubilee Hotels. Core Hotel Ventures Private Ltd and East India Hotels (EIH) Limited have stake in Golden Jubilee Hotels. EIH Ltd, under the aegis of The Oberoi Group, operates hotels and cruisers under the luxury ‘Oberoi’ and five-star ‘Trident’ brands. In the FIR, the CBI said: “Golden Jubilee Hotels’ directors took financial credit limit from 2009 to 2015 by way of a term loan of Rs 679 crore and non-fund based limit of Rs 50 crore under a consortium arrangement led by BOB.” The investigating agency said the company had failed to maintain the time schedule of the hotel project, while the directors indulged in fraudulent trading, diverted funds and made transactions which were suspicious. “Golden Jubilee Hotels has not repaid instalments and the interest. The account was declared as a non-performing asset on December 3, 2015, with total dues accruing to Rs 1,285 crore. The borrower company and its directors entered into a criminal conspiracy with unidentified public servants of the bank and cheated BOB and other banks by diverting funds and utilising the loans for purposes other than for which they were granted,” the CBI alleged. Silki Sehgal, vice-president, corporate communications, The Oberoi Group, in an email reply to TOI said: “The FIR has just been brought to our attention and we are examining the contents.” A forensic audit report done by Ernst & Young has also found irregularities in transactions with related parties worth Rs 88 crore. It also found unsecured loan adjustment against capital and vendor balances totalling Rs 32 crore. Trident Hotel is a private-public participation project executed under a build-operate-transfer model. The project came up on a five-acre plot taken under lease from Telangana tourism department for 33 years. Trident Hotel (Tower 1), consisting of 323 rooms, became operational in September 2013 and is running with 60% occupancy. Golden Jubilee Hotels was established for constructing two five-star hotels — Hotel Trident and Hotel Oberoi. Subsequently, there was a change of plans. A business hotel with service apartments was to be constructed instead of Hotel Oberoi. However, the business hotel with service apartments (Tower 2), consisting of 322 rooms, is yet to commence its operations. The project has been stalled since 2015 due to an internal dispute between the company and the contractor. Also, arbitration proceedings between Golden Jubilee Hotels and its operators were reserved for orders in August 2017. Due to ongoing National Company Law Tribunal proceedings, the order has been kept on hold by the arbitration tribunal. Due to non-completion of service apartments, revenue for hotel operations was not able to meet the bank dues because of which it turned into an NPA, BOB said in its complaint to the CBI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/star-hotel-promoters-booked-by-cbi-for-rs-1285-cr-loan-fraud/articleshow/81864489.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Speaking to TOI, Nayab tehsildar Jaipal Rana said that based on the directions of the sub-divisional magistrate the team visited eight hotels in Mussoorie. “We made hoteliers aware that the visitors from 12 states having a high number of Covid-19 cases must be allowed accommodation only if they are carrying a valid RT-PCR report and that hoteliers must note down the report number,” Rana added. He said that the team told the hoteliers to follow all SOPs like maintaining social distancing, thermal scanning of all guests and providing masks as well as sanitisers. “We would conduct regular inspections in the hotels and in case any hotel is found to be violating these norms then action will be taken against them,” Rana said. However, reacting to these visits by officials several hoteliers said that RT-PCR reports must be checked at entry points of the state and that the onus of checking the reports must not be on hoteliers. Notably, the state government had issued an advisory of March 30 wherein it had advised travellers from 12 states — Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Rajasthan — to carry negative RT-PCR reports with test being conducted within 72 hours prior to their arrival in Uttarakhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/officials-visit-hotels-to-create-awareness-regarding-adherence-to-govt-advisory-on-visitors-from-12-states/articleshow/81857705.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Goa||Only 70% of iron ore finds takers at govt e-auction||Panaji: Only 70% of the iron ore lying at jetties and ports across the state found takers at the 25th e-auction held in March. Around 1 million tonnes of the 1.6 million tonnes of ore put up for e-auction by the directorate of mines and geology was purchased. Sources said that over 1 million tonnes of iron ore remains with the state government for e-auctioning. Due to low grade iron ore, around 6 lakh tonnes of iron ore was not purchased at the e-auction, sources said. Sources said that another reason for the subdued interest from buyers may be due to low demand for iron ore in the international market. The state government is conducting e-auction of iron ore to generate revenue for the state treasury which has been facing a crisis due to the Covid pandemic. In his budget speech, chief minister Pramod Sawant had announced the formation of a mining corporation as a route to e-auction mining leases in the state. Iron ore dumps are presently located at mines in Rivona, Collem, Advapal, Gavanem, Sonus Onvalim, Patiem/Tudou, Dignem, Pale, Bategal, Mina, Colomba/Sulcorna, Uguem, Shigao, and plants at Vagush, Tollem, besides Joleracho Dongor, Kotambi jetty, among others. TOI had reported in November last year that of the 3 million tonnes of iron ore that was to be e-auctioned, only 1.1 million tonnes was purchased in which 13 mining companies participated in the e-auction. With only 36.9% of the ore being sold, the revenue was not as per the state’s expectation. The previous e-auction held in May last year received a poor response largely because no mining company wanted to invest in the ore during the monsoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/only-70-of-iron-ore-finds-takers-at-govt-e-auction/articleshow/81860728.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

With this, the cumulative cases of the virus shot up to 1,00,911 in the Himalayan state. Also, two more coronavirus-related fatalities pushed the toll of the virus to 1,719 in the state. Among the two persons who died of Covid-related ailment on the day were a 65-year-old woman and a 31-year-old man. Among the new cases recorded on Thursday, the maximum of 236 were recorded in Dehradun, followed by Haridwar (149), Nainital (49), Udham Singh Nagar (22), Pauri (14) and Tehri (11). Among those who tested Covid-19 positive on the day was Aparna Dhaundiyal, ADM, Pauri. The Covid-19 test positivity rate in Dehradun has recorded at 6.69%. According to officials, a positivity rate above 5% indicates a high transmission of the virus with the region/district. Concerned with the rise in new Covid-19 cases, Anoop Nautiyal, member of Social Development for Communities Foundation, an organisation closely tracking the Covid-19 pandemic in the Himalayan state, said, “The last time Uttarakhand recorded more than 500 cases was on December 23, 2020.” He added, “I sincerely appeal to the CM to appoint a full-time health minister for Uttarakhand.

Students can score up to 15 marks for participating and excelling in extra-curricular activities during the year. In 2020, about 1.8 lakh of the 17.5 lakh students in Maharashtra have got grace marks, 32,007 of whom are from the Mumbai division. With almost no activities in 2020, though, students said their past performance must be considered. “There are no instructions yet on us being able to apply for the extra marks but the board exams are right around the corner. I have participated in dance competitions at the district and state level for three years. Just because there were no activities, we must not lose out on getting a chance for extra marks,” said Priya Sahai, a Class X student. Elementary and intermediate drawing examinations for 2020 had been cancelled too. State board chairperson Dinkar Patil said a decision can be expected soon. “Currently, the higher and technical education department has issued a directive that the elementaryand intermediate exams won’t be held but the school education directorate is yet to issue any orders. Similarly, the sports department has to issue directives, then the board can implement it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ssc-students-seek-2019-extra-curricular-marks/articleshow/81857826.cms||Vinamrata Borwankar
---||Goa||18 police inspectors move HC over direct hiring of DySPs||PANAJI: Eighteen police inspectors (PIs) of Goa police on Thursday approached the high court of Bombay at Goa to set aside the state government’s decision to fill deputy superintendent of police (DySP) posts, 50% through direct recruitment and 50% by promotions. Police officers have sought a direction from the high court to the state government to fill the DySP posts entirely through promotions. The state government has sanctioned 40 DySP posts to Goa police, out of which 21 are proposed to be filled by direct recruitment. All direct recruitment posts are vacant, whereas promotional posts have been filled. The police inspectors have prayed to the court to fill all 21 vacant DySP posts through promotions. In 1997, the state government had decided to fill the DySP posts through 80% promotion and 20% through direct recruitment. Later in 2011, the state government changed the decision and decided to make it 50:50% via direct and promotional filling of DySP vacancies. A senior police officer said that the Goa police had made many representations to the state government in the year 2004 and 2007 to make 100% recruitment of DySP posts through promotions. “But without taking Goa police into confidence, the state government decided to make it 50:50% via direct and through promotional filling of DySP vacancies,” a senior police officer said. A senior police officer said that in 2006, the apex court passed an order and directed the state government that promotions and service related to DySP below rank should be done by the Police Establishment Board. The officer said that even promotions of PI to DySP should be done through the Police Establishment Board, but as of now it has been done by the Department Promotional Board headed by the chairman of Goa Public Service Commission (GPSC). In 2007, special secretary (home) in a letter to the government had said that the Police Establishment Board should look into the promotions and service related issues of DySPS and ranks below, the officer said. “We have appealed to the high court to direct the state government to allow the Police Establishment Board to look into promotions of PI to DySP,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/18-police-inspectors-move-hc-over-direct-hiring-of-dysps/articleshow/81860809.cms||---

Police said that the accused, Bhupendra Jogidasani, had sodomized the boy on March 27. Jogidasani, who had retired from the human resources department of a chemical company a decade ago, had also molested the victim around three years back when he had gone to play at the accused’s house. The crime came to light when the boy complained to his parents about Jogidasani beating him. When the parents further asked him about the incident, the boy opened up and narrated the incident after which the heinous act of sodomy came to light. Jogidasani had also threatened the boy that he would hurt his mother if he told about the incident to anyone. The boy’s parents approached police and an offence was registered at JP Road police station on Wednesday. “We arrested the accused immediately after lodging the complaint. Post medical examination he was sent to judicial custody on Thursday,” said inspector B G Chetariya of JP Road police station. He added that the accused had retired from the human resources department of a chemical company around a decade ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/retd-hr-exec-held-for-sodomizing-6-yr-old/articleshow/81854588.cms||---

Soon after the fire was reported, police teams and fire tenders rushed to the spot to douse the fire and launched a rescue operation. Moradabad chief fire officer Mukesh Kumar said, “According to the details available with us, the unit had a license and was operating legally.

---||Nagpur||Audit of oxygen usage will be done: Collector||Nagpur: District collector Ravindra Thakare said on Thursday that audit of oxygen usage would be conducted by expert teams at hospitals in the backdrop of the shortage crisis hitting the city as the Covid spike has taken the administration by surprise. Though the official liquid oxygen stock in the district as on March 31 had a surplus of around 31 metric tonnes, the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) has projected the demand could fall short in the coming days. The number of beds in private and government hospitals are increasing along with the fast growth rate of the infection. On March 31, the medical sale of liquid oxygen was more than 182 metric tonnes out of total stock of around 246 metric tonnes. In information released by FDA, the agency has said around 114 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen could be made available in the district if all production plants operated round the clock. As against the production capacity, the demand as of now in the district has been estimated to be around 115 metric tonnes. Collector Thakare said misuse or overuse of oxygen by the hospitals cannot be ruled out and hence there is a need to audit the usage at the user end. “We have to ensure there is no mechanical fault like leaks or such faults along with overuse of oxygen at hospitals. Oxygen has become a scarce material now and hence the use has to be judicious and logical,” he said. Thakare added the civil surgeon and a team of FDA would be engaged for the audit. It’s learnt that apart from Nagpur district, places like Akola, Yavatmal, Washim and Nanded, which depend on the oxygen production here too have been affected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/audit-of-oxygen-usage-will-be-done-collector/articleshow/81860913.cms||Soumitra Bose

The first phase of the renovation of the astronomical observatory is on the brink of completion, making the observatory equipped with a plethora of facilities to little skygazers and amateur astronomers. “This is the first amateur observatory in India because in most parts of the country, there are professional observatories where only research is done and science centres with an astronomy cell. This one, however, will be completely dedicated towards astronomical interests where people can conduct research, carry out observations with the help of the equipment provided,” AFA president Satish Nayak said. At the tinkering lab, AFA intends to start a series of robotic workshops for students where they can build satellite models and build rovers. The team will also network with other observatories across the world with the help of AFA members at Goa University and the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) to source data gathered by some of the biggest telescopes. The AFA has tentatively proposed to inaugurate the renovated observatory on International Astronomy Day on May 15. The second phase of the renovation will be taken up following the inauguration. The renovation works were undertaken by Goa State Infrastructure Development Corportion and currently AFA is setting up the exhibits and interiors. The first phase of the observatory is expected to be fully completed by mid-April. “Though GSIDC take up mega works costing crores of rupees, ours was a small project of below Rs 50 lakh that was taken up by them. The observatory is in its 38th year and has become very popular among tourists, especially foreign visitors. The new facilities were much needed, as a result,” Nayak said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/revamped-amateur-observatory-at-panaji-to-open-its-doors-in-may/articleshow/81860889.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BJP given zero allocation from Rs 190cr Mayor’s fund||Mumbai: After being snubbed with ‘meagre’ allocation from the BMC standing committee’s kitty, the BJP on Thursday did not get even a single paisa from the Mayor’s fund. The civic general body amended the BMC budget and increased the Mayor’s fund to Rs 190 crore from Rs 50 crore of which Shiv Sena, which has 97 corporators, bagged the maximum of Rs 163 crore. The Congress, with 29 corporators, got Rs 9 crore; NCP, with eight corporators, got Rs 11 crore; and Samajwadi Party, which has six corporators, got Rs 4.75 crore. Corporators from other parties and independents got Rs 2.25 crore. BJP claimed that despite having 83 corporators, it was given zero allocation. “We have been cheated once again. The Mayor’s fund is not the private fund of the mayor. It is taxpayers’ money. The BJP’s 83 corporators have also been elected by the people of Mumbai and by not giving any money to BJP corporators, the mayor is doing injustice to these people,” claimed BJP corporator Vinod Mishra. The BJP was snubbed earlier when of the Rs 650 crore of funds passed by the civic standing committee, Sena bagged around Rs 340 crore, and BJP got Rs 143 crore. But mayor Kishori Pednekar, who is from Shiv Sena, said: “The BJP has already received Rs 143 crore from the standing committee. So we can’t give them double funds through the Mayor’s fund. I have given funds to all group leaders and also to all corporators who gave request letters for funds.” She further alleged: “When the BJP was in power in the state, it was giving funds only to BJP MLAs and not to legislators from other parties...” Standing committee chairperson Yashwant Jadhav from Sena said: “There is a convention that funds are distributed as per the corporator strength of each party. But there is no such rule when allotting standing panel and Mayor’s funds; they are given as per the discretion of the panel chairperson and mayor, respectively.” This year, the civic administration slashed the standing committee’s amendment fund in the budget to Rs 650 crore compared to last year’s Rs 750 crore. The panel sets aside funds for corporators for work in their constituencies and then the general body amends the budget further, which is known as Mayor’s fund. This also becomes part of a corporator’s development fund, but is distributed at the discretion of the mayor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-given-zero-allocation-from-rs-190cr-mayors-fund/articleshow/81863807.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Hyderabad||TRS MP’s driver, two others arrested in Delhi for extortion||HYDERABAD: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) sleuths on Thursday arrested three persons, including a driver of Mahabubabad Member of Parliament Maloth Kavitha (TRS), while accepting an alleged bribe of Rs 1 lakh in New Delhi. CBI has booked a case of extortion, criminal conspiracy and attempt to bribe a public official. CBI said the arrested accused Rajib Bhattacharya, Shubangi Gupta and driver Durgesh Kumar were caught taking bribe from one Manmeet Singh Lamba. The trio was caught at the official residence of MP Kavitha at Saraswati Apartments in New Delhi. CBI alleged that the three accused demanded Rs 5 lakh bribe to ensure Lamba’s under-construction house was not demolished. The accused had claimed that the construction did not meet many norms and that they would complain to the municipal authorities if they were not bribed. Finally, they settled for Rs 1 lakh. Rajib and Shubangi claimed they were PA and coordinator of the TRS MP, but Kavitha denied any links with them. CBI, after receiving a complaint from Lamba, a resident of New Delhi’s New Gupta Colony, laid a trap for the accused. Rajib introduced himself to Lamba as the MP’s PA and demanded bribe to influence officials of Municipal Corporation of Delhi to ensure they did not demolish the latter’s house. They also threatened that if issues were not settled and money not paid, they would ensure Lamba’s house was demolished. CBI apart from naming the accused also named ‘other unknown public servants’ as accused. TRS MP Kavitha told TOI, “CBI trap happened in the compound of Saraswati block. My quarter is in it. Durgesh Kumar, a native of Uttar Pradesh, is my car driver. I have given him the servant quarters. So, my quarter keys are also with him.” “I don’t have any personal assistants in Delhi. I don’t know the other two named by CBI. I manage things in Delhi through my PS and PA from Hyderabad and Mahabubabad. I don’t leave my car with Durgesh. The car is kept with a friend in Gurugram when I’m not in Delhi.” “Durgesh has been working with me for the past five to six months. I left Delhi after Parliament session on March 24. I am now in Karimnagar, currently returning from Kondagattu. The driver didn’t call me in the past few days. CBI also didn’t ask me anything so far,” the MP added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-mps-driver-2-others-arrested-in-delhi-for-extortion/articleshow/81864566.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Nagpur||With no cellphones or awareness, tribal belt far behind in vax drive||NAGPUR: In remote pockets of Melghat Hills, Covid vaccination remains a far cry due to lack of internet in the tribal belt. Without smart phones and net connectivity, the locals in far off villages of Melghat are not able to get themselves registered for vaccine shots. This is despite the fact that Harisal, a village in the area, is dubbed the state’s first digital village. Even reaching the vaccination centres from the villages deep down is a challenge, say officials here. Though Covid remains low in the area. Melghat, which comes under Amravati district, had been infamous for malnutrition. There is also a general reluctance about vaccination among tribals due to various reasons, which is keeping them away from the jabs, said local leaders. They also admitted that appeals, including that by MLA Rajkumar Patel, have failed. So far over 3,700 persons have been vaccinated. These largely include frontline workers, and only a handful are in the 60+ or 45+ with comorbidities bracket. Mitali Sethi, sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) for Dharni in Melghat, said there are nine vaccination centres in the area. “Connectivity is certainly an issue due to which locals are not getting access to the facility. Now, the idea is to bring people in groups to the centres and get them registered on the spot. The gram panchayats have been roped in and calls are being made in local weekly markets too,” she said. On the reluctance among locals, she said their concerns are just like any other person in urban areas. However, poverty is also a reason. Getting vaccinated means losing a day’s wages, she said. Dharni social activist Appa Patil said attempts are being made to create awareness among the people. The officials have been asked to hold drives in the villages and weekly markets. Dharni MLA Rajlkumar Patel said there has been poor response from interior pockets as locals have their own notions. “We have been making calls to villages. I had also released my own video to get vaccinated to build confidence. None of the measures helped,” he says. “The locals don’t believe that there is a pandemic at all. There have been no deaths in the area, which makes them confident. Even if they test positive they recover from the symptoms within 2 to 3 days and get back to normal routine,” he said. “No one has got vaccinated in our village. Maybe people have a different thinking. They are afraid of falling sick after getting vaccinated,” said Shriram Dharsimbhe of Gudga Bhadum, an interior village. The numbers are low yet positive cases are being reported in Melghat, though there are no deaths. One of the reasons locals are getting tested is because it is compulsory to cross over to nearby Madhya Pradesh. Due to its proximity, a number of locals travel to Madhya Pradesh, said a source in the health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/with-no-cellphones-or-awareness-tribal-belt-far-behind-in-vax-drive/articleshow/81860979.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Lucknow||Former LU prof, who took 1st shot, loses Covid battle||Lucknow: Covid-19 snatched yet another gem of the city on Thursday. Former head of Lucknow University’s zoology department and ex-controller of examination Prof AK Sharma (64), despite taking first dose of Covid vaccine on March 10, got infected a week later and died in a private hospital after battling with the virus for 11 days. He is survived by his wife and two daughters. According to Prof Sharma’s daughter Diksha, who teaches in National PG College, he experienced fever on March 21 and got himself tested on March 23 at a private diagnostic centre, where the RT-PCR test report then came negative. His family doctor later diagnosed pneumonia, but the condition did not improve despite medication. On doctor’s advice, on March 25, he went to a hospital in Gomtinagar, where the CT Scan report indicated that he might have Covid-19. He was then admitted to ICU in a private Covid hospital in Gomtinagar where a second RT-PCR test on March 28 found him positive. He died on Thursday due to respiratory failure due to double pneumonia. Doctors said that he also had diabetes and hypertension. Prof Sharma’s colleagues in LU were shocked to learn about his demise and held the false Covid negative test report on March 23 that led to late diagnosis responsible for the unfortunate event. “He used to follow Covid precautions religiously and stepped out of his house after a long gap to take the vaccine jab. Thereafter, he might have felt a bit secured and came to campus for his pension related work when he caught infection”, said a colleague. Prof Sharma is the third LU professor to have succumbed to Covid-19 in the past six months after former head Botany Prof Dinesh Kumar (73) and professor of applied economics Prof VK Goswami (52). Apart from their contribution in science, Prof Sharma and Prof Kumar also have the credit of starting the institute of mass communication in science and technology, a unique initiative taken way back in 2000 and successfully running it for 20 years, producing many journalists. The loss of the two personalities sent a wave of sorrow among teachers and students. The varsity mourned the death of Prof Sharma who was amongst the few protozoologists in UP. Students described Prof Sharma as soft-spoken and a brilliant academician. The zoology department held an online condolence meet to pay tribute to the departed soul. “It’s a great loss for the entire academic fraternity. Prof Sharma published around 80 research papers in national and international journals, besides supervising 20 PhDs and authoring two books in his 33 years career before retiring from services in 2019,” said Prof Omkar of the zoology department. “Prof Sharma did his PhD in 1982 under renowned proto zoologist Dr. BN Singh of Central Drug Research Institute and joined LU as a faculty in 1986. He was recipient of several prestigious awards for his research in science communication and environment protection,” said Prof Amita Kanaujia of zoology department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/former-lu-prof-who-took-1st-shot-loses-covid-battle/articleshow/81863814.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Surat||International fliers have harrowing time in Surat||Surat: The baggage claim area and arrival lobby for international fliers at the Surat Airport witnessed chaotic scenes early on Thursday morning. The passengers arriving from Sharjah, the only international flight operating from Surat at present went through harrowing experience as they had to wait for hours in the long queues before being able to check out of the airport. The lack of proper planning and mismanagement was evident everywhere as social distancing norms and other Covid-19 guidelines went for a toss in the ensuing chaos. The issue also reverberated on different social media platforms during the day. The airport officials claimed that chaos resulted due to space crunch as well as the testing of the travellers as per mandatory Covid19 guidelines. Later, airport director Aman Saini held meetings with officials to find out a solution to the issue. It should be noted this was only the second flight since the Surat-Sharjah operations resumed on March 28 after a gap of over a year. A total of 168 passengers landed at the city airport from Sharjah and many of them struggled to even collect their luggage from the conveyer belt since there was a long queue for customs clearance. Many passengers complained that there were not enough trollies and there was a gross violation of the social distancing norms. Many also complained that the police notification, about restriction on gathering of more than four people at one spot, too was violated. “Passengers had to struggle to collect luggage and there was a huge queue as the customs clearance desk was set up near the conveyer belt. There was no social distancing and all other Covid-19 appropriate norms were violated,” said Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/international-fliers-have-harrowing-time-in-surat/articleshow/81854918.cms||---

The accused, Indrapal Kushwaha, 35, was a family friend of her husband Ramkrishna Kushwaha and often used to visit their house, said police.

A few hours later, around 10.30 pm, Indrapal returned inebriated and shot the couple from point-blank range and fled the scene, said police. Kheri SSP Vijay Dhull has formed multiple teams to nab the accused. Mohammadi police station SHO Brijesh Tripathi told TOI, “The accused first shot the woman in her head and then shot her husband from point-blank range. Locals heard gunshots but couldn’t gather the courage to nab him. The murders are the result of an illicit relationship. We have registered an FIR under section 302 (murder) of the IPC.

---||Mumbai||BMC revokes provisional OC granted to Sunrise Hospital in Mumbai||Mumbai: The BMC on Thursday revoked the provisional Occupation Certificate (OC) granted to Bhandup’s Sunrise Hospital last year to run as a Covid hospital. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal issued the order following a report from the civic building proposal (BP) department stating that the hospital located inside Dream Malls had failed to comply with the conditions mentioned in the provisional OC. Chahal also directed that no new permissions must be granted to the hospital without “full and final compliances” from all departments. “From the report submitted, it can be seen that compliances are pending and there is also violation of FSI. Hence, it is not advisable to continue the provisional OC,” chief engineer of BP department Vinod Chitore stated in his note submitted to Chahal. The BMC upheld the report submitted by the BP department which had raised a red flag in August 2020 stating that the grant of provisional OC to Sunrise must be reviewed and that it wasn’t proper to de-link the irregularities of Dreams Mall from the hospital. On Wednesday, opposition corporators in the civic standing committee had hit out at then BMC chief Praveen Pardeshi for granting the provisional OC and Chahal for ignoring the BP department’s report. They had demanded a judicial probe by a principal secretary rank officer, instead of deputy municipal commissioner Prabhat Rahangdale, into the fatal fire at Dreams Mall on March 26. Over 70 patients were rescued and 11 bodies were found. While the BMC has revoked Sunrise Hospital’s provisional OC, the state government has not initiated any probe so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-revokes-provisional-oc-granted-to-sunrise-hospital-in-mumbai/articleshow/81864622.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The body of resident doctors alleged despite bringing it to the notice of respective college administrations, no concrete steps have been taken. “Government medical colleges in Maharashtra are facing a scarcity of drugs and other items such as gloves, syringes and dressing material, which are essential to provide basic healthcare to patients,” MARD said in a statement released to the media on Thursday. They said it was shameful on the part of doctors to ask poor patients to buy such basic items. “Imposing such out-of-pocket expenditure has a larger impact on their lives.”  A MARD member said even Mumbai’s civic hospitals such as Sion and KEM have these shortages. Only colleges in Latur and B J Medical in Pune had the supplies, they added. Dr T P Lahane, head, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), said the state has already placed a Rs 153 crore order for procurement of drugs and consumables. “The consignment is ready.

---||Rajkot||Passengers refuse to pay for RT-PCR at Rajkot airport||Rajkot: On the first day of Covid-negative certificates being made mandatory for those entering Gujarat from other states, chaos reigned at Rajkot airport. Nearly 20 passengers who arrived from Delhi, without the certificates, refused to pay for the RT-PCR test at the airport. Even as the airport officials and passengers argued about this for two hours, there was no clarity among authorities as to who was responsible for checking RT-PCR certificates and conducting the tests. While the airport authorities believed it was the job of the Rajkot Municipal Corporation, the civic body claimed the airport authorities needed to take responsibility for this. Rajkot Airport director Digant Borah said, “Civic officials came and solved the issue on the first day. However, they have deployed their team temporarily for a couple of days. We cannot tie up with any private party to get passengers tested. This should be done by the state government.” RMC health officer Lalit Vaja said, “The passengers said they cannot afford to pay for the tests, so we conducted it for free. However, we have made it clear to both the railway and airport authorities that no RT-PCR certificate means no entry into the city. If a person does not have the certificate, then we will make them pay for the test. It is the responsibility of airports, airlines, and railway authorities to follow the guidelines.” Abhinav Jeph, WR senior divisional commercial manager, said, “As per a meeting held at the collector’s office, it is RMC’s responsibility to verify the certificates and conduct tests if required.” However, municipal commissioner Udit Agrawal said this is the responsibility of railway and airport authorities. “However, if any person enters the city without test, we will be the ones to be affected. So, we will station our teams at the railway station and airport. They will check every passenger. If someone without the certificate tries to enter the city, we wil spring into action. We have tied up with private laboratories, and the person will have to pay for the test.” RMC will quarantine the person at home. If the traveller does not have a home in Rajkot, s/he will be shifted to a quarantine facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/passengers-refuse-to-pay-for-rt-pcr-at-rajkot-airport/articleshow/81855060.cms||---

The FOMO (fear of missing out) factor following the surge over the week made many rush for vaccine. This included healthcare and frontline workers who were earlier reluctant to take the shots. As a result of this overwhelming response, 12,500 people got shots at 149 centres—73 government and 76 private. The beneficiaries included 7,290 senior citizens aged 60 years or above and 4,256 in the 45-59 age group. Many among them had come for the second shot of the two-dose vaccine course. Around 1,039 healthcare and 939 frontline workers had also turned up. The huge turnout also led to overcrowding at the centres, pushing social distancing to the corner. Beneficiaries also had to wait for hours for the jab. At KGMU, 61-year-old Rajendra Kumar Singh said, “It’s no use getting pre-registered if you have to wait for hours and see on-site registration getting preference”. At TB hospital, Chowk resident Sundar Lal (46) said, “Despite being diabetic, my doctor was not ready to issue a certificate to me. But now, thanks to the government for removing the clause, I got the jab.” State BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh, ministers Brijesh Pathak and Suresh Rana, chief secretary RK Tiwari and additional chief secretary SP Goyal took their first dosage along with their spouses at SPM Civil hospital. A resident of Gomtinagar, Swadesh Kumar (48) complained about missing signboards at Civil Hospital that wasted a lot of time. At a private hospital, Sachi Srivastava (51), a healthcare worker, said, “Since Covid cases are rising again, I decided to get vaccinated at the earliest. Earlier, I had avoided getting the jab as the pandemic was declining.” CMO office spokesperson Yogesh Raghuvanshi said, “No report of side-effects of the vaccine has come in from anywhere.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-protocols-go-for-a-toss-amid-fear-of-missing-out-vax/articleshow/81863839.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Nagpur||Concerned over academic loss, resident doctors threaten to stop Covid services||Nagpur: Resident doctors from government medical colleges in Maharashtra have threatened to first stop non-Covid services, followed by Covid services in the later phase if the state government “continues to ignore their concerns regarding academics”. “Alternate arrangements must be made. NMC and the state government should be making arrangements for Covid facilities outside of the teaching hospitals as well. Patient care should not suffer. In the same way, education of future specialists of this country should not be affected,” reads a note released by the Central Committee of Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors. TOI had reported about their concern on March 22 when resident doctors in Nagpur has stated that they are feeling exhausted and academically lost. “GMCs are supposed to be centres of learning where patients get the highest standard of care, and medical postgraduate students are trained to be future specialists. However, because the government is unable to come up with a response system for Covid inspite of the experience of last one year, future doctors as well as non-Covid patients are suffering,” said Dr Arpit Dhakate, president of MARD at GMCH, Nagpur. “The PG training is being irreversibly hampered due to repeated shift in Covid wards,” said Dr Rajat Agrawal, MARD president at IGGMCH. “We have a training period of three years to become a competent specialist doctor. More than one-third of that time has been spent working in Covid wards. If this continues, we are afraid we won’t have the necessary skills and competency needed by the end of our training period,” he said. “We are supposed to be here to be trained in our respective fields but we are being shunted to fill the gaps in our public health system. All resident doctors irrespective of their specialities have been working in Covid wards instead of their own departments,” he said. To add insult to injury, these doctors who have been at the frontline against the pandemic have received no exemption in the fees to be paid for the academic year. In Mumbai, the doctors working in BMC-run state medical colleges get hefty Covid incentives but doctors in all other GMCs are deprived of it. Residents have also demanded exemption from thesis submission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/concerned-over-academic-loss-resident-doctors-threaten-to-stop-covid-services/articleshow/81861204.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||India||Covid situation grim, we’re staring at another full-blown crisis: AIIMS chief Randeep Guleria||NEW DELHI: The Covid-19 situation in India will turn into a full-blown crisis if strict adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour isn’t ensured, Dr Randeep Guleria, the director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, has warned. Dr Guleria, who is also a member of the national taskforce for Covid-19 management, said that people weren’t wearing masks or maintaining social distance even though the daily cases continue to rise sharply. Read AlsoCovid virus may be getting more infectious, less lethalAn analysis of Covid-19 cases and deaths in the ongoing second wave in India suggests that the virus maybe getting more infectious but less lethal – a course that many experts and epidemiologists had earlier anticipated. The analysis by TOI compared the ongoing wave with the earlier phase ofCoronavirus in India: Live updates“It took several months for the Covid-19 tally in the country to cross the 70,000-mark during the first wave. This time around, we are seeing a very steep curve,” the AIIMS director said. A similar situation is being witnessed in the national capital, he added. Till about a month ago, Delhi was recording 130 to 140 cases daily. However, in the last one week, the daily tally has increased 10 times. On Thursday, the city recorded 2,790 new cases—highest in over three months. The number of cumulative cases stood at 6,65,220.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Dr Guleria said that presence of mutated strains of the virus that causes Covid-19, most importantly the UK strain, which has high transmissibility, is an important factor behind the sudden surge. However, he added, the lack of Covid-appropriate behaviour — wearing masks in public places, social distancing and washing hands regularly — was the main reason. Read AlsoSecond Covid wave may peak by April 20, say scientistsScientists working on a mathematical model to examine the Covid-19 spread forecast that the current second wave will peak somewhere between April 15-20 and the number of ‘active’ symptomatic cases would hit a high roughly a week later at the same level of around 10 lakh cases the country had seen in“People have developed a fatigue to the situation. They want to go out, party and travel even though the cases are rising. One of the reasons behind this is that this time around the young are more affected and the severity of symptoms among them is lesser. However, we must realise that eventually the young may spread the infection to the elderly people and those with comorbidities and we might witness overwhelming healthcare infrastructure once again,” Dr Guleria said. Read AlsoExplained in 10 charts: How India's second Covid wave is more severe, different than firstThe second wave of coronavirus in India is spreading rapidly and is expected to get worse. The recent surge in cases is happening at a pace more rapid than seen during the first wave of the virus. The number of cases is likely to rise further in the wake of relaxed restrictions, festive season andHe stressed on the need to vaccinate people against Covid-19 at a faster pace and bring back the focus on testing, tracking, isolation and treating persons who are found positive for the disease. “It may not be feasible to impose lockdown again. But, if necessary, there should be some restriction on non-essential travel,” the AIIMS director said. He added that in areas where there is a cluster of new cases, micro-containment zones may be created to prevent disease spread. “If we don’t control the situation now, it may get difficult to deal with its effects at a later stage. Hospitals may get flooded with requests for admissions. Already, we are seeing 200% rise in requests for Covid-19 beds in Delhi,” added Dr Guleria. Non-Covid patients may also get affected if the healthcare infrastructure and manpower remain occupied with Covid-19 leading to more problems and deaths, doctors warn.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/situation-grim-were-staring-at-another-full-blown-crisis-guleria/articleshow/81865825.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Each team will have two cops and one SMC officer and they will check 10-15 zones every day.The decision was taken after meeting between SMC officials and city police on Wednesday at the police commissionerate. Officers from both the departments discussed various issues related to violations and implementation of guidelines. All those found violating the containment and Covid-19 rules will face police complaint.“Over 1700 micro containment zones have been declared in the city and the numbers are changing daily. These teams will visit 10 to 15 of them daily and the exercise will be repeated at regular intervals,” said an SMC official. SMC officials do keep checking the containment zones but in many cases, strict implementation is proving to be a challenge. It came to the knowledge of health officials that residents of the containment zone often venture out despite prohibitory orders. “Now offence will be registered against such individuals,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/containment-zones-50-teams-to-keep-eye/articleshow/81855128.cms||---

The funds raised will be used to expand TruJet’s operations pan-India and explore newer opportunities in the civil aviation sector, Interups Inc chairman Laxmi Prasad and Megha Engineering & Infrastructures Ltd (MEIL) group director KV Pradeep said in a joint statement. However, neither Interups Inc nor MEIL which owns Turbo Megha Airways, disclosed the quantum of FDI the deal entails. “We will finalise the exact final amount at a later stage,” they said. With this deal, Hyderabad-based MEIL’s stake in Turbo Megha Airways comes down to 51%. TruJet currently operates flights to 21 destinations, including tier-2 cities, under the UDAN scheme with a fleet of seven ATR aircraft. These include destinations like Hyderabad, Mumbai, Aurangabad, Chennai, Goa, Bangalore, Tirupati, Vijayawada, Kadapa, Rajahmundry, Ahmedabad, Porbandar, Jaisalmer, Nashik, Jalgaon, Cooch Behar, Buranpur, Tezu, Mysore, Bidar, Belagavi, Vidyanagar, among others. A consortium led by Interups Inc was one of the bidders for ailing national carrier Air India as well. Interups, which is headed by NRI chartered accountant Laxmi Prasad, had submitted an expression of interest for the airline along with 209 Air India employees but had later pulled out of the race. TruJet has ferried over 28 lakh passengers to different parts of the country since its inception in July 2015.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/us-co-buys-49-stake-in-trujet-airlines/articleshow/81864672.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Nagpur||District records 60 Covid deaths, likely 2nd highest in country after Pune||NAGPUR: Sixty Covid patients died in the district on Thursday, which is probably the second highest figure among all districts in the country, after Pune with 65 deaths. Late hospitalization, severe infection probably due to mutated variants, and shortage of beds are the reasons behind rise in fatalities, said doctors and activists. As per data of state’s public health department (PHD), 35 deaths were reported in Aurangabad district for the third highest figure on Thursday. Fatalities in Nagpur district are higher than Mumbai (19) despite fewer cases here. There were 3,696 cases in Nagpur district as per PHD, 9,706 in Mumbai district, and 8,025 in Pune district. Of total 60 deaths in the district, 35 deceased were residents of the city, 21 from rural areas and four from other districts who tested positive and died in hospitals in the district. The number of fatalities on Thursday was highest in a day in the second wave, which hit from third week of February. Sixty deaths have been recorded on a single day in the district after 196 days. This is the third time the district has witnessed 60 deaths on a day, after 62 on September 16, and 64 on September 17 last year. IGGMCH deputy medical superintendent Dr Sagar Pande told TOI, “Deaths are on the rise as majority of positive patients are getting admitted in hospital after becoming critical in home isolation. Our analysis reveals majority of patients are coming to hospital when oxygen saturation level drops below 50. Also, some deceased were admitted in critical condition as made they rounds of private hospitals and did not get beds there.” Consultant physician and intensivist Dr Nikhil Balankhe and infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde believe deaths are on rise due to high number of cases. Infection in patients are higher in second wave compared to first one, they both said. “HR-CT score of majority of patients irrespective of age is high, which was not seen last year. It may be due to mutation in variants. Patients are requiring more time to recover in hospitals this time. Last year, around 1% of discharged patients used to return to hospitals with rise in infection. This time the ratio is over 10%,” they said. Activist Joseph George blamed the administration for rise in deaths. “Number of fatalities is high in the district compared to other districts, even Mumbai and Pune. This is due to shortage of beds here. Patients require oxygen and treatment in crucial timing, and that is passing away in search of beds. GMCH was supposed to make available 1,000 beds in October last year, but it still has only 608 beds as on Thursday. GMCH was supposed to increase 30 beds daily, but it has added only eight beds in last 4 days. Proper inquiry should be conducted into deaths to ascertain exact reason and action should be taken,” he said. As per data of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), 273 beds (Oxygen 231, ICU 33 and ventilators 9) were vacant in the city in evening on Thursday. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said, “NMC started Dedicated Covid Health Centre (DCHC) with 72 beds at Pachpaoli Hospital. It will ease burden on GMCH and IGGMCH. Patients from GMCH and IGGMCH will be shifted to Pachpaoli after becoming stable. It will help accommodate other high symptomatic patients in GMCH and IGGMCH. NMC has facilitated 110 beds at Indira Gandhi Rugnalaya, 40 at Ayush Hospital at Sadar, and 32 at Isolation Hospital.” The district had recorded 763 fatalities in March, which was more than all months, excluding August (919) and September (1,465) last year. The case fatality rate was 1% in March , which was less than all last 12 months. It was the result of high number (76,250) cases in March, which was the highest in all months in the year-long pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/district-records-60-covid-deaths-likely-2nd-highest-in-country-after-pune/articleshow/81860780.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

In the last 24 hours, cases touched 887. The last time so many cases were reported were in August-September 2020. In view of the spurt of cases, health minister Eatala Rajender conducted a video conference with health officials and assessed the vaccine drive as well. The cumulative caseload reached 3.08 lakh with four more deaths reported on Thursday, taking the toll to 1,701. The minister instructed officials to make sure that there is enough supply of medicines, PPE kits, N95 masks, liquid oxygen tanks, bulk cylinders and tablets. He also said there must be enough manpower including doctors and other staff. Officials were instructed to observe all fever-related cases. “Vaccination is the only way to break the chain of virus. We appeal to people to take vaccine doses. Vaccination will be made available at Primary Health Care Centres (PHC). Social distance measures have to be maintained,” Rajender said. In the city, experts explained that this time more number of children and very young people are getting infected as seen in neighbouring Karnataka. “There was anticipation of this in that state and closing down schools was a good decision considering a cluster of cases being reported,” Dr Subodh said. Officials also observed that Hyderabad being the centre of business activity there is a large influx of people from other states. “This is the reason why we are advising people to be more cautious,” a health official said. Meanwhile, Banjara Hills police station is facing the brunt of the virus again with five people testing positive, including one home guard and four police personnel. Last year, 56 people tested positive from the same police station. One person had also succumbed to virus. More worrisome is the trend in districts, where cases are increasing fast. Nirmal district, which reported almost zero cases few days ago reported 78 cases in last 24 hours. In Siripur village of Jagityal district, 27 people — all related — tested positive. This followed many people attending a funeral. After one person was tested, officials tested 37, and 27 results came positive. Jagityal, Nizamabad and Nirmal districts are seeing more cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/200-case-spike-every-day-health-min-takes-stock/articleshow/81861305.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The survey of 100-plus companies also shows a reduced level of optimism about the expected timeframe for recovery, compared to February. While 51% of the surveyed firms in February said their operations were back at pre-pandemic levels, only 48% reported the same in the latest survey. Around 33% of the respondents said they expect the recovery to take three to six months, up from 29% in February. Employment levels also largely remained flat. Around 74% MSMEs said they were back at pre-pandemic levels of output. MCCIA attributed the stalled recovery to recent Covid-19 surge, mixed messaging, and fears of another lockdown. “Uncertainties in the market always impact business. We request the government not to impose a lockdown,” MCCIa director-general Prashant Girbane said. “Increased vaccination would boost confidence and, even contact-based services would start contributing to the recovery. Through Pune Platform for Covid Response, we are taking all possible steps to promote Covid-appropriate behaviour and push for 1 lakh vaccinations per day,” MCCI president Sudhir Mehta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lockdown-fears-slow-down-economic-recovery-mccia/articleshow/81858029.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Mumbai||GR on guardian min role in panchayats quashed in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Holding that free and fair elections are the hallmark of democracy, the Bombay high court on Thursday set aside a July 2020 decision of the state government that allowed the guardian minister to be consulted in appointments of administrators to gram panchayats pending elections to the local self-governing bodies. The HC noted that now, elections have already been held in many gram panchayats. “The constitutional scheme envisaged the Panchayat Raj and high degree of autonomy to the gram panchayats. The sheer magnitude of large number of gram panchayats and their importance in a democratic set-up is a good reason why any political dispensation would be eager to gain control and extend its hold over the gram panchayats,” said a bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik. The issue of gram panchayats landed in court after a bunch of petitions challenged the ordinance amending the Maharashtra Village Panchayat Act to provide for administrators since elections were difficult to be held due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the GR issued in July last year enabling chief executive officers of zilla parishads to consult district guardian ministers and appoint administrators to almost 14,000 gram panchayats whose terms expired or were due to expire soon. The HC noted that “the entire object of appointing an independent administrator is to ensure impartiality in election process” and added, “Any possibility of appointing an administrator who is likely to act in furtherance of the political agenda and thereby aid the ruling dispensation to get an unfair advantage in the elections needs to be avoided.” Counsel Shyam Dewani, S B Talekar and G S Godbole, appearing for petitioners who challenged the validity of the GR, said such intervention “would defeat the constitutional scheme of free and fair elections.” The guardian minister is empowered to oversee combined budgets of all local civic bodies and their implementation, besides facilitating “land acquisition for mega projects like garbage processing plants, construction of highways, airports, industrial area, water supply and sewage treatment projects,” observed the HC order. The CEO, though appointed by the state, is a statutory authority, duty-bound to follow the Zilla Parishad Act and rules. “It is necessary that the CEO should have a free hand in the appointment of an administrator without a semblance of any political influence,” held the HC, but clarified that it was “not for a moment” suggesting that in every case, the guardian minister would influence the decision of the CEO. The HC said “holding free and fair elections in a democracy is of paramount importance,” and the state must do everything necessary to cooperate with the mandate of the state election commission. The SEC too objected to the GR. It was “imperative’’ the CEO exercised his power to appoint an administrator sans any advice of the minister, said SEC counsel Ajit Kadethankar. The HC said the SEC stand “deserves to be accepted.” “The petitions therefore succeed. The impugned GR dated 13th July, 2020...is quashed and set aside,” the HC directed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/gr-on-guardian-min-role-in-panchayats-quashed-in-mumbai/articleshow/81864679.cms||---

Locals said early on Thursday, two trees opposite Mahalaxmi racecourse were cut down. Joaquim Dcosta, who runs Race View restaurant, said, “On Wednesday evening, when I left for my Borivli home, the trees were standing. On Thursday morning, I saw they were felled.” Advocate Godfrey Pimenta said that the environmental destruction being done by the cutting of full-grown trees is irreversible and irreparable. “This should not have been allowed in larger public interest,” he added. Of the 199 trees that will be cut, 46 will be transplanted. A civic official said that permission was already granted by tree authority after which the tree-felling work was taken up. Trees in three civic wards—D (Tardeo), E (Byculla) and G-South (Lower Parel)—will be affected by the two cable-stayed ROBs that are being built at a cost of around Rs 745 crore. —Richa Pinto||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-starts-axing-199-trees-for-two-robs-at-mahalaxmi-in-mumbai/articleshow/81863855.cms||Richa Pinto

Nithyanantham borrowed money from S Ramadoss, a doctor, to meet his family and business expenses. Ramadoss had lodged a false complaint before the inspector of DCB stating that the petitioner received Rs 1.50 crore from him promising the latter that he would secure a government job for his daughter-in-law.The petitioner was called for inquiry and harassed by the police and was also forced to sign a compromise deed in June 2020, which was pre-drafted to suit the convenience of Ramadoss. Though the petitioner submitted a representation to the superintendent of police (SP) in this regard, it did not evoke any response. Hence, he moved the HC Madurai bench.Taking into account the submissions of counsel for the petitioner, P Chandrasekaran and the status report submitted by the police, justice Hemalatha observed that the function of resolving civil disputes is entrusted to the judiciary and the police officers lack jurisdiction in civil cases.The judge observed that the inspector without registering Ramadoss’ complaint under Section 154 (1) of the CrPC has literally done a ‘katta panchayat’ at the police station. “In a country suffering the scourge of the world’s largest backlog of cases, litigants often view criminal proceedings as a tool to pressurize and threaten the other party to enter a favourable settlement,” observed the judge.Quashing the compromise deed, the judge observed that the court views the acts of the SP and inspector with utmost disfavour and directed the DGP to initiate disciplinary action against the inspector to ensure that it acts as a deterrent for any police official who breaks the law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-orders-action-against-cop-for-holding-katta-panchayat/articleshow/81863857.cms||Kaushik Kannan

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Nursing staff crunch may hit Covid fight||HYDERABAD: While the Telangana government is gearing up to add more hospital beds and other infrastructure facilities to fight the rise in Covid cases, the dearth in nursing staff may come as a major roadblock. In the Assembly last year, state health minister Eatala Rajender said there were 7,743 sanctioned posts for nursing staff, and 3,043 of these were vacant. Officials confirmed the situation was the same even now. To meet the shortfall, the state government employed about 688 staff on contract basis last year.  With many cases being reported at private hospitals, there too about 3500 staff members were recruited. So tough was the situation, that at one point corporate hospitals were even paying Rs 3,000 a day for additional staff hires. The dearth was exacerbated as trained nurses left to their villages fearing the virus. Meanwhile, several others left after the cases dropped. The demand for nurses in small and medium hospitals is about 30 to 100, big hospitals need up to 800. With a second wave looming in the state, hospitals are now looking for additional staff. Nurses in the Intense Care Unit (ICU) get more than Rs 18,000 a month, other nurses around Rs 14,000. Staff engaged in other work around the hopsital, with one year experience, get paid Rs 15,000. “Slowly the work load is increasing. More patients are coming in which means there will be more recruitment,” said K Jaya, a nurse working on contract basis in a private hospital. Each nurse at times has to attended to more than six patients. They often do not even have time to change their PPE kits and they are at greater risk than doctors, she said.

These included BKU (Ekta Sidhupur) Muktsar district president Sukhdev Singh. Meanwhile, three farmers, out of four arrested by police on Sunday, were also granted bail and released from jail. Earlier in the day, farmers, led by BKU (Ekta Sidhupur) state president Jagjit Singh Dallewal assembled at Guru Nanak Dev Chowk in Malout and after addressing the protesters, surrendered to the police. They were taken to Malout police station in two police vehicles. Police had arrested Surjit Singh, Nem Pal Singh and Baldev Singh of Bodhiwala village and Gurmeet Singh of Khunan Kalan village on March 28. Barring Gurmeet, the other three got bail. Sources said police and the farm organisation had reached an understanding wherein the main farm leaders, who were at the spot on March 27, when the Abohar MLA was assaulted, would be taken into custody and police would not oppose bail of the three arrested in the court. Dallewal met senior police officials earlier in the day, before 17 farmers presented themselves for surrender. “Some of those who have surrendered may not be wanted in the case and are district-level functionaries of the organisation. The leaders wanted to show a way to the farm activists by presenting themselves for arrest. They wanted to tell the cadre that going to jail for a bigger cause should not be seen in bad light, as the bigger cause before us at present is to strengthen the protest on the borders of Delhi. The BJP wanted farmers to be involved in cases in Punjab so that they do not reach the Delhi borders and the onging protests against the three contentious farm laws is weakened. But we have asked the leaders to present themselves for arrest and asked others to reach the Delhi borders and also take care of their crops,” said Dallewal. “We have ensured that the three arrested, who are innocent, get out of jail on bail,” he added. Faridkot range inspector general of police Kaustubh Sharma said, “Some persons have surrendered in the case and three have got bail. Those who have surrendered will be duly tested for Covid-19 and protocol will be followed in presenting them in the court.” Muktsar SP investigations Rajpal Singh said the 17 who surrendered “will be presented before the judicial officer for remand”. A large number of farmers had allegedly thrashed Narang and even torn his clothes when he had come to Malout to hold a press conference. The police had registered a case under various sections, including attempt to murder charges, against more than 300 persons on the complaint of Muktsar SP (Headquarters) Gurmail Singh, who had sustained injuries in the attack on the MLA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mla-assault-17-farmers-surrender-3-arrested-earlier-get-bail/articleshow/81861403.cms||Neel Kamal

While the university had given the responsibility of conducting exams to clusters and colleges, this is the first time an attempt is being made to bring in uniformity in the examination process amid the pandemic, at least for some courses. The exam schedule for professional courses was also released on Thursday. While postgraduate exams are scheduled from May 25, exams for professional courses will extend till August, especially for first-year students. Question banks will be given for semesters II and IV of all postgraduate arts, science and commerce courses, for final semesters of BE (VIII) and B Pharm (VIII) and for semester IV of MMS. Vinod Patil, director (Board of Examinations and Evaluations), MU, said the decision was taken by the examination board, but he didn’t say why it was only for a few courses. “Online exams are losing credibility. Most students are scoring exceptional marks and several have found ways to trick the system. This move is to probably show the industry that the sanctity of exam is retained to some extent,” said a principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/colleges-to-get-question-banks-from-mu-for-final-year-exams-in-mumbai/articleshow/81864737.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Hyderabad||Revenge? Realtor killed on Hyderabad road||HYDERABAD: A real estate businessman was hacked to death in broad daylight by unknown assailants in Mailardevpally on Thursday, the latest in a series of similar killings across Hyderabad over the past two years. Police said that businessman, Asad Khan (50), was riding a motorbike with pillion rider Nazar when four men in an auto rear-ended them, throwing Khan off balance. Local CCTV footage obtained by police revealed how four-six persons got down from the auto and started attacking Asad with sickles and axes, before he could even react. A bystander also made a video of the victim, who sources said was a small-time AIMIM party worker, being killed and it has since gone viral. Nazar also sustained injuries and was treated at a local hospital and discharged. The footage further shows the killers throwing a knife on the road and speeding away in the auto even as shocked people watched from a distance. “Asad is an accused in the murder of one Amjad Khan in Shastripuram area in 2018 and today he was travelling from Teegalkunta, where his first wife resides, to Shama colony in Mailardevpally, where his second wife stays,” a senior police official probing the case said. Police are checking whether Asad’s murder was a revenge by people linked to the late Amjad. Preliminary investigations revealed that one of Amjad’s sons had got married to Asad’s daughter in the past, but the marriage did not last for long and the couple got separated. “Enraged at the separation, Asad had allegedly killed Amjad in 2018,” a police officer said. Following Amjad’s murder in 2018, the police invoked a PD Act against Asad Khan, but he challenged the order in the high court and got the police order dismissed. He was counselled by police too. Investigators said the needle of suspicion for Thursday’s killing is on Amjad Khan’s kin and they are on the lookout for the suspects. “We are confident that we will crack the case soon,” said deputy commissioner of police (Shamshabad zone) M Prakash Reddy. In the last three years, at least four to five murders have taken place in Hyderabad and suburbs, where victims were hacked to death in broad daylight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/revenge-realtor-killed-on-city-road/articleshow/81864715.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Woman candidates lead charge in high-voltage Bankura polls||BANKURA/ BISHNUPUR/ BARJORA: Amidst sweltering heat around 1.30pm on Thursday, actress Sayantika Banerjee looked visibly angry on learning that her polling agent at Gorabari Primary School on the outskirts of Bankura Town was “missing.” The local leadership tried to explain that the agent had gone for his lunch after 80% polling got over. “You promised me the moon during the campaign. Is this what you are delivering?” the Trinamool candidate from Bankura fumed. Trinamool’s Bishnupur candidate Archita Bid returned home on Wednesday post midnight. “The last moment strategies had to be worked out. But on Thursday, I was one of the first to cast the vote in my booth. Since then, it has been a whirlwind tour across the rural belts,” she said. BJP’s Barjora candidate Supriti Chatterjee sounded emphatic. “We are winning. The women’s power is triumphing here,” she said. Chatterjee spent the day visiting the polling stations where EVM malfunctioned. Bankura, a district known for its red soil, terracotta temples and Baluchari sarees, holds a special place in Bengal elections this year where women voters outnumber the men in several seats. Bankura’s eight urban and semi-urban constituencies that went to polls on Thursday saw as many as seven women contesting. Even smaller parties have fielded multiple women candidates from Bankura. On Thursday, each one of them were in action — criss-crossing the roads of Bankura, Kotulpur, Bishnupur and Barjora. Trinamool alone has fielded three candidates in this round, having already fielded two others in the first round. While actress Sayantika Banerjee is the star candidate from Bankura (town), Archana Bid — all of 32 — is the youngest in the fray. Runu Mete is the wife of two-time MLA Gurupada Mete. Sangeeta Malik has taken up the tough challenge of contesting from Kotulpur after sitting MLA Shyamal Santtra shifted to the more “safer” Sonamukhi seat. Other parties like Congress, too, have taken note of the importance of women voters and have fielded its councillor Radharani Banerjee. BJP has fielded Supriti Chatterjee from Barjora. But it will not be a cakewalk for these candidates even amongst the women voters who ascertained that they are far from being “taken for granted.” “Merely fielding a woman candidate is not enough. During the lockdown, it was Didi who had promised free ration. Her men did not always deliver on the promises. The MP chose to stay back in Delhi. We can judge on our own who to vote for,” claims Archana Saha, a resident of Lalbazar. “In my village everyone has got their Swasthya Sathi cards made, Didi has done a good thing,” says Uma Dutta, who supplements her family by doing tailoring jobs. “No one has worked for women as much as Mamata. Girls have got cycles, families get money to marry off their daughters. But my village is divided. Many people are voting for BJP, that’s clear as they keep criticising the jora-phool people. They say she has not given any employment, that her men do tolabaji, ” said Dutta while casting her vote at Madhabganj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/woman-candidates-lead-charge-in-high-voltage-bankura-polls/articleshow/81858115.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Hyderabad||Rise in Covid-19 positive cases in Hyderabad likely till June||HYDERABAD: Notwithstanding the rise in positive cases in the state, the upward curve in Covid-19 cases in Greater Hyderabad is causing concern among officials. While the sero surveillance is predicting that every one person in two is infected in GHMC limits, the current trend is indicating that any let-up now could bring the situation back to what it was like in June and July last year. Despite sero surveillance hinting at herd immunity, the city is witnessing an increase in the number of cases in the last 10 days. Officials recalled that the positivity rate was highest in August last year. Officials said though it is not possible to predict what would be the number of cases in GHMC four months from now, a rise in the number of cases is likely to continue till June. Experts said that people in Hyderabad need to be more careful as the city has dense population and that there is every possibility of cases seeing a sharp spike. “A possible second wave as seen in some states is very much on the cards here too. In Telangana and Greater Hyderabad, the positive cases will certainly go up though not alarmingly. But, if social distancing is not maintained, it can lead to a second wave-like situation,” Dr Subodh Kandhamuthan, professor and director of Centre for Health Care Management, Administrative Staff College of India, said. Experts explained that this time more number of children and very young people are getting infected as seen in neighbouring Karnataka. “There was anticipation of this in that state and closing down schools was a good decision considering a cluster of cases being reported,” Dr Subodh said. Officials also observe that Hyderabad being the centre of business activity there is a large influx of people from other states. “This is the reason why we are advising people to be more cautious,” a health official said. It may be recalled the highest number of positive cases between June-August last year was reported in Greater Hyderabad. “We are prepared to face the situation. The onus is on people to maintain social distancing and adhere to Covid-19 protocols,” Dr K Ramesh Reddy, director of medical education, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rise-in-cases-in-hyd-likely-till-june/articleshow/81861396.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Nagpur||NMC banks heavily on govt aid, earns merely 20% of its revenue||NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) earns a mere 20% of its Rs1,924 crore revenue, with the rest coming from state and central government grants. NMC accounts and finance department data says the civic body garnered Rs487.3 crore from its different sources of income, including Rs241 crore from property tax and Rs156 crore from water works, till March 31. Town planning department contributed Rs40 crore, while NMC earned Rs42 crore from levying various charges on property owners in Gunthewari layouts, whereas the market department contributed Rs8.3 crore. However, the grant it received from the state and central governments for various development works is much higher than NMC’s own revenue. It received Rs1437.89 crore. Together, NMC has received Rs1,924 crore revenue including both, government grants and its own sources. Sources pointed out that NMC will yet again miss the revised budget target for the last financial year. NMC’s financial woes increased further after the state government once again reduced the GST grant. In March, the civic body received half of the GST grant – it used to receive Rs100.50 crore which was slashed to Rs50.25 crore. This means, NMC will miss all three targets of the last fiscal – draft budget of then municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe, who had projected Rs2,547 crore income, which was later revised to Rs 2,731 crore by then standing committee chairman Vijay Zalke. A fortnight ago, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B had brought down Zalke’s target to Rs2,433 crore. The one-time settlement and amnesty schemes to improve recovery from property and water tax defaulters too evoked a poor response thanks to the callous attitude of the civic staff, sources said. Standing committee chairman Prakash Bhoyar will present the budget for the current fiscal some time this month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-banks-heavily-on-govt-aid-earns-merely-20-of-its-revenue/articleshow/81861381.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Guru Katti, president, Swarajya Vahan Chalak Sanghatna, said, “The Pune district has around 1.25 lakh cab drivers. Of them, around 80% have been able to resume work after the first lockdown. If another lockdown is imposed, more than 40% cabbies will never be able to get back to business again,” he said. He added that they would send a letter to the authorities, requesting them not to announce another lockdown. Nitin Pawar, convener, Rickshaw Panchayat, the largest autorickshaw union in the city, said, “If the authorities are mulling another lockdown, the state government should take responsibility of all those who will be affected.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cab-auto-drivers-fret-over-survival/articleshow/81858085.cms||Joy Sengupta

They said many customers, who had joined the gyms, do not want to continue with their subscription while new customers are unwilling to sign up for the time being. Nilesh Kale, president of Pune fitness club association, said, “The situation of many gym owners is already bad as they have started losing business over the last few weeks. Another lockdown will completely destroy them. Several people, including fitness trainers, have lost their jobs as about 500 gyms in the city did not open after the last lockdown. If another lockdown takes place, many of us won’t be able to reopen gyms again.” The city has about 3,000 gyms. Last year, gyms and fitness clubs were closed for eight months, eventually reopening in November.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/gym-owners-dread-further-losses/articleshow/81858061.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Lucknow||UP: Hooch claims three lives in Ayodhya and Farrukhabad||AYODHYA/KANPUR/PRAYAGRAJ: Spurious liquor claimed two lives at Gosainganj area of Ayodhya and one in Farrukhabad late Wednesday even as the Pratapgarh hooch tragedy toll rose to six, with two others dying on Thursday. At least six others are battling for life at the district hospital in Ayodhya after attending a booze party hosted by a former pradhan, who is again in the fray for panchayat elections, said Ayodhya SSP Shailesh Pandey. The former pradhan, Rajnath Verma, had thrown a Holi party for residents of Trilokpuri village in the garb of seeking votes, said police. As the party progressed through the night, several villagers began vomiting, lost consciousness and even suffered partial blindness after consuming hooch. Verma is on the run and police have constituted a team to nab him. While Virendra Verma, 32, and Dharmendra Verma, 30, died in hospital early Thursday, six others — Jayaram, Kalpu, Musai, Ghurahu Prasad, Rajesh Prajapati and Ram Shubhavan Verma — are in a critical condition. Motilal Verma, father of the deceased, Dharmendra Verma, has demanded action against the former village pradhan, Rajnath, and has lodged a police complaint. In Farrukhabad, a 70-year-old man, Maharaj Singh, died and his brother, Jhabbu Singh, 50, is battling for life after consuming hooch at a Holi party in Majra Nagla Khara village of late Wednesday. Many villagers who attended the party complained of uneasiness, vomiting, and blurred vision, said police. “It’s not clear if Singh died after having hooch or due to excessive drinking. The autopsy report is awaited,” said, circle officer Kaimganj, Rajveer Singh Gaur. At Katariya village in Pratapgarh, 100km from Ayodhya, the toll in the hooch tragedy toll rose to six with two more dying on Thursday.

---||Lucknow||Vaccines take time to develop immunity; differ for all: Experts||Lucknow: LU teachers were surprised as to how Prof Sharma turned critical even after taking a shot of the vaccine, but experts said that there is no need to panic but take precautions even after vaccination because vaccines take time to develop immunity and it varies person to person. A person can get infected even after two doses of vaccine, but possibilities of the infection causing severe illness are less. However, in this case, they said, it seems that the patient got infected within a week after getting the first jab, when antibodies had not started building up, a senior health officer said. Further, another expert said, the first RT-PCR test done on March 23, two days after developing symptoms, came negative apparently because the viral load would have been less at that time. Since, she added, he was a senior citizen and had hypertension and diabetes, the infection aggravated at a faster pace after entering the body, resulting in critical illness that caused the death. “Most Covid vaccines have efficacy between 70-90%. In rare cases, the immune system may not respond to the vaccination at all,” said Prof Amita Jain, head microbiology, KGMU. Hence, vaccines offer protection to most of the people, but still it is very important to take precautions all the time and do not be complacent with a “false sense of security” after getting vaccinated. Prof Anil Kumar Gulati, ex-head microbiology, IMS, BHU, said that antibodies start developing two weeks after first dose and keep on consolidating in following weeks. These antibodies offer some protection, but adequate immunity develops only two weeks after the second/booster dose, hence no letting the guard down even after vaccination.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vaccines-take-time-to-develop-immunity-differ-for-all-experts/articleshow/81863864.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||City researchers part of global team to demystify Covid-19 virus origin||Hyderabad: While there is consensus that Covid-19 virus evolved from the coronavirus present in bats, it still remains a mystery how the new virus has taken pandemic proportions. A team of international researchers, including those from the Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT) in Hyderabad and Kakatiya Medical College and MG Hospital in Warangal, have taken up research to demystify the proximal origin of the pandemic virus. Researchers point out that the unique features of Covid-19 virus raise several questions about how it had evolved from the bats. They argue that Covid-19 is the seventh human coronavirus, but it is the first one that has caused the pandemic. While other human coronaviruses like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) disappeared without a pandemic, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) is mostly endemic to the Arabian Peninsula, they said in their study published in the recent issue of Journal of Medical Virology. Calling for further research to decode the mystery, the study said the type of mutations observed in the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19 are generally not seen in other human coronaviruses. “There is a consensus that the novel coronavirus originated naturally from bat coronaviruses. However, the novel coronavirus host tropism/adaptation pattern has significant discrepancies compared with other coronaviruses, raising questions concerning its proximal origin,” the research study said. The research team is from different institutions in USA, UK, Switzerland, New Zealand, Iran, Jordan and Sudan, besides Hyderabad and Warangal in Telangana. According to the study, although millions of cases have been recorded globally, Covid-19 virus S protein does not have any apparent further recombination, placing it in conflict with the recombination models of other coronaviruses. Bat or rodent coronaviruses demonstrate certain specific changes in the S protein-binding domain during the host adaptation. However, in the case of the Covid-19 virus, it does not have the signature changes that were found in other human coronaviruses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-researchers-part-of-global-team-to-demystify-covid-19-virus-origin/articleshow/81861415.cms||Syed Akbar

Those who generate more than 100kg of waste a day are considered to be bulk waste generators. There are around 1,000 bulk waste generators in the city including marriage halls, hoteliers, schools and colleges, theatres and residents’ welfare associations.The civic body had conducted sensitisation meetings with stake holders in 2019. It yielded good results as many bulk waste generators established their own waste handling mechanisms to convert the waste into manure and cooking gas plants.Madurai corporation allocates a major share of resource and manpower to deal with the garbage generated in the city. Around Rs 15/kg is being spent to collect and dispose waste, if the wages and benefits of employees involved in the work are calculated. Anywhere between 630 to 650 tonne of garbage is collected in the city in a day. The civic body has built 26 micro composting centres (MCC) each with five tonne capacity, in various parts of the city in the last one-and-a-half years. Although the quantity of waste going to Vellaikkal dumping yard came down after MCCs came into operation, it has gone up again owing to bulk waste generators.An official from corporation admitted that they could not concentrate on bulk waste generators as they had to focus on covid-19 prevention activities. Bulk waste generators contribute to around 15-20% of the total waste generated in the city, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/bulk-waste-generators-not-processing-on-their-own/articleshow/81863862.cms||V Devanathan

The video was shared widely in Whatsapp groups and Facebook.T B Somanathan, an animal activist, who took the issue to the notice of officials in Ramanathapuram, said that culling of stray dogs is rampant at various local bodies in the state. It becomes an issue only when videos come out. “Culling of animals is prohibited under the law. But cases are rarely registered,” he said.An official from Ramanathapuram district administration said that a stray dog bit seven people including children in Paramakudi last week, which created unrest among villagers. The complaint reached the district collector, who forwarded it to the Paramakudi municipality. “The employees’ intention was only to shift the dog away from the villages to the garbage yard. However, action has been taken against the employees for showing cruelty to the animals. The garbage yard in-charge has been suspended from and two contract employees have been terminated,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/anger-over-video-showing-cruelty-to-dogs-1-suspended/articleshow/81863863.cms||---

SKM members Surjit Singh Phool, Ruldu Singh Mansa, and Jagjit Singh Dallewal had claimed to have “forgiven” Lakha Sidhana already but the morcha had not made it official, so far. But on Thursday evening, it issued a press release in the name of senior member Darshan Pal that: “The 32 farmer unions of Punjab and the SKM have decided to move on because the agitation needs young blood such as Lakha Sidhana. We thank all the associations, leaders, Sikh thinkers, players, and artists who supported us.” Darshan Pal confirmed that the SKM had resolved all issues with Lakha Sidhana and he was now “a part of the morcha”. Delhi Police are in a manhunt for Lakha Sidhana. There’s a reward of Rs 1 lakh for inputs about his whereabouts. Rajinder Singh Deep Singh Wala of the SKM had branded both Lakha Sidhana and co-accused actor Deep Sidhu “traitors” and accused them of diverting the January 26 tractor parade to the Red Fort and egging the protesters to pitch a Sikh flag on its ramparts. It widened the rift between them. During all this, Lakha Sidhana made a public appearance at Mehraj village in Bathinda district on February 23 despite being on the radar of Delhi Police. Surjit Singh Phool of the SKM had defended him at Gurdwara Mastuana Sahib in Sangrur district on March 14, paving the way for his return. Morcha’s Ruldu Singh Mansa had claimed in Chandigarh on March 25 that the SKM had agreed to readmit Lakha Sidhana and let him use its stage. Dallewal addressed rally in support at Chatha Nanhera village in Sangrur district on March 30. Ruldu Singh Mansa said: “Lakha Sidhana is one of us. All his associates are part of the farmers’ struggle.” On the morcha’s call for social boycott of the BJP members and allies, Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala was heckled by the farmers in Hisar. They didn’t let his helicopter take off. The farmers cordoned Pilibanga’s BJP MLA Dharmendra Singh at the Dabli toll plaza in Hanumangarh, Rajasthan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/skm-accepts-lakha-sidhana-back-needs-young-blood/articleshow/81861417.cms||Neel Kamal

Bhuniya had lost Sabang only once, in 2001. He was nominated by Trinamool to halt BJP’s substantial inroads in Sabang. Long-time party worker and Suvendu Adhikari-loyalist Amulya Maiti, who defected to BJP, is now pitted against Bhuniya, making the battle tougher. “The way he (Maiti) has been given a party ticket at the expense of other old timers will have its impact here,” Bhuniya said. On Thursday, Bhuniya started his day early. After offering puja in a Sitala temple, he, along with his wife Gita, cast their votes at a local school. Gita is the sitting Sabang MLA, a seat she contested in 2017, when her husband was nominated for Rajya Sabha. BJP had got 40% votes in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. In 2016 assembly elections, BJP had 2.6% votes, but it rose to 18% in the 2017 assembly bypolls. This time, Bhuniya had a tough time arranging for the release six of his party workers on bail to bring them to cast their votes. “They were returning last night when they were detained by central forces,” Bhuniya said. This incident and others kept Bhunia busy with party workers in the party office till late night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/battle-hardened-bhuniya-confident-of-retaining-sabang/articleshow/81858195.cms||Sujoy Khanra

Despite surveys showing production and employment in manufacturing sector nearly back to pre-pandemic levels, organisations like the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture (MCCIA) pointed out that MSMEs have recovered slower than larger units. This disparity, according to industry observers, is due to various inherent advantages in large units, such as financial ability to sustain losses, stable labour force etc. “If another lockdown is declared, we will be badly affected. The labour force will go back to their villages once again. It will be a big disruption to 1,000 or so small units in Chakan-Khed belt,” said Dilip Batval, secretary, Federation of Chakan Industries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/msmes-bear-brunt-of-closure/articleshow/81858156.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal assembly polls: Parties trade charges as cop-vs-cop drama plays out in Debra all day||DEBRA: The face-off between two former IPS officers at Debra saw several rounds of allegations and counter allegations being levelled against each other all through Thursday. Though the candidates admitted that polling was peaceful, there were complaints from both camps that polling agents were not allowed into the booths. BJP candidate Bharati Ghosh had resigned in December 2017 shortly after she was transferred from the post of SP West Midnapore. Humayun Kabir, who was leading the Chandernagore commissionerate, quit this January and joined Trinamool. The two parties had pitted them against each other when they announced the candidates for Debra. Ghosh started off early on Thursday, visiting multiple booths in the constituency. In booth 209 at Islampur Primary School, she alleged her agent had not been allowed in. “Till the EC acts on the complaints, I will not budge from here,” she claimed. Learning about her presence in the polling booth, Trinamool workers gathered near the booth and counter-alleged that Ghosh was bringing in outsiders to foment trouble. An elderly person — one Mohan Singh, who claimed to be BJP mandal sabhapati — who was in Ghosh’s car was identified by the locals who began protesting around the vehicle till police arrived and took him into custody. Later, the police vehicle carrying Singh was stopped near Hariharpur’s Raikha crossing by Ghosh and BJP supporters. They demanded that Singh be released and even sat down on the road, blocking the path. After Ghosh left for the returning officer’s control room at Balichak Bhajahari Institute, the OC of Debra PS arrived and took Singh to the police station. Kabir, too, had started visiting booths in the morning. He did not allow anyone except his election agent to accompany him. He later complained that he had not been allowed to enter eight polling booths. At one of them in Radhakantapur, a BSF jawan asked for his identity. Kabir alleged that when he said he was a candidate, the security personnel had asked which party he belonged to.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/parties-trade-charges-as-cop-vs-cop-drama-plays-out-in-debra-all-day/articleshow/81858150.cms||Sujoy Khanra
---||Hyderabad||Amid Covid surge, health centre shut over bill dues||Hyderabad: At a time when the state is scrambling to control the spread of Covid-19, the Bible House Urban Primary Health Care Center (UPHC) in Kavadiguda — which is also a Covid-19 testing facility — was asked to down its shutters. This, after authorities from the state health department allegedly failed to pay the property rent and other utility bills for almost a year. The Bible House UPHC provides health care services to nearly nine slums across Musheerabad and Bholakpur areas, which are among the most vulnerable places. “As of now, we have eight positive cases in our area. The slums that we cater to are heavily populated and there are chances of the infection spreading rapidly. Apart from providing support and treatment to Covid-19 positive cases, we conduct 60 to 70 Covid-19 antigen tests and about eight to 10 RT-PCR tests every single day,” said a medical officer at the UPHC. Health workers also said officials of electricity department who came to disconnect the power supply gave an exemption after doctors informed that Covid-19 vaccines will go waste and might lose their efficacy if not stored in the right temperature. TOI on Thursday procured a letter for the electricity bill for February 2021. The letter addressed to the district medical and health care officer says, “The total bill amount of Rs 15,030 has been due since October 2020. The payment due date is February 22, 2021.” Apart from Covid-19 treatment, closure of UPHC is hampering medical services to pregnant women and health care services to poor. Health officials denied allegations of not paying rent or other utility bills. “There is absolutely no question of not paying the rent or bills. Since this has now been brought to my notice, I will definitely look into it,” said Vakati Karuna, commissioner of health and family welfare department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/amid-covid-surge-health-centre-shut-over-bill-dues/articleshow/81861427.cms||Moulika.KV

This also resulted in the highest employment generation in the past three years as well. Till March 30, 2021, the state had achieved 124% of its target for issue and use of margin money for setting up businesses under the Prime Minister Rozgar Srijan programme, as against the national average of about 89%. Out of this, the UP Khadi and Gramudyog Board ensured usage of 173% of its target, the district industries centre achieved 134% of its target and the Khadi and Gramudyog Commission 61% of its target. “UP has been performing exceedingly well on the employment generation front. Under the guidance of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, the MSME and Khadi departments have not just met their targets for self-employment generation but also surpassed them. With the onset of the Covid pandemic in 2020, the departments worked hard to ensure that people who had lost their jobs were provided with help in the form of loans to become financially independent and therefore, the most employment generation actually took place last year,” said additional chief secretary, MSME and Khadi, Navneet Sehgal. As per data available with the khadi department, 5,670 beneficiaries were issued loans of Rs 689 crore under the PM Rozgar Srijan Scheme in 2020-21, generating 45,360 jobs. A year earlier, 16,115 jobs were generated under this programme with loans issued to 2,424 people, while in 2018-19, 521 people benefitted under the scheme with 3,453 jobs generated. Under the CM Yuva Swarozgar Scheme, 4,789 beneficiaries were given loans of Rs 412 crore in 2020-21 which generated 38,312 jobs. This is up from 22,952 jobs generated in 2019-20. The ODOP scheme launched in 2018 saw loans of Rs 373 crore being issued to 3,027 beneficiaries in 2020-21. This helped provide employment to 24,216 people.  The year the scheme started, 916 beneficiaries received loans of Rs 125 crore which resulted in employment generation of 7,328.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-meets-highest-loan-disbursal-target/articleshow/81863904.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Dage, who works as an executive at a hotel in the hill resort, had to change his commute pattern after the lockdown was imposed last year, as suburban trains between Pune and Lonavla were suspended. Now, the travel restrictions between 8pm and 7am have come as another blow. “I recently began to travel to Lonavla on the special Deccan Queen with reserved tickets. But when I reached Pune station around 9pm on Thursday, it was difficult getting transportation because of the restrictions,” Dage told TOI. Sharad Joshi, who works in Lonavla, said, “I used to take a local train to Lonavla. Many like me now rely on the special inter-city trains like Deccan Queen and Indrayani Express. Getting a reserved ticket for these trains is not easy.” The Pune railway division has suffered revenue losses ever since 42 trains between Pune and Lonavla were suspended. The division earned Rs19.41 crore from local train passengers in 2019-20.

The procurement exercise will be carried out through 156 market committees operational in the state. A total of 5,600 field staff will ensure smooth functioning of procurement operations in the Rabi Marketing Season (RMS). These details were finalised at a meeting chaired by Punjab State Agricultural Marketing Board (Mandi Board) chairman Lal Singh. During the last season, 128 LMT wheat was successfully procured despite the Covid pandemic. A total of 17.39 lakh passes were issued to farmers through arhtiyas (commission agents). Singh said efforts would be made to ensure that farmers’ work was done within 12 hours of the arrival of their yield in grain markets and within 48 hours in case there were exceptional reasons. In view of the Covid pandemic, physical distancing will be maintained with box markings of 30x30 feet in all grain yards and procurement centres, where farmers will unload their yield separately. Adequate arrangements have been made for clean drinking water, toilets and spray of sodium hypochlorite. Lal Singh said coupons with one-day validity would be issued to farmers through arhtiyas for each trolley. “We are going to adopt a special mechanism this time, under which farmers would be in touch with arhtiyas to bring their yield on specific dates and on specific yards. Space markings are being done for smooth functioning,” said Singh. Farmers and arhtiyas have been asked to download the ‘epmb mobile app’ of the Mandi Board to keep themselves updated about procurement activities and issuance of coupons. Covid safety measures would be in place during procurement operations to ensure the safety of farmers, employees of various procurement agencies, Mandi board and market committees, labourers as well as arhtiyas. Meanwhile, farmers have been suggested that they store wheat at homes/farm stores for short durations to avoid rush in grain markets in view of the Covid situation. Besides the facilities being provided by the Mandi Board, arhtiyas will also provide sanitisers and masks to farmers. A control room has been set up to facilitate both farmers and arhtiyas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-gears-up-to-procure-130-lmt-wheat-at-3972-grain-markets/articleshow/81861422.cms||---

Health officials expect the numbers to pick up in the next few days.In Madurai district, 2,236 beneficiaries, including healthcare workers, frontline workers, general public and those getting the second dose were vaccinated for Covid-19 on Thursday. Among them, 1,201 were those from the general public getting their first dose, with 637 aged between 45-59 years while the rest were aged above 60 years. However, the numbers are on the lower side as the district has previously vaccinated up to 5,000 beneficiaries in a single day.“It is just the first day so vaccination was relatively slow. The public can vaccinate either by pre-registration or by just walking into a session site with verified ID proof. There is no shortage in vaccine but redistribution of vaccine is being done. We are expecting to receive fresh supply from the state in two days,” said Dr KV Arjun Kumar, deputy director of health services, Madurai. The official added that there was no crowding so far as vaccination is currently being done at 207 sites in the district, including 153 government facilities and 54 private hospitals.K Manickavel, 54, owner of a grocery store, who took the Covid-19 vaccine on Thursday, said that he wanted to take the vaccine as he is in contact with a large number of people every day and with cases rising. “Shop owners like us get exposed just as much as frontline workers so I’m glad to be eligible to take the Covid-19 vaccine. I don’t have any co-morbid conditions but still I was scared because of my age and by taking the vaccine, my fears have also eased a little.

---||Chandigarh||Sukhbir corners Amarinder on poll promises, announces sops||Ajnala (Amritsar ): Reminding chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh of unfulfilled poll promises “made with an oath on the Gutka Sahib,” SAD president Sukhbir Badal accused Amarinder of “betraying” people of Punjab. At the same time, he claimed that SAD had always stood by the promises made to people. Deploring Congress leaders, Sukhbir alleged that Amarinder had done nothing to keep his promises and had instead, defaulted on the oath “which he took in the name of holy Gutka Sahib and Dashmesh Pitah” to waive off farmers’ loans. “Amarinder has backstabbed the youth, to whom he promised jobs in each household, besides unemployment allowance of Rs 2,500 per month. He has also betrayed lakhs of scheduled caste students, who were not given SC scholarship fee, which forced them out of educational institutions,” claimed Sukhbir at the third Punjab Mangda Jawab rally. Saying that SAD always stood by the promises made to people, Sukhbir claimed, “former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal promised to give free power to farmers for agricultural operations and fulfilled this promise in the very first cabinet meeting after assuming power in the state. We have always worked for the welfare of farmers and were responsible for the start of assured food grain procurement on minimum support price (MSP) in 1966. A majority of agricultural markets for procurement of foodgrains were establishment during the tenure of SAD-led governments.” Sukhbir announced that once SAD forms government in the state, it would not allow implementation of the three agricultural laws. He also announced that besides ensuring procurement of foodgrains on MSP, his government would also announce MSP for vegetables, fruits and milk. “Power tariff for domestic consumption will be halved while scheduled caste and backward class students will be given free education facility,” Sukhbir claimed. Besides fulfilling the demand for a bridge in Ajnala constituency if voted to power, his government would also establish a technical institute for girls in the constituency, he said. Other Akali leaders who spoke on the occasion included Bikram Singh Majithia and Lakhbir Singh Lodhinangal.  BOX 1 ‘Amarinder scared of BJP’ Sukhbir Badal alleged that Amarinder Singh is afraid of standing up to the BJP-led Central government, which is why he had not taken any concrete step to stop the implementation of the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme for government purchase of the wheat crop. “Amarinder is playing a fixed match with the Centre government, which is clear from the fact that he has asked for time to implement the DBT scheme instead of declining to implement it. It is clear that the chief minister has become part of the Central conspiracy to punish farmers of Punjab for opposing the three agricultural laws”, he alleged. BOX 2 ‘Plot to bar party from contesting’ Sukhbir accused the Central government of allegedly teaming up with the AAP government in Delhi as well as SAD (D) president Paramjit Singh Sarna and Jago president Manjit Singh GK to stop SAD from contesting the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) elections. Claiming that the alleged conspiracy had been thwarted, he condemned the attempt to use underhand means to “stifle the voice of the Panth.” “If the various groups which had got together to get the SAD debarred thought they were popular with the Sangat, then they should not be afraid of contesting polls,” he said. BOX 3: Sukhbir takes on AAP Sukhbir also took on AAP national and state convener Arvind Kejriwal and Bhagwant Mann respectively for allegedly playing a double game on the three agricultural laws. He accused Kejriwal of doing a “big drama” of opposing the agri laws during the party’s recent meeting in Baghapurana, even though his government was the first to implement the laws in Delhi. He said Bhagwant Mann had given his assent to the amended Essential Commodities Act at a meeting of the Standing Committee on Food and Consumer Affairs. Badal also dared Amarinder to name any hospital, college or road he had constructed during the last four years. He claimed that the SAD established 13 universities, 30 colleges and 300 skill centres during its tenure.  Box 4 No masks no social distancing Covid 19 safety norms were thrown to the winds during the rally in Ajnala. Akali leaders and activists were seen without masks.

Reviewing the power situation with various distribution companies though a video conferencing, Sharma asked all managing directors of such companies to fix the accountability of officials responsible for power cuts. Sharma said the energy department had rolled out a power roster according to which rural areas are supposed to get uninterrupted power supply from sunset to sunrise. The energy minister reiterated that power officials should reach to every possible electricity consumer who is erring in payment of bills. The minister asked the MDs of distribution companies to inspect the sub-stations and ensure that consumers do not face any problem in depositing their bills. On Wednesday, the energy department had extended the one time settlement (OTS) scheme — entailing waiver of surcharge in power bills — till April 15.

According to the property consultancy’s ‘Global Residential Cities Index Q4 2020’, the city stood 122nd on the world-wide list, registering a 0.2% year-on-year rise in cost of houses, even as Chennai – lowest ranked Indian city at 150th spot – witnessed a steep 9% drop in home prices. While Hyderabad’s position in the last quarter was lower than its earlier ratings – 20th in Q1 (January to April) and 36th in Q2 (May to August) -- it still fared better than most other metros. “In Q4 2020, residential sales in Hyderabad jumped up by 127% Q-o-Q to 3,651 units as compared to 1,609 units in Q3 2020. This can be attributed mainly to festive season promotions and the Covid-induced push for newer homes with a better layout, thereby accommodating the new work requirements from home,” read the report that pegged the average growth in home prices – among 150 global cities – from 3.2% in 2019 to 5.6% in 2020. Shishir Baijal, chairman and MD of Knight Frank India said, “Its residential market has remained consistent all through pandemic, with city’s real estate market maintaining annual price growth in each quarter, through 2020. This performance can be attributed to city being a preferred destination by professionals from IT/ITeS firms.” He added: “Indian residential market has strongly rebounded over last three quarters with pandemic experience on owning houses, lower prices and multi-decade low home loan interest rate. Government interventions on stamp duty cut in key markets helped sector gain momentum to pre-Covid levels.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-only-indian-city-to-witness-growth-in-home-prices-report/articleshow/81861429.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||CM fooling arthiyas, assured Centre to implement DBT: SAD||Chandigarh: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Thursday said Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh was fooling arhtiyas with fake assurances in the same manner in which he had “deceived every section of society.” The party asked him to make the letter he had allegedly written to the Prime Minister on the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme public. SAD leader and former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra said it was ridiculous that the chief minister was making assurances that the current DBT system, under which payment for government purchase of food grains is made to arthiyas, would continue when his government had also given a written assurance to the Centre that the new system of direct transfer into farmers’ accounts would be started from the current season. He added that it had been one and a half years since the Congress government had assured the Centre that it would implement the proposed system and “end a successful system which had withstood the test of time.” “The chief minister failed to meet the Union food supplies minister or even the Prime Minister to ensure that the new system was not introduced in Punjab. Even now, he has been talking about writing to the Prime Minister in his meeting with the arthiyas but has done nothing concrete to ensure that the new system is not imposed on Punjab,” said Chandumajra. He urged people of Punjab to be ready to fight against the allegedly “discriminatory attitude of the Centre towards Punjab.” He claimed that the Centre wanted to punish Punjabis for leading the protests against the three agricultural laws. The SAD leader also said that the Congress government had not even taken up the case of the Rs 800 crore the Centre owed on account of rural development fund.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cm-fooling-arthiyas-assured-centre-to-implement-dbt-sad/articleshow/81861462.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Yogi Adityanath storms Kerala, accuses Pinarayi Vijayan of trampling upon ‘sanatan aastha’||LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday launched a vitriolic attack on Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, accusing him of being involved in gold smuggling. “Kerala mein kuch naya dekhne ko mil raha hai. CM P Vijayan ke karyalay gold ki taskari mein lipta hai. Yeh sharmnak ghatna hai, Bharat ke itihaas ki. (Involvement of CM P Vijayan’s office in a gold smuggling case will go down as one of the most disgraceful episodes in India’s history),” Yogi said, while addressing twin rallies in Haripad and Kattakkada in poll-bound Kerala. Yogi’s attack comes days after the customs department submitted in Kerala high court that key accused in gold smuggling case, Swapna Suresh, has revealed links with CM Vijayan. Invoking the bond between UP and Kerala, Yogi hailed the role of the then district magistrate of Faizabad, K K Nair, a Kerala native, who played a stellar role in protecting the idol of Ram Lalla at the then disputed site in Ayodhya. “People of Kerala dedicate their contribution to the Ram temple in the name of KK Nair,” he said at a rally in Kattakkada. He also said, after Tripura, the last standing Left citadel in Kerala will also fall. The UP chief minister categorically targeted the Opposition, essentially the Congress, Muslim League and the Left, accusing them of hatching conspiracies since independence to not only dent ‘sanatan astha’ of people in Kerala, but also to interrupt development of the south Indian state. He said, development hasn’t picked pace in Kerala over the years. “The biggest example is complete failure of the state government to contain the pandemic. It proves the entire government machinery lies crippled,” he charged. Yogi said, both ruling CPM-led LDF and Congress-led UDF have indulged in ‘bhai-bhatijawaad’ (nepotism), corruption and anarchy. The UP CM said, even the Kerala public service commission, which should have provided jobs to youth, has turned into a den of corruption. “Some unemployed youth have committed suicide, while others are in depression,” he said. Lambasting UDF and LDF for ignoring welfare of ‘sanatan sanskriti (ancient culture, tradition), Yogi accused the two political fronts of having a covert agreement to transfer power among themselves after every five years. While pitching BJP-led NDA as a key alternative in the poll-bound state, Yogi accused Congress, Muslim League along with People Front of India (PFI) of being engaged in anti-national conspiracy. Yogi cited the Kerala high court order of 2009, cautioning the then state government against forced religious conversion. “But the state government did nothing under pressure of PFI and other ‘jihadi forces. There is a conspiracy to turn Kerala into an Islamic state,” he said. Later leading an emphatic road show in Adoor, Kazhakkoottam and Parassala assembly seats of Kerala, Yogi said, BJP does what it promises, respects ‘astha’, besides ensuring good governance, development and safety.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-storms-kerala-accuses-vijayan-of-trampling-upon-sanatan-aastha/articleshow/81863926.cms||Pankaj Shah

According to police, the deceased — 20-year-old Sudha Raut, a BA student — came in touch with the suspect through a social networking site around a year ago and they were talking over the phone for the past 10 months. The suicide note stated that the suspect had promised to marry Raut but due to some reasons he decided to back out. This upset the girl who then decided to take the extreme step. The woman hung herself at her residence in Shivshankar Colony on February 13 and her family got hold of the letter the next day. However, they were not aware about the youth named in the letter. Jawaharnagar police was informed about the suicide note following which police got into action and came to know about the suspect after scanning through the woman’s social media account.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/youth-booked-for-abetment-of-suicide/articleshow/81852489.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Rajkot||High input cost takes toll on Rajkot imitation jewellery biz||Rajkot: The skyrocketing prices of raw material coupled with the surge in Covid-19 cases have put brakes on the recovery of Rajkot’s imitation jewellery that has been reeling under financial crisis since the beginning of the pandemic. The already stressed industry that employs over 3 lakh workers and has an annual turnover of Rs 3,000 crore, has been hit hard due to spike in the cost of raw materials that have gone up by 60-70% in the last three months. Many of the manufacturing unit owners had to cancel orders from wholesalers as they could hardly afford to deliver goods at old rates. According to industry rules, the manufactures or workers provide the finished product to the trader or wholesaler based on the order. The raw material including colours, metals like zinc and copper are purchased by the manufacturer and then finished jewellery is supplied to the trader. A big manufacturer hires workers at his unit or outsources the jewellery making to those working from residential premises. Jignesh Shah, president of Imitation Jewellery Association said, “In January, all the traders decided to increase rates of finished goods by 20%. But by February end, the raw material price shot up like anything. The manufacturers also demanded another 30% rise in rates, which was not possible for us because of the committed prices to the buyers.” Shah claimed that a number of manufacturers have stopped supply of finished goods at old price and because of that their business had reduced by 60% According to manufacturers, the raw material like colour for enamelling, plastic box, metals like copper, zinc, iron, brass has increased 60-70% since January. Manoj Bhakhar, a manufacturer said, “The cost of enamelling colour was Rs 400/kg when we started the business after lockdown. It rose to Rs 450/kg in January and in March it is Rs 580/kg. The price of plastic boxes in which the jeweller is kept rose because of the hike in petroleum prices.” “The situation is such that many manufacturing units have stopped work because they can’t bear this loss due to higher input cost and traders are not ready to adjust the price rise,” he added. Jitendra Shah, a trader said, “Customers usually don’t want to pay a high price for imitation jewellery. What the workers are asking is at least a 50% hike in rates. In this situation, our business will collapse in a very short period. It had barely come on track after the lockdown.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/high-input-cost-takes-toll-on-rajkot-imitation-jewellery-biz/articleshow/81855312.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Ahmedabad||IIM-A Covid-19 tally 99 in 21 days; 80 active cases||AHMEDABAD: Was it written on the wall? Perhaps not, but certainly in an academic paper. The IIM Ahmedabad (IIM-A) campus which had 126 positive cases on campus (including contract workers and those not living on campus) in about a year, recorded 99 cases in just 21 days, averaging about five cases a day. The scenario of the rapid spread of the viral infection was predicted in an academic paper published in July 2020 by professors from IIM Ahmedabad and IIT Delhi. The study ‘Academic Campuses, Super Spreader Events & Pandemics: Simulation Evidence from Reopening Indian Universities with Covid-19’ involving a fictional campus ‘IIM-X,’ was published in the Health Management, Policy and Innovation (HMPI), a practitioner global health journal. It had simulated a scenario where 10 infected persons could infect 78% of those present on a residential campus in the worst-case scenario (where social distancing is not implemented effectively). The paper had taken a leaf from a few US campuses which had experienced ‘Covid explosions’ after opening up to the community including professors and students, and had suggested not to open campuses for the time being. Experts pointed out that the India-England match in Ahmedabad worked as a possible super-spreader event. A group of students were part of that event and soon after that the virus started spreading. Experts don’t blame the students but the overall conditions unique to residential campuses for the high number of cases. While AMC had put a part of the campus in containment, sources privy to the development said it’s a continuous ‘containment zone’ even now, as several delivery services refuse to enter the campus, virtually cutting the institute off. 75% are asymptomaticIn a statement from the institute on Wednesday, officials maintained that 75% of those infected are asymptomatic and 90% of those who have symptoms are recuperating after 3-4 days of medication. The focus is also on expanding testing and vaccinating all stakeholders. The institute had also implemented a work from home programme till April 1 and had announced a fine of Rs 1,000 for any person seen not wearing a mask on the campus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/iim-a-covid-19-tally-99-in-21-days-80-active-cases/articleshow/81862042.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Holy Week ceremonies curtailed by Covid protocol in Mumbai||Mumbai: For the second year in a row, the Catholic Church has pressed the mute button on Holy Week festivities. Elaborate ceremonies and processions have been cancelled owing to the resurgence of the Covid pandemic. Easter Sunday, the most important occasion on the Christian calendar which comes up April 4, will also be celebrated without community fanfare. Archbishop of Bombay, Oswald Cardinal Gracias, will broadcast all his services online. Issuing Holy Week guidelines to priests, he said, “The washing of the feet ceremony at Maundy Thursday is cancelled. On Good Friday, the individual kissing of the cross is prohibited.” After the unveiling, the cross will be held aloft for the entire congregation to venerate. The Cardinal directed that no special Altar of Repose be prepared at Maundy Thursday, that readings be shortened before Easter Vigil mass and that the fire not be prepared either. Cardinal Gracias recommended that people eligible for the Covid vaccination do opt for it. Still, some groups in IC Colony Borivli performed the washing of the feet ceremony and relayed it live to the community. St Thomas Cathedral, the seat of the Anglican faith, is continuing Holy Week services amid Covid protocol. Kamal Jadhav, a member of the pastorate committee, said, “We do not traditionally have processions. Our services for Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Easter Services are being carried out by following proper Covid protocol. Not more than 50 people in attendance, social distancing and extensive sanitising.” The Cathedral is live streaming all services for parishioners. Meanwhile, Joseph Dias of the Catholic Secular Forum (CSF) has called off his large Good Friday rally of Santacruz for the second pandemic year in a row. “The intentions we are praying for include Fr Stan Swamy still being in prison, the nuns attacked at Jhansi and human rights activists who are being targeted. But the Good Friday procession will not take place. We used to attract a crowd of over 15,000 people along the 15 stations of the cross. The 7 km long rally (from Santacruz West to East) spanned six hours from 10am to 4pm,” he said. CSF will broadcast archival footage on the occasion. Over in Agripada, Cyril Dara, secretary of the United Christians of Mumbai, cancelled his Easter Eve procession of 700-800 people that winds its way around Agripada, Byculla, Nagpada and Mumbai Central.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/holy-week-ceremonies-curtailed-by-covid-protocol-in-mumbai/articleshow/81863936.cms||Bella Jaisinghani
---||Aurangabad||Reforms in property tax collection||Aurangabad: The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation’s (AMC) annual budget presentation for the financial year 2020-21 saw some major reforms in the process to collect property tax. The local civic body, which has presented a budget of Rs 1,275.2 crore for the current fiscal, could collect only Rs 115 crore towards property tax last year with around Rs 150 crore still pending. Talking about the reforms, Aparna Thete, head of AMC’s task force for tax recovery, said the new property tax collection process would witness issuing of demand-notes to property holders at the start of fiscal. “With early distribution of demand-notes, we have set 50% recovery target of property tax by July itself. Every personnel associated with the ward-office will be given a target to cover 1,500 to 2,000 properties for the purpose of tax recovery. In short, the tax recovery process will be intensified at the beginning of the financial year unlike the last quarter as observed in past,” she said. Thete said the process of recovering outstanding dues towards property tax would be separated from the collection of tax for ongoing fiscal. “Every property holder can pay his dues over a period of three years. The first instalment of 30% need to be paid along with tax for ongoing fiscal, followed by 30% and 40% installment over a period of next two years. The reform aims at avoiding the financial burden faced by the property holders,” she said. The municipal limit of Aurangabad has around 2.6 lakh registered property holders to whom the overhauled tax recovery process will be applicable from the current fiscal. Multi-storey parking, amusement parks While presenting the annual budget, AMC administrator Astik Kumar made some special allocations including that for creating a multi-storey parking at Paithan Gate, building amusement parks at different city gardens and development of roads. The annual budget also has a mention of promotion of non-conventional sources of energy and earning through sale of treated water from sewage treatment plants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/reforms-in-property-tax-collection/articleshow/81852480.cms||Prasad Joshi

Campaigning for BJP candidate K Annamalai at Aravakurichi, Shah said, “Our alliance wants the progress of Tamil Nadu and youth in the state to get employment. But DMK leader M K Stalin wants his son Udhayanidhi Stalin to become chief minister of Tamil Nadu. I ask people whether you want growth or Udhayanidhi Stalin.” He said the Prime Minister has made special allocation of Rs 1.60 lakh crore in the recent budget towards the progress of Tamil Nadu. At Velayuthampalayam, where he held a road show, Shah said he had come there to show his gratitude “for the love people of Aravakurichi have showered on BJP and our candidate Annamalai.” He appealed to voters to give a resounding victory for Annamalai calling him "the most honest candidate in the poll fray across Tamil Nadu". The road show turned out to be a confluence of BJP cadres from Karnataka and Tamil Nadu with a sizable number of supporters being from Karnataka. People were brought in from neighbouring villages on mini trucks. As the vehicle carrying Shah began to move, Annamalai told the crowd that “the Iron man of India who you would have seen only on TV is amongst you.” G Uzhavan Vijay, 34, Namakkal youth wing secretary, said it was tough to educate people on BJP as many were not aware that Annamalai is contesting on lotus symbol as they were habituated to DMK or AIADMK. S Panchavarnam, 37, from Aravakurichi who came wearing a sari with BJP’s colours for the road show, had voted for DMK in the last election. “Annamalai was good at his job as a police officer. He has come here leaving his job to do good to his native place," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/stalin-wants-to-make-udhayanidhi-cm-shah/articleshow/81861476.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Hyderabad||T govt to crack the whip on illegal land schemes||Hyderabad: Cracking the whip for the first time on developers illegally selling undivided share (UDS) of land in realty projects, the Telangana State Real Estate Regulatory Authority (TS-RERA), on Thursday, said that such sales will attract severe punishment – up to 10% of the total project cost. The decision was taken following a meeting with industry representatives and other senior officials. “It has come to the notice that certain promoters/builders/developers are advertising/marketing/selling units in un-divided share of lands in projects to be launched/constructed at nominal/discounted prices. This is not consonance with Section 3 (1) & 4 (1) of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 and Rule 1 (2) of the Telangana State Real Estate (Regulation & Development) Rules, 2017,” read a circular issued by Somesh Kumar, chairman, TS-RERA. It added: “...sale of UDS lands without prior registration of the project with TS-RERA, shall attract penalty up to 10% of the total project cost under Section 59 of the RERA Act, 2016.” The issue of mushrooming UDS projects was highlighted by TOI earlier this year after industry insiders termed them as “ponzi schemes” floated to cheat buyers of their money. Under this scheme, a customer is sold a small share of land from a larger land parcel – like 100 square yards from a 10-acre property – for an upfront payment, ranging between Rs 30 lakh and Rs 50 lakh bracket (on an average). Against this purchase, the buyer is promised a constructed home/apartment, once the entire land parcel is developed. While these projects, as per the various sections of the RERA Act, need to be cleared by concerned authorities, market observers say that a majority of them have no permissions in place. Apart from warning defaulting builders, the latest circular issued by the RERA chairman also cautioned the general public against buying such flats/plots/units as they carry “a high risk of getting cheated by such promoters/developers/builders”. The directive has been welcomed by Hyderabad’s realty sector players who say that strict measures are important to protect the image of ‘brand Hyderabad’. “It will not only help genuine developers and the industry as a whole, but also protect buyers from getting duped. It is extremely pertinent that the government comes down strongly on those indulging in such offenders,” said P Ramakrishna Rao, president, Credai-Hyderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-govt-to-crack-the-whip-on-illegal-land-schemes/articleshow/81861470.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Rahul Shrirame said on Thursday, “We have opened a small traffic office at Kesnanad Phata in Lonikand. The work for opening another traffic office on an open land allotted by the Loni Kalbhor gram panchayat is expected to be complete by the weekend.” Shrirame said, “After Lonikand and Loni Kalbhor police stations were merged in the Pune police limits recently, we received manpower of 10 policemen each for manning traffic at the two places.” The DCP said, “Wagholi, a suburb under Lonikand police, is the most affected because of rapid urbanisation and round-the-clock movement of heavy vehicles.” The traffic chief said, “We conducted a survey for assessing traffic situation at the two places and identified 11 chowks each requiring immediate attention.” Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta said, “The temporary traffic offices will be converted into full-fledged traffic divisions in three months. We will also open crime branch and special branch offices and create other infrastructure like opening police outposts and providing sufficient number of vehicles for controlling crime and maintaining law and order in rural Pune.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/makeshift-traffic-offices-to-control-22-busy-chowks/articleshow/81858440.cms||Asseem Shaikh

Analysis of daily active cases reveal that the daily cases tripled in just a fortnight –from 205 on March 15 to 606 on March 30. Ahmedabad district had test positivity rate (TPR) of 3.2% on Friday, the third highest among four districts of Gujarat with maximum cases. Vadodara had the highest TPR of 6% — finding six cases every 100 tests conducted — followed by Rajkot (3.6%). Surat had TPR of 2.1% as it conducted the maximum tests at 29,984 followed by Ahmedabad (19,963). “There’s surely a correlation between the tests conducted and the daily positive cases. While Friday recorded the highest daily tally, it also recorded highest daily tests at 1.07 lakh. Thus, it gives state TPR of 2.5%,” said a city-based epidemiologist. “The four major cities account for 65% of the total cases. The other districts are also recording surge.” With vaccination opened for the population above 45 years, Ahmedabad city recorded vaccination of 32,913 whereas Surat city recorded vaccination of 57,040. “With rise in the daily cases, there is surely better awareness about vaccination and higher rush for inoculation. We are hopeful of continuing the pace of inoculating over 4 lakh daily,” said a senior health department official. Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association website revealed that the city had 2,319 positive patients hospitalized, giving the occupancy rate of 70%.

Mutharasan was addressing a public meeting at Woraiyur in Trichy as part of the campaign for DMK candidate for Trichy West constituency K N Nehru on Thursday. Mutharasan said that Modi was heading the AIADMK alliance and not EPS as he was under the clutches of Modi. Mutharasan spoke at length on the three new farm laws, NEET and issues related to labours and criticized the BJP government at the Centre over its steps on those matters.

According to estimates, this category will include more than 1 crore persons. “Thus, with adequate vaccine shots in hand, the drive will be expanded both in cities and rural areas alike,” said a senior health department official. Officials pointed to the increase in daily cases as one of the factors that has led to a spike in vaccinations in the past few days. While daily cases have risen by of 23% in a week, vaccination increased by 27% in the same period. Health department officials said they are still compiling figures for vaccination for persons older than 45 years, but the response has been good. “Several organizations are also holding special camps for employees and stakeholders to get vaccinated. High levels of vaccination will be one way to ensure herd immunity,” said an official, adding that about 8% of the state’s population has got the first shot whereas 6.98 lakh persons have got complete vaccination or both doses.

The employees brought it to the notice of the manager. Further investigation revealed that the four men had tampered with the machine. “As soon as they had opted for the withdrawal, cash Rs19,500 was dispensed but the gang simultaneously went behind the machine and tampered with it after which the debited amount was not reflected in the bank account,” SI Umashankari told TOI on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/4-arrested-for-bid-to-tamper-with-atm/articleshow/81861566.cms||Gokul Rajendran

Nikhil Mhetre, a parent who received such a message late at night on March 30, said he had filled up the admission form for his daughter and had downloaded the confirmation letter and also taken a printout. “When I received this message, 15 minutes or so before the deadline for the RTE applications, I panicked. The next day, I immediately went to the ZP office. There were four other parents with similar complaints. We presented our case to the officer who told us that he would look into the matter. We went to the Pune Municipal Corporation’s RTE office and submitted our application. The official there assured us that the matter will be resolved. By evening, I had received another message saying that the form has been confirmed. A probe should be ordered to see if the system was hacked into because there is a huge rush to get RTE seats in the city now,” Mhetre said. Pune Zilla Parishad education officer Sunil Kurhade said many parents had the same complaint, and they had received a message stating that their forms have been deleted. “We informed the director of primary education about it who said that he has sought a report from the organisation conducting the admission process. We need to know how it happened, from which IP address the messages were sent, and other questions. We will wait for the orders from the director’s office about further action. Parents have been told not to worry. We resolved the problems of the applicants by changing the status of the form from deleted to confirmed,” Kurhade said. Vaishali Pandhare, in-charge of RTE admissions in Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), said she has received at least 15 complaints. “But when we checked the system, we found 30 such cases where forms were shown as deleted, after confirmation. We have reversed the status and confirmed them again. Meanwhile, I would appeal to parents, who have received a message about the form being deleted, despite confirmation during the application process must visit the respective local body with proof.”  This year, the admission process has been prolonged due to the pandemic .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/education-dept-seeks-report-on-deletion-of-rte-forms/articleshow/81858527.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Kolkata||Bengal assembly polls: Desperate Modi peddling false information, says TMC||KOLKATA: Trinamool on Thursday called Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s jibe that chief minister Mamata Banerjee had “conceded defeat” in Nandigram “laughable and weird”, and questioned why he was trying to influence voters in Nandigram. “We would urge the Prime Minister not to denigrate his chair and hope he refrains from such things in future,” former Union minister Yashwant Sinha, also a Trinamool vice-president, told reporters at Trinamool Bhawan. “Chief minister Mamata Banerjee is winning with a huge majority in Nandigram and is set to return to form the government with 200-plus seats. A desperate BJP is peddling lies and misinformation. We demand that the PM withdraws his statement and apologizes,” said Trinamool MP Sukhendu Sekhar Ray. “BJP’s claim of winning 80% of the 60 seats that went to polls on Phase 1 and 2 is laughable. Even if they win 25%-30% of the seats (in the two phases) they should consider themselves lucky.” Party MP Derek O’ Brien dubbed the PM’s statement a “cheap shot”. “If they are so in love with Bengal, why doesn’t the PM or home minister file a nomination from here? There is still time for the last date for the last phase of the elections,” he said. Ray, who along with other party seniors, has been camping in Nandigram, said, “The BJP has played all its tricks. Central forces and police hounded our party leadership. Even on Thursday, party poll agents were not allowed in a few booths. Despite this, the CM will win with a huge majority and her opponents will have no face to hide. A lot of women have voted for her.” “A lot was said about section 144, deployment of central forces in Nandigram. Still, we saw what happened. Attempt by outsiders to instigate violence were stopped in a people’s resistance. The BJP and its candidate, sensing imminent defeat, have become desperate,” Ray said. Sinha said, “The EC usually bans publicity and campaigns 36 hours before polls. But with campaigning being allowed in other places, any statement made elsewhere will reach the people casting their votes at a faraway constituency. When the Prime Minister referred to Nandigram, what message was he trying to send out? Was he trying to influence voters? Doesn’t he have any faith in the people in Nandigram?” Trinamool MP Mahua Maitra tweeted: “Contesting from second seat? Yes Mr Prime Minister, she will. And it will be Varanasi! So, go get your armour on.” Sinha said, “I am awaiting Amit Shah’s prediction about the 30 seats going to polls on Thursday. Will it be 35 or 40 out of 30, for BJP? After the 3rd phase, he may declare BJP has secured a majority and there is no need for further phases. EC will agree.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-desperate-modi-peddling-false-info/articleshow/81861621.cms||---

The hike comes after a recommendation from a panel of six members of the health department took stock of the situation and tabled its report. In its report, the panel said it was difficult to provide healthy food at Rs 50 because of the rise in prices. It also said patients suffering from TB and cancer require healthy food along with proper treatment. Notably, the state-run MGMMCH and sadar hospital provide food three times which included breakfast, lunch and dinner. In 2013, the amount was Rs 30, which was later increased to Rs 50. Patients admitted to the two hospitals regularly complained that they are denied proper food and a clean environment. Ramesh, a patient admitted to the orthopaedic ward of MGMMCH, said the food served currently has no taste and often not properly cooked.

Deputy commissioner Chhavi Ranjan met representatives of the hospitals at the Collectorate Building and also urged them to stick to tariffs which were set by the state health department in the peak of the pandemic last year. The hospital managements were also asked to maintain a database of Covid-19 patients who are being admitted to their facilities. “With Covid-19 cases declining, most of the private hospitals reduced their designated beds. In the meeting today (Thursday), the administration urged the hospitals to ensure that each hospital prepares to increase their beds to the levels during the peak of the pandemic,” said Yogesh Gambhir, state president of Association of Health Providers. As per estimates, most hospitals had pruned their Covid-19 beds to 25% from September last year in a phased manner as cases began declining. After Thursday’s meeting, the hospitals are likely to add at least 500 oxygen-supported beds in cumulative. In an order earlier this week, the district administrations have been directed to ensure that serious patients, patients with comorbidities and mildly symptomatic patients are hospitalised. The hospitals were also asked to adhere to the ceiling on bed charges which had been put in place by the state health department last year. As per the ceiling, patients on ventilator support will have to pay up to Rs 18,000 a day as bed and hospital charges. Patients with moderate illnesses will have to pay in between Rs 8,000 to Rs 12,000 each day. “Private labs were directed to adhere to the testing charges fixed by the government. There were a few reports of some city-based diagnostic labs charging more than the ceiling. This issue was also discussed,” another participant at the meeting said. Notably, the department has capped RT-PCR charges at Rs 400 per test. In case the samples are collected from homes, the patient has to pay Rs 200 extra. On Wednesday, incidents came to light that several private labs are charging Rs 700 per test.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/pvt-hosps-told-to-follow-cov-tariffs-fixed-by-govt/articleshow/81858090.cms||---

Two accused were arrested on Thursday. The septuagenarian, Ranthu Munda, a native of Parsa–Navatoli village under Raidih police station, was killed after being dragged out of his house by five men around 10:30pm on Wednesday night. Raidih police said the deceased practised exorcism and sold herbal medicines. Nitish Kumar, the officer-in-charge of Raidih police station, said two of the five men accused in Ranthu’s murder were arrested on Thursday. The duo has been identified as Sudhir Munda (20) and Balram Munda (21). Kumar said Sudhir and Balram are cousins and they have confessed to their crime. “Sudhir’s sister Sangeeta, who was suffering from filaria for the last few months, died on March 29. After Sangeeta’s death, Ranthu allegedly told the duo that they needed to perform a special exorcism in their house to prevent other members of the family from falling ill. Later, the duo suspected that Ranthu may have killed Sangeeta through witchcraft and decided to kill him,” Kumar said, quoting the duo’s confession statement.

---||Ranchi||Sahebganj tribals block road to protest illegal stone mining||KOLKATA: Tribal residents of Gadwa Hills in Taljhari block of Sahebganj district on Thursday blocked the main road leading to the hills in protest against the illegal stone mines that have mushroomed in the ecologically sensitive area over the years. The protesters, who submitted a memorandum to the local administration, said the dust emanating from the quarries are a health hazard, causing tuberculosis and other diseases, and also destroys their crops. The protesters also demanded the administration to sprinkle water on the main road as scores of trucks ferrying stone from the quarries increase pollution. One of the protesters, Ravi Tudu, said, “The deafening noise from the blasts makes it difficult for us to live here. The area is often covered in a blanket of dust.” Another protester, Mary Tudu, said, “We often find layers of dust on our drinking water and food. Our crops are getting damaged and hardly any tree bears fruit these days.” Speaking to TOI, JMM’s Borio MLA Lobin Hembrom, who had recently organized rallies against illegal mining, said, “In Gadwa Hills area, the main problem is that the dust pollution is leading to silt deposition in water bodies.” Asked if he is expecting the state government to take corrective steps, Hembrom said, “If the people wants to stop such illegal practices, the government will have to listen to them. I have raised my voice in the assembly, but the government doesn’t seem to be paying attention to the menace. After the Madhupur bypoll, I will intensify the protests and ensure justice for the raiyats who have lost their lands to illegal mining activities.” Talking about the importance of the hills, assistant professor at Sahebganj PG College Ranjit Kumar Singh said, “The area acts as a natural lab for geologists. Illegal mining has disturbed the ecological balance and biodiversity of the area. These mines are also snatching away the natural habitat of tribals who rely on forest covers for their livelihood.” “It takes thousands of years for a hill to take shape and if such practices are not stopped immediately, what will be left for the future generations? Illegal mining should be stopped and the government should take steps to scientifically extract stone from the hills so that fossils that are found in large numbers here and help in geological studies are not destroyed,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/sahebganj-tribals-block-road-to-protest-illegal-stone-mining/articleshow/81857823.cms||Utsav Basu
---||Ranchi||Madhupur will be a rerun of Tamar 2009, claims Babulal||RANCHI: Former Jharkhand chief minister Babulal Marandi on Thursday claimed that the Madhupur bye-election will be a rerun of the 2009 Tamar bypoll. “I have said this on March 30, and I will repeat it again. In 2009, the then chief minister (Shibu Soren) had to resign after he lost in the Tamar bypoll. On May 2, the incumbent minister (Hafizul Hassan) will have to resign after he loses in Madhupur,” Marandi told reporters at the BJP state headquarters here. Shibu had to resign from the CM’s post in January 2009 after he was handed a shock defeat by his opponent Gopal Krishna Patar (Raja Peter). Patar defeated Shibu by over 9,000 votes. Hassan, the elder son of late minister and JMM stalwart Haji Hussain Ansari, was sworn in as a minister in February, a month before the bypoll was announced. He is up against BJP’s Ganga Narayan Singh. Marandi, however, distanced himself from BJP’s Godda MP Nishikant Dubey’s statement. Addressing a public meeting before Singh’s nomination, Dubey had allegedly announced that BJP would form the government in Jharkhand by May 10 if Singh won the election. “A lot of people will say a lot of things, but I will not comment on his statement,” Marandi said. Marandi said he was surprised by news reports which claimed that Jharkhand government had managed to spend 75% of its budgetary allocations for the 2020-21 FY. “After going through the papers, I rang up officers of the finance department to get a clearer picture. They said nearly 83% of the Budget has been spent. How can that be possible if the government claimed all the while that its coffers were empty, and it was not getting money from the Centre?” Marandi said. “Like the Budget document, the government must issue a document detailing its expenditures,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/madhupur-will-be-a-rerun-of-tamar-2009-claims-babulal/articleshow/81857913.cms||---
---||India||#Oversight draws protests & mirth||NEW DELHI: #Oversight drew mirth and protests to become a Twitter trend on Thursday. Among those who tweeted using the hashtag were Rahul Gandhi and former finance ministers P Chidambaram and Yashwant Sinha, who mock-lamented that he had lost monopoly of the term, “rollback”. The comments started coming thick and fast after finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman tweeted around 8am on Thursday, “Interest rates of small savings schemes of GoI shall continue to be at the rates which existed in the last quarter of 2020-2021, ie, rates that prevailed as of March 2021. Orders issued by oversight shall be withdrawn.” #Oversight was one of the top trends with over 16k tweets around 4pm. Some users also pointed out the irony of reversal on April 1, known as All Fool’s Day. Chidambaram wrote, “The BJP government had decided to launch another assault on the middle class by slashing the interest rates and profiting itself. When caught, the FM is putting forward the lame excuse of “inadvertent error”. Announcement of interest rates on savings instruments for the next quarter is a regular exercise. There is nothing “inadvertent” about its release on 31st March.” Congress leader Rahul Gandhi posted, “There was already a loot on petrol and diesel. Now, as soon as the elections will be over, the interest on small savings will reduce, making the middle class suffer again. Jumlo ki jhoot ki, ye sarkar janta se loot ki (This government only loots the public and diverts attention by making fake promises!) #Oversight.” Congress’ Salman Soz imitating the manner in which the circular was issued, made a surprise statement. “I am joining BJP,” he wrote at 9.20am. Half an hour later, he clarified, “This tweet was due to an oversight. It is withdrawn,” he posted at 9.48am.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/oversight-draws-protests-mirth/articleshow/81865849.cms||Anam Ajmal

On April 1, there were 84 fire alerts in the state, according to Forest Survey of India (FSI). Though such fires are common ahead of tendu leaves plucking season, forest officials said these fires were ignited by the locals for the collection of mahua flowers. Their gravity can be gauged from the fact that there were 34,724 fire alerts from March 1 to 21. From March 22 to April 1, another 1102 fire alerts have been sounded in Maharashtra. The forest fires have increased in the last eight days with vast stretches still blazing in Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, Kolhapur, Thane, Kolhapur, and Yavatmal circles. The worst-affected seem to be Gadchiroli and Chandrapur circles. There were 14,966 fire alerts in Gadchiroli and 3,970 in Chandrapur. On Wednesday, fire devasted large parts of Ghodazari wildlife sanctuary under Bramhapuri division in Chandrapur Circle. The sanctuary is adjoining Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) and is home to resident tigers and also acts as a corridor to Umred-Karhandla and Navegaon-Nagzira. Wildlife lover Ashish Ghume and others said while traveling towards Sindewahi from Nagbhid, entire forest stretches for 10km on both sides of the road had turned into ash. “The fires in Ghodazari reached the inviolate hillocks inside the park and no fire-fighters were around,” said Ghume. Chandrapur CCF NR Pravin said, “There is fire in Ghodazari but entire sanctuary is not ablaze. Fires seen outside also include agriculture fields and hence they look bigger. We have booked some elements for starting fires for mahua collection.” However, Pravin failed to give data on offences registered and the total area burnt. Fire incidents have been reported since January and have gone up manifold in March. Suresh Chopne, president, Green Planet Society, said, “Forest firest have become common owing to high temperatures and this being tendu and mahua collection season. No one is held accountable despite the government spending crores of rupees on fire blowers, men and material. These fires affect regeneration of forests. Fires emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that will continue to warm the planet well into the future. These fires not only damage trees but displace wildlife and create a shortage of food for them.” Compared to three wildlife areas, Melghat tiger reserve reported fewer number (306) fire incidents since January-March this year, while during the same period Nagpur wildlife (east) covering Pench, Navegaon-Nagzira, Tadoba core & buffer, Allapalli reported 861 alerts and wildlife (west) 812 incidents. “Active involvement of local tribals and communities by encouraging them with award money has borne fruits in curbing forest fires Melghat,” said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fires-affect-swathes-of-forests-in-state-devastate-ghodazari-sanct/articleshow/81859035.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Congress spokesperson Rajeev Shukla said the government should provide a “guarantee” that it will not cut the interest rate any time after the polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/guarantee-that-rate-wont-be-cut-after-polls-congress/articleshow/81865853.cms||---
---||Nagpur||RFO herself headed complaints committee||Nagpur: Harisal RFO Deepali Chavan, who killed herself complaining of harassment by deputy conservator of forest, was herself heading the three-member internal complaint committee set up to investigate harassment of women at workplace. It appears even a woman in her position could not get her own case redressed within the department. There has been sharp criticism by political leaders, social organizations, and forest union leaders over activating the Vishaka committees meant to protect women from harassment at workplace in the department in the wake of her case. As per the letter issued on November 17, 2020, late Deepali was president of the three-member internal complaint committee that was set up at Harisal range under Section 4 of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition & Redressal) Act, enacted in 2013. Forest guards Vaishali Dore and Navita Khirale were members. Ironically, the letter was issued by deputy conservator Vinod Shivkumar, whom she named in her suicide note and who is accused of abetting her suicide. He has since been arrested by the police and placed under suspension. “If Deepali was president of the Internal Complaints Committee, she must have been aware of the provisions under the Act and should have filed a written complaint against Shivkumar with the field director’s office, which was not done. She suffered silently and was unable to take right steps,” said a section of officials and those saying Melghat field director MS Reddy has been unfairly targeted in the case. “Most importantly, Section 9 of the Act requires a complaint in writing by the aggrieved against sexual harassment. Even the claim of women and child development minister Yashomati Thakur made in a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray that the committee has not been constituted becomes hollow in the light of this,” said sources. Meanwhile, PCCF (HoFF) G Saiprakash has set up a nine-member committee to probe Deepali Chavan suicide case. PCCF (IT) MK Rao will head the committee while Amravati CCF Pravin Chavan will be the member-secretary. Four women forest officers CCF Mira Iyer Trivedi, DyCF Piyusha Jagtap, ACF Jyoti Pawar and retired DFO Kishore Mishrikotkar are members, along with one NGO. The committee will probe all the charges and allegations made by late Chavan in her suicide note.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rfo-herself-headed-complaints-committee/articleshow/81859158.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Some college principals told TOI that NU has even failed to provide hall tickets to external students, despite the fact that their exams are to begin from April 5. “Till date, we don’t have an idea of how many external students would be appearing from our college while the exams are just three days away. From tomorrow, NU will be closed due to continuous holidays for Good Friday, Saturday and Sunday. If they issue hall tickets on Monday, how are we supposed to conduct their papers? We also need some time for preparations to conduct the online exam,” they said. Besides external students, the colleges are also entrusted with conducting examinations of their postgraduate and undergraduate students, if their numbers are below 100. Refuting the charges, Board of Examinations and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable told TOI the university had sent hall tickets of third semester on Thursday and would be sending remaining second and fourth semesters by Friday. “We had also sent a list of external students along with hall tickets, who will appear from the colleges. The college management is advised to conduct exams of all external, PG and UG students in online, offline and hybrid mode, as per their own convenience as well as the students. We had issued a circular in this regard,” he said. The colleges, however, complained that the university didn’t pay them a penny for holding these exams. They advised NU to simultaneously conduct papers of all colleges at same time to maintain transparency. They’re also of the opinion that NU should prepare the same question papers for all of them. The BOEE director, however, said that NU had provided a time slot to the colleges from April 1 to 10 to complete their quota of exams. Box NU to fete CJI at convocation hall In view of Covid-19 second wave and rising cases in the city, NU has changed the venue to confer Doctor of Law (LLD) on Chief Justice of India Sharad Bobde from Deshpande Hall to its own convocation hall on April 11. VC Subhash Chaudhari told TOI that NU had started preparations in this regard, but the CJI was yet to confirm the dates. “He would be coming to the city to inaugurate National Law University’s (NLU) academic block at Waranga on Wardha Road on April 10, but we’re yet to get any confirmation from his side,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/external-students-yet-to-get-hall-tickets/articleshow/81859218.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Nagpur||FIR gaffe leads to mistaken arrest of innocent||Nagpur: An error in the First Information Report (FIR) disrupted the life of an innocent man, rounded up by Wadi police from Arni, Yavatmal earlier this week. The man, identified as ‘Shukla’, was enjoying Holi celebrations at his in-laws’ place when he was picked up. Shukla was rounded up for questioning after the registration number of his car got mistakenly included in the FIR of a six-year-old girl’s molestation, instead of that of the actual perpetrator. The offence was registered following a complaint from a woman whose daughter claimed to have been shown an objectionable video by a man inside a car, when she was playing outside her house. The car’s registration number was included in the FIR after scrutiny of the CCTV footage which had captured the incident. One of the digits in the number plate got erroneously changed, which led to the blunder. Wadi police immediately released the man along with his car, allowing him to rejoin family and expressing their gratitude for his cooperation, shortly after it came to the fore that the basis of their action was incorrect. Re-working on the case’s details after rectifying the error, Wadi police intercepted the actual suspect’s car from Ravi Nagar. The driver of the car, Manish Yadav, was placed under arrest on Wednesday. Being a driver, Yadav was in the possession of someone else’s car. Another 8-year-old shown porn An eight-year-old girl was shown a porn clip by a neighbour, identified as Shaikh, following which an offence was registered at Ajni police station on Wednesday. The girl stayed with her mother at a rented place. Shaikh operates a maintenance workshop of water filters from an adjoining room. The girl had stepped into Shaikh’s room in a playful manner when he allegedly showed her some porn clips and also exposed his body. After learning about it, the girl’s father approached Ajni police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fir-gaffe-leads-to-mistaken-arrest-of-innocent/articleshow/81859269.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||Noisepur: Decibel levels high at most places in city||Nagpur: Only one location in the city was found to have noise levels within the prescribed permissible limit, reveals a scientific study carried out for the city’s latest environmental status report (ESR).Prepared by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri), the report analyses the level of noise pollution in the city. To assess this, the institute carried out an innovative approach by using bicycles with mounted sound meters to monitor decibels levels in the city. According to scientists, the purpose of monitoring by this method was to identify noise pollution at large number of locations in the city for better representation and monitoring in congested areas. As per the norms of Union environment ministry, the permissible noise limit in industrial areas is 75dB during day and 70dB at night. In commercial areas, it is 65 and 55 dB while for residential areas it is 55 and 45 dB, respectively.Out of 700 sampling sites, 374 sites had noise levels greater than 80 dB, while 325 sampling sites had a noise level between 60-80 dB. “Only one sampling position was found where the noise level was below 60 dB. This shows that majority of the sampling sites are affected by high noise levels,” the study stated.These 700 sampling locations comprised of different road categories like national and state highways, ring road, major road, minor road, railway crossing and different land-use categories including residential, commercial and industrial. At each location, the cycle was stopped and noise levels were recorded for five minutes with an interval of one second during peak hours of traffic – mainly from 9 to 11 am and 6-8.30 pm. At every location, 300 readings were recorded.Stating that the situation is alarming in the city, senior principal scientist Ritesh Vijay said, “Just one location has noise levels below 60dB, majority of them have levels crossing 100 dB. The main cause behind this is the exponential growth in the number of vehicles in the city between 2005-2020.”According to him, mitigation measures need to be taken. “Honking should be speed-based. People honk with the same intensity even when the vehicle is not in motion,” he added.Earlier, a study conducted by Neeri had revealed that honking contributes additional 2 to 5 decibels in the cumulative vehicular noise pollution in the city. During the study, maximum honking was observed on highways.IN A NUTSHELL* Bicycles mounted with sound meters used for study* Helped cover many parts of city * 700 sites scanned * Noise levels at 374 sites greater than 80 dB, at 325 between 60-80 dB* Only 1 site below 60* CONCLUSION: Majority of sampling sites affected by high noise levels* SOLUTION: Honking should be speed based||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/noisepur-decibel-levels-high-at-most-places-in-city/articleshow/81859324.cms||Manka Behl

Police said Asad Khan, 50, was travelling on a motorbike with a pillion rider, Nazar, when six men in a speeding autorickshaw dashed them from behind, throwing Khan off balance. CCTV footage obtained by police showed how four-six people got down from the auto and hacked Khan with sickles and axes, killing him on the spot. A bystander also made a video of the victim, who was a small-time AIMIM party worker, being killed and it has since gone viral. Nazar also sustained injuries. He was treated at a local hospital and released. The footage further shows the killers throwing a knife on the road and speeding away in the auto, even as shocked people watched from a distance. “Khan was an accused in the murder of one Amjad in Shastripuram area in 2018. Today he was travelling from Teegalkunta, where his first wife resides, to Shama Colony in Mailardevpally, where his second wife stays,” a senior police official probing the case said. Police are checking whether Khan’s murder is a case of revenge killing. Preliminary probe revealed that Amjad’s son had got married to Khan’s daughter, but the marriage did not last long and the couple got separated. “Enraged by the separation, Khan had allegedly killed Amjad,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/aimim-backer-businessman-hacked-to-death-on-hyderabad-street/articleshow/81865868.cms||---

After expiry of former members’ tenure on April 30, 2020, the Maharashtra government has failed to appoint new members on it for nearly a year. A division bench of Justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote on Thursday issued notices to top bureaucrats of central and state governments asking them to reply in two weeks. Petitioners Nitin Ronghe and Kapil Chandrayan, a former Vidarbha Statutory Development Board (VSDB) member, contended that the Article 371(2) was a special responsibility, solely within discretion of Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and he couldn’t shirk it on the pretext that he’s waiting for cabinet’s recommendation. Senior counsel Shreehari Aney and Akshaya Sudame, appearing for the petitioners, pointed out towards deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar’s statement that the cabinet would reconstitute development boards only if the governor accepted proposed names of 12 persons for vacant MLC seats. “Such inaction on the governor’s part to reconstitute these boards amounted to failure of constitutional machinery which would call for imposition of President’s rule in the state,” they argued. The petitioners prayed for directives to the governor’s office to immediately constitute the development boards, failing which direct the Central government to take steps for imposing President’s rule under Article 356 of the Constitution of India. Assistant solicitor general Ulhas Aurangabadkar appeared for the Centre while government pleader Ketki Joshi pleaded for the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/plea-in-hc-seeks-prez-rule-in-state/articleshow/81859326.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||India||After 16 yrs, India’s widest e-way Delhi-Meerut Expressway opens||NEW DELHI: The Delhi-Meerut Expressway, the project conceived 16 years back to reduce travel time between two cities to barely 45 minutes, became a reality on Thursday as the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) threw open the fully access controlled expressway to the public. This was part of the National Highway Development Project-VI, approved by the Cabinet in 2006 to build 1,000kms of four and six-lane expressways in high-density parts of the country. Announcing the opening of the expressway, which also includes the widest highway stretch with 14 lanes in the country, Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari tweeted, “Delhi-Meerut Expressway has now been completed and opened to traffic. We have fulfilled our promise of reducing travel time between Delhi and Meerut from 2.5 hours to 45 minutes.” Delhi Meerut Expressway has now been completed & opened to traffic. We have full filled our promise of reducing tra… https://t.co/ZAhu0tGIje— Nitin Gadkari (@nitin_gadkari) 1617250673000This expressway will reduce the travel time from Delhi to Haridwar and Dehradun drastically as commuters can now take this road instead of the congested Delhi-Modi Nagar-Meerut highway, which was earlier known as NH-58. During review of the progress of the project in February, NHAI had assured Prime Minister Narendra Modi to complete it by March-end. Sources said the PM had asked whether he should believe that there would be no more extension of the deadline. “Finally, we have made the entire stretch operational for a seamless journey. The project has undergone a sea change since it was first planned and approved. Now this expressway can meet the requirement of 20-30 years as seamless travel will increase the throughput. Actual work started in early 2015. It took a long time due to non-availability of land and other statutory clearances,” said a government official. This would be the first highway stretch of NHAI in an urban area where user fee (toll) will be charged for using only the access controlled or barricaded corridor, which means those using the service roads won’t pay the toll charge, the official said. To make the tolling smoother, NHAI will deploy the automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cum FASTag-based multi-lane free flow tolling system, which will use high definition cameras to read the number plate and automatically deduct the toll amount from the FASTag. A special Emergency Call Box (ECB) provision has been made for timely approach at the time of emergency for the road users.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-16-yrs-indias-widest-e-way-opens/articleshow/81865848.cms||Dipak K Dash

Earlier, in yet another jolt to power minister and Curchorem MLA Nilesh Cabral — he had already faced the ignominy of several of his candidates losing to independents in the recently-concluded Curchorem Cacora municipal elections — BJP Curchorem mandal president Vishwas Sawant was defeated by ‘independent’ Hodarkar for the elections held for the chairperson’s post. Sawant, who was openly backed by Cabral, was defeated 7-8 in the 15-member council by a secret ballot at the first meeting of the council that also saw Cabral in attendance. Strangely, Sawant, who led the others in moving the no-confidence motion against Hodarkar, said that the reason behind the move was to identify the councillors who had “betrayed” Cabral. “Eleven of us belonged to the panel supported by Cabral. We were left with 10 after Hodarkar filed his nomination for the chairperson’s post. As I secured only 7 votes, it’s obvious that three from our panel betrayed Cabral. We need to find out who these betrayers are, and hence this no-confidence motion,” Sawant said. However, with all 10 councillors from the Cabral-panel signing the motion, the identity of the “betrayers” still remains a mystery. The no-confidence motion is, however, silent on why Hodarkar lost the trust of the 10 councillors less than 30 minutes after they had voted him to office. Significantly, Rhucha Vasta, who was elected as vice chairperson, unopposed, tendered her resignation from the post after she signed the no-confidence motion. Other signatories to the motion, besides Sawant and Vasta, are – Jasmine Braganza, Pramod Naik, Reema Alise, Yolanda Pereira, Tony Coutinho, Carmelina Morais, Damodar Bhende and Sushant Naik. After Congress turned BJP MLA Clafasio Dias had said that BJP would form the council last week, Alemaos had kept the nine councillors in a hotel in Margao fearing poaching attempts by the rival group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/head-of-curchorem-civic-body-faces-no-trust-motion-soon-after-being-elected/articleshow/81862835.cms||---

Addressing an orientation programme for the newly-elected mayors, deputy mayors, chairpersons, and vice-chairpersons, the chief minister said their elevation was a gift to serve the society. “Ensure transparency in your functioning and focus on developing your respective municipalities and corporations. The faith reposed by people in you has further increased your responsibility,” he said. Congratulating the newly-elected civic chiefs, Jagan advised them to stay away from discrimination and corruption. “I want to remind you that you are the representatives for nearly 30 per cent of the state’s population. Never before in the country has any state government paved the way for social justice by giving 67 posts to SC, ST, BC and minority communities and appointing 52 women as mayors, deputy mayors, chairpersons and vice-chairpersons,” he added. Stating that providing sanitation, drinking water and housing to people in urban areas is the top priority of the state government, he said safe drinking water has to be made available to every household. Works related to water distribution network are in progress in 53 municipalities across the state, he said. The chief minister reiterated that his government has spent Rs 1 lakh crore towards welfare schemes within a span of 22 months with zero corruption and zero discrimination. “All government schools and hospitals in the state are being revamped with better infrastructure facilities under Nadu-Nedu initiative. Rythu Bharosa Kendras have been set up at the village level to help farmers,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ensure-transparency-cm-tells-civic-chiefs/articleshow/81856575.cms||Gopi Dara

Sardesai termed the sequence of events that unfolded in the CCMC on Thursday as a “total murder of democracy”. He added that the episode also exposed Curchorem MLA Nilesh Cabral’s claims of winning the CCMC elections as “empty bluster with no substance”. He accused Cabral of “forcing” the 10 councillors to sign a no-confidence motion.“This action of the minister has put paid to the BJP’s pretence of belief in democratic principles. He should explain to the people of Goa why he forced the councillors to sign a motion of no-confidence when the newly-elected chairperson had not even taken charge. The lack of confidence, if acceptable, should be in his performance as chairperson and in a situation where he has not even started working, Cabral’s dadagiri cannot be accepted,” Sardesai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/this-is-murder-of-democracy-sardesai/articleshow/81862892.cms||---

Amita Pagi of ward 5 (Kindlem) has been elected vice chairperson of the council. There were two nominations for the post of chairperson and an equal number for the vice-chairperson’s post. Both, Rebello and Pagi, polled 7-5 votes. The elections were held on Thursday at the municipal office. The interesting thing is that, on Tuesday, all the councillors were invited to meet chief minister Pramod Sawant and the party leadership in Panaji. However, only five councillors had gone for the meeting. Mastimol councillor Dhiraj Naik Gaonkar said that the party leaders specifically told them to file their nominations for the two posts. Hence, Gaonkar said that he filed his nomination for the post of chairperson while Supriya Desai, who won from the Delem ward, filed her nomination for the post of deputy chairperson. To stir matter further, while Rebello and six councillors insist that they are loyal to BJP and Canacona MLA Isidore Fernandes, Gaonkar insists that they were asked to file their nominations for the respective posts by the party leadership. Gaonkar said that while all had been called to meet the chief minister and the party leadership, only five were allowed to meet them. BJP state president Sadanand Tanavade and BJP organising secretary Satish Dhond were confused and sought to know why a faction had been created now when all twelve councillors had met them soon after the results. Though Rebello and his deputy won the elections as chairperson and vice chairperson, doubts have been raised as to whether the present council will last for more than three months. With some councillors showing signs of dissent, political analysts say that the present council may have to face the challenging task of keeping the flock of seven together.  Rebello, when asked about his priorities as chairperson, said that besides the garbage issue there were several other matters, like lack of tourism facilities, and the fish market, that needed to be addressed. Those others who supported Rebello besides Pagi are Ramakant Naik Gaonkar, Gandesh Madgaonkar, Sara Shamba Naik Desai, Narciso Fernandes and Laxman Pagi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/newly-elected-canacona-council-splits-into-factions/articleshow/81862938.cms||---

Addressing a conclave on ‘Transforming North Bengal – An Industry Vision’ organised by The Bengal Chamber of Commerce to discuss the various possibilities and factors that will determine the future of the region, Dhankar said North Bengal has enormous potential as it is the gateway to northeast. Deb A Mukherjee, president, The Bengal Chamber, said: “As a responsive business chamber, we need to balance economic growth without compromising environmental degradation for a region like North Bengal. We must preserve its rich bio-diversity and engage with the local ethnic communities." Former Governor of Tripura & Meghalaya Shri Tathagata Roy spoke on the importance of integrating North Bengal with North East growth ecosystem. tnn He pointed out that Integrating North East with North Bengal might sound great but it should translate to a developed North Bengal in terms of infrastructure and logistics. North Bengal is connected with the states of north east India. In spite of Act East policy of the government, North Bengal is underdeveloped as there is lack of vision and intent to improve things. To develop a countermagnet in Bengal, we need to develop Siliguri. There is tremendous potential of this place as it shares 4 international borders. Bagdogra airport needs expansion. Roads are in horrible condition, they are unmarked, accident prone. 4 lanes to 6 lane roads are required throughout to improve connectivity. Some strategic and holistic decision making is required. Expansion of bridge, bypasses to avoid jams, harnessing of hydro power potential, exploring food processing and cultivation of Jetropha, pineapple, jackfruit etc. need to be explored. Mr Yogdeep Gurung – Industrialist from North Bengal, Mr Ashutosh Jaiswal – President, International Business & Container Freight Services, CenturyPly, Mr Anoop Hoon – Chairperson, Marketing & Brand Committee, BCC&I and Dr Rabin Chakraborty – Chairperson, Health Committee, The Bengal Chamber participated on a panel Discussion on Transforming NB Key Points mentioned by the speakers: Shri Biswajit Mohinta: Key sectors that can be highlighted are food processing (example the mangoes of Malda have the potential to be a global brand), Healthcare services & health infrastructure, Higher education, agriculture, logistics- as North Bengal is the gateway to NE India. Mr Yogdeep Gurung – Many of the tea gardens are old plantations aging back to more than 50 years resulting in lower yield and low quality and thus arises the need for replanting. However due to scarcity of funds replanting is not taken up. The State and centre need to step in as there is need for financial subsidies to cover the cost of replanting. There is also a need for R&D. China produces 1000 variety of tea, however we have been using the tea technology left by the British. No innovation or no research has been done. Dr Rabin Chakraborty: Health tourism can be a major draw in this area but we need to improve infrastructure to get heath tourist. Bagdogra airport expansion could be a crucial factor to promote health tourism. India has shown a remarkable growth in medical tourism. Medical tourism is 3 billion dollar business in India. It could be increased to 8 billion dollars with a growth rate of 16% to 20% by incorporating Bengal along with North, south and West India by taking health infrastructure from Murshidabad and beyond. Value added services like Hospitality, pickup and drop services, embassy support, visa processing assistance, guest houses, interpreters, would be very helpful for development of medical tourism in North Bengal. Mr Ashutosh Jaiswal: 20 % of mangoes of Malda get rotten or damaged due to poor logistics. Food Processing Hubs have to be developed like Murshidabad silk hub to promote agro based industry. Marketing and branding is important to promote agro based industry. Mr Anoop Hoon: Integrated effort of all the stakeholders is required for a positive image and perception of the region. There has to be a Blue print of 360 degree solution for stakeholders along with an integrated approach to achieve those goals. The corridors of power have to show intent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bcci/articleshow/81862970.cms||---

---||Goa||Speaker to hear disqualification pleas on Monday||PANAJI: Speaker of the Goa legislative assembly Rajesh Patnekar is likely to hear the petitions by Congress and MGP seeking disqualification of 12 MLAs on Monday, while the Supreme Court has the case listed for hearing on Tuesday. Congress had filed a petition before the SC seeking direction to expedite the disqualification plea against 10 of its former legislators, including deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar. It had approached the Supreme Court citing the delay by the speaker in deciding the matter. The Supreme Court had consequently directed Patnekar to decide on the petitions by February 26. State Congress president Girish Chodankar, in his plea, had cited an order in the Manipur assembly case passed by the Supreme Court in March and had sought a direction to restrain the MLAs from attending assembly proceedings during the pendency of the disqualification petitions. The pleas have been pending for a year and a half, and Patnekar had adjourned hearings by citing the Covid-19 pandemic and the writ petition filed by Chodankar. In August 2019, Congress had filed a disqualification petition before the speaker against the 10 rebel MLAs who quit and joined BJP in July that year. Chodankar, who had filed the plea, had sought that the 10 MLAs be restrained from attending assembly proceedings and holding constitutional posts till the case was decided by the speaker. MGP had also filed a disqualification petition against deputy chief minister Manohar Ajgaonkar and PWD minister Deepak Pauskar who had quit the party to join BJP in March 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/speaker-to-hear-disqualification-pleas-on-monday/articleshow/81863121.cms||---

Both Naik and Vaz belong to the Joaquim-Yuri Alemao camp. They defeated Vishal Dessai and Rupa Gaonkar, respectively, who are affiliated to the BJP, 9-5. Alemao had announced the candidatures of Naik and Vaz for the posts of chairperson and vice chairperson the very day the results of the civic elections were declared on March 22. Naik, from the field of education and principal of an educational institution, said he wanted to clean the municipality of corruption, improve its functioning and give timely and effective service to the people. Speaking to reporters after he was elected chairperson, Naik thanked Joaquim and Yuri Alemao, whom he termed as his “mentors”, for supporting him. The panel supported by the Alemaos had won nine out of the fourteen seats in the Cuncolim municipal council while one seat was won by an independent. The loss of the BJP panel to the Alemao-backed candidates in the civic polls had jolted the saffron party, as the polls had turned out to be a matter of prestige for BJP what with chief minister Pramod Sawant himself descending on Cuncolim in the run-up to the election, obviously to drum up support for his brother-in-law, Videsh Naik Dessai. Dessai’s victory, however, turned out to be face-saver for BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/yuris-candidate-is-chairperson/articleshow/81863167.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh State Electricity Regulatory Commission rejects uniform power tariff proposal||Visakhapatnam: The Andhra Pradesh State Electricity Regulatory Commission (APSERC) has rejected ‘smart power tariff’— a uniform electricity tariff method proposed by the Visakhapatnam-based Eastern Power Distribution Company Limited (APEPDCL). APSERC chairman Justice CV Nagarjuna Reddy announced the rejection of this proposal on the occasion of releasing the new electricity tariff for the 2021–22 fiscal. Designed by APEPDCL, the ‘smart power tariff’ scheme was meant to bring all 8,511 apartments and its electricity services (1,73,668 in number) under a single umbrella by fixing the uniform and single electricity charge at Rs 5.95 per unit instead of categorising tariff in terms of units consumed. When TOI enquired why the commission rejected the ‘smart’ proposal, APEPDCL sources said that the proposed uniform rate of Rs 5.95 per unit is higher than the average electricity charge the discom currently collects from apartment dwellers, which is Rs 4.4 per unit. For example, as per the existing tariff, a person pays Rs 8,170 for 1,000 units of electricity. Under the proposed smart power tariff scheme, the same person would pay Rs 5,950, thus saving Rs 2,220. However, if a person consumes 100 units of electricity, they currently pay Rs 260 as tariff; if the smart power tariff system were to be implemented, this consumer would have had to pay Rs 595. “So, there is a difference of Rs 1.55 per unit. This may give a wrong signal to people that the government has increased power tariff for apartment residents, nearly 80–90 per cent of which are middle and upper-middle class,” a senior discom official said. A similar tariff (to the smart power tariff) is currently being provided on a pilot basis to some gated communities, said another discom official, while adding that the 35-storey Oxygen Towers at Seethammadhara is one of the consumers. Kasireddy Nanaji, treasurer of Venkateswara Towers, said, “The discom’s proposal is good, but it should have had multiple options.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/electricity-commission-rejects-uniform-power-tariff-proposal/articleshow/81856900.cms||V Kamalakara Rao

Advocate general S Sriram, arguing on behalf of the state government, said as there is no mention of who committed the crime in the affidavit, nor a complaint filed, a CBI probe cannot be ordered in this case. He further said that there’s no bona fide intention behind the petition, and it’s only intended to malign the state government. When the petitioner was working as SEC, the affidavits he filed before the court used to appear in newspapers even before the hearing was taken up, Sriram said, adding that as there is no proper ground to seek a CBI inquiry, the petition is liable to be dismissed. Arguing on behalf of Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy, advocate V R N Prashanth said the documents annexed with the petition were tampered. He said there is no law to restrict the letters written by the petitioners to become public. Immunity is given subject to some specific conditions when public interest is involved. A CBI inquiry cannot be sought on the ground that the former SEC received notices from the assembly privilege committee, Prashanth argued. The high court asked whether the privilege notices were given based on the leaked letters or was it was based on some other material also. Prashanth told the court that he would file an affidavit with the details, following which the court posted the matter for further hearing to Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/nimmagadda-filed-petition-only-to-malign-govt-sriram/articleshow/81857000.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Arguing on behalf of the company, senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi told the high court that keeping the raw material idle for longer periods is dangerous and they have to be processed according to the timelines. He sought the high court’s permission to sell raw material and packaging material. Details of sales proceeds and to whom the product is sold will be filed before the high court in the form of an affidavit, he said. Arguing on behalf of the state government, special government pleader C Sumon said that they did not have any objection if the company sold the products in the plant. However, the sales proceeds should be deposited in a fixed deposit account to pay compensation to the victims. As dangerous materials were present in the LG Polymers plant, the sales proceedings should be done under the supervision of a competent authority, said Sumon adding that safety guidelines have to be framed before undertaking the sales proceedings. The high court bench comprising Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice C Praveen Kumar asked who should be appointed as competent authority to oversee the sale proceedings. Sumon said that the government will file a detailed affidavit regarding the same and sought time.

Initially, the food park will focus on setting up a cashew processing unit at Rampachodavaram in East Godavari district and a coffee curing centre at Narsipatnam in Visakhapatnam. Girijan Cooperative Corporation (GCC), the nodal body, has submitted proposals for the food park and identified land. The central government-funded project, which will be implemented through Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA), is intended to boost tribal income and help generate employment in agency areas. Speaking to TOI, GCC general manager (marketing) D Surendra Kumar said that around five acres land will be needed for the food park and the project would cost Rs 5–10 crore. “The food park project, which will generate employment for hundreds of tribal people, is likely to be completed by 2022,” Kumar said. Apart from the food park, 263 Van Dhan Vikas Kendras (forest wealth development centres) are being set up in eight districts in the state. Explaining the purpose of these centres, Kumar said, “The scheme, Van Dhan Yojana, is a market-linked tribal entrepreneurship programme for forming clusters of tribal self-help groups and strengthening them into tribal producer companies.” “The scheme for minimum support price (MSP) for minor forest produce (MFP) and development of value chain was started by the ministry of tribal affairs some years ago to provide fair price to MFP gatherers, enhance their income and ensure sustainable harvesting of MFPs,” the GCC general manager (marketing) said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/with-cashew-coffee-tribal-food-park-to-come-up-in-ap/articleshow/81857219.cms||Sulogna Mehta

---||India||Covid virus may be getting more infectious, less lethal||An analysis of Covid-19 cases and deaths in the ongoing second wave in India suggests that the virus maybe getting more infectious but less lethal – a course that many experts and epidemiologists had earlier anticipated. The analysis by TOI compared the ongoing wave with the earlier phase of outbreak in 23 large states and UTs that are witnessing a steady increase in cases. Based on the growth rate of cases, the pandemic can be divided into two broad phases — the early phase that started in January last year, peaked around September and was cooling off until mid-February this year and the latest phase that started after February in most states (except Maharashtra and Punjab) where infections are again rising. Of course, the rise may also be due to reduced curbs and increased laxity. Still, data suggest that in five states/UTs — Maharashtra, Punjab, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Chandigarh — the second wave seems to be in full flow with average daily fresh cases surpassing those in the earlier phase. Fatality rate indicates virus has mutated to be more infective, less lethal: ExpertIn Maharashtra, the first wave started on March 9, 2020 and ended on December 22, 2020, when daily average of cases reached its minimum value. In this 288-day period, 19 lakh cases were reported, averaging 6,606 a day. Since December 22, the state is witnessing another surge in cases and the 99 days since then till March 31, 2021 have seen 9.1 lakh cases, an average of 9,197 cases a day. Similarly, the daily average of cases in Punjab is 1,069 for this phase compared to 532 earlier. For Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Chandigarh, this average is 888, 828, and 128 respectively for this phase. In the same order, these states and UTs averaged 805, 780 and 64 in the earlier phase. Read AlsoMaharashtra reports record 43,183 new Covid cases; Mumbai sees highest daily spikeNEW DELHI: Maharashtra on Thursday reported as many as 43,183 new Covid-19 cases, its highest single-day rise in infection tally since the pandemic began. With this, the state's cumulative caseload mounted to 28,56,163. The state also recorded 249 Covid deaths taking the toll in Maharashtra toApart from the increase in daily cases, another indicator consistent among all these states and UTs in the ongoing phase of the pandemic is a dramatic drop in the case fatality rate — deaths per 100 infections. The CFR has dropped by 75% for Maharshtra, 41% for Punjab, 83% for Gujarat, 72% for Madhya Pradesh and 65% for Chandigarh. “The virus seems to have mutated to be more infective and less lethal as the overall case fatality rate at all-India level is about one-third of its previous value,” said Dr Sumit Ray, head of critical care medicine in Delhi’s Holy Family Hospital. He explained that viruses typically mutate to increase their spread and survival and this has earlier happened to many viruses like the influenza virus. “Viruses go out there to increase the survival of their species, and we are collateral damage,” he said. He also added that the low fatality in the ongoing phase might also be because the virus is infecting more young patients (possibly because a fair number of elderly are vaccinated and also because the young are more mobile and hence more exposed). Further, a better understanding of the pathophysiology now than at the onset of Covid-19 means patients are being treated more appropriately. He cautioned that deaths lag by about 10 days from the surge in cases. “Still, the patterns so far show a significant decline,” he said. The data shows that among 21 of these 23 states and UTs, cases have been steadily increasing for at least 30 days, Bihar and Odisha being the only exceptions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-virus-may-be-getting-more-infectious-less-lethal/articleshow/81865888.cms||Atul Thakur

Seeking re-election from the coveted segment represented by former chief minister M Karunanidhi twice, Subramanian tells Julie Mariappan that people want him again.Q: What have you done for Saidapet voters to re-elect you?I have spent the local area development fund to build three community halls, four anganwadis, six ration shops, three gyms, additional classrooms and infrastructure for schools, upgraded a government hospital and three roadside parks. There is a huge popularity for schemes delivered without the support of the government, especially Pasumai Saidai launched by DMK chief M K Stalin in July 2017. Locals call via two toll free lines on important occasions like birthdays and get saplings and tree guards free of cost with their names on stickers. The plantation drive has seen 90,000 saplings of ‘pungan’ (Indian beech), ‘poovarasan’ (Indian tulip) and ‘naval’ (black plum) being raised in the constituency. Desilting of temple tanks, building of rain water harvesting structures, computer education and medical camps with the support of major private hospitals are the notable contributions. At least 99% of my electorate knows my number and reaches out to me. They would like to re-elect me since I fulfil their expectations.Q: The constituency was represented by former chief minister M Karunanidhi twice. Yet the amenities here are poor.The bridges and flyovers you see in Saidapet were built by the DMK. The Aranganathan subway was made in 1974-75 by former CM M Karunanidhi, Sardar Patel Road flyover and Bazaar Road subway by my party chief when he was mayor. Aadu Thotti flyover and Jones Road subway opened when I was mayor. Drainage facilities were built in several areas including Jothima Nagar, Neruppu Medu and Chetti Thottam. Ekkaduthangal got its main water pipeline in 1989. The DMK provided all infrastructure.Q: What are your plans to resolve drinking water shortage?I brought drinking water from neighbouring districts to meet the local requirements for a month when the crisis was severe. Our manifesto promises water through pipelines and no tankers. Saidapet will benefit when water sources get augmented by the DMK government. The DMK even took to the streets to resolve the water crisis and constituents would remember that. Q: Inundation remains a problem during rain. What happened to the strengthening of the Adyar river bund?The DMK held massive protests twice seeking a flood protection wall and raised it several times in the assembly and made representations with government officials. They started the work in certain areas, and we exposed the irregularities in construction. Work is on at a snail’s pace. We will resolve everything when the party returns to power.Q: What are your poll promises this time?Pasumai Saidai and Karunanidhi computer centre will continue services. Job camps will be held given that 6,000 people have benefited in the past five years, apart from skill development training for women. In-situ housing for Thideer Nagar slum dwellers and pattas for unobjectionable areas will be delivered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/people-will-re-elect-me-since-i-fulfil-their-expectations/articleshow/81865938.cms||---

A desperate BJP is peddling lies and misinformation. We demand that the PM withdraws his statement and apologises,” said Trinamool MP Sukhendu Sekhar Ray. “BJP’s claim of winning around 80% of the 60 seats that went to polls on Phase 1 and 2 is laughable. Even if they win 25%-30% of the seats (in both phases) they should consider themselves lucky.” Trinamool MP Derek O Brien dubbed the PM’s statement a “cheap shot”. “If they are so in love with Bengal, why doesn’t the PM or home minister file a nomination from here? There is still time for the last date for the last phase of polls,” he said. Ray, who along with other party seniors, has been camping in Nandigram, said, “BJP has played all its tricks. The central forces and police had hounded our party leadership, forcing them out of their homes. This is despite court orders. Even on Thursday, party poll agents were not allowed in a few booths. Despite this, the CM will win with a huge majority and her opponents will have no face to hide. A lot of women have voted for her.” Trinamool’s Mahua Maitra tweeted: “Contesting from second seat? Yes Mr PM, she will. And it will be Varanasi! So, go get your armour on.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/bjps-victory-claims-laughable-tmc/articleshow/81865939.cms||---
