Firing started at 4:35am,” he said. “The militants refused to surrender and instead took five civilians in hostage. That’s why the operation got delayed,” Kumar said, adding “we managed to take the hostages out and then the encounter started in which three terrorists were killed.” The slain terrorists have been identified as Suhail Nisar Lone and Yasir Wani, both residents of Khrew area of Pulwama, and Junaid Ahmad from Prichoo in the same district. “All the three had joined (militants ranks) this year — two in February and one in March,” the IGP said. Kumar said Suhail and Junaid were involved in the attack on Khan’s residence in which a policeman was killed and his riffle was snatched. “Suhail is the one who was wearing a burqa. Both were affiliated with the Al-Badr outfit. We recovered one Ak-47 riffle, one pistol and the SLR riffle that was snatched in the Nowgam attack,” the IGP said, adding that two more Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists based in Srinagar, Obaid and Shahid, are still on the run. Preliminary investigations have revealed that Lashkar and Al-Badr had jointly carried out the Nowgam attack. The IGP said a vehicle (Alto) used by militants in the attack has also been seized. “The vehicle was found outside the house where the encounter took place (on Friday). It belongs to the house owner. We will arrest him under UAPA [Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act],” he said. A woman suffered a bullet wound in her leg during cross-firing near the encounter site, while three civilians suffered pellet injuries. “All are stable,” Kumar said. Asked how many militants were active in Srinagar, the IGP said there were six of them including the two who are wanted in the Nowgam attack case. “We are working on leads and very soon they will either be arrested, killed or brought back,” Kumar said, adding “we will not allow the situation in Srinagar to turn bad”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/2-terrorists-behind-death-of-cop-killed/articleshow/81877943.cms||M Saleem Pandit

---||Goa||A year later, 22 players summoned for match-fixing inquiry in Goa||PANAJI: The Goa Football Association’s ethics committee will begin its inquiry into match-fixing with an estimated 22 players from six clubs being asked to depose in Mapusa on Saturday. Sportradar, a London-based betting watch dog, red flagged six matches in the Goa Professional League (GPL) last year for “suspicious betting patterns indicative of match manipulation”. For a year, the GFA did nothing, apart from a shambolic “investigation” which pointed an accusing finger at its own partner. The report was rejected by the All India Football Federation’s integrity officer, Javed Siraj. Now, GFA has sent notices to several clubs asking their players and coaches to “personally remain present before the GFA ethics committee on Saturday (April 3) for an inquiry relating their participation in a match played by them on behalf of the club in the Goa Professional League 2019-20.” Six of the 22 players are understood to be from Guardian Angel Sports Club, linked with three red-flagged-matches. However, club president Jhoncy Fernandes said only four players are still at the club. It’s the same at Calangute Association. While five players have been asked to depose before the committee, only one continues to be on their rolls. At FC Goa, both players summoned finished their contracts on May 31, 2020. “We are not aware of their whereabouts. It is unfortunate that the GFA has delayed in starting this inquiry as many players have left us,” said FC Goa general secretary Jonathan de Sousa. Salgaocar FC wondered why their players have been summoned for the inquiry when the red-flagged match – identified by GFA in its letter – saw the club win comfortably. “Our team won with a huge margin of 4-0. I fail to understand how could our team members influence the result/outcome of a winning match,” Salgaocar general secretary Adlear D’Cruz wrote in an email to GFA general secretary Jovito Lopes. “Let us know on what grounds our team members are called for the inquiry and as to how the new season commenced without resolving the inquiries raised in the previous season.” Sporting Clube have questioned the timing of the inquiry and are unlikely to allow their lone player to depose before the ethics committee on Saturday, particularly since they have an important game to play later in the day. “Our player will be available on any other day other than 07.04.2021 and 10.04.2021, which are the days when Sporting Clube are scheduled to play round 10 and round 11 matches. “A further delay till the last league match scheduled on 15.04.2021 would make no harm as the inquiry is pertaining to the Goa Professional League 2019-20,” CEO Welvin Menezes told the GFA on Thursday. GFA secretary Jovito Lopes did not respond to calls and messages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/a-year-later-22-players-summoned-for-match-fixing-inquiry-in-goa/articleshow/81878029.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Goa||No fans for AFC Cup playoffs too||PANAJI: The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has suggested to Bengaluru FC that it would be better to play their playoffs behind closed doors at the GMC Athletic Stadium in Bambolim. The preliminary stage 2 clash will be played between Bengaluru and the winners of Tribhuvan Army FC (Nepal) and SL Police SC (Sri Lanka) on April 14. Should Bengaluru cross that hurdle, they are drawn to play the winner of the second preliminary stage 2 match between Abahani Dhaka (Bangladesh) and the winner of Club Eagles (Maldives) and Thimphu City FC (Bhutan) on April 21. The games will now be played without spectators. “AFC’s strong recommendation is to play the game behind closed doors and that seems to be the most logical thing to do at the moment,” a senior official told TOI on Friday. “The club is free to allow fans but must present a detailed plan about the flow of spectators to AFC. It’s not easy with Covid-19 cases rising in Goa. We all understand that fans want to see games live at the stadium, but these are difficult times.” Unlike the rest of India, Goa has opened its doors to everyone. Anyone is free to enter the state, without a customary Covid-19 test or a Covid-19 negative certificate. The last couple of days has seen cases rising steadily with Friday’s 280 positive cases taking the active tally to 1913. The All India Football Federation (AIFF) had previously decided not to allow fans for FC Goa’s AFC Champions League group games at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda. “Bengaluru have created their own bio-secure bubble and are in touch with AFC to ensure that the visiting team arrives here at least four days prior to the clash so that necessary precautions can be taken,” said another source. Bengaluru quarantined themselves for seven days in Goa before starting training at the Dempo academy ground in Old Goa. Coach Marco Pezzaiuoli must decide which foreign player to leave out for the AFC Cup campaign. Spanish defender Juanan, who picked up an injury during the Indian Super League, has recovered and completed full training early this week. The other foreign players are Erik Paartalu, Cleiton Silva, Dimas Delgado and Yrondu Musavu-King.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-fans-for-afc-cup-playoffs-too/articleshow/81878042.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Of the over 7 crore registrations till 9pm on Friday, just 1 crore were done online, whereas 3.75 crore people walked in to receive the jabs, official data reviewed by TOI showed. The total also includes about 2.3 crore health and frontline workers whose details were pre-populated on the Co-Win software. Over 22 lakh registrations were recorded on Friday till 9pm. The numbers under review relate almost completely to the third phase onwards when vaccination was opened to 60-plus citizens as well as those above 45 with co-morbidities. Phase I and II involved health and frontline workers and their details were supplied by states. A relatively small number of these recipients walked in to receive their shots. States and hospitals were allowed walk-in registration almost from the start of the 60-plus vaccination stage and continued with the age bracket expanded to 45-plus. India administered over 7 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccines till 9pm on Friday. This included 4.3 crore people above 45 years of age. While around 6.1 crore people have been covered so far with the first dose, 92.6 lakh have been fully vaccinated. Experts stressed on the urgent need to ramp up vaccination, particularly in the wake of rising number of Covid-19 cases across the country. Coronavirus live updatesA study by Tata Consultancy Services said that with no vaccination, the second wave would likely peak at 70,000 cases and the tail end would likely start in 140 days. On the other hand, with vaccination rate of 80,000 per day, the peak would be 20,000 cases and the tail end would likely start after 60 days. "Rapid vaccination will not only reduce peak cases but will significantly arrest the growth of disease. Taking the simulated results into account, we believe that increase in the vaccination rate will help in arresting the second wave of Covid-19 in India as well as reduce the impact of the third wave," the study said.

While both online and onsite registrations are allowed for vaccination, online registrations enable the government as well as hospitals to better manage sessions, an official said. "Online registrations not only help manage the crowd, data and stock availability but also help eliminate any pilferage or corruption. However, we understand that many people may not be able to do online registration so the option of walk-in is there," the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/walk-ins-for-shots-four-times-the-no-of-online-registrations/articleshow/81878622.cms||Sushmi Dey

Friday recorded the highest single-day tally since December 4 last year, when the city had recorded 4,067 cases in a day. With this, the number of active cases has gone up to 11,994 from 10,498 a day before. Though experts have described the situation as grim, the chief minister, following a review, said the fourth wave was less serious than the previous ones, the mortality rates were comparatively low and the number of people being admitted in hospitals and ICU was relatively low as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/new-cases-in-delhi-touch-4-month-high-positivity-rate-4-1-cm-rules-out-lockdown/articleshow/81879188.cms||---
---||World||Man rams car into 2 Capitol police; 1 officer, driver killed||WASHINGTON: A Capitol Police officer was killed Friday after a man rammed a car into two officers at a barricade outside the US Capitol and then emerged wielding a knife. It was the second line-of-duty death this year for a department still struggling to heal from the Jan. 6 insurrection. US President Biden said he was 'heartbroken' over the deadly attack at US Capitol. "Jill and I were heartbroken to learn of the violent attack at a security checkpoint on the US Capitol grounds, which killed Officer William Evans of the US Capitol Police, and left a fellow officer fighting for his life," he said in a statement. "We send our heartfelt condolences to Officer Evans' family, and everyone grieving his loss." Video shows the driver of the crashed car emerging with a knife in his hand and starting to run at the pair of officers, Capitol Police Acting Chief Yogananda Pittman told reporters. Authorities shot the suspect, who died at a hospital. Two law enforcement officials told The Associated Press that the suspect stabbed one of the officers. The officials spoke to AP were not authorized to publicly discuss the pending investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity. ``I just ask that the public continue to keep US Capitol Police and their families in your prayers,`` Pittman said. ``This has been an extremely difficult time for US Capitol Police after the events of Jan. 6 and now the events that have occurred here today.'' Police identified the slain officer as William ``Billy'' Evans, an 18-year veteran who was a member of the department's first responders unit. Authorities said that there wasn't an ongoing threat and that the attack did not appear to be related to terrorism, though the Capitol was put on lockdown as a precaution. There was also no immediate connection apparent between Friday's crash and the Jan. 6 riot. The crash and shooting happened at a security checkpoint near the Capitol typically used by senators and staff on weekdays, though most are away from the building during the current recess. The attack occurred about 100 yards (91 meters) from the entrance of the building on the Senate side of the Capitol. One witness, the Rev. Patrick Mahoney, said he was finishing a Good Friday service nearby when he suddenly heard three shots ring out. It comes as the Washington region remains on edge nearly three months after a mob of armed insurrectionists loyal to former President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol as Congress was voting to certify Joe Biden's presidential win. Five people died in the Jan. 6 riot, including Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who was among a badly outnumbered force trying to fight off insurrectionists seeking to overturn the election. Authorities installed a tall perimeter fence around the Capitol and for months restricted traffic along the roads closest to the building, but they had begun pulling back some of the emergency measures in recent weeks. Fencing that prevented vehicular traffic near that area was recently removed. Law enforcement officials identified the slain suspect as 25-year-old Noah Green. Investigators were digging into the suspect's background and examining whether he had any mental health history as they tried to discern a motive. They were working to obtain warrants to access his online accounts. Pittman said the suspect did not appear to have been on the police's radar. But the attack underscores that the building and campus and the officers charged with protecting them remain potential targets for violence. Evans is the seventh Capitol Police member to die in the line of duty in the department's history, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page, which tracks deaths of law enforcement. Two officers, one from Capitol Police and another from Washington's Metropolitan Police Department, died by suicide following the Jan. 6 attack. Almost 140 Capitol Police officers were wounded then, including officers not issued helmets who sustained head injuries and one officer with cracked ribs, according to the officers' union. It took hours for the National Guard to arrive, a delay that has driven months of finger-pointing between key decision-makers that day. They were called upon soon afterward to secure the Capitol during Biden's inauguration and faced another potential threat in early March linked to conspiracy theories falsely claiming Trump would retake the presidency. ``Today, once again, these heroes risked their lives to protect our Capitol and our Country, with the same extraordinary selflessness and spirit of service seen on January 6,'' House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. ``On behalf of the entire House, we are profoundly grateful.'' The suspect had been taken to the hospital in critical condition. One of the officers who was injured was taken by police car to the hospital; the other was transported by emergency medical crews. The US Capitol complex was placed on lockdown after the shooting, and staffers were told they could not enter or exit buildings. Video showed National Guard troops mobilizing near the area of the crash. Video posted online showed a dark colored sedan crashed against a vehicle barrier and a police K-9 inspecting the vehicle. Law enforcement and paramedics could be seen caring for at least one unidentified individual. Biden had just departed the White House for Camp David when the attack occurred. As customary, he was traveling with a member of the National Security Council Staff who was expected to brief him on the incident.

---||India||Wazegate: 2 officers under NIA scanner||MUMBAI: Two senior city police officers, including an IPS rank officer, and a high-profile retired cop are under the scanner of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) probing the planting of explosives in a Scorpio near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25 and the subsequent murder of the Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran on March 4. It is also learnt that Waze handed over Mansukh to the killers in Thane and created an alibi that he was in Dongri for official work. TOI has learnt that NIA investigations indicate that initial plans hatched in November 2020 were to plant explosives in a stolen vehicle, identify two members of an outlawed organisation and kill them in a fake encounter near Ambani’s residence. Sources said that the Maruti Eeco was stolen from Aurangabad with this plan in mind. The car belonged to Vijay Nade, a clerk with the social justice department in Jalna, who had lodged a complaint of theft with the City Chowk police station there. The vehicle is not yet traced, but the number plate was recovered from Mithi River along with Waze’s CPU, laptop, hard drives and DVRs on Sunday. The NIA, with the help of anti-terrorism squad, is looking for the Maruti Eeco. Nade is not part of the conspiracy, officials said. However, Waze’s plan went awry as he got stuck with the Television Rating Point manipulation scam probe and in the modified scheme of things, it was decided to plant gelatin sticks only. The motive is still not clear. Investigations have pointed out that the two senior police officers and the retired cop were reportedly aware of the plan. One has already been questioned and another is under the scanner for holding meetings with Waze and the high-profile retired cop. The NIA is focusing on the March 2 and 3 meetings at the police headquarters. Sources said that the March 2 meeting, which went on for three hours, was attended by the IPS officer, the retired cop and Waze. On March 3, a meeting was held at the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) office attended by Waze, arrested constable Vinayak Shinde, and a police inspector of another crime branch unit. A hotelier who had come to hand over a hafta collection of Rs 1.7 crore to Waze claimed that he overheard policemen trying to convince Mansukh to take responsibility. Waze had asked Mansukh to take responsibility for the explosives-laden car and had promised to bail him out immediately. The hotelier, who has now become a witness to the meeting, told NIA officials that he overheard Mansukh coming in and out of Waze’s cabin and mumbling to himself as to why he should take the responsibility when he had not done anything wrong. On March 4, around 6.30pm, Waze left CIU office leaving his mobile phone behind. He was captured on the CCTV camera waiting for the train at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. “He reached Thane around 8.10pm and called Mansukh at 8.20pm from a SIM card procured through an accomplice from Gujarat. He asked Mansukh to meet him at Ghodbunder Road, but told him to tell his wife that he was going to meet an inspector Tawde as Mansukh’s family was upset with Waze. Waze picked him up in his Audi car in which there were already three people, including Shinde,” said a source. Waze is believed to have handed over Mansukh to his killers and at 9.20pm, took a train to Byculla. He proceeded to Dongri and asked his subordinate Riyazuddin Kazi to get his phone from his office, sources said. And then at 10.30 pm, Waze went to Dongri police station and informed that he was carrying out searches in some hotels. “This was an alibi to hoodwink the investigators,” an official said. Officials suspect that Mansukh was smothered to death in a running car and his body was dumped in a Mumbra creek. Police said that Waze later went to his office at the police headquarters. Mansukh’s body was found on March 5. The senior police officer under scanner had reportedly left instructions with Thane police to extend logistics support to the conspirators who participated in the killing. Meanwhile, the NIA continued questioning a woman who was seen with Waze in a five-star hotel and travelled with him in the Audi. NIA declined to comment on her role.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/wazegate-2-officers-under-nia-scanner/articleshow/81880149.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||---||EC suspends 4 poll workers for ferrying EVMs in BJP neta’s car||NEW DELHI/ GUWAHATI: Amid a political outcry and trading of charges, the Election Commission on Friday ordered suspension of four polling personnel in Ratabari (SC) assembly constituency in Assam after they violated EVM transport protocol by hitching a ride with machines following Thursday’s polling in a private car belonging to the wife of a BJP candidate from another constituency. The EC said the personnel — presiding officer Sahab Uddin Talukdar and three others — only later found out whom the car belonged to, but they were acted against for violating rules intended to protect the sanctity of EVMs. The polled EVMs were found intact, but the EC directed that a repoll at the polling booth concerned in Ratabari (SC) be done “as added precaution”. Based on a report received from the special observer recommending action against the armed escort officer for leaving behind the stranded polling party and not ensuring their safe arrival at the destination, the EC also ordered the suspension of armed escort officer Luhit Gohai and sub-inspector of police (armed branch) of 3rd Assam Police Battalion, Titabor. The special observer, however, said there seemed to be no ground for change of the Ratabari (SC) returning officer since the incident appeared to be an isolated one, caused by “total negligence and foolishness of the presiding officer and his team”. The report also ruled out any deliberate or mala fide intention in the incident, aimed to disrupt the polling process. The presiding officer has been issued a show cause notice for violation of the transport protocol. Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra slammed the EC and questioned the “coincidence” of the stranded polling party finding a vehicle of the BJP candidate to hitch a ride. The EC said the polling party, after completion of elections on Thursday, was returning in a convoy escorted by an armed escort led by police officer Luhit Gohain. The vehicle broke down around 9 pm as it approached Nilam Bazaar. Due to the traffic congestion and inclement weather, the polling party became detached from the convoy. The party alighted from the vehicle and informed sector officer Ajoy Sutradhar by telephone. While the sector officer was arranging another vehicle, the polling party decided to organise a vehicle on its own so as to reach the material receipt centre faster. At about 9.20 pm, the polling party hailed a passing vehicle and boarded it along with the EVM and other material, without checking the ownership of the vehicle. As reported by the polling party, they moved towards Karimganj and as they reached Kanaishil at about 10 pm, they had to slow down in the traffic. At this point, they were surrounded by a mob of about 50 people which started pelting stones at them and did not allow the vehicle to pass. When they inquired, a person replied that it was the vehicle of Krishnendu Paul, a candidate in the neighbouring constituency (Patharkandi LAC-2) and alleged that the EVM was being taken to be tampered with. The EC said it was only then that the polling party realised that something was amiss and alerted the sector officer. However, a larger crowd gathered by then and the polling party was attacked and held hostage along with the EVM. Meanwhile, the antecedents of the vehicle were ascertained and it was found to be registered in the name of Madhumita Paul, wife of the BJP candidate in Patharkandi. The mob, the EC said, had turned violent and damaged the car windshield with stones. During the course of the stone pelting, SP Karimganj sustained minor injuries on his collarbone and blank firing had to be done to disperse the mob. The first polling officer was found missing in the commotion. The polled EVMs, along with rest of the polling party, were safely escorted from the area and taken into the control of district election officers at 10.20 pm. “On examination, the polled EVM comprising of BU, CU and VVPAT was found to be with its seal intact without any damage whatsoever. All the items have been deposited in the strong room,” the EC said. The first polling officer was missing until the wee hours of Friday as he was hiding in the undergrowth nearby.

---||India||EC suspends 4 poll workers for ferrying EVMs in BJP neta’s car||NEW DELHI/ GUWAHATI: Amid a political outcry and trading of charges, the Election Commission on Friday ordered suspension of four polling personnel in Ratabari (SC) assembly constituency in Assam after they violated EVM transport protocol by hitching a ride with machines following Thursday’s polling in a private car belonging to the wife of a BJP candidate from another constituency. The EC said the personnel — presiding officer Sahab Uddin Talukdar and three others — only later found out whom the car belonged to, but they were acted against for violating rules intended to protect the sanctity of EVMs. The polled EVMs were found intact, but the EC directed that a repoll at the polling booth concerned in Ratabari (SC) be done “as added precaution”. Based on a report received from the special observer recommending action against the armed escort officer for leaving behind the stranded polling party and not ensuring their safe arrival at the destination, the EC also ordered the suspension of armed escort officer Luhit Gohai and sub-inspector of police (armed branch) of 3rd Assam Police Battalion, Titabor. The special observer, however, said there seemed to be no ground for change of the Ratabari (SC) returning officer since the incident appeared to be an isolated one, caused by “total negligence and foolishness of the presiding officer and his team”. The report also ruled out any deliberate or mala fide intention in the incident, aimed to disrupt the polling process. The presiding officer has been issued a show cause notice for violation of the transport protocol. Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra slammed the EC and questioned the “coincidence” of the stranded polling party finding a vehicle of the BJP candidate to hitch a ride. The EC said the polling party, after completion of elections on Thursday, was returning in a convoy escorted by an armed escort led by police officer Luhit Gohain. The vehicle broke down around 9 pm as it approached Nilam Bazaar. Due to the traffic congestion and inclement weather, the polling party became detached from the convoy. The party alighted from the vehicle and informed sector officer Ajoy Sutradhar by telephone. While the sector officer was arranging another vehicle, the polling party decided to organise a vehicle on its own so as to reach the material receipt centre faster. At about 9.20 pm, the polling party hailed a passing vehicle and boarded it along with the EVM and other material, without checking the ownership of the vehicle. As reported by the polling party, they moved towards Karimganj and as they reached Kanaishil at about 10 pm, they had to slow down in the traffic. At this point, they were surrounded by a mob of about 50 people which started pelting stones at them and did not allow the vehicle to pass. When they inquired, a person replied that it was the vehicle of Krishnendu Paul, a candidate in the neighbouring constituency (Patharkandi LAC-2) and alleged that the EVM was being taken to be tampered with. The EC said it was only then that the polling party realised that something was amiss and alerted the sector officer. However, a larger crowd gathered by then and the polling party was attacked and held hostage along with the EVM. Meanwhile, the antecedents of the vehicle were ascertained and it was found to be registered in the name of Madhumita Paul, wife of the BJP candidate in Patharkandi. The mob, the EC said, had turned violent and damaged the car windshield with stones. During the course of the stone pelting, SP Karimganj sustained minor injuries on his collarbone and blank firing had to be done to disperse the mob. The first polling officer was found missing in the commotion. The polled EVMs, along with rest of the polling party, were safely escorted from the area and taken into the control of district election officers at 10.20 pm. “On examination, the polled EVM comprising of BU, CU and VVPAT was found to be with its seal intact without any damage whatsoever. All the items have been deposited in the strong room,” the EC said. The first polling officer was missing until the wee hours of Friday as he was hiding in the undergrowth nearby. This delayed the transmission of a report to the EC by a few hours. Priyanka Gandhi later tweeted, “Every time there is an election, videos of private vehicles caught transporting EVMs show up.

Stalin responded with a show of political valour. “I am the son of Kalaignar. I will not be scared by such raids. I have faced MISA (Maintenance of Internal Security Act) and Emergency. They can scare the AIADMK with such raids, but not the DMK,” he said. Accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of instigating the raids, Stalin said, “The people will reply to your act on April 6”. Stalin’s son Udhayanidhi dared I-T officials to raid him. “Raiding the opposition is the BJP’s coping mechanism when facing electoral defeat,” tweeted Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. “IT raids on Stalin ji’s son-in-law is yet another example of GOI hounding political opponents through their trusted agencies,” Mehbooba Mufti tweeted. Searches were carried out on premises in Teynampet and Neelangarai, owned by Stalin’s daughter Senthamarai and her husband Sabareesan. Searches were also conducted at the Anna Nagar residence of DMK IT wing functionary Karthik Mohan, son of sitting Anna Nagar MLA and DMK’s candidate in the same constituency this election, M K Mohan. I-T officials also searched the residence of G Square Bala, who faced similar action ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Searches were also carried out at premises owned by DMK MLA V Senthil Balaji in Aravakurichi and those of his associates in Karur, Coimbatore and a few other places. Officials searched Balaji’s house in Rameswarapatti village as also that of his brother Ashok at Ramakrishnapuram in Karur. They also searched the premises of DMK town secretary Darani Saravanan and his friend Mani in Karur. In a statement, the income tax department said the Chennai Directorate of Income Tax conducted searches on three different groups and a few individuals in Tamil Nadu. These groups and individuals are involved in businesses ranging from distilleries and breweries, real estate, local financing and handling cash of politically exposed persons for the ongoing elections, it said. IT officials went back disappointed, said DMK Oganization secretary R S Bharathi "The IT officials found ₹1.36 lakh cash in Senthamarai's residence, which was kept for household expenses. They gave it back to her and left. Thank you Modi for conducting this raid," Bharathi told reporters late on Friday. "In the residence of Senthil Balaji they found only ₹8,000 in cash. In the residence of DMK Anna Nagar MLA M K Mohan, they found ₹2 lakh in cash. He had drawn ₹4 lakh cash from bank and had spent ₹2 lakh as election expenditure. The officials gave back that cash and returned disappointed," Bharathi said. While DMK general secretary S Durai Murugan said the searches were being done with a “political objective”, DMK allies including TNCC president K S Alagiri, CPM state secretary K Balakrishnan and VCK chief Thol Thirumavalavan hit out at the BJP for targeting the DMK ahead of the assembly poll. DMK complained to the Election Commission of India against the IT searches just days ahead of the polls. “The IT department has been used as a sword and as a pawn in the hands of the ruling BJP party,” it said in the complaint, while charging the IT officials with abusing their powers under the garb of discharging their official duties.

The state transport departments can put such a list of persons on their portals, which people can see, according to the modified Central Motor Vehicle Rules. The road transport ministry on Wednesday notified a set of modified rules, which have come into effect from Thursday (April 1). These include a provision to allow registration of vehicles with alterations, retrofitment and adapted vehicles where such changes have been made after permission from the transport authorities concerned. Such vehicles can be insured, something which was not allowed earlier. Sources said the enabling provision to “name and shame” repeat offenders who pose risk to their lives and that of other road users has been made to promote responsible driving. However, such names can be made public, if the offender doesn’t go for an appeal within a month after disqualification to hold a DL or the appellate authority dismisses his/ her appeal. “This procedure has been made to ensure that there is no breach of privacy and the process of appeal against charges of traffic rule violations are duly followed before putting names of repeat offenders in the list,” said a government official. The transport departments will create a separate section in their portal named “Revocation of Driving License under sub-section (1A) of section 19 of the Act” which will be in a machine-readable electronic, printable and shareable pdf form, for access by the general public. The new changes in the rules will also make it convenient for people to avail transport-related services as the system will be online; starting from filing application and issuance of learner’s licence to submission of medical certificate and surrender and renewal of DL. The government has also done away with the minimum educational qualification for obtaining DL for commercial vehicles and this has been replaced with the mandatory requirement of “minimum training and language comprehension”. The modified rules also mandate that the vehicle registration will be at dealers’ point in the case of fully built vehicles. This means there will be no need to take the vehicle for registration to RTOs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/repeat-traffic-offenders-can-now-be-named-and-shamed/articleshow/81880402.cms||Dipak K Dash

The unusual letter sent to the Punjab chief secretary and DGP on March 17, said it had been informed by BSF that most of the 58 Indian nationals it had apprehended from the border areas of Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Ferozepur and Abohar in 2019-2020, were found to be either mentally challenged or in a feeble state of mind. It turned out they had been working as bonded labourers on the employ of farmers in border villages of Punjab. These people came from economically weak background and hailed from remote areas of UP and Bihar. A BSF official told TOI that the labourers were apprehended as they were possibly loitering in the border and could not come up with a plausible explanation for their presence there. Read Also63 bonded labourers rescued from 2 brick kilns of Punjab rescued after HC interventionSixty-three bonded labourers — including 13 who hailed from UP’s Muzaffarnagar — have been rescued from two brick kilns in Kapurthala and Jalandhar in Punjab after the state’s high court acted on a non-profit’s plea and intervened.The Punjab government and also farm unions leading the protest against the Centre’s agri-laws rejected the allegations, terming the MHA letter a “tactic” by the BJP-led Centre to defame Punjab. “It has been informed that human trafficking syndicates hire such labourers from their native place to work in Punjab on the promise of good salary, but they are exploited, paid poorly and meted out inhuman treatment. For making them work for long hours in fields, these labourers are often given drugs, which adversely affect their physical and mental condition,” the MHA said, adding that BSF had been handing the persons to state police for necessary action. Read AlsoFCI helps Punjab stave off crisis by lifting wheat stockIn Punjab, farmers sell their foodgrains to five state procuring agencies (SPAs) and they pay the money to farmers. Later this amount is reimbursed by FCI. To pay the amount to farmers immediately, these state agencies take advance loan from an SBI-led consortium of banks.Punjab labour minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said, “These activities are being done by the Centre just to torpedo farmers’ agitation. They want to spoil Punjab’s relations with Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.” Read AlsoFarmers’ protest: SC-appointed panel on farm laws submits reportAbout two months after it was constituted and after holding 12 rounds of consultations with the stakeholders, the committee appointed by the Supreme Court to study the three contentious central farm laws submitted its report on March 19. According to one of the three members on the panel, the reportSukhjinder Singh Randhawa, cooperative and jails minister, said the Centre’s allegations were an insult to the border farmers who had bravely fought against Pakistan. The Centre should immediately revoke its letter and tender an unconditional apology, he said. Even Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, spearheading the farmers’ stir, claimed it was an attempt by the Centre to weaken their protest and drive a wedge between farmers and labourers. The MHA requested the Punjab chief secretary and DGP to take measures to address the “serious” issue, citing the multi-dimensional problem which involves human trafficking, bonded labour and human rights violations. A copy of the letter was also forwarded to the Union labour secretary Apurva Chandra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-unusual-move-mha-flags-punjab-on-bonded-labourers/articleshow/81880409.cms||---

The release of the grant in the accounts of the 362 applicants, however, is not yet done. During the probe, it came to fore that many beneficiaries, who were shown as single were married women, besides in some other cases, parents received grants despite not having a daughter in the family.

In the last few years, there have been several instances of fraud with regard to procurement of marriage grants. “Recently, an FIR against five such persons were lodged at the various police stations. Also, strict action against four ‘lekhpals’ in the form of their suspension was taken,” informed a senior district official. “Earlier, there used to be an odd case of ineligible women seeking to marry at government expenses but this time the number was very high,” said social welfare department officer Amarjeet Singh. He added, “This time there were nearly 550 such applicants. During screening, nearly 362 applicants were found to be ineligible for the scheme. Therefore, on the orders of the district magistrate, we are in the process of lodging a complaint in this regard at Nawabganj police station of the city.

---||Kolkata||Clashes break out in pockets a day after Phase-II polls||Kolkata: An attack on a BJP candidate during his campaign in South 24 Parganas, a violent clash between Trinamool and BJP workers in North 24 Parganas and clashes at multiple places in West Midnapore dotted the day after the second phase of polls. At Diamond Harbour, BJP candidate Dipak Halder was injured and his car was damaged by a group of men during his campaign at Haridebpur village on Friday morning. Halder, a sitting MLA who switched to BJP a few months ago, was allegedly roughed up by locals and was taken to hospital with chest pain. His supporters were reportedly attacked with sticks and poles. “It’s a planned attack by Trinamool. The incident showed the real face of the party,” he told TOI from his bed at Diamond Harbour Medical College.  BJP supporters blocked the road and burnt tyres, but cops removed them to make way for an Abhishek Banerjee rally. BJP later lodged a complaint with the EC office. Trinamool claimed the attack on the BJP candidate was a result of infighting as BJP’s old-timers were unhappy with Halder’s candidature and claimed that Halder was faking the injury. “He is a good actor. We have no involvement in the incident,” said Arumoy Gayen, a local Trinamool leader. At least 12 people, including a former councillor and CIC member, were injured after a clash broke out between Trinamool and BJP supporters in Barasat’s Maldweep area over putting up party posters on Thursday night. While Trinamool alleged a group of BJP supporters had replaced the posters of Trinamool candidate Chiranjit Chakraborty with the BJP candidate’s, BJP claimed Trinamool men had masterminded the attack and left five of them hospitalized. “Our leader and former councillor Arun Bhowmik was beaten by BJP-backed goons with rods and bamboo. Twelve of our workers had to be hospitalized. Bhowmik got seven stitches on his head,” said state food minister and district Trianamool chief Jyotipriya Mallick. At Belgharia’s Ranipark, four persons were injured after Trinamool supporters clashed with BJP men. BJP alleged some Trinamool men had torn BJP candidate Raju Banerjee’s poster and had beaten up when BJP workers protested. Trinamool denied the allegations. At West Mindapore’s Keshpur, Trinamool supporters blocked the road for two hours with the body of Uttam Dolui, who was murdered hours before Wednesday’s polls at the Dadpur party office. A BJP worker was hurt and his house allegedly damaged by Trinamool workers in Goalshini in Chandrakona. BJP candidate Shibram Das alleged the worker was a booth agent on Thursday and ignored threats from Trinamool leaders, which triggered the attack. The local Trinamool leadership denied the allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/clashes-break-out-in-pockets-a-day-after-phase-ii-polls/articleshow/81877450.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty

This year, electrification work has been done on 561.36-km route—highest amount of work in NER, and second highest in Indian Railway in a financial year so far,” said the CPRO. “Due to the lockdown in the beginning of FY 2020-21, passenger services were stopped, and only freight services continued to ensure the uninterrupted supply of essential commodities. Traditional freight was also affected during the period. NER turned this challenge into an opportunity, and constituted business development units (BDU) at divisional level,” said Singh. “Automobile transportation in several parts of the country and in Bangladesh started which led to 180% increase in automobile loading in comparison to last FY. Freight loading has increased by 10% in comparison to the previous financial year.

Well, there’s a little breather from authorities of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport. A day after the city airport authorities implemented the new parking tariff, a decision was taken to extend the free window for dropping off passengers to 10 minutes. So commercial or private vehicles dropping off someone at the departures area will need to get a parking ticket and if they exit within 10 minutes, no charges will be levied. However, if the vehicle takes longer, one will have to pay Rs 90 for up to 30 minutes and Rs 150 from 30 minutes to two hours.“Based on further discussions and considering the feedback from our stakeholders and passengers, the AAIAL management has decided to increase the time limit for free passage to drop passengers. The time limit has been increased from 5 minutes to 10 minutes. The change in time limit will be applicable from midnight of April 2,” according to a statement issued by Adani Ahmedabad International Airport Limited.“Going forward we are implementing special drop zone for passengers with reduced mobility, mothers with infants and expectant mothers. To improve and smoothen vehicular movement within the airport premises, we have made changes in the parking fees as well as in the organization of parking zones,” the statement further added.However, passengers are still bearing the brunt of charges imposed on entering the arrivals area. As part of the new parking tariff, all private or commercial vehicles coming to pick up passengers are now charged Rs 90 to enter the arrivals area.“The car, whether a cab or a private vehicle, will be allowed to wait at the arrivals area for 5-7 minutes. If at all the vehicle is waiting for long, security deployed at the area will direct the car to be parked in the dedicated parking space available. If one exits the arrival area within 30 minutes, one will not be charged more than Rs 90. However, if the waiting time exceeds 30 minutes, a charge of Rs 150 will be levied from customers for up to two hours,” said a source.The new tariff implementation led to a lot of resistance by both cab drivers as well as travellers who moved towards the city airport. “We understand the need for regulations to keep the traffic well-managed. But what’s the logic behind charging passengers?” asked Shrijan Shah, a Maninagar resident who had come to pick up his relative on Friday.Several passengers were seen walking till the airport circle from where they could take cabs or autorickshaws so that the additional charge could be avoided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/svpi-extends-free-window-for-dropping-fliers-to-10-mins/articleshow/81877152.cms||---

We shall win all 31 seats from South 24 Parganas,” the MP from Diamond Harbour said. Referring to BJP’s Diamond Harbour candidate and Trinamool defector Dipak Haldar, Banerjee said, “The one who turned out to be a traitor will lose his election deposit this time.” Taunting Union home minister Amit Shah for reportedly cancelling his rally in the district, Banerjee alleged the BJP has failed to gain ground here. “Since he knew there will be a low turnout at the rally, which was organized in support of the BJP candidate who cheated with our party, Shah gave it a miss,” he said. While campaigning for the party’s Diamond Harbour candidate Pannalal Haldar on Friday, Banerjee said none from BJP, Congress or CPM can match the candidates of South 24 Parganas this time. Banerjee also addressed the allegations of “cut money” during disbursal of the Amphan relief fund that has hit Trinamool hard. He said he will build homes for anyone who has not found one. During his rallies at Basanti, Kultali and Baruipur East earlier in the day, Banerjee attacked the policies of the Modi government while praising the CM. Banerjee said the fund, allocated by the Centre, was being claimed as money sent by the PM by the ministers from Centre. He said the fund sent to Bengal was collected by imposing taxes on the people in the state and should not be treated as money from their own pockets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/time-for-traitors-to-bite-the-dust/articleshow/81877462.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty

---||Business||CHS, RWAs’ sinking fund receipts to face 18% GST||Mumbai: The Karnataka Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) has held that contributions collected from members of a co-operative housing society (CHS) towards a sinking fund — meant for future upkeep of the society — are subject to the goods and services tax (GST) at 18%. It further held that the GST levy would be triggered upon receipt of the amount from the members and not in the future when the sinking fund is actually utilised, such as for painting of the building and common areas, or replacement or repairs of assets such as lifts or generators. The residents’ welfare association (RWA) of the Bengaluru-based Olety Landmark Apartments had approached the AAR to ascertain whether it is liable to pay GST on the amounts which it collects from its members towards the sinking fund (also termed as corpus fund). The basic foundation of GST is that it is a tax on the ‘supply’ of goods or services. The CHS was collecting contributions from its members towards the sinking fund as it was required to do so under the bylaws (statute), it stated in its submissions. The RWA contended that the amounts collected towards the sinking fund are in the nature of a ‘deposit’ for future planned or unplanned events and not for the purpose of supplying any goods or services. Thus, the sums collected for this purpose should be outside the GST ambit. It explained that the accounts of the sinking fund are maintained separately and the funds will be utilised for the specific purposes and not for regular maintenance activities. However, the AAR distinguished between a ‘deposit’ and an ‘advance’. It held that an amount that is not returnable to the members cannot be termed as a deposit. It also stated that the bylaws of the CHS were silent on whether the amounts so collected are refundable. Hence, the contributions are undoubtedly advances for future supply of services to the members and are not deposits. While several indirect tax experts are of the view that even if the sinking fund contributions are to be treated as an advance, the GST levy should be triggered only at the time of utilisation of the fund. However, the AAR held that the GST is triggered on receipt. In other words, the CHS would have to collect and pay GST against the contributions to the sinking fund. While advance rulings are binding on the applicant and the tax department, they do have persuasive value in assessments. It should be noted that a CHS has to levy and collect GST at 18% if the charges collected from members exceed Rs 7,500 per month, per member. A smaller CHS with an annual turnover of Rs 20 lakh or less does not have to register under GST and does not have any GST obligations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/chs-rwas-sinking-fund-receipts-to-face-18-gst/articleshow/81877713.cms||---

These projects include four flyovers, three elevated roads and a cloverleaf. After inaugurating the Tedhi Pulia flyover on Friday, defence minister and Lucknow MP Rajnath Singh said that all-round development would ensure a place for Lucknow in top three cities in the country. He requested the Union road and transport minister Nitin Gadkari, who was also present on the occasion, to grant approval to several other projects proposed by him. In response, Gadkari said: “Rajnath ji, I have already approved all the projects proposed by you before stepping on the aircraft for Lucknow.” This drew a thunderous applause from the crowd. According to estimates, over a lakh people travelling into and outside the city through Sitapur Road will enjoy hassle-free ride once the network of flyovers and a cloverleaf proposed in the area gets constructed.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala State Electricity Board dismisses corruption claims||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) has denied the allegations in connection with the long-term renewable energy purchase deal that was signed in 2019. The board has claimed that it did not enter into a direct power purchase agreement with Adani Green Energy, per se. It has also stated that there was no merit in the argument that the price per unit of power as per the agreement was exorbitantly high. KSEB chairman and managing director N S Pillai said that the board had no role in the selection of the power generator. Pillai said that KSEB had entered into the 25-year agreement through Solar Energy Corporation of India Limited (SECI), which is under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. The purchase was made as part of the Green Energy purchase obligation that the board is supposed to comply with as per the directives of the state and central power regulation commissions. "As per rules, power utilities are supposed to buy a fixed percentage of renewable -- solar or wind -- energy power every year. The power purchase agreement was reached with SECI in 2019. It had been informed that SECI would provide the power through three providers, including Adani. While 75 MW of power comes from Adani, 125 MW of wind energy comes from Senatris, and 100 MW from Spring Wind Energy. Adani energy started giving 25 MW power from March 2021," Pillai said. The board has stated that so far SECI has floated tender for the purchase of over 10,000 MW power. It added that SECI was entrusted with the purchase as it would be able to attract better prices as it engages in a bulk purchase. KSEB also refuted the allegation that it had signed the solar power purchase agreement at a higher rate. The board has claimed that only the Rajasthan government was able to attract an offer for generating solar power at a rate of Rs 1.99 per unit. "But that rate applies only to Rajasthan as they offer all basic infrastructure facilities, including land to the generator," the board stated. According to KSEB officials, it buys power at the lowest possible rate 'within the price band fixed by the regulatory commission'. KSEB has argued that the regulatory commission fixes the ratio of wind/solar energy to be purchased under the renewable energy purchase obligation and that the board cannot make any changes in this ratio, as claimed by the opposition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/board-dismisses-corruption-claims/articleshow/81877140.cms||---

The amount collected has exceeded the sum last fiscal. Most of the collections were made in the second half of the financial year or from October to March. It is a notable achievement despite the constraints and adverse circumstances created by the coronavirus pandemic during the first half of the fiscal, Yadav said. The two discoms engaged are North Bihar Power Distribution Company (NBPDC) and South Bihar Power Distribution Company (SBPDC). Remarkably, the revenue collections made during the 2020-21 fiscal is Rs1,594 crore more than the amount collected in 2019-20. The increase in the revenue collection over the 2019-20 fiscal is by record 19%, when the power availability in the state increased by only 4%, the minister said. He said the revenue collections made in the first two quarters (from April to September) was Rs1,100 crore less than that during the same period in 2019-20. As a side-effect of the achievement, the aggregate technical and commercial (AT&T) losses were also reduced, he said. The minister attributed the record revenue collections to the active engagement of the top managements of the two discoms, which kept on issuing instructions and guidelines to the field staff and officials, besides constantly monitoring the drive. “I also congratulate them for the achievements that they have made,” the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/revenue-collection-of-2-discoms-up-by-19/articleshow/81876726.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Kolkata||Two Sujits, two Sabyasachis and one Abhisek on Bidhannagar poll pitch||Kolkata: This election it is all about Dutta vs Dutta and Bose vs Bose, along with an Abhisek Banerjee — not the MP and CM’s nephew — at Bidhannagar Assembly segment that goes to polls on April 17. While sitting Trinamool MLA and fire minister Sujit Bose and former Trinamool heavyweight-turned-BJP leader Sabyasachi Dutta are key contenders, two independent candidates who are namesakes to Bose and Dutta are participating in the same election. There is also Congress candidate Abhisek Banerjee, a lawyer, in the fray. While definitely not a unique phenomenon but a ploy often used by political parties to cut votes of their opponents, this is the first such example of use of dummy candidates against popular leaders this election. Lake Town resident and neighbour of minister Bose, 58-year-old marketing consultant Sabyasachi Dutta is an Independent candidate who claims to have played with the original Dutta and the fire minister in their youth. “It is just a coincidence that I share the same name as the former mayor. It was my childhood dream to contest in an election. I retired from a corporate job two years ago and now I want to serve people of my area,” said Dutta, who said he was an active SFI worker in college and later became a Trinamool sympathizer. He said he won’t be campaigning like his namesake. “I don’t have so much money. I have some friends who are campaigning for other leaders in the area and they will do a whisper campaign for me,” he said. The other dummy candidate — 58-year-old Barasat resident Sujit Bose — was too shy to speak to TOI. He responded to a call on Friday morning and said he was busy. He had promised to respond within 30 minutes, but failed to reply to multiple calls or texts. Political analysts said fielding candidates with similar names is a negative strategy used by rival parties to create confusion so that votes for a candidate from an established political party get divided. During a closely fought election, such a strategy often becomes very effective. However, both minister Bose and Trinamool turncoat Dutta said they were not bothered about the dummy candidates. “They can field a 100 Sabyasachi Duttas, but people in this area know the real Sabyasachi and will vote for me,” said the former Bidhannagar mayor, clarifying that he doesn’t know any of the two namesakes. Two-time MLA Bose also said he is not bothered about the proxy candidates. “There are others to worry about, including a criminal who now works for BJP and has registered himself as a candidate for this seat,” he said. Although it is not illegal, the Election Commission has been attempting to keep tabs on dubious contestants. An EVM has the name, photograph and symbol of a candidate beside the button. At Bidhannagar, nine candidates are participating, including five independents, a Bahujan Samaj Party candidate and Congress’s Abhisek Banerjee. “I realise I have a namesake in MP Abhishek Banerjee. My academics and the person I am have helped me establish my own identity. I do not need to write ‘nephew’ before my name,” said Banerjee, a 39-year-old data architect with a multinational software development concern.

They allegedly consumed the liquor on Thursday night. The man who suffered damage to his eyesight has been referred to Aligarh medical college in serious condition. Four persons, including the former village head, have been arrested while three licensed shops were sealed after they were found to be selling spurious liquor. The shop from where the liquor was purchased was in the name of one Mala Singh and police are trying to arrest her. “Action will also be taken against the excise inspector, local police out-post in-charge and several others,” said senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Budaun Sankalp Sharma. Spurious liquor continues to flow in parts of Uttar Pradesh which is going to polls to elect local body representatives next month. On Thursday, two persons died in Ayodhya while the death toll in Pratapgarh hooch tragedy climbed to seven. Last week, four persons had died in Pratapgarh district while eight had succumbed in Chitrakoot. District magistrate Deepa Ranjan along with the SSP rushed to the village and met the family members of the deceased. The bodies were sent for autopsy and the kin were assured of compensation. The victims were identified as Sanjay Singh and Premdas. Amar Singh lost eyesight. SSP Sharma told TOI, “The liquor was distributed by Satyabhan and Ram Swaroop who are planning to contest upcoming Zila Panchayat elections. Money was given to Ram Kishore who bought liquor from the licensed shop of Mala Singh. Satyabhan’s younger brother Brijbhan was also involved in the distribution. All four were arrested and during questioning we found that several other people are involved in this spurious liquor racket.” “During investigation, we found that spurious liquor was packed and sold as genuine for quick money. The bottles, caps and packaging labels having barcodes were supplied by another person. The role of liquor store staff is also being probed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/spurious-liquor-served-by-panchayat-poll-aspirants-leaves-2-dead-another-without-eyesight-in-ups-budaun/articleshow/81877138.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

However, Nawada district administration claimed only 11 deaths so far and, too, due to various other reasons. CM Nitish Kumar on Friday said the special team will inquire into the deaths in Nawada. “I have asked the senior authorities about these deaths. Officers in Nawada are giving statements but keeping in view the news being published in newspapers, a special team from Patna has been sent there to look into each and every aspect and take necessary action required in the matter,” Nitish said. Meanwhile, the deceased on Friday included an 18-year-old Akash Kumar from Gondapur village. ‘Heart attack’ was mentioned as the reason for his death in the inquest report prepared after his body was brought to the Sadar hospital for postmortem. The two others who died of suspected hooch poisoning were Ramdhani Sao, 50, from Kanhai Nagar and Munna Kumar of New Area. While Akash and Ramdhani died in Nawada, Munna passed away during treatment at a private hospital in Patna. The postmortem of Ramdhani and Akash was conducted at Nawada Sadar hospital and that of Munna at Nalanda Medical College and Hospital in Patna. When asked, Nawada civil surgeon Dr Akhilesh Kumar Mohan told TOI over the phone that there was a very remote possibility of an 18-year-old’s death due to heart attack. “Police had filled up the reason of death as heart attack in the inquest report while completing necessary documentation for postmortem. His body was brought with Ramdhani for postmortem in connection with the suspected hooch deaths. Their viscera have been preserved,” Dr Mohan said. When contacted, Nawada SP Dhurat Saayli Savlaram admitted that the boy’s family members had told the police about his liquor consumption. “The family members might have initially mentioned heart attack. However, they later gave a written statement that Akash had consumed liquor. We will be going by whatever has been given in writing to the police,” she said. In reply to other queries, the SP said the official suspected death count is 11 out of which three on Friday. “Out of the 11 deaths, the family members of five persons have submitted in writing that they had consumed liquor. On the basis of their written complaints, five separate FIRs have been registered against unknown persons with the Town police station,” the SP said. DM Yash Pal Meena could not be contacted over his official cellphone number as didn’t pick up the first call and disconnected the second one. On Thursday evening, his official cellphone was found to be switched off. Complete prohibition was declared in the state on April 5, 2016. The deaths started taking place during Holi. Besides Nawada, two suspected deaths from hooch poisoning have also been reported from Begusarai and five from Rohtas during Holi. Investigation in all the cases was going on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/suspected-hooch-claims-3-more-lives-in-nawada/articleshow/81876791.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Ashokan pillars at Rampurva in West Champaran are no different. One has to take uneven roads across the agricultural fields to visit the site. And the brick kilns near the pillars speak volume of how such an important historical place has been ignored. Jogendra Manjhi, 50, the caretaker of this site, said only three to four people come to see the pillars. He said had there been a road, the number of visitors would have been more. Manjhi, who gives the details of Lord Buddha and King Ashoka to the visitors, has his own grievances. “I have been working here for the past 30 years with a hope of getting a permanent job. Now that hope is waning. I started with Rs10 per day and now I get Rs6,000 per month,” he said. Former head of history department at Patna University, professor Daisy Narain said, “It is only at Rampurwa that the twin pillars are found. While one pillar has edicts inscribed, another has no inscription. One pillar had a bull and another had a lion. While the bull capital has been placed at Rashtrapati Bhavan, the lion capital is at Indian Museum in Kolkata.” She said the government should involve local people for taking care of such important sites and added that smoke in the vicinity will harm it. Shiv Kumar Mishra, a member of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage and also in charge of Gandhi Memorial at Bhitiharwa, said, “These pillars were in the open with only the inscribed portion covered from top. Because of rainfall, these were getting corroded. However, a shed was made some four to five years back. But that too hardly protects it from rainfall and can blow away in heavy wind.” Mishra said not only these twin pillars, but the area nearby has also a rich history. For instance, Bhitiharwa Ashram set up by Mahatma Gandhi in 1917 is nearly 4km away from these pillars. “In fact, at Bhitiharwa Ashram, six to eight people come daily, in spite of the fact that there is no facility of public transport to reach there and visitors have to book private vehicles,” he added. When told about the neglect of Rampurva pillars, state art, culture and youth department minister Alok Ranjan said he will get the site inspected by a team and take necessary steps. “I will also write to the district magistrate to know the situation,” said Ranjan, adding, “As far as construction of road or promoting of this site is concerned, it will be done by the tourism department.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/historical-rampurva-site-remains-neglected/articleshow/81876931.cms||Sheezan Nezami

---||Kolkata||Mahua Moitra’s ‘rowak-er chhele’ jibe for PM Modi’s ‘Didi, O Didi’ call||KOLKATA: Trinamool MP Mahua Moitra reacted strongly to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “cheap” “Didi-o-Didi” call during an election rally on Thursday, comparing the jibe to taunts from a “streetside fellow”. “The way the Prime Minister referred to our chief minister was similar to that of a ‘rowak-er chhele’, which means a streetside fellow, who sits at street corners and calls out to every woman walking past, saying Diddi, ei Diddi,” Moitra said on Friday. “It sounds so bad. The way the words were thrown at, it pinches every Bengali woman’s ears like a catcall.” Moitra criticised the Prime Minister for mocking Banerjee in such a “cheap manner”. “Would he refer to his mother, sister or even the estranged wife in a similar manner?” said Moitra. “And Mamata Banerjee is a chief minister of Bengal, where crores respect her.” But state BJP spokesperson and Rajarhat-Gopalpur candidate Samik Bhattacharya said he found nothing wrong in Modi’s connotations. “People in Bengal are witness to the way Trinamool has been addressing the Prime Minister and the words Modiji uses in his speeches. People can easily differentiate, which one is rhetoric and which one is abusive,” said Bhattacharya. Addressing a rally in Howrah’s Uluberia on Thursday, Modi had criticised chief minister Mamata Banerjee even as the second phase of polling was underway at Nandigram, where the chief minister was forced to stay cooped inside a booth at Boyal for two hours amid complaints that BJP workers were not allowing people to vote; a clash soon broke out between the supporters of the two parties outside the booth. “Didi, your action shows that you are losing from Nandigram. Your action shows that you have given up. Didi, O Didi... there is a rumour that you will file a nomination from another constituency. Is there any truth to it?” Modi had said at the public meeting. Trinamool dubbed Modi’s claim “laughable and weird” and questioned why was the Prime Minister “desperate enough” in trying to influence voters when polling was on in Nandigram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mahuas-rowak-er-chhele-jibe-for-pms-didi-o-didi-call/articleshow/81877469.cms||---

The drug is a vital part of the Covid-19 treatment protocol. According to chemists, the supply is one-fifth of the demand. Pharma companies directly supply remdesivir to private hospitals and chemists. Relatives of patients in home quarantine buy the medicine on doctors’ advice. Mayursinh Jadeja, the president of Chemist Association, Rajkot, said: “There was a need for 350 remdesivir injections on Thursday, but we got only 94.” Jadeja added: “Some big hospitals have a stock of the injections. I sent two to three patients to such hospitals to acquire the medicine because it was an emergency. But the requests were denied.” Hiren Thanki, the owner of a medical store on Vidhyanagar main road, said: “Patients being treated at home are struggling to get remdesivir.” Twelve private hospitals and the government-run PDU Hospital treat Covid patients currently in Rajkot. Dr Jay Dhirwani, the president of Rajkot Medical Association, said: “The hospitals are also facing a remdesivir shortage, but we believe that it’s temporary.” “Remdesivir’s prices dropped suddenly. As the financial year was ending, pharma companies might have stopped the supply to calculate GST properly,” he said. P B Pandya, additional district collector, said: “PDU Hospital received enough supply by Friday morning. According to our talks with the state government, private hospitalswill get the supply by Saturday morning.” The shortage was felt only for a few hours, Pandya said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/amid-ncov-spike-rajkot-runs-out-of-remdesivir/articleshow/81877587.cms||---

As per the agenda put out by the civic body for this meeting, the council would deliberate over the measures to be taken to control pollution in Vizag city under the National Clean Air Programme, a complete facelift to Mudasarlova park with Rs 50 crore, summer action plan to tide over water shortage, utilising the services of 38 community guards for protection in the beach areas and construction of a urban primary health care centre in Muslim Thatichetlapalem,. Surprisingly, the agenda included an item for payment of Rs 72 lakh bills, which the GVMC spent during Cyclone Titli in 2018. This may attract criticism from the corporators of the opposition parties as it has already been three years since the cyclone, which ravaged north-coastal Andhra Pradesh. As per the agenda copies given to the corporators, the GVMC spent Rs 72 lakh for water distribution through tankers and distribution of water sachets in Srikakulam district in 2018. Apart from the listed items in the agenda, issues such as proposed steel plant privatisation, property tax hikes and infrastructural issues may crop up during the meeting of the first council. P Murthi Yadav, Jana Sena corporator from the 22nd ward, said that it is very surprising to see an agenda item on cyclone bills. “I do not know what the GVMC officials did all these years without settling the bills. We would discuss infrastructural challenges in various parts of the city during the meeting,” said Murthi Yadav. Mudasarlova Water Works and Park, constructed during British rule in 1902, is one of the oldest existing parks in the region. The reservoir located next to the park is one of the drinking water sources of the city. The park, which was a popular picnic spot, lost its sheen and now lies in utter neglect. An in-principle approval of the council would be sought during the meeting on April 9 to renovate the park with about Rs 50 crore. Once it is approved, a request for proposal (RfP) would be floated to invite consultants for park development. As part of its ‘summer action plan-2021’, the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal proposed works worth Rs 3.16 crore to prevent water woes during the summer months. Besides proposing about 123 new borewells in various parts of the city, repairs would also be taken up on existing hand borewells and pipeline network. Additional tankers would be plied to the suburbs and tail-end areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/gvmc-councils-first-meeting-with-10-point-agenda-on-apr-9/articleshow/81876430.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

According to Tadepalli police sources, after two inmates fell sick and contracted the virus, the circle inspector was sent on a 14-day-long home quarantine. The other three accused present in the police cell have also showed symptoms of fever and Covid-19 tests have been conducted on them as well. Officials said that all the police personnel are being tested as well as on Friday morning. Eventually, the two accused who tested positive have been sent to the government hospital for treatment. Officials said that further decisions would be taken after the test results return. Police said that they are trying to trace the primary contacts of the accused who tested positive. This is a second significant outbreak at a government establishment in Tadepalli after 10 employees tested positive at the municipal office earlier in March. Eventually, Tadepalli officials had beefed up enforcement of Covid-19 guidelines. On March 27, the municipal commissioner imposed a fine of Rs 28,000 against 25 Andhra Pradesh secretariat employees for allegedly violating Covid-19 guidelines and celebrating a birthday party at the municipal guest house without taking prior permission. Tadepalli, which is the residence of chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, has turned into a hotspot over the past few weeks with the recent rise in Covid-19 cases. The circle inspector at Tadepalli police station was sent on 14-day home quarantine while another three accused in the police cell have been tested||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/two-detainees-test-ve-at-tadepalli-ps/articleshow/81876527.cms||---

Tiwari was accompanying the nuns in the train and had lodged a written complaint with Jhansi GRP against the nuns. The action comes two weeks after the report of the two nuns being harassed and deboarded at Jhansi from a running train after they were accused of taking two young girls for religious conversion hit the headlines. The arrested persons have been identified as Ajay Shankar Tiwari, office-bearer of ABVP, Anchal Arjaria, president of Rashtra Bhakt Sangathan and Purgesh Amaria, secretary of Hindu Jagran Manch. As per the Jhansi police, punitive action was taken against the people involved in misbehaviour towards nuns and adolescent girls in the Utkal Express on March 19. Arjaria and Amaria were also planning a protest accusing police of lack of action against the nuns, said a senior police official. As per SP GRP Lucknow, Saumitra Yadav, who holds additional charge of Jhansi and was the IO of the incident, all the three have been arrested under section 151 of CrPC as preventive measure as they were accused of creating ruckus at the railway station. “All the three have been sent to jail till April 6 and will be again presented before the court on April 7. During the investigation it was found that Tiwari and Arjariya was the main accused in the whole incident,” he added. Two nuns — Livia Thomas and Hemlata — along with two girls Shweta and Bitrang were travelling to Rourkela in B2 compartment of Utkal Express from Delhi on March 19. ABVP leader Tiwari was also travelling in the next compartment of the same train. Seeing the nuns and the two girls, he informed Jhansi GRP about suspicion of religious conversion. Tiwari also flashed the message to Jhansi GRP along with some Hindu outfit leaders who gathered at the Jhansi railway station. Later, he had also given a written complaint at the GRP station accusing the nuns of forceful conversion of the girls accompanying them. On reaching Jhansi, all the four were deboarded from the train and interrogated on the basis of Tiwari’s information for around three hours at the GRP station. The complaint was found baseless and all four were allowed to leave after the facts were established. The matter took a political turn a few days later when Kerala CM P Vijayan wrote to Union home minister Amit Shah drawing his attention towards the entire incident and asking for proper action. Addressing a rally the same day, Shah promised a prompt action in the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/abvp-cadre-held-for-harassing-nuns-in-jhansi/articleshow/81876733.cms||---

Public sector banks, private sector banks and even the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are moving back to last year’s system of working when Covid cases were first on the rise. Bankers said that there was a feeling of deja vu because of the increasing coronavirus numbers. The return to WFH comes at a time when banks were seeing more employees attend office following the roster system from February this year. The return to work had resulted in larger crowds in business districts. However, recently banks recorded multiple cases among staff members, forcing a return to WFH. Private sector banks like Axis and HDFC Bank are cutting down office visits. Public sector banks are also placing curbs on allowing visitors into the corporate office. Although 80% of the staff of a bank are in branches which have been working all year, key executives in the controlling offices have been working from home. Some banks were hoping to ring in a new normal from April 1, but have now postponed plans. “We were hoping that bank staff, who are categorised as essential service workers, would be made eligible for early vaccination. Since that has not happened, we are encouraging eligible staff to get vaccinated and reimbursing the same,” said a senior official with a private sector bank. Most banks are compensating staff for the cost of the vaccination. While banks are allowing staff to work from home, some are requiring the employees to be in Mumbai and login from within the city. In the insurance sector, Aegon Life (in which the Times Group has an equity stake) has formalised a ‘Work from Anywhere (WFA)’ policy effective April 1. With the introduction of this practice, all Aegon Life employees will have the flexibility and convenience to work from anywhere in India and contribute to organisational growth. “We are not only the first life insurance company but are among the first organisations in the country to formally adopt a fully WFA work policy. Needless to say, we will still have our office space to enable employees to meet, brainstorm, connect and collaborate,” said Aegon Life chief people officer Sunita Rath. She added that with WFA as the new normal, the company will adopt other suitable digital tools and solutions to engender a culture of agile policies and proactive support.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/covid-surge-derails-banks-plans-to-get-back-to-hqs/articleshow/81877682.cms||Mayur Shetty

The surge follows the second wave of infections that hit the country in February 2021. ICICI Lombard General Insurance’s head of claims Sanjay Datta said that March 2021 has recorded last year’s peak figures driven by claims filed from Maharashtra. Coronavirus: Live updatesBajaj Allianz General Insurance’s head of health claims Bhaskar Nerurkar said, “Claims applied for Covid treatment have gone up by 50% at 150 claims per day in March, as compared to the lowest recorded in January at 100 claims per day.” On the brighter side, the average ticket size of claims has seen a 10-20% drop to Rs 93,000 as compared to the levels seen in the previous year. This decline is attributed to hospitals closing down special Covid treatment wards in the last few months after seeing a steady decline in the number of infections reported, said Nerurkar. Liberty General Insurance said that Covid claims, which have almost doubled in recent weeks compared to a month ago, are likely to increase further as there is a lag in reporting the reimbursement of claims by some customers. Liberty General Insurance president & head of claims Udayan Joshi said Maharashtra tops the chart with almost 30% of the total Covid claims reported to us, followed by Karnataka, Gujarat, and Madhya Pradesh. Within Maharashtra, most claims come from Mumbai and Pune. “With the line of treatment remaining largely unchanged, there is not much movement in the average claim size in the recent months. The average amount per claim is stable at Rs 95,000-98,000,” Joshi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/second-wave-pushes-covid-health-claims-up-27-at-10l/articleshow/81877341.cms||Mamtha Asokan

The VMC opposition has now raised difficult questions that the civic body is finding difficult to reply. Reports had indicated that crematoriums and those involved with body disposal were working overtime. Corporator from the opposition Congress party in the VMC, Ami Ravat, reached the Khaswadi crematorium — the biggest in the city — late on Thursday night and checked records there. Ravat said that at 11pm on Thursday night, the records at the crematorium revealed that 28 bodies had been cremated there in 23 hours. “Even as we were standing there, two more arrived. We were told that eight more were scheduled to arrive there. This is abnormally high and the figure of only one crematorium in the city and does not include graveyards,” she said. Ravat pointed out that when she had questioned the VMC health officer about several persons testing positive in rapid antigen tests, but the official data not reflecting these, she was told that antigen tests were not confirmatory and hence not counted. “I was told that the data includes only RT-PCR tests from the two government laboratories. The RT-PCR tests of private laboratories and the rapid tests are not accounted for,” she said. An alarming situation that Ravat pointed out was that patients were being asked to isolate at home after testing positive at urban health centres. “They use public transport to go back home, purchase medicines and groceries while returning home. At home too, they may not have facilities to quarantine. The situation is alarming,” she said adding that the government needs to start isolation facilities where such persons can go. Ravat and her husband, state Congress spokesperson Narendra Ravat, have submitted a memorandum regarding various issues pertaining to Covid-19 to the district collector. They said that they would try to meet deputy chief minister Nitin Patel if he visited the city on Saturday. VMC's medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel said that the data provided by VMC included all RT-PCR positive cases. He said deaths were declared as and when their audits were completed by the death audit committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vmc-in-tight-spot-over-official-covid-death-data/articleshow/81877466.cms||---

All eight prisoners were admitted to Rajahmundry Government Hospital. According to deputy superintendent Venkata Raju, all eight prisoners were kept in quarantine barracks after being admitted to prison in March. It has been made mandatory to keep each new admission in the quarantine block for 14 days before they are sent to their respective blocks. The prison has 12 quarantine barracks, with 15 prisoners in each block. Three of the remand prisoners complained of fever two days ago after which they were tested for Covid-19.

The district administration is in the process of completing land acquisition for the project. GMR group inked an agreement with the state government to develop Bhogapuram International Airport in June 2020. Works were to have started in August 2020 and completed by 2023. However, work is yet to begin due to incomplete land acquisition. Bhogapuram airport will provide air connectivity to the north-coastal districts of Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam. The state government is planning to provide road and rail connectivity to Vizag from the airport. The Vizianagaram district administration has acquired around 2,552 acres for the project Speaking to TOI, joint collector, Vizianagaram, G Ch Kishore, said excepting 123.4 acres, which are sub-judice, the remaining land is being handed over to the project proponent. “We are in the process of acquiring another 80 acres of land for the approach road, terminal and runway of the project. Initially, farmers opposed land acquisition citing their dwelling units will be affected, now farmers have realised that land acquisition would not affect their units and the issue has been resolved,” he said. The district administration also fast tracked the rehabilitation and resettlement (R and R) package and some displaced persons in the project will occupy new colonies built under the R and R package. As Vizag is proposed to become the executive capital, work on the airport may start in coming months. As per plans, the airport is expected to handle 6.3 million passengers annually in the first phase and will increase it to 18 million depending on demand. B Raja Srinivas, president, Credai, Andhra Pradesh, said once the airport is operational, Vizag and Vizianagaram will emerge as twin cities on the lines of Hyderabad and Secunderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/land-acquisition-for-bhogapuram-airport-fast-tracked/articleshow/81876579.cms||Nalla.Babu

Titled the ‘Impact of the pandemic Covid-19 on youth, women and family – the perceptions of educated youth’, the study explored various facets of the pandemic and lockdown, and their impact on family bonding, career and job prospects, online education, gender roles, etc. Speaking to TOI, Dr Usha said Covid-19 taught many lessons. “Thanks to the prolonged lockdown, men understood the gender disparity in domestic responsibilities. Generally, it has not been the case as several women have to precariously balance household chores and jobs or other works. At least three-fourths of the study respondents rooted for distribution of domestic work as they observed a significant positive change in their attitude during the lockdown period,” said Dr Usha. Dr Usha added that even though people had a hard time adjusting to the new normal of working and studying from home, the lockdown strengthened bonding among family members as they spent quality time together. “The striking point was the majority of youth are not particular about the norms of marriage and family institutions as they prioritise career. A noteworthy point was that half of the study participants did not witness any violence against women and girls in their family or neighbouring households,” said Dr Usha. Findings of the study also show that some respondents were confused about career and education due to the pandemic. The study tried to derive the opinions of the student community on transition to online learning and exams. Several respondents felt the government should make targeted investments in IT infrastructure to facilitate internet services at cheaper prices for online classes and skill development, particularly in unserved and rural areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/more-men-took-on-household-chores-in-lockdown-study/articleshow/81876538.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The annual festival of the local deity atop the hill is to be held on Sunday. Officials of the mines and geology department, however, said that they have granted permission for mining of coloured granite after following procedures. Two quarry leases for coloured granite were granted and executed in favour of MSSS Srinivas over an extent of nine hectares in survey number 323 and for M Madhupriya over an extent of six hectares in survey number 323 of Lakshminarayanapuram in Parvathipuram. Both parties applied for the lease for a period of 20 years. Locals said that mining would destroy the temple of the Goddess Bodamma and affect rainfed irrigation on over 200 acres near Bodikonda. Mining will also lead to pollution in the area. Locals have been dependent on resources from the hill for the past several decades. Officials said that the land under survey number 323 in Lakshminarayanapuram abuts VN Puram, an uninhabited village without dwellings, government buildings, graveyards or communal structures. Speaking to STOI, tehsildar (in-charge), Parvathipuram, G Srirammurthy said considering the opinions of the locals and permissions given by various departments, “we have submitted a comprehensive report to the district administration, which will take a decision. As of now, quarrying has not begun, but locals are opposing mining.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/locals-step-up-protest-against-granite-mining/articleshow/81890267.cms||---

Most of them are in dire straits and their growth is sluggish, claim academics. Charities and endowments, which used to play a major role in the growth of higher education in the state till the mid-70s, are almost missing today. Increasing state control of colleges has put a huge financial burden on the government and deprived the institutions of liberal flow of funds from donors and business houses. According to the former director of higher education, N P Sharma, there were only 29 constituent colleges belonging to six universities in the state till 1975. The private ones were nursed by a few benevolent families of zamindars and big business houses. “Universities were left free to frame academic policies and conduct examinations. However, in 1976, the then chief minister, Jagannath Mishra, made 20 affiliated colleges the constituent units of different universities, increasing their liabilities considerably. The game of mass conversion continued till 1986,” Sharma recalls. Retired chemistry teacher Mahesh Chandra also points out that large-scale conversion of private colleges into constituent units of different universities has put a big burden on the government finances. “Except Patna University (PU), which is relatively very small, all others have a large number of colleges under their jurisdiction. As the government doles out only salary grants to the universities, it is difficult for them to ensure proper growth and development of all the colleges. Besides, the quantum of public donations has become a non-entity these days,” Chandra says. A senior PU teacher claims that netas do not seem to be interested in the affairs of colleges and universities. “The government nominates some MLAs and MLCs as members of the senate, the meeting of which is held not more than once a year.

---||Kanpur||Traditional Holi Ganga mela organized amid tight security||Done/ALVI Times News Network Kanpur: Amid tight security and strict compliance with Covid protocol, the traditional Holi Ganga mela, a symbol of Ganga-Jamuni culture of Kanpur, was organized here on Friday evening. In comparison to previous editions of the mela, this year there was not much crowd and the camps organized by the city’s social organizations were also less in number. Similarly, the aura of the traditional folk songs was also missing this year because Bhojpuri Samaj and other cultural organizations did not turn up. Police had made elaborate security arrangements and barricaded all the entry points leading to Sarsaiyya ghat, the venue of Holi Mela. The district administration and the Kanpur Municipal Corporation (KMC) authorities held their camps in the middle of around one-kilometer long road from Sarsaiyya ghat to Chetna crossing and Bara Chauraha. Mayor Pramila Pandey inaugurated the KMC camp. Besides people’s representatives, including Amitabh Bajpai, Irfan Solanki (both MLAs, Prem Lata Katiyar, Salil Bishnoi, the municipal commissioner and officials of KMC, district administration and police were present in the camp. The peoples started coming to the mela from 4.30 pm, and the mela was at its peak at around 6 pm. People greeted the familiar faces and recalled their old memories. Vinod Mishra, a regular visitor of Holi Ganga Mela said, “This time due to Covid-19 pandemic, the crowd was just half in comparison to the previous years. Moreover, many visitors maintained social distancing and instead of walking along the road up to Sarsaiya Ghat, preferred to stay in the camps”. They did not embrace each other and preferred to wish them with folded hands, he added. Several newspapers published from the city also organized their camps where the people’s representatives visited to greet the journalists. Some camps also organized folk songs. The people started returning to their homes after r 6.30 pm. Earlier, the Holi festival was again celebrated in the city on Monday on the occasion of Holi Ganga Mela. A buffalo cart, loaded with colour water drums, made a round from Nayaganj to Birhana Road. The residents and the social organizations welcomed the cart on the entire route, offered sweets and threw colour water on the passersby. The event was organized by Hatia Holi Mela organizing committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/traditional-holi-ganga-mela-organized-amid-tight-security/articleshow/81876755.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Polling booth violence reaches Jadavpur senior’s home||Kolkata: Polling agents arguing against one another in a voting booth is a common election-time sight. But that is now threatening to disrupt the lives of senior citizens. An incident at the Jadavpur assembly constituency on Friday has led over 2,000-odd voters wondering if political agents will spare them the peace of mind to cast their votes from the comfort of their homes. A postal ballot cast by a bed-ridden Ashoka Mondal — an 80-year-old from Anandapally — on Friday became fraught with controversy with both CPM and Trinamool alleging that the other was trying to “pressure” her. Mondal finally appealed to the parties to keep her out of “petty politics”. CPM later lodged a case with police against some reported Trinamool supporters alleging that CPM booth agent Dilip Roy (59) was roughed up after he protested against the manner in which the vote was being cast. The Jadavpur police told TOI that a primary probe was on and a report will be filed to the Election Commission if required. According to Roy, he had reached Mondal’s home around 11.30am with the Trinamool booth agent (Jadavpur Madhyamik Balika Vidyalaya, part number 212). “I saw the polling officer holding the page for the bed-ridden voter and voting on her behalf. When I protested, I was asked to move out by the CAPF personnel. The Trinamool agent stayed back. Outside, Trinamool workers heckled and assaulted me for raising my voice,” Roy said, claiming that the BJP agent arrived once the main incident was over. The polling process at home is an elaborate one — similar to the one in a booth. “A team of poll personnel and party agents, along with a few CAPF personnel and cops go to the voter’s house. A cardboard structure is set up to allow him/her to cast the vote in secret. The ballot paper is sealed in an envelope in front of the voter. At times, the polling process is also videographed. Mondal’s family said they have no complaints against anyone. Her son-in-law said that Mondal needed help at every step of her daily life and she chose to exercise her democratic right in the best way she could have. “While the officials were following set procedures, one must remember that a more humane approach will encourage more people like her to vote,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/polling-booth-violence-reaches-jadavpur-seniors-home/articleshow/81877443.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Business||Ministry of Corporate Affairs defers mandatory audit trail rule by a year||Chennai: The ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) has deferred by a year’s time its week-old order requiring companies to use only accounting software that have ‘audit trail’ and other specified features.Earlier on March 24, the MCA had notified that starting April 1, 2021, companies must only use such accounting software that has a feature of recording audit trail for transactions, create logs of changes made to the books, and ensure that the audit trail feature cannot be disabled.However, in a notification on Thursday, the government said that this rule will only be applicable for transactions pertaining to the fiscal year beginning April 1, 2022. The deferment follows concerns voiced by small businesses and industry associations that while this helps curb fraud and bring in sound corporate governance, the timeline for implementation was going to be a compliance burden and disrupt ease of doing business.While welcoming the extension of time, industry watchers also counted this move among a series of U-turns by the govt agencies recently including the reversal of the reduction in savings rate, deferment of the new labour code, and giving more time for Pan-Aadhaar linking. “It is a pragmatic decision to defer this, otherwise this was going to be another case of a great initiative but bad execution on the government’s part, a CA, who wished to not be named,” said. Tally Solutions, one of the most widely used software with 75% market share, has a facility of disabling audit trail, and faces impact from the new rule.Tejas Goenka, MD of Tally Solutions told TOI that the deferment provides time to understand the requirement and implement appropriately. Over the next few weeks, we would be consulting with MCA, CAs, and other industry members to easily apply the terms of the notification from a practical standpoint to act in the best interests of MSME business owners, he added.“Businesses of all sizes require the time to review their operations, upgrade their systems if required, to be compliant. So, delaying the implementation by one more year surely helps, as it reduces the burden on compliance to the new transparent system that requires a mindset change as well, Kumar Vembu, founder and CEO of software firm GoFrugal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ministry-of-corporate-affairs-defers-mandatory-audit-trail-rule-by-a-year/articleshow/81877397.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

Manjhi, who has always been critical of this law, was a little soft when he said despite all efforts to implement prohibition, the result is not fruitful. “This needs to be reviewed,” Manjhi said, adding, “The government is working on prohibition and has put many people and mechanism in place, which is good. I appreciate these steps. But despite all these, if the result is not fruitful, then we need to develop another mechanism.” He further said action should be taken against all officials who are found to be negligent regardless of their rank. He also held senior officials responsible for the sale of spurious liquor in Bihar. Earlier, on several occasions, Manjhi had been more critical of the prohibition law. He had challenged the government to inspect the bungalows of ministers, legislators and senior officials, saying he would step down from politics if no liquor is found in their bungalows. Manjhi has also said that only the poor, Dalits and those from the suppressed class were being made the victim and put behind the bar, while the powerful ones were easily violating the law. His party’s spokesperson Danish Rizwan also appreciated the law but admitted it needed to be implemented better. An old letter written by Manjhi addressed to CM Nitish Kumar also went viral on social media on Friday. In this letter dated July 29, 2020, Manjhi had wished that CM Nitish may never become an ex-CM as former CMs face many problems, including a threat to life. In the letter, Manjhi had demanded Nitish to provide a free residential facility for at least 15 years, not to remove SSG from the security of former CMs along with Z+ security, Rs five lakh as travel allowance along with some other bounties. When asked how come a letter which was written more than eight months back was getting viral on Friday, Rizwan replied, “Some social media portals were running a news about this letter, after which we had posted in the group to clarify the date.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/manjhi-seeks-review-of-liquor-ban-mechanism/articleshow/81876770.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The bodies of Parmesh Singh, Mohammad Islam and Mohammad Rahmatullah, all in their 40s, lay unidentified for several hours near Nirmali village under Pipra police as no belongings, including cell phones, were found. All three are from neighbouring villages under the Town police station area in Supaul. Police said Singh and Islam were land brokers while Rahmatullah was a farmer. Pipra SHO Santosh Kumar Nirala said the spot where the three bodies were recovered is at least 30 kilometres away from their homes. Nirala said some villagers spotted the bodies around 8 am and informed the police after which their photos were circulated on social media groups for identification. “It seems they were murdered somewhere else after which the bodies were dumped in a field next to the village road in Nirmali. There were tyre marks at the spot indicating that the bodies were brought in a vehicle,” he said. The SHO said prima facie all three appeared to be beaten to death. “There are no severe injury marks on the bodies. No sign of strangulation or throttling on the trio’s neck were present. Only a few scratches were present on their legs,” Nirala said. The SHO said police suspects that the trio was murdered over a land dispute or a financial issue arising out of it. “Singh and Islam worked together while Rahmatullah knew Islam. Both dealers had left home on Thursday morning and didn’t return. Rahmatullah left home in the night. He had asked his son to drop him to a nearby village named Ekma and didn’t return afterwards,” the SHO said, adding family members were yet to report at the Town police station that they were missing.

In 2017, there were only 100 MBBS seats in BRD Medical College, Gorakhpur, but the state government increased it to 150, while another 100 seats for MBBS course have been added at the 500-bed Basti Medical College. Besides, 100 seats each have been sanctioned for MBBS course at medical colleges in Deoria and Siddharthnagar which are also ready. Since the medical college at Kushinagar and proposed medical colleges at Maharajganj and Santkabirnagar are under-construction, 300 more seats for MBBS will be available taking the total number of seats in region to 750. Earlier, patients from the seven districts of the division, in addition to bordering areas of Bihar and Nepal were totally dependent on Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College in Gorakhpur for treatment, but the state government led by CM Yogi has equipped even CHCs, PHCs and district hospitals with advanced equipment and facilities.

---||Delhi||With vax drive now open 7 days a week, corpns fear staff shortage||New Delhi: A day after directions were issued that vaccination centres would remain open on all days, including holidays, the municipalities were worried about staff crunch at their hospitals. South Delhi Municipal Corporation had decided to add two new centres on Wednesday, but was yet to get civil defence volunteers to start the facilities. At present, it is running the facilities at 44 hospitals, polyclinics and dispensaries. “On average, 43,000 people have been visiting the centres daily since January 16. But on April 1, about 5,000 people visited one centre, which prompted the increase in timings. However, our bigger worry is insufficient staff and resources,” said an SDMC official. The official added that till March 31, about 200 people were visiting Purnima Sethi Super Specialty Hospital, but on April 1 the number jumped to over 300. “Due to this, we have to add new centres and deploy more staff,” he said. North corporation mayor Jai Prakash said a meeting would be called on Monday to discuss the issue and ensure that no one feels overburdened. “There is no denying the fact that pressure will increase on health workers, which is why we have decided to deploy them in shifts and make provisions for offs/breaks after a certain interval. We have also written to the district magistrates to increase our centres from 36 to 100 and sent civil defence volunteers and other facilities. This will eventually help cater to the rush,” added Prakash. East Delhi Municipal Corporation operates 20 centres, including those at Swami Dayanand Hospital, Veer Savarkar Hospital, maternity and child care centres and polyclinics. Officials said there was a shortage of staff, which is why they had not deployed the staff in shifts and kept the working hours from 9am to 5pm. “Besides vaccination, the nursing staff even do deliveries at the maternity centres. Malaria and dengue might add to their burden in the coming days. Since the vaccination drive is going to continue for long, we need to figure out a way to make their task simpler,” said an EDMC official, adding they expected Delhi government to hire more vaccinators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/with-vax-drive-now-open-7-days-a-week-corpns-fear-staff-shortage/articleshow/81878696.cms||Vibha Sharma

Much depends on whether the closure will continue beyond seven days,” MAI secretary Prakash Chaphalkar said.He said multiplexes in several other states could operate at 100% capacity last year, but because state multiplexes were capped at 50% seating, there have been no big movie releases.In the city, many multiplexes were running on fumes — limited shows and screens, and barely 15-20 patrons per show, said sources.“New releases will definitely be postponed. The situation is very bleak — administrative costs, staff wages and rentals are going to stack up for an already industry,” Neerav Panchamia, chief operating executive of E-Square Leisure Private Limited, said.Deepak Kudale, former president of the Cinema Owners and Exhibitors Association of India, said, “Of the 18 single screen theatres in Pune, only two had reopened.

---||Business||PSU banks go slow on asset sales, await privatisation list||MUMBAI: Public sector banks that were not part of the consolidation process are going slow on their plans to monetise assets as part of their capital-raising efforts. These banks have decided to wait and see whether they are candidates for the government’s privatisation plan before initiating any stake sale. The thinking is that private investors might see more value in a bank that has other businesses that can be grown. Last week, Central Bank of India allowed a deal to sell its housing finance arm Cent Bank Home Finance to fall through by not going ahead with the transaction before the long-stop date of March 31, 2021. In terms of the deal, the public sector lender would have received Rs 160 crore. Similarly, Bank of India has been looking to sell stake in its life insurance arm, Star Union Daiichi. In good times, public sector banks have made investments in financial sector entities. But the Reserve Bank of India is now reluctant to grant permission to banks to set up subsidiaries. In her Budget, the finance minister had said that the government will privatise two public sector banks and one general insurer during the current financial year. The Niti Aayog has decided to keep the five public sector banks that were part of the consolidation — Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank, Canara Bank, Union Bank and Indian Bank — out of the privatisation process. Read Also4 PSU banks get Rs 14,500 crore in recap bondsThe government has infused Rs 14,500 crore into four weak public sector banks by issuing them recapitalisation bonds for a matching amount. The investment will improve the capital adequacy of these banks and enable three of them to exit the lending restrictions they face from the RBI.The reason for keeping the consolidated banks out of the privatisation process is that, while the merger is complete, the benefits of consolidation are yet to be realised. In the initial phase, there is expected to be a rationalisation of expenses, while in subsequent years more value is expected to be delivered through economies of scale and growth. Bank of India, Bank of Maharashtra, Indian Overseas Bank, Central Bank of India, Punjab & Sind Bank and UCO Bank are the ones that were not part of the consolidation. IDBI Bank has been classified as a private bank after Life Insurance Corporation came in as an investor. The government has said that even after privatisation, the interest of employees would be protected and there would not be any change in their salaries and that rights and perquisites of workers would be protected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/psu-banks-go-slow-on-asset-sales-await-privatisation-list/articleshow/81877669.cms||Mayur Shetty

The bodies of the couple, aged 16 and 18, were found hanging from two different branches of a Mulberry tree. Both the families have levelled allegations of murder against each other. Pilibhit SP Kirit Rathore rushed to the spot and carried out a preliminary investigation. He didn't find any signs of honour killing, so far. Their bodies have been sent for postmortem. According to police, the couple belonged to the same community and were neighbours. The girl was a school dropout while the boy used to work in Haryana as a labourer and had returned home to celebrate Holi a week ago. Recently, the couple told their parents that they wish to marry, but their families refused, police said. The primary reason behind the two families' rejection was that the girl's elder sister was still unmarried, and the boy’s family wanted to marry him elsewhere, sources said. Both the families reportedly had an argument and the girl’s kin had warned the boy to stay away from her. On Thursday evening, the couple eloped. They were found hanging by locals the next morning. When contacted, Bilsanda SHO Ravindra Kumar said, “The boy’s family was forcing him to return to work in Haryana, but he eloped with his neighbour’s daughter and was later found hanging from a tree. The two families have levelled allegations against each other, but did not give anything in writing.” Meanwhile, the SP said, “The case is under investigation and we are waiting for the autopsy report. Action will be taken accordingly. We did not find any signs of foul play.” On Tuesday, an interfaith couple was found dead under mysterious circumstances in Bareilly district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/teenage-couple-16-18-found-hanging-from-tree-in-up/articleshow/81877144.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

State Congress president Nana Patole, revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat, public works minister Ashok Chavan, energy minister Nitin Raut and other Congress leaders were among those present. “The general view was Raut’s statements had widened the rift within the Maha Vikas Aghadi to a great extent and, if there was no check, it would have an adverse impact on the stability of the government,” a senior Congress leader said. Raut’s recent statement suggesting NCP chief Sharad Pawar should head UPA has not gone down well with party leaders. “We felt since Shiv Sena is not part of the UPA, it was wrong on Raut’s part to recommend Pawar’s name as UPA president. Either H K Patil himself or a section of senior Congress ministers will meet the CM on the row over Raut’s statements,’’ he said. The Congress leader said the NCP had failed to take swift action to control the damage to government in the wake of corruption and extortion charges against home minister Anil Deshmukh. “It was expected the NCP leadership would rise to the occasion, but it took more than a week to respond to the charges against Deshmukh. The coordination committee of the three-party government should meet at regular intervals to resolve crucial issues,” he said. On the lockdown, it was felt that instead of re-lockdown, government should bring in more stringent rules and ensure stricter implementation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rauts-statements-have-widened-rift-in-mva-says-cong/articleshow/81878765.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala elections 2021: Election Commission sets up SOP to weed out duplicates||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Following a high court order, the election commission has come up with a set of standard operating procedures (SOP) to be followed before a person casts the vote in the upcoming election. The SOP is intended to ensure that only eligible voters cast their vote and duplicate voters are weeded out. In a statement, the commission said that in compliance with the high court judgment and in light of the extant instructions, the district electoral officers (DEOs) and returning officers (ROs) have been directed to provide the list of all absent, shifted, and dead or duplicate (ASDs) voters to all the presiding officers concerned. In case a voter identified as ASD visits the polling station to cast a vote, the presiding officer will follow the SoP laid down by the ECI before letting the person vote. As per the SoP, such a voter's thumb impression will be taken, in addition to his/her signature, and a declaration will also be obtained. The particular voter's photo will be captured and preserved for future reference. These measures will be in addition to checking to confirm that the indelible ink mark on the voter's finger has dried up. Anyone trying to vote in multiple places or attempting to impersonate will be prosecuted as per section 171D, 171F, etc of the Indian Penal Code. The punishment can extend up to one year of imprisonment or a fine or both. The High Court in a writ petition dated March 31, related to duplicate and multiple entries, had directed the chief electoral officer to take necessary measures to prevent duplicate voting. The Electoral Roll (ER) is joined by new electors when they become eligible, besides when electors migrate, change their address, or even the photograph. Also, dead electors have to be deleted based on information from family members. There are detailed SoPs for inclusion as well as deletion from the ER. However, the commission said that the process of deletion is far more stringent to avoid any wrongful deletion that may deprive an eligible elector of his voting right. As a result, there are instances where an elector gets enrolled at his new residence while not applying for deletion at the old address. After opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala had raised the issue of duplicate voters, the election machinery in the state had conducted a thorough field verification and came up with a list of ASD entries in the electoral roll.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ec-sets-up-sop-to-weed-out-duplicates/articleshow/81877156.cms||---

---||Goa||Glan signs three-year contract with FC Goa||Panaji: Glan Martins has signed a new contract with FC Goa that will keep him at the club till 2024. The midfielder joined Goa from ATK Mohun Bagan after the closure of the January transfer window with Lenny Rodrigues going the other way. Both players terminated their existing contracts with their clubs to make the move and are now happy to sign new deals. While Lenny will stay with ATK Mohun Bagan till 2023, Glan has now signed a three-year contract with Goa. “Glan showed that he deserves a longer contract at FC Goa. He was terrific for the club since making the move. Everyone is happy,” said a senior official. The former Sporting Clube de Goa midfielder made seven appearances for ATK Mohun Bagan this season, only three of which were starts. At Goa, he rediscovered himself, starting eight matches, including both legs of the semifinal against Mumbai City FC. After both teams had scored five penalties each, Glan missed the team’s ninth spot-kick in sudden death, allowing Rowllin Borges to clinch the semifinal tie for Mumbai. Coach Juan Ferrando has been impressed with Glan’s work-rate in the middle of the pitch and he proved to be very effective, whether he partners captain Edu Bedia or the young Princeton Rebello. His long-range strike against Mumbai City was among the best goals of the season. Glan’s impressive performances with Goa this season attracted interest from elsewhere too. But the midfielder enjoyed his time with the club and wanted to continue. “I have long been an admirer of the way the club plays football and it completely aligns with what I feel are my strengths. This is a chapter in my life that I want to make full use of,” Glan said at the time of his signing early this year. Glan joined Sesa Football Academy in 2010 and was then signed by Sporting Clube, where he spent five years. At the end of his contract, he joined Churchill Brothers FC and attracted attention from ATK Mohun Bagan after some eye-catching performances in the I-League. In his debut ISL season, Glan has a goal and assist after 919 minutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/glan-signs-three-year-contract-with-fc-goa/articleshow/81890621.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Over the last two days, 5-10% staff at many restaurants in Pune have left for their hometown after recurrent warnings of a lockdown. A few restaurateurs had also planned a peaceful dharna outside Council Hall on Saturday. However, they were still awaiting government permission for the same at the time of filing this report. PRAHA president Ganesh Shetty told TOI that a majority of restaurants that do not have a tie-up with online food ordering and delivery platforms will face difficulty in undertaking parcel services as they have limited staff. “We fear that we would see 100% staff exodus in the next few days, as parents of staffers have been frantically calling their wards back home. Warnings of an impending lockdown have predominantly centered around Maharashtra. It took over three months to get our staff back last year and we fear that the same situation could repeat this time too,” said Shetty. Lovely Narang, president of United Hospitality Association, said, “As per Friday’s announcement, a majority of businesses have been allowed to work from 6am to 6pm, then why have restaurants been ordered to shut completely for the next seven days? While local markets are seen bustling with the crowd during the day, the orders have been particularly harsh only on some sectors, including the hospitality industry.” There is still no clarity on how food courts in shopping malls would function for parcel orders, considering that the entire mall complex will be shut for the next seven days. Arun Arora, center director of Phoenix Marketcity Pune, said, “We are still awaiting clear guidelines from the authorities. If F&B outlets at malls are allowed to undertake parcel orders, then they can operate.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/week-long-closure-may-prompt-mass-exodus-of-cooks-waiters/articleshow/81878025.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Snake charmers get school in hood||AHMEDABAD: Samjunath Wadi was a world-famous magician, whose tricks included turning a brick into a venomous serpent — now, his son Gorakhnath Wadi hopes to coil the enchantments of education around snake charmers’ children. The ban on the public display of snakes has put snake charmers out of business. So Gorakhnath decided to set up a school, at Vinchiya near Sanand, for the sons and daughters of the Wadi or snake charmers’ community. Thirty-five children have already begun attending the school in this small hamlet. Called Samjunath Wadi Pathshala, the school for now comprises a temporary shed. It lies close to the area where the Wadis live, so the children are happy and their parents are reassured. With no other livelihood options, the community members were forced to beg, said Gorakhnath. “If these kids get proper education, they will be able to get jobs and earn a decent living,” said Gorakhnath, who is also a magician. The school has hired a full-time teacher. Run by a charitable trust, the school has purchased toys worth about Rs 80,000. Most of the elders of the Wadi community, clad in saffron robes, still go around begging for alms. As for the kids, this is the first experience of formal education. Apart from lessons, they also get meals. “We plan to take the kids to some nearby schools so that they can understand the importance of school learning,” Gorakhnath said. Guru Mahant, a revered figure in the Wadi community, stressed the importance of education in the pursuit of a good life. The school is based on his dreams and vision for the community. In Vinchiya, one can sense the excitement in the 300-family Wadi cluster as kids head to school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/snake-charmers-get-school-in-hood/articleshow/81877161.cms||---

---||Patna||Bettiah hospital matron busts 'Munnabhai' proxying for a doctor||BETTIAH: Far removed from the feel-good ‘Jaadu ki jhappi’ fun riot of the Bollywood blockbuster ‘Munna Bhai MBBS’, a sinister twist to this celluloid tale was busted by a vigilant hospital matron at the Government Medical College at Bettiah. “On her round on Monday afternoon during Holi, Matron Sister Helen spotted an unfamiliar young man, a stethoscope dangling around his neck, attending to patients in the paediatric ward and writing prescriptions. Her suspicion heightened by the absence of interns and junior residents for several weeks, she confronted the stranger,” MJK Hospital superintendent Dr Pramod Tiwari told this newspaper on Friday, adding, “ A case of impersonation came to light.” Confronted by the matron, the stranger identified himself as a private compounder of Dr Shaukat Ali, a paediatrician with an MD degree. “He admitted to proxying for Dr Ali, who was supposed to be on emergency duty. The matron immediately clicked his picture and alerted us on Whatsapp,” Dr Binod Prasad, principal of the Government Medical College, said. The principal soon set up a seven-member board that recommended the dismissal of Dr Ali. “His services have been terminated,” Dr Prasad said. Asked if an FIR has been lodged against the impersonator, the principal reiterated, “ Dr Ali’s services have been terminated.” The principal’s treatment of this ‘L'affaire Compounder Bhai MD’ as a closed chapter with the dismissal of the doctor is surely more than an ‘oversight’ of a stranger not only proxying for a qualified doctor but even displaying the audacity of attending to child patients admitted in the emergency and writing prescriptions nonchalantly. When this reporter asked why the compounder was allowed to go scot-free, the principal first sought to close the conversation by citing the doctor’s termination of service. How could the authorities ignore this case where unsuspecting patients admitted in the care of specialist doctors were at the mercy of a stranger? “The hospital superintendent can answer that,” principal Prasad feebly passed the buck. “Since the Medical College has come up, doctors are under the watch of the principal,” hospital superintendent Dr Tiwari said, explaining that the hospital has been functioning with interns and junior residents since the end of February. Dr Shaukat Ali, whose services have been terminated, did not respond to calls by this reporter. His mysterious proxy - the compounder- too has disappeared after his sinister cameo in the hospital emergency ward. The only silver lining in this tale is the sharp eye of Matron Helen. This Florence Nightingale, meanwhile, also could not be reached as she remained confined with her Good Friday prayers and Easter celebrations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bettiah-hosp-matron-busts-munnabhai-proxying-for-a-doc/articleshow/81877167.cms||Abhay Mohan Jha
---||Lucknow||Virtual prayer service, feasts at home to mark Easter celebration||LUCKNOW: Ringing in their holy week with home-made feasts, games by children and physical and virtual prayer services, Christians in the city are set to mark Easter celebrations on Sunday. While churches are encouraging people to partake in services maintaining Covid protocol, residents plan to celebrate Easter Sunday as a close-knit affair. Vijay Khand resident Neetu Benedict and her two siblings are looking forward to games of ‘Easter egg hunting’ and ‘golden egg hunting’. “Egg hunting is a tradition in many Christian families. Both children and adults play. Last year, due to lockdown, we couldn’t buy the items required for decoration of eggs. Therefore, we thought we should have it this time. My mother will prepare the eggs at home while my father will hide the basket around the house. Whoever finds the golden egg will be rewarded with a gift of choice,” said the 21-year-old excitedly. Vartika Kumar, a teacher, plans to prepare a lavish meal of both Indian delicacies and Easter eggs, after the prayer service with her husband and two sons. “Children get very excited during festivals. We will attend the prayer service, sing hymns in our house and in church and then my kids will help me prepare their favourite dishes,” she added. Aashiana resident Beryl McDonald said, “Easter celebration includes a very simple family get-together where we celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ by attending midnight mass on Saturday. With restrictions still in place, we will visit the church at midnight but stay home on Sunday.” Ruchi Negi, a non-Christian who has been brought up among Christians said she will watch the live-streaming of church service on Facebook. “Every Easter, I visit my convent school to pray to Mother Mary. This time, the school is not allowing visitors, hence I will view a virtual service,” added the 20-year-old. “These are extraordinary times and churches across the world are adapting. Church will be open for visitors but with precautions and a few changes to maintain safety of all,” said Reverend Father Donald D’Souza of Catholic Diocese. Eggs a symbol of renewal: Decorating Easter eggs, a symbol of fertility and renewal, is an age-old custom. “Eggs are a symbol of rebirth, and Easter is a day when Jesus Christ was resurrected. That’s why Easter eggs are a symbol of renewal,” said Father Morris Kumar of Assembly of Believer’s Church. On Easter Sunday, children decorate Easter eggs in vibrant colours. Egg-shaped chocolates, hand-carved wooden eggs are also popular now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/virtual-prayer-service-feasts-at-home-to-mark-easter-celebration/articleshow/81878787.cms||Aditi Singh

A notification issued by the civic body states that property tax returns will now be accepted only through online mode. Filing of returns manually has been discontinued. The order issued by the accessor and collector office states that the move is aimed at increasing transparency and efficiency. “In accordance with the guidelines of ease of doing business, it has been decided that property tax returns shall only be accepted by online mode from April 1, 2021.” Delhi’s three municipal corporations have been moving their several services, including the property tax payment, to online mode in phases. Recently, South Delhi Municipal Corporation had uploaded all the old property tax returns records online. A new property tax portal was also developed last year, but taxpayers have been facing several glitches while using it. Meanwhile, the corporations managed to increase their property tax collection in 2020-21 despite the Covid-19 pandemic. North corporation mayor Jai Prakash said that they collected about Rs 645 crore as against the preceding year’s collection of Rs 548 crore. The number of taxpayers also increased by 5,000. A total of 4,23,000 people paid taxes last financial year. About 48,000 taxpayers have availed the benefit of our amnesty scheme, which was launched in January this year, said the mayor. About Rs 230 crore has been collected in the scheme, while taxpayers, who availed its benefit, got relief of a total of around Rs 500 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/east-corpn-residents-will-now-have-to-pay-property-tax-online/articleshow/81891604.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

On Wednesday, nearly eight acres of crop was burnt after the garbage heap in an adjacent field was set on fire by unidentified persons in Rampur. And, on the same day, about 30 acres of wheat crop was reduced to ashes after sparks falling from high-tension wires in Banda and Kaant area of Shahjahanpur fell on them. Over 15 acres of crop was completely burnt in Shahjahanpur district’s Eknaura village and four acres of the crop was lost in Katra block on Friday due to the fire.Darshan Singh, who lost nearly 9 acres of standing crop, told TOI, “My wheat crop was destroyed within a few minutes. Breaking the chain of fire by ploughing the field with tractor or other equipment is the only way to control the blaze. But wind spreads it rapidly. We were told that our crop was insured, but we have not been given document by anyone. We were told that farmers would be able to share the details online, but couldn’t do it. We feel cheated.”Vishal Saini, a farmer from Rampur, told TOI, “Our field was adjacent to a garbage dumping ground. Someone lit the garbage and the fire spread to our field because of the wind. Our standing crop was reduced to ashes. No compensation has been announced so far by the municipal corporation which had dumped the garbage.”In several parts, overhead wires are causing the fire. According to farmers, over 12 fire incidents were reported from Bijnor district in the last 15 days. And over 20 hectare of standing crop has been destroyed due to this.According to Madan Singh, a farmer of Mandawali area, “Power lines are the leading cause of agricultural fire.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/wheat-crop-on-hundreds-of-acres-gutted-in-fire-incidents-in-western-up-in-15-days/articleshow/81877157.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The woman’s husband, Vitthal Bhikule (46), was driving the car. He lost control of the wheel while negotiating a sharp turn known as ‘Mavlai Valan’ and the car fell into the backwaters, said assistant inspector Manoj Pawar of the Velhe police. “Bhikule, an employee of a private company, tried to save his wife Alpana (45), and daughters Prajakta (21), Praneeta (17) and Vaidehi (8), but in vain. He then swam to the bank and alerted residents of the area,” Pawar said. Bhikule and his wife managed to come out of the car after it plunged in the water. However, the wife could not swim and drowned. A team from the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority’s (PMRDA) fire brigade later recovered her body. Their daughters could not come out of the car. Pawar said the Bhikules hail from Vihir village in Velhe taluka. The family was presently staying at Chavannagar in Dhankawadi. “The family had gone to Vihir village on Friday morning for a house warming function of their relative. The accident occurred when they were returning to Pune,” Pawar said. He said the accident spot was not easily accessible. “Along with the local residents, our team members had entered the water to search for the family. Later, the car was towed till the bank with the help of a vehicle. The bodies of the three girls were inside the car,” Pawar said, adding that they had been sent for a post-mortem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/woman-3-daughters-drown-after-car-plunges-into-dam-backwaters/articleshow/81878034.cms||---

But learning from the past experience when they were burdened with surplus stock, the businessmen are not willing to manufacture new kits and are disposing of the old pile first. They say new production will be done only for confirmed orders and on advance payment.Vinod Thapar, president of the Knitwear Club, said, “There is again a demand for PPE suits and masks. For about five months, there was no demand and as a result, city-based manufacturers had stopped making these on account of huge quantity of unsold stock. For the past about a month, Ludhiana industry has been getting orders. But as of now, the industrialists are selling only leftover stocks or taking orders only against full advance payment, as no one wants to struggle with surplus later.” Harish Kairpal, a PPE suit manufacturer and exporter, said, “We are being offered better rates, but due to the bitter experience we had last time we will not manufacture new suits and first sell off the old stock lying in our factories. We are advising all the PPE suit manufacturers to fix a uniform rate so that everyone can get a good business.”Narinder Mittal, general secretary of Ludhiana Business Forums, said, “After the second wave of coronavirus, the demand for masks and PPE suits has increased and a lot of enquiries are being made from all over India. We have adequate quantity available with us to meet these orders and once we exhaust it, we will begin fresh production.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/ppe-suits-masks-in-demand-again-bizmen-want-to-sell-old-stock-first/articleshow/81876394.cms||Mohit Behl

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Contact-tracing hit by lack of manpower, people’s mobility||MUMBAI: Last March, when the Covid-19 outbreak started, contact-tracing was seen as key to stopping the spread of the deadly virus. On April 1 last year, when the first death was reported in Dharavi, the BMC had set up a team of five officials, including doctors, to trace those the 56-year-old victim had met before he tested positive. Over 30 high-risk contacts were traced, moved to institutional quarantine and tested. This April 1, BMC data shows, 27,011 high-risk contacts were traced in the previous 24 hours as the city reported 8,646 cases. Only 980 were sent for institutional quarantine. According to the Centre, 30 contacts must be traced for every positive patient. A year since the outbreak, as the city is buffeted by a second — and bigger — wave of cases, strict contract-tracing has become a challenge and restricting the contacts in institutional or home quarantine is proving very difficult. Officials said with over 8,000 cases a day and the city unlocked and back to business, tracing of high-risk contacts was proving virtually impossible. One major hurdle was manpower: earlier all BMC staff was focused on Covid control, but now civic departments are pushing ahead with infrastructure projects and their own work, while many in health are occupied with the vaccination drive. Another official pointed at Covid fatigue among BMC employees too. The state reminded the districts recently that the Centre has asked to stop contacts from roaming in society and enforce strict containment. The Centre has also questioned the state’s contact-tracing policy. For BMC, the focus now is on testing. “We have increased testing by a huge number. We trace the contacts and test them, so there isn’t a big need to move them to isolation centres. If they’re positive, we move them to CCC2 (institutional care),” said Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner, G-North ward that covers Dadar (W), Mahim and Dharavi. Dighavkar admitted that since there is no lockdown, like in April and May last year, it was a challenge to trace contacts and isolate them. “Last year, there was a strict lockdown, so we only had to trace high risk contacts who were at home. But now people are going to work, travelling, using public transport, so it is virtually impossible to trace all high risk contacts,” he said. During the peak of the first wave in May last year, the BMC had put over 6,000 high-risk contacts in institutional quarantine in Dharavi alone. With Maharashtra proving to be the epicentre of India’s second Covid wave too, the Niti Aayog on Wednesday suggested a five-pronged strategy, including testing and contact-tracing, for it to be able to contain the cases. Last month, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan wrote to Maharashtra chief secretary S J Kunte directing an increase in contact-tracing and suggesting that Maharashtra was not doing it right. “Though it appears high, a deep dive into the methodology of contact tracing revealed that the main concept of contact tracing was not clearly understood by the field level staff, who were mainly listing the immediate family and neighbourhood contacts,” he wrote. “Contact tracing has become a challenge since people are travelling in buses and trains. Our field staff has to rely on what people say about whom they met and came in contact with. This is very tricky and answers people give are unreliable. So we are testing as many high-risk contacts as possible. Our testing numbers are very high,” said Sharad Ughade, assistant municipal commissioner, G-South ward, which covers areas like Worli, Lower Parel and Prabhadevi and saw the city’s first containment zone at Worli Koliwada last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-contact-tracing-hit-by-lack-of-manpower-peoples-mobility/articleshow/81878834.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Nagpur||RFO suicide: Maha asks addl DGP to probe APCCF Reddy||NAGPUR: Maharashtra government has asked additional director general of police Pradnya Sarwade to conduct preliminary inquiry against suspended additional principal chief conservator of forests (APCCF) MS Reddy in connection with suicide of Harisal RFO Deepali Chavan. Chavan had on March 25 shot herself dead with her service pistol charging deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) Vinod Shivkumar with physical, mental, and sexual harassment. Vinod Shivkumar was later suspended and arrested from Nagpur. Following uproar over the RFO’s suicide, the government on March 31 asked Sarwade to probe whether Reddy’s inaction was responsible for Chavan’s death. The top woman cop has been asked to submit report by April 30. Earlier, backing demand by Maharashtra State Gazetted Forest Officers Association, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis had urged CM Uddhav Thackeray to set up a committee headed by woman IPS officer to probe the case. He had also demanded setting up of fast-track court. PCCF (HoFF), G Saiprakash, has already set up a nine-member committee of forest officials to investigate the case. In another development, Amravati MP Navneet Rana has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding dismissal of Vinod Shivkumar from IFS. She also demanded action against Reddy for ignoring complaints against the suspended DyCF, who allegedly used to be drunk on duty many times. Meanwhile, IFS Association, Maharashtra chapter, decided to collect funds to be given as financial assistance to mother of Chavan. In a virtual annual general meeting (AGM) called to discuss the issue, the association condemned Vinod Shivkumar, whose attitude and alleged bad behaviour forced the Harisal RFO to take the extreme step. “The IFS Association will never support such acts and appealed to the cadre to maintain high standards of dignity at the workplace,” said P Kalyan Kumar, honorary secretary of the association. The association plans to collect Rs3,000 per head from members and the entire sum of over Rs5 lakh will be paid to Chavan’s mother, who was dependent on her. The IFS cadre is of 206 officials in Maharashtra.. “On the issue of suspension of Reddy, the association has decided to take a call at appropriate time before appropriate forum,” said Kumar. Sources said, “Senior officials had divergent views on the suspension of Reddy. They felt it was improper to suspend a senior IFS officer without preliminary inquiry.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rfo-suicide-maha-asks-addl-dgp-to-probe-apccf-reddy/articleshow/81878033.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Pune||Malls, cinemas & religious places in Pune district shut for 7 days||PUNE: Stringent restrictions such as a 6pm-to-6am bar on travel, no dine-in at restaurants, closure of bars and ban on weekly markets or the assembly of more than five people even during the daytime will come into force from Saturday for seven days across Pune district to check the rise in Covid-19 cases. All religious places will also be shut till next Friday, an order issued by the civic body said. The district administration on Friday decided against a lockdown but announced these restrictions while excluding essential services from their ambit. Food delivery from eateries will be allowed till 11pm. Lodging facilities for guests at hotels can continue in Pune, but their restaurant services would not be allowed for outsiders, Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar said. In-room dining and takeaway services will be permitted. The authorities said a review of the restrictions will follow after seven days. The announcement, particularly the night travel restriction, set off concern among citizens about undue harassment and excesses by the police. Pune MP Girish Bapat said, “The police, while enforcing the restrictions, should not beat up citizens. Their deterrence should be enough but people should not feel terrorised.” Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta said all their officers and constabulary have been instructed to strictly adopt a humane approach and understand people and their problems during the enforcement. “Our intent is not to harass the public. Rather, we will sensitise people to follow the state’s directives,” he said. Industrial bodies like the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture and CII were also worried about the impact of the restrictions on their supplies. Their representatives said stopping PMPML bus services would affect their workforce. Affected office-goers in IT parks and BPOs were also uneasy about the travel curbs. Upset owners of restaurants, bars and eateries have planned a protest on Saturday. They said the seven-day closure would badly impact their business and set of a mass exodus of their staff. Multiplex bodies feared disruption of new film releases in Pune while owners of shops in malls said another setback at a time when they were recovering would stall any progress.Speaking to reporters after a Covid-19 review meeting on Friday, chaired by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said the stringent measures were imposed after observing the rise in the district’s positivity rate. The rate is the percentage of individuals testing positive from those tested for Covid-19. “It has risen in the range of 27% to 32% (from 26.7% on March 31) and the cases have also gone up. Last week, there were about 6,000 cases per day which have now increased to 8,000 per day. Health experts have said it may go up to 9,000 cases per day in the coming weeks. This needs micro-planning, ramping up testing and other measures,” he said. Rao said they want to achieve a golden mean by ensuring stricter restrictions with fewer hassles, through stricter vigilance in the micro-containment zones and monitoring of home isolation cases, and a greater focus on testing, particularly of the superspreaders. Private offices can function with up to 50% staff who can travel by showing valid I-cards. Rao said they did not want crowding even during the daytime and hence the restriction on the assembly of more than five people even during the day. Joint commissioner of police Ravindra Shisve said, “There will be several check posts where the purpose of travel during the restricted hours will be assessed. During the daytime too, we will enforce the ban on assembly of more than five persons. Industries will have to make their own vehicle arrangements for ferrying people to and from their workplace.” Hospitals Told To Ramp Up Beds Rao said private hospitals were directed to increase the beds to the highest level as was done last October. “We may have to convert some hospitals into dedicated Covid centres. We are going to increase beds at the Sassoon General Hospital and are activating the jumbo Covid hospitals too. Vacant posts at these medical facilities are being filled up,” he added. Five deputy collectors will keep a watch on hospitals and auditing of bills will start, Rao said. Cases were on the rise in Sangli, Satara, Kolhapur and Solapur in Pne division, he said. “As of now patients from other districts coming to Pune for treatment has not started, but if it does, the health infrastructure here would be under huge pressure,” he added. Dos and Don’ts From PMC, PCMC The municipal commissioners of Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad also issued guidelines for the new restrictions. “The orders are in accordance with the Disaster Management Act 2005 and the Epidemic Disease Act 1897,” Pune’s civic chief Vikram Kumar said. Lodging facilities for guests at hotels can continue in Pune, but their restaurants services would not be allowed. In-room dining and parcel services were permitted, he added. Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil said, “We will step up the vaccination drive and the current curbs will not affect it,” he added.

Vinod Yadav, the 28-year-old accused, told Wadala RPF officials that he was involved in this illegal trade for the past year and half as it was a “lucrative side business”. A Commerce graduate, Yadav holds a diploma in international business. He had been using as many as 16 user IDs for booking tickets and usually made tatkal bookings. Initially, he would book tickets for his neighbours. As word spread, he began to book tickets for more individuals against a commission of around Rs 200 per ticket. The Wadala RPF were tipped off by the railways’ information technology cell that had managed to track down one among the 16 User IDs that Yadav used. “After we got hold of Yadav’s location in Chunabhatti, our team picked him up. Twenty nine tickets of future journeys, valued at over Rs 1 lakh, were seized from him and blocked,” said SI D H Patil of Wadala GRP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ticketing-scam-busted-rpf-nabs-28-yr-old-company-exec/articleshow/81878899.cms||---
---||Nagpur||CBI releases all suspects, mum on Nimgade murder case||NAGPUR: A controversy has erupted as the prime suspects rounded up by city police in the contract killing of 72-year-old Eknath Nimgade are all roaming scot-free now. The cops had handed over these suspects to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which did not reply to messages from TOI for comments on the case. The CBI had not said anything on the Nimgade murder case of 2016 even after the city police last month claimed to have got ‘sufficient links’ to prove these 14 suspects had ganged up to eliminate the 72-year-old architect for a ‘supari’ of Rs5 crore. Police had handed over nine suspects to CBI around a fortnight ago but the central investigating agency seems to have released them all. Kamptee-based don Ranjeet Safelkar, also projected as mastermind in Nimgade murder case by city police, was also arrested recently. But his arrest was in the Manish Shriwas murder case of 2012, which is being probed by Nagpur crime branch under CP Amitesh Kumar. The CBI had been handed over the Nimgade murder probe barely a month-and-a-half after the incident, on orders by the high court in 2016. The CBI made no headway in the probe, and quietly filed a closure report before the court in December 2020. In March 2021, city police claimed to have unearthed the plot and nabbed an inter-state gang who were behind the crime. Sources said most of the suspects rounded up by city police then are now accusing the city cops of harassment. As evidence, they are the citing CBI’s action of releasing them, as it is not taking seriously the conspiracy theory projected by Kumar. CP Kumar had said his crime branch team had more than sufficient links and strong evidence to believe that the suspects were engaged in gunning down Nimgade after conducting recce for the murder. The city police had also claimed that around Rs1.25 crore, out of Rs5 crore of the total deal, too had already exchanged hands to hire the assailants. Kumar had also named the suspects and spelt out their roles publicly in a press meet stating how the murder was conceived, planned and executed by the gang when the victim was returning home. Three of he suspects had allegedly fired on Nimgade. “City police had done it’s job after sufficient evidence was collected regarding the suspects, who were handed over to the CBI. Now, it’s up to the CBI what they do with the suspects,” said Kumar. He said city police had duly informed CBI regarding the murder plot and the suspects. He refrained from commenting as to why there were no arrests by the central agency. Nimgade’s son Anupam had earlier claimed in the FIR that his father’s assailants were hired by builder-politician lobby over a 5.57 acre land on Wardha Road, which is worth around Rs180 crore as on date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cbi-releases-all-suspects-mum-on-nimgade-murder-case/articleshow/81878041.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Dehradun||Take affiliation from Sri Dev Suman Uttarakhand University to keep receiving grant: Higher Education Dept to state-aided colleges||Dehradun: The Uttarakhand higher education department has asked the officials of state colleges — currently affiliated with Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University, a central university — to procure affiliation from Sri Dev Suman Uttarakhand University in order to continue receiving the grant provided by the state. The department has stated that though the grant was released for this financial year, only the colleges affiliated with Sri Dev Suman Uttarakhand University will be given the grant from the next financial year. The state-aided colleges have also been directed to pay security money — equivalent to what they have paid for their affiliation with the HNBGU — to the higher education department. Notably, there are 18 government-aided colleges running in the state and most of them have carried out protests against this move in the past. The staff members of these colleges claim that it is unfair on the part of the government to ask them to change their affiliation. Meanwhile, Dhan Singh Rawat, state higher education minister, has said that the state has released the salaries of the staff employed in the three government-aided colleges for the month of December. Their salaries were pending due to an ongoing department investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/take-affiliation-from-sri-dev-suman-uttarakhand-university-to-keep-receiving-grant-higher-education-dept-to-state-aided-colleges/articleshow/81876405.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Lucknow||Virus snuffs out 9 lives, bugs 940 more people in 24 hours||Lucknow: The Covid-19 not only continued to grow exponentially in the city, but it also turned deadlier on Friday with 940 new infections and nine deaths in the past 24 hours. This was the biggest spike in daily tally in almost six months and toll in four months. It also accounted for 31% and 56% of the total cases and casualties, respectively, in the state. The nine casualties included two men in their mid-30s. Experts warned that the high transmission rate being witnessed will result in more deaths as data shows that 5% of those infected get critically ill and 1-2% die. As only 252 patients recovered on Friday, far less than the new infections, the number of patients with active infection mounted to 4,587 — highest in five months. Of these, 3,011 were in home isolation and the remaining in hospitals. The city’s tally is now at 87,753. The casualties on Friday included three at KGMU and one each in two private hospitals in Gomtinagar. All the patients were critically ill when brought to the hospitals. “Two patients in their 30s and an elderly who died in KGMU were admitted with low oxygen levels and had heart issues. They died due to respiratory failure triggered by double pneumonia,” said KGMU spokesperson Dr Sudhir Singh . “The two — a man (63) and a woman (78) — who also died due to respiratory failure in the private hospitals — were hypertensive and diabetic,” said a senior health officer. Indiranagar worst hit: Indiranagar was the worst hit, with 61 cases in the past 24 hours, closely followed by Gomtinagar where 58 residents contracted the virus. Other areas that witnessed high incidence included Talkatora with 51 new infections, Chowk 48, Hazratganj 45, Mahanagar 43, Alambagh 35, Rae Bareli Road 32, Hasanganj 29, Aliganj 23 and Bazaarkhala 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/virus-snuffs-out-9-lives-bugs-940-more-people-in-24-hours/articleshow/81878845.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Patna||Bihar CM launches BHY scheme for children with heart ailments||PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar Friday launched the Bal Hriday Yojana (BHY), which will provide free treatment to children suffering from the medical condition of a hole in the heart or ventricular septal defect. The CM flagged off a bus carrying 21 children with this condition, along with their guardians, to the Patna airport to be flown to Ahmedabad (Gujarat) for specialized treatment. They would be given additional specialized medical treatment at the Ahmedabad-based hospital run by the Prashanti Medical Services and Research Foundation with which the state government has an agreement so that free medical treatment and care could be given to these children. The BHY function was held outside the Samvad at the CM Secretariat in the presence of education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary, health minister Pandey, CM’s principal secretary Deepak Kumar, health department principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit, and other senior officials. Talking to media persons after meeting the 21 children and their guardians and also wished them successful treatment, the CM said other states have also entered a similar agreement with the Ahmedabad hospital for specialized medical treatment. He also said the BHY was discussed and conceived last year and then was linked with the government’s Saat Nishchay – 2 programmes, which also got the cabinet clearance after the formation of the new government following the assembly election. The scheme started on Thursday, but it was launched on Friday, the CM also said, adding additional medical treatment is provided to the children afflicted with heart-related ailments. Earlier, the diagnosis of the 21 children suffering from a hole in their hearts was done at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology (IGIC) and Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) here, following which the doctors from PMSRF hospital at Ahmedabad arrived and also examined them. The CM said that the government will bear the entire travel expenditure of the 21 children and their guardians, besides the money spent on their treatment, as BHY provides free additional medical and health care to the children afflicted with heart-related ailments. He added that the government would see that a similar arrangement is put in place at Patna in the future. Besides, when the 21 children return after treatment, health minister Mangal Pandey and the health department officials will present the details. About the mysterious disease that has surfaced in Nawada, the CM said that a team of doctors and experts has been sent there to do an investigation into all possible aspects of the mysterious disease.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-launches-bhy-scheme-for-children-with-heart-ailments/articleshow/81877263.cms||Abhay Singh

The decision was part of the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina. Bangabandhu or “Friend of Bengal” is the name given to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman— Bangladesh’s Father of the nation. Speaking to TOI, DU acting vice-chancellor PC Joshi said, “This chair has been established as part of the 50 years of Bangladesh. The PM went to Dhaka and it was decided that a chair will be established at DU, as it is a premier institute and will be on Bangladesh studies.” Joshi said there would be teachers of anthropology, political science, sociology, economics or any subject. “The university will set a criteria and teacher of the chair will be decided through that. This chair will be hosted by Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR).” The VC hoped that with the chair, students from Bangladesh would be encouraged to come and study at DU. “We anyway have a lot of students from there. With a few fellowships provided to the international students, their numbers can go up.” During admissions in 2020, 21 Bangladeshi students joined DU, making it the fifth biggest contingent of foreign students. Joshi said, with the chair, “ties between India and Bangladesh will also be strengthened.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-to-set-up-bangabandhu-chair-to-promote-ties-with-neighbouring-country/articleshow/81878842.cms||---

Sabharwal said it has been witnessed that within the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation and police commissionerate there were several unapproved, unplanned and illegal speed breakers that could be dangerous and cause major accidents as sudden braking increases risk of vehicles colliding. The petitioner stated that the Indian Road Congress had issued “Guidelines for traffic calming measures in urban and rural areas” that provide specific standards for speed bumps. “Besides, not all speed breakers are painted with black and white strips to make them visible to commuters and warning signboards to tell people about the speed bumps are also not displayed,” he said, adding that he had sent a representation to the ADGP (traffic) and Ludhiana CP too, but no action was taken. “It is the responsibility of the MC and Ludhiana CP to get the wrongly built speed breakers removed,” he said. After the high court issued the notice of motion, the assistant advocate general, Punjab, accepted it on the behalf of the state and the ADGP (traffic) and asked for time to file the reply. Accident due to speed bumpOn June 30 last, some youngsters suffered injuries when their speeding car crashed into a tree in Sarabha Nagar outside the house of MLA Kuldeep Singh Vaid around 6.15am. The accident was captured on the CCTV camera installed near the spot. It showed that the car had lost balance over a speed breaker and crashed into the tree. Road safety expert Kamaljit Soi said, “That speed breaker was not made as per the specifications of the Indian Road Congress. I had visited the spot and then verified that the speed breaker was not as per the ideal dimensions. Besides, there was no cautionary board, warning a vehicle driver about it. Ideally, there has to be a board 50 metres ahead. Then, the speed breaker has to be painted well to be visible. The rumble strips speed breakers are less damaging, so they should be preferred.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/hc-notice-to-top-brass-over-wrongly-built-speed-bumps/articleshow/81876398.cms||Payal Dhawan
---||Delhi||At higher education meet, DU teachers bat for autonomy||New Delhi: City colleges are adamant that the autonomy of Delhi University should not be compromised under the new National Education Policy. Such views elicited from the constituent colleges were discussed by the university at a meeting on Friday on the Higher Education Commission of India (HECI), the body that is slated to replace the University Grants Commission. The university had divided all its colleges into five clusters and their views on NEP and HECI collated. The deans and directors of all DU faculties and centres were also instructed to hold meetings with staff and send their feedback. These were shared at the April 1 meeting chaired by acting vice-chancellor PC Joshi and attended by Pankaj Arora, director, Institute of Lifelong Learning, the coordinator between the academic and research departments and the administrative units of DU. Speaking to TOI, Arora said, “We asked the colleges and departments on March 23 to send us structured responses after organising them into five clusters, realising that each college wouldn’t be able to hold a meeting.” He said the responses included teachers’ concerns for the society at large, for students from the marginal sections, and the need to maintain the autonomy of the university in curriculum creation after HECI came up. Arora added, “DU will discuss these suggestions on April 6 and we will invite institutions in the National Capital Region for the meeting.” The feedback of a college cluster accessed by TOI included teachers’ anxiety about the NEP suggestion on the establishment of a Board of Governors (BOG) to frame all the regulations and vested with absolute power to appoint, promote, demote and remove institutional employees. The feedback said, “This could lead to huge job uncertainty as BOGs would be empowered to govern the institutions free of external interference superseding all existing legislations.” The teachers suggested that BOG should also “have elected representatives from teaching and non-teaching staff along with other individuals from different walks of life”, similar to DU’s Academic Council and Executive Council. The teachers also felt there should be “a forum above BOG where grievances of the staff and students may be addressed”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/at-higher-education-meet-du-teachers-bat-for-autonomy/articleshow/81878868.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

---||Mumbai||3 luxury apartments sealed in Mumbai||MUMBAI: The pandemic has spread to some of the poshest residential skyscrapers in south Mumbai, locking up families in their luxury apartments even as residents complained about the ‘arbitrary’ sealing of entire buildings by the BMC. In tony Cuffe Parade, the 25-storey A-wing of Jolly Maker-1, comprising about 100 luxury flats, and Maker Tower-B were sealed by the A ward office on Friday. At Nepean Sea Road, Embassy Apartments was sealed on Tuesday after 23 cases were reported. “We are following the Covid protocol to seal the entire wing,” said a BMC official. BMC protocol calls for sealing entire building with five or more cases. If there are fewer cases, the floor is sealed. A Jolly Maker-1 resident told TOI: “The BMC pasted a notice at the entrance notifying six Covid cases, but there is no one monitoring if anyone is coming in or going out.” Jolly Maker-1 is often touted as the richest housing society in India because of its huge corpus running into tens of crores. It is home to several corporate honchos and businessmen. After sealing Maker Tower-B, BMC officials took RT-PCR tests of all high-risk contacts. Local corporator Harshita Narwekar said, “This is being done so that residents do not need to go through the 14-day quarantine. Only the floors can be sealed in case it is found that there are no more positive cases.” She admitted that in large societies it is impractical to lock up all residents as many have domestic help living with them. Amit Shah, a resident, said only flats with positive patients should be sealed, and not all 150 flats. The 12-storey Embassy Apartments was sealed after 23 cases were reported in the past seven days. “Residents panicked when they saw a domestic help who had tested positive in the compound. A driver had also tested positive,” said a resident. Complaining about the ‘arbitrary’ sealing of entire buildings, many residents alleged that some towers, including a luxury complex in central Mumbai, have not been sealed despite having more than five cases. But civic officials said they do not seal buildings if they find the society members are strictly following Covid-appropriate behavior. “We only seal the floors, even if they have more than five cases,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/3-luxury-apartments-sealed-in-mumbai/articleshow/81878884.cms||Richa Pinto

The family was going to Berhna under Barh police station area from Sikandarpur under Bihta police station area in western Patna. The deceased were identified as Amresh Kumar (30), Khushbu Devi (25) and Aradhya (5). One of their relatives, Pallav Kumar, told the police that Amresh was going to meet his sister at Berhna as she had been diagnosed with cancer. “He was scheduled to take a break at Achuwara village in Barh to meet my family before going to see his brother-in-law Anshu Singh at Berhna,” he said. Pallav also told the police that Amresh owned at least five trucks. Salimpur police station SHO Sanjay Kumar said the SUV in which they were travelling was reportedly at a high speed. “There was a turning near the accident spot and he might have lost balance,” the SHO said. “The vehicle flew off the road and fell into a field after overturning several times.

---||Nagpur||Govt changes fire blower buying diktat which favoured one firm||NAGPUR: In a big blow to former forest minister Sanjay Rathod, the state forest ministry has revised specifications of fire blowers which benefitted only one company while procuring them. The forest department purchases blowers worth Rs 70 lakh to Rs 1 crore annually in all the territorial and wildlife divisions. At the insistence of the forest minister, on December 8, the state government granted permission to technical specifications for forest fire blowers. On December 18, APCCF (protection) issued orders to state officials to follow the same specifications while procuring fire blowers. One of the conditions that the machine should have a blowing force of 38 newtons went in favour of only one company Husqvarna. Only Husqvarna blowers, which are two-stroke, fitted this condition. A complaint was also lodged with forest secretary Milind Mhaiskar on December 11 last year by other firms but as the orders were from the top, the complaints were not addressed. On December 24, 2020, TOI reported how the specification order was flawed and surprising as this was for the first time the state specified standards for fire blowers. The same yardsticks were not followed while procuring vehicles, computers and peripherals, nursery equipment etc. However, on March 25, 2021, the state forest ministry took note of the issue and changed the specification by removing the condition that the machine should have a blowing force of 38 newtons. APCCF (protection) Sanjeev Gaur has written to all the forest officials in the state about the fresh decision. “It is a good move that will curb malpractices. Now other players in the field can also participate in the tendering process. Due to this stringent condition, even as we were part of the process. We did not qualify despite our product being four-stroke and less fuel consuming,” said one of the executives of Stihl, which supplies German-make fire blowers. Another firm executive said, “Earlier there was no such condition by the forest department that flowing force should be 38 newtons. Till last year fire blower machines were procured for Rs 50,000 per piece. By changing the specification, the same blowers are now purchased for Rs 60,000, even as other firms have quoted a much low price. This is a waste of public money.” Forest officials also admit that “The German-make machines Stihl though have a blowing force of 30 newtons, its velocity is 116 metres per second, which is more than the Husqvarna. While working in the field, velocity matters most than force and hence four-stroke machines are better placed than the two-stroke costly machines.” A Stihl official told TOI, “We have been supplying machines with the flowing force of 30 newtons and all these machines are working successfully. In trials too, it has been found that our machines save 25-30% fuel. When four-stroke machines are available, why should two-stroke machines be considered for a higher cost? Two-stroke blowers will pollute more and also consume more fuel. These blowers have also become outdated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/govt-changes-fire-blower-buying-diktat-which-favoured-one-firm/articleshow/81878043.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Chandigarh||HSGMC: Rebels’ no-trust move against Daduwal||Chandigarh: All is not well in the Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (HSGMC) as a group headed by Didar Singh Nalwi is out in the open against president Baljit Singh Daduwal. HSGMC has also sent a letter to its Barar-based member Jasbir Singh Khalsa to return Rs one lakh that he allegedly withdrew from the golak in April 2017 by violating rules. The dispute came to the fore earlier this week, when 15 committee members attended a meeting convened by the Nalvi group and passed a no-confidence resolution against Daduwal. “Though he has been elected president, he did not complete the procedures. He had to appear before the general body, which had to constitute the executive committee. They have not yet passed the budget or called the general body,’’ alleged Nalvi. Daduwal dismissed the allegations, saying, “Nalvi ji was among those who voted for us during the election in August last year. Everything is documented about the 41-member committee and 11-member general committee. We have started the audit of collection and works since 2013, which is troubling some.’’ “As for recovery notices, according to rules, nobody can use golak money for personal use or individual deras. They can simply recommend, that too for gurdwaras. So, we have served notices. One person has already deposited the money while another is being served another notice,” he added. Khalsa has been given 15 days’ time to deposit the amount, failing which action would be taken against him. Sources said in his letter to Khalsa, who has been managing a gurdwara, established in the name of Sahibzadas of Guru Gobind Singh, at Barara in Ambala district, for about 30 years, HSGMC secretary Sarabjeet Singh wrote: “No member has the right to take ‘help’ for personal benefits or personal home dera... For your personal dera, you have taken help ‘in written’, of Rs 1 lakh from the Guru’s golak on April 8, 2017, which is illegal. The meeting of HSGMC executive committee held in this regard on April 5, 2017, in which the said amount was sanctioned, is also illegal as it was attended by only five members....decision on such financial issue can be taken by minimum seven members. Five members of executive committee cannot even hold such a meeting.” Khalsa said he would not deposit the money. “I received only Rs 2 lakh from the HSGMC funds — Rs 1 lakh for helping a Dharmi Fauji and Rs 1 lakh for celebrating 550th Parkash Purb of Guru Nanak Dev Ji. We have submitted all the bills at the committee office. I am not going to deposit any money sought by the HSGMC secretary,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hsgmc-rebels-no-trust-move-against-daduwal/articleshow/81878047.cms||Manvir Saini
---||Delhi||IIT-D keeps promise, reduces its carbon footprint by over 50%||New Delhi: Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi has become the first central government-funded technical institute to reduce its carbon footprint by more than 50%. The institute claimed this after its bilateral power purchase contract with a hydro power generator in Himachal Pradesh for 2 MW. In a statement, the institute said that “the open access provisions in Electricity Act 2003 have made it possible to buy power from the generators of their choice through bilateral contracts or energy exchange, for large consumers of power like IIT Delhi. We made use of these provisions by involving PTC India Ltd as a trader to identify a source of ‘green’ power. Buying 2 MW of power exclusively from ‘green’ generator is equivalent to off-setting about 14,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.” The institute informed that they already have 2.7 MWp (Megawatts-peak) of rooftop solar PV installation and with the addition of 2 MW of hydro power, IIT Delhi’s power purchase portfolio has 4.7 MW of green power as against contract demand of around 8.5 MW with the local utility that essentially serves academic and hostel areas. “With this, IIT Delhi shares its responsibility in achieving the nationally determined contribution target as part of climate change pledge by the Government of India during the Paris agreement,” the institute said in its statement. Speaking on this, V Ramgopal Rao, director of IIT Delhi, said that “availing green power through open access is another important initiative that we have taken in recent times to share our responsibility towards clean climate. IIT Delhi has always shown a pathway and provided leadership for new initiatives like these. Through many such proactive actions, we are making a good progress in achieving the target of making our campus smart, sustainable and green. The institute has plans to expand the green power purchase portfolio in the near future.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/iit-d-keeps-promise-reduces-its-carbon-footprint-by-over-50/articleshow/81878901.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: M K Stalin sees plot by PM as I-T raids daughter & son-in-law||CHENNAI: Four days before the assembly election in Tamil Nadu, income tax officials on Friday conducted searches at the homes of DMK president M K Stalin’s daughter and son-in-law in Chennai and the party’s Karur candidate Senthil Balaji in Aravakurichi, triggering criticism from opposition leaders across the country and a complaint to the Election Commission of India. Stalin responded with a show of political valour. “I am the son of Kalaignar. I will not be scared by such raids. I have faced MISA (Maintenance of Internal Security Act) and Emergency. They can scare the AIADMK with such raids, but not the DMK,” he said. Accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of instigating the raids, Stalin said, “The people will reply to your act on April 6”. Stalin’s son Udhayanidhi dared I-T officials to raid him. “Raiding the opposition is the BJP’s coping mechanism when facing electoral defeat,” tweeted Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. “IT raids on Stalin ji’s son-in-law is yet another example of GOI hounding political opponents through their trusted agencies,” Mehbooba Mufti tweeted. Searches were carried out on premises in Teynampet and Neelankarai, owned by Stalin’s daughter Senthamarai and her husband Sabareesan. Searches were also conducted at the Anna Nagar residence of DMK IT wing functionary Karthik Mohan, son of sitting Anna Nagar MLA and DMK’s candidate in the same constituency this election, M K Mohan. I-T officials also searched the residence of G Square Bala, who faced similar action ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Searches were also carried out at premises owned by DMK MLA V Senthil Balaji in Aravakurichi and those of his associates in Karur, Coimbatore and a few other places. Officials searched Balaji’s house in Rameswarapatti village as also that of his brother Ashok at Ramakrishnapuram in Karur. They also searched the premises of DMK town secretary Darani Saravanan and his friend Mani in Karur. In a statement, the income tax department said the Chennai Directorate of Income Tax conducted searches on three different groups and a few individuals in Tamil Nadu. These groups and individuals are involved in businesses ranging from distilleries and breweries, real estate, local financing and handling cash of politically exposed persons for the ongoing elections, it said. IT officials went back disappointed, said DMK Oganization secretary R S Bharathi "The IT officials found ₹1.36 lakh cash in Senthamarai's residence, which was kept for household expenses. They gave it back to her and left. Thank you Modi for conducting this raid," Bharathi told reporters late on Friday. "In the residence of Senthil Balaji they found only ₹8,000 in cash. In the residence of DMK Anna Nagar MLA M K Mohan, they found ₹2 lakh in cash. He had drawn ₹4 lakh cash from bank and had spent ₹2 lakh as election expenditure. The officials gave back that cash and returned disappointed," Bharathi said. While DMK general secretary S Durai Murugan said the searches were being done with a “political objective”, DMK allies including TNCC president K S Alagiri, CPM state secretary K Balakrishnan and VCK chief Thol Thirumavalavan hit out at the BJP for targeting the DMK ahead of the assembly poll. DMK complained to the Election Commission of India against the IT searches just days ahead of the polls. “The IT department has been used as a sword and as a pawn in the hands of the ruling BJP party,” it said in the complaint, while charging the IT officials with abusing their powers under the garb of discharging their official duties.

---||Chandigarh||‘Punjab prison rules allow use of private vehicle if prisoner wants’||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab prisons department has clarified that the Uttar Pradesh registration number ambulance used to transport jailed gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari from Ropar jail to Mohali court is owned by him but it is not bullet-proof. It also clarified that the Punjab prisons rules allow use of private conveyance. The mystery over the ambulance used on Wednesday to ferry Ansari from Ropar jail to Mohali court turned murkier after UP minister and government spokesperson Siddharth Nath Singh on Thursday said it is bullet-proof and owned by Ansari. He had also questioned the role of the Punjab government in the entire issue, saying: “A thorough probe will be conducted to find out how an ambulance is being used as a private vehicle by Mukhtar Ansari. It is a bullet-proof luxury vehicle.” Praveen Kumar Sinha, ADGP (prisons) Punjab, told TOI, “This ambulance was provided by Mukhtar Ansari. But it is not a bullet proof ambulance but a regular one.” The senior IPS officer further clarified that the jails department hands over the prisoner to the police party which takes the prisoner to the court. Police party has to take the prisoner to the court as per the Punjab Prisoners (Attendance in Courts) Rules, 1969 under the parent Act of 1952. “There is a provision in these rules that the police party can allow a separate conveyance if a prisoner wants,” he added. Sinha, however, said there is also a precedent as various courts in UP had earlier allowed Ansari to use a separate private conveyance. “Everyone knows Ansari’s medical condition and there are medical reports from the PGIMER, Chandigarh, about his health condition,” he said, adding that the Punjab prisons rules provide for the option of private conveyance in such an eventuality. Asked when the Ropar central jail is likely to hand over Ansari to the UP government in compliance with the Supreme Court orders, Sinha said that the legal evaluation process is in progress. “How to implement the court’s order is the question and we are looking for legal guidance on that account,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pb-prison-rules-allow-use-of-pvt-vehicle-if-prisoner-wants/articleshow/81878046.cms||Sanjeev Verma

Doctors clear doubts||LUCKNOW: Even as Covid-19 vaccination has seen steady response, there is still confusion among the public when it comes to comorbid conditions and vaccination. TOI collected all these doubts and spoke to field experts about the response of the vaccine in patients with autoimmune diseases, those with kidney issues and patients of hypertension and diabetes. Asked if kidney patients could go for vaccination, head of SGPGI’s microbiology department Prof Ujjala Ghoshal replied, “The vaccine does not impact the kidneys so it is safe. However, if the person has undergone a kidney transplant, then certain complications can occur.” “Covid vaccine creates an immune response which can trigger a relapse in nephrotic syndrome patients. For such patients, monitoring urine routine and symptoms regularly for a few days after vaccination should be a priority,” she explained. Prof Ghoshal further added that in case a transplant patient is to be vaccinated, an mRNA (messenger RNA) vaccine which is completely synthetically manufactured, should be given. “These vaccines can be given to immunocompromised patients, but the current two vaccines in India are not mRNA vaccines,” she said. Another doubt in people’s minds is about patients with compromised immunity. “Immunocompromised persons can be vaccinated but vaccine response will be reduced in these persons. There will be no harm in getting vaccinated. It will provide some immunity against the virus, but how much is not known yet,” said head of KGMU’s microbiology department Prof Amita Jain. These include cancer patients, or patients on immunosuppressant medication. Hypertensive patients and those with diabetes should also monitor their health post-vaccination. “There is nothing special diabetic and hypetensive patients have to keep in mind for the vaccine though,” said Prof Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/is-vaccine-safe-for-you-doctors-clear-doubts/articleshow/81878897.cms||Yusra Husain

The company has a bank account in a government bank’s branch in Narhi, Hazratganj. The illegal transactions were made at Wednesday midnight. Owner of the company Somnath Chatterjee, a resident of LDA Colony, said he got a message of money deduction on his mobile phone. “I did not get any OTP or email as I usually do at the time of such transactions,” said the victim. “It is suspected that Somanth’s email account linked with the bank account was hacked and money was withdrawn illegally,” said SP cyber cell Triveni Singh. Singh said that a case with the cyber police station under charges of dishonesty, and IT Act has been registered and probe is underway. Singh also said that cyber criminals have launched a new type of fraud. “Without sharing OTP, or asking details of your card, a message is sent to the account holder on the phone that their balance has become zero. The hacker then offers to return the money, for which they send a link. On clicking that link, the thieves take away money from the account,” he added. Singh further said that in another attack, cyber criminals using malware get hold of an internet banking account and call the customer saying that a specific amount has been debited for a fixed deposit. To reverse this transaction, the ‘customer’ is asked for a password. Thereafter, this generated password is used by the hackers to transfer cash to their account.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bizman-loses-rs-52l-to-cybercrime-cops-say-email-hacked/articleshow/81878936.cms||---

Expressing satisfaction over the performance of STF, the minister also gave in-principle approval to provide the force new modern vehicles, latest technology equipment and software. In the meeting attended by senior police officers, it was informed that Haryana assembly had passed a stringent Haryana Control of Organised Crime (HRCOC) Bill to check organised crime in the state. The same had been sent to the Union government for the Presidential assent. It would be implemented in the entire state as soon as it is approved. Giving clear instructions to the police officers, he asked them to take immediate action against criminals and those disturbing law and order and be cordial and sensitive towards the public which believe in peace. Vij said criminals and law violators should have police fear, while the public should have faith in the police. The fear of the police among criminals will increase only when the police will increase their efficiency and enhance their social interaction with the public, he added. He also reviewed cases of theft, burglary and vehicle thefts, which were cracked successfully. He also directed officials to solve all pending cases to give relief to the general public. With the help of public, police can curb criminal activities to a great extent, the minister added. Earlier, Haryana DGP Manoj Yadava briefed about the activities and achievements of Haryana Police.

---||Chandigarh||‘Decide on gradation certificate to Oly shooter in a month’||Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court has given one month to the Haryana government to decide on issuing the sports gradation certificate to two-time Olympian shooter Sanjeev Rajput. The HC has passed these orders after hearing Rajput’s plea that he has not been issued the sports gradation certificate despite his application being pending since December 2018 while another sportsperson Vishwajeet Singh, the son of then director of sports department Haryana, was issued the same certificate within a week. According to Rajput, who has a sixth world ranking in rifle shooting and is ranked first in India, the certificate would make him eligible for consideration in the recruitment process for Haryana Civil Services (executive branch) and allied services in 2021 under the eligible sportsperson (ESP) category. Rajput, who belongs to Yamunanagar district of Haryana, and is an Arjuna Awardee, had also claimed before the HC that because of the non-issuance of sports gradation on time by the state, he could not apply under the ESP category in 2018 for HCS (executive branch) recruitment. "Not only this, it was common knowledge that the sports department was not issuing adequate gradation certificates... in the said 2018 recruitment," his counsel had argued. His counsel also submitted that in 2021, fresh vacancies have been advertised for the HCS (executive branch), wherein five posts are reserved for the ESP category. However, till date no gradation has been issued by the department of sports, Haryana, and the petitioner faces imminent threat of disqualification for no fault of his. After hearing the contentions of Rajput and prima facie finding it a fit case, considering Rajput’s achievements in the international sports, Justice Alka Sarin of the HC has directed the Haryana government to take a decision on his plea for issuing the sports gradation certificate within a month. Under the 2018 sports policy of Haryana government, exceptional sportspersons were entitled to seek sports gradation certificates to avail the benefit of ESP category in public recruitments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/decide-on-gradation-certificate-to-oly-shooter-in-a-month/articleshow/81878050.cms||Ajay Sura

The court of judicial magistrate 1st Class (JMIC) Amit Bakshi said the Supreme Court has already considered Ansari’s plea regarding his medical condition. Wanted in Uttar Pradesh for several cases, Ansari was produced before the Mohali court in a wheelchair on Wednesday in connection with an alleged 2019 extortion matter. His counsel Raj Sumer Singh told the court that the accused suffered medical emergency on March 29 and has been facing acute chest pain. He said Ansari has previous medical condition and has suffered two major heart attacks and it is feared that if the applicant is denied proper medical assistance, he might succumb to his medical ailments. His counsel also sought a reply from the Rupnagar jail superintendent before deciding the application. The court observed: ‘No reply on behalf of the jail superintendent would be required as the jail superintendent is duty bound as per law to provide appropriate medical facility to the accused as per his medical condition (if any), as per the jail manual and also to comply with the March 26 order of the apex court.” The court also directed that as Ansari is in judicial custody in the present case, the jail superintendent, at the time of transferring the accused’s custody to UP as per directions of the apex court, will mention that he be produced through video conferencing on April 12 in the present case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-court-rejects-plea-for-med-board/articleshow/81878054.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

Mumbai’s Friday figure of 8,844 was over thrice its first wave peak of 2,848 on October 7. Friday’s figures for Maharashtra and the city are all-time Covid highs for both, with the state coming close to the 50,000 daily detection mark. For the second day in a row, the state added over 200 deaths -- 202. Maharashtra’s overall toll is 55,379, though the state’s cumulative death rate has dropped below 2% (1.91%) with the second wave witnessing fewer deaths despite a rise in cases. CM Uddhav Thackeray said that the rise in cases in the state is worrisome. “People became complacent in the last few months when the cases were low. The manner in which beds in the hospitals are filling up is concerning,” said Thackeray. Members of the state Covid taskforce have said that even if people are asymptomatic and home quarantined, they should stay in touch with a doctor. “They should continue to take 6-minute walk tests at home. If the oxygen saturation comes under 93%, people shouldn’t waste a minute and get hospitalised,” said intensivist Dr Rahul Pandit, also a taskforce member. A third of the state’s cases came from MMR (15,321). Thane city recorded 1,370 fresh cases on Friday while three deaths were reported, taking the virus’s toll to 1,398. In a sign of late hospitalisations, dean of Nesco Jumbo Hospital in Goregaon, Dr Neelam Andrade, said they have encountered two cases where one woman died in the triage area before they could start treatment and another died on the way to the centre. “People must stay watchful and in touch with a medical professional,” she said. A third of the state’s cases came from MMR (15,321). Thane city recorded 1,370 fresh cases on Friday while three deaths were reported, taking the virus’s toll to 1,398.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Power demand soars with increase in mercury levels||MUMBAI: The rising mercury levels have led to power consumption soaring across the state, especially in Mumbai. The peak power demand in Maharashtra was the highest this year at 24,877 MW on Friday morning of which the demand in Mumbai was 2,664 MW, according to officials in Mahagenco. Power generation has also increased lately with Mahagenco contributing to 8,000 MW, Tata Power 1,000 MW and Adani Electricity 500 MW. The remaining approximately 15,400 MW was procured from the power exchange and through the long/short-term power purchase agreements. Officials said there was still a surplus of around 5,000 MW which means the state is prepared to cater to higher consumption during summer. As a result of the lockdown, power demand had fallen to 15,000 MW in April and May last year. This gradually increased to 18,000 MW in June, and averaged between 20,000-21,000 MW from July to December. In January 2021, demand peaked to 22,000 MW and further to 23,000 MW in February. “On March 9, Mahagenco created a record with overall power generation of 10,445 MW —the highest in 60 years in Maharashtra—through its thermal power stations, hydro and solar projects and gas-based station,” an official from the state’s power generation company said. This followed energy minister Nitin Raut’s directives to increase electricity generation to meet the summer demand, he said. The last record of highest generation by all state-owned power plants together was 10,098 MW on May 20, 2019. Power expert Ashok Pendse said though there was a drop in consumption during the initial Covid months, the push from the automobile and other manufacturing sectors was massive after production took off post October. “This drove consumption in a big way. It also went up as shops, malls and other establishments opened up,” he added. Sources said Mumbai’s demand could rise to 3,500MW per day, and MMR’s to 5,000 MW.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-power-demand-soars-with-increase-in-mercury-levels/articleshow/81879000.cms||Somit Sen

The Centre was working to make TN youth job-providers instead of being job-seekers, Modi said. The PM was campaigning for AIADMK candidates in southern districts, including ministers R B Udhayakumar, Sellur K Raju and Dindigul C Srinivasan, and BJP candidates of Madurai and Karaikudi, Dr P Saravanan and H Raja. In line with the tone of the NDA campaign, the PM sought to project the alliance as protectors of Tamil culture who will ensure women’s safety. He said Madurai, the seat of Tamil culture, was also an example of the saying Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, (together, for everyone’s growth, with everyone’s trust) as it had embraced people from the Sourashtra community who had come from Gujarat centuries ago. They had also welcomed Telugu-speakers. The Congress and DMK which tried to project themselves as protectors of Tamil culture and language, worked against them in 2011 by banning jallikattu. “A UPA leader called jallikattu a barbaric act. Is something closely associated with Tamil culture a barbaric act?’’ he asked. Modi said he had always been sensitive to the needs of Tamil people and had passed the ordinance to allow jallikattu in 2017. During the 20-minute-long speech, Modi invoked the names of freedom fighters Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar, V O Chidambaranar and dalit leader Immanuel Sekharan besides political heroes like MGR and Kamaraj saying their lives were inspiring. Modi recalled that southern districts were dear to late chief minister MGR. “When the Congress dismissed the democratically elected MGR government in 1980, it was from Madurai west that he was re-elected and returned to power, he said, adding that none could forget MGR’s famous film “Madurai Veeran”. The PM also made special mention of the Sourashtra community, recalling the contributions of its leaders like N M R Subburaman to Madurai. On AIIMS, the PM said the Congress or DMK did not think about bringing the premier hospital to Madurai. The hospital will have a state-of-the-art infectious disease section and the project would be completed as per process. Continuing his tirade against DMK and Congress for “continuing to insult women,” he said these parties have not understood the ethos of Madurai, which idolises women including Goddess Meenakshi, Rani Mangammal and Kannagi. Law and order would suffer if these parties came to power, he said. He said Lord Shiva had enacted his leelas on Madurai soil most of which were connected to water management. Water was something the central government was focussing on through its schemes. Perennial flow of water in Vaigai would be ensured. Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami K Palaniswami hailed the PM as a person who kept his word and rolled out the Covid vaccine in a year. He had also lifted the image of India at the global level. Deputy CM O Panneerselvam said this election was about dharma versus adharma and good against evil and people should vote for the AIADMK alliance to ensure good governance continues. Later in the evening, the PM campaigned in Nagercoil for Lok Sabha byelection candidate Pon Radhakrishnan and alliance candidates for the assembly elections. He said the central government never discriminated against people in the name of caste and creed. It was sensitive to the needs of farmers, and was working towards doubling their income. Similarly, fishermen’s welfare was being given importance. Harbours were being upgraded and new fish landing sites developed. “A new harbour would come up near Chennai,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/pm-in-madurai-vote-for-nda-to-ensure-tns-development/articleshow/81878060.cms||Padmini Sivarajah
---||Dehradun||Tota Ghati route, connecting Rishikesh with Badrinath, reopens after 3 weeks||Dehradun: After remaining closed for three weeks, the Tota Ghati road has been reopened for people. Due to road widening and blasting, long traffic jams and holdovers were witnessed on both sides of the stretch due to which the route had been shut to speed up work before the start of Cham Dham Yatra. On March 15, CM Tirath Singh Rawat had held a meeting with the state officials to discuss the Char Dham preparations as the yatra is scheduled to commence on May 17. Thereafter, the CM had ordered the closure of Tota Ghati for the road widening work of the Char Dham All Weather Road project. The broadening of the road on the National Highway-59 route which connects Rishikesh with Badrinath and Kedarnath has been completed and the remaining works are likely to be completed within a month’s time, Hari Om Sharma, engineer-in-chief of the Public Works Department, told TOI. Hari Om Sharma, engineer-in-chief of the Public Works Department, told TOI, “The entire stretch of the Tota Ghati is over 2-km-long but the area of concern was a patch of 300 metres. In the last few weeks, the road widening process and debris removal has been completed and the road has been opened for vehicular movement on Friday.” He pointed out that the remaining works like black topping of the road and construction of the retaining walls would be completed in a month’s time. “Before the start of the Char Dham yatra, the work on the Tota Ghati stretch would be finished,” said the senior official. The completion of the road widening work will cut down commute time significantly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/tota-ghati-route-connecting-rishikesh-with-badrinath-reopens-after-3-weeks/articleshow/81876544.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Kochi||ABVP members arrested for harassing nuns in Jhansi||JHANSI: Within hours of arresting two persons for allegedly harassing two nuns at Jhansi railway station on March 19, the police arrested the third accused on Thursday night. The accused is an ABVP office-bearer named Tiwari, who was also travelling on the same train with the nuns. He had lodged a complaint with Jhansi GRP against them. The move comes two weeks after two nuns were harassed at Jhansi. The arrested persons were identified as Ajay Shankar Tiwari, office-bearer of ABVP, Anchal Arjaria, president of Rashtra Bhakt Sangathan and Purgesh Amaria, secretary of Hindu Jagran Manch. The nuns were accused of taking two young girls for religious conversion. Jhansi police said punitive action was taken against trio for their misbehaviour towards the nuns and adolescent girls on Utkal Express on March 19 . Arjaria and Amaria were also planning a protest accusing the police for not taking action against the nuns, said a senior policeman. SP GRP Lucknow, Saumitra Yadav, who holds additional charge of Jhansi, said the three men were arrested under CrPC Section 151 as they were accused of creating ruckus at the railway station. “They will be in prison till April 6 and will be presented in court on April 7. During investigation, we found that Tiwari and Arjaria were the main accused in the incident,” he added. The nuns — Livia Thomas and Hemlata — along with two girls Shweta and Bitrang were travelling to Rourkela in B2 compartment of Utkal Express from Delhi on March 19. ABVP leader Tiwari was travelling in the next compartment. Seeing the nuns and the two girls, he suspected religious conversion and informed Jhansi GRP. Tiwari also flashed the message to some Hindu outfit leaders who gathered at Jhansi railway station. Later, he gave a written complaint at GRP station accusing the nuns of forceful conversion. On reaching Jhansi, all four of them were interrogated on the basis of Tiwari’s information for around three hours at GRP station. The complaint was found to be baseless and all four were allowed to leave after the facts were established.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/abvp-members-arrested-for-harassing-nuns-in-jhansi/articleshow/81877318.cms||Arindam Ghosh
---||Lucknow||Architect of 1971 war was ideal blend of head & heart||Lt Gen (retd) BNBM Prasad As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the historic victory in the 1971 Indo-Pakistan War, exceptional leadership qualities exhibited by then Army Chief late Field Marshal SHFJ Manekshaw, popularly known as Sam Manekshaw, stand distinct. He was undoubtedly the supreme architect and the shining star of that monumental feat, leading to the birth of Bangladesh. The then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, wanted an immediate all-out war with Pakistan to put an end to the worst refugee and security crisis that India was facing then. She consulted General Sam Manekshaw, who extended all possible military support, but did not give consent for an immediate war, much to the chagrin of his detractors and political pundits. Instead, he asked her to wait for some time and strike when India would have a tactical advantage. Gandhi accepted his view since she knew very well that her most trusted Army Chief can never go wrong. In that milieu of perfect political and military synergy, General Manekshaw pulled out a miracle that was never witnessed before. Under his able military leadership, Pakistan had to bite the dust with her ignominious Army led by General Niazi Khan surrendering along with 93,000 prisoners of war. For India, this was the inflection point and God’s gift for regaining the nation’s pride and reposing faith in her military abilities after the country lost to China in the 1962 war. SHFJ Manekshaw, born in an illustrious Parsi family on 3 April, 1914, at Amritsar, wanted to become a doctor but destiny took him to Indian Military Academy in Dehradun from where he emerged successful in the first batch of Indian Commissioned officers in 1934. During his chequered military career spanning over four decades, he charmed everyone with his magnetic personality that was a perfect blend of the head and the heart. He had innumerable admirers, including his seniors, for his razor-sharp intellect, compassionate attitude and uncanny ability to defuse a crisis with his benchmark wit and humor. This quality enabled him to see greater heights in his life despite facing many setbacks. As a Captain while serving in Burma during the World War-II, he not only survived bullet injuries that were complicated by the most dreaded wound sepsis but also most deservingly earned the much-coveted Military Cross for his daredevil actions while battling for his life with serious war injuries. He came out unscathed from a disciplinary proceeding that was initiated against him on a false charge of his detractor while he was a senior officer and due for his promotion. After suffering initial setbacks during the 1971 War, he led the Indian Army to supreme glory by carving out one of the finest military victories of all times. I consider myself extremely fortunate to be associated with such an illustrious man as his physician that enabled me to serve him till the very end. He died on June 27, 2008 at the ripe age of 94, when I was at his bedside at the Military Hospital Wellington with both his daughters, Maya and Sherry, holding his hands with great reverence and affection. Till the end, he was visited by innumerable admirers including then President Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, who, like many in the world, considered Field Marshal Manekshaw as an iconic military leader, possessing exceptional abilities and his famous words in the visitor’s book of Military Hospital Wellington, “Military Hospital Wellington is always contributing the best. Please take care of our great wealth, our only Field Marshal Manekshaw”, echoes this sentiment. Even after more than a decade of his death, he continues to inspire millions like me, remaining evergreen in our memories. God bless his soul with eternal happiness.

The case came to light on Thursday after the sharpshooter spilled the beans in front of police. The accused mother, Geeta Lohar, 55, told police that her son Jitendra Lohar was a habitual drinker and was eating away her family’s saving, which is why she had to take the extreme step. A case was registered at Chiksana Police Station in Bharatpur and the body was recovered on March 21. The victim was shot in the head in a secluded place with liquor pouches spread around the body. The body was identified on the same day. Police began investigation on the same day and scanned CCTV footage from the nearby areas to find that a bike-borne person was following the victim. “The biker turned out to be from the gang of Chitraram Thakur. He revealed that they were hired by Vipin Kumar for killing Jitendra. The deal was fixed for Rs 3 lakh and Rs 2 lakh was paid on January 1 by Vipin. Later, Vipin was arrested who revealed that the main conspirator was the mother who was upset and disturbed due to the ill habits of her son,” said police. The mother was arrested by police who along with Vipin was sent in police remand by a local court. Police further added that Geeta has Rs 7 lakh in her bank account and property worth Rs 50 lakh to her name. She feared that her son would spend all the savings and sell off the property leaving her homeless. She has two daughters and a son, while both the daughters were married. “Vipin was close to Geeta who had made him the nominee of bank savings. Jeetendra didn’t have good relations with her sisters and brothers-in-law,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bharatpur-woman-hires-sharpshooter-to-kill-alcoholic-son/articleshow/81878073.cms||---

The incident raised panic in the highly congested area. It took more than three hours for fire tenders to bring the situation under control. The fire was reported around 12.20 pm from the ground floor of the building and the fire fight was finally called off at 3.45 pm. Police said the place was being used as a godown to store electronic items. Though no one was injured, thick black smoke emitting from the house led to the administration clearing adjacent buildings. Though reports initially claimed that one firefighter fell ill during operations, the fire department and police dismissed such claims. The fire department said they had dispatched nine fire tenders to the spot. Following the protocol that had helped them fight the fire on Strand Road barely 48 hours ago, the firefighters broke the glass of the building. A machine that acted as a ‘vacuum cleaner’ was used to suck out the smoke. The hydraulic ladder too was in place and most importantly, each firefighter was provided with safety equipment. The cause of the blaze is yet to be ascertained, fire officials said. The forensic team is likely to visit the spot on Saturday. “A short circuit might be one of the reasons but it is too early to predict. The fact that two offices inside the building were closed due to Good Friday was a blessing,”said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/lenin-sarani-fire-guts-godown-sparks-panic/articleshow/81877321.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Jaipur||Sambar deer with broken jaw spotted inside Ranthambore core area||JAIPUR: A picture of a bleeding Sambar deer with complete broken jaw and chafed tongue ignited a debate over alleged prevalence of poaching inside the core area of the Ranthambore National Park (RNP). The picture was taken by a gypsy driver during an afternoon safari near Bakola region inside the core area. While environmentalists claimed the wild animal sustained serious injuries after it bit a crude bomb (golai) placed by poachers, the forest department, however, refuted the allegation and claimed it as a crocodile bite. RNP, DFO, Mahendra Sharma said, “The pattern indicates it’s a crocodile bite. There are past pictorial references with forest staff in which crocodile bites were recorded in similar manner. At present, water bodies in Bakola region are full with good population of crocodiles.” Environmentalists, however, countered, “The jaw portion of the Sambar is the strongest. Crocodile bite crushing a small portion of face is nearly impossible.” It is suspected that some villagers on the periphery area of RNP plant explosives to kill or deter wild boars and other wild animals from entering their farmlands. Forest officials claimed planting a country-made bomb deep inside the forest will not be a useful practice for villagers. Tapeshwar Singh Bhati, a green activist said, “There is a possibility that an incident has occurred in the peripheral area and the deer walked inside the forest after the injury. Hunting of prey animals, especially wild boar, has increased after lockdown. There are recorded incidents when the forest department arrested the poachers in December 2020. The crude bomb could have been kept for wild boar.” Earlier, after a camera trap picture with a wire snare around the neck of tiger T-108 in RNP surfaced on December 6, the forest department had issued a red alert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sambar-deer-with-broken-jaw-spotted-inside-rbore-core-area/articleshow/81878077.cms||---

---||India||Covid-19 ‘lab leak theory’: China attacks India stand||NEW DELHI: After India supported WHO chief Tedros Ghebreyesus’s call for a deeper probe into the origin of Covid-19, China responded on Friday by saying that the study of the virus’s origin was a matter of science and to politicise this issue would “severely hinder global cooperation in study of origins, jeopardise anti-pandemic cooperation, and cost more lives”. It would run counter to the international community’s aspiration for solidarity against the virus, the Chinese embassy here said in a statement. “Study of origins is a global mission that should be conducted in multiple countries and localities. We believe the joint WHO-China study will effectively stimulate global cooperation in origin-tracing,” the embassy spokesperson said. India had on Thursday backed Ghebreyesus’s remarks in which he had raised the issue of delays and difficulties in accessing raw data for a team conducting a global study into the issue. The WHO chief had also called for a deeper probe into the lab leak theory. India appreciated his readiness to deploy additional missions for the probe. The Chinese embassy spokesperson referred to the WHO-China report released earlier this week which concluded that lab leak was unlikely, describing it as an important scientific conclusion made clear in the joint study report. “As for the question of further research, experts of the WHO mission said there has always been speculation about lab leak, and work could be done with laboratories around the world if there is further evidence that the hypothesis needs to be reassessed,” the spokesperson said. “The experts said the virus may have been spread in places other than China early on, and a global perspective is needed to carry out the origin-tracing work. The report also proposes multiple tasks to be conducted worldwide. We hope relevant countries can cooperate with WHO expert mission in an open, transparent and responsible manner like China did,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-lab-leak-theory-china-attacks-india-stand/articleshow/81880411.cms||---

During patrolling, forest department assistant forest conservator Vijay Borana and Vanpal Kanwaraj Singh saw the GIB with the chick. He said that in the Sudasari area, earlier, seven female GIBs were seen with chicks which hatched from the eggs last year, whereas the chick seen on March 31 is probably a week old, which shows that GIB breeding started in February this year. Due to a good monsoon last year, there is sufficient sevan grass, which is a natural habitat for GIB.Chandrawal said that patrolling at Sudasari has been increased, along with security. Apart from 7 female GIBs in Sudasari area, 9 healthy GIBs are at GIB breeding centre in Sam and now, sighting of a chick is a good sign. Due to regular patrolling by field staff at DNP along with security systems, good results are expected in the field of GIB conservation. He said the ongoing GIB conservation breeding programme is being implemented under a tripartite agreement between the state government, ministry of environment, forest & climate change, government of India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gib-chick-sighted-at-desert-national-park-in-jaisalmer/articleshow/81878082.cms||---

Depending on conditions turning favourable, the storm could hit the city either on Saturday or Sunday. But it may not have a lasting impact on the weather, which will remain warm and humid. The scorching westerly winds, that have been blowing into the city for the last 10 days pulling the mercury up, is set to weaken over the next 48 hours. Moisture incursion from Bay of Bengal, that has been negligible so far, is expected to rise. “These two will combine to generate a thunderstorm over the weekend. While there has been enough heating over the last 10 days, absence of moisture prevented a thunderstorm. From Saturday, we expect more moisture that will lead to favourable conditions,” said RMC director GK Das. Last Wednesday, Kolkata recorded highest maximum temperature of the year so far (39.3 ° C). It was also the warmest March day in seven years. Around a dozen thundershowers usually hit Kolkata between March and May. “A scorching spell is necessary to set the process rolling. But this year has been an exception. We have rarely seen a long, dry spell with westerly winds and so less moisture incursion,” said a weather scientist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/thunderstorm-on-met-radar-may-hit-kolkata-this-weekend/articleshow/81877328.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh govt schools get a makeover||LUCKNOW: In order to improve quality of education, government schools under the leadership of chief minister Yogi Adityanath have been given a major makeover, said a UP government spokesperson. State-run primary schools, he said, have outperformed private schools in terms of basic facilities and infrastructure. According to the spokesperson, the UP government, instead of establishing new schools, converted as many as 102 out of the 2,504 existing government schools in the Gorakhpur district into English medium institutions after giving thorough training to the teachers and providing English books. Aiming for quality education, the Yogi government is amalgamating traditional teaching methodology with tech-based learning through computers and projectors. All the smart classes have been equipped with modern facilities, which has enhanced the understanding of the students. In many districts, more than 100 primary schools have been developed at par with private schools. Following the instructions of the chief minister, more than 80% of primary and upper primary schools including the schools in Naharpur, Gulharia and Janipur in the Gorakhpur district have been fully transformed. These schools now have improved washrooms with multiple hand wash dispensers to ensure overall hygiene and have also been made more appealing with vibrant wall paintings and in addition to this, the old hand pumps in all the schools have now been replaced with RO filtered water. Rickety old desks have been replaced with new ones and the dimly lit classrooms with crumbling ceilings are now boasting ample light and fresh interiors. Consequently, the number of students in government schools has also increased rapidly. Parents are enrolling their children in government schools instead of choosing expensive private schools. According to the district panchayati raj officer, Himanshu Thakur, 14 parameters under Operation Kayakalp have been formulated to develop the government schools, which include separate toilets for male and female students, hand wash dispensers and wash basins, appropriate floors and corridors with tiles, proper desks and furniture as well as adequate supply of electricity. So far, over 1,700 primary state-run schools have been transformed on nine parameters. Efforts are being made to fulfill the remaining standards soon. The transformation is seen also in the standard of education. Sushma Tripathi, a teacher at Rudrapur Primary School, Khajni, said that kids at her school speak fluent English. “The government has recognised our efforts. There is a smart class, beautiful classrooms and a library for children. The most important thing is that schoolchildren now speak English. The medium of education in this school is English,” Tripathi said. Harsh Srivastava, a teacher of Sahulakhore Primary School, Khajni and Garima Shahi, a teacher of Daudpur Primary School, Gorakhpur said that their schools have been equipped with modern facilities, smart classrooms and libraries just like private schools. According to Basic Shiksha Adhikari, Gorakhpur, BN Singh, all the old, dilapidated schools in the villages will be transformed and revamped after a complete report has been received.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-govt-schools-get-a-makeover/articleshow/81879042.cms||---

The garganey, which migrates to central Africa and parts of India during the winter, makes a brief stopover at Yamuna Biodiversity Park on its return journey to Europe. Birders disclosed that the number of other migratory birds in and around Delhi had also reduced, indicating they had begun flying back to Europe. Faiyaz Khudsar, scientist in charge at the Yamuna Biodiversity Park, said the duck species was first spotted at the nature reserve in early winter when they halted while on their flight to other locations in India. “They are spotted again in March for around two weeks when they make a stopover while returning to their native habitat,” Khudsar informed. “When the migratory birds arrived at Yamuna Biodiversity Park, many resident birds, including the little cormorant, Indian cormorant, darter and grey herons, shifted to narrow wetlands or marshy areas. However, with the migratory birds leaving the area, the resident birds have reoccupied the bigger wetlands of the park,” said Khudsar. Among the species whose numbers have decreased in the last few days are the gadwall, northern pintail, common teal, northern shoveler, tufted duck and the great cormorant. Bird watchers said the migratory birds made preparations before beginning the long flight home. Most birds don’t fly for long during their stay in the area for three-four months, so make short flights to and from wetlands to tone their body muscles. “As the birds do not eat while flying, they store fat in their bodies for energy before flying to their breeding destination. They also moult and get their breeding plumage,” said Surya Prakash, a retired scientist from Jawaharlal Nehru University. “For instance, the brown-headed gull and black-headed gull are mostly white in colour with greying feathers when they arrive at the onset of the winter. They turn completely dark brown for the breeding season.” Nikhil Devasar, an avid birder, said that with the temperatures beginning to rise from February onwards and many wetlands suffering a scarcity of water due to the fewer number of rainy days since then, the migratory birds began returning to their home habitats from the third week of February. “All the species of migratory birds are heading back home and their numbers in Delhi are currently low,” Devasar reiterated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/migratory-birds-touch-down-as-they-start-heading-back-home/articleshow/81891670.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The accused was fined Rs 20,000 which will be given to the victim as compensation. Refusing to let the accused off on a bond of good behaviour, the court said that such offences are becoming a menace. “Other accused persons have also absconded, due to the facilitation of being able to commit the offence from a remote distance by using the technological advancement which ought to be used only for the betterment of the society, and which is being gravely misused...,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-gets-4-yrs-in-jail-for-using-forged-docus-duplicate-sim/articleshow/81879099.cms||---

---||Jaipur||PGs complying policy norms can come under guest house scheme||JAIPUR: The guest house policy for urban areas cleared by state Cabinet on Wednesday allows existing paying guest houses offering between six and 20 rooms to be covered under the policy. But the policy has stipulated that the residential plot should be located on a road having 30 feet width and the size should be 167 square metre or more. Despite their location being in residential areas, they are likely to pay commercial rates for water and electricity consumption even though the policy does not mention about it, said an official in the tourist department. As per the policy, the guest house units need to possess fire safety and FSSAI licenses and have to submit building plan of the residence prepared by an architect. In the 20 rooms, excluding the three rooms where the family can stay for the look after the guests, not more than 40 beds would be allowed. The size of each room needs to be 120 square feet or above. The guest houses will be classified under two categories – A and B – factoring in facilities like AC, western toilets, refrigerator and branding etc. The registration fees will be Rs 5,000, and Rs 3,000 for categories A and B, respectively. The policy was introduced in compliance to the provision in Tourism Policy, 2020. The PG scheme up to five rooms in residential houses is already in place in the state. But at several occasions, the stakeholders have raised the issue of non-viability to run PG houses up to five rooms professionally as they have to pay electricity, water and other charges on commercial rates. Moreover, many PG houses after obtaining approval from tourism department add more rooms to make it viable but do not disclose the same. The guest house scheme will allow the residential house owners or lessee to offer professional services and also ensure that the guests stay with an Indian family. Under this scheme a lessee can also run a residential house provided the family of the lessee stays in the premises. The scheme is aimed at increasing the availability of affordable accommodation, raise the inventory of rooms, provide experience to stay with a family and put to use the huge investment in residential properties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pgs-complying-policy-norms-can-come-under-guest-house-scheme/articleshow/81878078.cms||---

Nearly 40,000 from the age-group of 45-59 years came out to get vaccinated before the weekend.

The civic body is targeting one lakh vaccinations a day from next week.  Across state, as many as 1,51,526 people between 45-59 years of age had taken the vaccine on Thursday. For the first time, this age group had beaten the senior citizen category in vaccination. Principal health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas has asked districts to vaccinate on a ‘carpet bombing’ mode and finish the stock of vaccine it has received from the Centre in the last 5-7 days. The state has finished administering 65.56 lakh doses to people, of which 57.90 lakh are first doses. This means a little over 7.65 lakh people have taken both doses.

The water hyacinth has been leading to an increase in the mosquito menace in localities along the rivers. Citizens have been demanding an effective, long-term solution to this recurring issue. Various options were discussed to overcome the problem at a meeting held under the chairmanship of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday. Pawar told the civic administrations and state irrigation department to visit the sites, where water hyacinth proliferated and prepare a detailed report with an execution plan at the earliest. Pawar also asked irrigation department officials to review the status of water hyacinth in the Bhima river. Additional commissioner of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) Kunal Khemnar said, “A detailed discussion was held on the water hyacinth issue. Both civic bodies will explore if the hyacinth can be removed using hi-tech machines. The administrations will check the expenses that will have to be incurred to purchase or procure the machinery on rent. Discussion was also held on clearing the hyacinth from Pashan, Katraj and Jambhulwadi lakes.” A PMC official said that the possibility of reducing the water level in Pashan and Katraj lakes to remove the hyacinth will be considered. Technical suggestions will be sought from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB). Suggestions tabled during the meeting included arresting the release of drainage water and dumping of garbage in rivers and lakes. The civic officials said that steps have already been initiated at some locations to remove the water hyacinth before the monsoon sets in. Citizens and elected representatives have been complaining about the menace. Vikram Patil, who regularly travels via Harris bridge, said that the river is full of hyacinth. “Why has the issue not been resolved permanently, despite spending a lot of money every year,” Patil wondered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/time-bound-plan-to-help-remove-water-hyacinth/articleshow/81877326.cms||---

Police have arrested the four. The cops said that both the main accused and the victim were in love with the same woman. Ritesh Patel, 25, of Ghatlodia was kidnapped on March 24 by Meet Patel, a DJ, and others. A complaint was filed on the following day. The complaint states that Ritesh had been in love with the woman in question for over six years, since his school days. He is now in the third year of the civil engineering course at a Khatraj college. Ritesh said that on March 24, he was standing near Trishala Residency when four persons arrived on the scene in a car. They were wearing masks. They approached him and blasted him for interacting with the woman. It became clear soon that one of the men was Meet, who pushed Ritesh into the car and abused and slapped him. Ritesh stated that he was taken to an isolated place where he was beaten severely. He said that he was even branded on his face. The accused later left him on SG Highway. Police said that the woman had first come across Meet six months ago at a party at which he was the DJ. In time, the woman apparently began to develop feelings for Meet. But she continued to remain in love with Ritesh. Police said that one day Meet checked the woman’s cellphone and found messages between her and Ritesh. The woman allegedly said that Ritesh had been forcing her to talk with him. Eventually, she admitted that she continued to have a relationship with Ritesh.Police said Meet was incensed by the woman’s confession and planned the kidnapping with his friends Deepak Patel, Saurin Patel, and Chirag Yadav. Police have now sent Meet’s cellphone to the forensic science laboratory to recover the nude video which he had deleted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/love-rivalry-kidnapping-and-nude-clip-4-held/articleshow/81877354.cms||---

However, in next one week, we are expecting its prices to be Rs 50 per kg to Rs 60 per kg for retail customers,” said Anil Samtanil, another wholesale dealer of mangoes at the Sodala-situated fruit market. Traders stated that last year due to lockdown and Covid-19, the supply was badly affected. “Now, the supply has improved and hopefully, people will relish all qualities of mangoes at much cheaper prices from April 15 onwards,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bumper-crop-brings-down-mango-prices-this-yr/articleshow/81878091.cms||Ashish Mehta
---||Mumbai||In Pune, slew of curbs for a week from today in Maharashtra||Pune: Stringent restrictions such as a 6pm-to-6am bar on travel, closure of bars, no dine-in at restaurants,weekly markets or the assembly of more than five people even during the daytime will come into force from Saturday for seven days across Pune district to check the rise in Covid-19 cases. The district administration on Friday decided against a lockdown but announced these restrictions while excluding essential services from their ambit. Food delivery from eateries will be allowed till 11pm. Lodging facilities for guests at hotels can continue in Pune, but their restaurant services would not be allowed for outsiders, Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar said. In-room dining and takeaway services were permitted. The authorities said a review of the restrictions will follow after seven days. The announcement, particularly the night travel restriction, set off concern among citizens about undue harassment and excesses by the police. Pune MP Girish Bapat said, “The police, while enforcing the restrictions, should not beat up citizens. Their deterrence should be enough but people should not feel terrorised.” Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta said all their officers and constabulary have been instructed to strictly adopt a humane approach and understand people and their problems during the enforcement. “Our intent is not to harass the public. Rather, we will sensitise people to follow the state’s directives,” he said. Full report on www.toi.in Industrial bodies like the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture and CII were also worried about the impact of the restrictions on their supplies. Their representatives said stopping PMPML bus services would affect their workforce. Affected office-goers in IT parks and BPOs were also uneasy about the travel curbs. Upset owners of restaurants, bars and eateries have planned a protest on Saturday. They said the seven-day closure would badly impact their business and set of a mass exodus of their staff. Multiplex bodies feared disruption of new film releases in Pune while owners of shops in malls said another setback at a time when they were recovering would stall any progress. Speaking to reporters after a Covid-19 review meeting on Friday, chaired by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said the stringent measures were imposed after observing the rise in the district’s positivity rate. The rate is the percentage of individuals testing positive from those tested for Covid-19. “It has risen in the range of 27% to 32% (from 26.7% on March 31) and the cases have also gone up. Last week, there were about 6,000 cases per day which have now increased to 8,000 per day. Health experts have said it may go up to 9,000 cases per day in the coming weeks. This needs micro-planning, ramping up testing and other measures,” he said. Rao said they want to achieve a golden mean by ensuring stricter restrictions with fewer hassles, through stricter vigilance in the micro-containment zones and monitoring of home isolation cases, and a greater focus on testing, particularly of the superspreaders. Private offices can function with up to 50% staff who can travel by showing valid I-cards. Rao said they did not want crowding even during the daytime and hence the restriction on the assembly of more than five people even during the day. Joint commissioner of police Ravindra Shisve said, “There will be several check posts where the purpose of travel during the restricted hours will be assessed. During the daytime too, we will enforce the ban on assembly of more than five persons. Industries will have to make their own vehicle arrangements for ferrying people to and from their workplace.” Hospitals Told To Ramp Up Beds Rao said private hospitals were directed to increase the beds to the highest level as was done last October. “We may have to convert some hospitals into dedicated Covid centres. We are going to increase beds at the Sassoon General Hospital and are activating the jumbo Covid hospitals too. Vacant posts at these medical facilities are being filled up,” he added. Five deputy collectors will keep a watch on hospitals and auditing of bills will start, Rao said. Cases were on the rise in Sangli, Satara, Kolhapur and Solapur in Pune division, he said. “As of now patients from other districts coming to Pune for treatment has not started, but if it does, the health infrastructure here would be under huge pressure,” he added. The municipal commissioners of Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad also issued guidelines for the new restrictions. “The orders are in accordance with the Disaster Management Act 2005 and the Epidemic Disease Act 1897,” Pune’s civic chief Vikram Kumar said. Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil said, “We will step up the vaccination drive and the current curbs will not affect it,” he added.

---||Nagpur||At 4,108 cases, Nagpur district logs highest one day spike||NAGPUR: The district on Friday registered a new high of 4,108 Covid-19 positive cases, with recoveries at 3,214. There were 60 deaths due to Covid for the second consecutive day. The district civil surgeon (CS) said 2,857 cases were from city, 1,248 from rural (which was highest ever for rural too), and three from other districts for total of 4,108 cases on Friday. As per state’s public health department (PHD), cases were even higher at 4,201 in the district on Friday. Total number of cases surged to 2,33,776. The earlier highest cases for a day were 4,095 on March 26. Now, cases have been above 4,000 for two days in last eight days. The district was probably third among all in country, after Mumbai (9,903) and Pune (9,128) in number of cases on Friday. Of 60 fatalities, 27 deceased were from the city, 30 from rural and three from other districts. This is the first time rural has recorded 30 deaths in a day. Earlier highest fatalities was 21 in last two consecutive days for rural areas. Despite rise in cases as well as deaths, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is yet to implement directives given by the state government for containing cases and controlling deaths. With spike in cases, the state and central government had directed all civic bodies to ensure institutional isolation of asymptomatic positive patients as much as possible. As per data of CS, the district had 40,807 active cases on Friday, the highest-ever for a day in the year-long pandemic. Of these, 31,420 (77%) were in home isolation. The number will be even higher as status of 4,108 patients detected on Friday will be known on Saturday. Only 396 (0.97%) patients were in Covid Care Centres (CCCs) of which 268 in city and 128 in rural, while 4,883 (11.97%) were undergoing treatment in hospitals. To control deaths, the state on March 23 suggested monitoring all parameters of patients in CCCs at every four hours. Also, the state had directed civic bodies to engage one staffer against 10 patients in home isolation to visit them daily, and ensure patients don’t step out. Directives were also given to contact patients in home isolation twice a day and check parameters to control deaths. As per NMC sources, the staffers at NMC Control Room contact patients on first day, followed by fourth or seventh day, and then on tenth day for recovery. As per NMC data, 152 rapid response teams (RRT) comprising two-three staffers each have been appointed for visiting patients in home isolation, tracing contacts and testing. Also, 20 flying squads are appointed for ensuring there is no violation of guidelines on home isolation. Thus, 172 teams are appointed for the 27,000 patients in home isolation in the city. It comes to around one team for every 160 patients in home isolation. There are many complaints from citizens and NGOs about positive patients stepping out of home isolation. Even the civic body itself had confirmed many times such violation and also taken action on a few patients. Activist Narayan Ahuja said, “Daily monitoring of patients in home isolation can curb cases as well as deaths. Still, the NMC is not concentrating on this crucial aspect.” NMC officials said sufficient number of employees are not available to comply with government’s directive of one staffer after every 10 patients in home isolation. “We have engaged even teachers in RRT in the situation. We are planning to take staffers from other departments too,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/at-4108-cases-nagpur-district-logs-highest-one-day-spike/articleshow/81878093.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Delhi||‘Robust legal framework needed to protect data’||New Delhi: India has the potential to emerge as global hub of international arbitration, Union minister for information technology and law Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Saturday. Addressing the ‘International Conference on Globalisation of Professional Education: Constitutional Conspectus’, organised by Bennett University’s School of Law, the minister said India was set to play a global role in economy, supply chain and international trade and, therefore, had to become a hub for arbitration. While inviting foreign firms to take advantage of India’s unique potential, the minister also underlined the need to protect “data privacy of people and data sovereignty” of the country. “International supply chains are going to raise new challenges, new legal issues,” Prasad told an audience of academics and students, adding that there needed to be a “robust legal architecture” to protect data in a digital economy like India. “After all, any digital economy generates data. If I ask my department to pull out data of this interaction today, it will run into thousands and thousands,” the minister observed. “I would like the vice-chancellor to know that India has the biggest operation of Facebook and WhatsApp, the third biggest operation of Twitter. All social media companies are doing good business in India.” Prasad said while social media had empowered Indians, there was a need to flag concerns not on the use, but the misuse and abuse of social media. This had been articulated in the new social media guidelines, he said, pointing out that the consent to share data had be an informed one. “What happens when a victim of abuse and misuse doesn’t get a proper forum for grievances? What should I do as minister of IT and communications when a distraught mother comes to me complaining that her teen daughter’s former boyfriend is posting all intimate pictures on social media? should I keep quiet?” Prasad asked. “I have a commitment to her dignity. A victim of abuse and misuse must have a forum for settlement of grievances within a time frame.” Stressing on need to respect the Indian Constitution and the country’s laws, the minister said, “If Twitter appreciates police action on Capitol Hill in Washington, it is good. But how is it that when an Indian symbol of democracy, the Red Fort, is attacked by aggressors you side with them? This is unacceptable.” In his address, Prasad also explained how rules and regulations were reformed to allow work from home during the pandemic. He said norms were changed, and regulatory restrictions removed, thus allowing 85% of the IT industry to operate via work from home. “The PM told me that work from home should now be elevated to work from anywhere,” he disclosed. The minister said there was both a government and private obligation in ensuring quality higher education in India, and urged the Bar Council of India, which governs legal education, to “reflect” on the challenges and opportunities offered by higher legal education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/robust-legal-framework-needed-to-protect-data/articleshow/81891681.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Morphed photos of Anand Niketan students ‘leaked’||AHMEDABAD: When Class 12 students of Anand Niketan logged on for online classes, they had no clue that the person — who had been threatening to upload morphed photos of girl students on the internet — would finally make good on his ultimatum. The anonymous sender had first made this threat more than seven months ago to force the school to postpone exams. Though the school management and parents had approached the law, the cybercrime police failed to track the sender who subsequently emailed more of such warnings. Probably emboldened by the lack of action, the culprit reportedly joined an ongoing online session for Class 12 on Wednesday morning, and shared with all attendees the link of morphed images of students. The latest demand: ‘No online classes till June first week’. Confirming this, principal Binu Thomas said, “The culprit entered a Zoom session for Class 12 in which 10 students were present. The person did not switch on the video but started commenting on chat and shared the links. Realizing what was happening, the teacher immediately closed the class.” He added, “We have informed the cybercrime cell and they have shut down the link. We have also changed Zoom IDs for all grades right from Class I and issued an assurance letter to parents.” The person first sent a threat email to the school on September 9. The sender threatened to upload morphed pictures of girl students if the school held mid-term exams.  The management cancelled mid-term exams for Classes 8 to 12 in mid-September. It also filed a written complaint with the Ahmedabad cybercrime cell, which was converted into an FIR on October 3. Then, on December 6, the school received another threat email seeking cancellation of prelim exam for Classes 10, 11, and 12 by Monday afternoon. Subsequently, keeping the interest of students in mind, the exams were cancelled. The management also filed a police complaint. Worried parents and school management also met chief minister Vijay Rupani in December to apprise him of the situation. The CM assured them prompt action and all possible support. Yet, the cybercrime police have been unable to land any pertinent lead in the case. Claiming that the threat emails had been sent through the ‘dark web’ which makes tracing difficult, the police have been constant in their reply since Day 1: “Our investigation is on”. Following Wednesday’s incident, the school management has issued a letter to all parents informing them that they are still receiving the threat emails. The letter further mentions, “The investigation is going on, and the parents need to be cautious.” It warned them to ignore defamatory links or images sent to them via any medium. Parents were also told to educate their wards about the need to desist from sharing the morphed images with anyone. Parents, meanwhile, are shocked and upset that the cops have failed to resolve the case, leaving their children’s future at the mercy of the culprit. A parent, seeking anonymity, said, “It is shocking that the cybercrime cell is giving the same statement for the past seven months. If it was the case of some senior politician or a matter of national security, would the police respond in a similar manner?” Another parent maintained, “Either the government is safeguarding someone with connections or the cybercrime cell is incapable of dealing with new-age technological challenges. It is sad that the cops have proved to be incompetent in this case. It is time we sought the support of some national agency.” Director of Anand Niketan Group of Schools, Nashy Chauhan, told TOI: “The matter had been reported to the cybercrime cell right after the first email. Thereafter, every incident related to this was communicated to the cybercrime police. The agencies are trying to solve the case.” ACP (cybercrime) J M Yadav said, “The person intruded into the online session, and wanted online classes to be discontinued. The culprit is using the dark web to carry out the offence. We have been taking help of other premier agencies and even private hackers to nab the accused. Prima facie, he seems to be very professional. We are making our best efforts to nab him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/morphed-photos-of-anand-niketan-students-leaked/articleshow/81877393.cms||---

The food and civil supplies department has sounded its officials to ensure that the process gains momentum by April 15. “Most of the farmers are still in the process of harvesting the crop. We need to wait and watch for few days. All arrangements have been made to facilitate farmers and check distress selling,” a senior official in the food and civil supply department told TOI. Food commissioner Manish Chauhan confirmed that the procurement process did not get the ‘as expected’ start. “The procurement momentum would improve in the next few days,” he said. The state government, as a matter of fact, has not fixed any target for the quantum of wheat procurement which will be done till June 15. “This time, the department would be purchasing limitless wheat,” the official said. Last year, the state government had fixed a target of procuring 55-lakh metric tonnes of wheat against which only 35 lakh metric tonnes could be achieved. Officials said that this was essentially because of the pandemic which restricted the movement of farmers and eventually affected the procurement exercise. Keen to step up the wheat purchase the state government has already decided to increase the procurement centres from 5,000 in 2020-21 to 6000 this year. This has come close on the heels of the state government scaling up the minimum support price for wheat from Rs 1,925 per quintal in 2020-21 to Rs 1,975 per quintal this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/wheat-purchase-to-gain-pace-by-apr-15/articleshow/81879132.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

There is a consensus that the two sides should now quickly resolve the remaining issues along the LAC in eastern Ladakh,” Bagchi said. The government has described the disengagement in Pangong Tso area as a significant step forward that has provided a good basis for resolution of other remaining issues along the LAC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/new-delhi-urges-beijing-to-join-hands-expedite-lac-pullback/articleshow/81880560.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Day later, Sidhana ‘pardon’ creates discord in unions||Bathinda: The decision of Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) and other farmers’ unions to resolve all issues pertaining to the role of gangster-turned-social activist Lakhbir Singh, alias Lakha Sidhana, in the Republic Day violence at Red Fort has led to dissension among Punjab’s farm outfits. On Thursday evening, they had issued a statement, stating they decided to “forgive” Sidhana as the ongoing agitation against the Centre’s three contentious three farm laws “needs young blood”. A day later, questions were raised on the impartiality and limitation of the three-member sub-committee formed to speak to Sidhana or his associates before readmitting him into the struggle. BKU (Ekta Dakonda) president Buta Singh Burjgill, under whose supervision the resolution was passed to seek clarifications from Lakha, on Friday said they will seek an explanation from the three-member committee regarding the announcement on Sidhana without putting the matter before the 32 farm organisations and SKM. The committee has farm leaders Darshan Pal, Jagjit Singh Dallewal and Baldev Singh Sirsa as members. Their representative Kaka Singh held a hurried press conference to announce the “pardon” to Sidhana and allowing him to be part of the morcha in the future. “A meeting of 32 farm organisations was held under my presidentship on March 24, wherein it was decided that if Lakha Sidhana feels sorry for the happenings on the night of January 25, marching on the undecided route on January 26 and promises not to repeat such things in future, then he could be allowed to speak at the SKM stage. To contact him or his representatives, a three-member committee was formed. Baldev Singh Sirsa was present in the meeting, whereas representatives of Darshan Pal and Dallewal were present and they have put their signatures on the resolution,” Burjgill told TOI. “It was decided that after taking the views of Lakha, the committee will put up the matter before 32 farm organisations and SKM, who will make the final decision. But the three (committee members) made a unilateral announcement without taking us into confidence. We will seek an explanation from the three in a meeting to be organised in a couple of days,” he added. Another morcha leader Rajinder Singh said the announcement by the committee should have been avoided and made by the SKM. When contacted, committee member Sirsa, in whose presence the announcement was made, said, “Whatever is to be said will be done in the meeting”. Dallewal was also evasive, saying, “I have been away from Delhi for the last few days and will check what transpired yesterday. I will speak only after checking the details.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/day-later-sidhana-pardon-creates-discord-in-unions/articleshow/81878094.cms||Neel Kamal

Director general, prisons, Anand Kumar, said, an acting DIG (jails) PN Pandey was tasked to conduct a security audit of the jail and prepare a detailed report. “We have got a report and will act accordingly,” Kumar said. Highly-placed sources in the prisons department said, the strength of jail officials would be increased, while Banda SP has been asked to beef up security around the building. “PAC has also been told to maintain its presence,” sources said. Similarly, more CCTVs would be installed at entry and exit points of the prison. During the audit, officials inspected the Tanhai barrack, where Ansari will be lodged.

---||Amritsar||SKM: MHA letter bid to divide farmers, workers||BATHINDA: Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leaders have strongly objected to the letter written by the Union home ministry to Punjab chief secretary and Punjab Police head, saying farmers in border areas treat migrant labourers as bonded labourers and make them work extra hours by intoxicating them. The morcha alleged that the letter was an attempt by the Union government to weaken the farmers’ struggle and drive a wedge between farmers and labourers. The morcha also stated that farm leaders would soon “present the truth about migrant workers.” “The Union government has taken this new step to undermine and defame the farmer movement so as to discredit the farmers of Punjab. The government is afraid of labour-farmer unity and wants to divide the struggle,” morcha members claimed. Farmer leaders alleged that the outpouring of support for the farmers’ movement from artists, sportspersons, social and religious organisations has caused the Centre to try all means to defeat the movement. According to farm leaders, an event is being organised at PAU Ludhiana on Saturday to ascertain ways to strengthen the ongoing farmers’ movement and make a plan for wheat harvesting. During the programme, a representative of farmers’ organisations under SKM will give a brief introduction about the status of the movement and representatives of other organisations as well as individuals will offer suggestions to strengthen the movement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/skm-mha-letter-bid-to-divide-farmers-workers/articleshow/81878095.cms||---

While the owner of Capson Tiles Factory, Arun Patel claims that the labourers were being treated thus as hospitals were full and doctors advised not to admit non-Covid patients. However, video shows some of the labourers, who have been made to sleep at a distance from each other, were lying on the bare floor. Two men were overseeing them. A man is seen sitting with a stock of medicine in the same factory premises where ceramic stock too is seen lying at a distance. Patel told TOI: “These are not Covid patients. Four to five labourers complained of fever and cough two days back and were taken to a nearby private hospital. But the hospital had no space and the doctors there advised us to treat them outside the hospital as they feared they these men too may get infected with Covid in the hospital.” Morbi collector J B Patel said, “With beds about to get full in the hospitals, we will acquire a community school and create 200 more beds. We will also acquire a polytechnic college and by Saturday, make 300 more beds available.” Morbi has four Covid hospitals with total 200 beds capacity, of which more than 180 are already filled. Morbi civil hospital, sub district hospital Wankaner, Halvad and a private hospital are treating Covid patients currently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/fever-patients-treated-on-morbi-ceramic-factorys-floor/articleshow/81877604.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||No gate pass, farmers in Karnal dump stock to protest new mode||Karnal:Farmers unloaded wheat crop outside the Karnal mandi secretary’s office on Friday in protest against the digital procurement system (online schedule). Led by BKU activist Jagdip Singh Aulakh, they raised slogans against the BJP-JJP alliance government in the state, alleging that its agencies did not procure wheat of farmers who had brought their produce to the mandi. They also alleged that SMSs were being sent to farmers whose crop is not ready for harvesting instead of those whose crop has been harvested. Earlier in the morning, Bhupinder Singh, a farmer from Bijna village in Karnal district, reached the grain market with a wheat trolley. But mandi officials did not let him enter the grain market for several hours, telling him to follow the online schedule. They did not give him a gate pass as he had not received the SMS. Thereafter, protesting farmers unloaded the wheat stock outside the office of the mandi secretary and threatened to continue their protest till the government agencies start procurement. “I brought wheat grown on my three-acre land to the Karnal grain market but was not allowed to enter the mandi for several hours, despite having the registration for 450 quintals on ‘Meri Fasal Mera Bayora’ portal. My crop on 14 acre is ready for harvest but I did not get SMS,” said Bhupinder. He alleged the government was making false claims of having started procurement in all mandis of the state on April 1. “But there are no buyers in Karnal grain market and even the officials are not allowing us to enter the grain market,” he said. Jagdip Singh Aulakh, who is associated with BKU (Charuni), alleged that despite the government’s claims, not a single grain had been was procured in Karnal. He said six farmers had brought their produce to Indri grain market and four to Karnal on April 1. They are still waiting for the government agencies to procure their produce, he said. “We will not follow the government’s online schedule system and will bring our produce in mandis as per the old (traditional) system. The government has to procure it at the minimum support price. We will unload the produce outside the DC office on Saturday,” he added. Karnal ADC Veena Hooda also reached the mandi and tried to pacify the farmers, saying she will take up the issue with higher authorities to sort out this issue with the help of commission agents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-gate-pass-farmers-in-karnal-dump-stock-to-protest-new-mode/articleshow/81878097.cms||---

To encourage the citizens, I decided to launch the 10 per cent discount scheme,” said Kamlesh Shah, who owns a stationery shop near Rhino Circle. “Anyone producing the vaccination certificate will be given the discount on every product sold at our shop. I hope that other such businessmen in the city come up with such schemes to motivate people to go for the vaccination,” Shah, who has taken the first dose of the vaccine told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/take-vaccine-get-10-discount/articleshow/81877458.cms||---
---||Delhi||Indian varsities look at newer paths in legal edu||Greater Noida: In a world that technology, and the numerous connections it creates between people, places, communities and cultures, is bringing closer all the time, legal education too has become globalised and Indian universities must set benchmarks in tune with this reality. Legal experts on Saturday dissected the challenges and opportunities for educators at a conference on ‘Globalisation of Professional Legal Education’ that was organised by Bennett University’s School of Law that was flagged off by a panel discussion on integrating Indian legal education with the National Education Policy (NEP). Highlighting the difference between the Indian legal education system and that overseas, S Prabhakaran, senior advocate and co-chairman of the Bar Council of India, said, “One of the key challenges in integrating the global legal education system with that of India’s is that students getting law degrees abroad attend a three-year course, while in India, we offer a five-year law degree. When students return with law degrees from abroad, they have to bridge the two-year gap here with a set of examinations. So how we integrate foreign law degree holders in the Indian system needs attention. The other important factor is that students should get mandatory six-month to one-year internships before they are eligible for practice.” Leena Chandran Wadia, member of the NEP’s drafting committee, said the “shape of globalisation of legal education in India will be based on collaboration”. “NEP is very clear on what the future of education should look like, but the paths have to be created. In India, the globalisation of legal education will provide opportunities for collaboration, twinning and dual degrees between universities in India and those abroad,” Wadia said. Mehraj-ud-Din Mir, vice-chancellor of the Central University of Kashmir, said globalisation of legal education had already taken place. “The issue is what the challenges are that lie ahead. We are at the stage where we can monitor it and take care of retaining sovereignty of people at large. We must note the role of artificial intelligence and how it can change the legal profession. We can’t close our eyes to the ground realities of modern legal education. If we want to keep the flag of the Indian legal system high, we must keep pace with global legal education,” he said. The session was also attended by several other academics, including Sudhanshu Varma, COO, Bennet University, MP Singh, research professor of law, Shridhar Acharyulu, professor at the School of Law, Guljit Singh Chadda (retd) registrar, Bennet University, and Ashita Allamraju, associate professor, School of Law, among others. Prabhu Aggarwal, vice-Chancellor of Bennet University, said in his address, “I think this is a very timely topic, and I cannot but imagine the type of experts that are here today… professionals, educators, academics debating these very important topics from across the globe, not just India.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/indian-varsities-look-at-newer-paths-in-legal-edu/articleshow/81891686.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC notice over lack of waiting list for AMC post||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has issued notice to the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) and the state government, over a petition demanding that the civic body should prepare a waiting list for the posts of assistant municipal commissioner. Petitioner Sarang Modi filed the petition through advocate Anand Yagnik, challenging inaction on part of AMC in preparing a waiting list for the appointment for which the process was undertaken in 2019. The general administration department has issued a resolution mandating creation of 20% waitlisted candidates for appointments undertaken in state, which the civic body has not done, the petitioner submitted. The petitioner submitted that he would have been at the top of the waiting list but the appointment committee has failed to prepare a list for the post. At present, there are two vacancies for the post in AMC and one candidate selected was found ineligible after appointment, and therefore reverted back to his original post. Therefore,Modi, being the first in the waiting list, should be appointed on the post. Justice Ashutosh Shastri has issued notice to AMC and the government and sought reply by April 19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-notice-over-lack-of-waiting-list-for-amc-post/articleshow/81877396.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Papers of ambulance used to ferry Mukhtar Ansari fake, FIR filed||LUCKNOW/BARABANKI: The Barabanki Police on Friday lodged an FIR against the owner of the ambulance which was used to ferry jailed gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari from Ropar jail to Mohali court in Punjab on March 31. The FIR was lodged by additional road transport officer (ARTO), Barabanki, Pankaj Singh against Dr Alka Rai of Mau who has been accused of registering the vehicle using fake documents. Preliminary probe has revealed that the registration of the ambulance was done by Dr Rai from Barabanki on the basis of fake address proof. Police said the vehicle was attached to a hospital in Mau but was allegedly being used in Punjab to ferry Ansari from jail to court. In the FIR, Singh stated that a preliminary investigation was conducted after which it surfaced that the ambulance (UP 41 AT 7171) was registered on December 21, 2013 in the name of Dr Alka Rai and her address was mentioned as 56, Rafinagar in Barabanki. He said the ambulance was attached with Shyam Sanjeevni Hospital and Research Centre Pvt Ltd in Mau district. “The vehicle’s fitness and insurance has expired. Its fitness got expired on January 31, 2017 following which the transport department sent a notice to the owner on January 21, 2020 on the address registered in Barabanki,” said Singh. The ARTO said a letter was also dispatched to the sub-divisional magistrate, Nawabganj (Barabanki), to verify the address of Dr Alka Rai mentioned in her voter ID card. The SDM conducted a probe and found that house number 56 did not exist in Rafinagar. “The local corporator and neighbours also confirmed that no such house number exists in Rafinagar. Thereafter, I approached the Kotwali police station and lodged an FIR in this connection,” he said. “A case has been registered against Dr Alka Rai under charges of dishonesty, cheating by impersonation, forgery of valuable security, forgery for purpose of cheating, and using a forged document as genuine,” superintendent of police, Barabanki, Yamuna Prasad told TOI. “We will conduct a probe to ascertain why the number used was of Barabanki district and how the registration was done on fake documents,” the SP added. Dr Alka Rai, who is the co-owner of the hospital and claims herself to be the general secretary of BJP women’s wing (Gorakhpur region), had on Thursday confirmed that papers were signed in 2013 on behalf of the hospital for the purchase of the ambulance. Doc alleges conspiracy, pleads for justice: Accusing her opponents of hatching a conspiracy to malign her image as a politician and a social worker, Dr Alka Rai on Friday said she had no knowledge about the ambulance registered in her name and never been to Barabanki in her life. Addressing media persons after an FIR was lodged against her on Friday, Dr Rai urged Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to ensure justice to her and said she was serving as a government doctor when the said incident took place. "I would like to ask why an FIR is being lodged against me on the basis of the version of a criminal? I am sure the Yogi Adityanath government will ensure justice to me," she said. In a letter addressed to the CM and senior administrative officials, she said the representatives of then MLA (Mukhtar Ansari) had taken her signature for an ambulance in the name of her hospital for social service. She claimed that she did not have any ambulance registered in her name.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/papers-of-ambulance-used-to-ferry-mukhtar-fake-fir-filed/articleshow/81879218.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

The Mumbai unit held an online executive committee meeting on Thursday evening where the resolution was passed. Kandivali MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar who moved a motion congratulating Fadnvavis said, “During the recent budget session the manner in which Fadnavis exposed the corruption in the government and its failures is highly appreciable.” Lodha then moved a resolution to fight the 2022 civic elections under his leadership. Fadnavis as CM had led the party in the 2017 BMC polls too. Though in an alliance with the Shiv Sena in the state, dispute over seat sharing had led the two parties to contest the BMC elections separately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/fadnavis-to-steer-bjp-in-2022-bmc-elections-in-mumbai/articleshow/81878105.cms||---

He expressed interest in her, but she refused. “Between December 2020 and March 2021, Dubey called her up from different numbers and demanded sexual favours. He also threatened to kill her and her family,” said senior inspector Dnyaneshwar Katkar of Dadar GRP. On March 29, when she was heading home from her Dadar workplace, Dubey called her again.

---||Ahmedabad||Roads in bad shape? Seek material sample under RTI||AHMEDABAD: Why did the newly laid road near your society crack and turn into rubble? If you are not satisfied with the civic work, can you seek samples of the material used in the roadwork and try to find answers yourself by approaching a government certified third-party testing lab ? In his latest order, state information commissioner Subhash Soni ordered the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) to provide a citizen samples from the fresh batch of materials used in an ongoing road construction project under the RTI Act within 15 days. The commission also went a step further and asked the AMC to provide the RTI applicant a copy of ‘test certificate’ against the material whose sample was provided to the citizen within 15 days. “Though ‘seeking samples, copy of test reports of civic works or inspection of on-site civic works’ comes under the purview of the RTI Act, not many citizens have exercised this right,” says Pankaj Bhatt, an applicant from Kalupur area of the city. Bhatt took advantage of the very first section of the RTI Act, which defines “Right to Information” as the right to “inspection of work, documents, records; taking notes, extracts or certified copies of documents or records and even taking certified samples of material.” Bhatt had approached the central zone office of the AMC on March 7 last year and sought inspection of road works in the zone, along with copy of the measurement book, details of payments made to the contractor, remarks made by the engineer at each stage of road work and deadline or schedule for the roadwork. “Under inspection I had sought samples of the raw material used for the civic works along with the copy of the test reports ,” says Bhatt. Two years ago, the central information commission (CIC) in Delhi — a body meant for central government departments — in a separate case had enforced preservation of material procurement bills by contractors, which earlier was returned back. The CIC had asked the public works department (PWD) to reveal these records under the RTI and even allowed the citizen to verify the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/roads-in-bad-shape-seek-material-sample-under-rti/articleshow/81877400.cms||---

---||Delhi||Covid safety: Delhi Metro books 7k in March||NEW DELHI: With a surge in Covid-19 cases in the capital, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), too, has intensified its drive against commuters violating Covid-safety norms. March saw DMRC’s flying squads issuing 7,058 fines, the highest in a month since Metro services restarted in September 2020 and more than half of these were issued in just one week’s time. The flying squads have been prosecuting 150-200 passengers a day for violating Covid norms, like not wearing masks properly, sitting on seats meant to be kept vacant or not maintaining social distancing at stations and inside trains. According to figures shared by DMRC, the number of challans started going up along with the increase in Covid-19 cases from March 23, when 234 people were penalised, followed by 318 challans issued on March 24 and 527 the next day. The figure reached a record high of 758 on March 26. Since then, the figure has remained above 600 till month-end — except 396 challans on March 28 and just 29 challans the next day, when train services started after 2.30pm on the occasion of Holi. The corporation had penalised 3,373 violators till March 24 and in the next seven days, it penalised 3,685 more taking the total figure to 7,058, an increase of one and a half times compared with the 2,805 challans issued in February. It has also strictly reinforced social distancing norms in view of the fourth wave of Covid-19 cases that the capital is witnessing and has advised passengers to plan their journey in advance and allow for additional time of 20-30 minutes for their commute. While waiting in queues to enter metro stations, passengers are now required to wait on marked social distancing circles or stripes and DMRC has said that it if it is found that the distancing is not followed at stations, entry gates will be closed at those stations, till the distancing is ensured. According to the existing Covid-safety protocol, it is mandatory for all the passengers to enter the station after thermal screening, hand sanitisation, with face properly covered with a mask and following social distancing on Metro premises throughout their journey. After being shut down for 169 days last year due to the Covid-19 outbreak, train services resumed from September 7 and despite taking measures to create awareness about Covid appropriate behaviour, it was clear that many passengers were violating norms and from September 11, DMRC deployed its flying squads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-safety-metro-books-7k-in-march/articleshow/81878101.cms||Sidharatha Roy

For the first time, farmers are to be notified on SMS about selling their crops. Officials claimed that all arrangements had been made to implement the new system but mismanagement was visible right at the outset. Only one farmer was issued gate pass for 338 quintals to sell the crop in the Jind grain market on Friday while other farmers sought to reschedule . Anil Kumar, a farmer from Jind, said, “I got a message from headquarters and was asked to bring the crop the same day, which was not possible. A major chunk of farmers in the village don’t have tractor trolleys, don’t get harvesting machines on time and even face labour crunch. Therefore, its not an easy task to bring crops at such short notice.” Jind grain market secretary Sanjiv Jangra said farmers have the option to reschedule on the official website.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/in-jind-of-78-to-get-sms-only-1-sells/articleshow/81878098.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Start more L2, L3 hospitals in high-burden districts, says Uttar Pradesh CM||LUCKNOW: With coronavirus cases spiralling in Uttar Pradesh, chief minister Yogi Adityanath has directed officials to make a higher number of level 2 and level 3 hospitals functional in the state, with varying facilities for Covid treatment, many of which had been discontinued when cases had started declining. The CM said these hospitals should be started especially in districts where caseload is high, such as Lucknow, Kanour, Meerut, Varanasi, Prayagraj, Ghaziabad and Agra. Anticipating a return of people to villages due to the panchayat polls, and as rural areas are throwing up about 50% of the total cases being reported from the state, Yogi said that ‘nigrani committees’ should be activated to keep a check on those who are returning and on home isolation cases. The number of active cases in Lucknow on Friday was 4,587, Kanpur Nagar 599, Meerut 451, Varanasi 954, Prayagraj 871, Ghaziabad 355 and Agra 175 cases. The state’s strategy for the time being will be on testing, tracking and treatment. Those who are in home isolation will have to be monitored continuously so that fatalities may be decreased. Nigrani committees, set up in rural areas, are being reactivated to keep a check on those people returning to UP from other states for panchayat elections, festivals or other reasons. They will also help in monitoring patients in home quarantine. The CM helpline will be used proactively to keep a check on patients who are in home quarantine. Public address systems will be used to create awareness among the people about the coronavirus and ways of protecting oneself from it. This would include messages on wearing of masks, proper sanitisation and maintaining social distancing. The CM ordered strict action against anyone caught without a mask in public places. All district magistrates and chief medical officers have been directed to hold daily meetings at the integrated command and control centres to review daily Covid-19 conditions in their areas and to prepare containment strategies accordingly. The chief minister’s office will take daily reports of these meetings. With vaccination having started for persons above 45 years, Yogi said that efforts should be made to increase the pace of vaccinations in the state and to, at all cost, drastically reduce vaccine wastage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/start-more-l2-l3-hospitals-in-high-burden-dists-says-cm-yogi/articleshow/81879348.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Kochi||‘Ensure Covid protocol even after shots’||Kochi: Amid instances of healthcare workers (HCWs) in the state getting Covid infection, even after receiving two doses of Covid vaccines, the state health department has asked everyone to ensure adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour even after vaccination. “Individuals who have been administered Covid vaccines are also advised to strictly adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour, irrespective of the number of doses or time after vaccination,” said a government advisory by principal health secretary Dr Rajan Khobragade. Though it’s known that one must adhere to ‘Break the Chain’ — like wearing a mask, maintaining physical distance, frequent hand hygiene, cough and sneeze hygiene — at all times, especially in public places even after vaccination, health experts admit that many, including HCWs, were found to have become careless after vaccination. “Vaccination shouldn’t instil overconfidence amongst people, including HCWs. A person after two doses of vaccination may take two weeks or even more to develop immunity. During this period they can get Covid infection and carry it for a short period, spreading to others, without their knowledge,” said Dr Jayakrishnan AV, chairman, Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) committee for vaccination promotion and coordination. The exact number of HCWs in the state who have got Covid infection even after two doses of vaccination has not yet been released by the government. However, health experts said that the numbers are low. In Kasaragod, samples were collected of about 400 HCWs, who received two doses of vaccine, and 13 of them tested positive. In a 500-bed hospital in Ernakulam, about 10 HCWs tested positive after two doses of vaccination. However, majority of them had no symptoms and a few had mild symptoms. Nobody needed hospitalisation. Dr Rajeev Jayadevan, lead researcher of IMA-Kochi’s national survey on post-vaccination symptoms and experiences of HCWs in India, explaining the chances of getting Covid-19 after being fully vaccinated said that as per data from the US it was 1 in 12,000 in the first three-and-half months and the chance of death was 1 in 6 lakh persons. “Vaccines are the key as they protect to a very high degree. Even those fully vaccinated can get Covid but these numbers will be much lower than the infection rate amongst non-vaccinated people. Also, we have seen that in most cases, the infected HCWs were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms,” Dr Jayadevan added. A HCW who got infected after two doses of the vaccine said, “After being vaccinated I got overconfident. From being extremely careful pre-vaccination, I let my guard down post-vaccination and got infected. Though I had a high viral load, my symptoms were not severe. One needs to be extremely careful even after vaccination.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ensure-covid-protocol-even-after-shots/articleshow/81876633.cms||Preetu Nair
---||Delhi||AAP, BJP engage in war of words over hike in parking rate||New Delhi: AAP MLA Atishi on Saturday slammed the BJP over South Delhi Municipal Corporation standing committee proposing to increase the surface-level parking rates by 100%, that is from Rs 20 per hour to Rs 40 per hour. In a press conference, Atishi claimed that ahead of the 2022 municipal elections, the BJP-led municipal corporation was pulling all the strings to rob the hard-earned money of the citizens of Delhi.“The standing committee of SDMC has released a proposal to increase the surface parking rates by an appalling rate of 100%. This means, when people like us visit any marketplaces, malls, or metro stations, with our vehicles and wish to park them, we will have to pay double than that of the existing parking rates if this is notified and approved. The municipal corporation is responsible for making such decisions,” Atishi said.She said that the decision would directly affect those living in all the areas of South Delhi, or the ones visiting from other districts for various purposes. “This is the 10th time within one year that SDMC has come up with a proposal to increase surface-level parking rates by an astounding rate of 100%. This is because BJP is well-aware of the fact that it won’t be able to win the elections of 2022. This is the last year that they can rule and indulge in such corrupt practices. Hence, they have decided that let’s cheat the people as much as we can, increase taxes as much as we can, and malign the people of Delhi. After the next civic polls, they won’t be able to indulge in such corrupt practices,” she said.AAP demanded SDMC to repeal this recommendation of increasing surface parking rate. “We want them to take back this recommendation, and SDMC must not approve the proposal that is extremely upsetting for the people of Delhi,” she said.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that Atishi was misleading the public. “Parking charges have not been increased in general by SDMC. A multi-level parking has been constructed by SDMC near Green Park Market and to encourage its use, the rates of parking on Green Park road have been increased, that too, as per the SC’s directive.” Kapoor said that parking on roads was a menace in Delhi, which apart from creating jams often caused street fights. “To end these problems, the corporations despite financial constraints are working on plans to construct more multi-level parking facilities,” Kapoor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-bjp-engage-in-war-of-words-over-hike-in-parking-rate/articleshow/81890928.cms||---

She got home, collapsed at the gate, named her rapist and, within hours, died. Police, however, said the death by poisoning could have been a case of suicide. “My sister told me she had left for her tuition around 3.30pm. Her class was from 4pm to 5pm. Around 5.15pm, she got home … When she reached the main gate of the house, she collapsed. Her chacha (paternal uncle) called out to her mother for help,” her maternal uncle said on Friday. “She had been poisoned.” She gave her mother a name, Lakhan, and said he and three of his friends gangraped her — she did not know his friends but could identify all four of them if they came before her — after which she fell unconscious. “We rushed her to the hospital, where the doctors declared her dead,” the uncle said in his complaint to the police, on the basis of which an FIR was lodged against Lakhan, 18, and an unidentified person under the Pocso Act, and for gangrape, murder and poisoning. Police, however, said a four-line suicide note had been found at the girl’s house. In the note, she accused “a tuition batchmate and his friends” of raping her and said that had forced her to kill herself. “Prima facie, the handwriting in the suicide note matches that of the girl,” Meerut SP (rural) Keshav Kumar said. The family refuted this. “No suicide note was found at the house. The pradhan was here. Some 100-200 people had gathered at the house and no one told us about any suicide note then. This is not true. It is a case of gang-rape and murder,” the maternal uncle said. Lakhan and one of his friends have been arrested. “Further action will be taken if more names come up during the investigation,” Kumar said.

---||Chandigarh||Haryana starts buying wheat at 500 centres||Chandigarh: Wheat procurement has started in about 500 procurement centres in Haryana and the state government expects to procure over 80 lakh tonnes of wheat this time. Explaining the procurement process, Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala said when a farmer visits the procurement centre to sell his crop, he will get a J-form. Within 40 hours, the farmer will get payment for his crop. If the farmer is not paid within 72 hours, the government will pay 9% interest on the amount. Dushyant was talking to media persons after inaugurating the newly-constructed four-lane flyover near Gurgaon-Faridabad Road near Bandhwari village in Gurgaon. He said this time, six crops were being procured at minimum support price (MSP). Assuring farmers that all the wheat and mustard crop would be procured, the deputy CM said the state government had made extensive provisions for procurement. For the first time, government procurement agencies have started purchasing wheat and mustard from April 1. The deputy CM said farmers were getting good prices in the open market for mustard and it was reported that in open market, mustard was being procured for Rs 5,200 to Rs 5,400 per quintal. Chautala said strict action would be taken against officials concerned if any irregularity was found in the procurement process. He informed that an option had been given to farmers, under which 50% of them would be called by the government and 20%, could register themselves. Tokens would also be issued to such farmers. Besides, arhtiyas had also been authorised to call 30% of farmers to procurement centres, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-starts-buying-wheat-at-500-centres/articleshow/81878103.cms||---

We are confident that they will go a long way in reforming the liquor trade in Delhi, enhance government revenues and most importantly provide for a better consumer experience,” said Mukesh Kumar, chairman, SCAI. Kumar said the new policy would ease business experience for the industries, including restaurants and pubs, which form a key part of the shopping centres in the country. “We are confident these reforms will become an example for the other states. Measures such as lowering the legal drinking age will also go a long way in ensuring illegal sale and consumption of liquor is brought under control, especially in Delhi, which shares porous borders with neighbouring Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. It will also help in improve the state’s overall revenue from the trade,” Kumar said, adding that the decision to allow bars to open under the new policy would transform the nightlife in the capital. SCAI is a non-profit organisation set up with the vision to engage and encourage development of shopping centres in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/shopping-centre-body-supports-excise-policy/articleshow/81891690.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The vaccination continues till 9pm. Only three minor adverse events were reported.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and his family received the vaccine at Maulana Azad Medical College. “It is my humble appeal to all the citizens of Delhi who are over the age of 45 to get vaccinated. It is the only way for us to fight the coronavirus,” said Sisodia.Sisodia also requested the central government to increase the supply of Covid vaccine to Delhi and open up vaccination to everyone, not just those aged 45 years and above. “We aim to vaccinate all the citizens of Delhi by May 4 once Delhi government received adequate vaccine doses from the central government,” the deputy CM said.Nearly 46,000 people of those inoculated on Saturday were in the 45-59 age group, while 21,432 were above 60 years. Among those who got the jab were 3,131 frontline workers and 1,882 healthcare workers. While 8,565 individuals received the second shot, it was the first injection for 72,232 people.“Clearly, there is great enthusiasm among people to get their first vaccine shot, perhaps due to the rising Covid cases,” noted an official. “People aged 45-59 are mostly occupied with their jobs on weekdays. They came out in large number on Saturday and will likely do so again on Sunday.”Only 52,408 people had been inoculated till 6pm on Friday. By 9pm, 60,376 people had been vaccinated, a little lower than the 70,000 who got the shot on Thursday by the same time.The smoother registration process has also helped. In any case, walk-ins are outnumbering the registered beneficiaries, and the vaccination centres take little time in registering those arriving without registering for the jab.“It was all smooth and painless,” smiled Ghanshyam Sharma, 65, at Lok Nayak Hospital. “I had apprehensions about the getting the vaccine, but it was totally painless and took only few minutes from verification of the registration to getting the injection.”The government has earmarked 3pm to 9pm time for walk-in vaccination, but depending on how busy the vaccination centres are, they are being inoculated even earlier. “We give priority to scheduled individuals before 3pm, though walk-ins can take the shot if there are no more scheduled applicants,” revealed a government hospital official.The vaccination began in January with healthcare workers. Since the first week of February, frontline workers have been getting the shots. People above 60 years and those above 45 with comorbidities were allowed to receive the vaccine before the government permitted those aged 45-59 to take the shots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/at-80797-daily-vaccination-hits-a-high-sisodia-urges-all-to-line-up/articleshow/81890938.cms||AlokKNMishra

The party had earlier been raking up high electricity rates in the state. Addressing media here on Thursday, Chadha said the Congress government was trying to copy AAP government’s initiatives in Delhi. He added that private buses plied on 70% routes in the state and the free travel scheme was only applicable to government-run buses, so the purpose of free travel was defeated. Earlier, in Jalandhar, Chadha announced that his party will launch an agitation from April 7 against rising power prices in Punjab to force chief minister Amarinder Singh’s government to provide free power to people of Punjab, on the lines of Delhi. Chadha showed the bills of people in Delhi and electricity bills in Punjab, pointing out the difference in tariff. In case the consumption was 220 units, the bill was almost zero in Delhi, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/aap-slams-pbs-free-bus-travel-for-women/articleshow/81878109.cms||---
---||Delhi||2 FIRs registered against head priest over his comment||New Delhi: Two FIRs were registered against Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati, head priest of Dasna Devi Temple, one in Delhi and the other in Mumbai, for some objectionable comments he made at a press conference at Press Club of India in New Delhi. Delhi Police lodged the FIR after taking suo motu cognisance of a video of the press conference that went viral on social media. “An FIR was registered at the Parliament Street police station and investigation is under way,” said Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal on Saturday. Police invoked the Indian Penal Code sections 153-A (promoting enmity between groups on religious grounds) and 295-A (deliberate and malicious act intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs). The cops will question Press Club officials about the details of the meeting that apparently took place in the first week of March. Anand Sahay of the club later said, “The Press Club is not responsible for remarks made by someone at a press conference.” Dasna Devi Temple had recently been in the news for an incident involving a minor Muslim boy who was caught drinking water there. While the purported video is being sent to a forensic lab to rule out tampering, Delhi Police is looking into an allegedly provocative tweet by Aam Aadmi Party MLA Amanatullah Khan against the temple priest’s comments. Khan also filed a complaint against the priest at Jamia Nagar police station. His tweet evoked sharp criticism from Delhi BJP leaders. In Mumbai, after Saraswati’s video went viral, Tahafuzz-e-Namoos-e-Risalat Board president Moin Ashaf Qadri and Raza Academy general secretary Saeed Noorie met Mumbai’s guardian minister Aslam Shaikh. The minister said, “I immediately spoke to city police commissioner Hemant Nagrale about the issue, and the commissioner ordered the Pydhonie police to file an FIR,” said Shaikh. On a complaint filed by Raza Academy member Irfan Abubakar Shaikh, the FIR was filed under IPC sections 295A and 153A, as in Delhi, while additionally invoking Section 505(2) (statements creating enmity). Qadri called upon community members to maintain restraint, and said legal recourse alone was the way forward. “All peace-loving citizens of India must unite against hateful statements. We are against all objectionable comment about any dharma guru and spiritual leader of any religion,” Qadri said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-firs-registered-against-head-priest-over-his-comment/articleshow/81891696.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: More centres, 7-days-a-week tests to speed up Covid vaccination||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Municipal Corporation is increasing the number of vaccination sites from 80 to 100 and ramping up the daily vaccination target from 10,000 to 12,000 as it goes into an overdrive to inoculate citizens and slow down the second wave. Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC), though, won't be able to ramp up vaccination sites for want of infrastructure and manpower. However, urban primary health centres in Kolkata, Bidhannagar and Howrah will be open all seven days for vaccination beginning this Sunday. Till now, vaccination was being carried out at these units between Monday and Saturday. The KMC has also decided to increase the number of trained health workers at the civic body-run vaccination centres that are witnessing a heavy rush. According to a KMC senior official, the civic body’s health department will conduct a survey of its existing 80 vaccination sites and reschedule its drive according to the footfalls of the beneficiaries. “We have decided to increase the number of our vaccination sites to bring more beneficiaries under the vaccination net. But before that, we need to re-allocate manpower from the sites that have low footfall to those that have higher demand. Similarly, we will also increase the quota of vaccines to the centres, where beneficiaries are queuing up in large numbers,” said the KMC official. At present, there is no dearth of vaccines for the KMC-run centres. According to the official, a surge of recipients was seen at the vaccination centres in Hatibagan, Raja Dinendra Street, Bidhan Sarani, College Street, Behala, Tollygunge, Baghajatin, Jadavpur, Kasba, Chetla, Garia from Thursday after 45+ citizens were added to the list of beneficiaries. Compared to the KMC, the BMC and HMC are struggling to meet vaccination demands that are likely to soar in the days to come. While the BMC is running 10 such centres across Salt Lake and Rajarhat areas, including three civic body run hospitals, the HMC is left with the choice of running seven vaccination centres within its limited scope for want of infrastructure and manpower. On Thursday, about 775 people got inoculated at the BMC-run health centres while the number of beneficiaries recorded by the HMC-run vaccination centres stood at 700. “The civic health workers are already under much pressure. Apart from the ongoing Covid vaccination drive, we are simultaneously running the routine vaccination programme for the children in the urban primary health centres,” said a BMC health department official. A senior HMC health department official lamented that though the vaccination count was on the rise, it was still way short of the demand. “We need to search for government buildings that can be converted into new vaccination sites,” said a HMC official.

The panchayat has so far given first dose of vaccine to 99.5% of people aged 60 years and above, while many other local bodies are lagging. To reach out to the elderly people and bring them to vaccination centres and hospitals for the first dose, the local body and health workers roped in school teachers and students for the registration, a difficult task for the aged, especially in rural areas. “The medical officer in our area said many people who came for vaccination returned without it due to lack of registration. We roped in school teachers and students to do spot registration at seven camps held on seven days. Laptops used in schools were brought to the camps and health department provided uninterrupted internet supply for the registration process. The panchayat has around 6,000 elderly people. Besides the ones attending our camps and government hospital here, many approached private hospitals too. We need to vaccinate the bedridden patients. We plan to inoculate them with the help of palliative care workers,” said Varapuzha panchayat president Kochurani Joseph. Besides Varapuzha, Piravom municipality and Karumalloor panchayat also clocked inoculation of more than 95% elderly people, with first dose. “As per field reports, 10 local bodies registered more than 90% vaccination of elderly so far. We give targets to medical officers regarding vaccination. Ernakulam district gave 4.60 lakh vaccine doses so far,” said Dr M G Sivadas, nodal officer for Covid vaccination. Piravom municipality, with around 9,300 elderly people, also did well in Covid vaccination, thanks to three mass camps the local body held with health workers at a school. “Our target was 1,000 per day at the camp. We got more than 700 people on the first, above 800 on the second day and 908 on the third day. Our plan was to ensure participation of around 35 elderly people from each of the 27 divisions every day at the camp and we asked councillors to identify the elderly,” said a health officer in Piravom. With schools having reopened for 10th standard and above, the local body needs to identify another school to cover the remaining elderly people in the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/over-99-elderly-given-first-dose-vaccine-in-varapuzha/articleshow/81876642.cms||T C Sreemol

However, India’s position remains nuanced with the government having also called for engagement with Myanmar and for the situation to be resolved through dialogue. While India was among eight countries to send a representative to the Myanmar Armed Forces Day parade, Bagchi said not too much should be read into it as India had an embassy there with the ambassador and defence attache performing their duties. Meanwhile, Myanmar refused to accept a 14-year-old Rohingya girl when she was taken to the border in Manipur for deportation, officials said. Immigration officials of Myanmar said the check-gate is shut for the last one year due to the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-calls-for-talks-to-restore-democracy-in-myanmar/articleshow/81880564.cms||---

All the persons in the car were crushed under the weight of the container. The deceased are Ashwini Kumar Dave, a principal in a private school, his wife Rashmi Devi, Buddharam Prajapat and Manoj Kumar. While the former three victims belonged to Jodhpur, Manoj belonged to Jalore and was posted in the treasury office in Ajmer. All of them had set out from Jodhpur early morning to attend a condolence meet of a relative in Ahmedabad. SP (Pali) Kalu Ram Rawat said both the vehicles were running parallel when suddenly the truck carrying two stone containers suddenly lost balance and one container slipping from its base, fell on the car. The car got completely crushed under the container. According to information, the car had been heading to Ahmedabad. When it reached near Balrai under Guda Endla police station on Pali-Sirohi highway at about 8.45am, a truck carrying a stone container coming from behind, tried to overtake the car. But suddenly seeing a vehicle coming from the opposite direction, the driver of the truck lost balance, which caused the heavy containers to displace from their foundation. One of the containers fell on the other side of the truck while the other one fell on the car running parallel to the truck. Locals rushed to the spot and informed police, which called in earth moving machines to remove the heavy container from over the car. By the time the container was removed, all the passengers had succumbed. Rawat said the bodies of the victims were handed over to the family members and a hunt has been launched to arrest the truck driver, who fled the spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/4-die-as-stone-laden-container-falls-on-car/articleshow/81878126.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Protests erupt in Telangana after jobless tribal kills self||WARANGAL/HYDERABAD: The issue of unemployment, especially among educated youth, came back to haunt TRS government after a 28-year-old jobless tribal man died by suicide on Friday. The death led to protests by student bodies and sharp reactions from opposition parties. Boda Sunil Naik drank a poisonous substance inside the Kakatiya University campus at Warangal on March 26 and recorded a selfie video stating that he was killing himself because the state government had not issued job notifications. He had shared the video with his friends on social media. After seeing the viral video, police had rushed to the campus and shifted him to a hospital. “Many students in Telangana are struggling because of missing employment opportunities,” Sunil had said in his video. “In 2016, I cleared SI and constable exams, but I was not shortlisted for not meeting the height requirement. I have been preparing for competitive exams, but in seven years, no job notifications were issued by the government. So, I have consumed poison. If I survive I will fight with the unemployed youth of Telangana. Otherwise, all of you have to fight for employment.” A native of Tejawat Ramsingh Thanda of Gundenga village in Mahabubabad district, Sunil had been staying at Hanamkonda to prepare for competitive exams. He died while being treated at NIMS hospital. When Sunil’s body reached his hamlet on Friday evening, Mahabubabad police made elaborate arrangements to prevent violence or protests. However, hundreds of people from neighbouring hamlets gathered at Tejawat Ramsingh Thanda and refused to let the body out of the ambulance, demanding that the government issue job notifications. Till late evening, the protesters had not allowed the last rites to be completed. As news of Sunil’s death spread, protests erupted at Warangal and Hyderabad. Unemployment had become a key campaign issue during the recently concluded legislative council elections and the death seemed to fan the existing resentment. Representatives of various student unions staged a protest near state minister E Dayakar Rao’s house in Hanamkonda alleging that the state government was responsible for the suicide and that it should take care of Sunil’s family. Police took the protesters into preventive custody. Sunil’s parents, Ramdhan and Malluka, fell unconscious when they were informed about the death. Upset relatives and well-wishers of the family then organised a ‘rasta roko’ at Gundega village. Student union representatives also protested at the Gandhi Hospital mortuary where Sunil’s body was kept before it was shifted to his hamlet. “We have taken 25 protesters into preventive custody and released them later on personal bond,” Gopalapuram ACP P Venkata Ramana said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/protests-erupt-in-t-after-jobless-tribal-kills-self/articleshow/81879432.cms||Shiva Kumar Pinna
---||Mumbai||Woman with Waze at SoBo 5-star detained||MUMBAI: The National Investigation Agency on Thursday evening detained a woman who was seen on CCTV cameras with API Sachin Waze leaving a five-star hotel in south Mumbai before the controversy over the car explosives case broke out. The NIA carried out searches at the Mira Road flat of the woman and she was being questioned there till the time of going to press, officials said. The woman (name withheld) had been working to “whitewash” Waze’s black money, NIA officials said. She did this by using two IDs, and she had the note-counting machine that was found in Waze’s Mercedes last month. NIA also searched a hotel-cum-club at Babulnath and claimed to have recovered documents related to the eight SIM cards used by Waze. The eight SIM cards were allegedly used in the case of murder of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran, whose Scorpio was found with explosives outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25. Sources said the person who ran the establishment employed one of the accused in the case, Naresh Gor, on Waze’s instructions. Officials said that Waze had instructed Naresh to procure SIM cards for his personal use. Gor procured the SIM cards from Gujarat and they were handed over to Waze through co-accused constable Vinayak Shinde, officials said. One of the cards was used to call Hiran on March 4 night saying Tawde wanted to meet him. Hiran stepped out and the next day, his body was found floating in a creek in Mumbra. Meanwhile, the NIA has found CCTV footage of the Bandra-Worli Sea link where Waze and Shinde are seen moving in a black Audi on March 2. Shinde was at the wheel and got into an argument at the toll naka. This video is of March 2, at around 6.56pm, after Waze held a meeting with his two colleagues, including a senior police officer, at the police headquarters at Crawford Market. The meeting went on between 4.30pm and 6pm. The meeting assumes significance as on the same day, a lawyer drafted a complaint alleging harassment on behalf of Hiran at Waze’s behest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/woman-with-waze-at-sobo-5-star-detained/articleshow/81865155.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Delhi||No plans for lockdown, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal urges Centre to allow vax for all||NEW DELHI: Laying to rest all rumours about the possibility of a lockdown being imposed in Delhi, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday announced that no curbs would be put in place. He added that the fourth Covid-19 wave was less serious than the previous ones, mortality rate was comparatively lower, and the number of people being admitted into hospitals and ICUs was also low. “We are keeping an eye on the situation. However, if we find a need for imposing a lockdown in the near future, the decision will only be taken after consulting the public. The government has started random testing at the airport, railway stations and bus terminals to screen people traveling to Delhi from states that have witnessed a spike in Covid-19 cases,” said Kejriwal. After reviewing the situation with health minister Satyendar Jain and senior officials from the health, revenue and other departments, the CM urged the central government to throw open vaccination for everyone instead of keeping it restricted to specific age groups. Apart from working out a detailed action plan, the provisions of beds, ambulances, hospitals, ventilators, oxygen and ICUs were reviewed in the meeting. Their expansion was planned for a possible rise in the number of cases. “For the country, this might be the second wave, but for Delhi it is the fourth Covid-19 wave. Cases are rising exponentially and it is a matter of grave concern. But no one needs to worry as all mandatory steps are being taken,” said Kejriwal. In October 2020, when Delhi was reporting 3,000-4,000 cases daily, around 1,700 patients were admitted in ICUs. “Now, around 800 are admitted in ICUs, which is 50% less. Earlier, 40 cases were being reported daily, but now it is 10-12. Fewer patients need to be hospitalised now and most of them are being treated efficiently under home isolation,” said the CM. “The government has put emphasis on testing, tracing and isolation, effective hospital management and greater vaccination coverage to check the spread of the infection. Wherever there seems to be a need for demarcation of containment zones, it is being done. However, the government will play a very limited role in this. The most important role is that of the public,” the CM said, urging people to strictly follow all Covid protocols, especially wearing masks, hand hygiene and social distancing. Underlining the importance of vaccination, Kejriwal said, “Vaccination is one of the key focus areas in Delhi in the fight against Covid-19. On Thursday, 71,000 people were vaccinated. Our capacity is now 96,000. Only four people had minor reactions and that, too, went away within 2-3 hours. This proves that the vaccine is safe. The CM added that under the central government guidelines, vaccination was only permitted in hospitals and health facilities. “Delhi government can create hundreds and thousands of facilities in community centres, schools, etc and a mass vaccination drive can be initiated if the central government permits it,” he said. “Adequate measures like provision of ambulance, first aid, etc can be done. The Centre should allow states to vaccinate everyone on a war-footing. There is a need to involve non-healthcare facilities in the inoculation drive. If non-healthcare facilities are not allowed to vaccinate people, then Delhi might not be able to vaccinate people beyond a certain number,” said Kejriwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-plans-for-lockdown-kejriwal-urges-centre-to-allow-vax-for-all/articleshow/81878144.cms||AlokKNMishra

On a direction by the state department of local bodies, the municipal council Jhalawar and municipality Jhalrapatan last week invited tenders for vaccination and sterilisation of street dogs in the two cities, but no firm turned up for the work till last date on Thursday, executive officer of Jhalrapatan municipality Ruhi Tarannum, who also holds additional charge of Jhalawar municipal council, said. The tender for the vaccination and sterilisation of street dogs was worth Rs 30 lakh and carried government price of Rs 1,200 for vaccination and sterilisation of a street dog and the firm doing the job was to tag the dog and submit the bill with its tagged photo, she added. The DLB’s direction for the vaccination and sterilisation of street dogs in the periphery of municipality is aimed at curbing their menace in the residential localities and to protect people from unwanted infection from them, the EO said, adding unfortunately no firm turned up for the job in Jhalawar as well as in Jhalrapatan. The tender for the same job was floated two times in the past in the district, but no firm came up forward then too, she added. Locals in Jhalrapatan and Jhalawar are fed up of the street dog menace, chairman of Jhalrapatan municipality Varsh Jain said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-co-turns-up-for-sterilisation-of-street-dogs-in-jhalawar-dist/articleshow/81878136.cms||---

Speaking to mediapersons in Kannur on Friday, he said that India has once again become the country with the largest number of Covid-19 cases being reported in a day. “The second wave of Covid-19 has started in other states. In Kerala too, the number of Covid-19 cases is not showing a decrease. So, we should be extra careful. As majority of the population has not contracted the disease in the state, there is a possibility of spread of the disease. We are planning to vaccinate maximum number of persons before the next wave of infection commences,” he said. Vijayan said that Kerala has become the state which has been administering vaccines at the highest rate in the country. “Maximum number of people should come forward to accept the vaccines before the spread of the disease increases any further,” he added. The chief minister had said on Sunday that 26 lakh persons have been vaccinated in the state, and that with the commencement of vaccinations to persons aged above 45 years from April 1 onward, 1.1 crore more persons will be administered vaccines. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/vaccination-for-maximum-number-of-people-before-second-wave-pinarayi/articleshow/81876677.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

They have been kept in the isolation ward created in the facilities that were earlier used to house executive programme students. Of those infected, five are women. There are 700 students in the Joka campus at present. They returned in December, saying that it was impossible to attend online classes from where they were lodged because of internet disruption. Though students are on campus, the classes are still being held online. With strict rules in place, students were not allowed to move out of the campus all this while for the fear of infection. However, some students had moved out of the campus during Holi and the administration fears that they might have contracted the virus then. The infected students are being treated by hospitals. At present, none of them has been hospitalised as they are receiving “home care”. Doctors on campus are monitoring their health.  “We are trying to trace the students who came in contact with the infected ones. These students are being tested. Thankfully, the ones who have been tested till now have turned out to be negative,” said Prashant Mishra, faculty and head of the Covid response team of the institute. Those in isolation are being monitored continuously and the institute has a system in place, which ensures that their daily needs are supplied to them on time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/15-iim-c-students-test-ve-for-covid/articleshow/81877468.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Nagpur||Highest-ever inoculation of 31,244 in single day in district||NAGPUR: Around 31,224 persons took the Covid-19 vaccine in the district on Friday. This was the highest-ever in a day since the programme began 77 days ago. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is reportedly left with two days of Covaxin stock. As per the data of the deputy director of health services (DDHS), 18,536 from the 45-59 age group took the jab on Day 2 in the district. Nearly 8,454 senior citizens above 60 years turned up. The growth rate on Friday was 43.26%. Almost 21,796 had taken the jab on the first day for the 45-plus category. In the last week, vaccination was less than 10,000. In all, 16,886 were administered the vaccine in rural areas which was higher compared to the city (14,358). The Zilla Parishad (ZP) has increased the number of centres from 145 to 155. The NMC has increased the number of centres from 83 to 86. The number of centres in the district is now 241, compared to 228 a day ago. All centres in the district were open on Friday despite it being a government holiday. The centre at Dr Ambedkar Hospital was closed in morning. After getting many complaints, NMC officials ensured that inoculation at the centre started from noon. The government had announced that all centres would remain open on all days till April 30 . The NMC plans to start another 75 centres. “There are around 12 lakh people in the 45-plus category in the district of which around 3 lakh have taken the jab. The remaining will be covered in the next 20 days. Teams from the revenue department and ZP are mobilizing people from villages. This has increased the number of vaccinations in the last two days,” divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar told TOI. On Friday, the NMC received 1.07 lakh doses of Covishield from the DDHS. The government is yet to send a fresh stock of Covaxin. According to NMC sources, there are no doses left in the store room. “Six centres offer Covaxin. They are left with less than 3,000 doses. The NMC has sought GMCH to give 500 doses to its two centres. Covishield will be given as the first dose and Covaxin the second in case fresh stock does not arrive,” sources said. The DDHS has promised to send Covaxin from adjoining districts. Fresh stock is also expected from the government by Tuesday. It is for the second time that the NMC is facing such a shortage. Last month, the DDHS arranged doses from Wardha, Gadchiroli and Nagpur rural. Some 45-plus people were in a dilemma after their online booking for Saturday at Viveka Hospital was cancelled. “The hospital was starting vaccination at noon but, now, it has decided to open at 9am from Saturday. The hospital added a new section in the Co-Win application on Friday and hence online registration got cancelled automatically. The hospital was not displayed in the list of centres on the application. Everything will be normal from Saturday,” NMC officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/highest-ever-inoculation-of-31244-in-single-day-in-dist/articleshow/81877491.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Writing well is a skill that needs to be honed and these children have been out of practice. We are making them write as much as we can,” said Seema Sapru, principal, Heritage School.  “With so much of WhatsApping, children have started writing “u” instead of you and “r” instead of are quite frequently. I am worried!” said TH Ireland, principal of St James School. Richard Gasper, head of St Augustine’s Day School, Kolkata, said their teachers are giving the students both verbal and written tasks. “We are giving children board exam-related test papers to solve within a stipulated time.

There have been as many as 34 officially-recorded forest fire incidents in Nainital division and in many cases, locals say, the fires are coming close to private properties especially large estates bordering jungles. Gauri Rana, who runs a camping site in Sattal area, said that last week, he witnessed a huge fire near his property. “These fires have been raging for several months. A few days ago, I saw a massive fire a few kilometres away from my camp. This is not even the peak season. If this continues, it will threaten our lives and livelihood,” Rana said. Sumit Sah, a resident of Nainital, said that of late, he has witnessed “countless forest fires” on his way to Haldwani and Bhowali near Nainital. “Even when you look out of your vehicle’s window, you can see the fires on the hills. Just a day earlier, there was a massive fire in the Hanumangarhi area which could be seen several kilometres away. In fact, in one instance I saw a fire near Kainchi Dham. With the help of others, I doused the flames,” he said. Residents say that they have written to the officials many times, but nothing much happened. Some even said that they will protest in front of the forest minister for immediate action. “Creating awareness and planning a long-term strategy is needed. The areas require urgent relief,” Neeta Rana, a local resident said. Forest department officials meanwhile said that they are taking all steps to bring these fires under control. “Though paucity of staff is an issue, we are working round the clock and are available on phone as well as on helpline for any assistance. Further, we will start a pine collection process in a few days and van praharis as well as self-help groups will be roped in to control the forest fires,” TR Biju Lal, Nainital DFO, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/forest-fires-coming-close-to-private-estates-in-nainital/articleshow/81876012.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Pune||Travel curbs will not affect people out for vax, says Rao||Pune: Divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao on Friday said the 6pm--6am travel curbs for seven days from Saturday would not affect citizens going out for the Covid-19 vaccination. He said if stopped by the authorities, citizens going out to get the Covid-19 vaccine needed to produce the slots booked on CoWIN. Though Rao not elaborate on the procedure for walk-in vaccination, a senior official in the administration said these citizens would also be allowed to proceed on stating the sites they would visit. Rao, who attended the Covid-19 review meeting, also announced a 100-day vaccination programme to ramp up the daily inoculation number to one lakh and, if the Centre allowed, also include citizens aged above 18 in the group of beneficiaries. “As of now, the Centre has allowed vaccine for people aged above 45. But with scaling up of the inoculation and availability of vaccines, the Centre is bound to allow the shield for people belonging to more age groups in the most affected districts,” he said. Rao said the administration would start preparing to vaccinate all above 18 years, which would take about three to four months. He said, “We have about 28 lakh people in the district aged above 45 years with and without comorbidities. If we start vaccinating about one lakh people a day, it will then take a month to vaccinate this age group.” Around 57,000 people were vaccinated in the district on Thursday. The administration aims at scaling the number up to 80,000 in the next two days and subsequently to one lakh a day. A total of 74 lakh people in the district needed to be inoculated by the government machinery, for which the administration has set a target of 100 days. Rao said the maximum bed availability would be ensured by April 5. “Beds are being acquired for this from private hospitals. More dedicated Covid hospitals are also being planned,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/travel-curbs-will-not-affect-people-out-for-vax-says-rao/articleshow/81877520.cms||Nisha Nambiar

They entered the water at VIP Pushkar ghat for a holy bath in the river when tragedy struck. The bodies were later retrieved by Nizamabad police. The deceased have been identified as Bobbili Srinivas (40), his sons Siddhartha (16) and Srikar (14), Jilakara Suresh (40) and his son Yogesh (16) and Dodla Raju (24). Another teenager Ravikanth (14) was rescued by locals. The deceased were residents of Yellammagutta and nearby areas. The Sriram Sagar Project (SRSP) is located in Pochampad village, some 210 km from Hyderabad. The incident took place when a group of 20 relatives reached the VIP ghat where a religious ceremony was organised for a two-year-old boy. After performing the ritual, some of the members in the group decided to take a holy dip in the Godavari. Srinivas, Siddhartha, Srikar, Suresh, Yogesh, Raju and Ravikanth ventured into the water. When everyone was taking the holy dip, Srikar, who had gone deep into the water, started drowning. When he raised an alarm, six others tried to rescue him. However, Srikar drowned and five others also met a watery grave. Luckily, a few locals managed to bring Ravikanth to the riverbank. Others in the group alerted cops, who deployed local swimmers. After searching for nearly one hour, bodies of the six victims were recovered.

---||Delhi||Delhi sees coolest April day in 12 years||NEW DELHI: While the mercury might have crossed the 41-degree mark last week, making it the warmest March day since 1945, Delhi recorded a cooler night than usual on Saturday. The minimum temperature was just 11.7 degrees Celsius—seven notches below normal for this time of the season. India Meteorological Department’s data shows this is the lowest April minimum since at least 2009. However, this cooling effect is expected to be temporary and the mercury may rise by 3-4 degrees Celsius in the next 48 hours. Delhi recorded a maximum of 35.5 degrees Celsius on Saturday, which was two degrees above normal. Met officials said it was likely to cross 36 degrees on Sunday and 38 degrees by Monday. “Strong winds touching up to 40 km/hr were being recorded for the last few days, causing a cooling effect. Cloudy skies were also recorded on Friday during the day, which led to a drop in temperature at night and on Saturday morning,” said an official. Lodhi Road was the coolest location in Delhi on Saturday with a minimum of 10.6 degrees Celsius. In comparison, the lowest minimum recorded in April 2020 was 14.4 degrees, while it was 16.2 degrees Celsius in 2019. The all-time low for April in Safdarjung is 10.7 degrees Celsius, which was recorded on April 2, 1965. In terms of the maximum, the lowest maximum temperature on Saturday was recorded in Mayur Vihar, at 33.4 degrees Celsius. “Wind speed has dropped and almost calm conditions will be seen over the next 48 hours. The maximum may cross 38 degrees and the minimum 15 degrees due to this,” said the met official. Delhi had recorded its warmest March day in 76 years on March 30, when the maximum touched 40.1 degrees Celsius—eight notches above normal. Air quality in the capital, meanwhile, has improved to the ‘moderate’ category with an overall Air Quality Index (AQI) of 159 recorded on Saturday. “The overall air quality is in the moderate category with PM 10 continuing as the lead pollutant, due to dominance of dust lifting under dry and warm environment. Surface wind speeds blowing from north and north-west direction have reduced, but the AQI is likely to stay in the ‘moderate’ to ‘poor’ category for the next three days,” said SAFAR, a body under the ministry of earth sciences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-sees-coolest-april-day-in-12-years/articleshow/81891732.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand CM acts, 80 lose minister-rank posts||DEHRADUN: CM Tirath Singh Rawat on Friday reversed another major decision of his predecessor Trivendra Singh Rawat by removing over 100 party functionaries who held posts in various government divisions. An office order signed by state chief secretary Om Prakash said that all those holding posts of directors, chairpersons and members of various boards, commissions and directorates in Uttarakhand — were being relieved with immediate effect. The order mentions that all those given these posts after March 18, 2017 — when the BJP government came to power — will no longer hold their positions. It adds that those holding constitutional posts (like heads of child rights commission, minority commission, subordinate services commission etc) have been excluded from the list. Sources said that around 110 BJP functionaries had been given the key postings out of which 80 enjoyed minister rank or minister of state rank. While the ruling party members have remained tight-lipped over the issue, sources said that CM Tirath Singh Rawat – who was found Covid-19-positive and would come out of self-isolation on April 6 – will meet state BJP chief Madan Kaushik and some senior leaders to discuss the new names that would be appointed to these posts. When contacted, agriculture minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal told TOI, “Change is constant in politics and the decision in this regard lies in the hand of the chief minister. Some serious thought must have gone behind taking the decision. It appears that some fresh faces and deserving members would be given a chance in the new list.” Political analyst Jay Singh Rawat meanwhile said that this was the first of its kind move in Uttarakhand where a CM has removed so many functionaries of his own party who were appointed by his predecessor. “When Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank replaced Major Genreal B C Khanduri (retd) as CM, he did not make much changes in these nominated positions as all those holding such posts were BJP members. When Harish Rawat replaced Vijay Bahuguna, he dropped Amrita Rawat – the wife of Satpal Maharaj – from his cabinet, but never have party members been dropped in bulk from such ranks,” said Rawat, adding that “it was a clear message that either things are not well at all in the BJP since so many party functionaries have been removed from the posts or Trivendra Rawat took decisions without consulting the party or the senior members.” “It also reflects that the ruling party wants to make some serious amendments before going into the 2022 polls.,” he added. Reacting to the development, state Congress vice-president Suryakant Dhasmana said, “Uttarakhand has got a new groom in the form of Tirath Rawat and he will have new members in his marriage party. The old groom (Trivendra) has been ousted and now it is the turn of his loyalists to go. However, such useless moves will not succeed in diverting the people from the issue of failures of the BJP government.” He further said that such appointments only added to the burden of the state exchequer. “Rather than indulging in such useless exercises, the CM needs to focus on development, which has been missing from the state for the last four years,” the Congress leader said. Among the prominent BJP members who were given either cabinet or minister of state rank were former MP Balraj Passi who was made the vice-chairman of Pratham Rajya Shetriya Jalagam Parishad and former MLA Jyoti Prasad Gairola, who was made vice-chairperson of Dwitya Rajya Shetriya Jalagam Parishad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/over-100-bjp-members-lose-minister-rank-posts-in-ukhand-as-cm-tirath-rawat-reverses-another-decision-of-predecessor-trivendra/articleshow/81876025.cms||Kautilya Singh

In an online interaction with Rahul Gandhi, former US ambassador Nicolas Burns said democracies were on a test if they had the self-confidence to defend their ideas of democracy against the “harsh vision being offered by China and Russia”. Interjecting, Rahul said, “I don’t hear anything from the US establishment. If you are saying ‘partnership of democracies’, what is your view on what is going on here? I fundamentally believe that America is a profound idea, the idea of freedom, the way it is encapsulated in your constitution, it’s a very powerful idea. But you have to defend that idea.

However, it is too early to predict how people would respond to the stringent curbs,” said Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director, Bharati hospital, one of the biggest vaccination centres in PMR. Nikhil Kulkarni, an IT professional, said, “There is a general impression among people that it is a partial or some sort of a lockdown. Officials should make this clear that it is not (a lockdown) by using social media or mass media tools like newspapers, radio and television.” Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, Pune Zilla Parishad, said Pune was doing exceptionally well in terms of vaccination. “We are not at all worried about the impact of the increased curbs on vaccination as restrictions are effective only between 6am and 6pm, while the vaccination takes place during the day. In fact, we are focussing on increasing the number of daily vaccination coverage in the next few days,” he said. PMC officials said though the overall vaccination was not going to be impacted, starting vaccination early in the day would be helpful. “The ideal time for vaccination is from early morning (7am) to afternoon (3pm) as against the current 9am and 5pm schedule. If this time is followed it will be beneficial for citizens,” said a senior official of PMC. Stock availability of vaccines at the hospital premises will play a key role in starting the vaccination early. Rajesh Patil, commissioner, PCMC, told TOI, “If need be, we will tweak the vaccination timings. But that will be decided after seeing the next two days of response.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-fear-drive-to-lose-pace-officials-disagree/articleshow/81877523.cms||Umesh Isalkar

More such inoculation drives will be conducted on various other industry’s premises in the next few days.”Patil said not only the employees of Tata Motors, but their family members were allowed take shot too. “We have covered 1,460 beneficiaries (employees and families) within two days of the vaccination drive,” he said.Another PCMC official said, “By using the firms’ medical infrastructure and adhering to government guidelines for vaccination, the PCMC is organizing vaccination camps for employees and their dependents in various organizations. We are also approaching Credai in our bid to vaccinate the construction/migrant workers. We will also reach out to workers from the unorganized sector in a phased manner. We will be approaching MIDCs to reach out to middle and small-scale industries.”Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “We have been told about Mission 100 days vaccination, wherein by June ,15 we have been assigned the task of completing at least first jab of the beneficiaries.

Mariamma Varkey is credited as a pioneer in teaching who, along with husband K S Varkey, transformed the education system in the UAE upon their migration from Kerala. They taught English to local Arab children and even counted royal family members of Dubai among their former students. Responding to the increased demand for an English-language education for the children of Indian expatriates, the Varkey family founded “Our Own English High School” in Dubai in 1968 to teach children of all nationalities and religions. “It is with great sadness that I announce the death of my mother, Mariamma. Though she may be gone, her spirit of peace and tolerance will live on within me always,” said Sunny Varkey, founder of GEMS Education and the Global Teacher Prize, inspired by his mother. “I am proud that the respect with which my mother and father were held was the inspiration for the Global Teacher Prize, which we set up to shine a spotlight on the work that teachers do every day to transform lives. I intend to continue to honour my mother’s great legacy by doing everything I can to ensure all the world’s children receive their birthright of a good education,” he said. He said his mother’s passion for teaching was driven by her belief that all children need to be nurtured and encouraged and was fondly known as Ammachi, meaning mother, among thousands of her employees. The school set up by the Varkeys was the seed that grew into the GEMS Education network, founded in 1980, now operating and managing over 250 schools globally. It was his mother’s passion for her profession and her wish to see all children, no matter their background, receive a quality education, that led Sunny Varkey to establish the annual $1-million Global Teacher Prize. The most recent winner of the Global Teacher Prize is Indian village teacher Ranjitsinh Disale, who has helped to transform girls’ education in his school in Maharashtra. He was selected from over 12,000 nominations and applications from over 140 countries around the world. “Mrs Varkey’s life, so wholly dedicated to teaching, is the perfect example of a life well-lived. She is a great role model to all of us who have the good fortune to take part in this most noble of professions,” said Disale. The Varkeys had moved to the UAE in 1959, at a time when the discovery of oil in Dubai began a significant influx of foreign workers, including many from the Indian subcontinent. agencies||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-teacher-who-inspired-global-teacher-prize-dies/articleshow/81876706.cms||---

All of them were rushed to a hospital where the woman was declared brought dead, while the kids survived,” said Ingit Pratap Singh, DCP (South-West). On Saturday, two cases were registered. The woman’s brother claimed that Sushil demanded dowry and harassed her, which pushed her to take the extreme step. The constable alleged that his wife tried to kill their two sons. Police said the constable was likely to be arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dowry-case-a-day-after-cop-wifes-suicide/articleshow/81891737.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The trio were tea stall owner Rutik Ghodke(21), Vikram Mote (21) and Sudhir Udar (25), all from Katraj. “The constable, Ganesh Kale, reached Shelarmala while patrolling. He spotted the suspects selling tea without wearing masks,” senior inspector Jagannath Kalaskar of Bharati Vidyapeeth police said. “Kale told the trio to pay fines of Rs500 each for not wearing masks. But the suspects picked up a dispute,” Kalaskar said. “Kale in his FIR said the suspects caught hold of his collar and neck and attacked him. After the suspects were taken into custody, they apologized and pleaded to not take action against them,” he said, adding that an FIR regarding attacking the policeman and disobedience was registered under the relevant sections of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/trio-abuse-attack-constable-arrested/articleshow/81877527.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Kochi||CB records Sandeep’s statement||T’puram/Kochi: After registering two cases against officers of enforcement directorate (ED), the crime branch (CB) team on Friday interrogated Sandeep Nair, one of the main accused in the gold smuggling case at Poojappura central prison in the capital. CB sources said that Nair said that he was asked by ED officers to name the chief minister in connection with the gold smuggling case. His statements were recorded by the CB officers. Early this week, crime branch had registered a second case against ED sleuths on the basis of complaint from Nair. Though it was originally said that the case was registered on the basis of the petition by Nair’s advocate to the state police chief, the lack of clarity in this regard remains after his advocate denied filing a petition before the police. Earlier, Nair had written a letter to Ernakulam district sessions judge, in which he had said that ED sleuths were forcing him to depose against the chief minister and the ministers. ED to move court against CB: Meanwhile in Kochi, ED said it will move Ernakulam Sessions Court seeking to cancel the permission given by the court to crime branch for questioning Nair in the cases registered by CB against ED. ED alleged that CB did not inform it about the petition seeking permission to question Nair, who is currently placed in judicial custody in a case registered by ED. The agency also said that CB wrongly convinced the court that it had informed ED about the petition to get permission. ED will file a petition in this regard on Saturday. Sources with ED said that CB’s hurried move to question Nair without informing the agency was an attempt to sabotage the investigation in the gold smuggling case. They also said that CB registered the FIRs in two cases against ED based on a letter sent by Nair to the sessions court judge. “The two cases registered by the CB were not based on any complaint by the accused Sandeep Nair. They registered the cases based on the letter he sent to a judge from jail. We got to know about CB securing permission to question Sandeep from newspapers and news channels. ED has already approached the high court against the cases and matter is sub-judice. We will challenge the court’s decision to grant permission to Sandeep as our side was not heard. Moreover, we were not even informed by CB that they want to question Sandeep,” said an ED officer. A special team from the Thiruvananthapuram crime unit is probing the cases registered against ED. The crime branch had earlier registered a case against ED officers who are probing the gold smuggling case on the basis of the statements of two woman civil police officers. Crime branch had charged the first case under IPC Sections 116, 120-B, 167, 192, 193 and 195-A for conspiracy, intimidation and forcing to give false statements against the chief minister. The state had received legal advice from the director general of prosecutions that a case should be registered against ED sleuths who had interrogated Swapna Suresh in jail. The government had sought legal advice on the basis of the report of the investigation team that had probed the leak of the voice clip of Swapna Suresh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cb-records-sandeeps-statement/articleshow/81876703.cms||---

On the brighter side, as many as 6,000 patients recovered in PMR on Friday. The PMC areas added 4,653 positive cases on Friday, followed by 2,463 cases in the Pimpri Chinchwad areas and 1,970 patients in the rural and cantonment pockets. The region’s tally of positive cases now stands above 5.51 lakh, while its recovery count at over 4,73 lakh. A report released by district health officer Bhagwan Pawar stated that the region’s tally of sample testing increased to 29.49 lakh on Friday evening. It said 58 patients succumbed to the infection in PMR on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/daily-cases-shoot-past-9000-as-tests-touch-33k/articleshow/81877525.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Mumbai||State ends financial year with revenues 28% below target in Mumbai||MUMBAI: The state has ended the financial year with its annual revenue 27.6% below the target set for the year, as the pandemic crushed economic activity and tax collection. Figures till March 31 show a gap of Rs 95,893 crore between the target and the actual revenue generated for 2020-21. Indeed, the revenue generated in 2020-21 was 11.6% lower than the state’s earnings in the previous year. The state’s revenue in 2019-20 was higher by Rs 33,160 crore compared to the pandemic year. The silver lining was that the revenue generated in March 2021 was higher than in March 2020 by Rs 8,190 crore. Indeed, at Rs 33,721 crore, the revenue generated in March 2021 was the highest in a single month in the financial year. Officials say this is the result of higher tax collections in the last month of the financial year and a larger chunk of payouts from the Centre, including GST compensation and the state’s share of central taxes. The latest data shows that the state generated revenue worth Rs 2.5 lakh crore during 2020-21 compared to a revenue target of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. The state’s collection of major taxes was 69% of the annual target, and non-tax revenue collection was 66.6% of the target. In 2019-20, the state’s collection of major taxes was 89.6% of the target and non-tax revenue was 85% of the target. However, the pandemic also affected the Centre’s tax collections resulting in lowered GST compensation and share of central taxes passed onto states. Maharashtra ended the financial year with a shortfall in GST compensation from the Centre worth Rs 28,833 crore. The Centre had also cut its tax transfers to states during the year, impacting revenue generation. The state received Rs 13,482 crore less in its share of central taxes compared to the original target. The state was expecting to receive Rs 48,109 crore, but ended up receiving Rs 34,627 crore by the end of the financial year. The state’s financial position remains bleak at the start of the new financial year. It’s debt is at an all-time high of Rs 6 lakh crore and it faces its highest-ever revenue deficit. The second Covid wave is also expected to hit sectors, including tourism and hospitality, which expect to generate business during the summer vacation. “Typically, there is not much revenue generation in the first month of the new financial year, but the tourism sector in particular sees a lot of activity, which will be affected by the rise in cases,” said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/state-ends-financial-year-with-revenues-28-below-target-in-mumbai/articleshow/81878158.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar
---||Dehradun||How will Uttarakhand govt comply with HC order of testing 50k per day in Haridwar? Only 10 govt, 12 pvt labs in state which can test maximum 35,000 RT-PCR samples||DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) earlier this week had asked the state government to ensure at least 50,000 samples are tested per day in Haridwar district during the Maha Kumbh but the infrastructural capacity of the state in terms of testing is far less. There are currently 10 government labs in the state which can collectively test a maximum of 9,700 samples per day. There are 12 private labs, which can conduct 1,000 to 1,500 tests daily. “Even if we deploy our entire machinery only for Haridwar, we won't be able to conduct 50,000 RT-PCR tests,” said a senior health department official. According to data accessed by TOI, the Government Doon Medical College (GDMC) has a maximum capacity of testing 2,200 samples while the Government Medical College in Haldwani can test 1,500 RT-PCR samples daily. The Government Medical College in Srinagar (Garhwal) can test 1,200 samples per day while the MRU Medical College in Haldwani and JLN hospital in Rudrapur have a testing capacity of 500 RT-PCR samples each day. ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute (ICAR-IVRI) and Almora Medical College have a maximum testing capacity of 300 samples per day while IIP in Dehradun can test 220 RT-PCR samples in a day. Dehradun’s biggest private pathology lab located at Astley Hall can test around 2,500 samples, its owner said. “The two labs in AIIMS-Rishikesh can collectively test around 3,000 samples but only when we have enough kits for testing,” said Harish Thapliyal, public relations officer at AIIMS. Dr Pankaj Singh, in-charge of the Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) under the Union ministry of health and family welfare, told TOI that among the 12 private labs, all have the capacity to test RT-PCR samples. “We do not have an exact idea about the testing capacity of private labs, but it is expected that any lab with two machines can test between 1,000 to 1,500 RT-PCR samples in a day,” he added. Meanwhile, Anoop Nautiyal from Social Development for Communities Foundation — an organisation closely tracking the pandemic in Uttarakhand said, “The state government mentions the number of samples tested per day in the health bulletin but there should be transparency in the data that how many of these tests were RT-PCR and others like antigen and TrueNat. The credibility of any test other than RT-PCR is less and I urge the government to ensure that at least half of the samples tested per day are RT-PCR.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/how-will-ukhand-govt-comply-with-hc-order-of-testing-50k-per-day-in-haridwar-only-10-govt-12-pvt-labs-in-state-which-can-test-maximum-35k-rt-pcr-samples/articleshow/81876054.cms||Ishita Mishra

The PIL may come up for urgent hearing on April 5. The plea seeks a helpline to enable the elderly to book vaccination appointments for home visits. It also wants the HC to direct the state to arrange for ambulances to ferry citizens above the age of 75, those who are differently abled and unable to visit the centres. The PIL suggests that authorities could charge around Rs 500 for the service. A similar plea by the BMC to the state was declined due to lack of policy. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pil-offer-home-vax-services-to-advanced-seniors-in-mumbai/articleshow/81879519.cms||---
---||Kochi||Ernakulam reports 1,800 TB cases in first three months of 2021||KOCHI: People with tuberculosis (TB) who lost out on treatment during the first year of Covid-19 are tracked down more in Ernakulam in the first quarter of 2021. On top of this, increasing tests to identify Covid patients also helped health workers to identify more TB patients. This invariably leads to rise in number of TB cases in the district. Currently, Ernakulam has 1,800 patients in the first quarter of 2021 against 1,600 cases last year. The health department had conducted a TB programme to trace more patients besides tracking down those visiting non-communicable disease (NCD) clinics in hospitals. “Because of scare of stigma, being quarantined if tested positive for Covid, scare of going to the hospital and getting infected with Covid dissuade many patients from visiting hospitals last year. Once we started tracking vulnerable people by conducting house visits, the number of patients increased to 1,800. We have 2017-18 data of vulnerable individuals, who are diabetic patients, those with past history of TB, contact with TB patients, those who had undergone organ transplants, smokers and alcoholics. Paediatric TB cases declined drastically. Most cases are now reported among the age group of 50 to 60 years,” said TB programme officer in Ernakulam Sarath Rao. “A campaign named ‘If not Covid, it can be TB,’ was held among healthcare workers in the district and it was successful as it traced many cases. Most TB cases are reported among diabetic patients due to their low immunity. Ernakulam distributed highest number of insulin pens to diabetic TB patients who attended the TB programme of the health department. As many as 398 of the 400 insulin pens were distributed to patients,” he added. HIV infected TB patients are also there in the district. Ernakulam witnessed only less than 10 TB fatalities last year and the deceased had other comorbidities too. There will be death audit in such cases to find out the reason for death, the official added. To provide standard treatment, the health department has already roped with all private hospitals in the district to identify TB patients and ensure that the patients get medicine either in the hospital or from the government. The project ‘System for TB elimination in private sector’ is to ensure that TB patients get anti-tubercular treatment (ATT) from government even if s/he undergoes treatment at a private hospital. Besides, other medicine systems like ayurveda and homeopathy hospitals are also roped in. If any suspected case with symptoms of TB approaches them, the patient can be transferred to the nearest hospital for testing. If s/he tests positive for TB, the patient will be brought under allopathy treatment. To encourage TB patients to undergo treatment and ensure nutritional support, Rs 500 is directly transferred to the account of the notified patients under the national TB control programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ekm-reports-1800-tb-cases-in-first-three-months-of-2021/articleshow/81876708.cms||T C Sreemol

The suspension will come into effect from Monday and will be reviewed in 15 days. The meeting of inmates with their legal counsels, however, will continue, with proper Covid-19 precautions. Also, the facilities of telephone and e-mulaqat will continue for inmates to contact their families, the administration said. “The decision has been taken to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. The situation will be reviewed in 15 days and further decisions will be taken,” said an officer. So far, a total of 130 jail inmates have tested Covid-positive, of whom 118 have recovered while two died. Ten of them are at present infected with the virus. Among the prison staff, 293 had tested positive and all have recovered. On March 20, Delhi prisons had resumed the internal meetings among the women prisoners and their relatives or family lodged in different jails, which had been stalled due to the pandemic last year. It was decided to allow the prisoners to meet each other on the first and third Saturdays. Before the pandemic, such meetings were allowed every Saturday except on second Saturdays.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-spike-kin-cant-meet-jail-inmates/articleshow/81878160.cms||---
---||Goa||After year’s break, Procession of Tails held at Se Cathedral with a few safety tweaks||OLD GOA: A unique 450-year-old tradition, the Procession of Tails at Se Cathedral, held in the laity’s presence after a year’s break due to the Covid-19 pandemic, marked the Good Friday services, as other churches across Goa held liturgical services with safety restrictions. More popularly known as the ‘Xempddeamchem Pursanv’, so known for the long black cloaks worn by Cathedral chapter members, the procession after other liturgical services is a commemoration of Jesus Christ’s crucifixion. The Cathedral being the Archbishop’s church, where he is the main celebrant with the parish and other priests at special religious ceremonies and feasts, he joins the canons or chapter members in this interesting ritual held only where Cathedrals exist. On Friday, the solemn but colourful procession with Archbishop Filipe Neri Ferrao and the canons wearing pink capes and black cloaks — the trailing parts like tails held by altar boys — followed a shorter route. With confraria members carrying the coffin of Jesus, the procession wended its way only along the church’s central aisle and northern corners instead of all four corners. Spaced out seating arrangement and Covid norms meant fewer confreres took part. But the faithful — a few even from other parts of Goa in normal times, watched in rapt attention, as soul-stirring motets and sound of clapper boards enriched the unique practice. The Cathedral chapter, comprising priests with notable records of service, had been established by Apostolic See in 1534. At one stage, it had even 30 canons, but the number dwindled to just five. Last year, the procession — livestreamed due to Covid-19 — had only two present. In November 2019, the archdiocese had appointed six more. There was no Eucharist on Friday and churches only celebrated the Passion and death of Jesus. Some churches only held liturgical services and omitted para-liturgical services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-years-break-procession-of-tails-held-at-se-cathedral-with-a-few-safety-tweaks/articleshow/81878173.cms||Paul Fernandes

---||Pune||Maharashtra teachers wait for orders on standard I to VIII grading||PUNE: Maharashtra State Primary Teachers’ Association has written to the Maharashtra State Council of Education Research and Training seeking an immediate comprehensive order on how to assess and grade the students from standard I to VIII. The letter said, unlike last year (2019-20), there were no baseline or cumulative assessments throughout 2020-21, on which the results could be prepared. Vijay Kombe, a teacher at a Zilla Parishad school in Wardha, and the general secretary of the teachers association said in an academic year, two baseline tests in August and January and two cumulative assessments in November and March are held on the basis of which the students are graded and promoted to the next level. “In the academic year 2019-20, the schools were through with two baseline tests and one cumulative assessment when the pandemic struck and a lockdown was announced. Based on the result of the three tests, average marks were given to students and they were promoted to the next class. However this year, none of those tests have taken place,” Kombe said. A Zilla Parishad teacher, who requested anonymity, said,“When I met students after the lockdown was relaxed to distribute midday meal ration, standard II students had forgotten the alphabet. Those who are in standard I now have hardly learned anything in many rural areas, despite the best efforts by the teachers. This should have been declared a zero year by the Union government at least for primary education, because sending these students to the next class, through whatever method they suggest, does not make sense,” he said. Dinkar Temkar, chairman of MSCERT, said the education department officials have been discussing the matter with the education ministry and a decision would soon be announced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/teachers-wait-for-orders-on-std-i-to-viii-grading/articleshow/81877533.cms||Ardhra Nair

This re-examination will be marked as a regular examination for those students who are appearing for the first time, however, for those who failed in the April examination and are re-appearing for this examination, this will be marked as a backlog examination. Vice chancellor Nitin Karmalkar said students appearing for the April examination will get both offline and online options. “All affiliated colleges will be provided with OMR sheets which can be provided to students during the offline examination. The university allows for the shift from online to offline and vice versa. Last year, we had both cases and hence we are keeping it flexible for students,” he added. Karmalkar added that they have to start the 2021-22 academic year in June or July. “Hence, we are trying to finish all regular and backlog examinations by then for the 2020-21 academic year. This will help students to not lose a year unnecessarily. We are trying to match the regular academic year so that final-year students do not lose out on opportunities,” he added. He also said the university will not give exclusive question banks for each subject. “Mock tests would happen and students can practice for five days to get a hang of how the online examination system works. In these mock examinations, some questions will pertain to their own course,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/final-yr-students-who-miss-april-exam-may-get-re-test/articleshow/81877529.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Pune||Man plays cap & face cover trick to steal wedding gifts at marriage halls||Pune: All that Sandip Dhotre needed was a Gandhi “topi”, “tika” on the forehead, gorgeous clothes and a face mask to sneak into marriage halls posing as either a kin of the bride or groom and eventually slip out with wedding gifts, particularly cash, in his pocket. The Pune rural police finally arrested the 46-year-old man from Pimpalgaon Joga village on the charge of stealing gifts from one such wedding ceremony in Junnar in February.The police probe revealed that Dhotre would pose as the bride or groom’s close relative and assist the person collecting gift envelopes containing cash. “Dhotre would then divert the attention of the person and steal cash from the envelopes,” assistant inspector Parashuram Kamble of the Otur police told TOI.On February 16, Dhotre stole Rs9,000 from a wedding ceremony in Junnar taluka. After receiving the complaint, the Otur police swung into action. “We checked the CCTV footage from the marriage hall and zeroed in on one well-dressed man sporting a Gandhi 'topi' (cap) and a ‘tika’ on his forehead. The man had his face covered with a mask. We then began tracing the man, as no one from either families recognised him,” Kamble said.The officer said the police recently suspected him to be at a marriage hall in Otur. “We took him into custody on March 30,” Kamble said.During sustained questioning, Dhotre admitted to his involvement in the theft. “Dhotre has been involved in similar thefts for the past five months. We have so far received one complaint. He said he was involved in more than five thefts at various marriage halls,” Kamble said.Kamble said nobody invited in the wedding events would suspect him because of his attire and mask. “Many of the guests used to hand over the envelopes containing cash to Dhotre while going to meet the newly weds,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-plays-cap-face-cover-trick-to-steal-wedding-gifts-at-marriage-halls/articleshow/81877565.cms||---
---||Mumbai||It may now take up to five days for testing & results in Mumbai||MUMBAI: With a rapid rise in Covid-19 cases, the wait for RT-PCR test results now stretches over two days. Many laboratories take 24-48 hours to schedule appointments for home collection of samples. A family of four from Andheri said they had to wait over 48 hours to get tested after their next-door neighbours were found positive. “Luckily, only one of us tested positive. The negative reports came promptly, but the positive report took nearly three days and was communicated to us by the BMC,” said a family member. Anticipating the delayed report was positive, they had already quarantined the person. “But, in all, we took five days to get clarity on our Covid status,” he said. Doctors concur the time spent in ordering a test and getting the reports is more than five days. Covid task force member Dr Shashank Joshi pointed out in an online discussion that prolonged wait for a report causes high levels of anxiety. “It takes almost two days to get a Covid-19 test done and another 2-3 days to get the report. If it’s positive, the panic starts,” he said. Often in that state of panic, people start scouting for a hospital bed though they may not need one, he said. Delay in getting the report poses another problem. Physician Dr Pratit Samdani said people don’t quarantine till a report says they are positive. “This happens a lot with those who are positive and asymptomatic,” he said, adding the delay has become slightly more acute in the past 7-10 days. Physician Dr Shahid Barmare said a report usually doesn’t come in the way of starting treatment, but a positive report provides clarity on the next course of action. Mumbai has been testing between 46,000-49,000 samples daily. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said testing has doubled since the past week. “We will be monitoring the time gap from Monday. Things should get streamlined in the next two days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/it-may-now-take-up-to-five-days-for-testing-results-in-mumbai/articleshow/81879529.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Pune||Report says poor funding for intangible heritage||Pune: The art and culture budget guide published by the cultural resource organisation Sahapedia has revealed, among other things, an almost afterthought attitude to funding research on intangible cultural heritage, as well as poor and irregular funding for individuals dependent on it for their livelihood.The report found that even with decline in funding for almost all aspects of arts and culture, intangible forms suffered the most when it comes to budgetary allocations over the years. In the 2020-21 Union Budget, intangible art forms constituted around 20% of all funds allocated to the Ministry of Culture (MoC), with up to 66% going towards tangible heritage, such as museums, libraries, and others. In the 2021-22 budget, support for intangible heritage has been cut by around 26%, the report added.Lack of funds, according to the report’s authors, pose a grave risk to thousands who make a living out of such art forms, such as folk music and theatre. Also, at risk are veteran artists engaged in these art forms who receive pensions, or work as fellows receiving grants from the MoC, with payments for most of them pending since 2019.“There will be damage to research on intangible heritage, if funding for it is cut by the government. However, research into the field has also flourished with the help of NGOs, or individuals, who have often financed their work,” said Lopamudra Maitra Bajpai, a Pune-based anthropology researcher and author.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/report-says-poor-funding-for-intangible-heritage/articleshow/81877548.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

Retired DGP Sumedh Singh Saini, suspended inspector general of police Paramraj Singh Umranangal, retired SSP Charanjit Singh Sharma, ex-MLA Mantar Singh Brar and all other accused were present in court. As the case was recently transferred in the court of Harbans Singh Lekhi, as per roster prepared from April 1, the court adjourned the cases to April 27 after a brief hearing. Saini also appeared in the court of ilaqa magistrate Ekta Uppal in the Kotkapura firing case and he was handed over the copy of the challan under Section 207 of CrPC. He was directed to appear in the court on or before April 16 as the summons to him could not be delivered. So far, nine challans have been presented in the court in both cases and there are seven accused in each of the cases. Protesters Krishan Bhagwan Singh and Gurjit Singh were killed in alleged police firing at Behbal Kalan on October 14, 2015, only hours after the police had resorted to cane charge and firing at Kotkapura to disperse people protesting against the sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib.

Cinema workers, retailers, daily wagers, small traders, etc are all daunted by the prospect of another interruption to livelihood. The Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE) wrote its concerns in a letter to Thackeray Friday. “The community of top producers, actors and actresses who then came together to the rescue of daily wage earners of the fraternity... are themselves now not in a position to provide help...,” FWICE said. Multiplex owners too point out that no important film has released in the past year.  Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO, Retailers Association of India, said that the government must ease restrictions in shopping centres and instead utilise them to speed up the inoculation drive...”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cine-workers-lobby-against-lockdown/articleshow/81879541.cms||Bella Jaisinghani
---||Delhi||Delhi: Bail for Safdarjung doctor accused of rape||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court has granted bail to a doctor working in Safdarjung Hospital, accused of raping a woman on the promise of marriage, on the ground there is nothing on record to indicate accused promised marriage to the woman. The court also noted that it is “not a case of forceful sexual assault” and if granted bail, would not be in a position to terrorise the victim or tamper with evidence. Justice Subramonium Prasad noted that it must be determined during trial if the woman’s physical relationship was based on her free consent or not. “The prosecutrix is a make-up artist and is a resident of Delhi. It cannot be said that she is a naive lady. This is not a case of forceful sexual assault,” the judge observed. The court said that the accused is a doctor working in Safdarjung Hospital and it cannot be said that he will be in a position to terrorise the woman or tamper with evidence. The court noted that the evidence has been collected and the mobile phone of the man is with police. “In view of the above, this court finds it just and expedient to grant bail to the petitioner (doctor) in the event of arrest for offences punishable under Sections 376 (punishment for rape) and 328 (causing hurt by means of poison with and intent to commit an offence) of the IPC,” it added while granting bail. The high court also directed the doctor to give all his mobile numbers and address to the investigating officer and that he should report to the police station concerned. According to the woman, her father had suffered a heart attack in January 2019 and she took him to Safdarjung Hospital, where the accused was the duty doctor. During the course of treatment, he visited her residence and gave his profile with intent of marriage. The woman alleged that later, he called her to meet him. She said that once she went to his friend’s house where she was given a soft drink after which she lost consciousness. On regaining consciousness, she realised she had been raped, she alleged. When she confronted the man, she was allegedly threatened that a video had been recorded by him and would be made viral. Later, she was called to hotels and raped repeatedly, she claimed. An FIR was lodged at Hauz Khas police station on January 28, 2021. The court noted that the material on record shows that though initially the woman had lodged a “rape case”, later the allegation was “sexual relationship established on the basis of promise to marry”. “There are contradictions between the initial version and the present version of the prosecutrix,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bail-for-safdarjung-doc-accused-of-rape/articleshow/81878354.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Highest pay package hits a five-year low at IRMA||Vadodara/ Anand: The Institute of Rural Management Anand (IRMA) has been able to secure 100% placements for students of its flagship programme postgraduate diploma in management (rural management) despite the ongoing Covid-19 induced pandemic and an economically challenging year. But the overall impact on the economy has hit the pay packages offered to students. The highest salary package offered to a PGDM (RM) student has come down from over Rs 50 lakh per annum in the last two years to Rs 19 lakh per annum this year. It is after a gap of almost five years that the highest salary package has seen such a drastic fall. While the highest package offered stood at Rs 19 lakh per annum, the lowest package was Rs 5.4 lakh per annum as IRMA completed the final placements for the 40th batch of the PGDM (RM) students. Since 2016, the highest salary package offered to rural management graduates has been on a steady rise. “There was one organisation that was offering the international position. Perhaps, due to issues related to the pandemic, they have not participated,” said professor Aashish Argade, who chaired the placement activities this year. He, however, said that the median and mean packages haven’t seen a huge impact. Last year, the median package stood at Rs 10.63 lakh per annum while the mean package was Rs 10.9 lakh per annum. “This year, the median package is Rs 10.35 lakh per annum while the mean package is Rs 10.81 lakh per annum,” he said. Due to the pandemic, the institute conducted the placement process virtually where recruiters and students participated in an online mode. “Out of 215 students, 27 secured pre-placement offers (PPO) based on work done in internships and live projects,” he said. “One of the PPOs was an international offer with Mahyco International in the APAC region.” Vedanta CSR, NTPC CSR, Brooke India, Foundation for Development of Rural Value Chains, BAIF Development Research Foundation, Panchayati Raj (Telangana government) and Access Livelihoods Consulting were other prominent recruiters. Like in the past, the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) that markets brand Amul emerged as the largest recruiter during the placement season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/highest-pay-package-hits-a-five-year-low-at-irma/articleshow/81877474.cms||Prashant Rupera

At present, the two cities are being supplied with groundwater with tube wells. As per the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) report, the groundwater has been overexploited, and the quality of drinking water has deteriorated causing health hazards. Therefore, it has been proposed to change water supply from ground to canal water to ensure uninterrupted potable drinking water supply in the urban areas. An official spokesperson said chief minister Amarinder Singh had been vigorously pursuing with the Centre to secure World Bank and AIIB loan to ensure clean drinking water to the residents in these cities. The other two canal-based water supply projects in Jalandhar and Patiala are already under execution. The spokesperson said the entire project would be co-financed by IBRD (World Bank) loan of $105 million and AIIB loan of $105 million, along with Punjab government funds to the tune of $90 million.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/wb-aiib-to-fund-canal-based-drinking-water-plan-for-amritsar-ludhiana/articleshow/81877577.cms||---

Police confirmed that no one was injured in the attack and Tikait’s car was a few kilometre away from the spot when it took place. Tatarpur police have registered an FIR in the case and detained Yadav and others by the Tatarpur police station till the last report came. Yadav won the post of RRBMU student union president as an independent candidate in 2019. Tikait, while talking to media persons after the incident in Bansur, held BJP responsible for the attack on his convey. “The local BJP leaders were behind the attack on the convoy. The attackers pelted stones, damaged windowpanes, thrown ink, tried to snatch the gun from security personnel and showed black flags to us. It has made our resolve stronger and will continue to fight until three farm laws scrapped,” said Tikait. Following the attack, Jaipur-Delhi Highway was blocked for two hours by the Tikait supporters. The traffic on the busiest highway come to a grinding halt with a queue of vehicles lined up for kilometres The blockade was lifted only after senior police assured them of quick action on the accused. Heavy police were deployed at the Mahapanchayat area in Bansur to avert any untoward incident Bhiwadi SP Ram Moorthy Joshy told TOI that incident happened when Tikait and his aides were heading from Harsoli to Bansur for a Mahapanchayat at 4pm. “Their convoy was chased by a group of students holding banners and posters calling Tikait anti-national. They pelted stones on the convoy. However, Tikait car was far ahead of the group of students. The incident followed by a scuffle between students and farmers,” said Joshy. He said police have detained four persons in connection with the attack on the convoy. “Our teams have been rushed to arrest the accused who were identified by us.” Reacting to the incident, Alwar MP Baba Balak Nath said that the attack has nothing to do with the BJP. “The allegations levelled by Tikait is far from reality. Protest is an integral part of a healthy democracy. Everyone has a right to do and violence has no place in society. I condemn the attack on farmer leader Rakesh Tikait,” said Nath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-responsible-for-attack-on-convoy-tikait/articleshow/81877581.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Conflict of interest: Centre raps green panel members||Mumbai: Members of various environment expert appraisal committees have been directed by the Centre to avoid conflict of interest.The union ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) in a memorandum issued on Tuesday directed members of all Expert Appraisal Committees to give a written undertaking that they do not have any personal interest in any matter being considered by the committee to which they have been appointed. Also, that they have not been involved in any consultancy work/service on the subject matter for which the committee has been constituted for a period of two years prior to their selection.“Instances have been brought to the notice of this ministry that certain members of committees, constituted by this ministry, have also undertaken assignment (consultancy services) on the same issues thereby leading to conflict of interest. Members are under obligation to ensure there is no conflict between their duties and responsibilities mandated in the terms of reference of their committees and their other professional commitments,” reads the memorandum.The notice comes a month after chairman of the CRZ Expert Appraisal Committee Deepak Apte recused himself from the hearing for clearance of additional reclamation for the Mumbai coastal road citing conflict of interest. The EAC granted BMC clearance to reclaim the additional 21 hectares taking the total area to be reclaimed from the sea to 111 hectares.Environmentalist Debi Goenka said the issue of conflict of interest has been known to the ministry since the ’90s and it was surprising it had taken so long to address the issue. He further said, “Apte recused himself this time, but in 2017 he headed the committee that granted the first CRZ clearance for the coastal road. Why was he not conflicted then?” In a letter to the ministry last month, after the EAC granted clearance for additional reclamation, Goenka complained that the Conservation Action Trust had sought an opportunity to be heard before considering the proposal, but it was not done. He also complained that additional municipal commissioner Ashwini Bhide and deputy chief engineer Chakradhar Kandalkar had in October last year attended the Maharashtra Coastal Management Committee meeting on the coastal road issue as members of the authority instead of recusing themselves because of conflict of interest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/conflict-of-interest-centre-raps-green-panel-members/articleshow/81878220.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Kolkata||Mamata slams central agencies for ‘targeted’ raids||Kolkata: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday strongly criticised the income tax raids on DMK leader M K Stalin’s kin. She alleged that the central agencies are selectively targeting non-BJP leaders, giving the impression that IT, CBI and ED suffer from “koro na” (do not do it) when it comes to BJP leaders. Speaking at a rally in Cooch Behar, the Trinamool chief said: “I have been in touch with the DMK leaders since morning. The way IT raids have been conducted on Stalin’s daughter and son-in-law is unacceptable. Tamil Nadu goes to polls in a few days. Would the IT, CBI or ED dare to conduct raids on BJP leaders in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, or Bihar? Their brief is to target non-BJP leaders and for others, it is koro na.” Speaking to reporters, TMC MP Saugata Roy said: “This is pure political vendetta. We heard their leaders talking big on dynastic politics (in Tamil Nadu) whereas in Bengal, they go mum on the Adhikari family.” Roy said, “They have made a habit of spreading fake news and lies. They are growing desperate with every passing day. First, they said Mamata Banerjee will contest from another seat. It is a lie. Even today, it was alleged that I-PAC has severed its relationship with Trinamool Congress. This is false.” Roy added that the party hoped that the Election Commission was noticing the deliberate attempts to influence voters with “misinformation and lies.” Referring to the EVM incident in Assam, Roy said, “In Assam’s Karimganj, EVM was found in a BJP candidate’s vehicle. The EC accepted its fault for this.” Adding that this incident may not be isolated, Roy urged the EC to focus on the repeated complaints of EVM glitches in Bengal. “In the first two phases, we have reported 326 such complaints to the EC. We hope the EC addresses this issue in the forthcoming phases,” he said. The TMC on Friday also complained to the EC on repeated EVM glitches, alleging that in several cases, the glitches were reported after several voters had cast their votes. “Those votes will not be recorded, since the voters will not return to cast their votes again. Who will take the onus for this?” a senior party leader said. Roy also alleged the central forces are unable to control violent incidents in Bengal. “We condemn oppression by central forces. Due to atrocities, people get scared. If the Election Commission is unable to control them, we will have to protest,” he said. Roy said officers against whom specific complaints have been lodged should not be on poll duty. Roy also took a jibe at Union home minister Amit Shah’s prediction of BJP winning 200 seats in Bengal and said his predictions are always wrong. Shah’s prediction was wrong for Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, and Rajasthan, where the BJP could not form the government, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mamata-slams-central-agencies-for-targeted-raids/articleshow/81877582.cms||---

TPCC chief N Uttam Kumar Reddy said Sonia Gandhi has granted statehood to Telangana to ensure that youth will not take their lives for jobs. “But seven years after the TRS came to power in the state, the unemployment problem has only increased,” he said.

Pitliya filed his nomination as an independent candidate was seen as a spoilsport for the BJP candidate Ratanlal Jat. A politician in Karnataka played a vital role in convincing Pitlia who has readymade business in Bangaluru, said sources. Pitliya’s name was among the panel from Sahara constituency said sources adding that he was backed by the senior leaders from the state. “His name was dropped considering the caste calculations favouring Jat in the constituency,” said the sources. This is for the second time Pitliya had rebelled against the BJP. He was denied a ticket in 2018 from Sahara and contested as an independent candidate. He sealed the defeat for BJP candidate Roop Lal Jat by securing 30,573 votes in a contest where Jat lost to the Congress candidate by 7,000 votes. Sources told that Pitliya carried out big relief work in Sahara during the lockdown which has increased his popularity manifold was also a reason that party debated his candidature till the eleventh hour. He joined the party on February 10, apparently after assured of getting a ticket to contest from Sahara. The state unit took a sigh of relief with the move. BJP state president Satish Poonia carried out series of negotiations with Pitliya and sealed the deal with him last night with the help of a minister in Karnataka. “Pitliya named was considered till the last hour. I am happy that he has withdrawn his candidature without any condition. The party has assured him that he will be given his due respect and position in the state,” said Poonia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/relief-for-bjp-as-pitlia-withdraws-nomination/articleshow/81877585.cms||---

The Tiswadi deputy collector on Friday shockingly held a meeting in a cramped space to warn heads of religious institutes and commercials establishments that they would have to face the music if they flouted Covid SOPs. At the hurriedly called meeting there was no scope to follow social distancing as invitees jostled for a space to remain standing in the crowded small conference room of the North Goa collectorate. Members of some temple committees from Tiswadi left in a huff without attending the meeting as they were kept waiting outside, while deputy collector Gurudas Desai addressed a few reporters who managed to get into the jam-packed hall. “Why have we been called and made to wait? Have Covid cases gone up only today,” a temple committee member said. “Will infection not spread when a meeting is held in such a crowded space?” another attendee said. Some committee members were seen animatedly questioning the collectorate staff for being made to wait. Even as an official requested them to have patience till the deputy collector was free, they chose to leave after putting down their signatures to record their attendance. Representatives of casinos and hotels were also left standing outside the conference room. When it was pointed out that holding the meeting in such a small area amounted to flouting of Covid norms, Desai said that they were left with no choice but to assemble in the conference room. “Representatives were told to wait for some time and that they will be addressed later, but nobody wants to wait,” Desai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-fails-to-lead-by-example-at-meet-held-to-issue-stern-warning/articleshow/81878267.cms||---

The civic body is going to set up 14 vaccination centres for the task and has sent a detailed proposal to the district collector seeking requisite funds. Officials in the CMC told TOI that the city has total population of approximately 3.55 lakh, out of which 25,641 citizens have been vaccinated with Covishield till date. As per rough estimate, nearly 27% population of city, approximately 95,954, is aged 45 years and above and plan is to vaccinate all of them. With 25,641 citizens already been vaccinated till date, it leaves 70,313 who are yet to get the vaccine. At present, 6 immunization centres are functioning under the CMC and around 600 citizens are being vaccinated with Covishield daily at the rate of 100 inoculations per day / per centre. If 70,313 citizens are to be vaccinated in the next 45 days, approximately 14 vaccination centres are needed to be operationalized. Civic officials have identified locations for new vaccination centres and have sought grant from the collector. “Even if the government orders to vaccinate every citizen in the age group of 18 years or 13 years and above in future, these 14 vaccination centres will have to continue its drive for 45 more days to complete full vaccination campaign of 90 days,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/chandrapur-aims-covid-jab-for-all-45-in-45-days/articleshow/81877594.cms||Mazhar Ali

A Trinamool delegation, which met chief electoral officer (CEO) Ariz Aftab, complained that the party has filed around 300 complaints (with the EC) against BJP supporters and “stooges” for threatening and intimidating voters. The party also alleged that in some cases, the voters are not being allowed to cast their votes and in some cases, they are being forced to vote for BJP. The second complaint was on central forces. “We have told the poll panel that the role of central forces have been partial in many booths in the first two phases. There have been incidents of violence and attacks on our party supporters by BJP. We have asked the EC to see to it that this is not repeated in the next six phases,” Yashwant Sinha, who was part of the delegation, said. The third was about “faulty EVMs”. The party reported 326 such complaints in phases I and II. The party said in several cases, EVMs developed snag after votes had been cast and those votes were lost. State minister Subrata Mukherjee, also part of the delegation, said, “I have seen elections for the last 50 years. (But) I have never witnessed such blatant interference in the election process by the government in Delhi before.” The Bengal BJP, too, lodged a complaint with the EC against TMC chief Mamata Banerjee for sitting inside a Nandigram booth on Thursday and “influence” voters. It also alleged that she violated the Representation of People’s Act by sitting inside the booth for more than two hours. “The chief minister can surely visit a booth as a candidate. But she reached this particular booth and stayed inside for a prolonged period. This violates the model code of conduct and Representation of People’s Act. Her presence also caused escalation of tension in nearby areas,” said Shishir Bajoria, spokesperson of the Bengal BJP. “Yesterday, she herself went out and started fomenting trouble. This does not suit her as the chief minister and as a candidate,” said Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-and-bjp-move-ec-lodge-plaints/articleshow/81877599.cms||---

Congress state president and education minister Govind Singh Dotasra claimed that Pitliya, who has businesses in Karnataka, was forced by the BJP to withdraw his nomination. “The party that exhorts nationalism and morality threatened to destroy the business of Pitliya and pressured his family to withdraw the nomination. Congress condemns this,” Dotasra told reporters. He added, “The BJP thinks it can add to its votes by such kind of goonda acts but it should know people do not support immoral acts. Even after forcing the withdrawal of nomination, BJP will not be able to win from Sahara.” Dotasra even tweeted a picture of Pitliya being pulled away by a youth outside a building and commented that BJP feared losing Sahara, hence, forced the independent candidate to withdraw the nomination. Pitliya could not be reached for a statement as his mobile phone remained switched off. A letter and an audio message attributed to Pitliya was doing rounds on social media but the authenticity of these could not be verified. BJP state president Satish Poonia, however, countered the Congress charge. Quoting Dotasra’s tweet, Poonia tweeted, “Govind ji, the fear is visible in the statements of (chief minister) Ashok Gehlot, who is threatening the voters. Your calculations seem to have gone wrong. Do not daydream relying on misuse of government machinery and capitalists. Don’t fall in the trap; for once see the fate of big leaders in your party.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-bjp-trade-charge-over-sahara-candidate-withdrawing-papers/articleshow/81877609.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Mucormycosis, a serious fungal infection, on rise in Covid patients: Doctor||NAGPUR: Doctors treating Covid-19 patients in city are coming across unusually high number of patients either with Covid-19 or in post-Covid phase representing with mucormycosis, an uncommon but serious infection. This fungal infection complicates the course of severe Covid-19 and also creates major hurdles in post-Covid recovery of patients, says infectious disease specialist Dr Ashwini Tayade. “So many young people have lost their vision due to this. On top of it, mental agony and financial burden is huge,” said Dr Tayade adding that recovered patients having diabetes are at a high risk of developing this infection. “While Covid-19 is associated with pulmonary aspergillosis is increasingly recognized, mucormycosis used to be considered as rare. But we are coming across high number of patients with this infection in last few days,” said Dr Tayade. According to her, medication and early diagnosis can save vision in some cases, but the treatment includes long-term hospitalization. “One of my patients is under treatment since November 2020, and recovery process is still underway,” she said. “Mucormycosis is a fungal infection we used to commonly see in diabetes patients but numbers were never high. Now, with deadly combination of Covid-19, steroids and uncontrolled diabetes, the numbers are soaring,” she said. According to Dr Tayade, timely diagnosis, reference and multi-speciality approach can save many patients. “And most important is the use of steroids while treating Covid-19. We need to develop a protocol of steroid use for diabetic Covid-19 patients,” she said. Critical care specialist Dr Satish Puranik said that chances of mucormycosis recovery depend greatly on early diagnosis and treatment. “The infection has the potential to spread throughout the body. Especially, those having diabetic conditions must take additional care. It’s important to keep yourself safe outdoors,” he said. In a relief, mucormycosis is not contagious, so one can’t get it from an infected person. Self care measures are the best way to prevent this type of infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mucormycosis-a-serious-fungal-infection-on-rise-in-covid-patients-doc/articleshow/81877613.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The agency will oversee works that provide a permanent solution to issues such as traffic, submerging of areas under flood water among other things. The agency will take up developmental works in all assembly constituencies, municipalities and other important towns in two districts. These works include developing infrastructure such as power, drinking water, cleanliness, repairing of sewerage and drainage, and construction of integrated vegetable and meat markets, town halls and laying of roads. The CM instructed chief secretary to hold meetings with the ministers, MLAs, MLCs and officials of departments. At a review meeting on Friday at Pragathi Bhavan, he said that for the development of infrastructure facilities, proper plans were needed. “The government is ready to provide adequate funds,” KCR said.

A smaller number of patients who were found Covid-19 positive had similar symptoms and were surprised that despite having no other common symptoms including fever, running nose, trouble in breathing and others they got infected. TOI on Friday discussed these symptoms with the experts of the Covid management and treatment of the state to know if these are indicative of Covid-19. “Yes, we have witnessed patients who had no fever, running nose, trouble in breathing, but they complained of joint pain, muscular pain and fatigue. These symptoms on a smaller number of patients have been seen in the last fortnight. So, in this scenario, it is always advisable to go for a Covid-19 test. Because as I have been repeating that early detection is always helpful in the cure,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, head and controller, SMS hospital, and also head of the Covid management and treatment in the state. He added that a majority of the patients are asymptomatic, but some of them had complained of muscular pain. “For these patients, we need not go for our common protocol like azithromycin and others. Only paracetamol as a pain killer is given. Also, if their pain is subsided within some days after detection of Covid, they are advised to monitor their oxygen saturation,” said Dr Ajeet Singh, superintendent of RUHS, a Covid-19 dedicated hospital at Jaipur. A few patients who wished not to be named shared their experiences. “I got mild joint pain and muscular pain in my shoulders and legs. I went to a doctor who advised me to go for Covid test. On March 24, my report was positive and I was surprised. I am in touch with my doctor and under home quarantine and now I have no symptoms left,” said a 42-year-old patient in Vaishali Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pain-in-joints-and-fatigue-could-be-signs-of-covid-19-experts/articleshow/81877639.cms||Ashish Mehta

Before the lockdown, the department’s target was Rs 6,000 crore, which was reduced to Rs 5,200 crore in January as the lockdown had raised doubts amongst the officials if they would be able to meet this target as till January the earnings were just about 1/3 of the total.  On a positive note, officials claimed that in four years, they have generated highest revenue for the month of March. Transport commissioner Ravi Jain told TOI, “We have earned Rs 4334 crore for this year and the number and keeping the target in mind, this is a very good collection. All the centres have done well and for the first time in four years, we had high earnings during March which was around Rs 1000 crore. This was despite the fact that there was a lockdown in place. This is because of the advance tax on the commercial vehicles that we received.” According to officials, as the sale of automobiles has been lower this year, a significant amount of revenue, which used to be earned from it, had gone down. Officials added that since maintenance of buses were continuing even during lockdown, it added to the expenditure of the department. However, the earnings almost doubled towards February and March as compared to January and during the first three months, the earnings were around Rs 2,000 crore. Under the amnesty scheme, the department received Rs 100 crore.  During the entire month of March, officials kept a close scrutiny on all the RTOs to ensure that they meet the targets for their respective centres and places like Kota, Chittorgarh amongst others which were initially slow in achieving the same also finally caught up, claimed officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/transport-dept-earns-83-of-its-target/articleshow/81877622.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Loan apps case: Fintech firms gave fake addresses to NBFCs||HYDERABAD: Police have stumbled upon China-backed fintech companies, with whom the non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) had tied up to disperse loans through apps, allegedly giving fake addresses while entering into agreements with NBFCs. The issue was brought to the notice of police by representatives of several NBFCs across the country since their bank accounts were frozen by cops during a pan-India crackdown on various call centres and the companies linked to them. The call centres allegedly made abusive calls to the loanees, besides sending defamatory messages about the loanees to the people in their phone contact list. Six persons have taken their lives due to harassment by loan sharks in the state. The NBFCs gave police details of how they entered into deals with the fintech companies. According to police, the fintech companies had started approaching various NBFCs in Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai and other cities more than a year ago. “These fintech companies told NBFCs that if they tie up with them, they will help them in increasing their business by introducing more customers and also take the responsibility of recovering the money from the loanees,” Hyderabad police officials said. The fintech firms used to develop and upload the apps on Play Store or similar platforms and through these apps, the operation of disbursement and recovery used to take place. “The NBFCs have to just disperse the money to the fintech firms, which would give loans to those who apply through the app,” police said. The NBFCs fell for the bait offered by the fintech firms. “The fintech companies, while entering into an agreement with the NBFCs, mentioned some addresses. But in most of the cases, the addresses have been found to be fake,” police added. Police said they will defreeze the bank accounts that are linked to the NBFCs and if the tie-up with fintech firms has not led to harassment of loanees. Telangana police have arrested 50 persons from various parts of the country in connection with the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/loan-apps-case-fintech-firms-gave-fake-addresses-to-nbfcs/articleshow/81877645.cms||Srinath Vudali

---||Hyderabad||Groundwater table takes a dip with early onset of summer||HYDERABAD: Hit hard by the early onset of summer and meteorological experts predicting sweltering months ahead, here is more bad news in store as Hyderabad’s groundwater department (GWD) has observed a dip in the water table already. Despite receiving 40 per cent excess rainfall in 2020, and authorities allaying fears of any water shortage till 2022, the 1-2 meters dip in groundwater across the city has left authorities worried. According to the GWD’s report, the groundwater table dip has been measured through a total of 21 piezometers installed in various areas, including Asifnagar, Bandlaguda, Charminar, Himayathnagar, Nampally, Saidabad, Ameerpet, Khairatabad, Marredpally, Musheerabad, Secunderabad, Shaikpet, and Tirumalagiri in Hyderabad district. “Consumption increased suddenly after lockdown was lifted. Construction activity has picked up in real estate, which was stuck for the past few months due to prolonged lockdown and all commercial units and industries reopened their business. Hostels, coaching centres and messes across the city have also resumed,” said a senior GWD official, spelling out the possible reasons. Consumption of groundwater is very high in commercial areas. For instance, a two-metre dip compared to the February data has been observed in SR Nagar, which is said to be the largest commercial area in the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. Simultaneously, the water table has dipped alarmingly in Khairatabad, Ameerpet, Marredpally and Tirumalagiri. The GWD also predicted that in the coming months, groundwater tables may dip by another two to three meters, if indiscriminate consumption is not stopped during the summer season. The Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) is providing uninterrupted potable water supply, as all the drinking water sources have sufficient water levels, but officials say all that can change if there are no checks in place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/groundwater-table-takes-a-dip-with-early-onset-of-summer/articleshow/81877677.cms||Sunil Mungara

Angad Singh, owner of Pablo restaurant said there is no logic in shutting things in the evening. “Does the virus spread only in the evening and that too in restaurants. It’s a well-known fact that the maximum crowd is out during daytime and streets get deserted as the night wears on. There’s no way that crowding happens at restaurants because in a district, with an almost 40 lakh population, the cumulative seating capacity in restaurants would be hardly 40,000. And even that is now operating at only 50% capacity due to restrictions. So, no question of crowding at restaurants,” said Singh. For those who have restaurants as part of a larger set-up, like residential hotels, the situation is worse. Manish Gopalani, director of Hotel Ramesons, said these restrictions have virtually shut down all three sources of their income. “Wedding banquets of 50 people are financially not feasible. The restaurant business is only at night, so that’s also gone. And our lodging arrangements are mostly for wedding guests and those visiting nearby Gorewada, which too is not happening. So basically, we find ourselves without any source of income now,” said Gopalani. Start-ups too are bearing the brunt of the pandemic. Sachin Jahagirdar, co-owner of Shadows Cafe, said start-ups like his are struggling. “Since around two years of our operations, we have been effectively shut for over seven months. Even after restarting, we had to operate at half the capacity and with restricted timings. We have been forced to lay off staff and even slash salaries of those on rolls. We are always talking about the start-up India initiative, but it seems the authorities are not providing us with the environment,” said Jahagirdar. The limited customer policy is getting flak from all quarters. Shilpi Singh Bagdi, owner of Chill N Grill, said, “I am just surprised that we are again repeating the limited restriction policy. It seems that the government wants to martyr our industry by all these announcements. It’s surprising that during political rallies nobody follows rules, but restaurants have to comply with each and every guideline. These restrictions also affect the storage of food and increase wastage leading to losses.” Online orders are not keeping businesses afloat. Dilip Kamdar, owner of Naivedhyam, said, “Over 70% of food sales happen in the dinner slot. So, by cutting that one can guage the level of impact our industry is going through. Online orders do not provide that level of business which can keep us afloat, considering that commissions also take away a chunk of the pie.” About online orders, Pablo’s owner Singh said, “For themed restaurants which provide exotic dishes and a fine dining experience, online orders don’t work. Nobody is going to order an exquisite continental dish in a parcel box.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/any-new-restrictions-will-be-last-nail-in-coffin-of-restaurants-owners/articleshow/81877693.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Hyderabad||Covid restrictions had lesser impact on Hyderabad pollution level||HYDERABAD: Impact of restrictions during various phases of the Covid-19 lockdown shows the reduction in daily mean PM 2.5 concentration was the lowest in Hyderabad among five Indian mega cities, including New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata and Mumbai. Track the pollution level in your cityResearchers from Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh and Punjab University, studied air pollution during pre-lockdown, lockdown and unlocking phases for the five megacities in the absence of major anthropogenic activities. The study indicated that the maximum reduction in PM 2.5 concentration was observed in Kolkata (62%), followed by Mumbai (49%), Chennai (34%) and New Delhi (26%) during the lockdown period. Comparatively, Hyderabad exhibited a lesser reduction in PM 2.5 concentration at 10%. “In lockdown 1, with stricter restrictions, the concentration of PM 2.5 decreased significantly (compared to that before the lockdown period) in all megacities except for Hyderabad. Kolkata shows the highest reduction in lockdowns 2, 3, and 4 at 70.9%, 71.6%, and 78.1%, respectively, whereas the minimum decrease in PM concentration was observed in lockdowns 2 and 4 in Hyderabad,” read the research paper, published in the Environmental Science and Pollution Research journal in January, 2021. In Hyderabad, vehicular exhaust (31%) and resuspension of dust (26%) are also major contributors to ambient PM 2.5 levels, followed by combustion (9%), industries (7%), and waste burning (6%). Meteorological parameters such as rainfall and air masses movement played a significant role in PM reduction in Hyderabad. “In Hyderabad, the PM 2.5 levels were substantially low even before the lockdown. Hence, there was not much of difference even when the lockdown was declared. “For a city like Hyderabad, even 10% of reduction in PM 2.5 was significant,” said Khaiwal Ravindra, additional professor of environment health, School of Public Health, PGIMER, Chandigarh, who led the study. The study reports a new baseline level of PM 2.5 for five Indian mega cities. This knowledge can be extended to plan future air pollution reduction strategies to minimise the impact of poor air quality on premature mortality and morbidity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-restrictions-had-lesser-impact-on-hyd-pollution-level/articleshow/81877691.cms||Preeti Biswas
---||Hyderabad||Eatala bats for ryots’ stir again||Hyderabad: Health minister Eatala Rajender upped the ante again in support of farmers’ agitation, making no bones about his displeasure for the new farm laws introduced by the Centre. Taking part in a meeting of BC employees’ union here on Friday, the minister said there is a greater need to support the agitation of farmers in Delhi against the agri laws. “The main reason for poverty in this country is due to centralisation of country’s wealth. Concentrated wealth leads to poverty. If a top industrialist’s wealth is getting multi-fold year on year, it would not help resolve the problems of common man and remove poverty in the country,” he said. The minister said if people do not respond to farmers’ agitation, it would hit them hard in some time soon. Claiming that he was not talking any politics here, the minister said he was only referring to the problems of farmers. He also faulted the policies of the Centre, especially corporatisation and disinvestment of PSUs. “Why is the Centre privatising LIC?” he wondered. “We should not burn our house to smoke out a rat,” he said, referring to privatisation of PSUs which are making profits. He said for ruling or leading a government, merit is necessary. “Similarly, for getting a medical seat, we look at merit.” He said sadly the same spirit is not reflected in some sectors, which is leading to inequality in the society. Rajender on several occasions has made comments on various issues concerning society in recent times and had even taken a dig at the TRS party leadership. Last week, TRS working president KT Rama Rao held a one-to-one meeting with Rajender over his comments at a meeting in his constituency. Rajender, during the inauguration of a Rythu Vedika at Veenavanka in Karimnagar district 10 days ago, said not money, caste or party are important and that only good deeds and humanism are important to him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-bats-for-ryots-stir-again/articleshow/81877695.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||‘Action against those refusing addl internship after govt reply’||PANAJI: Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital is waiting for the government’s response to initiate action against medical students who have refused to attend their internships for extra two-and-a-half months after they completed a regular 12-month internship on March 17. “We have informed the government about the matter and are waiting to hear from it to take the next step,” said GMC dean Dr S M Bandekar in his reply to a query on what action will be taken against the interns who have refused an additional period of internship. As of Friday, 130 interns had not joined the duty.  The GMC authorities and students’ representatives had a few meetings, but the stalemate continues as they have laid down “unreasonable” conditions while negotiating, said the head of a department (HoD). Bandekar said the internship period was extended after the National Medical Commission (NMC) issued the advisory to medical colleges in the country that students be given hands-on training since they were robbed of that opportunity as they were posted on Covid duties throughout the year. The students in their representation to the college, pointed out that the NMC advisory was issued in December 2020 yet the order extending their internship was issued on the last day of their internship. The students have put forth three conditions before the college for agreeing to the extra internship — first, permanent medical registration, which is due for issue on March 18, 2021, be immediately released. Second, the additional period of internship completed be deducted from their 12-month bond, and third, they be paid Rs 60,000 a month, the salary paid to junior residents. Another HoD said except the demand the additional period of internship be adjusted towards bond service, other two are unreasonable. “They must remember it is only after satisfactory completion of their internship, that college will issue their permanent medical registration even if they have completed 12months of internship,” he said. During the first phase of the pandemic most of the time they did only Covid duties. “They got zero exposure in other departments. Covid will pass off after two years but other skills an intern learns will be required throughout his/her career. If they lack basic skill what work will they do when they serve as bond doctors?” the HoD said.

---||Delhi||DU college relieves arrested professor of duties||NEW DELHI: The wheelchair-bound G N Saibaba, in prison since 2017 for alleged links with Maoists, was relieved of his employment by Ram Lal Anand College on March 31, his wife, Vasantha Kumari, has revealed. The termination letter quoted a college memorandum stating, “The services of Dr G N Saibaba, assistant professor, RLA College, are terminated with effect from the afternoon of March 31, 2021.” Kumari claimed that the family hadn’t been given any intimation about the impending termination nor afforded the opportunity to explain the academic’s views to the college governing body. “This is against natural justice. When the trial against G N Saibaba is going on, how can the college take such a decision?” she asked. “Academically, there were no problems with Saibaba’s record. His students support him and the staff association has also expressed its solidarity with him.” Saibaba was suspended by the college in 2014 after Maharashtra police arrested him for alleged Maoist links. Saibaba, wheelchair bound with 90% disability, is currently in Nagpur Central jail. The college had formed an inquiry committee in 2016, and in December 2019, Kumari had submitted a reply on behalf of Saibaba requesting the college not to take further action against him in view of his appeal challenging his conviction and sentencing being sub-judice. The letter also pointed out that when the late professor SAR Geelani of Zakir Hussain College was arrested and convicted in the Parliament attack case, he was only suspended by his institution. After his appeal and acquittal, the suspension had been revoked. On September 3 last year, when the college sought a response from Saibaba, Kumari replied on September 21 that she hadn’t met her husband after March earlier that year because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Requesting more time for a reaction, she had written, “I haven’t had a discussion with him about issues pertaining to the inquiry report/departmental proceedings since then because prison meetings for inmates of Central Jail, Nagpur, where he is housed, have been suspended since March 2020.” Though the college notice said three months’ salary would be paid as per DU Ordinance XI of the DU Act, the termination of her husband’s service would spell financial difficulties for Kumari and her daughter. “Following his suspension, we were only getting half his salary. Termination means we will not get anything. I am a housewife and my daughter is still studying. How will we survive?” asked Kumari. Human rights organisations and civil society groups seeking his release have expressed shock at the termination. They had, on February 17, demanded medical parole for Saibaba after he tested positive for Covid. DU Teachers’ Association president Rajib Ray questioned the decision “when the option of judicial appeal is still pending”. He added the college should review its decision. Ray also inferred that the termination must have had the approval of acting vice-chancellor P C Joshi under Ordinance XI. Despite queries sent to R K Gupta, principal, Ram Lal Anand College, and the acting DU VC, there were no responses from either.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-college-relieves-arrested-prof-of-duties/articleshow/81878372.cms||Mohammad Ibrar
---||Kolhapur||O2 supply to industries will not be hampered: Galande||Kolhapur: The district administration has adequate stock of medical oxygen to cope with rise in Covid cases, so the supply of oxygen to industries will not be hampered, said Bhausaheb Galande, the resident district collector (RDC) of Kolhapur.District collector Daulat Desai has appointed Galande as the head to monitor oxygen supply to hospitals and Covid care centres (CCC) in the district. During the peak of Covid cases in the last wave of the pandemic, the demand for oxygen had reached 14 metric tonne per day. Currently, the medical oxygen generated daily is around 13 metric tonne and around 28 metric tonnes is in stock.The order by district collector Desai to the oxygen manufacturers to ensure 80% of supply for Covid purpose and the remaining for the industrial purpose has worried industrialists. The industry in the district and neighbouring Sangli and Belgaum districts depends on manufacturers from Kolhapur district. They feared slowing down of industrial activities if the oxygen supply is tampered with. Galande said the order was issued in line with the state government’s directions, however, the industrialists need not have to worry while the Covid cases are under control.Galande said, “Currently, we have adequate stock and there is a daily generation of oxygen, which is more than what is needed. Though order to reserve the oxygen for Covid patients is in place, it is not yet mandated. Currently, the cases are less and this time also we are ensuring the available oxygen is utilised wisely.”A team of officials have been appointed to check the smooth supply of oxygen to hospitals in their respective jurisdiction. For instance, Kolhapur Municipal Corporation’s (KMC) chief health officer Ashok Pol has been assigned the task to manage the supply to both public and private hospitals in Kolhapur city. The officials said the installation of the oxygen tanks of larger capacities has made the task easy. Earlier, whenever it was needed, oxygen cylinders, which have limited storage capacity, have to be transported to the hospitals. Now, the once filled oxygen tanks with a capacity of around 6,000 litre will stay for over a week in a 250-bed Covid hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/o2-supply-to-industries-will-not-be-hampered-galande/articleshow/81875602.cms||---

On Friday, the number of new Covid-19 cases stood at 965, according to a media bulletin released by the health department. Also, with five more fatalities, the toll rose to 1,706. The spike in cases has been observed from March 9 when 189 people tested positive for the infection. While 59,343 residents were tested on Friday, the results of 1,927 people are still awaited. Health minister Eatala Rajender said on Thursday said that Telangana is at critical juncture in its fight against Covid-19 pandemic. “The pandemic has created a war-like situation and there is a dire need for the health and other departments to rise to the occasion to ensure there are no deaths due to Covid-19 in the coming months,” the health minister said while interacting with superintendents of teaching hospitals under Director of Medical Education (DME) and hospitals under Telangana Vaidya Vidhan Parishad. Meanwhile, apart from GHMC area, which recorded 254 new cases, a high number of cases continue to be recorded in neighbouring districts Medchal-Malkajgiri and Rangareddy. Of 965 cases on Friday, 254 were from GHMC, 110 in Medchal Malkajgiri district followed by 97 in Rangareddy district. At present, there are 6,159 active cases out of which 2,622 were at home or institutional isolation. The recovery rate, on the other hand, stood at 97.46 % in the state compared to the national average of 93.7 %, the bulletin said. Reiterating that people must follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour as it is the only way to prevent the second wave of the virus from spreading further, director of public health Dr G Srinivasa Rao said, “The spread of Covid-19 virus depends a lot on the precautions being taken and behaviour of the general public towards it. People should avoid mass gatherings and stay safe.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cases-near-1000-eatala-says-war-like-situation/articleshow/81877703.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Be cautious while revamping Covid facilities: Collector to hospitals||NAGPUR: District collector Ravindra Thakare has urged private hospitals, especially the ones designated for Covid treatment, to be extra cautious while operationalizing additional Covid bed facilities. During an online meeting with 84 hospitals on Thursday, the collector also wanted the managements to ensure that additional infrastructure needed for operating Covid facilities does not lead to fatal increase of load on electrical fittings. In the backdrop of Mumbai Covid hospital fire that claimed 10 lives and soaring temperatures in Vidarbha, the collector wanted hospitals to initiate pre-emptive steps to prevent such incident happening here. Thakare said even as hospitals are increasing beds to tackle the Covid caseload, they must equally be cautious regarding the increased load on electrical fittings and cables, apart from other fire safety measures. “Any short-circuit or fire accident is the last thing which we can afford now as already panic is setting in with the rise in number of Covid cases,” he said. In order to service additional beds, hospitals should not bypass electrical safety protocol as linking more instruments to existing power supply without considering its load-bearing capacity could lead to overheating of cables or short-circuit, he pointed out. “With oxygen supply around in almost every other channel along with power cables, it may lead to a mishap. Hence, we need to be more cautious,” said Thakare. The collector also asked the hospitals to ensure their fire-fighting devices and mechanisms are updated and kept in ready-to-use condition. “We also want to ensure the hospital staffers are trained in fire safety skills with the help of NMC,” he said. Dr Anup Marar, convener of Vidarbha Hospitals Association, said considering that any capacity expansion will involve use of medical grade plastic oxygen pipelines rather than permanent copper ones, this advice is far-sighted and all hospitals need to be vigilant before establishing more wards.” It is a Catch-22 situation as adding beds has become a necessity to control mortality rate, he said. “Within a day to two, oxygen supply crisis will be sorted out and a 24x7 helpline for all hospitals to facilitate assistance for oxygen, medicines and lifesaving equipment would be made operational,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/be-cautious-while-revamping-covid-facilities-collector-to-hospitals/articleshow/81877706.cms||Soumitra Bose

About 16 cases of reinfection — 10 in the last three months — have been reported in different districts, including Bathinda, Fazilka, Ludhiana and Mohali. In these cases, the recovered patients developed symptoms and were tested positive for Covid-19 and had to undergo the treatment again. No death among such patients has been reported in the state. Samples of patients catching the infection for a second time have been sent for genome sequencing to ascertain whether they were carrying the old virus or some mutant strain. Along with the highly contagious UK variant, other mutations of concern have been reported in Punjab. Of the 874 samples sent for genome sequencing, 411 samples out of 588 examined so far have been found positive for the UK variant (B117) and two samples positive for the South African variant (N440K). Explaining the reasons for recovered patients again catching the infection, Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said the virus had strange phenomena that in some cases recovered patients do not develop its antibodies at all. This happens mostly among people with low immunity levels. “It has been found in a large number of recovered patients, who underwent antibodies test, that they did not develop any protective antibodies. It means that they did not develop immunity against the virus and are vulnerable to catching the infection again,” said Dr Bhaskar. He urged people to continue taking precautions – wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and hand hygiene – even after recovering. According to health experts, even in the recovered Covid patients who developed protection, the protective antibodies were not likely to remain in the body for more than six months. The antibody levels in the blood of recovered patients drop rapidly after the virus is cleared from the bodies. Society for Promotion of Ethical and Affordable Healthcare president Dr Ram Kumar said protection was still the best “shield” and people should continue taking precaution even after recovering and taking the Covid vaccine. Dr Kumar did not rule out the possibility of a high reinfection rate among the recovered patients as it has been over a year since the pandemic broke out. A lot of stress is being given on vaccinating vulnerable population as immunisation is being considered the key to suppressing the pandemic. Even as the pace of vaccination is slowly picking up in Punjab, it is yet to reach the desired level. As on April 1, the state administered 3.1 doses per 100 against the All-India average of 5. The performance of neighbouring state of Haryana is at par with the national average while states like Kerala, Rajasthan and Karnataka administered 7.2, 7 and 5.6 doses per 100. In Punjab first dose has been administered to 8,10,535 beneficiaries and the second dose to 1,11,633.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/swept-by-second-wave-punjab-battles-reinfection-too/articleshow/81885199.cms||Vinod Kumar

Around 60 stolen debit cards were recovered from them. The lack of work since the lockdown formed them to crime, the accused men told the crime unit of the Virar police. Ajay Shukla (33) and his accomplice Dharmendra Dubey (40) from Nalasopara along with Bablu Saroj (35), Jitendra Chamar (24) and Brijesh Chauhan (22), all Kandivli residents and auto rickshaw drivers have been remanded to police custody. Shukla who has acted in crime based serials like 'Crime Patrol' 'Savdhaan India' on television was not getting work since the lockdown last March. He and his friend Dubey, who dabbles in real estate, decided to steal debit cards from customers inside kiosks. They roped in their friends Saroj, Chamar and Chauhan, who were also facing financial crunch since the lockdown. Police said that the men have targeted victims inside kiosks in Mumbai, Vasai-Virar, Palghar, Thane, Bhiwani and Vapi in Gujarat. They used an auto rickshaw and two-wheeler to reach ATMs, look for customers who found it difficult to withdraw cash. They would steal the cards and exchange it with other stolen or outdated cards. They memorised the card PINs and withdrew cash from nearby ATMs. The accused have confessed to eight thefts of debit cards. Police said that details of the 60 ATM cards are being obtained. They have been booked under IPC section 420 (cheating) and 34 (common intention).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/tv-actor-replicates-reel-crimes-to-real-held-for-card-theft-in-mumbai/articleshow/81878396.cms||---

The court also directed the state government to take a call as to whether similar schools can be given the benefit of the Neet 7.5% quota, so that there will be some clarity from the next academic year. A medical aspirant D Arun filed a petition seeking to admit him in a medical course under the Tamil Nadu Admission to Undergraduate Courses in Medicine, Dentistry, Indian Medicine and Homeopathy on preferential basis to students of Government Schools Act, 2020. The single judge said the Rajah higher secondary school at Thanjavur in which the petitioner studied is presently managed by the district administration. The judge had said that since the court held that the school in which the petitioner studied is a government school within the meaning of Section 2(c) of the Act, the seat allocation made in favour of the petitioner is made absolute.Challenging the order, the state government had preferred this present appeal. A division bench of justices M M Sundresh and S Ananthi said that the student belongs to the scheduled caste community and his parents are pushcart vendors. The judges observed that though they are of the prima facie view that the school in question cannot be termed as a government school in the strict sense, they do not wish to overturn the ultimate relief granted by the single judge.The judges observed that the student has joined the college and therefore, at this stage, it is not feasible to allow the appeal, as no other candidate would be benefited, since the cut-off date is already over. Hence, the judges disposed of the appeal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-affirms-7-5-quota-seat-for-boy/articleshow/81878356.cms||Kaushik Kannan

---||Chandigarh||Haryana health officials on edge as NIV delays reports||CHANDIGARH: With Covid cases surging in the northern districts of Karnal, Panipat, Kurukshetra, Yamunanagar, Panchkula and Gurugram, delay on the part of National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune in sending reports of random sampling for UK strain has left health authorities on tenterhooks. Gurugram continues to top the daily case tally with the figure crossing 200 to 300. So is the case in Karnal, Kurukshetra, Yamunanagar and Panchkula. There has been a sharp rise in the number of cases even in Jind and Kaithal districts over the past week. Sources said health authorities and the state disaster management authority has written to the ministry of health and family welfare (MOHFW) and NIV to expedite reports of sampling. In January, six cases of Covid with UK strain were detected in Rewari, Karnal and Gurugram. Thereafter, the state started random sampling. Till last week, Haryana sent 1,073 samples, of which NIV has sent reports of 298, which were negative. Result of the remaining 769 is awaited. The delay forced the government to write to ICMR and MOHFW. “The steep surge in Punjab and presence of almost all the strains there forced us to ask NIV to expedite the results, so that we could plan and act accordingly. However, fast spread is the only threat or apprehension of the UK strain, else management of this variant is the same as that of a normal Covid patient,’’ said a senior official in the Haryana health department. Meanwhile, senior medicos associated with Covid diagnosis and management in Pt BD University of Health Sciences, PGIMS Rohtak have given the indication of suspected spread of the UK strain in northern districts as well as NCR. “There is no other reason for such fast spread in NCR and other districts. Only those districts which are neighbouring Punjab or those which have frequent visitors from Covid infested districts have seen a major surge,’’ they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-health-officials-on-edge-as-niv-delays-reports/articleshow/81877704.cms||Manvir Saini

The electricity department learnt on Friday that M Venkata Rao Infra Projects Pvt Ltd, the firm contracted for highway expansion work, damaged both the 33KV cables at 11 places and not two places that was initially thought. These cables supply power from Tivim substation to Porvorim, Mapusa, Saligao, Candolim and Anjuna. When the department tried to charge the line on Thursday night, they found that it was not holding the charge and suspected there was more damage caused to the cables. After using a separate fault-finding machine for several hours, they found that one high tension cable was damaged at six places, and the other at five. “We had a tough time. It is a very time-consuming process to locate the faults, and it takes around eight hours to join the cables,” an electricity department engineer said. He said this puts additional pressure on the department, which has to divert power supply from other areas to the affected areas. “We expect normal power supply to Bardez taluka to be restored post-midnight,” he said. Another engineer said joining the cable at multiple points has weakened it. “They (the road contractor) never consult the electricity department. They do the work very carelessly, and it is the people who are suffering,” he said. “The contractor must use a machine that detects where the live cables are, but they are negligent. The department has to pay a heavy penalty when it draws less electricity from power generating stations than was scheduled. Who will bear this cost to the exchequer?” he said. A Saligao resident said the chief minister’s intervention is necessary. “It looks like the department has no direct control over the contractor. The chief minister should intervene and understand that people are inconvenienced. The PWD should also put a condition in its work order that the contractor will (dig) in consultation with the electricity department,” he said. A Pilerne citizen affected by the power failure said underground cables were supposed to ensure better quality power supply to consumers. “The overhead lines would get affected by climatic conditions, trees falling, carbon formation, salinity and they continuously required maintenance,” he said. But underground cables don’t require maintenance and don’t have any problems until someone disturbs them. “These are man-made problems which can be avoided,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/36-hours-and-counting-bardez-waits-for-normal-power-supply/articleshow/81878384.cms||Lisa Monteiro

He said eleven states and even the Centre were implementing the state’s Rythu Bandhu scheme. “The government is spending about Rs 15,000 crore only on Rythu Bandhu scheme and no place in the country, including Gujarat, are providing 24x7 power supply to agriculture sector,” he said. He alleged that the Centre was not extending support to Telangana. On IT sector development, the minister said the Telangana government was focussing for expansion of IT to tier II towns and cities in the state. “When Telangana was formed, the IT exports were Rs 56,000 crore, now it has reached to Rs 1.40 lakh crore. This was possible with the vision and planning by the government,” he said. KTR addressed the public in Sathupally on Friday. He laid the foundation stone for an IT tower in Khammam, , inaugurated 2 BHK houses complex, and a modern bus station. Speaking on the occasion, he said the development in the past six years was possible due to ‘a stable government’ and planned development. KTR said CM K Chandrasekhar Rao had introduced schemes for every section of the society such as farmers, old-age people, women and students. Ministers Puvvada Ajay Kumar and Vemula Prashanth Reddy were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ktr-centre-not-extending-support-to-t/articleshow/81877705.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Declared brain dead, 57-year-old woman gives life to three||NEW DELHI: A 57-year-old woman, who was declared brain dead after suffering from serious injury in the head, saved lives of at least three people in her death. The woman (name not disclosed) was brought to Aakash Hospital in Dwarka on March 28. After she was declared brain dead, the hospital said, her family members consented to donate her organs. “According to the government’s allocation criteria, organs were harvested and transferred at 5am on March 29; one of her kidneys was given to a patient at Aakash Healthcare, Dwarka, itself while the other one was sent to Apollo Hospital for transplantation in a 52-year-old. The woman’s liver was used for transplantation in a 71-year-old man admitted at Medanta Hospital in Gurgaon,” the authorities at Aakash Healthcare said. They added that the cadaver donor’s corneas have been preserved in the eye bank of Shroff Eye Centre. Dr Vikas Agarwal, director and head of the department of urology, and kidney transplant at Aakash Healthcare, said the whole process of organ retrieval and transplant took around 20 hours. “It’s dismal to see that in India less than 1% of the braindead organs are utilised, while 99% are wasted due to lack of an organised and centralised system. The main cause is lack of consciousness or understanding of how important a donation can be for a person struggling for life,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/declared-brain-dead-57-yr-old-woman-gives-life-to-three/articleshow/81878394.cms||---

The AIADMK government should have urged it to act against the Sri Lankan government, but the ruling party did not do so. Charging the central government of ignoring Tamil Nadu, CPI’s D Raja said fishermen in the state continue to be affected. Demonetisation ruined the lives of many people. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that there would be a great change after demonetisation in the country, but the lives of people only became worse, he said and added that the Modi-led government is continuing to implement anti-peoples policies, which is affecting everyday lives. He said that the victory of the CPI candidate of Sivaganga Gunasekharan was a forgone conclusion as was the victory of the secular front in Tamil Nadu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/bjp-did-injustice-to-tamils-by-not-voting-against-sl-d-raja/articleshow/81878390.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Blood banks running dry amid Covid surge, vax drive||MUMBAI: Surge in Covid cases, cancellation of blood donation camps and the ongoing vaccination drive have contributed to the shortage of blood in the city, yet again. Supply in blood banks are slowly drying up, especially at government and civic centres. At some centres, the most common blood type O+ is also not available. With educational institutions and IT offices still shut and a latest directive prohibiting blood donation within 28 days of vaccination, the situation is likely to get worse. April-June have always been critical months for blood banks because of vacations. While the pandemic had led to a shortage even last year, the situation had improved in November-December, said an official from a civic centre. However, he added, the problems have compounded with the second wave. “Recently, many camps have been cancelled. Blood donors are again afraid to come due to the rise in Covid cases. The vaccination drive has also reduced the donor pool by 28 days. But there is no drop in blood demand as there is no lockdown,” said the official. As on April 1, the centre at KEM Hospital has only 38 units of blood, but there is no stock of O+. R N Cooper and Rajawadi hospitals have only 11 units left. St George Hospital, which has around 100 Thalassemia patients registered, has exhausted its O+ stock, said an official. Sion Hospital, which has over 250 such patients, has only 11 units. Red Cross is at zero for some time, he added. Some of the private blood banks do have good stock, but they are not ready to share, the official added. Health minister Rajesh Tope, in a public message, has made an appeal to citizens to donate blood at the nearest blood bank. He added that the state has blood only to suffice for the next eight days. The State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC) has asked organisations/societies to hold smaller camps to replenish supply. Arun Thorat, director, SBTC, said: “Colleges, IT offices and corporates were mainly contributing to the supply. These sectors are still shut due to the pandemic. We have made appeals to social and religious organisations, and mandals to hold smaller donation camps. We have also appealed to donors to donate blood before going for vaccination.” However, since two doses of vaccination must be taken 6-8 weeks apart, donors will not be able to give blood for two months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-blood-banks-running-dry-amid-covid-surge-vax-drive/articleshow/81878463.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Delhi||Delhi: Two kids critical after mother poisons them, kills herself||NEW DELHI: A 27-year-old woman allegedly tried to kill two of her children and then died by suicide at her residence in Ghitorni village on Thursday night. While the woman was declared brought dead, the children are critical and undergoing treatment. The woman is the wife of a Delhi Police constable who was in Rajasthan at the time of the incident. The couple had a strained relationship and the woman’s family has alleged harassment by the constable. Prima facie, it seems the children aged three months and three years were fed phenyl and she hung herself after drinking phenyl as well, police said. No suicide note has been recovered from the house. The incident came to fore when two calls were received at Vasant Kunj south police station around 8 pm from constable Sushil, posted at Vasant Vihar police station, reporting that his wife had latched the door of his room with his two sons and was not responding. On this, teams from both Vasant Kunj south and Vasant Vihar police stations rushed to Sushil’s house in Ghitorni. “The cops found that the house was latched from inside. They broke open the door and found the constable’s wife hanging from the ceiling fan. The couple’s two sons aged three years and three months were also found lying unconscious in the bathroom. All of them were rushed to hospital where the woman was declared brought dead while her two children were admitted for treatment,” said Ingit Pratap Singh, DCP, South-West. The officer said that while the condition of the elder son was stable, the younger son was still critical. “The woman’s body has been sent for postmortem. A forensics and crime team was also called on the spot for a detailed inspection,” the officer said. Police said Sushil got married in 2014, which is less than seven years, and therefore, the sub-divisional magistrate concerned was informed about the incident. The brother and father of the woman were also informed about the incident and they had reached the hospital. The family of the woman alleged that the constable would harass her and even raised dowry demands. It has also given a statement to the SDM. “It is being checked if the woman left any suicide note. Her family members and relatives are being questioned to know what could be possible reasons behind her taking such a drastic step. The matter is being probed from all possible angles. Legal action will be taken in the matter depending upon the complaint received from either side of the family,” the DCP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-kids-critical-after-mother-poisons-them-kills-herself/articleshow/81878534.cms||---

Several people have taken to social media seeking help regarding plasma or food services for those in quarantine. “About two weeks ago, we used to receive about four to five requests per day. The number of requests have now increased to 20 to 30 per day. We are able to fulfil 60% of these requests for plasma,” said Krishna Yedula, general secretary of Donate Plasma, an initiative launched by the Society for Cyberabad Security Council. Many people are also reaching out seeking food delivery services on social media to help put friends and family in need. “In my wife’s family, three people tested Covid-19 positive. We needed someone to deliver food for them from Bodhan (Nizamabad) to Kopparthi camp (7km).

Kanimozhi said since the people of Sivakasi would not vote for him, he was forced to contest from Rajapalayam. She said there is a disproportionate assets case before the court against Bhalaji though other ministers in AIADMK were also allegedly involved in acts of corruption. She sarcastically said that AIADMK’s campaign slogan “Vetri Nadai Podum Tamizhagam” was only with respect to the corruption aspect.

---||Hyderabad||CM K Chandrasekhar Rao likely to reshuffle Telangana cabinet next month||HYDERABAD: After one-and-a-half years, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is likely to reshuffle his cabinet. The CM, who is believed to be working on the rejig of his team, is set take a final call after April 17 Nagarjuna Sagar bypoll and MLC elections to be held next month. The last cabinet expansion was effected in September 2019 when KCR inducted six ministers. Sources in the TRS said the cabinet reshuffle will happen next month. Among those whose names are doing the rounds for a ministerial berth are legislative council chairman Gutha Sukender Reddy, former MP from Khammam Ponguleti Sudhakar Reddy (he is not a member of either house), former minister and Jadcherla MLA C Laxma Reddy, Khanapur MLA Rekha Naik, Hanamkonda MLA Dasyam Vinay Bhaskar, Chennur MLA Balka Suman and Achampet MLA Guvvala Balaraju. Though speculation is rife that KCR’s daughter Kalvakuntla Kavitha, who was elected as an MLC from Nizamabad local authorities constituency, may get a chance, insiders said two family members of KCR — son KT Rama Rao and newphew T Harish Rao — are already serving as ministers and bringing another family member into the cabinet could invite criticism from various quarters. There is also a buzz that the CM may spring a surprise by making former prime minister PV Narasimha Rao’s daughter Surabhi Vani Devi as a minister. She had won the graduates MLC seat recently. Rythu Bandhu Samithi chairman Palla Rajeshwar Reddy is also nursing hopes of bagging a cabinet berth, sources said. Sources said the CM is unhappy with track record of three to four ministers. Among them one minister is from Greater Hyderabad, while another hails from the erstwhile Karimnagar district. Similarly, some other ministers are likely to be shown the door so as to accommodate new faces. Sources said the CM would certainly keep an eye on social composition while rejigging his cabinet. During a couple of meetings, including the collectors’ conference, and on the floor of the assembly, KCR had openly commented that he got the assessment done on the performance of ministers. Panchayat raj minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao emerged as the best performer and one of the hardworking ministers in the assessment, it is learnt. Sources said the performance assessment is done every three months and the CM gets feedback mainly from the intelligence wing. “Apart from their track record in respective departments, party’s performance in the local bodies elections in their respective constituencies, recent byelections and GHMC elections will also be a factor for either removal of a minister or induction of a new face in the cabinet,” a senior TRS functionary said. The term of six MLCs — Sukender Reddy, deputy chairman Neti Vidyasagar, Akula Lalitha, Kadiyam Srihari, Mohammed Fareeduddin and chief whip Bodukudi Venkateshwarlu — is expiring in the first week of June this year. Sukender Reddy’s renomination to the upper house is almost certain, sources said. There is speculation that the CM is planning to induct one minister from among the MLCs. As of now, two MLCs — Mohammed Mahmood Ali and Satyavathi Rathod — are part of KCR’s team. If Vani Devi does not make the cut, she may be made the legislative council chairperson or vice-chairperson, sources said. Interestingly, there is no Madiga or Adivasi party leader serving as a minister in KCR’s cabinet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-likely-to-reshuffle-state-cabinet-next-month/articleshow/81877724.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Goa||IIT-Goa could have two small campuses close by||PANAJI: More than two months after chief minister Pramod Sawant announced the formation of a team to identify a new site to set up the permanent campus of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Goa, a land parcel is yet to be finalised by the team. Sources said the team, while combing for a suitable site, appear to have few choices, considering the requirement is of 250-300 acres of contiguous land with no encroachments. With options running out, one of the proposals under consideration is to provide two separate parcels of land within a 2-10km radius to set up the IIT, sources said. As there are few such examples in the country of an IIT having two campuses, in order to make the compromise worthwhile for the IIT, state officials are considering providing these two land parcels within urban limits. So far, the land parcels identified are located in interior areas like Dhargal in Pernem, Loliem in Canacona, Cotarli in Sanguem and Guleli in Sattari. Those in the know said that if such a proposal of setting up the IIT on two different land parcels is finalised, it will be a tough task to convince the Union education ministry’s site selection committee about this choice. However, officials are thinking of providing the twin sites in a prime area like the outskirts of Panaji to make it a worthwhile deal. “In such a case, all the classrooms, student facilities, administrative blocks, etc, will have to be located in the 100-acre plot. And the research facilities may be located in the second land area of around 50 acres,” a source said. Already, understanding the land constraints of a small state like Goa, the institute had agreed earlier to bring down its requirement from 300 acres to 250 acres. Those in the know state that to bring down the requirement further to 150 acres, the land offered will have to be prime area, so that space for faculty accommodation, etc, can be saved by not constructing facilities for this purpose and, instead, renting out space in the nearby urban area. Meanwhile, a contiguous plot of land in Bethoda is also under consideration. The option of locating the IIT’s permanent campus close to its temporary campus at Farmagudi is being given a thought as well, sources said. A site near the new airport at Mopa too is on the state’s radar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/iit-goa-could-have-two-small-campuses-close-by/articleshow/81878397.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Delhi||Angles of change: Cones to make intersection safer in Delhi||NEW DELHI: The traffic intersection at Delhi Gate is turning pedestrian-friendly with the use of cones and painted structures to demarcate the walking zone. The month-long trial started on Friday. While conducting a survey of roads, intersection and road signage, Delhi traffic police (DTP) was advised to make some changes at Delhi Gate by experts of World Resources Institute (WRI), the survey collaborator. Netaji Subhash Road, which is a four-lane road, narrows to two lanes here, and this has caused five fatal accidents in the past two years. Now pedestrian-dedicated areas have been earmarked here, with vehicular movement aligned with the use of cones. A traffic officer claimed on Saturday that the response of the public to the changes has been positive. “We had deployed a traffic inspector there. Other officers will continue to be posted there. We want the intersection in this busy central Delhi area to be pedestrian friendly,” the officer said. “We request the pedestrians to use the earmarked crossings and follow the traffic light cycles.” The officer added, “Netaji Subhash Road has been reduced to two lanes further up to ensure vehicles move in an aligned manner. The width of the road was reduced to make more space for the pedestrians. Many people came to us and said they were happy with the changes we had made for the smooth movement of pedestrians and vehicles.” Cones, barricades and planters will be placed on the stretch to carry out temporary infrastructure changes to test the new traffic design. Motorists travelling towards the Delhi Gate intersection from either direction are advised to slow down, drive safely, follow the traffic rules and adhere to the temporary installations. Police said they should abide by the speed limits around the junction to avoid mishaps. The pedestrians, similarly, are advised to use the marked crossings and follow the traffic light cycles. The attempt at the new system is to convert the big traffic junction into a more manageable, efficient and safer stretch for road users by removing the residual spaces. Safer pedestrian crossings will be marked with the shortest distance possible with refuge islands as waiting areas. Barricades will also be placed to discourage wrong-side and high-speed traffic movement in slip lanes and the service lanes. The trial will capture and compare the before and after data on various parameters. Long-term measures will be suggested based on the analysis of such date to permanently redesign the junction and align the street for improved safety. However, no diversion or blockade of roads is envisaged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/angles-of-change-cones-to-make-intersection-safer/articleshow/81878475.cms||---

The police recovered illegally possessed 162gram of charas and Rs 35,000 cash from his possession, he added. The accused was booked under sections of NDPS Act, while NCB Mumbai and Mumbai police were informed of Danish’s arrest in Kota, he said. In initial interrogation, the accused revealed that he dealt in illegal drug trade of charas, ganja, MD and other drugs and that he himself was an addict. He further admitted that he was on the run after NCB Mumbai raided an illegal drug unit in Dongri in Mumbai on March 25 this year and arrested his two drug peddlers, Rafiq and Chandrashaker, the SP said.

Speaking to TOI, Dr M Raja Rao, superintendent of the hospital said that 17 was the total number of deaths reported from Gandhi on that day and not all of them were Covid-related. “There are both Covid and non-covid deaths reported on Thursday. Out of the total, five were Covid-19 deaths and the remaining 12 were related to other co-morbidities. In fact, two of them were brought dead,” said Dr Rao. He explained that even prior to Covid-19, deaths in Gandhi Hospital stood between 25 and 30 per day and on certain days it even shot to 45. “In 2019 before the pandemic started, we used to have an average of 35 to 40 deaths every day. This is the case in all government hospitals because all terminally ill patients and patients who are critical are pushed to these hospitals. In the last year, since this hospital was turned into an exclusive centre to treat only coronavirus cases, we used to have a maximum of 12 cases a day,” Rao said. There are 1,890 beds in Gandhi Hospital out of which 1,500 are ICU and oxygen supported. As on Friday, a total of 11 regular beds, 19 oxygen beds and 108 ICU supported beds were occupied.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/5-of-17-deaths-due-to-covid-gandhi-head/articleshow/81877742.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) has allotted 27.5 acres to the 40-year-old management institute in Sector 22E. The institute is most likely to start enrolling students from 2024, the year the Jewar airport is also slated to be launched. This is the second prestigious B-school to announce a campus in NCR this year after IIM-Rohtak, which has decided to open a centre in Gurgaon. “We finalised the lease on Thursday. It is a 27.5 acre plot in YEIDA’s Sector 22E. Narsee Monjee is counted among the prestigious B-Schools of the country and we are hopeful that by bringing the institute close to NCR, it would serve the purpose of local students and help them access high quality management education,” said Arun Vir Singh, the CEO of YEIDA. NMIMS said its large student base in north India prompted it to start a campus in the Noida region. “Over 50% of our enrollments on the Mumbai campus are from north India. So, we decided to open a campus in the Noida region because that would cater to the student base in the north. We have signed the land deal and construction will start after we are handed the plot,” Amrish Patel, president of NMIMS, told TOI over phone from Mumbai, “We will not start enrollments in large numbers, but only with a few hundred intakes. We will build a full facility in a few years. All our branches of studies will be offered in the future from the campus here,” he added. NMIMS was set up in 1981 at Vile Parle in Mumbai. It is deemed to be a university and offers multiple disciplines through its 17 specialised schools. It has more than 17,000 students and about 750 faculty members. The NMIMS management is looking at 2024 to open the institute as it will coincide with the launch of the Noida International Airport. “The government is also focused on 2024 for all-round development of the area. That is when the Noida airport is likely to start. We want to open the doors of our institute at that time as the YEIDA area will have become much more developed by then,” said Jagdish B. Parikh, the joint treasurer of NMIMS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/leading-b-school-will-open-a-noida-campus/articleshow/81878446.cms||Sharmila Bhowmick

Unlike other human coronaviruses that attack the lower respiratory tract causing severe illness, the Covid-19 virus mostly stays in the upper respiratory tract (nose and mouth). Thus, it is easy to dislodge the virus through gargling and nasal irrigation by salt water. However, in severe cases of Covid-19, where the virus has invaded the lower respiratory tract or lungs, gargling does not help. A research study by teams from Dr Reddy’s Institute of Life Sciences, HCU campus, Hyderabad, Malla Reddy Medical College for Women, Hyderabad, and MNR Dental College and Hospital, Hyderabad, reveals that this simple technique is beneficial for people, who are in home quarantine, or who cannot visit a physician. According to them, while there is limited clinical evidence on the curative or preventive role of saline water gargling and nasal irrigation, research studies provide compelling support to their applicability in the current crisis. The result of the study was published in the recent issue of scientific journal, Explore. They said a recent post-hoc analysis of Edinburgh and Lothians Viral Intervention Study (ELVIS) gives a "compelling support to the applicability of gargling and nasal irrigation. This method is simple, economical, practically feasible, and globally implementable strategy with therapeutic and prophylactic value". According to the researchers, the common salt (sodium chloride) present in saline water inhibits replication of a range of DNA and RNA viruses, including the human coronavirus. This is because the salt when mixed with water results in a solution called hypochlorous acid. "The primary outcome of this study was a reduction in the duration of illness. Recent in vitro evidence in a separate study showed that 1.5% salt causes 100% inhibition of replication of the novel coronavirus. Another study revealed even plain water gargling is competent in preventing upper respiratory tract infection, indicating mechanical detachment of viruses as a possible effect of gargling," they added.

This is to tackle the growing short supply as Covid cases peak across the state, including Nagpur. The FDA minister is also contemplating permission to fit siren and emergency lights on jumbo oxygen tankers in every district for free and fast movement, since transportation too has become a tricky challenge. Shingne has also asked the commercial manufacturers of oxygen to ensure 80% of their output is sent for clinical purpose only as of now. With an anticipated rise in Covid cases later this month, Shingne has urged collectors across the state to either stock up on oxygen even while meeting the daily needs, or make alternative arrangements to ensure uninterrupted supply in the time of crisis. The FDA minister has also asked his department staffers to sacrifice leaves to fight the present crisis and also join hands with the district administrations to coordinate supply of oxygen and drugs like Remdesivir. District collector Ravindra Thakare said a new air filling plant is coming up at Butibori which would produce additional 550 jumbo oxygen cylinders. “We have got 60 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen from Bhilai on Thursday but have requested the collector of Durg to ensure daily supply of at least 80 metric tonnes,” he said. “We are running short of tankers and looking to take some on rent and also convert some other gas carriers,” he said. Shingne said the requirement, demands and supply of oxygen of each district across the state is being monitored, coordinated and regulated from the central control room at the FDA headquarters at Bandra in Mumbai. “The resident district collectors (RDC), on behalf of collectors, are being assigned the responsibility to alert and convey to the central control rooms oxygen demand, supply and stocks in their districts. The control rooms would try to arrange for the required oxygen supply to meet the requirement,” he said. Two health department officials have also joined the central control room to collaborate with FDA. “We are increasing the air-filling plants at many places and also trying to increase the fleet of tankers by converting carriers of other chemical (cryogenic) gases for oxygen. Some jumbo vehicles are also being procured for all divisions, including Nagpur, which also supplies it’s neighbouring divisions,” said Shingne. “Two cylinder manufacturing companies have been requested to give us priority in delivery,” said the FDA minister. The FDA minister also said Nagpur-based Inox limited, a manufacturer of liquid oxygen, has been requested to expedite it’s maintenance work and return to production at the earliest. “We will arrange for additional oxygen supply from Bhilai,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-level-control-room-tracking-oxygen-issues-fda-min/articleshow/81877730.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Madurai||In Bodi’s hinterlands, villagers know nothing about caste sops||Theni: Set against rocky mountains of the Western Ghats, Sannasipuram in the heart of Bodinayakkanur constituency is a picturesque village surrounded by sugarcane fields. Holding up AIADMK flags, plastic ‘two leaves’ with pictures of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa and flower petals in caps, the villagers await their candidate. Deputy chief minister and AIADMK’s Bodi candidate O Panneerselvam arrived around 4.30pm, after offering prayers at a ‘Kaliamman’ temple at the junction of two roads. Appearing campaign-worn but upbeat, he gets on to the open vehicle, flanked by local PMK, BJP and TMC functionaries, to seek votes. OPS is addressed as ‘Ammavin arasiyal vaarisu’ (Amma’s political heir) and ‘Mannin Mainthan’ (son of the soil) by the woman speaking on the public address system in his campaign vehicle. It is welcomed with loud claps and cheering. “I will build a proper temple for the village and take care of drinking water problems,” Panneerselvam promised the villages after praying at the small Vinayaga shrine that has no walls or roof. The AIADMK coordinator has been exploring the Bodi hamlets again to seek out voters for their support. He is a familiar face to villagers, “a heavy-weight, who would do their bidding”. As his convoy weaves through the dusty narrow streets, he halts at the occasional village to make a speech that lasts 20 minutes where he details all the achievements of his government with a stress on freebies like free gas cylinders and washing machine. Women, youths and children give him the traditional ‘poorna kumbh’ welcome. There is a sense of grandeur emphasized by the flowers and petals strewn on his path, the OPS cutouts held up by women, youth and children and the small digital screens that play promotional films on OPS. “It will be a tough fight,” said P S Dorairaj, standing in front of his tuck shop at Anakkarapatti as the cavalcade passed by him to stop a short distance away. “Considering my support is for the DMK, I still say it will be a close finish (for OPS and his DMK rival Thanga Tamilselvam, a former party colleague),” he said pointing to the flex board above his shop that had DMK president M K Stalin’s picture and his party’s campaign slogan.  As the OPS convoy makes a grand entry into Meenakshipuram village with sizeable Devendrakula Vellalar members, S Podraj, a daily wager, holding his grandson, listens to OPS speaking. So how did he greet the news of the reclassification of certain sub-sects under the Devendrakula Vellalar community. “We are not aware,” said Podraj. Neither do they know anything about the 10.5% internal reservation for the vanniyar community. In this caste hotbed, Sasikala’s name crops up only in connection with her nephew T T V Dhinakaran’s AMMK and his candidate, P Muthusamy, in the fray in Bodi. But, what has added that extra zing to the fight is that all the three main candidates come from the same stable, the AIADMK.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/in-bodis-hinterlands-villagers-know-nothing-about-caste-sops/articleshow/81878438.cms||Jaya Menon
---||Goa||Government finally finds judge willing to be Lokayukta||PANAJI: After a prolonged delay, finally, the state government has appointed retired Bombay high court justice Ambadas Joshi as new Goa Lokayukta. Chief minister Pramod Sawant said that the high court has given its consent to appoint Joshi as the Lokayukta. “We have issued the order of appointment of Joshi as the new Lokayukta,” he said, adding that Joshi hails from Nagpur. tnn Leader of opposition Digambar Kamat told TOI that he has written to the chief minister asking him to first strengthen the Goa Lokayukta Act and then go ahead with the appointment of a new Lokayukta. On March 9, former high court judge U V Bakre, who is currently the chairman of the Goa Human Rights Commission (GHRC), withdrew his consent to appoint him as Lokayukta citing “personal reasons”. The high court had directed the state to appoint a new anti-corruption ombudsman by December 2020. Advocate Aires Rodrigues had approached the court seeking a direction to the government to appoint a Lokayukta. The term of the previous Lokayukta PK Misra ended on September17, 2020. Misra also held the position of chairman of GHRC before being appointed as the Lokayukta. In January, the high court extended the time-frame by two months for the state government to appoint a new Lokayukta. The state government had approached the high court seeking an extension after being unable to find a retired Supreme Court judge or retired high court chief justice willing to move to Goa to take up the post. After the government failed to get consent to appoint a Supreme Court judge or a retired chief justice of the high court, the state amended the act so that a retired high court judge could be appointed as the Lokayukta. Stung by several indictments by the Lokayukta in cases involving corruption by public functionaries, the government amended the Act to severely dilute the powers of the institution. The amendments have omitted provisions enabling complaints against public functionaries on allegations of nepotism, lack of integrity, mal-administration and improper or corrupt motive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-finally-finds-judge-willing-to-be-lokayukta/articleshow/81878428.cms||---

Also, starting from Monday, all hotels and restaurants across Aurangabad will be allowed to cater to 50% of their operational capacity. However, they will have to shut down the establishment for dine-in by 8pm. The decision to grant relaxations under ‘Mission Begin Again’ was taken in a joint meeting that was attended by district collector Sunil Chavan, Aurangabad commissioner of police Nikhil Gupta, superintendent of police Mokshada Patil, zilla parishad CEO Mahesh Gondavle and nodal officer Shrimant Harkal. “After 8pm, restaurants and hotels can only serve takeaways,” Chavan said. The list of decisions taken during the meeting also include setting up of ward-wise squads to keep a check on those violating Covid norms. These squads will also keep an eye on market places including weekly and daily markets from rural as well as urban areas. The authorities have unanimously decided to initiate action against vehicle owners for violating the laid down norms of carrying more than the permissible number of passengers or commuters in their cars or buses. All the vehicles have been permitted to operate with 50 per cent of their sitting capacity. In addition to this, five dedicated squads have been formed to ensure that different business establishments not only follow the Covid norms, but also shut down as per the deadline. Action will also be initiated against business establishments flouting the laid down norms so that it sends a strong message to others. Apart from this, the food and drug administration (FDA) has been given a target of initiating action against about 20 business establishments that violate the norms. Aurangabad central MLA Pradeep Jaiswal said, “Banning marriage ceremonies will have a direct impact on different service providers, including cooks, musicians, decorators, event managers,so we raised the issue with the district collector.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/50-wedding-guests-curbs-on-hotels-eased-but-aurangabad-to-keep-guard/articleshow/81875630.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Nagpur||Soon, dist-level control room to help keep track of vacant beds||Nagpur: The district administration is set to commence a central control room on the lines of NMC’s Covid dashboard amid sudden spike in positive cases, with a projection of a possible peak later this month. District collector Ravindra Thakare, who was busy supervising the vaccination drive and monitoring Covid-related situations on Friday, said the district-level central control room would be functional soon and extend assistance to the rural population to locate a hospital amid shortage of bed. The control room will have 10 phone lines for communications meant for receiving and relaying information related to the latest status of vacant beds in Covid hospitals across the district. Thakare said the rural population is often referred to city hospitals but mostly remain clueless regarding availability of beds. “We have requested private Covid hospitals to share information about vacant and engaged beds. The hospitals are already updating their bed status with NMC’s dashboard . They can do the same with us too. This information will help the rural population get pinpointed location of a hospital where they can get admission,” he said. According to a district administration source, the demand for updated information regarding bed availability was raised by people’s representatives and some officials during the Covid review meeting at the office of the divisional commissioner last week. “Apart from public, the central control room will also help district health officials and in-charges of primary health centres (PHC) know the exact position of beds in hospitals. They can direct and guide their patients accordingly. In rural areas, Covid positive patients are more dependant on health officials for their future course of treatment if they require to be referred to city hospitals,” said the official. Thakare said he has also asked hospitals to share their demands and requirements for oxygen along with sales and purchase of Remdesivir. “We already have collaborative support of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which will keep a track of oxygen use and requirement, along with the stock position of Remdesivir from the central control room,” the collector added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/soon-dist-level-control-room-to-help-keep-track-of-vacant-beds/articleshow/81877764.cms||Soumitra Bose

Health officials meanwhile said that a sharp increase in Covid-19 testing compared to previous months and poor compliance with safety norms despite strict preventive measures have led to the rise and urged for better co-operation from public.In Madurai district, out of the 105 fresh cases to be recorded on Friday, 87 were from within densely populated corporation limits. In the past one week, more than 300 new Covid-19 cases have been reported in the district and Madurai now has the highest number of active Covid-19 cases in south TN. Currently, about 3,500 samples are being tested for Covid-19 daily in Madurai with the average positivity rate between 2% and 3%.Apart from Madurai, Tirunelveli and Kanyakumari have also been witnessing a sharp rise in fresh cases. Tirunelveli reported 78 new cases on Friday, which was second highest in the region after Madurai. “There are no clusters as such but we are ensuring that all contacts are closely monitored and tested, which is leading to there being a rise in cases since often close contacts also test positive if one person tests positive. Covid-19 testing has also been increased to around 1,500 per day compared to just 600-700 previously,” said a health official from Tirunelveli. The official added that hotspots are being identified and fever camps are also being organised.Similarly, in Kanyakumari as well, more than 50 cases were reported in a single day this week and in both Kanyakumari and Tirunelveli, the active cases have crossed 200, which is the highest after Madurai. “Covid-19 testing has been increased in Kanyakumari to around 2,000 now. Border check posts are also being closely monitored. However, the public are urged to co-operate as Covid-19 safety norms continue to be flouted by many,” said a district health official. With election campaigns also leading to huge crowds gathering, health officials across districts have found it difficult to monitor it. Officials said that despite collecting fines in lakhs, compliance with Covid-19 safety SOPs remains elusive. On Friday, the total fresh cases in the southern region were 374, the highest in the region since October 20. The two deaths reported were one each in Kanyakumari and Tenkasi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/after-madurai-cases-spike-in-tirunelveli-kanyakumari/articleshow/81878497.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

---||Goa||Goa’s positivity rate nears 14%, hospitals start filling up again||PANAJI: Goa’s case positivity rate for Covid-19 rose to 13.8% on Friday, as 280 more persons tested positive for the virus. As active cases rose to 1,913, hospital admissions too went up, as 39 persons were admitted on Friday. The rapidly rising positivity rate has experts worried, since as recently as on Sunday, Goa’s weekly positivity rate was 7.03%. “As a rule of thumb, one threshold for the percent positive being ‘too high’ is 5%,” according to the John Hopkins school of public health. The World Health Organisation (WHO), too, follows this upper limit, as it said last year that the rate should be under 5% for at least two weeks before governments consider reopening. But even with Goa’s rate far above that, the state government has flatly refused to strictly enforce Covid protocols or put any curbs on tourism, which went wild this past week with thousands of desi tourists flocking to Goa. As doctors and other citizens watched in alarm, cabinet minister Michael Lobo said that if the state enforced Covid SOPs, tourists won’t come. However, away from the unrestrained merriment in the clubs and along the beach belt — which is set to continue over the Easter weekend — Goa’s hospitals are again filling up. Goa Medical College (GMC) has around 80 patients, while over 100 are being treated at the South Goa district hospital. While GMC can accommodate around 200 patients, if the rate of infections remains this high, the existing bed capacity will soon fall short, experts warn. On Friday, Panaji breached the 200 case-mark, while the caseload in Margao rose to 188. Meanwhile, the state executive committee (SEC), under the chairmanship of chief secretary Parimal Rai, decided to “enforce strictly” all preventive protocols in the state. The SEC decision came several days after cases began rising, with severe warning signs coming from neighbouring Maharashtra ignored by the state administration. The North Goa collector even ignored a health department advisory to make an offshore casino micro containment zone after 31 staff members had tested positive. Now, after the conclusion of the long weekend that many feared would send Goa’s case rate soaring, the committee has directed district collectors to issue advisories to all possible crowded places, hotels, restaurants, gyms, marriage halls, industries, and mall operators to enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour and to undertake random checks to ensure strict adherence. The SEC decided that other hospitals and Covid care centres should be kept ready for receiving more patients in case the need arises, as health secretary Ravi Dhawan said that both district hospitals have more than half beds occupied. “Collectors were directed to identify hotels willing to function as paid Covid care centres for those who seek such facilities for institutional isolation,” an SEC member said. The health department, police and department of information and publicity have been asked to carry out aggressive awareness campaigns, and the SEC also said that Covid-appropriate behaviour must be enforced including by levying fines. The committee also urged the implementation of the track-test-treat protocol, and to ramp up testing facilities to ensure a higher testing rate and timely declaration of RT-PCR results to identify in a timely manner the number of positive cases. The SEC also emphasized on carrying out the vaccination drive more aggressively by encouraging public servants and others (as FLWs) who are involved in Covid management and those who are 45-years-old and above to opt for vaccination to build confidence amongst the general public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goas-positivity-rate-nears-14-hosps-start-filling-up-again/articleshow/81878509.cms||Bindiya Chari

The people’s representatives and authorities are blaming the soaring sand prices that is being controlled by the sand mafia. Also, the listed beneficiaries who have failed to meet the deadline for completing the construction of their houses have been served notices. Nanded-based BJP MLA Rajesh Pawar said, “Sand mafias are controlling the price due to which poor people are unable to complete their houses under the state as well as Centre’s housing schemes. The beneficiaries are being slapped with notices for failing to meet the deadline.” Terming illegal sand trading to be a parallel economy run by sand mafias in connivance with selected public servants from revenue and police department, Pawar had also resorted to hunger strike at secretariat during the last month’s assembly session. Shiv Sena MLA from Aurangabad Pradeep Jaiswal said apart from soaring sand prices, exodus of migrant workers due to the lockdown has also affected the construction of houses under the government scheme. Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan acknowledged the challenges faced by the beneficiaries in the past one year. “In the current fiscal, targets for completing the houses under the schemes will be met as sand will be legally available in abundance,” he said. Under PMAY, Aurangabad district had a target of completing 22,143 houses, but it ended up completing only 11,614 houses. Latur completed 6,518 houses out of its target of 10,968. Hingoli (6,711), Jalan (6,349), Osmanabad (3,459), Parbhani (4,155), Beed (9,673) and Nanded (19,947) have also fallen well short of their respective targets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/all-mwada-districts-fail-to-meet-pmay-targets/articleshow/81875633.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Though more than 25,000 healthcare workers have been vaccinated for Covid-19 in the district, there are still many who haven’t received the vaccine at all while some among them are yet to receive the second dose.In the last one week, more than 250 fresh cases have been recorded in Madurai district. With the rise in number of patients in hospitals, healthcare workers are also scared of getting the infection.. “There have been no Covid-19 cases among doctors recently. As of now, the patient load is manageable. However, if we have cases rising like last year, the burden and pressure on healthcare workers and hospitals will be immense. Public should be more responsible in Covid-19 prevention,” said Dr K Senthil, state president, Tamil Nadu Government Doctors Association (TNGDA). The doctor added that they are trying to motivate as much healthcare workers as possible to take the Covid-19 vaccine as there are some who are still reluctant.“This time we have the additional support of Covid-19 vaccine for prevention unlike last year. As Covid-19 cases rise, there is a need to exercise caution since those coming to a hospital are vulnerable and are already at risk. Those with symptoms are immediately asked to take a Covid-19 test,” said a doctor at a private multi-speciality hospital. Further, doctors are also wary in conducting deliveries and performing surgeries as some asymptomatic patients are testing positive when taking the Covid-19 test before undergoing the procedure. Though some private hospitals are insisting on tests for safety of both patients and healthcare staff, doctors reported poor acceptance from patients and kin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/as-virus-cases-increase-hosps-tighten-screening/articleshow/81878482.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

Sometime later, a fully-grown leopard was also found dead under mysterious circumstances about a kilometre away from the place where the farmer was attacked. Locals said that the area has at least three fully-grown leopards and the one that was found dead had apparently sustained serious injuries in a clash with another leopard about 15 days back. Forest officials as well as locals said that they are not sure if the leopard that attacked the farmer is the one that has been found dead or it was another wild cat. The farmer, Mahesh Motinge, was watering the jowar crop in his farm in gat number 165 when the leopard attacked him from behind. Though Motinge sustained injuries on the back, he somehow managed to escape from the clutches of the wild cat and survived the attack. Hearing his cries for help, farmers as well as workers from surrounding farms rushed to his rescue, following which the animal fled. Villagers said that they have been spotting movement of a leopard in the area for the last three days. They blamed the forest department staff for not paying heed to their complaints about spotting of leopards. Soon after Motinge was attacked by the big cat, the villagers gathered with sticks and axes and launched a search operation. Sometime later, a group of villagers spotted a seriously injured leopard in a farm situated in gat number 160. An alert was sent to the forest authorities, but by the time forest officials could reach the spot, the wild animal was already dead. A spot panchanama was carried out and the carcass was sent for autopsy to ascertain the exact cause of death..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/revisedaurangabad-farmer-injured-in-leopard-attack/articleshow/81875637.cms||Mohammed Akhef

A number of Covid cases were found in the department’s Aaykar Bhavan office at Seminary Hills too. A mass testing of the employees revealed that large part of the workforce in the department was infected. With a fortnight gone, the situation is slowly normalizing. A couple of branches of the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) were also sealed during the period, apart from some banks. Lately, the Dharampeth branch of Bank of Baroda was sealed due to rising number of Covid cases. This is being attributed to constant interaction with outsiders in course of work and at times negligence towards safety norms in general. Mass testing at offices is also bringing out high number of cases, said sources. The official data show that at least 54,000 persons in the working age group of 31 to 50 years were corona positive as on February end. This includes 34,000 men and 20,000 odd women. Another 34,000 in the age bracket of 15 to 30 years were positive. Some may be minors in this category. More than 54,000 in the over 50 years age group were also positive. Patients of working age group can be found in this category too. The impact is clearly seen at the workplaces. TOI talked to people in several offices to find Covid absence had hit almost everyone’s functioning. Having just 25% of workforce had already affected work. Around 60 employees have reported positive in last week at the Accountant General’s (AG) wing, said an official here. This is more than 10% of the total workforce. The AG’s office carries out audit of state government’s departments. A large number of persons falling sick has affected the audit and inspection work. They are hoping to be normal by December when reports have to be finalized, a source said. AG’s Office also has the accounts and entitlement wing, which maintains the pension and PF accounts of state government employees. Here, around 10 persons are reported positive. The offices are working at 25% staff strength. Covid has taken toll on working at offices of LIC, the public sector insurance behemoth too. A source said two branches were sealed recenty. Around 21 development officers (DOs) lost their life to Covid. “Though it is a small part of the overall number of DOs in the entire organization, it certainly is a loss for the concerned branch. Even some agents have passed away including some attached to our branch in Nagpur,” said the source. Office of Directorate of GST Intelligence (DGSSTI) at Nagpur has also not been able to take up operations as nearly half of its officers are down with Covid. A special branch of Central GST department, it conducts raids against defaulters. The office has 11 officers of whom four are affected. Cases were reported in PSUs like Western Coalfields Ltd (WCL) also. it has, however, not impacted the work, said an official here.

The accused resorted to the act after the boys trespassed into the mango orchard in search of a missing pet dog. On Thursday evening, two boys from Sai Nagar in Thorrur entered a mango orchard adjacent to the main road near Kantayapalem in search of their missing pet dog. The caretakers of the mango orchard, Bhanoth Yaku of Bothala Thanda and Bhanoth Ramulu of Hachu Thandam, caught the boys suspecting they had came to steal the mangoes. “The accused tied up the hands of the boys and hit them with sticks. They also resorted to the heinous act of stuffing cow dung in the mouths of the boys and smeared dung on their faces,” Mahabubabad SP N Koti Reddy said.

A research study covering four mega cities in India including Hyderabad has revealed that the overall health risk index of Hyderabad came down by 17% thanks to the restriction on the movement of motor vehicles. Any reduction in the health risk index means good quality air and fewer number of diseases linked to vehicular and industrial pollution. The cancer risk index for Hyderabad came down by 36.3% during the lockdown period. According to researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Hyderabad and Patna, and the National Institute of Technology, Warangal, though Hyderabad stood last among four major cities that include Delhi, Bengaluru and Kolkata in terms of reduction in health risk index, it is because Hyderabad is less polluted than the other cities of its size. The study published in the scientific journal, Environmental Research, showed that the maximum reduction in health risk index for Hyderabad was 17% as against 41% for Delhi, 31% for Bengaluru, and 19% for Kolkata. The chronic health index average value in Hyderabad dipped by 36.02% while the acute health index average value for the city came down by 28.36% in 2020 as compared to 2019. The study revealed that transportation is the main source of carbon pollution in Hyderabad with a total urban commuting load of particulate pollution of about 900 kg a day. However, the air pollution load came down considerably during the lockdown. According to researchers, the area around University of Hyderabad benefited the most. This area has high movement of vehicles thanks to IT sector and the outer ring road. The study said air pollution in Hyderabad reduced with a drop of of “49.82%, 12.95%, and 21.52% in values of photochemical ozone creation potentials (POCP), acidification potential (AP), and eutrophication potential (EP) respectively." At industrial zone of IDA Pashamylaram station, POCP decreased from 1012 micrograms per cubic metre to 415 micrograms per cubic metre. Acidification potential fell from 56.02 micrograms per cubic metre to 34.11 micrograms per cubic metre. Health risk indices, cancer risk, and chronic health index plunged by 20.22% and 22.25%, study said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lockdown-cut-health-risk-index-in-hyd-by-17-cancer-risk-by-36-researchers/articleshow/81877801.cms||Syed Akbar

The automobile workers were among the 69,845 beneficiaries who received the vaccine in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) on Friday. “The response from the industrial units has been exceptional. The likes of Tata Motors have full-fledged medical units available on their premises, which made the task of vaccination quite easy. More such inoculation drives will be conducted on various other industry’s premises in the next few days,” said Rajesh Patil, commissioner, PCMC. Not only the Tata employees, their family members were also allowed to the take shot. “We have covered 1,460 beneficiaries (employees and families) within two days of the vaccination drive,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-vax-drive-goes-to-tata-motors-pune-campus/articleshow/81878538.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Hyderabad||Despite pandemic, tipplers help Telangana scale dizzy highs||HYDERABAD: The excise department is laughing all the way to the bank despite the pandemic and Covid-induced lockdown in 2020-21 financial year. Revenue from liquor sales seem to have been unaffected as the state netted the highest ever annual income of Rs 26,938 crore at a time when overall revenues of the state took a nosedive and all other sectors were adversly hit. Liquor shops were shut from March 22 to May 4 last year when Covid-19 was at its peak and positive cases surged. “Had the shops not been closed, the income would have even touched Rs 30,000 crore,” an official said. In 2019-20, the department earned Rs 20,483 crore. The state also saw a record sale of liquor at Rs 2,764 crore in December last year as guzzlers and liquor sellers helped the state set a new excise revenue record. In November 2020, sales were to the tune of Rs 2,567 crore. Liquor sales in the state hover around Rs 1,700 crore, which is the average monthly sale.  When Telangana was formed in 2014, it earned Rs 10,238 crore from liquor sales. Looking at the liquor revenue figures from the time the state was formed seven years ago, there has been a 250 per cent rise in sales. “Till now, the excise department has collected Rs 1.23 lakh crore (up to financial year 2020-21) from liquor sales in these last seven years,” a senior official said. Surpassing all expectations, liquor sales and revenues continue to zoom year on year despite an increase of 5% to 20% in prices of beer and other brands of hard liquor. Officials attribute this to growing demand from tipplers to different brands and high-end varieties. The excise department was able to plug loopholes, curb illicit liquor trade and check non-duty paid liquor sales. “We maintain a strict vigil along borders to check smuggling of liquor into Telangana from neighbouring states. Hassle-free licence and permit systems have also contributed to increase in revenues,” officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/despite-pandemic-tipplers-help-t-scale-dizzy-highs/articleshow/81877845.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The national average is 6.3%. On March 30, the seven-day average total positivity rate in the city was 13.5% and was second after Maharashtra with 23%. At that time, the seven-day average daily growth percentage was 1.03%. “Even while Chandigarh has slipped to a third slot in its positivity rate, it is not due to decrease in cases, but another state having more numbers comparatively. So, this is the time to have an effective contact tracing, timely reporting of RTPCR tests and treatment,” said a public health expert in PGI. Following the nudge from the ministry of health and family welfare, RTPCR testing has increased to 80% in last four days. It was earlier flailing at 40% for a while. Tests per million per day remain consistent, with the UT occupying the third place since the last 15 days after Delhi and Jammu and Kashmir. “Cases in the city have been rising since March 17, when 200 infections per day were reported. We were expecting to wait for the incubation period of two weeks to analyse. The consistent rise clearly indicates that the numbers will rise until this month as it is a second peak,” said a public health expert in the PGI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/srinagar/at-13-8-citys-weekly-positivity-rate-3rd-highest-in-country/articleshow/81885119.cms||Shimona Kanwar

---||Kolkata||Amit Shah promises Adivasi status to 11 Gorkha communities||KALCHINI/SITALKUCHI: The BJP government was working on granting Adivasi status to 11 Gorkha communities, Union home minister Amit Shah announced on Friday during his north Bengal tour. The Gorkhas have for long been demanding the adivasi status for multiple communities, including Gurung, Bhujel, Mangar, Newar, Jogi, Khas, Rai, Sunwar, Thami, Yakkha and Dhimal.  Shah’s announcement was aimed at taking the wind out of Gorkha leader Bimal Gurung’s sail ahead of polls in three seats in the Hills and five seats in the foothills, where Gorkhas have a presence. Shah, who also assured land pattas to 3.5 lakh tea garden workers in the Dooars, said the BJP government would hand over the deeds by November, in a bid to trump a similar promise from chief minisater Mamata Banerjee. He also hinted at a wage revision in tea gardens.  “The wage in tea gardens stood at Rs 176 in 2017. We have plans to take it to Rs 350,” Shah said, adding Prime Minister Narendra Modi had allocated Rs 1,000 crore for the welfare of tea grower families. The Union home minister also lined up a number of development projects for north Bengal: an AIIMS and a central university in Cooch Behar, a Rs 10,000 crore-support to step up health infrastructure in north Bengal, an annual Rs 2,000-crore fund for the development of north Bengal and Rs 500 crore for Cooch Behar Ras Mela.  “This place is 700km from Kolkata. But for Mamata Didi, the place is over 7,000km away. North Bengal has been discriminated against. That is why Didi is afraid of the people in north Bengal. We are going to win 50 out of the 60 seats that went to polls in the first two phases. But in north Bengal, we expect all the 50-odd seats. North Bengal will get topmost priority the day BJP comes to office in Bengal,” Shah said. At Sitalkuchi in Cooch Behar — the home to refugees from East Pakistan and Bangladesh—the Union home minister reiterated the BJP government’s resolve to “honour” the refugees with citizenship. At the same time, he talked tough on infiltrators. “Do you endorse infiltration? The infiltrators are taking away job opportunities of the youths and eating the rations of the poor. Do you believe Mamata Didi can stop infiltration? Give the BJP a chance in Bengal. I can assure you, we will stop infiltration,” Shah said. Having said that, Shah turned his focus on the Rajbanshis in Cooch Behar who form a majority in the district.  Shah told the gathering that a BJP government would raise the Narayani Sena battalion in the Army with Rajbanshi youths.  He also promised to build a Rs 250-crore statue for Koch-Rajbanshi icon Panchanan Barma, apparently to massage community feelings. Shah topped it all with the resolve to punish the culprits who tortured Rajbanshis. “After assuming office on May 2, the BJP government will start putting tormentors, coal mafias, sand mafias and cattle smugglers behind bars,” Shah said. Taking on the Bengal CM, Shah said, “I come to hear Trinamool slogans khela hobe, khela hobe. People of Bengal are no longer scared of khela hobe. Instead, mothers and sisters in places chased away Trinamool workers. BJP workers are now ready to take on the Trinamool.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/shah-promises-adivasi-status-to-11-gorkha-communities/articleshow/81877932.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya
---||Goa||Power mantri on short fuse over ‘reckless’ highway work||PANAJI: Power minister Nilesh Cabral on Friday said he would take up with chief minister Pramod Sawant the issue of M Venkata Rao Infra Projects Pvt Ltd puncturing underground power cables on several occasions, even as he claimed that highway expansion work by the contractor was being carried out in a “reckless manner”. “I will speak to the chief minister on Monday. This is not the first time the contractor has damaged our cables. The problem has continued for almost 36 hours for no fault of ours,” he told TOI when asked about what action would be taken against the contractor. Cabral further alleged that work is being carried out without taking the electricity department into confidence and without informing the department even after the cables are damaged. “As a result, it takes almost three to four hours to locate the fault by physically covering the 14km stretch with a machine, then digging up the portion that was covered with mud and then joining the cables. It’s a very difficult and time-consuming job. Our work would have been easier if the contractor had informed us where the cables have been cut and we could have taken immediate action,” he told TOI. “It’s not the first time the contractor has damaged the cables. We have told them we will post our line staff but their people don’t tell us when they’re starting work. They’ve also damaged the water pipeline,” Cabral said. Power is being supplied on a rotation basis to the affected villages, he said, adding that the electricity department has asked hotels to restrict their power use so that domestic consumers are not badly affected. “I have told all our seniors to be present on site until the problem is rectified,” Cabral said. The contractor for the ongoing highway expansion work in North Goa—M Venkat Rao Infra Projects Pvt Ltd—on Thursday punctured two 33KV underground power cables leaving most of Bardez taluka without electricity. The power supply that went off at around 12.30pm was not restored in most parts till late night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/power-mantri-on-short-fuse-over-reckless-highway-work/articleshow/81878543.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Goa||Goa’s positivity rate nears 14%, hospitals start filling up again||PANAJI: Goa’s case positivity rate for Covid-19 rose to 13.8% on Friday, as 280 more persons tested positive for the virus. As active cases rose to 1,913, hospital admissions too went up, as 39 persons were admitted on Friday. The rapidly rising positivity rate has experts worried, since as recently as on Sunday, Goa’s weekly positivity rate was 7.03%. “As a rule of thumb, one threshold for the percent positive being ‘too high’ is 5%,” according to the John Hopkins school of public health. The World Health Organisation (WHO), too, follows this upper limit, as it said last year that the rate should be under 5% for at least two weeks before governments consider reopening. But even with Goa’s rate far above that, the state government has flatly refused to strictly enforce Covid protocols or put any curbs on tourism, which went wild this past week with thousands of desi tourists flocking to Goa. As doctors and other citizens watched in alarm, cabinet minister Michael Lobo said that if the state enforced Covid SOPs, tourists won’t come. However, away from the unrestrained merriment in the clubs and along the beach belt — which is set to continue over the Easter weekend — Goa’s hospitals are again filling up. Goa Medical College (GMC) has around 80 patients, while over 100 are being treated at the South Goa district hospital. While GMC can accommodate around 200 patients, if the rate of infections remains this high, the existing bed capacity will soon fall short, experts warn. On Friday, Panaji breached the 200 case-mark, while the caseload in Margao rose to 188. Meanwhile, the state executive committee (SEC), under the chairmanship of chief secretary Parimal Rai, decided to “enforce strictly” all preventive protocols in the state. The SEC decision came several days after cases began rising, with severe warning signs coming from neighbouring Maharashtra ignored by the state administration. The North Goa collector even ignored a health department advisory to make an offshore casino micro containment zone after 31 staff members had tested positive. Now, after the conclusion of the long weekend that many feared would send Goa’s case rate soaring, the committee has directed district collectors to issue advisories to all possible crowded places, hotels, restaurants, gyms, marriage halls, industries, and mall operators to enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour and to undertake random checks to ensure strict adherence. The SEC decided that other hospitals and Covid care centres should be kept ready for receiving more patients in case the need arises, as health secretary Ravi Dhawan said that both district hospitals have more than half beds occupied. “Collectors were directed to identify hotels willing to function as paid Covid care centres for those who seek such facilities for institutional isolation,” an SEC member said. The health department, police and department of information and publicity have been asked to carry out aggressive awareness campaigns, and the SEC also said that Covid-appropriate behaviour must be enforced including by levying fines. The committee also urged the implementation of the track-test-treat protocol, and to ramp up testing facilities to ensure a higher testing rate and timely declaration of RT-PCR results to identify in a timely manner the number of positive cases. The SEC also emphasized on carrying out the vaccination drive more aggressively by encouraging public servants and others (as FLWs) who are involved in Covid management and those who are 45-years-old and above to opt for vaccination to build confidence amongst the general public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goas-positivity-rate-nears-14-hosps-start-filling-up-again/articleshow/81878548.cms||Bindiya Chari

According to DCP (south) Atul Thakur, the accused used to call up US nationals on the pretext of providing them government grants for unemployed and handicapped persons. “The accused impersonated US government officials during the calls. They charged a few in lieu of their ‘services’. Once the fee was wired, they used to cut contact and go underground,” DCP Thakur said. The prime accused have been identified as Kamal Das and Roshan Singh. A raid was conducted on the premises based on a tip-off. About 25 computer systems and some routers were found to be used for calling through internet with the help of headphones. Investigation has revealed that Kamal Das used to get information of the US citizens from his sources and passed on the data to his employees. “The employees of the call centre used various softwares and operated multiple VOIP accounts to cheat the US nationals. In order to get the payment, they asked the victims to purchase Google Play Card, Ebay Gift Cards, Amazon Gift Cards, etc. and share the coupon code,” DCP Thakur said. Thereafter, they used to send these coupon codes to their other sources and in return, they received amounts in INR through bank transfer and cash payments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/25-held-as-cops-bust-illegal-call-centre-duping-foreigners/articleshow/81878545.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Truck driver held for smuggling gutka worth Rs 37L||AURANGABAD: A truck driver, who had gone to Nanded police station to lodge a robbery complaint, was arrested by police on charges of smuggling gutka. According to police, the suspect driver, Rauf Inamdar, was robbed of Rs 6,000 at knife-point on Thursday near Bondhar bypass. Inamdar sustained injuries in the incident following which he went to the police station to lodge a complaint. However, the truck being driven by Inamdar contained gutka worth Rs 37 lakh. After registering the complaint against unidentified robbers, the local crime branch (LCB) of Nanded police swung into action and in order to get more details about the incident they started questioning Inamdar. During questioning, the LCB team also inquired about the content of the truck for which Inamdar failed to give any satisfactory answer. The LCB officials got suspicious and checked the truck only to find the banned gutka packets in several bags. Soon an alert was sent to the food and drug administration (FDA) office following which an offence was registered against Inamdar and the truck along with gutka was seized. Preliminary probe has revealed that the banned substance being transported from Karnataka. A police office said in majority of gutka-related cases, the product is being transported to Maharashtra from Karnataka. LCB inspector Dwarkadas Chikhlikar said the incident appears to be the tip of an iceberg. “Earlier too we have intercepted such illegal transportation of gutka running into several lakhs,” he said while recalling a case wherein a container full of gutka coming from Haryana was seized by police. The truck driver has been arrested under sections 328, 272 and 273 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) along with other sections of Drug and Cosmetics Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/truck-driver-held-for-smuggling-gutka-worth-rs-37l/articleshow/81875642.cms||Mohammed Akhef

A clear picture will emerge on Saturday as to how many of them would eventually contest as April 3 is the last date for withdrawal of nominations.Of those in fray, 46 are independent candidates, 11 are from smaller parties and three nominees from TRS, Congress and BJP. Sources said the focus of major political parties has already shifted on seeking support of smaller parties, Independents and those who are not contesting. While Congress is cajoling some of the independents and candidates from smaller parties to withdraw from the electoral fray to minimise split of anti-TRS vote, the ruling party is using carrot and stick policy to turn the byelection in its favour. Another important facet of the bypoll is that attempts are being made to seek support of parties and Independents who are not contesting but can get votes polled in favour of the party of their choice. For example, Telangana Jana Samithi, CPI and CPM are not contesting. TJS president M Kodandaram told TOI that they will not support any party or candidate but made it clear that they would appeal to the voters to defeat the ruling TRS.Owaisi-led AIMIM is likely to remain silent as it did in recent MLC elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/major-parties-woo-smaller-players-independents/articleshow/81877887.cms||Roushan Ali

In the first incident, a man allegedly killed his brother-in-law, disfigured his body, burnt it and left it at a vacant flat in Narela area. In the second incident, a 25-year-old woman was allegedly bludgeoned to death by her live-in partner in front of her minor sons in Mangolpuri. The accused in both the cases are currently absconding. In the first case reported on Thursday, a call was received around 10 am at Narela Industrial Area police station that a burnt body of a man has been found lying in a vacant flat. “With the help of local inquiry, the deceased was identified as Karan Kumar, a resident of Kanjhawala.

During the review meeting attended by chief secretaries of the states, DGPs, and senior health professionals, along with the member (health) NITI Aayog, Union home secretary and health secretary, it was felt that these states/UTs had seen continuous deterioration of the Covid scenario over the fortnight. Chandigarh was asked to increase testing to reduce the positivity rate to 5% or less. It was asked to enhance RTPCR testing to 70% of all tests. It was also asked to ensure patients isolated at home be monitored daily and transferred immediately to health facilities, if required. “Statistically, the city has seen a spread in its urban areas. We have no rural areas. Our population follows comparatively more appropriate behaviour but has maximum vaccine hesitancy,” said Arun Kumar Gupta. health secretary, UT. The union home secretary pointed out the 11 states and UTs have not shown commensurate increase in enforcement of containment activities. It was urged that the chief secretaries and DGs (police) of states/UTs take appropriate action.

---||Goa||Government depts haven’t given us blueprints of utilities, we’re helpless: Road contractor||PANAJI: After underground power cables snapped at Peddem on Thursday during the ongoing highway expansion work in North Goa, power supply to parts of Bardez taluka was left unstable even on Friday. While the public works department (PWD) and the electricity department said that the contractor of the highway expansion work, M Venkata Rao Infra Projects Pvt Ltd, was responsible for the damage, the contractor on Friday told TOI that no maps or blueprints of existing utilities were handed over to them by either of the two departments. Managing director M R K Prasad Rao on Friday said the company was helpless in these circumstances. He said the state departments have been unresponsive when any support is sought by the contractor. “The damage was not caused intentionally, it was caused accidentally. We also feel bad for the inconvenience caused to the peopleIn fact, every time there is damage, we have to pay from our own pocket to carry out the repairs, which we have always taken up immediately. It is not as though we have run away from the site,” Rao told TOI. Rao said there was no disobedience on their part as contractors. “We are carrying out the work for the past three years and we are taking utmost care. Let them show one letter to us which states the location of the water pipeline or power cables. In the absence of the blueprints or maps of either the water pipelines or the electricity cables, we are helpless. It is not that there are orders in place and we have disobeyed,” Rao said. He said no engineer is being sent from the state’s end at the site of the work to point out the location of power cables and water pipelines. Rao said the state departments too need to bear some of the responsibility for any damage caused in such circumstances. “The site should not have been handed over at all to us in that case, ...we would have waited another two years for the blueprints of the pipelines and cables. It cannot be a blame game, everyone has to take collective responsibility,” he said. On at least three other occasions over the last five months, the water supply pipeline suffered damage between Guirim and Karaswada during the highway expansion work by the contractor, which affected water supply to Bardez. “I will have to find out,” said PWD minister Deepak Pauskar, when asked if the contractor’s requests for blueprints of utilities had gone unanswered. Pauskar, however, said that M Venkat Rao Infra had begun laying a new pipeline at Curti at its own cost, after damage was caused to the water supply line during the highway expansion works last year. This damage had left Tiswadi with irregular water supply for nearly ten days last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-depts-havent-given-us-blueprints-of-utilities-were-helpless-road-contractor/articleshow/81878552.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Chandigarh||Ludh engineers’ body demands sampling of concrete laid over roads to test quality||Ludhiana: Council of Engineers on Thursday filed a complaint with the chief minister, minister of local bodies, chief secretary, principal secretary of local government and municipal commissioner regarding recarpeting of ongoing roads at inner roads of Block E and BRS Nagar in Ludhiana. The association has demanded sampling of bituminous concrete laid over roads as well as tests to be performed at GNE College in its presence. Engineer Kapil Arora said the first layer of bituminous concrete was laid in front of his residence and to clear the doubts regarding quality and quantity of material used, he discussed the matter with MC commissioner and filed one complaint on Thursday with request for sampling and testing of bituminous content and density test of layer laid by the contractor. He added that however, on Friday, the team of contractors came to lay the top layer to finalise the carpeting work. Arora claimed that an officer told him that he may take samples on his own but since such sample testing is not acceptable, he asked him to send a quality control team to take samples from place as desired by the association. He added the work was stopped by the contractor after receiving a call from junior engineer of MC. Arora further said the junior engineer came along with a third party quality control team to which the complainant asked to take some samples using a core cutting machine. He claimed that the third party as well as MC do not have core cutting machine thus such a sample was not possible on Friday and it can only be done on Monday through GNE College. “The JE said till then work can be put on hold to which the complainant agreed. There is a big question on the credibility of third party quality control team engaged by MC because the team is not even having important lab instrument like core cutting machine. How can MC check the proper quality of ongoing works at site as and when required especially on public holidays?” the complainant said. He added that after some time, junior engineer said the third party (quality control) has taken samples for lab testing but such sampling that is done without information and knowledge of the association smells fishy. “We couldn’t find any place of impugned road under construction from where the company has removed the entire thickness of bituminous concrete layer of prescribed size for lab tests,” he said. Engineer Mohit Jain, senior vice-president of the association, said after sometime, the carpeting of the second layer of bituminous concrete was started with the consent of MC officials, but without any sampling for lab test as per our demand and satisfaction. He added that the level of road has been changed by laying uneven thickness due to which there might be an issue of waterlogging on rainy days, which may lead to earlier damage of roads too. Kulwant Singh Rai, vice-president of the association, said since it is their lawful right to check the quality of public works being executed by urban local body, the Council of Engineers has filed a complaint with higher authorities with request to issue direction to department/ officials concerned to takesSamples of road from various location along with tests to be conducted in civil engineering lab of Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College in the presence of the association members. Junior engineer Baljinder Singh said sample of the road was collected by third party. he added that the person was asking for core cutting of the road which can be done with machine after proper density of work is achieved after it's completion and not when only half work is done. He added that work is almost complete there. The junior engineer said residents of the area are keen on completing the work at the earliest. He added that even report of the samples of roa, that the third party had taken and were sent to GNE college, have not shown anything wrong with quality of work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ludh-engineers-body-demands-sampling-of-concrete-laid-over-roads-to-test-quality/articleshow/81876215.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||AAP and BJP spar over Delhi excise policy, ‘liquor mafia’ in city||New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party MLA Atishi on Friday said that Delhi government’s move to eradicate the liquor mafia through changes in the excise policy had rattled BJP, which is why it was opposing the move. Meanwhile, International Spirits and Wine Association of India (ISWAI) has written to LG Anil Baijal supporting the proposed changes in the excise policy. ISWAI praised the lowering of the drinking age from 25 to 21 years and lauded the AAP government’s decision to move out of the liquor business and ensure equitable distribution of shops. Atishi said BJP was against the decision to reduce the legal drinking age in Delhi claiming it to be immoral. “However, Goa, Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh, which are led by BJP, have the legal drinking age of 18 years. Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Tripura have the age limit set at 21,” she added. “BJP is opposing the policy because restaurants and wine and beer shops, where underage drinking takes place, give hefty protection money to them. With this new reform, this nexus will end. They do not want this,” Atishi claimed. The AAP functionary added that uneven distribution of shops was leading to liquor being sold illegally. In response, Leader of Opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri asked why AAP didn’t stop the liquor mafia during its six years of governing Delhi. “It’s clear that the AAP government is hand in glove with the liquor mafia,” he added, while referring to deputy CM Manish Sisodia’s remark that 2,000 illegal liquor shops were causing a loss of Rs 2,000 crore to the exchequer. “How many liquor mafia members were prosecuted and jailed? How many cases under the excise Act were registered and how many FIRs were filed against those operating illegal liquor shops?” asked Bidhuri, while announcing that he would launch a protest if the policy was implemented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-and-bjp-spar-over-delhi-excise-policy-liquor-mafia-in-city/articleshow/81878559.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||TBS, officials booked in Andhra Pradesh medical scam||HYDERABAD: The Crime Investigation Department (CID) of AP has booked a case against Bengaluru-based TBS India Telematic & Biomedical Services Private Limited, private persons and health department officials in connection with Rs 450 crore medical equipment maintenance scam. The case was registered under IPC sections of cheating, criminal conspiracy and criminal breach of trust. The irregularities include price escalations, inflated bills of non-existing equipment and raising invoices for equipment in government hospitals in AP. The case was booked based on a complaint filed by civic activist Indukuri Venkata Rama Raju of Avidi village in East Godavari district. In the FIR, the CID alleged: “As per the agreement, the government had to pay 7.45 per cent of the total vale of biomedical equipment towards maintenance for one year, which was initially valued at Rs 450 crore. It was clandestinely agreed between the service provider and the health officials to extend the agreement beyond one year, which was illegal.” The CID further alleged: “The service provider with the active connivance of officials was drawing more maintenance charges by drastically escalating the prices of the equipment, claiming maintenance charges on fudged values, indulging in billing process fraud and executing the agreement without termination clause to suit its convenience.” “This gave an undue advantage to the service provider. Though the value of the assets is less than Rs 400 crore, it was claiming bills on the assets value of Rs 500 crore. The service provider did not make the equipment functional in six months and took another year,” alleged the investigation agency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tbs-officials-booked-in-ap-medical-scam/articleshow/81877906.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Hyderabad||Telangana HC stays jail term for collector, officials||HYDERABAD: Finding some substance in the arguments of the state regarding submergence and double benefits, the Telangana high court on Thursday stayed the 3-months jail term slapped on Siricilla district collector D Krishna Bhaskar, joint collector Yasmin Basha, and RDO N Srinivas by a single judge earlier in a contempt case. The bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy, however, directed them to deposit with the registry of the high court the penalty of Rs 2,000 and costs of Rs 10,000 to be paid to each of the 29 farmers, imposed by the single judge. The aggrieved farmers, U Mutha Reddy, and others, who are fighting the legal battle are from Anantagiri and Repaka villages in the Siricilla district where the Anantagiri reservoir is coming up.  Appearing for the accused officials, advocate general BS Prasad said that the state had immediately a petition seeking vacation of the stay imposed by the single judge because in some cases his interim order asked the state to pay rehabilitation benefits twice to the same farmers. The state issued two separate land acquisition notifications. Some farmers have lost land under one notification and houses under another notification. The state is of the opinion that while compensation can be paid to both, rehabilitation benefits need not be extended twice if the farmer happens to be the owner of both, the AG said. “Even before this point could be adjudicated, the farmers preferred a contempt case and the single judge convicted the officers,” the AG said. “We have not dispossessed any of the farmers. The compensation and benefits were paid to the farmers pertaining to 2450 acres. Since the water was released into the reservoir, a 50-acre land belonging to the petitioner farmers, stood submerged. The single judge read it as state-led dispossession, which is not the case here,” the AG said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-stays-jail-term-for-collector-officials/articleshow/81877907.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Rajkot||Over 350 lose Rs 50cr in saving schemes fraud||Rajkot: The complaint of Rs 5 crore fraud involving about 112 investors in Rajkot has turned out to be just the tip of the iceberg. Close to 350 people, mostly from low-income groups, have been defrauded of at least Rs 50 crore that was siphoned off by three persons who floated fake firms and a credit cooperative society. On Friday, the city police arrested the accused — Pradeep Davera, Divyesh Kalawadia and Hitesh Lukka — who were named in the complaint lodged with the police by Rajesh Vaghela, one of the investors, who lost Rs4 lakh of his savings.  The trio lured gullible investors with the promise of high interest rates and handsome returns on their investments. Davera is the chairman of the Ashish Credit Cooperative Society and two other firms — Samay Trading and Sai Samay Trading. Police said that they targeted sweepers and other lower-income groups. The probe till now suggests over 350 investors’ money is stuck in this scam. “Davera was living in Valsad and was engaged in stock broking. He shifted to Rajkot in 2017 and floated Samay Trading firm and schemes to lure investors by offering 10% return every month on an investment of Rs1 lakh. “Two years later, Davera along with Kalawadia and Lukka floated Ashish Credit Cooperative Society to attract investors for their various nefarious schemes including daily, monthly and yearly savings and also lured small-time investors with the promise of high returns. Most of the victims did not have any idea about the stock market. They were only attracted by the high returns on their investment,” said a police official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/over-350-lose-rs-50cr-in-saving-schemes-fraud/articleshow/81877631.cms||---

Also, the decision to cancel the trains has been taken in view of the ongoing maintenance work on the railway section,” said Amit Gupta, divisional railway manager of Vadodara railway division.

---||Chandigarh||BJP MP Malik attacks Congress govt, terms leaders corrupt, shown black flags by farmers||Ludhiana: Member of Parliament and former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state president Shwait Malik on Friday visited Ludhiana amid tight police security. Malik and other senior BJP leaders from the district and state unit addressed journalists at circuit house. Earlier in the day Malik's motorcade was shown black flags at Ladhowal Toll Plaza by representatives of farmer unions Malik said, “In the 2017 assembly elections, the Congress government made a lot of promises to the public, including waiving of the loan worth Rs 90,000 crore of farmers, which was not fulfilled. The outstanding payment for the crops was promised but not delivered. Updating of APMC Act was also promised by the Congress in 2017, which was finally fulfilled under the BJP government but the Congress government had spread misinformation and instigated the farmers. Congress failed to provide compensation and jobs to the people of Punjab. Captain Amarinder Singh himself had made many promises to the youth, like government jobs for someone from every family. He had also promised to provide smartphones and laptops but none of these was fulfilled.” According to Malik, industrialists too were short changed. “New Industry policy that was promised will be implemented within 90 days by Congress government is still not in place, resulting in the massive migration of industries from Punjab. Factories were promised power at R. 5 per, unit but it is costing about Rs 12 per unit. The prevalent lawlessness and anarchy under Captain’s governance is a major reason for the repulsed and impassive attitude of both Indian and foreign industrialists towards establishment of new industries in Punjab,” he alleged. He also claimed that despite CM’s vow to free Punjab from the grasp of drugs within four weeks, the drugs are still being sold by the leaders of his own party, which has resulted in over 100 deaths. Malik also said BJP was able to get 1,500 of its candidates to compete in the civic body elections. “Out of which over 1,000 candidates, despite the unfavourable circumstances, bagged many seats but Congress misused the government machinery and power to manipulate the situation, killing democracy as is apparent to all who witnessed their victory,” alleged Malik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bjp-mp-malik-attacks-congress-govt-terms-leaders-corrupt-shown-black-flags-by-farmers/articleshow/81876219.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Waze seen at CSMT heading to Thane on day of Hiran murder||MUMBAI: A day before Thane resident Mansukh Hiran’s body was found in Mumbra creek on March 5, suspended API Sachin Waze was captured on the CCTV camera at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) waiting for the train, according to sources. “On March 4, around 6.30pm, Waze left the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) office at the police headquarters. He left his mobile phone behind. He was captured on the CCTV camera at CSMT,” said a source. “Waze reached Thane around 8.10pm and called Mansukh at 8.20pm from a SIM card procured through an accomplice from Gujarat. He asked Hiran to meet him at Ghodbunder Road, but told him to tell his wife that he was going to meet an inspector Tawde as Hiran’s family was upset with Waze. Waze picked him up in his Audi car in which there were already three people, including Shinde,” the source added. Waze had allegedly handed over Hiran to his killers in Thane, according to sources. Then, at 9.20pm, Waze took a train to Byculla. He proceeded to Dongri and asked his subordinate Riyazuddin Kazi to get his phone from his office, sources said. At 10.30pm, Waze went to Dongri police station and said that he was carrying out searches in some hotels. “This was an alibi to hoodwink the investigators,” an official said. NIA officials suspect that Hiran was smothered to death in the moving car and his body was dumped in a Mumbra creek. Police said that Waze later went to his CIU office at the police headquarters. A hotelier who had come to hand over a hafta collection of Rs 1.7 crore to Waze claimed that he had overheard policemen trying to convince Hiran to take responsibility for parking the explosives-laden car near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s south Mumbai residence. Waze had allegedly promised to bail him out immediately. The hotelier, who has now become a witness to the meeting, told NIA officials that he overheard Hiran coming in and out of Waze’s cabin and mumbling to himself as to why he should take the responsibility when he had not done anything wrong. TOI has learnt that NIA investigations also indicate that the initial plan hatched in November 2020 was to plant the explosives in a stolen vehicle, identify two members of an outlawed organisation and kill them in a fake encounter near Ambani’s residence. Sources said that the Maruti Eeco was stolen from Aurangabad with this plan in mind. The car belonged to Vijay Nade, a clerk with the social justice department in Jalna, who had lodged a complaint of theft with the City Chowk police station there. The vehicle is not yet traced, but the number plate was recovered from Mithi River along with Waze’s CPU, laptop, hard drives and DVRs on Sunday. The NIA, with the help of anti-terrorism squad, is looking for the Maruti Eeco. Nade is not part of the conspiracy, officials said. However, Waze’s plan went awry as he got stuck with the Television Rating Point manipulation scam probe and in the modified scheme of things, it was decided to only plant gelatin sticks in the vehicle. The motive is still not clear. Meanwhile, the NIA continued questioning the woman who was seen with Waze in a five-star hotel and travelled with him in the Audi. NIA officials declined to comment on her role in the crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-waze-seen-at-csmt-heading-to-thane-on-day-of-hiran-murder/articleshow/81878565.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Goa||State nod for acquisition of narcotic detection kits||PANAJI: The state government has granted its approval for the purchase of 11 narcotic detection kits for testing of banned substances on the spot during raids. SP Mahesh Gaonkar of the anti-narcotics cell (ANC) said with these kits, police can detect the kind of drug seized right on the spot. A senior officer said that the state government has given its approval for the procurement of 28 standard reference samples for the Goa state forensic science laboratory (GSFSL). “The import licence of 16 narcotic standard reference samples from the central bureau of narcotics, Gwalior, has been obtained,” he said. The samples will arrive in Germany. After failing to get bidders on three occasions, GSFSL approached the state government to allow them to place the order directly. A senior officer said that once the testing of synthetic drugs starts, it would help police conclude investigations and file chargesheets. Police also said that drug cases are pending because it takes a year to get the CSFL report on drugs from other states. Currently, chemical drugs are sent out of the state for analysis, with most seized substances sent to the central forensic science laboratory (CFSL), Hyderabad. However, ganja and charas are tested at the food and drugs administration (FDA) laboratory in Goa. The current procedure of sending drugs out of Goa is time-consuming and hinders both investigations and chargesheets/closure reports, police said. Synthetic drugs are imported by foreigners, and are mostly used during parties. “Such drugs are sold in Goa during peak tourist season, when foreigners are in the state,” said an officer. He also said that after analysing data, ANC has found that 30 foreigners who were arrested in drug-related cases entered Goa via the Dabolim airport. Police have seized ganja, MDMA, cocaine, charas, LSD liquid, LSD paper, heroin, amphetamine, ketamine and DMT in various cases. In 2018, CFSL’s Delhi and Hyderabad units stopped accepting drug samples due to unavailability of reference material for identification of the seized narcotics. Thus, many cases pertaining to drugs like LSD, MDMA, etc, have hit a roadblock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-nod-for-acquisition-of-narcotic-detection-kits/articleshow/81878558.cms||---

Though the state government issued a clarification regarding the tweet, the opposition said that it appeared as propaganda for the Portuguese Colonialists. Opposition leader Digambar Kamat said that Sawant should apologise for insulting the sentiments of patriotic Indians. “The contribution of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj and the Great Maratha warriors for Goa should never be forgotten. It is most unfortunate that BJP government has insulted the Maratha warriors,” Kamat said.

Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and her aide-turned-rival BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari are both confident of winning the polls. While some pointed to a paradigm shift in the voting pattern, given the sharp polarisation on religious lines in Nandigram, poll pundits kept their fingers crossed over the degree of it. Even vote managers on both the camps did not seem quite sure which way the battle might turn as the polling percentage in other constituencies in East Midnapore remained either the same as the 2016 assembly elections or a little less. While Mahishadal recorded 88.5 polling percentage this time, the figure was 89.1% in 2016. Chandipur, which had 89.2% polling percentage on Thursday, had recorded 88.9% in 2016.  The average polling in East Midnapore recorded 87.2% in nine seats. One reason, experts said, could be that Nandigram was a high-voltage seat this time, with chief minister Banerjee contesting Adhikari from there.  As the campaign gained momentum, Adhikari reportedly worked on the “polarisation model”, something not witnessed in Bengal before.  He called Banerjee “Begum, fufa, khala” and mocked at her “faulty recitation” of Chandi chants and Saraswati Vandana, aiming to consolidate Hindu votes . Adhikari also tried to win over the Vaishnavs, who have a significant presence in East Midnapore. The CM on the other hand launched a narrative of “gaddar, Mir Jafar” against her political rival. But neither Banerjee nor adhikari could physically reach many villages in Nandigram I, which Adhikari called “mini Pakistan”. While Adhikari sounded confident about his vote management plan on the election day, the CM reposed faith in the people. Cross-currents in the high-voltage game couldn’t be ruled out. Bankura recorded 86.9% polling in eight seats, and South 24-Parganas 86.6% in four seats. West Midnapore recorded 83.8% polling in nine seats. While Ghatal showed a dip in polling from 84.1% in 2016 to 79.8% now, Daspur witnessed a 74% turnout against 78.4% in 2016. Polling in Narayangarh was a little higher at 90.9% against 88.8% in 2016. Sabang had the same polling percentage of 88 in 2016 and 2021. Keshpur, which witnessed major violence, recorded 87.9 % polling, similar to that in 2016. Debra, where former IPS officers — Bharati Ghosh and Humayun Kabir — had locked horns, recorded 86.5% turnout against 89.1% in 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/1-rise-in-nandi-voting-no-major-change-in-rest-of-dist/articleshow/81877936.cms||Debasish Konar

Tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar told reporters that he would order an inquiry into the incident. In its clarification, Goa tourism said, “The word “invader” was meant to be used for the Dutch.

Also, the active cases which were fluctuating between 1,200 and 1,600 in the month of January have now crossed the 10,000-mark. Health authorities have started micro containment and contact tracing and have also increased daily tests to contain the spread. With two deaths, the total number of casualties reached 2,824 since the outbreak. “As on March 26, the state had 5,733 active cases which went up to 10,484 on Friday. This is really alarming and people need to follow the Covid protocol,” said an officer with the health department. On Friday, the health department issued a fresh circular to the private hospitals, having capacity of 60 beds or more, to reserve 10 per cent of their beds for Covid patients as also 10 per cent of their ICU beds. Among all districts, Kota witnessed 195 fresh cases on Friday, highest in the state. It was followed by Jaipur where 188 new infections were reported taking its total figure to 62,121 and the number of active cases to 1,891. “Majorty of patients coming in have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic. Thankfully, severe cases have not been reported so far as people are cautious enough to go for early testing,” said Dr Ajeet Singh, superintendent of Rajasthan University of Health Sciences (RUHS), a Covid-dedicated government hospital. Among areas in the city, Malviya Nagar, Jhotwara, Jagatpura, Sodala and Vaishali Nagar continued to report 10 or more cases. “Malviya Nagar had 18 cases and was followed by Vaishali Nagar with 13 cases, Jhotwara 12, Ajmer Road 11, Sodala 11 and Jagapura 10,” said an officer.

---||---||Elections over, Nandigram back to its own self||NANDIGRAM: After facing the glare of spotlights for over a month, people of Nandigram appeared to breathe easy on Friday and returned to normal life. Three boys aged between seven and nine, played hide-and-seek near Boyal Maqtab Primary School that had been the scene of taut tension on Thursday as a group of Hindus and Muslims braced for a face-off and forced chief minister Mamata Banerjee to remain in the school’s corridor for two hours. Now, away from political pressure and the media glare, the men and women, who had been at each other’s throat till a day before, appeared to set aside their aggressive stance as they went about their daily lives. Even the central forces left by buses around 11.30pm. At Nandigram bazar, those who had walked in rival rallies and voted for opposite sides rubbed shoulders on Saturday. While the campaign had rhetoric that appeared to polarize the people, the fissures weren’t visible. The only trouble that broke out on Friday was a fracas between BJP and TMC supporters at Bhimkanta in Boyal 1. Police and RAF defused the tension. “The Muslims may have voted for one party and some Hindus for another, but there is no real divide in our daily lives. If that were so, our lives would change and we would become poorer. For every Muslim that steps into my shop, I get three Hindus,” said Jamaluddin Mullick (23) of Asadtalia in Nandigram I. A fruit-seller said him being a Hindu never stopped Muslims from buying from him, especially during Ramzan. Neither does a Hindu woman think twice about buying fruits for pujas from a Muslim vendor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/elections-over-nandigram-back-to-its-own-self/articleshow/81877942.cms||Suman Mandal

Partur police said the suspect, Santosh Sarode, was upset about his wife and her mother attending a marriage ceremony without his permission and attacked them with a sickle. The elderly woman, Resham Kole (60), succumbed to the injuries at the Aurangabad-based Government Medical College and Hospital while daughter Kavita Sarode (35) is battling for life at the same hospital, said police. Police said Santosh reached home late on Thursday night and found his wife had gone to attend the marriage of their neighbour along with her mother. Soon after they returned home, the suspect told them why they went without his consent. This resulted into a heated argument, following which he allegedly attacked them with a sickle, said police. The mother-daughter duo were rushed to a local hospital by their neighbours. However, considering their serious condition, they were referred to the Aurangabad GMCH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/man-held-for-killing-mom-in-law-in-jalna-village/articleshow/81875697.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The step has been taken to make necessary arrangements for these students, who come from across the country, in situations like Covid-19 pandemic, according to an official statement issued here on Friday. CM Ashok Gehlot has approved the proposal for this project, which will be completed at an estimated cost of Rs 68 lakh. According to the plan received by the department of information technology and communications, a student database will be prepared to create a web portal and a mobile app with information like students’ address, their family, hostels and PGs, and coaching centres details. Through the portal, students’ issues regarding coaching, housing and meals will be resolved. The RajComp Info Services Limited (RISL) will prepare the register which will have a database of around two lakh students. Similar student registers will also be prepared for other cities with coaching institutes, the statement added. There are around 50 small and 10 big coaching institutes in Kota where students prepare for competitive examinations of engineering, medical and other fields. The city has 25,000 paying guest facilities, 3,000 hostels and 1,800 kitchen messes.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC’s plan to build underground water tanks is a ‘scam’, alleges BJP||MUMBAI: BJP has made allegations of a “scam” in BMC’s plan to construct underground water storage tanks at Pramod Mahajan Udyan at Dadar and at St Xavier’s ground in Parel since BMC has warded work to contractors without tenders as part of a variation in existing storm water drain (SWD) works. In a letter to municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, BJP’s corporator Vinod Mishra has said BMC awarded work worth around Rs 130 crore without tenders. “I’ve been told these two works have been awarded without tenders and part of a variation given to the existing contractor. This is clear violation of norms and such work cannot be given under Section 72 (3) of the MMC Act. This is turned into a major scam in the name of flood mitigation and prevention. These tanks are being constructed on open spaces, so this is not just a scam of financial mismanagement but also a way to destroy prime open spaces used by citizens extensively,” Mishra’s letter says. Last month, BJP MLA Kalidas Kolambkar had alsowritten to Chahal, demanding that work on the underground tank at Pramod Mahajan Udyan be stopped. “There was no need to use an emergency clause to award this work without tenders. BMC should have planned the project better and followed a detailed tender process before awarding this new, highly technical work. The contractor who has been given this work has no prior experience of constructing a water storage tank underground. So, it seems the only reason for awarding this work is to allow siphoning of money under the guise of flood mitigation,” the letter adds. Additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu said BMC did not have enough time to flow tenders. “There is no time for tenders. The work will be carried out at 27% below rate. Work, from the time of issuing of work order, has to be completed within four months. So tender procedure is not possible considering shortage of time,” he said. Velrasu added that water holding ponds are a common measure adopted globally for relief from floods.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmcs-plan-to-build-underground-water-tanks-is-a-scam-alleges-bjp/articleshow/81878592.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Her family has accused relatives, with whom she had earlier gone on a trip, for the crime. They had dumped her body at the hospital, they added, and then pressured the family to not take the case to the police to “avoid scandal”. “On March 22 … around 7.30am, my daughter left for her (school) but did not return till late in the evening. When I went to the school, it was shut and she was nowhere to be found. Around 7pm, her brother’s in-laws came home and expressed their sympathies and asked us not to go to the police for fear of disrepute,” the girl’s father said in the complaint to the police. While they kept looking for the girl, her brother’s in-laws would keep visiting the family and reiterate that word must not get out. “On March 31, around 1pm, we got a call saying her corpse was lying at a hospital in Noida. We got to know then she had been gang-raped and brutally murdered. When we went over the CCTV footage from the area, we saw a relative riding a bike (the one who had called them and asked them not to go to the police), my daughter in the middle, and another youth riding pillion.” Police said the two men, the relative and the unidentified man, had dropped her body at the hospital — they had presumably carried the corpse on the bike — and slipped away. The doctors found her dead on arrival. The autopsy report said she had been “smothered” to death. The family has named six members of the brother’s in-laws’ family in the complaint, on the basis of which an FIR has been filed against them and an unidentified person, the one on the bike. They have all been booked under the Pocso Act and for gang-rape, kidnapping and murder. “Three of them have been arrested.

However, we suspect that the duo got suspicious about ACB laying a trap to nab them and avoided accepting the bribe money,” superintendent of police (ACB) Rahul Khade told TOI. According to the complaint lodged by the victim, he had recently visited the Gangapur-based sub-registrar’s office for getting two properties situated in gat number 28 of Ghanegaon registered. The man has stated that the official allegedly demanded Rs 1 lakh for sanctioning the two registries while the other accused acting as an agent of the authorities allegedly demanded Rs 13,000 for registry of each of the row houses. Unwilling to grease the palms of the authorities, the man lodged a complaint with the ACB. On March 30, the anti-corruption agency did a verification. An amount of Rs 1 lakh was negotiated and the deal was finalized for Rs 70, 000, said the officials. As per the deal, the suspects were expected to call the complainant and ask him to bring the bribe amount. However, they grew suspicious and started avoiding him, added the ACB..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/revisedofficial-aide-booked-for-demanding-bribe/articleshow/81875701.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The declaration from Ajmal junior has sent shockwaves across the state, with the statement made at Bhabanipur in Bajali district, home to Khargeswar Talukdar, the first martyr of the anti-foreigners’ movement. Political observers say it has caused a stir as the description matches the appearance and attire attributed to Bengali-speaking migrant Muslims in the state. “Amradahri-topi-lungiwallah manusher sarkar hoiba. Aamrar ma-bhanidder dupatta izzat kora lagbo, amrar ma-bhanidder burkhar izzat kora lagbo (we beard-cap-lungi wearing people will form the government. The duppata of our mothers and sisters have to be respected. The burqa of our mothers and sisters have to be respected),” Abdur said as his father listened to him, sitting on the dais. At present, campaigning is on only in constituencies going to polls in the third phase where migrant Muslims are in overwhelming numbers and back AIUDF and Congress. Ajmal senior later said, “Upper Assam (where the indigenous reside and went to polls in first phase) was theirs (BJP)…this (third phase) is ours.” BJP’s Himanta Biswa Sarma appealed to the EC to take action over the statements. “People of Assam will condemn such statements,” he said. There are 40 seats in the third phase, out of which Bengali-speaking migrant Muslims are in majority in 17. In 2016, Congress and AIUDF had won all these. BJP, and its then allies AGP and BPF, had together won the remaining 23. In nine districts, Muslim population (almost all migrants) is more than 50% and the third phase seats are spread in five of them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/assam/ajmal-sons-dadhi-topi-lungi-salvo-sends-shockwaves/articleshow/81880575.cms||Prabin Kalita
---||Nagpur||City’s water bodies are drowning in pollution: ESR||Nagpur: Most lakes in the city have high pollution levels, reveals Environment Status Report (ESR) for Nagpur prepared by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri). It warns that if Gorewada and Gandhisagar lakes were not cleaned, they could act as breeding hubs for antibiotic-resistant bacteria that would be the emerging public health concern. The report states the water quality of Gandhisagar, Sonegaon, Ambazari, Sakkardara, Futala and Naik lakes was bad, with a chemical oxygen demand between 25-140 milligrams per litre (mg/l). “The concentration of nutrients in terms of phosphate was also found high in the lakes which may lead to eutrophication (growth of algae and weeds),” the analysis adds. For the study, a total of 13 sampling locations were identified – two from Ambazari lake, three from Gandhisagar lake, two from Sakkardara lake, two from Sonegaon lake, four from Naik lake and 20 from Futala Lake— including surface and depth sampling. “The lakes are in a bad shape and it is necessary to prevent further damage. Flow of sewage needs to be diverted as there is a constant pollution load on water bodies,” said Rita Dhodapkar, science secretary and principal technical officer at Neeri. On Nag river, she added, “Analysis of data shows that since three years, the pollution levels have not come down.” Stating that discharge of untreated sewage in lakes from nearby habitation was a common feature in the city, founder of NGO Green Vigil Foundation Kaustav Chatterjee said, “As far as analysis of Nag river is concerned, we all know that it is carrying only sewage and there is no fresh water source except in rainy season. Normally, sewage has a COD of 450 mg/l and Biochemical Oxygen Demand ( BOD) of 200 mg/l. However as per the report, COD of Nag river at some places has been reported as high as 1880 mg/l and 1440 mg/l and BOD as 315 mg/l and 45 mg/l.” As the COD and BOD values do not match with that of sewage nor is their ratio normal, there could be a possibility of discharge of industrial waste water and other manmade pollutants too in Nag river resulting in high COD values, added Chatterjee. In the ESR, anthropogenic activities like bathing , washing clothes and dumping of plastic, papers, oil, glasses, materials used in worship etc have been reported in all lakes except Ambazari Lake. “However, except turbidity, most of the physico-chemical parameters and metals are below BIS limits. Most of our lakes have uncontrolled spread of eichhornia, one of the main reasons for which is availability of nitrates and phosphates in water. But surprisingly, the nitrates and phosphates have been reported to be within permissible limit,” said Chatterjee. Alarm Bells - Lakes in city have high pollution levels - If Gorewada and Gandhisagar lakes not cleaned, they could pose serious threat to public health - Concentration of nutrients in terms of phosphate was found high, may lead to eutrophication - Pollution levels of Nag river have not come down in last three years - Flow of sewage needs to be diverted||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/citys-water-bodies-are-drowning-in-pollution-esr/articleshow/81877948.cms||Manka Behl

The cops used CCTV feed from the petrol pump to nab all three. The accused have been identifies as Mehraj Alam Hossain, Md Alam Hossain and Md Sohel. “Two staffers of a pub in Camac Street were walking towards Sealdah station when these bike-borne men tried to snatch mobile phones and cash from them. When the victims — residents of Kanchrapara and Budge Budge — tried to resist, the accused allegedly attacked the duo with sharp weapons. The bikers finally looted two mobile phones and some cash and managed to escape. The injured youths were rushed to SSKM Hospital, where they came across a third victim — a petrol pump employee from Taratala who claimed that he was thrashed after he asked money from three bikers after they had filled petrol from the pump,” said an officer. “We came to know that right before they rode to Camac Street, they had robbed a mobile phone in the Esplanade area. We are ascertaining the details,” said an investigating officer. The accused have been sent to police custody till April 9. The detective department has recently questioned several men whom they have arrested recently in snatching cases and have already shared necessary information with both Rabindranagar and Maheshtala police stations under Diamond Harbour police division. "We plan to identify the history sheeters and nab them," said an officer. In addition to the joint raids, the cops said they would continue with their robust area patrolling. "Most of the major markets in the area now have cop presence. The department is also carrying out anti-crime drives across the city to arrest known kepmars and snatchers. Our constant presence will ensure we take immediate steps when something gets reported,” said an officer at Lalbazar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-nab-gang-on-crime-spree/articleshow/81877040.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

It gutted around one hectare of forest. Forest authorities claimed that it was a ground fire which destroyed grassland and shrubs but not the trees. However, small wild animals could have been affected. A resident of Ghadiyapur village, who saw the blaze, said, “The fire engulfed a huge part of the forest. Villagers feared that wild animals fleeing for cover could enter human habitat, posing a threat to people.” Manok Shukla, Najibabad divisional forest officer, said, “It was a ground fire that destroyed shrubs. There was loss to wild animals. It took hours to douse the blaze. The fire was tracked by satellite.” On what caused the fire, Shukla said, “A kucha road between Rajgarh and Sahanpur ranges leads to Ghadiyapur village. The forest might have caught fire after a passerby carelessly threw a smoldering cigarette or bidi there. A probe is on and staff concerned has been put on alert.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/massive-fire-guts-1-hectare-of-forest-in-bijnor/articleshow/81877038.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Kolkata||Three giant trees axed for clear view of new Nonapukur hotel||Kolkata: The hacking down of three giant trees in front of a newly constructed commercial building, apparently because it blocks the view of its facade and obstructs the entrance, has left the green brigade incensed. Even as KMC and the forest utilization department passed the buck, environmentalists and activists have questioned their right to allow private developers and businesses to murder public greenery. The nearly 50-year-old banyan and peepal trees on the same pavement as Nonapukur tram depot were swiftly cut under the cover of darkness in the early hours of Thursday and Friday. Though Bonani Kakkar of PUBLIC made an urgent appeal to KMC to stop the destruction, the decimation of trees was complete by Friday morning. “Trees on a main road have more critical functions than trees on a side street. Their survival rate, too, is lower,” said green activist Bonani Kakkar. Civic officials, when asked about cutting down trees on the pavement, said the request for hacking the trees came from former member mayor-in-council (market department) Amiruddin (Bobby). At the time, he was still a member in the KMC board of administrators. The forest utilization department had thereafter given permission. A senior official of the KMC parks department first declined to issue such a certificate after a spot visit. However, the permission was issued in December, said a KMC parks department official. Based on the NOC, the forest department granted permission to fell the trees. Speaking to TOI, Amiruddin said he had acted as per law. “I had the requisite permission from the forest department and KMC to cut the trees. I will take up compensatory plantation according to rules,” he said. Expressing frustration over the shocking frequency with which this pattern of trees being cut away by builders repeats itself in Kolkata, Kakkar said the complete absence of conscience as well as policing and resistance, even from local residents, was unfortunate. “Why doesn’t KMC inspect the site and check the plan to then suggest changes so that the trees don’t have to be cut?” she wondered. Pointing to similar destruction on Sarat Bose Road and EM Bypass to remove ‘obstruction’ to hoardings and commercial establishments, Sabuj Mancha convenor Naba Datta questioned KMC’s motive in granting permission to felling of trees in such instances. “The KMC has revived many parks in the past decade. But it has woefully failed in protecting the grand trees that are a city’s heritage. Less than a year ago, 15,000 trees were lost to Amphan. Yet, the civic body allows builders to murder trees that are public property with impunity,” fumed Dutta. Green activist Subhas Datta said the action of both KMC and the forest department was against the interest of the city and was misuse of the powers that had been vested in them to protect the environment. “Both agencies have misused their authority and bowed to a person of influence,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/three-giant-trees-axed-for-clear-view-of-new-nonapukur-hotel/articleshow/81877037.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Though the parking plaza was officially inaugurated in February this year, it took some time to appoint the parking fee collecting operators and to finish other minor works to throw it open to public. “Safety arrangements have been made with reflective mirrors on the corners and digital markers,” said an official of the Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority (NDITA), which has set up the G+8 parking plaza on plot AQ 11 in Sector V. Car-owners will have to shell out Rs 10 per hour to park their car. Vehicles can also be parked on a monthly basis for Rs 1,500. NDITA officials said the plaza will minimize the problem of cars being parked on roadsides in Sector V and will ensure free traffic movement in the IT hub. “The multi-level parking complex has been built to decongest and ease traffic chaos in Sector V. Parking of vehicles on the roadside has been a long-standing problem,” said an official. The parking plaza also has solar panel and rainwater harvesting facilities and space for rehabilitating hawkers. There will also be a food court and other commercial shops on the ground floor of the complex. Apart from the parking plaza, NDITA has also identified 14 streets — divided into four zones — as fee car parking zones and are in the process to engage agencies for operating them and collect parking fees. Parking and no-parking signboards will also be put up across the IT hub.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-plaza-to-solve-sector-v-parking-crisis/articleshow/81877047.cms||Suman Chakraborti

---||Nagpur||Adequate stock in reservoirs, no water crunch likely this summer||Nagpur: In some good news, the Nagpur city and district can expect to sail through summer 2021 without facing drinking water shortage. This is due to the extended monsoon in 2020, especially in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh. The reservoirs here have adequate storage to see the district through till October 2021, a senior official of the water resources department (WRD) told TOI. The region’s 78 reservoirs, including 13 medium, 60 small and five major ones, have 58.31% storage or 2,858.66 million metre cube (mmc) water, as per the WRD data. The only two sources of water for the city – Kamptee Khairi (180.98mmc) and Totladoh (919.19mmc) – too have ample storage, the data revealed. As per the data for the last five years, water storage was the second highest this year as on April 2. The highest storage was in 2020 when Kamptee Khairi had 109.56mmc and Totladoh 1,025.42mmc water. Totladoh reservoir is the city’s key water source and gets around 858.37mmc water. Navegaon Khairi has a storage of 70.56mmc water against its capacity of 141.98mmc. A senior official from the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) water works department told TOI that Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority (MWRRA) had already allocated the entitlement and reserved 173.5MMC of raw drinking water, as calculated by the WRD in November 2020. The allocation is valid till October 31, 2021. Water works committee chairman Sandip Gavai told TOI that currently the NMC was supplying 650-670 millions of litres per day (mld) water to the city, which includes 205-215mld water from Kanhan, and 450-460mld from Totladoh reservoir (Pench). “The water is sufficient for the 2021 summer season,” he said. Sources, however, pointed out that water in the Kanhan river stream is almost dried up. Gavai attributed the encouraging scenario to the ample rain received in the region during the last year’s extended monsoon, especially in neighbouring Chhindwara district of MP. During the tenure of former water works committee chairman Vijay Zalke, he had taken the initiative to plug at least five leakages in the 2,300mm pipeline supplying 460mld water from Pench reservoir (Totladoh). This has saved at least 5 MLD water going waste every day for the last couple of years. To a query, Gavai said as the city is witnessing a spike in Covid cases, state or central government may impose curfew-like restrictions. This will lead to more people staying indoors which in turn means increased water usage like during the 2020 lockdown period. He appealed to the people to use water judiciously. Gavai said around 125 tankers are being pressed to supply water in non-network areas and claimed to have directed the civic administration to speed up the works of laying pipelines in non-network areas in the city limits.

---||Mumbai||Obscene video case: Tech startup ex-staff among two arrested in Mumbai||MUMBAI: A former employee of a social influencer tech startup has been arrested, along with a videographer, for allegedly shooting an obscene video in an Andheri hotel and uploading it online in 2019. The names of Meeta Jhunjhunwala (46) and Raju Dubey (34) came up in actor-model Sherlyn Chopra’s statement to Maharashtra Cyber in March. Jhunjhunwala was a creative director, while Dubey was the videographer of the video, ‘Chocolate’, featuring Chopra. UK businessman Raj Kundra was called to the Maharashtra Cyber office after Chopra mentioned him in her statement. Kundra told TOI he had submitted all documentation regarding his investment in the startup as well as his exit to Maharashtra Cyber. In November 2020, Maharashtra Cyber had registered an FIR against 14 OTT platforms and web portals for obscene content based on a complaint by a retired customs official. Summons were sent to the heads of these platforms and portals, besides some actors in the videos. Chopra recorded her statement between March 15 and 18 after the Bombay high court granted her interim bail. “On several occasions, I got into heated arguments with Meeta regarding co-ncepts for content creation and execution...Sometimes it was very difficult to keep aside my creative differences with her,” Chopra said in her statement. On December 23, 2019, Jhunjhunwala organised a shoot at the hotel, according to Chopra’s statement. “Dubey was hired through my reference. I was asked to enter the hotel discreetly...The ‘Chocolate’ concept was filmed by Dubey under Meeta’s guidance...She suggested that I let go of my inhibitions and open up like Hollywood models,” Chopra said. She added that after the shoot, Jhunjhunw-ala used her laptop to transfer the data from a memory card into the hard drive, then formatted the memory card and gave it to the cameraman. A few more co-ncepts were shot later. The hotel management stopped the shoot as permissions were not taken. Dubey was arrested on March 31 and Jhunjhunwala on April 1. The founder of the tech startup told TOI that Jhunjhunwala had quit in October 2019, and he was not aware of ‘Chocolate’ being shot for his firm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/obscene-video-case-tech-startup-ex-staff-among-two-arrested-in-mumbai/articleshow/81878612.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Kolkata||Power snag halts Metro services for an hour||Kolkata: Power failure at Central station led to disruption in Metro services for an hour on Friday. Commuters were completely taken by surprise when electricity at the substation tripped at 11.25am and trains came to a halt. Metro ran truncated services between Maidan and Kavi Subhas stations and from Girish Park to Dakshineswar during the time. “A train was reversed from Maidan and another from Girish Park towards Dakshineswar,” a Metro Railway spokesperson said. Services were restored at 12.26pm. The power failure brought back memories of July 2017 when Metro trains were stalled and stations went dark, triggering panic among thousands of commuters after a power snag near Rabindra Sadan station. “At that time, the power failure led to a fire. Fortunately, there was no such thing happened today. Good Friday being a holiday, not many commuters were inconvenienced,” said a station superintendent. In the 2017 incident, smoke was seen billowing out of the sub-station off Nehru Children’s Museum. There are five sub-stations — at Rabindra Sadan, Masterda Surya Sen, Jatin Das Park, Central and Shyambazar stations — through which CESC supplies power to Metro. “As I walked into Esplanade station at 11.40pm, I was told that there is no power in the third line and no trains are plying,” said Surabhi Banerjee, a commuter. The Metro authorities curtailed supply from the sub-station to the platforms and the third rail at Central station. Metro engineers immediately set out to rectify the problem and restore normal operation. A section of passengers were harassed though since Metro Railway was running less trains on Good Friday. There were 232 services along the north-south line instead of the usual 252. There were 160 services instead of 172 along the Dakshineswar extension. Mintu Mondol, a company executive, said, “I had to wait for 35 minutes when the snag happened. I was trying to take a train to Noapara from Kavi Subhas and was told that only truncated services are available. I had to take two buses to cover the distance.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/power-snag-halts-metro-services-for-an-hour/articleshow/81877044.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

Priyanka was to address three rallies — in Goalpara (East), Golkaganj and Sarukhetri constituencies — on Friday; these seats will go to polls on April 6, reports Prabin Kalita. In a video message, she said, “I have been exposed to the coronavirus. Although I have tested negative yesterday, the doctors have advised that I self-isolate for a few days.

---||Kolkata||Thousand miles apart, parishioners pray together in Good Friday virtual services||Kolkata: The halls of city churches reverberated with prayers as Good Friday services were held in the afternoon. Church-goers attended in large numbers and efforts were made to socially distance them. Hindi and Bengali services were held in different halls of the church premise so that there is no crowding. Additionally, many churches arranged to webcast the services so that seniors could virtually join in. Many parishioners who live abroad now also joined in virtually to be part of the “home” services. Many described this as one positive that the pandemic has helped to bring in from last year. Many started with the ritual Seven Churches Visitation since early morning. Dressed in black to signify mourning and sorrow, they moved from one church to another on foot (many were barefoot as tradition demands), making a round of the seven churches of their choice. Number seven signifies the seven holy sites related to Jesus’s arrest and trial. Apart from the two main cathedrals of the city — Cathedral of the Most Holy Rosary, the main church of the Catholics where Archbishop Thomas D’Souza was the main celebrant and the St Paul’s Cathedral, the main church of the Church of North India — other churches that saw a large turnout were St Thomas, Middleton Row, St Mary’s Ripon Street, Prabhu Jishu Girja, Wellington, St Anthony’s Chapel Market Street, Church of Christ the King in Park Circus, Sacred Heart Church in Dharamtalla, Church of our Lady of Vailankanni in Picnic Gardens, Union Chapel on Lenin Sarani and St Thomas Church on Free School Street. Bishop Paritosh Canning chose to move to smaller churches for the Good Friday service this year and read mass at St Thomas Church, Howrah and St Peter’s Church, Behala. “I did my round of the seven churches and then watched the Passion service live from the Cathedral of the Most Holy Rosary where the Archbishop spoke,” said educator Janet Gasper Chowdhury. “I am engulfed with mixed feelings of sadness and hope. When the biblical passages are read out to relive the sufferings of Jesus, it is too overwhelming,” said Monica Vincent, another educator. “Jesus died taking in all the pain and suffering in his stride and still asked for forgiveness. Let us pray for such resilience,” said vicar general Dominic Gomes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/thousand-miles-apart-parishioners-pray-together-in-good-friday-virtual-services/articleshow/81877068.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Agra||Agra: Pest stains back on Taj walls||AGRA: With crowds returning to the Taj Mahal and Yamuna water getting filthier post Covid lockdown, green and black stains have once again started appearing on the marble walls of the Mughal-era monument due to another attack by the insects. The scientific wing of Archeological Survey of India (ASI) has started cleaning the stains with normal water as they don’t want to use chemicals which could damage the intricate designs, floral mosaics and the marble surface of the monument. However, final cleaning is being done with distilled water. Confirming this, superintending archaeological chemist MK Bhatnagar said that though stains were spotted on the wall, they are still less as compared to earlier years. “Black and green patches appear due to excreta deposited by a particular species of insect, Goeldichironomus, during the months of April and October at the time of variation in temperature,” he said, adding that it will disappear once mercury starts rising. TOI had in May last year reported that the insects attacking the 17th century monument had stayed away due to a cleaner Yamuna and minimal human activity around the premises owing to the Covid-induced lockdown. Talking to TOI, superintending archaeologist in ASI’s Agra circle, Vasant Swarnkar, said, “We regularly monitor and observe the developments but a long-term solution to the issue is to clean the river properly and maintain flowing water levels in the Yamuna.” A study by ASI’s science branch in 2016 to look into the reasons behind the phenomenon had revealed that a polluted Yamuna is responsible for green patches on the iconic monument.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/pest-stains-back-on-taj-walls/articleshow/81877075.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The Centre was working to make TN youth job-providers instead of being job-seekers, Modi said. He said Madurai, the seat of Tamil culture, was an example of Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas as it had embraced people from the Saurashtra community who had come from Gujarat centuries ago. They had also welcomed Telugu-speakers. Congress and DMK, which tried to project themselves as protectors of Tamil culture and language, worked against them in 2011 by banning jallikattu. “A UPA leader called jallikattu a barbaric act. Is something closely associated with Tamil culture a barbaric act,” he asked. Modi said he had always been sensitive to the needs of Tamil people and had passed the ordinance to allow jallikattu in 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/tamil-nadu/in-tamil-nadu-pm-modi-uses-upa-stand-on-jallikattu-to-attack-congress/articleshow/81880581.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Sulur may not be a cakewalk for 2-time winner AIADMK||Coimbatore: The political environment has undergone a sea change in Sulur constituency since the last assembly poll. While the segment had favoured the AIADMK and its then ally DMDK in the 2016 and 2011 polls, respectively, this outing won’t be a cakewalk for the ruling party.While the AIADMK candidate, R Kanagaraj, had won by a margin of 36,631 votes in 2016, in the 2019 bypoll, which was necessitated after his death, the party’s winning margin had dipped to nearly 10,000 votes. Yet, the party has reposed its faith on V P Kandhasamy and given him a second chance to contest from the seat.And Kandhasamy is pitted against Kongunadu Makkal Desiya Katchi (KMDK)’s Premier Selvam, who enjoys unbridled backing of the DMK and alliance partners. Hence, the segment would witness a close, nail biting contest. The new entrants - the Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) and the Amma Makkal Munnettra Kazhagam (AMMK) - have also fielded their candidates from the constituency, which will see a split in traditional vote banks. If the shrinking winning margin is any indication, it would be extremely difficult for Kandhasamy to retain the MLA seat. While the voters in the segment, which comprises Sulur, Sulthanpet and Karumathampatti blocks, had put their weight behind the AIADMK and its allies thrice since 2011, they don’t seem to be impressed with the party’s contribution to the segment. There is a general feeling among the electorate that the ruling dispensation hadn’t done much for the constituency’s infrastructure development in the past 10 years. As such, there is a perceptible anti-incumbency factor working against the party.Vijaykumar, an environmentalist living at Sulur, said while both the AIADMK and KMDK candidates represent the dominant gounder community and have equal pros and cons, Selvam had an edge over Kandhasamy, as he was supported by the DMK and allies. “There is a growing talk and belief that the DMK stands a high chance of winning and forming the government, while people prefer voting the ruling party out of power.”It doesn’t however, mean Kandhasamy isn’t popular in the segment. A resident of Sulthanpat in the constituency, he is acceptable among the electorate, approachable and attends a lot of local functions. But people are upset with the AIADMK workers in the area.K Selvam, another resident, said, “There is a growing frustration. AIADMK workers, who are seemingly jobless, are getting richer every year. They take commissions for every small work like approvals, ration card, old age pensions, etc. There is corruption.”With Sulur still lacking infrastructure, there is also disillusionment with the government. The constituency, which extends from Samalapuram in the east to Kamakshipuram in the west, and from Mayilampatti in the north to Salaipudur in the south, doesn’t have a government hospital with mortuary, and a government polytechnic or arts college.R Boominathan, a farmer, said, “Even accident victims battling for life have to be rushed to the government hospital, which is 45km away. The government is also yet to come up with a solution for white fly menace.”The indefinite delay in desilting Sulur tank and widening of 7.5km-long Chinthamanipudur-Kangayampalayam Road has also not gone down well with the electorate.Political observers say there is already a wave in favour of the DMK. Not because that Selvam has promised the voters much, except wavier of power loom workers’ loans “commission free governance”. Already, presidents of seven village panchayats and the union vice-chairman have moved to the DMK. “Many AIADMK voters have also stepped away after former mayor SM Veluchamy was ignored and isolated, and not working for Kandhasamy,” K Selvam said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/sulur-may-not-be-a-cakewalk-for-2-time-winner-aiadmk/articleshow/81877099.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal assembly polls 2021: Amphan-hit Sunderbans islands see low turnout||GOSABA/KOLKATA: The four island blocks in South 24 Parganas that went to polls on Thursday registered a low turnout — 79.6% — in comparison to earlier assembly elections in the district. It was also the lowest among the three other districts — East Midnapore, West Midnapore and Bankura — where polls were conducted simultaneously. While apathy towards lower-level turncoats and allegations of Amphan aides’ corruption and cut money from embankment construction were touted as some of the reasons behind the low turnout, the ruling party blamed the difficult terrain and sweltering heat for the low percentage. On Thursday, four assembly seats — Gosaba, Patharpratima, Kakdwip and Sagar — in the Sunderbans went to polls on Thursday. The remaining 27 will go to polls in third and fourth phases. “My entire family has been staunch supporters of Mamata Banerjee. I admire her but not her footsoldiers in this village. Almost a year has passed since Amphan but my family is yet to get a rupee as financial aid. On the other hand, there have been several men close to the Trinamool leadership in our village who have received the aid even when their homes were not damaged,” said a resident of Sagar island. The administration had estimated that the cyclone had damaged some 60,000 odd homes in the Sunderbans. Banerjee had announced that Rs 20,000 would be transferred to the bank accounts of each of the 5 lakh families affected by the cyclone and even assured an additional Rs 28,000 to each family under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Generation Scheme. Cut money allegations over embankment construction and alleged violence during the panchayat elections also stopped some from casting their votes as they went about on usual work — catching crabs — instead of heading to the polling booths. “While the rest of the village was busy with the polls, we decided to fetch crabs without much competition. There is no point in voting,” said a resident of Lahiripur under Gosaba.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/amphan-hit-sunderbans-islands-see-low-turnout/articleshow/81858252.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

It is learnt that suspended API Sachin Waze allegedly handed over Hiran to the killers in Thane and created an alibi that he was in Dongri for official work. Investigations have pointed out that the trio was reportedly aware of Waze’s plan. One has already been questioned and another is under the scanner for holding meetings with Waze and the retired cop. The NIA is focusing on two meetings at the police headquarters on March 2 and 3. Sources said that the March 2 meeting, which went on for three hours, was attended by the IPS officer, the retired cop and Waze. On March 3, a meeting was held at the Crime Intelligence Unit office attended by Waze, arrested constable Vinayak Shinde, and a police inspector of another crime branch unit. One of the senior officers under scanner had reportedly left instructions with Thane police to extend logistics support to the conspirators who participated in the killing. TOI has learnt that NIA investigations indicate that initial plans hatched in November 2020 were to plant explosives in a stolen vehicle, identify two members of an outlawed organisation and kill them in a fake encounter near Ambani’s residence. Sources said that the Maruti Eeco was stolen from Aurangabad with this plan in mind. The car belonged to Vijay Nade, a clerk with the social justice department in Jalna, who had lodged a complaint of theft with the City Chowk police station there. The vehicle is not yet traced, but the number plate was recovered from Mithi River along with Waze’s CPU, laptop, hard drives and DVRs on Sunday. The NIA, with the help of anti-terrorism squad, is looking for the Maruti Eeco. Nade is not part of the conspiracy, officials said. However, Waze’s plan went awry as he got stuck with the Television Rating Point manipulation scam probe and in the modified scheme of things, it was decided to plant gelatin sticks only. The motive is still not clear. It is also learnt that Waze handed over Mansukh to the killers in Thane and created an alibi that he was in Dongri for official work. A hotelier who had come to hand over a hafta collection of Rs 1.7 crore to Waze claimed that he overheard policemen trying to convince Mansukh to take responsibility. Waze had asked Mansukh to take responsibility for the explosives-laden car and had promised to bail him out immediately. The hotelier, who has now become a witness to the meeting, told NIA officials that he overheard Mansukh coming in and out of Waze’s cabin and mumbling to himself as to why he should take the responsibility when he had not done anything wrong. On March 4, around 6.30pm, Waze left CIU office leaving his mobile phone behind. He was captured on the CCTV camera waiting for the train at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. “He reached Thane around 8.10pm and called Mansukh at 8.20pm from a SIM card procured through an accomplice from Gujarat. He asked Mansukh to meet him at Ghodbunder Road, but told him to tell his wife that he was going to meet an inspector Tawde as Mansukh’s family was upset with Waze. Waze picked him up in his Audi car in which there were already three people, including Shinde,” said a source. Waze is believed to have handed over Mansukh to his killers and at 9.20pm, took a train to Byculla. He proceeded to Dongri and asked his subordinate Riyazuddin Kazi to get his phone from his office, sources said. And then at 10.30 pm, Waze went to Dongri police station and informed that he was carrying out searches in some hotels. “This was an alibi to hoodwink the investigators,” an official said. Officials suspect that Mansukh was smothered to death in a running car and his body was dumped in a Mumbra creek. Police said that Waze later went to his office at the police headquarters. Mansukh’s body was found on March 5. Meanwhile, the NIA continued questioning a woman who was seen with Waze in a five-star hotel and travelled with him in the Audi. NIA declined to comment on her role.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/wazegate-2-sr-officers-retired-cop-under-lens/articleshow/81883546.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Meerut||Publisher in UP apologizes, recalls all textbooks carrying imaginary photo of Prophet||MUZAFFARNAGAR: A prominent publisher of school textbooks and examination guides in Uttar Pradesh has tendered an apology and claimed to have recalled all the copies carrying imaginary photographs of Prophet Muhammad after objection from Islamic seminary Darul Uloom. According to most Islamic scholars, depiction of the Prophet is prohibited in the religion. The managing director of the publishing house has written a letter to Saharanpur MP Fazlur Rehman telling him that it was an “inadvertent” error and the books have been recalled from the market. This came a day after the Islamic seminary raised objection to the imaginary photograph and demanded action against the publisher. Earlier, the Saharanpur MP and scores of Deoband clerics had approached administration seeking action against the company for hurting the religious sentiments. They had also given a memorandum addressed to the President. On Thursday, Darul had condemned it. Vice-chancellor of the seminary, Maulana Abul Qasim Nomani, said, “There is no picture of Prophet Muhammad, and publishing an imaginary image is condemnable. We strongly condemn it. Administration and government should take strong action against the publication house.” When contacted, MP Rehman said, “We received an apology letter on Friday from the publication house. They assured us that all books have been removed from the market and destroyed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/publisher-in-up-apologizes-recalls-all-textbooks-carrying-imaginary-photo-of-prophet/articleshow/81877085.cms||Mohd Dilshad

---||Delhi||Every 4th containment zone in Delhi lies in south district||NEW DELHI: The number of containment zones on Friday stood at 2,338, a 79% increase since March 26 when their figure was 1,307. Out of these, the number of active zones is 2,007. Moreover, every fourth zone is in just one district, South. Delhi recorded 3,594 fresh Covid-19 cases on Friday. South district accounts for 528 (26.3%) active zones. In fact, other localities that fall under South East district, like Lajpat Nagar and Greater Kailash, or areas in New Delhi district like Vasant Vihar, have taken the total number of active containment zones in the southern part of the city to 868 (43% of all red zones). The second highest containment zones are in North district. While South district has a total of 586 red zones (528 active), North has 325 containment zones of which 278 are active. Two other districts with more than 200 active zones are West (257) and South East (210), followed closely by New Delhi (192 active zones) and North West (187). A distant seventh on the list is South West district with 133 active zones. However, till date, it has seen the highest number of containment zones being created among all districts at 3,833. On the other side of the city, the lowest number of active zones (52) are in East district. The nearby North East (53) and Shahdara (64) districts also have a lower number of red zones, apart from Central district (53). The data of containment zones sheds light on a new phenomenon: most of the Covid-19 hotspots are now in upscale or middle-class residential areas. In fact, the number of such areas is overwhelmingly high compared with containment zones being created in the more congested unauthorised colonies or slum clusters. A look at the distribution of containment zones reveals that south Delhi’s Vasant Kunj has the highest number of active zones at 58. This is followed closely by Pitampura, which has 57 active zones spread across its different blocks, and then 51 red zones distributed between Greater Kailash-I and II, apart from nine active zones in nearby East of Kailash. Next among the top hotspots are the sprawling sub-cities of Dwarka (50) and Rohini (46), followed by Pashchim Vihar (37) and south Delhi’s tony Vasant Vihar (35). The other three among the top 10 are Mukherjee Nagar (33) in north Delhi and south Delhi’s RK Puram (29) and Lajpat Nagar (26), even though the last two fall under the jurisdiction of New Delhi and South East districts, respectively. Delhi is now facing its fourth Covid wave, which has pushed up the number of containment zones compared with November 2020 when Delhi was witnessing its third and deadliest wave of the disease. The scenario is currently starkly different from then. On November 9, 2020, Delhi had 2,549 active containment zones and the three biggest hotspots of that period — Burari with a staggering 97 red zones, Najafgarh (81) and Kalkaji (73) — have 10 or fewer zones now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/every-4th-containment-zone-in-delhi-lies-in-south-district/articleshow/81877991.cms||Sidharatha Roy

They allegedly consumed the liquor on Thursday night. The man who suffered damage to his eyesight has been referred to Aligarh medical college in serious condition. Four persons, including the former village head, have been arrested while three licensed shops were sealed after they were found to be selling spurious liquor. The shop from where the liquor was purchased was in the name of one Mala Singh and police are trying to arrest her. “Action will also be taken against the excise inspector, local police out-post in-charge and several others,” said senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Budaun Sankalp Sharma. Spurious liquor continues to flow in parts of Uttar Pradesh which is going to polls to elect local body representatives next month. On Thursday, two persons died in Ayodhya while the death toll in Pratapgarh hooch tragedy climbed to seven. Last week, four persons had died in Pratapgarh district while eight had succumbed in Chitrakoot. District magistrate Deepa Ranjan along with the SSP rushed to the village and met the family members of the deceased. The bodies were sent for autopsy and the kin were assured of compensation. The victims were identified as Sanjay Singh and Premdas. Amar Singh lost eyesight. SSP Sharma told TOI, “The liquor was distributed by Satyabhan and Ram Swaroop who are planning to contest upcoming Zila Panchayat elections. Money was given to Ram Kishore who bought liquor from the licensed shop of Mala Singh. Satyabhan’s younger brother Brijbhan was also involved in the distribution. All four were arrested and during questioning we found that several other people are involved in this spurious liquor racket.” “During investigation, we found that spurious liquor was packed and sold as genuine for quick money. The bottles, caps and packaging labels having barcodes were supplied by another person. The role of liquor store staff is also being probed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/spurious-liquor-served-by-panchayat-poll-aspirants-leaves-2-dead-another-without-eyesight-in-ups-budaun/articleshow/81877091.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Annamalai, who is BJP state vice-president, said he is capable of thrashing Senthil Balaji, but he has decided not to resort to violence after joining politics. Annamalai said at a campaign in a village in Aravakurichi that two BJP supporters were hospitalised after being attacked by DMK men when their women’s wing secretary K Kanimozhi was campaigning in Karur a few days ago. He is being provoked by such attacks to retaliate but they would take up the matter with the election commission. He said he has handled many criminals in Karnataka and is capable of thrashing Senthil Balaji as well. Since he has entered politics, he has decided not to resort to violence, he said. Based on his remark, Senthil Balaji lodged a complaint at the Aravakurichi police station. Annamalai was booked under section 153 (provocation with intent to cause riot) and 506 (1) (punishment for criminal intimidation) of IPC. Responding to the comments, Kanimozhi dared Annamalai to touch a man from DMK let alone attack. “The party has come this far facing many such threats and challenges. No one can threaten us. If we stand up against such threats, you may not be able to bear it,” she said. Karur Lok Sabha MP S Jothimani said Annamalai is crossing all limits in fear of defeat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/annamalai-booked-for-provocative-speech/articleshow/81878621.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||In faceoff with Special Cell, two snatchers shot at in Delhi, held||NEW DELHI: Two notorious snatchers were injured in an encounter with Special Cell of Delhi Police early on Friday in Rohini. DCP Sanjeev Kumar Yadav said the two snatchers, Mahesh Bholi and Mohit Deepak, were collectively involved in about 100 criminal cases. Police seized two pistols with five cartridges from them. The operation comes in the wake of a drive launched against trigger-happy criminals who fire at or kill people during street crimes. Bholi and Deepak had committed back-to-back violent crimes in the last one month. “On March 22, they shot dead a man named Sameer accusing him of being a police informer. On March 16, they shot at and critically injured a man named Pravesh in an extortion bid. On March 28, the criminals snatched a car at gunpoint in Narela and stole a bike from Bawana for committing snatching. They also grabbed a bag containing money and valuables from a man in Narela,” said Yadav. Declared a “bad character” by Narela police station, Bholi was found involved in over 70 cases, while Deepak was involved in more than 25 cases. The two took to crime again after coming out of jail last year. Acting on a tip-off that the duo was going to Rohtak through Helipad Road in Rohini, a trap was laid by a police team around 2.30am. The road was blocked off using barricades. “Around 3am, two people arrived on a motorcycle. When they were intercepted, they took a U-turn and tried to flee by riding on the wrong carriageway. They were chased by police and signalled to stop, but they continued to speed away. However, they soon lost control of the motorcycle and fell off near Sector 37 in Rohini,” said the DCP. On being asked to surrender, the duo took out their pistols and started firing at the policemen. They fired five rounds, two of which hit the bulletproof jackets worn by ASI Sandeep Kumar and head constable Sachin. In retaliatory firing, the criminals got shot in their legs. Both were then overpowered and taken to a hospital for treatment. Police are looking for their associates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-faceoff-with-special-cell-two-snatchers-shot-at-held/articleshow/81878625.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Lucknow-Kanpur express highway to be complete by December 2022: Nitin Gadkari||LUCKNOW: Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari has promised UP its first express highway between Lucknow and Kanpur, which will reduce the travel time between the two cities by half, before the end of 2022. At present, it takes nearly two hours to cover the 90-km distance between Lucknow and Kanpur. In Lucknow on Friday with defence minister Rajnath Singh for the inauguration of a flyover at Tedhipulia and the foundation laying ceremony of another flyover at Khurram Nagar, Gadkari said that he will be back in Lucknow within the next three to four months to start work on this project, as desired by Singh. At present, it takes between 1.5 to 2 hours to drive between the two cities. The minister made several significant announcements for UP, including an increase in budget from Rs 1,500 crore to Rs 11,500 crore for construction of bridges and rail overbridges on national highways, development of the 84 kosi parikrama at Ayodhya and giving it the status of a national highway, completion of major infrastructure projects within the next two years and construction of 25-30 ring roads. “We had an agreement with the state government for construction of ring roads under which the Centre would give 50% of the funds and the state would acquire 50% of the land. However, the state government is facing several problems in land acquisition because of which many projects are pending,” the minister said, offering that the Centre would acquire the land on the condition that the state government view this as a notional loss and gave exemption on GST for steel and cement and exemption on royalty for aggregate used in construction. “I will approve all 25-30 ring roads if you agree to this. I will also clear proposals for all bridges and ROBs on national highways in one go if the state government agrees to bear the cost of land acquisition. UP has a network of 11,390 km national highways which has gone up by 40% under our government. Works of Rs 2 lakh crore have either been approved or started. I want to complete all these within two years and request the government to bring me these proposals and I will clear them in a single meeting,” he said. Referring to a quote by former US president John F Kennedy which he has displayed in his office, ‘American roads are not good because America is rich. America is rich because it has good roads,’ Gadkari said that to achieve the target of making India a USD 5 trillion economy, Rs 111 lakh crore would be spent on infrastructure over the next five years. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said, had emphasised on infrastructure development to promote industrial development and added that India had no shortage of funds, but only of people who can work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lucknow-kanpur-express-highway-to-be-complete-by-dec-2022-gadkari/articleshow/81878627.cms||Neha Lalchandani

We shall appeal to the district administration to lift the 6pm restriction and allow us to ply sanitised autorickshaws,” said Nitin Pawar, the convener of the Pune Autorickshaw Association. Nitin Verma, the vice-president of the Pune Taxi Association, said, “Already, taxi operators are running into losses and we want the administration to reconsider the decision. We shall continue to offer emergency taxi services after 6pm.” Maharashtra Rickshaw Panchayat president Baba Kamble said, “Autorickshaws were out of service for more than three months during the lockdown last year. Now, the new restrictions would literally finish them. People are already avoiding going out. Our members could earn only Rs200 per day now. The new restrictions would curtail their earnings by 50%. Due to heat, people prefer to go out in the evenings. Now, we shall have to sit idle at home. Some states have given compensation to the autorickshaw drivers, but we have no such relief yet.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/auto-union-to-appeal-to-lift-post-6pm-restriction/articleshow/81877987.cms||---

---||Pune||Bapat warns against harsh enforcement of travel curbs||Pune: MP Girish Bapat on Friday opposed the administration’s decision to shut eateries and restrict the use of PMPMPL buses only for essential services, besides stressing that the police should ensure that they do not beat up common people while enforcing the 6pm-to-6am travel restrictions. “The police presence on the streets should serve as a deterrence to people but they should not feel terrorised by the police,” Bapat said. Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta sought to allay fears about police excesses or undue harassment during the enforcement of restrictions. “Our intent is not to harass people. Rather, we have asked all our officers and men on ground to adopt a humane approach and understand people’s problems rather than go about mechanically with the enforcement. They will sensitise people to follow the state directives.” Gupta said, “The Covid review meet on Friday decided to close food joints, hotels, restaurants, shops and malls by 6pm. Hence, we suggested why should people come out on the roads after 6pm then. People should purchase vegetables, fruits, grocery items and other essentials before this deadline. The idea is to break the chain of the spread of coronavirus. The officials considered our request.” He said, “The ban on assembly of more than five persons at one place will be enforced in public places like railway stations and bus stands and places which draw crowds or wherever crowding is witnessed. Violators will be booked under Section 188 (disobedience) of the IPC.” The police chief said, “The night travel restriction won’t impact the vaccination drive it is held during daytime. There will be restrictions on cabs and autorickshaws, and people travelling to or from railway stations and airport should furnish travel documents like tickets or boarding passes. People visiting hospitals for treatment should furnish medical documents. Doctors, nurses and people travelling to hospital/offices late in the night should keep identity cards and letters specifying their duty hours.” Deputy commissioner of police (special branch) Mitesh Ghatte said, “Around 4,000 police would be deployed at 120 check posts and 13 fixed points. We shall be getting additional manpower of 400 policemen for maintaining bandobast in the city from Saturday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bapat-warns-against-harsh-enforcement-of-travel-curbs/articleshow/81877979.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The member of parliament (MP) and descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Sambhaji Raje Bhosale, visited the fort to inspect the old ornament. Officer on special duty of the Raigad Development Authority, Malojirao Jagdale, told TOI, “The gold bangle which weighs around 2.5 tolas (30gm) was discovered from one of the 15 excavation sites at the Raigad fort. We referred it to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), who also feels prima facie, this ornament could be from the time of Chhatrapati Shivaji.” While interacting with the officials atop the fort, MP Raje Bhosale, who heads the Raigad Development Authority, said, “The site where the bangle has been found was possibly a house of a senior ranking soldier. Further excavations here may lead to more discoveries.” In March 2018, the Pune based student researchers of Deccan College had discovered ancient artefacts from Raigad fort —including pieces of pottery, a coin and a lead bullet. “The Raigad fort is steeped in history. The coronation of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj also took place here in 1674 AD,” said Jagdale. History buff and fort aficionado, Vishnu Gavali, added, “Glimpses of history that had remained buried for centuries, has resurfaced. Possibly, historical books or granths may also see light of the day soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-3-century-old-gold-bangle-excavated-at-raigad-fort-site/articleshow/81878632.cms||Vijay Singh

While representatives from the manufacturing and service sector were relieved that there was no blanket lockdown, they expressed some concern that the lack of public transport would affect workers and smaller companies. For a few weeks, industry associations held frequent parleys with local administration officials, exhorting them to avoid a lockdown and instead, step up vaccinations to battle the second wave of the pandemic. “We welcome the decision of no lockdown in Pune,” read a joint statement by Sudhir Mehta and Prashant Girbane, president and director-general respectively of the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture. They said the suspension of PMPML bus services would impact workers engaged in multiple shifts, especially those who cannot afford their own vehicles. “Retail and contact-based services sector would be further hit. Heightened uncertainty has unsettled state migrant labourers. If they leave, it will be a massive setback to the recovery process,” the statement added. An industry representative said most micro, small, and medium-scale enterprises would not be able to afford to hire private buses to ferry their employees to and from work and suggested that PMPML buses be organized for them. The local chapter of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) also urged authorities to keep public transport running. “We will continue to discuss the public transportation issue with the divisional commissioner, the local police, and other authorities. The only viable (non-lockdown) solution is to vaccinate all citizens over 18 years old in the worst-affected districts or municipal corporations. Maharashtra does have the resources and infrastructure to do this. Priority must be given to areas like Pune that are most affected by the pandemic,” Deepak Garg, chairman of CII’s Pune zonal council and managing director of Sany India, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/relieved-theres-no-shutdown-logistics-a-concern-industries/articleshow/81878004.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Lucknow||Nitin Gadkari approves khadi, zari clusters, 2 flatted units in UP||LUCKNOW: Union minister Nitin Gadkari has given in-principle nod to set up three clusters in Uttar Pradesh: one for fusion khadi work, another for zari zardosi work, and two flatted factories. Gadkari and defence minister Rajnath Singh, who were in Lucknow on Friday, met state MSME minister Sidharth Nath Singh and discussed the possibility of setting up clusters under a central scheme. Among the various ideas floated, the UP minister proposed three ideas to which Gadkari has given an in-principal nod. Under the cluster policy, in which the maximum limit for a single cluster is Rs 15 crore, the Centre contributes 60% while the state government’s share is 40%. “The three of us met on Friday to discuss the possibility of having clusters in UP and I am very happy that Gadkariji has agreed to these three proposals. These projects will not just generate employment but also give a boost to exports from UP. We will formulate proposals for the three schemes very soon and send them for formal clearance to the Centre,” Sidharth Nath Singh said. In the fusion cluster for khadi, zari zardosi work and chikankari embroidery will be done on fabric. Singh said the cluster would also host facilities for training workers, provide help with machinery and assistance in branding the final product. The other cluster will be for zari zardosi work. Lucknow sees a lot of manufacturing of burqas and abayas for export to Saudi Arabia, the minister said, adding that if these can be embellished with traditional embroidery, then the market for these will improve tremendously. The third cluster pertains to two flatted factories. These will support non-polluting manufacturing work like tailoring, handmade or machine-made leather goods, pickle units, etc. The state already has flatted factories or plans to set up such units in Agra, Kanpur and Gorakhpur. In June 2020, UP State Industrial Development Authority had adopted a policy to allow flatted factories in the state. These are multi-storeyed buildings in which multiple non-polluting industrial units can operate. The concept allows more activity in a limited space and considerably less investment by a unit which only has to pay rentals. Minimum land requirement of 5 acres has been set for development of such a factory which cannot be developed in a residential area or mixed land use area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/gadkari-approves-khadi-zari-clusters-2-flatted-units-in-up/articleshow/81878646.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Earlier, 126 buses used to ply on Meerut roads. However, they were taken off the roads two years ago as they were old as per NGT norms. In their place, the Uttar Pradesh government approved 150 CNG and electric vehicles. But most of these vehicles are yet to arrive. “As many as five CNG buses have been made operational in Meerut as of now. However, more buses will be brought from Kanpur. While all other paperwork is complete, the work of insurance and transfer is incomplete,” said Vijay Kumar, managing director, Meerut City Transport Service Limited. Earlier, the city bus service was hit as a number of illegal buses started plying on the routes meant for the city buses. The move to switch to CNG buses will make the current fleet more identifiable, said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/meerut-city-bus-service-resumes-with-cng-fleet/articleshow/81877104.cms||Ishita Bhatia
---||Delhi||Delhi: St Stephen’s College a hotspot after 17 students, some staffers test Covid-19 positive||NEW DELHI: Delhi University’s St Stephen’s College has become a Covid-19 hotspot with 17 students and staff members testing positive for the disease. The teachers alleged that this occurred following a “chapel trip” of students to Dalhousie. Sources said the college took a group of students during the mid-semester break to Dalhousie from where they returned on March 31. The hostels were opened for students on January 10. As a few stayed back in the hostel, 25 of them were taken for the trip. They were tested after they developed symptoms of the disease. Even a dean, mess steward and security staff reportedly tested positive. A student, on the condition of anonymity, said, “Students were taken on the annual trip like every year. Till Friday afternoon, 17 people had tested positive. The college hasn’t issued any notice regarding the matter.” Associate dean Chinkhalun Guite on Friday issued a notice saying, “All residence junior members who are currently on leave are hereby advised to stay home till further notice.” Teachers who live on the campus or outside are a worried lot as blended learning is going on in the college. A member of the governing body wrote to principal John Varghese and Delhi University raising questions on the matter. The letter mentioned, “In light of reports coming in from students, non-teaching faculty members and some officials, I would like the following information from you. Have some hostel students tested Covid-positive after April 1? Is it true that two officials had accompanied a large group of hostel students on a trip to Dalhousie in the last week of March? Why was this trip organised during the pandemic? Was the trip authorised by the principal and was the consent of parents taken for it?” It was also asked in the letter whether permission was taken from the university and Delhi government for organising the trip. The GB member also asked why the college authorities hadn’t informed the students, teachers and employees about the large number of Covid-positive cases on the campus. “Is withholding information about the presence of positive cases not a violation of Covid protocol?” he further asked. Varghese did not reply to the email sent by TOI. However, a message sent by a college official to the teachers stated, “It is a little delayed, but I would request everyone’s cooperation regarding our present situation. At present, we have 12 students and two staff members who are Covid-positive. The college is under strict lockdown till Monday.” The note to the teachers staying on the campus asked them not to have guests from outside. “Domestic workers can be given permission through the dean’s office. The inner campus is out of bounds till further notice,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/st-stephens-college-a-hotspot-after-17-students-some-staffers-test-ve/articleshow/81878096.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Delhi||Gone with the winter: Civic bid to curb dust pollution in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Unlike winter when all civic bodies make best efforts to curb dust pollution to improve air quality in Delhi, nothing much is happening on ground at present despite dry, dust-laden winds from Rajasthan blowing all over the city. On major roads, especially those on the outskirts and near landfills, loose soil floating in the air because of strong winds is a common sight these days, said Amita Agarwal, a resident of Mayur Vihar phase-3. “The westerly winds are blowing at about 30-40 kmph from Rajasthan. My apartment is next to the main road and I see the floor of my balcony getting covered with a thin layer of dust particles every morning. Even near the Ghazipur landfill, clouds of dust are visible every time we cross the stretch,” she said. A senior East Delhi Municipal Corporation official, however, claimed that they have engaged two sprinkling machines at the landfill and 40 more on roads at three hotspots, including Anand Vihar, Mandoli and Vivek Vihar. “At Anand Vihar, sprinklers are working through the day. We are also making random inspections to ensure there are no lapses. On the rest of the roads also, these machines have been deployed. If required, we will beef up the arrangements near the landfill,” said the official. South Delhi Municipal Corporation also claimed to have deployed 23 mechanical road sweepers, along with sprinklers, to control dust emission. Environmentalist Vimlendu Jha, however, said that authorities hardly get into action unless air quality index (AQI) crosses the 300-mark. “AQI up to 200 is considered to be normal in a city like Delhi where air is polluted due to higher dust concentration. Due to high-speed winds, concentration of pollutants (small particles) in the air might be low these days, but the dust particles continue to be present. Ideally, there is a need for taking steps to mitigate dust pollution through the year,” he said. A senior North Delhi Municipal Corporation official, meanwhile, said that unlike winters when the gasses are diffused in the upper layer, things are not problematic in summers. “Even the dust particles, which are heavy, settle down on the surface after some time and do not lead to breathing issues,” he added. Prof CR Babu, environmentalist and Professor Emeritus, Delhi University, said that the temperature immersion might not take place in spring or summer season, but necessary measures must be implemented throughout the year. “Unlike winter, in this season, cold air flows on the ground and warm in the upper layer so the gases get diffused in the upper layer easily and don’t get trapped in the lower layer. However, dust particles remain in lower levels resulting in dust pollution. Apart from sprinkling, plantations should also be carried out throughout the year,” he explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gone-with-the-winter-civic-bid-to-curb-dust-pollution-in-capital/articleshow/81891561.cms||Vibha Sharma

The stringent restrictions announced on Friday are going to cause even further problems, observed blood banks. The ban on assembly of people will create obstacles in blood collection. The blood banks and organisers have demanded that big blood donation camps be exempted from restrictions and have appealed to people to donate blood before getting vaccinated. As per the data of the district administration, nearly 800 to 1,000 bags of blood are required every day, but hardly 200 to 400 are being collected. “Planned surgeries are being carried out in most big hospitals. They require blood in bulk,” said Atul Kulkarni, director, Janakalyan Blood bank. “Many regular donors either have tested positive or received vaccination. This has adversely impacted overall blood collection,” said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/shortage-of-blood-in-pmr-as-collection-stands-at-40/articleshow/81877994.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Covid-19 positive students to get 2nd chance if they miss practical exam: CBSE||NAGPUR: As almost every school in Nagpur starts their practical exam from Monday, the CBSE has reiterated that students must not fret if they miss it after testing Covid positive as a second attempt has been guaranteed by the board. There is also no official mandate to produce a medical certificate when attempting the exam for the first time, something about which parents were concerned. A parent said there was confusion as to whether or not students have to produce a medical certificate while going to school on Monday. “My daughter’s practical exam is scheduled for Monday and I do not want a situation where she is denied a chance to appear because of the absence of a certificate,” said the parent. CBSE has urged parents to voluntarily share information about their child being positive. Addressing parents and students during a TOI-organized live social media session, CBSE’s controller of examination Sanyam Bhardwaj said, “We want to create awareness among parents about the need to be proactive. No student will suffer academically because of Covid-19, a second chance will definitely be given to any student who fails to appear for the practical exam.” As per CBSE’s instructions, the practical exam of such Covid-19 positive students must be conducted by June 11. In the first attempt, when the student is absent, the marks column will be updated online with a noting as “C”. Later, when the student appears for the exam, the marks will be sent offline to the CBSE office. As the process of issuing migration certificates is undergoing changes, parents have been informed that the CBSE will issue a digital version by default. This certificate will be uploaded in the student’s digilocker account and if a physical copy is required, an application will have to be given. In this move towards digitalization, migration certificates will be available in digital-only mode by 2024. The board has also warned students against rumours regarding the modified exam schedule that’s floating on various social media platforms. A board official said, “Some people are deliberately trying to create confusion about this year’s board exams by circulating an old circular which was issued last year. Do not be misled, the board has not issued any such information.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-19-positive-students-to-get-2nd-chance-if-they-miss-practical-exam-cbse/articleshow/81877995.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Adani Group to benefit from KSEB’s power purchase deal: Chennithala||T’puram: With only three more days left for elections, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala came up with allegations of a long-term power purchase agreement favouring Adani Group, the financial burden of which will have to be borne by the people of the state. The opposition leader said that the power purchase agreement between the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) and Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd (SECI) has opened up the scope for a profitable business for Adani Group in the state, because of which the people of the state will have to pay extra. Chennithala said that instead of directly entering into agreement with Adani Group, KSEB entered into an agreement with the SECI, which in turn is purchasing the power from Adani wind energy. He said that the government's move favouring the Adani Group is evident from the fact that instead of opting for other cheaper renewable energy sources, government opted for wind energy, in which Adani Group is the key player. He said that the agreement for purchasing 300MW of power produced from wind energy is for 25 years, under the cover of renewable purchase obligation, that mandates the state to purchase 5% of power from renewable energy resources. Chennithala said that as per the agreement, the state will have to pay Rs 2.83 per kWh, plus a trading margin of Rs 0.07 per kWh. While the people of the state will have to pay Rs 1 extra when compared to power available from other renewable sources like solar energy, the Adani Group will make a profit of approximately Rs 1,000 crore, Chennithala said. Also, since it is a long-term power purchase agreement, the people of the state will have to bear the higher cost even when energy charges from such renewable sources are showing a decreasing trend, he said, and added that world over, the long-term power purchase agreements are not entertained now. Chennithala also cited the Thiruvananthapuram airport bidding row to allege that the government has been taking a stand in favour of the Adani Group. He said that while the government openly criticized the Central government move to hand over the airport to Adani Group, it covertly helped the group in the bidding for the airport. He said that the rules say that even if a government-owned company participating in the bid quotes up to 10% less than a private bidder, the bid should be awarded to the government company. But in the case of Thiruvananthapuram airport, the government quoted 12% less than what was quoted by Adani Group, which cannot be considered coincidental. He said that the present power purchase agreement is also a similar one. He added that this also exposes the nexus between Pinarayi Vijayan and Narendra Modi, and Adani Group is the intermediary, who aids Pinarayi Vijayan in matters, including the SNC Lavalin case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/adani-group-to-benefit-from-ksebs-power-purchase-deal-chennithala/articleshow/81877132.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The centre will offer free daily therapy for autistic children from the poor and underprivileged families, who can’t afford treatment at private centres, which charge anywhere between Rs500 and Rs3,000 a day. At least 40 children have registered with the district early intervention centre for the therapy after they were diagnosed with autism. Named Saathvikh, the centre would be run by city-based Third Eye, a learning centre for autism and NGO Sharanalayam. Saranya Babu Prasath, founder of Third Eye, said they would initially deploy a staffer to handle autistic children for an hour each. “One person could handle up to six children a day. We expect the children to come at least five days a week for the therapy.” She said they would hire more staff if they get more children for the programme. They had established a similar centre in Pollachi government hospital two weeks ago. Dr V Booma, head of paediatrics, Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital, said, “It’s the first district early intervention centre in the state to have an ABA centre for autistic children. We hope this will help the poor and underprivileged access the therapy, so that their children can be rehabilitated and allowed to enjoy a normal social life.” The applied behaviour analysis, a popular therapy for autism, is a data driven, result oriented approach.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/free-therapy-for-autistic-children/articleshow/81877107.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

However, since 2016, the city has not witnessed a flyover or RoB proposal materialising, while the population has grown by over 4%.Thiruvanaikoil RoB in Srirangam was the last RoB commissioned for general public use. Although the arterial roads such as the head post office (HPO) signal, Karur bypass road signal and Anna statue junction in Melachinthamani require a flyover, no proposals have been made in the past few years. In the absence of traffic police, Bharathidasan and EVR roads that comprise hospitals, district court and central government offices witness persistent bottlenecks. “We have been repeatedly demanding the authorities to propose flyovers, particularly, on Karur bypass road where buses from western districts enter the city. No elected representatives took up the suggestions seriously in the past five years,” Saravanan Natesan, a road safety activist said. Fort station RoB, which was damaged in the recent rains is sanctioned for reconstruction work but no proposal was suggested to develop a replacement for the century-old structure. State highways sources added that only the Trichy junction to Melachinthamani elevated highway project is on the cards, which has seen no progress in the last six years. Residents have asked parties to draft clear plans for decongesting the city by establishing flyovers on arterial roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-traffic-bursts-at-seams-but-no-proposal-for-flyovers/articleshow/81878642.cms||Deepak Karthik

He shall provide the requisite medical treatment to the applicant and report the compliance,” the court said. In a plea submitted and argued by advocate Sharif Shaikh, the accused Munib Iqbal Menon, who has been in jail for eight years, told the court that among undertrial prisoners, only those booked for murder can be made to wear the uniform. The accused is booked for attempt to murder and under sections of Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA). The plea said that making him dress as a convict is bound to cause metal stress and trauma as fundamentals of the criminal jurisprudence is the presumption of innocence until proven guilty. The plea said that on January 22, the court directed the superintendent to get the accused medically examinedand advised to provide sufficient food.  It said that, in compliance of the order, the prison’s chief medical officer was ready to take him to hospital, but he refused to go as the officer insisted he wear the convict uniform. Menon had then moved the court. His plea said that studies had found that long incarceration due to delay in trial causes psychological trauma among inmates. “That asking the applicant (Menon) to dress as a convict is against his right to dignity as recognized under Article 21 (Protection of life and personal liberty) of the Indian Constitution. That asking the applicant to dress as a convict before the public is a violation of his right to a fair trial,” the plea said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-convict-uniform-not-must-for-jm-rd-blast-accused/articleshow/81878682.cms||Rebecca Samervel

As such, the 6pm to 6am travel curbs will not have much of an effect on them. The physical campuses of IT and BPO firms are currently occupied by a skeletal staff of technology support employees, whose job is to look after maintenance of servers. A small group of tech engineers are kept on stand-by to attend office on an as-is-required basis. However, despite the overwhelming work-from-home culture in the information technology sector, industry collectives expected some tweaks from companies vis-a-vis night shifts, crucial for firms with global operations. Nearly all night shifts at information technology firms begin well past the 6pm deadline to sync with overseas time zones. “As per our communications with the industries department, there should not be a problem if company vehicles transport a limited number of employees late at night. Companies may also move some shifts, such as bringing in employees before the 6pm deadline,” said Col Charanjeet Singh Bhogal (retd), chief operating officer, Hinjewadi Industries Association, which represents dozens of players in the information technology sector in the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/extensive-wfh-to-even-out-effects-on-tech-firms/articleshow/81878007.cms||---

They also requested the staff to get signature from the gazette officer at the training centre and deposit the postal ballot paper in a sealed envelop at the centre itself. S Arunan, president, Tamil Nadu Government Employees and Teachers’ Welfare Association, said many of their votes were rejected in the previous election for not obtaining signature from the gazette officer. “To avoid this, we have requested the staff to obtain signature from the officer at the training centre and not to bring the ballots outside. This will help avoid unwanted complications, including political influence.” Pointing out that many of them were not communicated about the availability of postal ballots during the last election training session on March 26, a teacher, who didn’t want to be identified, said it was the responsibility of election officials to ensure 100% voting of the staff on poll duty. “In the next training session on Saturday, they should distribute postal ballots to all the staff.” The teachers also demanded the Election Commission to declare holiday on Wednesday, as they would be working till late night on Tuesday, when the state goes to poll. “It will be too hectic for us to work without proper rest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/ensure-100-voting-of-staff-on-poll-duty-teachers-tell-officials/articleshow/81877123.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In the last seven days after cancellation of the first paper, nearly 5,000 students have missed their exams. As per the circular issued by NU Board of Examinations and Evaluation (BoEE) director Prafulla Sable, the papers of BE seventh semester (all branches) would be conducted on Sunday along with BSc (Home Science) fifth semester, BBA fifth semester and BALLB ninth semester. The BCom fifth semester papers would be held on Tuesday and BSc fifth semester on Wednesday. The BA fifth semester paper of philosophy is rescheduled on Thursday. TOI on Wednesday had reported how students continue to face problems due to issues like slow connectivity, power disruptions and others. On Friday,175 students missed the exams while on Thursday, about 1,200 couldn’t appear, as per the data provided by NU. The Maharashtra Students Welfare Association (MSWA) has appealed to higher education minister Uday Samant to pay personal attention and ensure that those who missed the exams due to any reason are granted another chance. Aggrieved students have raised several complaints on the social media account of MSWA. “Due to university’s blunders and inadequate preparations, several students are unable to appear for the online exams. It’s leading to their harassment, as they don’t know about their fate,” said Vaibhav Edke, MSWA president. The ABVP and BJYM had already asked NU administration to reschedule the exams of these students because they were not at fault. # Dates of rescheduled papers * BSc (Home Sc) 5th sem ------ April 4 -------- 8am to 11am * BBA (CBS) 5th sem ----------- April 4 ------- 8am to 11am * BE 7th sem –------------------ April 4 –-------- 11.30am to 2.30pm * BALLB 9th sem -------------- April 4 ------—- 3pm to 6pm * BCom 5th sem ------------—- April 6 ------------ 8am to 11am * BSc 5th sem ------------—— April 7 ----------—- 8am to 11am PAPERS SO FAR Day — Logins — Submissions Mar 25— Paper cancelled Mar 26—20,014 — 18,757 Mar 27—35,269— 33,265 Mar 28—3,946—13,928 Mar 29 — Holi Holiday Mar 30 —35,600—35,388 Mar 31--- 36,820 ---- 36,739 April 1 ----41,899 ----- 40,699 April 2 --- 25,245 ---- 25,070 Total——2,08,793——-2,03,846||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nu-reschedules-exams-of-over-10k-students-from-april-4-7/articleshow/81878014.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Churches were seen teeming with people attending special prayer sessions while priests spread the word of Christ’s selfless love. The day commenced with special morning prayer services known as the ‘Way of the Cross', reminiscing the sufferings of Christ before he was crucified. Following the Covid-19 protocol, unlike previous years, no public processions were taken out this time. Vicar General of Patna Archdiocese Fr Prem Prakash SJ conducted the afternoon mass prayer at St Joseph’s pro-Cathedral at Bankipore. “People visit and pray in front of 14 stations, depicting the events in the last hours of the life of Christ. The ‘Way of the Cross’, reminds the faithful of how much the Lord suffered for humanity,” he said. He added that following the government’s guidelines, only 300 people were allowed at a time on the church premises. Also known as Holy Friday or Black Friday, Good Friday is considered as one of the most sombre days for Catholic Christians during the Holy Week. They believe that Jesus was crucified on Good Friday and rose again three days later - which is marked as Easter. The three days are known as the Easter Triduum.  “Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, Holy Saturday and Easter Sunday marks each step of Christ’s journey from the last supper and washing of his disciples feet till his death and resurrection. Good Friday is not a celebration but a day of sorrow, penance, and fasting,” Fr Michael Pius Prasant SJ, parish priest at Queen of Apostle Church at Kurji said. Ayush Bhatti, while offering prayers at St Joseph’s Pro-Cathedral in Bankipore said, “Good Friday is a day on which Catholics ask for forgiveness of their sins from the Christ. I along with my family attended the devotional address, adoration of the cross and evening vigil at the church.” Many who did not fast or participate in community prayers and processions throughout the Lenten season observe it on Good Friday as this day marks the end of the of season. . “Some of us fast, the rest abstain from consuming any non-vegetarian food. As a symbol of sorrow, we cover the cross, paintings and idols of Christ with black or purple colour clothes,” said a Boring road resident Varghese Thomas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/prayer-fast-mark-good-friday-in-city/articleshow/81877141.cms||---

The question of availability of transport for the employees at these hours is also important. We request that the government review these issues and give us permission to operate from 10am to 9pm instead.”Rajendra Kalkar, committee member of the Shopping Centres Association of India (SCAI) said, “A shutdown will not only curtail smooth operations but will also deter genuine shoppers from visiting malls and have a spiraling effect on retail business that could derail recovery of the segment. We urge the state government to consider normalized operations of the shopping centres and malls. ”Shashank Pathak, executive director and chief executive officer of Westend Mall at Aundh, said, “We are willing to work with the administration on implementing any reasonable measures that they prescribe, and feel are effective.”“Business had just started to stabilize since the lockdown. Another round of curbs could have serious implications on direct and indirect employment of thousands of individuals in the country and the survival of the shopping centre industry as a whole,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/malls-urge-govt-to-intervene-help-them-stay-afloat/articleshow/81878009.cms||---

According to a government report, till 6pm, a total of 52,408 people got the vaccine, which included 30,764 persons in the 45-59 age group, both with and without comorbid conditions. There is high enthusiasm among people in the 45-59 age group to get vaccinated at a time when the Covid cases are rising at a high speed. The capital reported 3,594 cases on Friday. Only two minor cases of adverse events were reported. Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital reported 100% target achievement with more than 200 people turning out at the vaccination centres to get the jab. “The walk-ins were more than the number of registered individuals who turned out to get the jab. Since the vaccination has been opened for all above 45, the turnout is higher,” said an official. Since 8am, people started turning up outside the vaccination centres, many with identity proof seeking vaccine. Those not so tech-savvy also walked in with their identity cards to get the shot. “From registration at the vaccination centres to vaccination and observation, mostly 1-1.5 hours are needed. The vaccination is going on smoothly without glitches,” said an official at Aruna Asaf Ali Hospital. The Friday turnout is lower as compared to the day before. On Thursday, 56,531 people had got the shot till 6pm. “Since the compilation of the data is a comprehensive exercise, the final turnout data for the day will be known by late night because the vaccination goes on till 9pm,” said a health department official. The 56,531-figure reported till 6pm had increased to 70,000 by 9pm on Thursday. On Friday, the first dose was given to 47,873 people and the second dose to 4,536 individuals. Among those given the first dose included 1,834 frontline workers, 1,022 healthcare workers and 14,253 individuals above 60 years. The number of healthcare workers and frontline workers is far lower because they are getting the vaccine for a long time. The vaccination began in January with healthcare workers and since the first week of February, frontline workers have been getting the shots. Several centres reported that the turnout was lower on Friday. “The turnout may be lower because of Friday being a holiday. We hope that more people will turn out on Saturday because it is the weekend,” said a source at Lok Nayak Hospital. The government has allowed vaccination at all centres on all days, including Sundays and gazetted holidays throughout April, with an aim to optimally utilise all vaccination centers in public and private sectors to ensure rapid increase in pace and coverage of Covid vaccination. No major glitches were reported at the vaccination centres in verification. Many beneficiaries said the registration through the Co-WIN portal was smooth. However, many reported problems in scheduling appointments. The vaccination was carried out at nearly 600 vaccination centres spread across 192 private and government hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/walk-ins-outnumber-registered-users-at-some-places-as-52k-take-covid-shots/articleshow/81878670.cms||AlokKNMishra

Petitioning the Karur district collector on Friday, coordinators of the movement, N Shanmugam, K Vijayan and Mukilan, said the minister was spreading lies. Vijayabhaskar has said the state environment impact assessment authority (SEIAA) had given permission for 15,000-odd bullock kart owners to take sand from four places in Cauvery river. He was responding to the claims of DMK candidate V Senthil Balaji that bullock kart owners will be allowed to take sand from Cauvery. Irregularities in mining river sand had led the Madras high court to direct the state government to close all sand quarries operating in Cauvery and Kollidam rivers in 2017. While the ban has affected 15,000-odd bullock kart owners, they ha sought permission to take river sand. Senthil Balaji had promised bullock kart owners that DMK would take steps to allow them to take river sand once they come to power. Countering him Vijayabhaskar said that Balaji wants to take credit for an issue solved by the AIADMK government. “Vijayabhaskar claimed that SEIAA has given its nod and four places have been identified for bullock kart owners to take river sand based on an official document. However, the official documents neither had date nor signature,” said Mukilan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/action-sought-against-min-for-false-claims-on-sand-mining/articleshow/81878659.cms||---

Speaking at the inauguration of a flyover in Lucknow, the CM said that interstate roads and roads connecting district headquarters were being expanded to four lane, while tehsil and block headquarters were being connected with two lane roads. Five expressways are under construction. Despite its limited finances, he said the state government took several crucial decisions about the construction of national highways. For that, it has stopped imposing royalty on earth for construction and supervision charges for utility shifting have been reduced from 15% to 5%. “The number of highways and their length have both gone up. I thank road transport and highway minister Nitin Gadkari for the greenfield express highway between Lucknow and Kanpur, which will bring down travel time by half. The Outer Ring Road in Lucknow is also being constructed at a fast pace and will become the lifeline for the city,” the CM said. He also thanked defence minister Rajnath Singh for a DRDO centre in Lucknow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-thanks-pm-for-giving-pace-to-infra-development/articleshow/81878663.cms||---

When the infant’s family members pointed out the mistake, the doctors rectified their mistake and plastered her right hand. On Thursday, Suman Devi, a resident of Goiritola area in Ramgarh, took her daughter to Kalawati Orthopaedic Hospital here after her X-ray report revealed that the she had suffered a fracture in her right hand. “On Thursday afternoon, my daughter fell from her bed and began wailing, following which I took her to a local X-ray clinic. The X-ray report showed that her right hand was broken. I then took her to the hospital in the evening for getting her hand plastered,” Suman said. She added that the doctors there performed another X-ray which confirmed the fracture. “They charged us Rs 5,000 for the plaster and Rs 500 as doctor’s fee. But they plastered the wrong hand,” she said. When Suman and her family members noticed the plaster on the wrong hand, they pointed it out to the on-duty staff and protested. The plaster was then removed from her right hand and her left hand was plastered. Dr Dinesh Kumar, who owns the hospital, however, blamed the child for their mistake. He said, “The mistake took place because the child changed her position moments before hand was to be plastered. The mistake was, however, rectified immediately.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/docs-plaster-wrong-hand-of-infant-brought-in-with-fracture/articleshow/81877461.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Other staff and students, who came in contact with the infected teacher, were asked to get themselves tested immediately. The administration also said random tests of teachers and students of schools in the district will start immediately. While Loyola School principal, Fr Pius, was not available for a comment, a Class VIII student said, "We are asked to stay home until further notice." Earlier on Thursday, the district health officials sealed DBMS English School and Andhra Association English School (AAES), both located in the Kadma area, after two Class IX students of DBMS and a Class X teacher of AAES tested positive. Sources said all three schools are likely to be reopened on Monday after the sanitization process is over. Joint chairman of DBMS Group, B Chandrashekar, said the school management has advised its teachers aged 45 and above to get themselves vaccinated soon. AAES sources said the infected teacher is undergoing treatment at the Tata Main Hospital. Confirming the shutdown of the schools, additional chief medical officer Dr Sahir Pall said orders for the closure have been issued to the district education department to ensure that the students and the teachers produced negative test reports before reopening the schools. Additional district magistrate Nand Kishore Lal said random checking of students and teachers in Steel City schools will begin to check the spread of the virus. Reacting to the news about the surge in Covid cases and the rising infection among school students and teachers, Jamshedpur Abhivavak Sangh convener Umesh Kumar said, "In the wake of the abrupt increase in Covid-19, the district administration should not permit physical classes in schools. Right now, online classes are the best way to avert the risk of getting infected." Notably, physical classes for new academic sessions for Class III to XII in all private English schools in the city started last week. Meanwhile, 152 train passengers alighting at the Tatanagar station and from Mumbai, Ahmedabad and Delhi were tested. In another special drive led by SP (city) Subash Chandra Jat, 80 people without wearing masks at the Kadma market area were also tested. Sources said such drives would be conducted across the city to ensure that people follow the Covid safety protocols.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/3-jsr-schools-sealed-after-students-teachers-test-ve/articleshow/81876851.cms||B Sridhar

As part of the drive, a Covid-19 vaccination centre (CVC) will be set up in every panchayat. The department plans to organise the first phase of the special drive on April 4 and 5, the second phase on April 7 and 8, the third phase on April 10 and 11 and the fourth phase will be organised on April 13 and 14. In a letter circulated among all the 24 DCs on Thursday, health secretary K K Soan directed them to complete all the required arrangements before the special drive begins. The letter has also directed them to ensure maximum coverage on April 7 which is World Health Day. Soan has asked them to mobilize self-help group members in identifying and tagging the beneficiaries to their respective session sites. He also suggested involving the public sector undertakings (PSUs), private establishments and non-government organizations (NGOs) in the drive for maximum participation. According to a senior health department official, NGOs and PSUs will be roped in to assist the district administrations in ferrying the elderly and those who are unable to travel to session sites located far away from their homes, thus leading to a low turnout. Dr Ajit Prasad, the state nodal officer for the vaccination drive, said, “Around 3,400 session sites are functional at the moment and that number will go up before the special drive commences.” Asked how they are going to transport vaccines to CVCs located in areas which are not easily accessible, Dr Prasad said cold chain points have been assigned to every district and each CVC will be provided with vaccine carriers which can hold the vials for 12 hours. “The vials will be dispatched to each centre in an ice pack conditioned insulated vaccine carrier which has a hold-over time of more than 12 hours,” he added. The health department has asked all the DCs to raise awareness in rural areas regarding the special drive and publicise the location of the CVCs at least three days prior to its launch. The block-level officials, in co-ordination with the welfare department, have been asked to carry out the IEC activities and help out the elderly beneficiaries in taking the shot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/panchayats-to-have-spl-vax-centres-to-boost-coverage-of-people-aged-45-above/articleshow/81876981.cms||Gaurav Pandey

Indian Red Cross Society’s secretary (Jamshedpur unit) Vijay Singh told TOI, “We have requested our old donors for plasma donation provided their anti-body levels enable them for donation.” He added that PDAC is reaching out to 300 donors and undertaking awareness campaigns across various media platforms. Till date, PDAC has collected plasma from 235 people and nearly 35% of those donors were from rural areas. They were deemed fit for plasma donation after PDAC screened 1,100 people shortly after they recovered from Covid-19. “The criterion for selecting candidates for plasma donation is so complex that only a handful of the recovered people are eligible for donation,” Singh said. As per the protocols set by the healthcare experts, only those between 18-59 years with no underlying ailments are eligible for plasma donation 21 days after they have recovered from the infection. During June-July last year when pandemic was at its peak in the district, PDAC received as many as 20 requests for plasma donation daily. The committee collects plasma at the Jamshedpur Blood Bank and caters to hospitals in and around Steel City. So far, PDAC has supplied plasma to Tata Main Hospital, Tata Motors Hospital, Brahmananda Narayana Multispecialty Hospital. In addition, PDAC has supplied plasma to Bhagwan Mahavir Medica Superspecialty Hospital and Abdul Razaak Ansari Memorial Hospital in Ranchi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/amid-spike-in-cases-east-sbhum-admin-launches-campaign-for-plasma-donation/articleshow/81876929.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Major Shrivijay Morla, who is involved in the recruitment process, lodged a complaint of forgery and counterfeiting at City B Division police station on Thursday. According to the complaint, unidentified persons issued fake admit cards to the candidates who were not eligible for the physical test. The test is being held by Indian Army for hiring personnel for the posts of soldier, general duty, tradesman, nursing assistant, clerk and technician. The complaining officer informed the police that 2,119 candidates were eligible for the test, to be held on April 25, and their admit cards were issued in person. On March 18, it came to notice that two fake admit cards were being circulated on WhatsApp. When the army officials verified the fake admit cards, it was found that the two cards were issued ineligible candidates. One of the candidates, Dinesh Vadel was eliminated from the recruitment process as he had failed during the ground examination held earlier. The other candidate, Akash Vaja, did not even appear during the ground examination. “Fake admit cards in circulation seemed genuine as it had the stamp of the recruitment board,” said SI, S V Ramani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/fake-admit-cards-issued-to-two-ineligible-candidates/articleshow/81877650.cms||---

Aditya Ranjan, the director cum joint secretary of the state rural development department, wrote a letter to all 24 deputy commissioners of the state informing them about the hike. In the letter, Ranjan directed the DCs to pay MGNREGS workers the revised rate. Until March 31, MGNREGS workers in the state were paid Rs 194 per man day as per the rate fixed. On March 31, the Centre revised the wage to Rs 198 per man day. A statement issued by chief minister Hemant Soren’s office said the state government had suggested a further increase in the wages. “As the Union government did not take a positive step in this regard, the state government has decided to hike the wages to Rs 225. The additional cost will be borne by the state,” the statement read. In the recently-concluded Budget session of the Jharkhand Assembly, Hemant had claimed that the Centre was reluctant to hike the MGNREGS wages. “While the Union government has been trying to make the scheme ineffective by drying up money, we have revived it during the lockdown. We can proudly say that so far, the Jharkhand government has created 10 lakh man days since migrant workers returned to the state, which is itself a record,” Hemant had said in the Assembly. With migrants returning to their homes during the peak of the pandemic last year, the state government had rolled out three rural schemes under MGREGS to generate employment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jharkhand-hikes-nrega-wage-workers-to-get-rs-27-more-than-central-rate/articleshow/81877439.cms||Dhritiman Ray

We remain focused towards optimising value through such strategic exits and are equally committed to raise resources to capitalise on the current and upcoming primary and secondary market opportunities in the highway sector.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/brnl-inks-deal-with-cube-highways/articleshow/81878026.cms||---

Vivekananda Reddy, uncle of chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy and younger brother of the late Y S Rajasekhar Reddy, was found murdered in his house at Pulivendula on March 15, 2019. The case was handed over to the CBI by the state government. Sunitha Reddy told media persons that the CBI had not found the facts and people behind her father’s murder even after one year. She termed her father’s murder a political act and demanded that those who committed the crime and those who are behind it be punished. She said that several persons have advised her to give up pursuing the case. She, however, said she wants the culprits to be punished. She regretted that the case was not moving forward. Sunitha Reddy said some witnesses in the case died last year and wanted the CBI to complete the investigation fast. “I want justice without further delay. I want the culprits to be punished,” she said. She expressed confidence that her cousin Y S Sharmila would support her in the case. “Sharmila knows some facts. I expect her to support me in getting the guilty punished,” Sunitha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vivekas-daughter-meets-cbi-officials-in-new-delhi/articleshow/81876366.cms||---

Though Nair had not spoken openly in favour of any particular front in this election, the statements he has made over the last one month signal that the organisation is leaning towards UDF. What seems to have worked in UDF’s favour is its decision to support the NSS stand on Sabarimala. As for BJP, NSS had earlier expressed its displeasure with the party pointing out that as it was in power at the Centre, it could have made appropriate legislation on the matter. Nair said, “If CPM was sincere about changing its stand on the Sabarimala issue, we could have comprehended their moves. It is trying to fool the people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/kerala/nairs-may-tilt-towards-udf-rethink-policy-of-equidistance/articleshow/81880586.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair
---||Vijayawada||Petitions in High court seek direction to start election process afresh||VIJAYAWADA: House motion petitions were moved in the high court on Friday seeking directions to the state election commission to start the MPTC and ZPTC election process afresh. The petitions were filed by BJP’s state general secretary Pathuri Nagabhushanam and three intending contestants seeking urgent hearing, as the notification for resumption of the stalled poll process has already been issued by the SEC. Arguing on behalf of the petitioners, senior counsel P Veera Reddy said the SEC does not have the powers to postpone the elections indefinitely. The earlier elections were postponed for a period of six weeks or till the pandemic situation recedes, whichever was earlier. By not going for fresh notification even after a year, many aspiring candidates who became eligible for contesting the elections are being denied their right to contest, Reddy said. He added that as per Rule 7 of Panchayat Raj Act, the SEC has the power to issue a fresh notification under exceptional circumstances, and the present situation is a fit case to be considered as one. He further stated that the Supreme Court, in its judgement, did not speak about resumption of elections from where they were stopped. The apex court confined to the subject matter of postponement of elections only. Resuming elections from where they were stopped by citing the SC judgement is not a valid reason as the judgement itself is silent on resumption of elections except that there should be a post decisional consultation between the government and the SEC, Reddy said. Senior counsel CV Mohan Reddy, representing the SEC, sought time to file counters in the petitions. Considering his request and also the urgency of the matter, Justice U Durga Prasad Rao directed him to file counters by Saturday morning. The matter will be taken up for hearing in the afternoon session.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/petitions-in-hc-seek-direction-to-start-election-process-afresh/articleshow/81876388.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Vijayawada||State Election Commission Sawhney seeks all-party support||VIJAYAWADA: The State Election Commission (SEC) on Friday sought the support of all political parties on the successful completion of the mandal parishad and zilla parishad elections. SEC Nilam Sawhney held an all-party meeting in her office and made the appeal. The opposition TDP, BJP and Jana Sena boycotted the meeting, while Congress walked out of the meeting after registering its protest. The parties alleged that the parishad elections held in March 2020 were undemocratic and in violation of the election norms. The parties also sought to remind the new SEC that they have already given their representations seeking cancellation of the entire process and issue fresh notification. They took exception to the unanimous elections held in the past and demanded that the SEC cancel them all. However, the SEC had resumed the election process, which was paused after the withdrawal of nominations. “The election process was stopped after the withdrawals were completed and the valid nominations were declared wherever elections were necessary. We have now resumed that and not going back into the process that was conducted by the previous SEC,” Nilam Sawhney told the representatives of the political parties. She directed the district collectors and the SPs to make necessary arrangements for the campaign of the candidates and polling on April 8. She said that re-polling would be held on April 9 if required and wanted the political parties to coordinate with the returning officers and the police personnel during the course of election campaign.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/sec-sawhney-seeks-all-party-support/articleshow/81876399.cms||Gopi Dara
---||---||Day after second phase, TMC, BJP complain to EC||KOLKATA: A day after polling in the second phase of Bengal polls, both Trinamool and BJP moved the Election Commission on Friday with their complaints. A Trinamool delegation, which met chief electoral officer (CEO) Ariz Aftab, complained that the party has filed around 300 complaints with the EC against BJP supporters and “stooges” for threatening and intimidating voters. The party also alleged that in some cases, the voters are not being allowed to cast their votes and in some other cases, they are being forced to vote for BJP. TMC also complained on the role of central forces. “We have told the poll panel that the role of central forces has been partial in many booths in the first two phases. There have been incidents of violence and attacks on our party supporters by BJP. We have asked the EC to see to it that this is not repeated in the next six phases,” Yashwant Sinha, who was part of the delegation, said. The delegation also told EC that the party has reported 326 complaints about “faulty EVMs” in phases I and II. The party said in several cases, EVMs developed a snag after votes had been cast and those votes were lost because of the snag. The Bengal BJP lodged a complaint with the EC against Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee for sitting inside a Nandigram booth on Thursday to “influence” voters. Shishir Bajoria, spokesperson of Bengal BJP, said: “The chief minister can surely visit a booth as a candidate. But she reached this particular booth and stayed inside for a prolonged period. This violates the model code of conduct and Representation of Peoples Act. Her presence also caused escalation of tension in nearby areas.”  “Yesterday, she herself went out and started fomenting trouble. This does not suit her as the chief minister and as a candidate,” said Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/day-after-second-phase-tmc-bjp-complain-to-ec/articleshow/81880590.cms||---
---||---||2 Sujits & Sabyasachis pitted against a lesser-known Abhisek||KOLKATA: It’s all about Dutta vs Dutta and Bose vs Bose, along with an Abhisek Banerjee (not Mamata Banerjee’s nephew) at West Bengal’s Bidhannagar assembly segment that will go to the polls on April 17. While sitting Trinamool MLA and fire services minister Sujit Bose and former Trinamool heavyweight-turned-BJP leader Sabyasachi Dutta are key contenders, two independent candidates who are namesakes of Bose and Dutta are also in the fray. There is also Congress candidate Abhisek Banerjee, a lawyer. It’s definitely not a unique coincidence but a ploy often used by parties to grab votes of opponents. However, Bidhannagar is the first such example of use of dummy candidates against popular leaders this election. Lake Town resident and neighbour of minister Bose, 58-year-old marketing consultant Sabyasachi Dutta is an Independent candidate who claims to have played with the original Dutta and the minister in their youth. “It is just a coincidence that I share the same name as the former mayor. It was my childhood dream to contest an election. I retired from a corporate job two years ago and now I want to serve people of my area,” said Dutta, who said he was an active SFI worker in college and later became a Trinamool sympathizer. He said he won’t be campaigning like his namesake. “I don’t have so much money. I have some friends who are campaigning for other leaders in the area and they will do a whisper campaign for me,” he said. The other dummy candidate, 58-year-old Barasat resident Sujit Bose, did not respond to TOI’s queries. Political analysts said fielding candidates with similar names is a “negative strategy” used by rival parties to create confusion so that votes for a candidate from an established political party get divided. In a closely-fought election, such a strategy often becomes very effective. However, both minister Bose and Trinamool turncoat Dutta said they were not bothered about the dummy candidates. “They can field a 100 Sabyasachi Duttas, but people in this area know the real Sabyasachi and will vote for me,” said the former Bidhannagar mayor, clarifying that he doesn’t know any of the two namesakes. Two-time MLA Bose also said he is not bothered about the proxy candidates. “There are others to worry about, including a criminal who now works for BJP and has registered himself as a candidate for this seat,” he said. At Bidhannagar, nine candidates are participating, including Congress’s Abhisek Banerjee. “I realise I have a namesake in MP Abhishek Banerjee. My academics and the person I am have helped me establish my own identity. I do not need to write ‘nephew’ before my name,” said Banerjee, a 39-year-old data architect with a multinational software development concern.

---||---||Amit Shah promises adivasi status to 11 Gorkha communities||TALCHINI/ SITALKUCHI: The BJP government is working on granting adivasi status to 11 Gorkha communities, Union home minister Amit Shah announced on Friday during his north Bengal tour. The Gorkhas have for long been demanding adivasi status for multiple communities, including Gurung, Bhujel, Mangar, Newar, Jogi, Khas, Rai, Sunwar, Thami, Yakkha and Dhimal. Shah’s announcement was aimed at countering Gorkha leader Bimal Gurung ahead of polls in three seats in the Hills and five seats in the foothills, where Gorkhas have a presence. Shah, who also assured land pattas to 3.5 lakh tea garden workers in the Dooars, said the BJP government would hand over the deeds by November; his announcement was an attempt to trump a similar promise from West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. He also hinted at a wage revision for tea garden workers. “The wage in tea gardens stood at Rs 176 in 2017. We have plans to take it to Rs 350,” Shah said, adding Prime Minister Narendra Modi had allocated Rs 1,000 crore for the welfare of tea grower families. The Union home minister also lined up a number of development projects for north Bengal: an AIIMS and a central university in Cooch Behar, Rs 10,000 crore support to improve health infrastructure, an annual Rs 2,000 crore fund for development and Rs 500 crore for the Cooch Behar Ras Mela. “This place is 700 km from Kolkata. But for Mamata Didi, the place is over 7,000 km away. North Bengal has been discriminated against. That is why Didi is afraid of the people in north Bengal. We are going to win 50 out of the 60 seats that went to polls in the first two phases. But in north Bengal, we expect all the 50-odd seats. North Bengal will get topmost priority the day BJP comes to office in Bengal,” Shah said. At Sitalkuchi in Cooch Behar — home to refugees from East Pakistan and Bangladesh — the Union home minister reiterated the BJP government’s resolve to “honour” the refugees with citizenship. At the same time, he talked tough on infiltrators. “Do you endorse infiltration? Infiltrators are taking away the job opportunities of the youth and eating the rations of the poor. Do you believe Mamata Didi can stop infiltration? Give BJP a chance in Bengal. I can assure you, we will stop infiltration,” Shah said. He then shifted focus to Coach Behar’s Rajbanshis, who form a majority in the district. Shah told the gathering that a BJP government would raise the Narayani Sena battalion in the Army with Rajbanshi youths. Shah added that BJP would punish those who had tortured Rajbanshis under the Trinamool government. “After assuming office on May 2, the BJP government will start the process of putting tormentors, coal mafias, sand mafias and cattle smugglers behind bars,” Shah said. Taking on the Bengal CM, Shah said, “I come to hear Trinamool slogans ‘khela hobe, khela hobe’. The people of Bengal are no longer scared of ‘khela hobe’. Instead, mothers and sisters in places chased away Trinamool workers. BJP workers are now ready to take on the Trinamool.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/amit-shah-promises-adivasi-status-to-11-gorkha-communities/articleshow/81880608.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya

In Diamond Harbour’s Haridebpur village, BJP candidate Dipak Halder was injured and his car damaged by a group of men while he was campaigning on Friday morning. Halder, a sitting MLA who switched to BJP a few months ago, was allegedly roughed up by locals and taken to hospital with chest pain. His supporters were allegedly attacked with sticks and poles. “It’s a planned attack by TMC. The incident showed the real face of the party,” he told TOI from his bed at Diamond Harbour Medical College. BJP supporters blocked the road and burnt tyres, but police removed them to make way for an Abhishek Banerjee rally. BJP later lodged a complaint with the EC. TMC claimed the attack was a result of infighting as BJP old-timers were unhappy with Halder’s candidature, and claimed that he was faking the injury. At least 12 people, including a former councillor and CIC member, were injured after a TMC-BJP clash in Barasat’s Maldweep area over putting up party posters on Thursday night. In Belgharia’s Ranipark, four persons were injured amid another TMC-BJP clash. In West Mindapore’s Keshpur, TMC supporters blocked the road for two hours with the body of Uttam Dolui, who was murdered hours before Wednesday’s polls. A BJP worker was hurt and his house allegedly damaged by TMC workers in Goalshini, Chandrakona.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/diamond-harbour-mla-bjp-nominee-attacked/articleshow/81880609.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty

BJP members in the state said DMK has resorted to such a campaign to create a “fake anti-Modi wave”. It all started after Modi campaigned for state BJP chief L Murugan in Dharapuram (reserved) constituency in Tiruppur on April 30. DMK candidate for Thondamuthur, Karthikeya Sivasenapathy, requested Modi to campaign for minister S P Velumani in the constituency. He tweeted that the PM’s campaign “will be useful” for him and tagged the PM’s official handle. It went viral. Several other DMK candidates then made similar appeals to the PM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/tamil-nadu/canvass-for-our-rivals-ensure-we-win-dmk-netas-dig-at-pm/articleshow/81880611.cms||---

---||---||Election Commission ends Himanta Biswa Sarma's campaign 48 hours early||NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Friday barred BJP leader and its ‘star campaigner’ in Assam Himanta Biswa Sarma from campaigning for 48 hours over his alleged threat to the chairman of Bodoland People’s Front, a Congress alliance partner in the state. The 48-hour ban effectively means that Sarma will not be able to campaign any more in Assam as the ban shall remain in force till Sunday evening, by when campaigning for the last phase of polling in the state would have ended. Finding Sarma’s threat to BPF chief Hagrama Mohilary that he would be arrested by central investigation agency NIA to be prima facie a violation of the model code of conduct, the EC said it strongly condemned his impugned statement. Though Sarma, in his reply to the EC notice served on him on Thursday, denied allegations that he had threatened Mohilary and also tried to influence voters not to vote for the Congress alliance, the EC did not find the explanation satisfactory. Accordingly, the EC barred him from holding any public meetings, public processions, rallies, road shows or giving media interviews for 48 hours with immediate effect from April 2. The model code requires criticism of political parties to be limited to their policies and programmes and not extend to aspects of private life of their leaders. Also, it provides that “all parties and candidates shall avoid scrupulously all activities which are corrupt practices and offences under the election law”, including bribing and intimidation of voters. As per the full transcript of Sarma’s statement, received from the Assam chief electoral officer, he had said, “If Hagrama does extremism with Batha, he will go to jail. If Hagrama encourages Batha, he will go to jail. Already got lot of evidence, the case is being given to NIA. The recovery of arms at Kokrajhar in a car, that case is being given to NIA. Nobody will be allowed to do unrest in BTR, even if he is Hagrama or anyone. This will not be tolerated. We are not afraid of Batha. I am making it clear. There will be no bomb in BTR, there will be no firearms in BTR. These arms recovery cases will be counted one by one after the election. We will not allow unrest in Bodoland, this is being enquired by the NIA.” Watch Assam polls: EC bars Himanta Biswa Sarma from campaigning for 48 hours||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/assam/election-commission-ends-himanta-biswa-sarmas-campaign-48-hours-early/articleshow/81880620.cms||---
---||Goa||Temples, restaurants, casinos to face action if caught flouting Covid norms||PANAJI: The North Goa district collectorate on Friday warned of strong action against commercial establishments, such as hotels, restaurants, casinos and managements of religious bodies, if found not following the mandatory Covid-19 protocol.An establishment will be shut for three to four days if Covid-19 cases are detected in the premises, and its licence will be withdrawn if it is found that SOPs continue to be flouted. “We request all establishments to strictly adhere to Covid SOPs. In the first instance, we will shut the establishment if more cases are found there. If the situation is not brought under control, the establishment’s licence will be revoked,” deputy collector Gurudas Desai said while addressing reporters. He said these decisions were taken at a meeting held by the disaster management committee on Friday morning. Ironically, the press conference was held in a packed hall at the collectorate office in Panaji, where it was not possible to follow social distancing. Last week, after 31 employees of an offshore casino tested positive, the North Goa district administration declared a residential complex in Porvorim in which the casino staffers were staying as a micro containment zone. Two days prior to this development, a popular restaurant in Panaji was sealed after a few coronavirus cases were reported there. “The managements of malls, casinos, hotels and restaurants must implement the prescribed measures in order to stop the spread of the virus. Revenue and police officials will pay surprise visits. An establishment found not following the SOPs will be sealed,” Desai said. The deputy collector also stated that all establishments, such as casinos, units in industrial estates, hotels, etc, should send their staff for Covid testing as soon as they return from other states. “The railway authorities have also been asked to carry out thermal screening, and district administration officials will conduct inspections to check whether protocols are being followed,” Desai said. “The collector has said that if they (railways authorities) are not following SOPs, their functioning can be stopped,” he said. With regards to religious institutes, he said in view of festivities such as Iid, Ramnavmi, Hanuman Jayanti, when most temples conduct programmes, the managements should make sure that protocols are followed. “We will be forced to close temples which fails to follow Covid protocol,” the deputy collector warned. “As of now, the government is not going for lockdown but measures in place need to be implemented and followed as cases are growing,” Desai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/temples-restaurants-casinos-to-face-action-if-caught-flouting-covid-norms/articleshow/81878155.cms||---

In an unprecedented gesture, Modi began his speech in Konni in Pathanamthitta district by invoking Lord Ayyappa and chanting ‘Swamiye Saranam Ayyappa’ loudly and clearly thrice and exhorting his audience to follow suit. The PM also paid homage to Jesus Christ on the occasion of Good Friday, saying we “remember his service and sacrifice”. Launching a broadside at both LDF and UDF, Modi called the fronts ‘twins’ and, alluding to the Bible, said both of them are guilty of “seven deadly sins”. The PM appealed to voters to give NDA an opportunity to form the government and promised to build a Kerala that they dream of. He said Congress and CPM were getting closer in Bengal after every  and a logical step after such proximity would be a full merger. CPM politburo member M A Baby slammed Modi for chanting ‘Saranam Ayyappa’ at Konni, saying that the PM was violating the secular values followed by past PMs of India. Speaking at an election convention at Karunagappally in Kollam, Baby said ‘Swamiye Saranam Ayyappa’ can be chanted at Sabarimala or at a place of worship but it is not right to chant it at a public meeting, that too at an election rally. CPM and UDF will be, willy-nilly, forced to confront the Sabarimala issue in at least a few south and central Kerala districts where the issue and its aftermath remain fresh in public memory. In Thiruvananthapuram later in the evening, Modi, without naming devaswom minister K Surendran, said a minister from the city whose role was to support temples had worked as a “mastermind” to shower lathis on devotees in Sabarimala. He said local MLAs of UDF and LDF were facing serious charges such as amassment of disproportionate assets, disrespect towards women and destruction of public properties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/kerala/days-before-election-pm-modi-puts-focus-back-on-sabarimala/articleshow/81880630.cms||---

Altogether 1,334 of those admitted have been discharged following treatment as on Friday, while the rest were shifted either to Goa Medical College and Hospital or to a Covid care centre, show records. Of the altogether 3 patients who died in the hospital during the period, two breathed their last in the casualty ward before being admitted. Four wards of the South Goa district hospital are currently being utilised for treating Covid patients. But with an upsurge in cases, plans are afoot to upgrade the facility by opening more wards, a decision about which is likely to be taken by the state health department soon. “The facilities are likely to be spruced up further. Contingency plans are also being worked out,” a senior medical officer said. Sources at the district hospital said that 112 beds of the total 170 are currently occupied, and that seven patients are undergoing treatment in the hospital’s ICU. Three among those admitted in the hospital are pregnant women. “The severity is less this time, possibly due to the fact that the patients are receiving the right kind of treatment at the right time as doctors have acquired the proficiency to deal with all types of Covid-19 cases over the last one year,” a senior doctor at the hospital told TOI. He, however, said that it was too early to predict how the situation would unfold.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/south-district-hospital-to-be-upgraded-to-deal-with-spike/articleshow/81878161.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

Victim Premlata Sharma registered a complaint against the accused at Gorwa police station on Thursday night.  Sharma told police she had come in touch with one of the accused, Bhumi Pathak some months ago. Pathak, who is a make-up artist, told Sharma that she can get her 12-year-old daughter role in Hindi films. Pathak asked Sharma to bring her daughter for a beauty contest at a studio in the city.  Sharma was told that if her daughter gets selected, she will get a role in a serial. Pathak then demanded Rs 50,000 from Sharma for getting a role for her daughter in a Hindi movie. Sharma transferred Rs 49,000 to Pathak but nothing happened later. Sharma then went to Mumbai where Pathak introduced her to another Subodh Kumar who claimed to be a serials director.  Kumar took Rs 3 lakh from Sharma for giving a break to her daughter. But when Sharma’s daughter didn’t get any role, she filed a complaint of cheating worth Rs 3.52 lakh at Gorwa police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/lured-by-bwood-woman-cheated/articleshow/81877526.cms||---

On day one, at the Chicalim sub-district hospital, 115 people received the shot while 112 were vaccinated on day two. The hospital’s medical superintendent, Dr Anil Umraskar said that the drive is on at four places in Vasco, including two private hospitals, one in Chicalim and one in Vasco. The government’s free vaccination is being undertaken at the Ravindra Bhavan, Baina, and the Chicalim sub-district hospital. The staff of the Vasco urban health centre are in charge of the drive at Ravindra Bhavan. “People are free to choose where they want to take the vaccine as it is the same everywhere,” Umraskar said. On Thursday, the first day of the vaccination drive for the 45-59 age group, the sub-district hospital vaccinated 173 of whom 115 were in the target age group while the remaining comprised senior citizens and healthcare workers. On Friday, 154 people received the shot of which 112 were in the 45-59 age group while the rest were senior citizens and healthcare workers. “The number of senior citizens taking the vaccine is fluctuating.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Seven years on, 65-year-old cleared of sexual abuse of child||MUMBAI: Seven years after a 65-year-old chairman of a suburban highrise was arrested on charges of sexually assaulting a 5-year-old from the complex and spent three months in jail, a special Pocso Act court has acquitted him observing that his claim of having been falsely implicated over a parking row with her parents could not be ruled out. The court also took objection to the parents' refusal to let the child depose. "There is no direct evidence against the accused to connect him with the offence on the girl. Had there been an element of truth, the parents would not have prevented the recording of her evidence. The prosecution has failed to give cogent, trustworthy proof against the accused," it said. The parents claimed she had forgotten the incident, but the court said a child would not forget such an incident easily. Mother’s duty to allow direct proof come on record: CourtThe child will forget other facts, but not bad touch to private parts which has caused shame and outraged her modesty,” the court said. It further observed that any educated person who believes in truth and the law will ensure that justice is done and not prevent a child from deposing. “Being an educated mother with sound background, it was the duty of the complainant to allow direct and substantive evidence to come on record so that in the interest of children, the wrongdoer can be punished. Care is taken in Pocso Act to protect the child.” In fact, the mother had even given a fake address in court, later revealing that she did not want her address in the court records. The 65-year-old told the court that the case had ruined his senior years, having spent around three months in jail in 2014 before he was granted bail. The child and her parents have since moved out of the building. The parents had alleged that the incident took place on January 26, 2014, when the child had gone to play with the accused’s granddaughter. It was alleged that at 6pm, when the girl’s father went to fetch her to take her for a birthday party, she refused as her friend had just woken up from a nap and she wanted to play with her. The parents alleged that when they asked their daughter what she was doing alone for the last half an hour, she said the 65-year-old had sexually assaulted her. The child was then taken to the birthday party, and the following day the mother went to police. However, the senior citizen’s son, in his deposition as a defence witness, submitted that on the day of the incident, between 5.30pm and 6.30pm, all the family members were in the living room having snacks. He alleged that the girl’s father came to their flat and complained about garbage being thrown on his car in the parking lot. The son said there was also an exchange of words.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-seven-years-on-65-year-old-cleared-of-sexual-abuse-of-child/articleshow/81880655.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Delhi||Bail for several Delhi riots accused due to doubts over witnesses||NEW DELHI: In most of the successful bail pleas made by people accused of involvement in the northeast Delhi riots of February 2020, lingering doubts about the identification of the accused proved to be the clinchers. Of the 28 bail orders issued in March, which are available on the website of Delhi district courts, in several cases, the courts weren’t sure about the credibility of the statements of the public and the police witnesses. The lack of electronic evidence didn’t help the police case either. The bail orders say the statements of the police witnesses can’t be relied upon, thus creating an uncertainty about the identifications. Lack of electronic proof, absence of specific roles lead to bail in riot casesIn one case, State Vs Suhail, the court observed that the identification of the accused by the police beat officers was “hardly of any consequence”. The court expressed its inability to comprehend why the officers had waited till the recording of statements under Section 161 of CrPC (examination of witnesses by police) to name the bail applicant when they claimed they had seen him rioting and identified him. “Being police officers, what stopped them from reporting the matter then and there in the police station or to bring the same to the knowledge of higher officers is beyond comprehension. This casts a serious doubt on the credibility of the aforesaid police witnesses,” the bail order noted. Other orders have similar observations. The defence counsel in such cases had raised the point of “planted witnesses”, who allegedly witnessed the accused engaged in violence but did not report it immediately. The counsel of Shariq, 26, accused of involvement in the murder of three persons, stressed on the eight-month delay between filing of the FIR and his client’s arrest. He pointed out that Shariq lived in the vicinity of the alleged incident, contrary to the prosecution’s contention that his presence was established by the mobile location at the time and place of the incident. Granting him bail, the court agreed that Shariq lived near the scene of crime and his presence there was, therefore, only natural. In State Vs Shahnawaz, advocate Dinesh Tiwari similarly argued that an eyewitness identified his client while recording his statement almost two months after the incident. Tiwari also accused the two police witnesses of being “planted witnesses” for not having reported the incident when it occurred. The bail order noted the “delay of about 46 days” in recording the statement of the witnesses without a “plausible/cogent explanation in this regard from the prosecution for this humongous delay”. The bail order also recorded the fact that there was no electronic evidence in the form of CCTV footage/video clip or CDR (call data record). Beside focusing on the dodgy identification arguments, the defence lawyers also leveraged the absence of specific roles attributed to the accused individuals by the prosecution and the delay in lodging of FIRs. They also highlighted the absence of electronic evidence, either in the form of CCTV footage or CDR. In State Vs Sachin Rastogi, the order stated that the bail applicant had neither been named in the FIR, nor was there any CCTV footage or video clip of the incident involving the petitioner available on record. Tiwari and his team have filed 152 bail applications in the riot cases, securing bail in 79 till now, including 15 granted by Delhi High Court. “The primary reason for granting bail is the delay in recording of statements by public witnesses, which in turn delays the disclosure of the accused’s identity. Lack of video footage is also a crucial ground in these cases.” “Prima facie, evidence in terms of witness statements, or the lack of them, is crucial to the bail process. Unreliable statements are grounds for bail in most such cases,” said advocate Seema Mishra. The court orders, however, clarify that the observations are not to be construed as expressing an opinion about the merit of the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bail-for-several-delhi-riots-accused-due-to-doubts-over-witnesses/articleshow/81880661.cms||Aamir Khan

We have noted that Opec and Opec Plus have announced last week a slight easing of crude production cuts, even though it is still far below the originally announced schedule of cuts,” MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said. The Opec plays a key role in policy formulations relating to crude production. The Opec Plus comprises the Opec countries, Russia and several other producers. “India has been appealing to crude oil producing countries since the beginning of the year to ease crude oil production cuts announced last year,” Bagchi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ease-crude-oil-production-cuts-india-tells-opec/articleshow/81880676.cms||---

Wearing blue clothes, or using the colour as a theme, several people across the state participated in the awareness campaign. TOI had earlier reported that the Sethu Centre for Child Development and Family Guidance, Goa, had called on people to participate in the campaign by changing the external lighting of their home to the colour blue, planning a simple team-building exercise around the colour, making a blue drink or creating anything that has the colour in it. While most of the participants opted to wear the colour and shared a selfie tagging Sethu in their social media posts, some users made use of the festive season and shared blue-coloured Easter eggs or used the pristine waters of Goa’s coastline as a blue backdrop to share their picture in support of the autism awareness campaign.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-lights-it-up-blue-marks-autism-day/articleshow/81878542.cms||---
---||India||Urdu council bid to promote Bhagwat book triggers row||MUMBAI: National Council for Promotion of Urdu Language (NCPUL) director Shaikh Aqeel Ahmed has drawn flak for promoting RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s Urdu book. The book ‘Mustaqbil Ka Bharat’ is an Urdu translation of ‘Bhavishya Ka Bharat’, a Hindi compilation of Bhagwat’s three-day lecture series delivered in 2018 at Vigyan Bhavan in New Delhi. The lectures had led to a debate on the RSS sarsanghachalak’s attempt to present Hindutva as an inclusive policy where minorities too would have equal rights. While Ahmed himself has done the Urdu translation, NCPUL has published the book. Union minister of education Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank and senior RSS leader Krishna Gopal are scheduled to launch the book at India International Centre, New Delhi, on Monday. The involvement of NCPUL, a government funded institution, in promoting the book has irked a section of Urdu writers and scholars with questions being raised if it was a bid to “popularise RSS among Muslims”. “This is gross misuse of the funds of NCPUL, whose purpose is to promote Urdu by helping out writers and poets. A book which carries the ideology of an organisation is being promoted in blatant violation of rules and ethics,” said Urdu poet and former vicechairman of Delhi Urdu Academy, Majid Deobandi. However, Ahmed justified the move. “NCPUL has translated Gita and Gurugranth Sahib in the past. This collection of lectures talks about a new India. There is nothing wrong if NCPUL is taking the book to Urdu readers,” he said. NGO Urdu Caravan’s director Farid Khan said while many Urdu poets and writers lived in penury and had no resources to publish their works, NCPUL’s director was showing an interest in promoting Bhagwat’s book.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/urdu-council-bid-to-promote-bhagwat-book-triggers-row/articleshow/81880682.cms||Mohammed Wajihudin

Congress and GFP demanded an apology from the Pramod Sawant government for the “irresponsible tweet” by the Goa tourism department. Though the state government issued a clarification regarding the tweet, the opposition said that it appeared as propaganda for the Portuguese Colonialists. Opposition leader Digambar Kamat said that Sawant should apologise for insulting the sentiments of patriotic Indians. “The contribution of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj and the Great Maratha warriors for Goa should never be forgotten. It is most unfortunate that BJP government has insulted the Maratha warriors,” Kamat said. Congress said that BJP has always remained busy in glorification of “jumla politics” while conveniently trying to “sideline the glorious history” of India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-govt-has-insulted-marathas-says-oppn/articleshow/81878562.cms||---
---||India||Harvest operations for Rabi crops not hampered by 2nd Covid wave||NEW DELHI: The second Covid-19 wave has not impacted the ongoing harvest operations in the country with farmers already harvesting over 55% of their crops as on Friday, showing continued resilience of the farm sector in the face of the pandemic. The entire harvest operation of Rabi (winter sown) crops is expected to be completed in the next 2-3 weeks, giving farmers enough time to prepare for the next crop cycle with the onset of monsoon. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) is expected to come out with its first stage monsoon forecast in the middle of this month. The harvest data, released by the agriculture ministry, show that the farmers have already harvested over 91% of oilseeds, 83% of sugarcane, 82% of pulses, 77% of coarse cereals such as maize and jowar, and over 31% of wheat at the beginning of the Rabi marketing season. Overall, Rabi crops over 390 lakh hectares of farm land out of total acreage of 697 lakh hectares were harvested till Friday. In what could be a clear sign of bumper harvest in tune with the record estimates of food-grain production in the country in the 2020-21 crop year (July-June cycle), the ministry said that all crops were in “good condition” and harvesting was “going on in full swing”. The ministry had in February estimated the country’s food-grain production in the 2020-21 crop year at an all-time record of around 303 million tonnes (MT), which is over 2% higher than the previous year's output. It showed record output of paddy (120 MT), wheat (109 MT), maize (30 MT) and gram (12 MT) in the food-grain basket. Meanwhile, sowing of summer crops (being sown ahead of monsoon) is also going on with good pace despite less rainfall during the current phase. Actual rainfall received in the country in March was 45% less compared to the normal rainfall during the period, but the summer sowing progressed well due to good soil moisture content and availability of adequate water in all major reservoirs of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/harvest-operations-for-rabi-crops-not-hampered-by-2nd-covid-wave/articleshow/81880690.cms||Vishwa Mohan

Let the council prepare an agenda and put it forward with my advice. I too will have my say over it and put my views on it,” he said. On the split in the group of 12 elected councilors, Fernandes said this is because each one wants to become the chairperson or vice-chairperson. He said that when the councillors didn’t agree to the terms and conditions set by the party leadership, no BJP leader interfered and they were given freedom to choose their leader.When asked further whether all 12 councillors would still remain loyal to BJP, Fernandes said yes. The MLA was also asked about the photothat went viral showing Rebello and his group with Margao MLA Digambar Kamat. He said that the opposition leader wanted to congratulate Rebello, who he knew from the latter’s earlier stint as chairperson. Clarifying the incident, Rebello told reporters that when he and his fellow councillors were returning from Panaji, he received a call from Kamat saying he wants to come to Canacona to congratulate him. “Since he knows us well for long, and we were on the way, I told him we would meet him. There’s not politics, we are with the BJP,” he said. Another councillor said the call came while they were travelling together. On the split in the group of 12 elected councilors, who were together initially, Isidore Fernandes said this is because each one wants to be the chairperson or vice-chairperson.

Though the incident happened on March 7, it came to light on Friday after the village volunteer lodged a complaint with Agiripalle police. Gampa Praveen Kumar, the volunteer, belongs to the same caste group as the village elders. The unconstitutional decision was apparently taken because he was accompanied by a man who was previously evicted from the village. The volunteer was given two choices — either pay a fine of Rs 5,000, or leave the village with his family. Police sources said on March 7, Praveen Kumar along with his father Pangideswara Rao and mother Dhanalakshmi had visited a place of worship at Gorantla village. They then boarded an autorickshaw to return home. The auto was driven by one Vijay Babu, who was evicted from the village around seven years ago. Some villagers informed the elders about the incident, who then summoned Praveen and his family and sought an explanation. Though they explained that it was a case of pure coincidence, the village elders were not convinced and imposed the punishment. As per the complaint filed by Praveen, the elders also abused his parents and even tried to attack them after they questioned the ‘unfair judgement’. Praveen said he tried to sort the issue out by paying the fine amount on March 28. However, the elders once again insulted him and announced that a fine Rs 10,000 would be imposed on anyone who interacts with Praveen’s family or even offers water to them. Police said they are investigating the complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/village-volunteer-ostracised-lodges-complaint/articleshow/81876347.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Visakhapatnam||Yearly 61-day ban on fishing starts April 15||VISAKHAPATNAM: The annual 61-day ban on deep sea fishing will come into effect on April 15. Nearly 30,000 fishermen across nine coastal districts in Andhra Pradesh will not venture into the sea during this period. As per an order of the Union ministry of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying, there will be a ban on fishing in the Indian Exclusive Economic (IEE) zone beyond territorial waters along the east coast from April 15 to June 14. The order applies to fisherfolk of all mechanised boats. “However, traditional non-motorised boats are exempted from the ban,” the order states. Fishermen will depend on the money they will get under the YSR Matsyakara Bharosa scheme for their livelihood during this period. “Although the order exempts non-motorised fisherfolk from the ban, we will not bother. We will depend on the YSR Matsyakara Bharosa benefit of Rs 10,000 which was launched last year,” said Arjili Dasu, executive secretary of Visakhapatnam Fishermen Youth Welfare Association. According to Dasu, some fishermen were not completely aware of the scheme last year. “But this time, almost all fishermen know about the scheme. Hence, there would be no need to go fishing during this resurgence of Covid-19,” he said. Speaking to TOI, Visakhapatnam fisheries department joint director in-charge P Lakshmana Rao said that last year more than 300 fishermen who used non-motorised boats also received assistance of Rs 10,000 under the Matsyakara Bharosa scheme. There are certain indications that the number of beneficiaries under the scheme may increase this year, said an official from the state secretariat, who informed that 1.1 lakh people received the assistance last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/yearly-61-day-ban-on-fishing-starts-apr-15/articleshow/81876356.cms||V Kamalakara Rao
